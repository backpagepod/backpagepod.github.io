> Apologies in advance to fans of Alien 3! We've ranked one of the greatest movie series of all time (even if contains a handful of flawed sequels and shite crossover films). We had a lot of fun getting into it. Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as we did.
>
> Some spoilers for Alien: Romulus follow, so if you're dying to watch that one, either skip that part of the list (in the final 30 minutes) or try to listen when you've seen it.
> 
> Thanks to Michael 'BanyaBat' Butter for the edits. And thanks to you for the support!
