> It's another mailbag episode, with about 20 minutes of what we've been playing at the start as a chaser. It's probably too long, yet again, but it covers everything from our favourite TV genres to trends in games that we miss. Enjoy!

> One factual error in this episode: Sunset Overdrive was released in 2014 rather than 2015.

> Our theme tune is by Barry 'Epoch' Topping (@nostoppingepoch on Twitter).
