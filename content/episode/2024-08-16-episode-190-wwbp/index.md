> Is Astro Bot out yet? No? What about Star Wars: Outlaws and Space Marine 2? Not right now? Still? Fine.
> 
> Then here's what we've spent our respective summers playing: an array of indie/double-A games ranging from disappointing to good. These include Anger Foot, Nobody Wants To Die, Another Code: Recollection, Thank Goodness You're Here and Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure. Plus, hear Matthew talk about the HD redo of the Ace Attorney Investigations games and Samuel ramble about Apex Legends nonsense (yet again)!
