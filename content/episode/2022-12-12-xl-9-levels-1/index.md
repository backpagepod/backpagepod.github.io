### The first level you remember experiencing as a kid and thinking, 'fuck yes this rules'

- M: SMB2 beanstalk, Rescue Rangers telephone poles, Sonic 3 Angel Island
- S: I'll explain why, but it goes: Casino Night Zone in Sonic 2, Facility in GoldenEye, D-Day (Operation Overlord) in Medal of Honor: Allied Assault

### An immersive sim or stealth game level you love

- M: Desperados 3: A Hell of a Night
- S: Majestic 12 Base/UNATCO headquarters (4th visit).

### A single player first-person shooter level you love

- M: Half-Life Alex: Jeff level
- S: The Maw, Halo: Combat Evolved.

### A multiplayer first-person shooter map you love
 
- M: cod mw Block
- S: Facing Worlds in Unreal Tournament.

### A platformer level you love

- M: SMG2 Cloudy Court Galaxy
- S: Misty Island in Jak and Daxter.

### A location you love in an RPG

- M: xenoblade 3 Aerithia Sea
- S: Zanarkand in Final Fantasy X.

### A novelty level you love from a game across any genre

- M: Psychonauts 2, Compton’s Cook-Off
- S: Ryan Amusements area, specifically the Rapture Memorial Museum from BioShock 2. 9-irony.

### A hidden or secret level you love from any game

- M: Super Smash Bros Melee. F-Zero GP Big Blue
- S: Pitioss Dungeon. Red glowing demonic-feeling spikes, traps, pillars, statues - statues in the dark.

### A hub/non-violent location in a game that's a good hang

- M: Skyhold from Dragon Age
- S: The Hanged Man in Dragon Age 2.

### An open world you love

- M: Witcher Blood and Wine, Toussaint
- S: Bullworth Town from Bully. General town area and funfair, posh borough, industrial district, asylum, and the school itself is a massive space.

### A good level from a bad game

- M: Climbing the VNC Tower in Dying Light 2
- S: Storming the Death Star at the end of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed - sort of parallels Return of the Jedi, Vader loses, so does Starkiller. Landed with me at the time. Weird game but almost felt like it earned its place as canon.
