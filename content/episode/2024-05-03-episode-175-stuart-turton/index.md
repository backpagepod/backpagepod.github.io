> Matthew speaks to one of his favourite authors, Stuart Turton. Hear about his exhausting creative process (seriously, you won't believe it), and what it takes to write a novel â€“ including his latest, The Last Murder at the End of the World. Then, in part two, hear more about Stu's love of video games, which runs incredibly deep.

> Samuel is away for this one. Matthew gets the name of the podcast slightly wrong at the start, but don't hold it against him.
> 
> This week's music is from the Return of the Obra Dinn soundtrack by Lucas Pope.

The game Stuart mentioned but couldn't remember the name of was [Requiem: Avenging Angel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem:_Avenging_Angel).
