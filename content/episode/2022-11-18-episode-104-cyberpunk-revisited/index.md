> Samuel finally played Cyberpunk 2077 properly, and had a (mostly) good time! This episode interrogates CD Projekt RED's RPG/shooter, two years after release and firmly outside the shadow of the marketing campaign that made it such a headache to write about in the first place.

> This week's music is from the Cyberpunk 2077 soundtrack by P. T. Adamczyk, Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz and Paul Leonard-Morgan.
