- Balladeer: What are your favourite Metroidvanias?
- Betamax Bandit: If you could invite any three Square Enix characters to a dinner party, who would you invite and why?
- Welsh Boy Mick: There is a back pod hashtag collab with a new Def Jam game. What are your rapper names? 
- Butterbeans: We had a lovely time in Scotland last year and are considering other parts of the country for our next journey. What parts of the UK would you recommend visiting?
- Dynamic Calories: Which of your favourite games are menus or parkour? Are there any games that look like menus but are parkour? 
- Do you know which episodes have the most listens? And do you have a personal favorite?
- Serrano: As an adult, what game have you been the most childishly excited about?
- Synthetic Man: I've been re-listening to the Ace Attorney pod this week, and I'm about to play Apollo Justice for the first time. Given Matthew's gone on the record as not liking Iris and Pearl Fey, which I don't disagree with personally, it got me wondering who he considers to be the best and worst hangs from across the series.
- Effie: What do your backlogs look like? Do you keep track of a backlog of games or just go with the flow?
- Welsh Boy Mick: Cheese Draft. Three only, one for each category.
