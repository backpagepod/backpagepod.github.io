> On this week's episode, we revisit all three Max Payne games. Section 1 is about Remedy's creation of the third-person shooter series that popularised bullet time, while section 2 covers Rockstar's effort to contemporise the character in Max Payne 3. Hopefully you'll agree we do Max justice.
>
> Then, the final section has to be heard to be believed.

> This week's music is from the Max Payne soundtrack by KÃ¤rtsy Hatakka and Kimmo Kajasto, and the Max Payne 3 soundtrack by HEALTH.
