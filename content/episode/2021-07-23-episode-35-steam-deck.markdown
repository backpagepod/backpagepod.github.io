> With Valve moving into the handheld market, we reflect on whether there's a place for a Switch-style PC in this episode. Plus! In a sequel of sorts to our Bad eBay Games Court episode, Big Sammy Holdings and Matthew Castle Productions are moving into the hardware market â€“ hear us conceptualise the (fictional) perfect handheld games console.

> This week's music is from the Heavy Rain soundtrack by the late Normand Corbeil, the Control soundtrack by Petri Alanko and Martin Stig Andersen, and the Space Harrier soundtrack by Hiroshi Kawaguchi and Yu Suzuki.
