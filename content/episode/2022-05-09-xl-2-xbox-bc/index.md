> Time for another Patreon exclusive episode! Thanks for your support. Samuel discusses 20 old Xbox games he's enjoyed revisiting on Xbox Series X via backwards compatibility, from Assassin's Creed Unity to Ninja Gaiden Black. Before that, hear our thoughts on the strengths and limitations of official emulation, and why it'll likely never get better than what Microsoft has achieved on its own hardware.
>
> This week's music is from the Mercenaries 2: World in Flames soundtrack by Peter Stormare and the Wojahn Brothers (Samuel was wrong, this isn't Peter Stormare's band, but the full track is worth a listen).
