> From Twilight Princess to Gears of War, travel back to the dawn of HD gaming in our 2006-themed retrospective podcast. Matthew and Samuel both count down their top 10 games from that year, and recall the biggest news headlines, from Peter Moore's ludicrous GTA 4 tattoo to the PS3's pricing disaster. Get ready for a comfy 2.5 hours of nostalgia (hopefully not in an unbearable way).
>
> This week's music comes from the Bully soundtrack by Shawn Lee, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess soundtrack by Toru Minegishi, Asuka Ohta and Koji Kondo, and the Rhythm Tengoku soundtrack by Tsunku and Masami Yone.

# XL 24 Revisions

## Samuel
- ❌ Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence - a cheat, a special edition of a 2005 game?
- Gears of War - head not heart
- Kingdom Hearts 2 - heart not head
- ✅ Hitman: Blood Money - between Kingdom Hearts and Loco Roco
- ⬆️？ Animal Crossing: Wild World - to number 1?

## Matthew
- ✅？ Shadow of the Colossus - Was it anti-Ueda schtick? Laying out the stall for Brand Castle?
- ❌？ Hitman: Blood Money - didn't hold up on recent replay
- ❌？ Tomb Raider Legend - not as good as Underworld or Tomb Raider: Anniversary
- ❌？ Guitar Hero 2 - mainly for Surrender by Cheap Trick
- ✅？ Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition
