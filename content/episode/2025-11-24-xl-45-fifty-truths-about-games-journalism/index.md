1. Publishers will never give you enough screenshots for a cover feature - but you'll make it work somehow. 
1. Shorter sentences are always better.
1. Writing magazine captions is hell on earth for every single writer you can think of.
1. Semicolons always give away an amateur writer.
1. Having a strong work ethic is 100 times more important in games journalism than having a degree.
1. Taking a good screenshot of a first-person shooter is basically impossible.
1. The best developer interviews are always with people who have nothing to sell.
1. Review scores are good.
1. Indie games, in 99% of cases, do not generate web traffic. 
1. Games journalism should always have the capacity to be funny – even if the audience is too thick to engage with it.
1. If you work for a long-running games media brand, no matter what you do, some grumpy fuck readers or former editors will always say it used to be better.
1. Games magazines are still a better way to learn about new games than websites.
1. People who say games journalism doesn't matter anymore always change their tune when people actually cover their games.
1. US games media and UK games media were nothing alike. And still exist in parallel realities.
1. Games media always needs more perspectives beyond white guys (ironic saying that, I know).
1. Search engines damaged everything great about games media…but the publishers prioritised short term wins over all else, so the blame is shared.
1. Guide writers will never get credit for doing a great job.
1. The future of games journalism is smaller specialist websites or video channels supported directly by their audience. 
1. Sub editors and production editors will never get credit for doing a great job.
1. Recommending people get into media now is borderline immoral, and no one should be charging for journalism degrees in 2025.
1. Podcasting is to video what print media is to online media.
1. Deals articles suck, but websites have to make money somehow. 
1. The best games magazines always created their own universe around a platform or games in general. The internet has eroded that, and given way to consensus thinking poisoning everything.
1. There is still nothing better than holding a print magazine that contains something you wrote.
1. Official Nintendo Magazine should come back.
1. Staff writer is the best job on a games magazine. Closely followed by games editor.
1. Explaining why something is good is harder than explaining why it is bad.
1. It’s a bummer that the more expertise you get, the further you seem to move away from writing.
1. You will get sick of the first hour of every game you cover at preview and review phase.
1. You work with people whose superpower is to boil things down to their core essence and they will do the same to you. Expect to become a caricature in seconds.
1. You will learn the keyboard shortcut for the accented Pokémon e or you will copy and paste it from another document every time.
1. Video and written reviews are totally different art forms. Don't try to turn one into another.
1. Working in video completely breaks how you play videogames - I'll never look at a save file the same way again.
1. Never take an appointment on the public show floor of Gamescom.
1. If you're over the word count turn your most extraneous paragraph into a boxout.
1. Rezzed was the best games expo and it’s a huge bummer it’s gone.
1. 5 stars, 10/10 and 100% are not the same score and metacritic is broken because of it.
1. Try not to over research your interview subjects - preconceptions can shape an interview in a bad way.
1. Try to review in isolation - it's always really obvious when reviewers have been on a group chat.
1. Try to end every relationship on good terms - in the UK it’s a ludicrously small industry.
1. Websites using the language of magazines - cover stories - is cultural appropriation. 
1. As depressing as it is, start with your video title and cover line and work backwards - it's difficult to add a hook after the fact.
1. There is no shame in reaching out to a developer if you get stuck during a review.
1. There's also no shame using tired conventions - a list feature - to smuggle in your best writing. Anything to get someone to read.
1. If you’re late to the party, there’s no point joining a reviews pile-on - choose to elevate something good instead.
1. The most important entry in a list feature is the lowest entry - use it to set the tone, mess with expectation and get people excited for the list to come.
1. Reviewers shouldn’t give a range of hours for how long a game takes - it didn't take you a range of hours.
1. Don't fill your magazine redesign with concepts that only make sense with a four month run-up.
1. Under every journalist’s jumper is a terrible branded t-shirt. No shame in it.
1. NGamer should come back.
