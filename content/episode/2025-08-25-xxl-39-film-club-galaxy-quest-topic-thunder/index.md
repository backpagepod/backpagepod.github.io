> For once, we picked some slightly more normal films for a Film Club Patreon episode (no Threads!). Comedies Galaxy Quest and Tropic Thunder were our selections this month, both films that put slightly over-the-hill actor characters in life-or-death situations. And those are the parts in each film that held up the best for us.
