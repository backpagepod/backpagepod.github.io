>
> This week's music is from the Yakuza 0 and Yakuza 6 soundtracks by Hidenori Shoji.

### Rankings

(We should also start with the reasons why a couple of them didn't make the Top 5, as an excuse to air my grudges about Kiwami 1 and Yakuza 4)

5. Judgment
4. Kiwami 2
3. Yakuza: Like a Dragon
2. Yakuza 0
1. Yakuza 5 (I am willing to be overruled on this, as it's Spicy, but I think it's appropriate for this series to celebrate the one that is the most extra.)
