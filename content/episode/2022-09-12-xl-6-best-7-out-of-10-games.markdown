> What makes a true 7/10 game? Is it a diamond in the rough, rife with enough offbeat personality that it wedges itself into your brain for years to come? Or is it closer to a licensed game made by Acclaim in the '90s?  In this episode, we boil down the idea of what a 7/10 game is, making it far more confusing than it really should be. Then, we'll fire through some of our own favourite 7/10s in the second half.
