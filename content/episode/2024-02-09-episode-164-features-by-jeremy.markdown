> Beloved guest Jeremy Peel drops by to discuss his new Patreon project, The Peel Perspective, as well as the art of writing a magazine or website feature about video games.

> Did we nail this episode? Ack, not *quite*. As Matthew put it after the edit, it's fine. We didn't entirely have the right energy for it this week, nor did we have a tight enough plan to conquer such a big subject in the second half. Always lovely to have Jeremy back on, though.

> This week's music is from the System Shock remake by Jonathan Peros.
