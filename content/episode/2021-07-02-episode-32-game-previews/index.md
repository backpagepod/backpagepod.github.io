> How do you write about a game that's not actually finished yet? In this episode, we dig into the art of writing games magazine cover features, covering weird demos and dealing with the hype cycle in general. Hear about our experiences visiting the studios behind PokÃ©mon and Assassin's Creed, and more embarrassing stories about throwing hot chocolate in toilets and going to the bathroom on a New York City freeway.
