> As voted for by you (well, about 26% of you, so it's not particularly democratic), this month's XL episode is all about the 2000 N64 Rare FPS Perfect Dark. From its inconsistent but ambitious campaign to its frantically entertaining multiplayer, we dig deep into what's aged well about this game – as well as what's had us screaming at the telly.

> Look out for another poll for a future XL episode when we're through the next wave of big games. And thanks for your support, as ever!
