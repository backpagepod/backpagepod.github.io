### Resident Evil
- Live-action intro to the original, with the goofiest James Cameron riff you can think of
- The first zombie you meet
- Moonlight Sonata on the piano
- “You were almost a Jill sandwich” (lowering ceiling setpiece)
- Lisa Trevor being generally terrifying in her cabin
- Shark in Remake (slightly crap puzzle, but looks cool)

### Resident Evil 2
- The opening, including the crash and Robert Kendo biting the dust in the gunshop. (Original and Remake)
- The Licker appears on the ceiling (original)
- Zombies pulling themselves out of morgue locker
- Mr X (was scary once, now a bit too much of a meme)

### Resident Evil 3
- Resi 3 remake literally peaks in its first 10 minutes with a rad first-person hallucination sequence then Nemesis turns up
- Nemesis shoots down the helicopter and you realise you’re fuckin’ stuck with him (original and remake, I think)
- Blowing up final boss with railgun (remake)

### Resident Evil: Code Veronica X
- The opening cinematic - impressive for the time
- The fight in the mist with Nosferatu looks cool
- I liked the Darkside Chronicles fight with Alfred Ashford
- Wesker confronts Alexia then fucks off

### Resident Evil 0
- The train is cool, including fight with giant scorpion

### Resident Evil 4
- The village rush
- The bit in the house
- The boss fight in the barn with Mendez
- The first time you meet the merchant - this welcome alliance in a strange land
- Wesker vs Krauser QTE knife fight “Been a long time, comrade!” “You may be able to prolong your life, but it's not like you can escape your inevitable death, is it?” (original only)
- Then the Krauser fight itself (both)
- Mine cart chase (remake only)
- Running away from the Salazar statue (original only)
- The bit on the throne

### Resident Evil 5
- The village rush - dude with a megaphone. Mirrors the Resi 4 opening nicely
- “Seven minutes. Seven minutes is all I can spare to play with you.”
- Chris beats the shit out of that rock
- Being chased by two chainsaw guys on an oil rig
- Irving - sea monster fight
- Chris doing a haymaker
- Fighting Wesker in the hangar - better than the last boss
- Lost in Nightmares DLC raising the idea of over shoulder camera Resi 1

### Resident Evil 6
- Ustanak coming back with increasingly ludicrous arm implements (6 times)
- Boss in Chris campaign - Haos - is genuinely spectacular

### Resident Evil 7
- Approaching the house for the first time
- Dinner table with the Bakers (even though they’re all tough hangs)
- The video tape experiences - especially that initial one with the cellar
- The reveal that Mia is a covert operative, so the story flips

### Resident Evil: Village
- That giant fuckin’ baby
- Looking for the doll in the house
- Game possibly peaks with the death of Lady Dimitrescu in terms of threat level, but it’s nice to tick her off the list

### Assorted Resi ephemera if relevant (Revelations, etc)
- Revelations 2 - Barry and Natalia co-op mechanic
- Revelations 2 - good co-op end boss
