> Everything except Zelda is discussed in this week's episode! It's a 'what we've been playing' joint, featuring Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Arkane's Redfall and Mad Max (2015), among other things. We also answer a ton of mailbag questions, some of which we might've answered before â€“ who knows!

> This week's music is from the Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed soundtrack.
