### Best Mario Moments

1. Super Mario Bros - Grabbing a Fire Flower in Super Mario Bros
2. Super Mario Bros - caning it to the top of a level and realising you can access Warp Zones into other levels
3. Mario Is Missing - Fucking a Koopa up in Marrakech or some bullshit
4. Super Mario Bros 2 - going to clouds and decking Birdo
5. Super Mario Bros 3 - airships were cool, but I like the special coin ship (the idea of rare surprises feels long gone) 
6. Super Mario Bros 3 - fighting the sun, this ongoing duel with darting orb
7. Super Mario Bros. 3 - Kuribos Shoe/ Goombas Shoe - the power up with no love. World 5-3 only. But I love the nod to it in the ice skate in 3D World
8. Super Mario World - Donut Secret House - the great vibe of ghost house, and it has a big motherfuckin' boo
9. Super Mario Bros Deluxe - getting a fuckton of points and unlocking the Lost Level
10. Super Mario 64 - butt stomping whomp king (bonus shout out to remade version in Galaxy 2)
11. Super Mario 64 - Tick Tock Clock. Great platforming gauntlet with cool trick of speed change based on when you enter.
12. Super Mario 64 - Big Boo's Haunt is legit stressful and scary. Piano with teeth - Resi never did anything that fucked up.
13. Super Mario Sunshine - the reflective solar panels + shout-out to following wiggler fight - knocking him over with sand is ace.
14. Super Mario Sunshine - the elasticity of Bloopers tentacle tugs or yanking tails of the chain chomp dog things.
15. Super Mario Sunshine - losing the backpack. Navigating gooey inferno in Pianta Village is almost immersive sim-y - people using the water from river to clear a path.
16. Super Mario Galaxy - the Gusty Garden music and that YouTube video
17. Super Mario Galaxy - walloping bouldergeist with the boo bombs
18. Super Mario Galaxy - the Rolling Green Galaxy
19. Super Mario Galaxy - ice skating on the ice donut at the start of Freeze Flame Galaxy. It’s just an animation triumph and a lovely time waster. - Better use of of it in Shiverburn Galaxy in Galaxy 2.
20. Super Mario Galaxy - the gravity flipping of Bowser’s Dark Matter Plant (I also dig the bowser fights in this - predicting his trajectory to whack him will always be good).
21. Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Yoshi is quite good in this one. Grappling over gaps, running up vertical surfaces. A power up with power ups.
22. Super Mario galaxy 2 - Cloud Mario
23. Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Flip Out Galaxy - alternating platform pieces controlled by spin jump - lots of wall jump which is always good. Vertical version of Flip Swap Galaxy.
24. Super Mario 3D Land - realising they built a game where the camera truly gets the most out of the 3DS' 3D feature
25. Super Mario 3D Land - being chased by cosmic clones so you can never catch a breath
26. Super Mario 3D Land - there's twice as much game here than I realised
27. Super Mario 3D World - exploring a 3D Mario level with another person
28. Super Mario 3D World - trying to control Plessie the dinosaur simultaneously
29. Super Mario 3D World - Beep Block Skyway - blocks changing on the beat
30. Super Mario 3D World - the Bowser Express is a fuckin' great boss fight
31. Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Plessie is now an open world vehicle
32. Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Crisp Climb castle with the Propellor Box powerup - good showcase for it
33. Super Mario Odyssey - the retro 2d levels are all great, but 2D Secret Treasure in Mushroom Kingdom has proper galaxy gravity. Sublime.
34. Super Mario Odyssey - Koopa Freerunning - where you realise just how capable Odyssey mario is.
35. Any Mario level where it's just some cake
