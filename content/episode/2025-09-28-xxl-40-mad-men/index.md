> Revisiting the amazing first season of Mad Men, the 2007-2015 drama about fictional American ad agency, Sterling Cooper.
>
> If you don't want to watch all 13 episodes of season 1 to follow along with this (totally reasonable!), fear not: the first hour is basically a spoiler-free chat of why we loved this show so much. We hope you enjoy this either way!
>
> In the UK, Mad Men is all streaming on Netflix, while in the US, it's currently showing on AMC+ (which presumably 8 people in total have access to).
