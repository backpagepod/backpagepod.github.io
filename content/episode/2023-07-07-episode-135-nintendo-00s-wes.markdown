> Our guest this week is PC Gamer Senior Editor Wes Fenlon, who talks to us about his career in games media, his newsletter [Read Only Memo](https://www.readonlymemo.com/), and Nintendo during the GameCube/GBA episode. You'll also hear about some of the differences between UK and US games media, and a quick therapy session for Samuel's benefit. A lot of ground is covered in this one – enjoy!

> This week's music is from Cubivore, probably? Matthew edited this one and didn't say where the music came from – and at the time of writing he's on a train to Belgium, so who really knows.
