> From Monkey Island to Full Throttle, we try to boil down the complete library of Lucasarts adventure games into five representative titles â€“ building a hall of fame, the concept of which we stole from a film podcast we like. Former GamesTM editor Ashley Day joins us for this one. Note that our originally scheduled episode, GTA clones on trial, is now coming next week.
>
> This week's music is from The Secret of Monkey Island soundtrack by Michael Land and Patrick Mundy.
