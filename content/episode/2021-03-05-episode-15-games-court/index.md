> Samuel Roberts stands accused of crimes against good taste – will the honorable judge Matthew Castle find him innocent or guilty, based on 18 dodgy eBay games purchases made over the past 12 months? We also talk about the idea of collecting games generally in this episode, and reveal how big our Steam libraries are.
>
> This week's music is from the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack by Lex Horton and the Phoenix Wright trilogy soundtrack by Masakazu Sugimori and Akemi Kimura.
