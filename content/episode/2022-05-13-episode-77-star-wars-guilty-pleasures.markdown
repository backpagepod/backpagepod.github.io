> In this week's episode, Samuel catalogues the Star Wars games that exist between simple notions like light and dark – these are the 6 and 7/10 Star Wars games that are nonetheless interesting in a bunch of ways. A full best Star Wars games episode is coming later this year, so look forward to that.

> This week's music is from the Star Wars: The Force Unleashed soundtrack by Mark Griskey.

- The Force Unleashed (a lavish but clumsy attempt at making a Star Wars God of War with wacky physics - Havok, Euphoria, DMM)
- The Force Unleashed 2 (an even worse and shorter version of the above)
- Galactic Battlegrounds (be careful what you wish for when you ask for Star Wars Age of Empires)
- Racer Revenge (pod racing with episode 2 Anakin - just a touch worse than the original in every way)
- Jedi Starfighter ("we've got Rogue Leader on PS2 at home")
- Rebel Assault 2 (naff FMV games but original Star Wars content in a deprived mid-'90s)
- Shadows of the Empire (a third-person shooter bookended with minigames - and a wider multimedia project)
- Battlefront 2 - the EA one (campaign doesn't do what they said it would and not a great online shooter, but a lovely bit of Star Wars to dip into)
- Battle For Naboo (in the Rogue Squadron template but not quite as good - ground sections and Episode I settings make it a tougher sell)
- Rogue Leader 2: Rebel Strike (great spaceship bits cancelled out by rancid on-foot sections)
