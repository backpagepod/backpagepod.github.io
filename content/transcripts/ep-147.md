Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we are joined by another special guest. Jamie, would you like to introduce yourself?
Hello, yeah, nice to meet you both again. So I'm Jamie Smith. I'm a principal game designer.
I'm currently working for People Can Fly at the moment. And I've been in games for about 13 and a half years, kind of at this point. I've worked on a whole bunch of different games, AAA, big titles like The Division, FIFA, Call of Duty, and then some kind of smaller kind of IPs, such as Hood Outlaws and Legends.
But yeah, and at the moment I'm working at People Can Fly, but unfortunately I can't talk too much more about what projects I'm currently working on.
That's what you think. We'll pummel you for answers.
Okay, so Jamie, you listen to the podcast. So is it surreal recording this with us? Is that a bit strange?
I mean, me and Matthew, we don't regard ourselves as particularly special or anything. Like I'm just a man, like literally in his pants, in a flat recording a podcast. But is it like, I guess if somebody's listened to it before, is it particularly interesting coming on for the first time?
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's interesting because you're both the sounds of my morning kind of gym routine and fitness. So I go up quite early, listen to a bunch of podcasts and things.
So that's, you know, when I hear your voice, it makes me sound like I'm on a walk on a morning. You know, it's the soothing kind of tones, but yeah, it's pretty cool.
Oh, awesome. Yeah, it was really great to have you. So this episode is about things you only realize when you make games.
So really liked that idea for an episode and also sort of ran that bus, Jamie, knowing his amazing variety of experience. Jamie did sort of reach out as well and said, I would love to come on the podcast. I've been on podcasts before and I have worked on all these games and we've had like a really good response before when we've had Jay Bayliss on the podcast and Lucy, of course.
So we wanted to bring in more game dev and guests who understand what the pod's about, what the remit is, that sort of thing. So excited to have you here, Jamie. So I've got loads of questions here.
You have made more notes than any guest we've ever had by about 5,000 times. Like you have so many, you have like basically 3,000 words of notes going on in the margins of our G-Doc. Like would you care to explain your creative process?
Probably that I just have a mind like a sieve. So there's a whole bunch of things that I could kind of bring to the table. It might just remind us than anything else.
But at the same time, you know, one part of being a designer is being kind of meticulous in your approach and your preparation and things. So I think put it down to those two things. I'm a goldfish, but equally, I'm just trying to over-prepare.
Are you a big documentation guy? Do you have like good confluence pages and all that stuff?
Yes, I think a big part of it now is you have to assume, especially if you're working on huge games, the teams or the people that are reading those documents could be all over the world and they don't necessarily want to read, you know, War and Peace or the Bible or something. They want information kind of as quickly as possible, as succinctly as possible on things like confluence, you know, to online kind of Wiki pages. And yeah, basically just trying to make that as streamlined as possible for people is not the only part being a designer, but definitely it's a big aspect of it.
Okay, well, I'm pleased you applied that process to our podcast planning process. So yeah, I've got a bunch of questions to ask you in section one about what it is that you do and what you kind of like learn from what you do. And also, and then we get to the second part.
And that's where Jamie has some, I would say, really good insights on games more generally, things like common designs, design problems, cursed design problems is a category we have to discuss, common pitfalls when producing a new IP, all stuff that Jamie has suggested and we'd love to talk about. So excited to get into it. So to start us off then, Jamie, what does a principal game designer actually do?
Yeah, so there's a couple of different things. The first thing that nobody ever talks about is that realistically on any project, and I should say that everything I'm about to mention is from a triple A kind of perspective. So again, when you mentioned Jay Bayless, other people you might have on the podcast still have different experiences.
But the first thing that nobody tells you is that there's not really such a thing as a game designer in the sense that when you first get a job in games, you're lucky to work on a feature which will be a small portion of the game. And ideally, you'll be working with somebody kind of more experienced who maybe owns that particular feature. So if you took, let's say, the Mario games as a really basic example, there will be a designer that kind of owns Mario.
That will realistically be a principal designer. But that person isn't necessarily a game designer. They're just the person that takes care of Mario or they take care of that one piece of the pie kind of thing.
So by the time you get to a principal kind of role, as you go through the ranks, from an intermediates to a senior to a principal, it's effectively thinking of it as your ownership or what portion of the game do you own kind of grows. Maybe you own Mario and you own Luigi. Maybe you own all of the enemy types, exactly.
And Peach, don't forget Toad.
Chief Toad Engineer, yeah, that sort of thing.
Exactly, yeah, yeah, and the way I kind of look at it is really there's only one game designer on the project and that's the creative director, the top person, the Hideo Kojima and things. They're the people that have the vision for what the game is gonna be there, looking at it holistically, but most designers are just representative of a portion of the game. And again, it's just your responsibility, your autonomy over that.
And then what those people do, especially on the design side is we're basically working with mixed discipline teams. So this is artists, animators, programmers, every single discipline, including writers, things like that, to bring together features working towards established goals. And those goals normally come from a vision.
And that vision comes from the creative director. So if it's more like a Resident Evil, you're trying to make a game that is cautious, the player is on the back foot. Those might be some of the goals for the project.
Okay, how do you translate that into tasks and features and behaviors in the game? And the other way I'd describe it is a director ultimately is responsible for the why and the what. Why are we doing this game and what the game is about?
Whereas a designer is more responsible for the how and the who. How are we gonna bring this thing to life and who are the people that we need to do it?
Right, okay, that's interesting. Does that ever get mixed up where the vision changes and people who are below the creative director get to inform how that changes or is it always like, there is always that delineation between, the creative director owns this and you own this part of it.
Yeah, generally speaking, it's coming from the creative director in terms of where he wants to go with it. Well, he or she wants to go with the game and know what direction they wanna take. But sometimes a game could be, maybe this is something for later in the podcast, but I'll touch upon it now.
A game could be kind of bottom up or top down. And what I mean by that is if it's a bottom up process, it might be a particular mechanic in the game that you build around. So for example, Mario again, Mario is a really cool character, that's a bottom up kind of process.
Okay, we've got this really cool character, a really interesting move set. What do we do with it? Whereas a top down process would be, hey, we've got this cool idea to put Mario in space.
It's two different approaches of effectively get into the same thing. But to answer the original question is, sometimes it could be led by a certain mechanic, a director wants to take the game in a certain place, but actually somebody comes up with a certain feature for that game that kind of takes a life of its own. And then maybe that starts to become the new kind of direction.
Right, right, that's interesting. That kind of explains, I guess bottom up would be the process they apply to the Titanfall 2 campaign, for example, where they already knew what the fundamentals were of Titanfall. Right, okay, yeah, built it around that.
Okay, super interesting. Appreciate you using Mario, though, as an example that me and Matthew can grasp. That's good.
We do appreciate that. So yeah, I'm excited to dig into loads of stuff with you here, Jamie, but I suppose to go back to the very start, where does your love of games come from?
So I'm, well, coming up to 35 this year, so kind of late 80s, kind of early 90s. The first console that I ever had, and it's funny hearing this, because I heard Matthew in a podcast this morning saying, there's one era that isn't worth playing anymore, and it's exactly the era that I was part of, which was the Master System.
Should I say that?
Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know, because as I say, I've been going through some backlog kind of episodes, but it was more about, so I started with the Master System, and the Master System 8-bit kind of era, vastly kind of inferior to pretty much everything that came after, there's not really that much of a reason to kind of go back to it. But my parents bought that for me when I was maybe four or five at the time, so kind of early 90s, the Mega Drive was probably on the scene at that kind of point. But the cool thing about that was, is that everything on the Master System was pretty much dirt cheap.
So I didn't mention this earlier, but you know, the pre-owned kind of episodes and the games caught kind of stuff, I actually listened to that stuff because I'm a big fan of kind of old game prices and things. And I used to pick up games for a snip on that kind of platform. So that's kind of where it all started for me and kind of progressed from there.
But for some reason, I skipped the kind of 16 bit era entirely. So I never owned those consoles, Mega Drive or SNES. I used to have family friends, neighbors on the road, not over the river, unfortunately, but just next door.
So I used to borrow their consoles when they used to go on holiday, played all the classics, Streets of Rage, Sonic and things. But the next console I had was the N64 and that was kind of very slim pickings. It was at a time where you only got a game for your birthday and Christmas.
And if you were lucky, Easter, it was that kind of side of it. So if I was lucky.
Wow, that's great. I mean, much rather an N64 game than another freaking chocolate egg.
Yeah, especially if it was some cheap chocolate. But I do remember one year, I got a, I think it was Super Mario 64 and a Super Mario egg, you know, kind of in the same year. And that was the present.
So that was pretty cool. But.
Oh man, even the best life ever by the sounds of it, jeez. I don't think I have a single memory as good as that from my childhood, getting a game and an egg to match. That's incredible stuff.
But yeah, good stuff. Sorry, Jamie, carry on.
No, no, it's okay. Again, I don't want to go through kind of the whole history, but the reason why I mentioned the N64, and it's a big part of this podcast as well, is everything to do with the Nintendo at that point, or prior to that point, I was all in for Sega. I used to look at kind of Nintendo platforms as kind of the kiddy kind of devices.
I used to have some friends that was slightly older and borrowed their machines and some older cousins. They were all the kind of the cooler kids playing Sega. And it wasn't until N64 that it just, it completely flipped the other way for me.
I went from not really enjoying kind of Nintendo games or the look of Nintendo games to basically just being enamored by all of the kind of the top, you know, Super Mario 64, GoldenEye, and then all the way down to, you know, the slightly more cursed titles, Space Station, Silicon Valley and things like that. But that's my fondest kind of memories come from the N64 really.
Sure. So I guess what are your key texts? What defines your sensibilities?
Because I think what is interesting looking at your career is, as we'll get into, you've worked on like such a massive variety of games across different genres. Like you say, FIFA and Call of Duty are really other ends of the spectrum. But what are your key texts?
What informs your sensibilities ultimately as a designer?
Yeah, I mean, these days, I suppose it kind of changes. Maybe since the Souls games have came out, and I've heard you say this in the podcast a few times, is that how many games, you know, haven't been influenced by that. So more modern times, I do like the grouping together, slightly harder kind of challenges, you know, going back to the Master System era, you know, Shadow of the Beast.
Whenever anybody says Dark Souls is a hard game, I point them to Shadow of the Beast, and try surviving that for 30 seconds. So yeah, I quite like those games because they remind me of kind of the older times where it was a bit harder. There was an era where I was really into open world games, and now I play them quite kind of infrequently, only in the sense that I kind of fatigue myself when I was working for Ubisoft because the majority of games at the time Ubisoft were making were open world games.
And it was hard to kind of see beyond what they were kind of doing and the types of things that were influencing other open world games and you know, a lot of the repetition. Whereas nowadays, I'm a big fan of immediacy, co-op, slightly cursed one. I'd not mentioned to you both at this point, but I listened to a whole bunch of episodes on this podcast whilst playing Earth Defense Force, World Brothers, you know, the Minecraft kind of style one.
So played that loads and listening to the podcast.
I guess that is cursed, but fundamentally Earth Defense Force. I think we're pro that, right Matthew on this podcast. We think that's, I think that's a good hang ultimately.
Yeah, I'm not gonna make an enemy of the Earth Defense Force a lot.
The Earth Defense Force, Defense Force, basically. The EDFDF, yeah, okay. Okay, fair enough, Jamie.
So, I think that's the only way to stomach Games Court is to play a video game to sort of like, counteract the effects, the psychic damage of Games Court. So, sounds good to me, but yeah, okay. So, yeah, so I guess different types of experience.
You're much of a Vermintide guy, you play a bit of Darktide, that sort of thing.
Yeah, anything along those lines, you know, pick up and play, drop in and out co-op, I'm a big fan of. I've not really played too much of Darktide. I saw there's been some patches recently that have improved it, but when I was at Ubisoft, the lunchtime game used to be, I mean, I'm talking maybe 10 years ago now, the lunchtime game was Left 4 Dead 1 and 2, and then the evening game was not Vermintide, but things to that kind of effect, you know, drop in and out co-op, and then lunchtime was straight back to Left 4 Dead again.
So anything that you could pick up and play, 15 to 20 minute kind of sessions, if somebody's under ranked, you can kind of pull them along. If somebody's under ranked, they can still make meaningful progress. You know, any of that kind of stuff is what I'm looking for now.
I'm just not a big fan of games where you have, or if I put it differently, when people say things like, this game gets really good after 10 hours, I'm out. You know, when people say things like that.
That's fair enough, yeah. I think a lot of people have reached that point. I mean, Matthew at the moment are all, you know, we're both trying to get through about five different games that are 100 hours long, and it is quite exhausting.
But yeah, I think that is interesting though, that you kind of, I guess you want games that respect your time, right? That sounds like the sort of thing that you're seeking these days.
Yeah, in summary, for sure. And you know, something I was gonna touch upon later on, you know, from a previous podcast about, you know, games that when you download off game pass, it's quite disposable and maybe it's got like an hour to kind of really grab your attention before you just move on to the next game. I wouldn't say I'm kind of as disposable as that, but at the same time, there is so many games on there, you know, something like a Steam backlog or the game pass that if a game's not, if I've only got, you know, 40 minutes or an hour to play a game, if it's not grabbed me in 10 minutes, I'll probably go back to something familiar, you know, like a Vermintide or wherever else it may be.
Yeah, Tony, get what you mean. Recently, I just installed Lies of P, the Pinocchio Bloodborne game, and realized that I still have WoLong, the last game that was a bit like Sekiro on my Xbox still to play, and then realized that yes, maybe this has not promoted the best habits in me as a player. So what led to games as a career for you, Jamie?
Yeah, so I'm from the Northeast, and there's kind of hubs around the UK for games, you know, Leamington Spa, Guildford, you know, Brighton kind of more recently. And historically, the Northeast has had a lot of the old kind of manufacturers like, you know, Atomic Planet, Reflections, you know, Midway had a base up here. Acclaimed it at one point.
And most of the people that were from those companies, some are still around, some are now defunct, but they became kind of lecturers at local universities or they did kind of, you know, local kind of programs. And Teesside at the time, so again, I'm from the Northeast, so Teesside University had a games course at the time, which was called Creative Visualization. And the first time I'd ever come across that course, I was 16 and again, slightly cursed, but my mother had put me on some kind of summer school for two weeks, so we had a six week break in the summer.
I was at summer school at Teesside University where you could see basically the creative for emerging kind of technologies, which at the time was a giant room, which was like a VR lab of them showing how they were using computers to basically make airplanes and to demo them landing into airports, making 3D models and things like that. And the combination of those two things, the awareness of a local university, the outreach of ex-developers kind of in the area, and then also reading games magazines like Games Master and N64 Magazine, they used to have cut out sections that would say, here's what you need to do to become a game designer. So the three things kind of coalesced kind of together.
And then at the time, I used to play a lot of football games and I used to just do things like editing kind of the values. I used to play, you know, what you might call now is modding. So basically things that are changing player values, you know, upsetting the balance of the game.
If you were playing something like, you know, Diddy Kong Racing, I used to get so good at that game that I would make my own rules on my own limitations. So effectively that's what a designer is doing is, you know, making their own fun house rules kind of thing. And yeah, I went to college.
Did you ever make Diddy Kong Racing fun?
Yeah, I was waiting for that. It's one of my favorites, unfortunately, to bring up here, but yeah, I did enjoy it. But for sure, the final third of that game is pretty painful.
Are you a big like 1v4 kind of player, Jamie? Did you like Evolve, for example, were you into that sort of game?
Not so much, actually. I mean, I've played The Predator, kind of hunting grounds. I've played a bit of Evolve.
You know, one game that I did work on, which was Hoods, you know, that's more of a 4v4, but with almost like a third team. I like the idea of those games, but in practice, they never quite work out the way that you might expect them to. But even when we used to play maybe House Rules, if you know, maybe football games or, you know, TimeSplitters, another Back Page cursed game there.
But yeah, TimeSplitters.
I like TimeSplitters. It's Matthew who doesn't like TimeSplitters. I'm all in on TimeSplitters.
I have no beef with-
That's one of my bad takes.
I have no beef with David Doack, to be clear. But yeah, sorry, Jamie, continue.
No, that's great. I mean, just on that point, you said about kind of games where it's one versus four. That's the type of thing we would do on, even on Halo as well as you said on Xbox.
What one of us was really good with the sniper rifle. Okay, this round, here's some restrictions that are in place upon you because you're so good at the game. Or we three can stay on the ground in the Warthogs.
You have to stay up high and try and kill us within, you know, five minutes or something. So that's kind of, that's like the nuggets of the design kind of side of it. And I went to a college course, met a couple of friends there that basically been lifelong friends since my two friends, Kelly and Kyle.
And between the three of us, we did a games course. We didn't do a games course. We did a design course that led to games.
And that games course went on to the Teesside University. And then I basically got a job straight from that in what was a Dragon's Den scenario where there was four people on the opposite side of the table. I had to do a pitch about a game idea.
At least three of those four tore it to shreds, for a 21 year old at the time, their first time kind of showing off an idea. And the one person that took pity on me is the person that gave me my first job. And that was at Ubisoft.
And I've been in games pretty much ever since.
What was the game you pitched, if you don't mind me asking?
Yeah, it's not a problem. It's not a sore point. So I used to like, I still like fighting games, you know, the one-on-one Street Fighter Mortal Kombat.
So the pitch itself was just for a game where it didn't matter how many times you hit somebody, it just mattered where you hit them. So let's say in the head does more damage than in the body, and in the body does more damage than the legs and so on. And there was a couple of extra ideas on top of that that they thought was kind of strained too far away of what was popular with the genre at the time.
And one of the people that was on the opposite side of the table was from Eidos at the time where they were kind of at their peak. I think it was kind of Hitman, you know, Lara Croft and things like that were kind of coming out. And I've heard since that at that time, Eidos were pretty hardcore in terms of their feedback.
You know, if there was one place you didn't want to be to get harsh feedback, it was them. And yeah, one of those four was on the panel and he didn't like their idea.
He was just like, needs more tombs, mate.
Well, I can say it didn't stop Angel of Darkness or Deus Ex Invisible War from- Exactly, yeah. Burning of bridges before you've even started.
That's interesting. It's funny, were you much of a Fight Night guy? Cause Fight Night kind of lives by those principles really.
It's sort of like a more realistic fighting game where obviously hitting the head does more damage to the body. Was that something you played at all?
Yeah, I tried that. I think it was Fight Night 3 I played quite a bit of and then the date was at Champion. And I think Champion had the story and I think I kind of dropped out at that point.
But I do remember that that used to be a really cool game but I think it was a little awkward to play because you had to do motions with the right stick and the left stick and sometimes you would get the punch that you wanted, sometimes you wouldn't. But yeah, I used to play that stuff, ready to rumble a bunch of others. But yeah, the Fight Night series was pretty good.
Your first job is working at Ubisoft Reflections, right? On Driver San Francisco as a junior designer. Driver San Francisco, of course, being a Jeremy Peel classic.
And what was that like for you?
Yeah, so I came in towards the tail end of the project. So the project itself maybe was five or six years long, which was very long at the time. I mean, that's pretty much the standard these days.
But four years, the project had been in development. I joined in production and I was there for the last 18 months, of which it was not chaos, but just controlled chaos to try and get the game to light. They had some brilliant multiplayer that was set up at the time.
They had a story that was pretty cool. But if you've seen the story, since it's about a character that goes into a coma, that was almost like the topping for the bottom up method we mentioned earlier. And the bottom up method was it had a shift mechanic, which was you could zap out of a car and teleport into any other car in the world.
And this was in a time before GTA V came out where you could teleport between the multiple characters. And it was basically just effectively adding more content to the game was what we did for the last 18 months. They had a big open world.
They had a story, but not a lot of reason to stick around. So I was part of the teams that were balancing the chase missions, introducing new kind of races to the game. There's a big camera system that they use to kind of showcase shots of the city.
My first kind of touch point with Achievements, which is almost like a rite of passage for most designers, you know, to setting up a trophy or achievement set. But yeah, it was pretty cool, but really busy.
Yeah, I got to say actually that Driver San Francisco might be the most bottom-up game of all time in terms of how obvious it is to the player that that's how it was made. That's praise rather than criticism, but no, that's really cool. That's an exciting thing to come into.
So you then worked on The Crew, right? So what sort of elements matter when you're designing a game where you control cars rather than people? Because a lot of your later games do involve controlling people rather than vehicles.
So I guess like what were the challenges of working on that one?
Yeah, so this was at the tail end of that era where you kind of had the late, maybe PS2 up to the early PS4 kind of era was probably some of the best driving games that you could kind of get. And The Crew was coming out from the team that was... They did Test Drive Unlimited.
So they had this really cool network feature that each car had a bubble, and an invisible bubble that if you intersected with another player, that bubble acted like a portable kind of server so you would blend into other players. And that's basically where the pain starts in terms of things that you have to consider, especially in a multiplayer game. Because if a player can just appear in your session, how do you kind of manage that?
Imagine if I was driving along, and I'm coming to the finish line, and let's say Matthew appears in my game on the finish line and blocks me from kind of winning the race, that would not be a particularly satisfying thing to kind of consider. So they had to manage mission-based kind of portability, so players that could join you pre-mission versus the open world. Griefing, as I said earlier, you can just push other cars kind of into the sea, so you have to manage kind of collisions between other players.
You've also got the size of the kind of the threats in the world as well. So you've got different enemy cars, which could be the police, for example, in this case. In some games, the Need for Speed games, for example, will make the police cars much bigger than the player's car, because in your rearview mirror, with perspective, that car will be a tiny dot, so they'll artificially increase the size of the car.
So that's another good one. Yeah, there's just lots of little things like that. And then the classic kind of sensation of speed stuff.
Most really fast driving games will use horizontals. So anything that is street lights that kind of cross the road, ropes, you know, like telephone wires and things like that. If you watch the Formula One, and you go in kind of that tunnel in Monaco, anything with kind of, you know, pillared kind of barriers, these are things that just create the sensation of speed.
But a lot of people probably don't consider what happens in a multiplayer scenario a lot of the time.
So that was Ivory Tower leading that one. Does that mean that you went from your first project driver being developed in-house where you're working to basically supporting another studio? Is that how that worked?
That's exactly right, yeah. So Driver San Francisco was Reflection-owned and Reflection kind of worked on, you know, that they're considered kind of the lead studio on that project. And then Ubisoft, not just for Ivory Tower, but for other studios, would have a project that they would lead on.
And then other studios would support. So Ivory Tower were leading on the crew. They'd just been bought in from, I think, at the time they were an external studio and then Ubisoft bought them in-house.
They'd just come off working on Test Drive and then the idea was to effectively make Ubisoft's version of Test Drive with reflections and some other studios helping them out.
Right, that makes sense. Was that intimidating to you as a young designer having to go from working on a project, I guess, where everyone leading it was in the building where you worked, presumably, to, you know, it's being made in France and you're helping out kind of thing?
Yeah, I think at the time the studio itself became a multi-project studio. So the crew was one of the projects. Watch Dogs was another project.
This was before Watch Dogs was kind of announced. And then also Just Dance was another project that they had a yearly kind of refresh of the title, which was really good in terms of not only monetizing, but it was a really strong kind of casual audience, especially on the Wii and things like that. And some part of it was kind of a 50-50, I would say less 50-50 in terms of the lead support, but more 50-50 in terms of some people just wanted to work on Driver forever, and some people never wanted to work on the Driver franchise again.
So opening the door to a quick turnaround project after a six-year project, and you can go work on Just Dance for 12 months and get another credit on your CV is pretty appealing to people. And equally, Ubisoft's next big franchise, which at the time was Watch Dogs, you can go work on effectively Ubisoft's Grand Theft Auto. That's the way they were kind of pitching it at the time.
So, yeah, it just depends on what people's disposition was.
I see in my podcast plan here, I've wrote, you also worked on The Division, a pretty massive, and then The Sentence is dense. That's why I don't work for the rigger basically. But yeah.
So I was actually a really big fan of The Division. It took me a few years, but I came to it when the second one came out and actually found that world and that game very compelling and really well done. I thought it was going to be Tom Clancy sort of like Gumpf and then it was actually, I thought it had quite a lot of layers to it and the gunplay was really good and the world was pretty amazing.
So that's one of your credits too, Jamie. What's the story with you working on that?
So yeah, this was at the tail end of the crew. And at the time there wasn't really such a thing as a looter shooter. I mean, it's kind of every other game now seems to have some kind of loot or resource kind of a component in it.
But at that time you had Diablo 3 had just came to the consoles. Destiny was in development and maybe came out during the time of the division and there was no such thing as kind of loot systems on consoles kind of really. And the idea was to bring a realistic kind of shooter, which again is totally different to something like Boardlands.
You know, Boardlands was pretty much the only thing on the market at the time. A high fidelity, realistic shooter in the vein of Call of Duty. Obviously, it's not really like Call of Duty, but that's the idea.
You can squad up, drop in and out, have a fun time, upgrade your weapons and it's kind of future tech. So, you know, pretty much anything goes. And that was basically at the end of the crew.
They said we'd be working with Massive. So that's a pretty Massive at the end of that sentence. Massive, the studio in Sweden.
So they were pretty cool at the time. They were looking to basically make their first console game because they'd never made a console game before that point. And it was a big refresh in that team.
So we got kind of brought on to kind of help out, not only, you know, bringing the project to the fore because a bunch of people had worked on Watch Dogs, you know, another third person Ubisoft game. But, you know, experiencing the gunplay, a lot of the cars in the world, for example, because Driver San Francisco had really good car artists, you know, vehicle artists and, you know, high fidelity, things like that, they got brought on to basically do a lot of the background kind of clutter, you know, the burnt out cars and things like that in the world. So they used the expertise in kind of different ways.
I love the idea of like you've mastered moving cars, now apply that art to just creating all these these fucking busted motors. That's great.
So something I was curious about Jamie, as part of that role, you went over to Massive quite frequently, is that right? So at that point, were you with your role changing? Were you becoming more senior?
What was that like for you?
Yes, by that time I was a game designer. So again, go back to that kind of tier earlier, you've got junior, kind of intermediate and then senior. So at the time I was kind of approaching senior designer and this was to go work on the loot system for the division.
So the kind of the foundation, the core of that system didn't exist before I joined the project. I was involved in that kind of side of it and we had to have regular trips over to Sweden, which is in Malmö, Sweden, which at the time has grown into its own kind of game hub in itself. But massive were a huge kind of building by the river, you know, maybe three, four, 500 people kind of strong and we would be going there to basically go work with their, you know, their progression teams, you know, how the character kind of progresses in the game, their enemy teams, you know, what the enemy behaviors do and how does the AI function and then also their weapon teams as well.
You know, what kind of upgrades are you going to get? What are the unlocks for the weapons? Because all of these things directly tied into the loot system, which is what I was part of.
Super interesting to be designing a game like this in parallel to Destiny as well. I guess Destiny rolled around just over a year before The Division came out. So yeah, that must have been quite the process of figuring that stuff out on the fly.
What's that like when you see something come out which is in the same space that you're working in and has obviously got its own answers to the same challenges you're facing? Like, are you nervous that they've done it better? Or are you excited to see how they've tackled it?
What's the vibe there?
Yeah, I mean, I had a note about this, about development insights of what happens when a competitor is revealed to do something similar to you. Or you're in that kind of vein. It's always difficult because, you know, as a general rule, and this might annoy some designers, is that I don't think there's any original ideas.
Or there's very rarely, as a designer, where you come up with an idea that is completely brand new. So if you're working on a game, and especially a new IP, if you look hard enough, you will find something on Steam that is doing something similar, kind of already. And at that time, you didn't have to look far, because, you know, not 343, the Destiny team, I forgot what they were called.
Bungie, sorry, yeah. So Bungie were basically having this big deal with Activision. You couldn't get away from it.
And that's in the news. But the way I mention that, because we had the same thing on the crew, the crew was in development, and you also had Forza Horizon and Drive Club were roughly coming out at the same time. Three open world, mostly British kind of developers at the time.
And really, it's just about making a meaningful differentiation in your game that would bring people to that. That's one kind of route. Another one is it needs to be immediately satisfying.
So going back to some of the things I said earlier about respecting people's time. People play shooting games like Call of Duty because the gunplay feels good. Some people might bounce off another first person shooter because the gunplay doesn't feel like Call of Duty.
And also Call of Duty is free. So that's another kind of aspect of it as well is you could be competing against a better game and a bigger game that has a different price difference. But the other way to do it, instead of being maybe first to market or being the best, is I like the Gran Turismo kind of analogy.
Just one of my notes I got was you can rapidly kind of iterate your way to the top. So there's only been two division games, but there quite easily could have been maybe five or six in the last several years if the scope was kind of reduced. And the reason I mentioned Gran Turismo is because Gran Turismo 4 to 6, between 2004 to 2013, so they made three Gran Turismo games in nine years.
In roughly the same time frame, Forza Motorsport had five iterations and Forza Horizon, so they did six games in seven years. And you look at how quality and how well established that franchise is now. Whereas they could have looked at that, especially the Forza Horizon team, and said there's a lot of games on the market.
Gran Turismo is dominating the consoles, well, at least on one platform. Why bother? But there's lots of different ways you can kind of go from there.
And with the Division, there was no third-person kind of realistic shooters in that kind of vein. And that was hopefully different enough from Destiny.
Did you enjoy the second one, by the way? I thought the Division 2 was excellent and really built on the bones of what you worked on very nicely. The setting was very different.
But did you enjoy that as a punter?
Exactly, yeah. I mean, a lot of people that I worked with on Division 1 worked on that. And that's almost always the case, at least, is that the iteration or the benefits, the learnings that you get from the first game is always better.
But yeah, as a punter, I think I did pretty much everything the game had to offer barring the DLC. So it's the post-launch stuff when it goes back to New York. That's the only thing I've kind of not scratched the surface of just yet.
From there, Jamie, you worked in education. So what led to that? And then what pulled you back into game design?
Yes, so this was at the tail end of the Division. The game was just about to ship at that point. And there was the opportunity to basically go elsewhere.
You know, part of it was, you know, kind of personal circumstances. I was looking at, you know, buying a house and living arrangements and things like that. I'd been renting for most of the time.
So that was one part of it in terms of location. And another part of it was that at the time they were looking into, especially Ubisoft and local studios, the next kind of generation of talent. Because the thing I forgot to mention earlier was, when I first got a job in games, it was shortly after the financial crash of 2008, which was probably the worst time that you could join games.
At that point, it was extremely difficult to get a job. Fast forward six, seven years later, companies are now more open to, you know, interns, local kind of students, where's the talent pool, you know, who's teaching these kind of people. And when I went back to Teesside University, and I was working for electronic arts at the same time, so I was helping out in the FIFA franchise, you know, to keep a foot in games, basically.
I went back to Teesside, teaching what were effectively contemporary practices, because before that point, there isn't actually many designers that were teaching games, at least at a university kind of standard, because most of those designers were still in the industry. And it was typically, you know, artists that were teaching what they thought maybe was design or their understanding of design. So basically, it was trying to kind of level up that kind of course.
And then as I say, working on FIFA at the same time, you know, kind of remotely.
When it comes to the university lecturers, I guess there's probably an element of it's quite a young industry, right? So not many people have aged out of it as such to move into those kinds of roles. So I can see why something like that would come up as an opportunity.
But I was curious, you mentioned FIFA there. How much as a designer do you have to be a jack of all trades? Because you're talking about, you know, like a shooter here where you're figuring out a loot system.
You're talking about like a racing game where there are practicalities to figure out about how you play online. And then you have football, which is a completely different thing entirely. So to what extent is being a game designer about having like many strings to your bow?
Yeah, I mean, this is always an interesting question because this is also where the AAA maybe versus indie divide comes in. Especially if you're on a smaller scale team, you're probably almost going to be expected to kind of dip your hand into not just aspects of design, but maybe aspects of audio and a bit of animation here and there and things like that. But in AAA, what I'd probably say broadly speaking is certainly at the start of your career, that people are trying to figure out what you kind of enjoy, what you're good at.
Some people make an entire career out of AI design, just designing how enemies behave. And that's the only thing that they'll do for 15, 20, 30 years or wherever it may be. Some people, probably more like myself, I have a general interest in design more broadly.
So I've managed to touch upon different aspects of things. However, the later you kind of get in your career, the more specialized you may want to be. So at the moment, I'm more involved in the more game feel, hands on the pad, gunplay, weaponry, character movements, all of that kind of stuff.
So again, going back to the Mario example, there will be somebody, especially at Nintendo, whose full time job will be to just work on Mario and not do anything else for five years. You know, or Zelda, you know, just work on Link for five years. And that's kind of where I'm kind of moving, I would say in kind of the mid part of my career now, where teams are getting bigger, specialist knowledge is especially in demand.
But I've also got, you know, the jack of all trades, kind of systems design, you know, progression systems, all the things I've mentioned earlier that I'm aware of that can also feed into that as well. Or also, you know, as a softener, if, you know, a role on a certain project needed some experience, but it's not necessarily character focused.
Okay, interesting. So I'm going to combine two of the questions I had in my plan here, Jamie, because I think they are related. But how much do you have to learn about different engines and the way they work as a designer?
And how do you feel about people talking about game engines in public when they have no idea what they're talking about, which seems to be quite a lot. The engines of it all, what's that like as a designer?
Yes. So the one thing that people will never mention about an engine, a game engine in general, is it's basically a tool to kind of get the game working. And it's a tool for basically designers or any other discipline to kind of work within and build the game.
So one thing that people never mention is every single game engine is inherently flawed. And what I mean by that is some game engines are only made to do one thing. And some game engines won't actually do that one thing for a very long time.
So if I talk about Driver, Driver was a proprietary engine. So this was an internal engine. It's not on the market.
It was made internally. That was made for 60 FPS open world games. That was close to 15 years ago now.
I mean, even open world games now on the current consoles are struggling to do that. The offset of that is it's very low fidelity kind of graphics. And that's the inherent kind of flow with our engine.
And also it's made for open world driving games. So if at that time Ubisoft decided to make no more kind of open world driving games, that engine kind of goes on the shelf. And that's the only thing, you know, it kind of sits there for.
The same is true of something like Unreal Engine at the other end. It's probably one of the most broadly used off the shelf engines. The inherent flaw with that is that it's not particularly perfect in any one given area.
You know, it's the engine that does everything, but it's not necessarily perfect at doing something in particular, which means that you have to adapt that engine in some way. And to give you the kind of behind the scenes stuff, I mean, if you look at the Matrix demo that they showed for Unreal Engine quite a while back and the collaboration with The Witcher 4, that is to deal with an inherent flaw in Unreal Engine where it's not necessarily built for super, you know, super detailed, high fidelity open worlds, which is something that Rockstar have been doing for the past 15 years or so. So it's kind of a test case.
It's a proof of concept for kind of showcasing that kind of stuff. So that's why some of these things, you know, come to fruition with, you know, dynamic placement of cars in the world, you know, buildings that can get generated at click of a button. This is the type of stuff that previously would take, you know, months and years for kind of teams to put together.
But in terms of like learning the engines, most of them have a lot of overlap in terms of there is a 3D interface. There are objects that you can drag and drop into the scene. You can move things around.
You can create script logic to make those objects do different things. The nuts and bolts of them are the same, but it's the interface and maybe the scripting language or the coding language behind the scenes is different. And also some of them have their own kind of quirks.
So, you know, I worked on Call of Duty, and on that, that is a very kind of arcane engine where some people have knowledge of that from, you know, 20 years ago that, you know, you would never find out as kind of a punter because it's just locked away in someone's brain. It's not on a confluence page. It's just, you know, somebody is the old wizard.
There's a lot. It's very different. But, like, you know, there was a lot of that in magazines in terms of, you know, this weird bit of...
And we had, like, a bespoke capture device that, like, if it broke, that it would never be made again because the guy who built it, you know, left Future years ago. So it was kind of like, here's hoping this doesn't break or we're never getting a witty screenshot ever again. But I kind of like that.
I like the idea that it, like, is in someone's head. That's pleasing.
Jamie, I suspect that's a lot more common than people realise that knowledge lives with people and not necessarily on a wiki somewhere. Do you think that's true that, like, there are people like that in every studio where the expertise sort of lives and dies with one person sometimes?
Yeah, I mean, it's the danger, though, of having that one person who is the kind of, you know, the crooks of knowledge or, you know, they're the fulcrum of whether the studio is going to be successful or not. I mean, those kind of people would be highly in demand in terms of their expertise, their, you know, high salaries. They could kind of go live anywhere in the world that they wanted to, but at the same time, they're a real risk.
You know, for example, if they go on holiday from work or, you know, they get an illness or something like that. So I think studios now are much more mindful of distributing that knowledge, not only with the documentation, but maybe that person is the head of a, let's say, programmer. That wizard of knowledge, you know, the arcane kind of cookbook that they've got, they're the ones that are trying to share it with their team of programmers.
So they're disseminating the knowledge amongst the team. Because as I say, it's a boon as well as a risk to have people like that.
I don't know if you watched the Psychonauts 2 documentary. But one of the things I thought fascinating about that was when they switched from whatever they were using to Unreal. I think it was the first time they did that was for their virtual reality Psychonauts game.
And just seeing all these sort of old timers, you know, with like manuals on their desks and they're like, well, I guess we've got to figure this fucking thing out. Have you ever had like a moment like that of like, is there a bit of you say that there's a lot of overlap, but is there ever a little bit of like, oh shit, I've got to learn this whole thing, this whole other thing now or, you know, are there enough things in place to kind of guide you through that process?
Yes, sometimes yes and sometimes no. So I can't speak to it too much. But if you think of something like Frostbite, so that's EA's kind of engine.
I think traditionally that wasn't made to do the types of things that it's used for. Now, you know, it's used for driving games.
Right.
It's used for football games and things. And I think originally it was Battlefield. So large scale destruction kind of warfare.
And then imagine somebody says in EA, OK, the next game is going to be in Frostbite. OK, really cool. But your next game is going to be a driving game on track based kind of physics, which has never been done before because they've only used off road kind of vehicles and also it needs a progression system and all of these other things that maybe Battlefield doesn't necessarily have.
I mean, it does have a progression system, but I'm speaking a lot to maybe like Bioware. It doesn't necessarily have the narrative tools to do what they want. And then you're at the forefront of an engine that has lots of experience in the company, but no experience in what it is that you're specifically trying to do with it.
Right.
So, Jamie, at Sumo Digital, you were the lead game designer on Hood, Outlaws and Legends. You mentioned that earlier. What were the challenges and opportunities of working on that one?
Because that does seem on paper more like your sort of thing, maybe, than just based on your recent experience of games.
Yeah, so this came up as a conversation from somebody I used to work with at Ubisoft that they were moving into a design direction position on what was a Hood, Robin Hood kind of style game team versus team, you sneak into the castle and you steal the goods from the enemy basically and the enemy is AI guards and you're contending with those. So when that opportunity came up, Robin Hood is one of three characters that if I could choose to work on a game with any character, Robin Hood would be one of those three. The other two, by the way, is...
Really?
You're a big Robin Hood fan?
Yeah, I'm a huge fan of... It's funny, not just Robin Hood, I like medieval kind of era, but it's funny now. You talk about PlayStation games on previous episodes about every single PlayStation game has a bow and arrow.
I like bow and arrows before they were cool, and now bow and arrows are everywhere. So yeah, when that opportunity came up, that was pretty cool. But the real challenge and the opportunity with that was it was a fairly small team trying to punch above their weight, effectively trying to make a AAA game.
What you might consider AA in a pretty tight timeline on new hardware. So I didn't mention this earlier, but the crew and HUD were two games that were made for next-gen platforms. At the time, I was basically getting hands-on with the DualSense and what the specs of the console would be and how you would use the controller before that stuff had even came out.
So that was pretty cool. But the other challenge is at that time, The Hunger Games was out maybe five or so years before that. You had Lord of the Rings at the turn of the century.
You had the Arrow TV series. You've got Tomb Raider, Horizon and you've got The Last of Us. They are all the big staples for expectations of what a bone arrow needs to be in a game.
We've got a game that has Robin Hood on the cover. You better believe that that bone arrow has to be good. So that was the challenge with the small team.
So yeah, just working on that for pretty much two and a half years, trying to close the gap of satisfaction in terms of what the bone arrow feels like compared to well established competitors.
Wow, yeah, I hadn't really considered that. And that's just one part of the game as well. And there's all these other parts to consider.
What is the king of bone arrows in your opinion?
That's a good question. At that time, Horizon was the king for me. But their bone arrow, to me, used to feel a little Fisher Price in the sense that it felt like it was dumbed down, it was a little bit too easy, it wasn't super hardcore in terms of how it felt to shoot a bow.
So at that time, I would say Horizon. Since, I would probably say Hood is right up there. And I do actually quite like the revised bow on The Last of Us 2, except I think they're throttled back, because as you see on this podcast all the time, they prefer to stab dogs in the face instead.
They prefer the close kills instead of the long range kills in that game.
Wow, okay. So you mentioned Call of Duty. One of the last games you worked on was Call of Duty Vanguard, working on elements of the campaign like ammo, scarcity and a dynamic cover system for the AI, among many other things.
Your LinkedIn page, by the way, is excellent. It really does have lots of granular detail of what you've been up to. It made my research very easy, Jamie.
But how do you plug into the development process of a game with that much scale to it? It sounds like you've already worked on a lot of large-scale projects leading up to this, but what is it like to... You're at Sumo, I guess, and then it's an Activision game, it's one of Activision Studios, it's their own technology.
What's it like being plugged into a process that gigantic from your perspective?
Yes, I mean, part of it was slight intimidation because that team previously was the Dead Space team. So Sledgehammer Games originally formed from, you know, what was the remnants of Visceral Games who worked on Dead Space. So that was pretty intimidating to me because as well as Resident Evil 2, I think Dead Space is the only kind of survival horror that holds a candle to that.
So that was one part of it, you know, putting the Activision large-scale Call of Duty franchise to one side. The other side of it was, it was for me, a bit like a comfy pair of slippers because Ubisoft already had franchises and teams of that kind of scale and those demands. You know, obviously not as big as Call of Duty, but that's the closest thing to kind of a big machine that was going.
But the most surprising stuff is the project itself. This is just for Vanguard. You know, effectively each Call of Duty game is four games in one.
You've got the campaign, you've got the multiplayer, you've got the co-op mode, which is normally zombies, but not always. And you've got Battle Royale. And I was joining the campaign team, which had twice as many people as the entirety of what we had on HUD, just on the campaign.
Yeah, it's pretty crazy in terms of the size of that. So coming into that team, really you just have to come in and be pretty humble about it. In the sense that these are people that have been using an engine for far longer than you have that have been using...
They used to say things on Call of Duty, we don't do it that way, we do it this way. They don't tell you why until you try something out and then you realize you made a mistake. And that's the reason why they do things the way that they have for the past 15 years.
Something really simple like a barrel in a game. The barrel has kind of chamfered edges, so it's almost like smooth kind of edges. So it means you never get stuck on them when you're running through the environment.
They can get really picky with the collision in the game, because anything that kind of snags the player reduces the flow that's in the game. So it's basically just been open to that kind of experience that they've built up over 10, 15 iterations and then basically come in with your own kind of experience, especially in the ammo scarcity side. That's something I did on Hood.
It's something I did on The Division, but it's something that they had never done before because ammo scarcity is not really a thing that existed in Call of Duty. It's just fire as many bullets as possible, so I could bring my experience in that kind of area.
Sure. Does it help coming in without maybe the same tunnel vision that when you've been working on one thing and thinking about that one thing for years and years, you don't necessarily have the same perspective of someone who's kind of been parachuted in to work on it. Does that help at all?
Do you think that perspective?
I think so in some cases. Really, I would just say most people should be kind of open, open to new things or trying different things. But, you know, I've been on some games where teams have maybe working on an open world game for the first time.
And I've worked with people who've worked on open world games, say Assassin's Creed and things, they'll have forgotten more than some people working on an open world game will kind of ever know. And I think some people are so set in their ways that they don't want that kind of outside advice or vice versa. They've got that kind of knowledge, but they're kind of reticent to kind of pass it on to the next person.
You know, going back to the thing earlier I said about the person who's the oracle of kind of knowledge, it can be a risk that kind of way. But coming in externally, they were totally open to that stuff. There is some stuff that I did, a really low level example of some interaction stuff in Call of Duty.
I helped them solve a problem that they'd never been able to solve in the last like 10 versions of Call of Duty. But it's something that we've done on multiple games kind of previously. And it's about when you get to an interaction radius of something, it's normally just a bound.
If you cross the boundary, the interaction prompt pops up. If you walk out of the bound, it disappears. Some games I've worked on have a feathering kind of volume, which means that the prompt stays on screen for longer, so that when you push the button, you always get the interaction.
Whereas sometimes you push the button, you were slightly too late, or sometimes you were too early. That's a problem the game had had for years. Nobody will ever notice that problem, and even me mentioning it now, some people are thinking, what's he talking about?
But that's the type of thing that players will encounter hundreds of times in a game and never realise why it hasn't been solved. So, yeah, I've got to bring something to it.
Amazing. Some truly amazing insight there, Jamie. But now we get to the really important question, which is what are the biggest clangers you've heard on this podcast about either games or the way games are made or someone who actually knows what they're talking about?
So as I said beforehand, I don't think there's many kind of what I would consider kind of clangers, but there's a couple of things I just jotted down from recent episodes. And I say recent ones, the ones I've been listening to recently. So the first one is just about the Halo kind of episode.
There was something that I think you said, Sam, which was, Samuel, that devs should spend a lot of money on FPS campaigns and also make them extremely replayable. And as soon as I heard that, I jotted it down straight away. The reason being is because you actually touched upon something quite important, which is that this is kind of two sides of exactly the same coin.
So if I go back to the Call of Duty example, the campaign of Vanguard or any Call of Duty for that kind of matter is probably one of the most expensive parts of the game relative to the amount of time that you spend in that particular game mode. So I don't know what the money or what the cost would be, but it's a big chunk of money for effectively six to eight hours of somebody's time. And to spend a lot of money on FPS campaigns these days, they would probably be kind of reticent to do that, unless something was going to keep them there for a long time, which touches upon your second point, which is to try and make it as replayable as possible.
Dynamic kind of systems, you have maybe more like rogue-likes. That's one of the reasons why they're so popular recently is you're creating a fixed amount of content, but you can use it in an infinite amount of ways. So that wasn't a clanger, but it was just one of those where I don't think you can do one without the other kind of thing in this case.
Yeah.
I will say, I think that was specific to Halo, where I think that Halo's replayability, the stickiness of those campaigns is exceptional versus a lot of other first-person shooter games, which is why I was making that case.
Double down, double down.
That's what we do on this podcast, we double down on our bullshit. No, that's a fair point. You've got more, though, Jamie, so I'm keen to hear them.
Cool, yes, there's two more. One for Matthew and then I've got the last one is have you both combined because they're dovetailed together. The second one is, I've named it here as Matthew as a creative director.
The cool thing about this one was the 2022 end-of-year predictions, there was debate about the Indiana Jones game. If Indiana Jones is going out of a room, you should stick your hand under the door and have the hat kind of carry, pull the hat back into your inventory or that kind of thing.
Yes, and that game is a 10, correct?
It's a million dollar seller. And then also things like ideas for a lot of suggestions and the hit and hope kind of stuff. Again, not necessarily a clanger, but this stuff does happen, which is somebody walks in a room, says, let's make this happen, and they almost mic drop and kind of walk out again.
It doesn't happen very often, but yeah, I have experienced that kind of in the past. And especially, you know, something so trivial as a hat kind of carry, it's so ingrained to that character, but some people might play that off as, well, our time is better spent kind of elsewhere. On the flip side, somebody can come in a room and say that kind of thing.
And because they're the head kind of handshow of the project, that potentially could be the most important thing that anybody has to work on that particular day.
Right.
Yeah. Interesting.
I've got a big creative director in here.
Matthew has made a five out of ten Indiana Jones game with the most meticulous hat grabbing animation that you could...
But the Nazis have no AI.
Oh, amazing. That's very interesting. Go on, Jamie.
The last one, dovetailing the two together, was both of you speaking from a consumer point of view about a game from Game Pass has to grab me within an hour or less. I'm paraphrasing these, by the way. I don't want to put words in either of your mouths.
And the other one is sometimes you can play enough of a game to see what it has to offer. And I think that was your, Sammy, about Ghost of Tsushima. You said that if you'd have played it for 30 hours and then you played it for 60 hours, you would have rated it exactly the same because of the other 30 hours between.
And I think these two are really interesting point about modern games and especially kind of open world games. I'm much the same, which is from a design point of view, how do you deal with somebody that has 500 games to choose from on Game Pass at any given time, probably isn't going to give an hour's worth of kind of, you know, attention to that. Because on average, I should say, by the way, that most players, average players, play games for 90 minutes per day.
So that's the metric that you're kind of working against is if you've got 90 minutes to keep somebody's attention for the average player, an hour or less. And then also, if they do stick with your game, how many hours does it take before you think you've seen everything that the game has to offer? Because I'm much the same.
I've done the campaign of, sorry, Ghost of Tsushima. I've done the campaign. I haven't 100%ed it, but I feel like I've seen at least one of everything that it's going to show me at this point.
Should I stick with it or should I go have a new, fresh experience? And from a design point of view, that's what you're working against, which is somebody who's going to move on to the next game because you've got repetitive filler content or there's a nice new advert on the Xbox dashboard that's attracting you to the next thing rather than sticking with what you have.
Super interesting. Jamie, did I imagine that you had a Tears of the Kingdom clanger tagged in this document at some point? Maybe you took it out, but something about maybe the creative interface of Tears of the Kingdom, was that in your notes at some point?
Originally was, but I didn't want to start a war between any three of us. Yeah, about what we think of Tears of the Kingdom, but the long story short with that one was just, I think the interaction system, they're gluing things together in Tears of the Kingdom. I think that's not very Nintendo when you think of how much time and effort they put into Mario feeling good and kind of an empty box room for something that you use so frequently in Tears of the Kingdom.
I just think it's a missed opportunity that they could have spent even more time making that user experience of a much lower standard. The only reason I brought it up in this kind of clangers was I don't necessarily want anybody to bat too hard kind of either way for Tears of the Kingdom, but I definitely think that was a misstep in terms of how frequently you use that mechanic relative to how comfortable it feels to use.
Amazing. That's basically what I said and Matthew reviewed it.
Yeah, that's absolute bullshit. Amazing. Sometimes, if you want to move the needle and you want to be ambitious, you've got to take those early baby steps.
Amazing. How much have you engaged with Starfield's settlement system, Matthew, by comparison? Much of that?
No, not at all. It's terrible.
I actually had no idea what your perspective on that one was, Jamie, because I saw it tagged and I thought, does he feel the way Matthew does, that it is intuitive and it is a step forward for the interface of that, or does he feel the way I do, which is that it lacks a bit of Nintendo simplicity?
I don't think it's intuitive. Listen, I know it's not intuitive, but I'd say it's compelling enough that you will go through that learning process.
That's my stance. Well, Jamie, you tried to be diplomatic by taking out the plan, and yet here I am dragging you right back into it.
This is why I didn't bring it up. But yeah, I'm not taking sides either way, but I just think it's not in their MO. But the other thing I was going to touch upon too, which was if they were to do a sequel or they were to do an update, the types of feedback that you would get on those kind of systems would be straight in the firing line for things to be targeted.
Well, surely they got lots of that feedback from user testing before they released the game, right? They had enough time to get that user feedback. Maybe this, to them, felt like the best possible version of what they could offer based on what they had.
I don't know. I guess it's kind of rhetorical, Jamie, but yeah. Okay, so here's a spicy question, but I think it's sort of key to the title of the episode, and it's something I just love hearing about from game developers, because I think there is this gap of knowledge between what the public is allowed to know about game development and what game development is actually like, and that's become more obvious in recent years with reporting from the likes of Jason Schreier, and his books on this are very good as well, but also just more anecdotal feedback being shared on social media about what it's like to work at big studios.
But what do you think is the number one thing that the public and or games journalists don't understand about games and the way they're made?
I've got two, but I will mention kind of the broadest one, which is touching back on what we said earlier about the kind of the low level decision making versus maybe the high level vision of the game. I think one thing that people will never recognize until you watch maybe a GDC talk or you maybe hear a developer discussing their stuff is the amount of micro decisions it takes to help create a micro experience. And I'll give you a really, really basic example.
Again, Resident Evil 2, one of my favorite games, so especially the remake. So that's a survival kind of horror game where you're intending to put the player on the back foot. You're supposed to make it feel like that the player is, you know, disempowered at least on the first kind of couple of run throughs.
So the types of micro decisions they'll make are a lot of people don't notice that in Resident Evil 2 remake, you can walk backwards faster than you can walk forwards, which means that retreat is always an option. It makes no logical sense in real life why you can walk backwards faster than forwards, but that's a decision that's been made to kind of fulfill that experience I mentioned earlier. The slight pause before you shoot the headshot means that you line up the perfect kind of shot, you know, you're taking that extra breath before you shoot.
That increases your chance of getting a critical headshot. Another one is that Leon, and you know, this is the case in Resident Evil 3 as well, they have a shoulder flashlight, so there's a light that's on your shoulder to show where you're going. If the character faces backwards, the light will still face forwards at all times, so you can always see what the camera is looking at, but not necessarily what the character is looking at.
The limited inventory size, the manual collection of infrequent items, the dynamic resource management, so how many times have you played a Resident Evil game where you get to the end of a section, you feel like you're just about to run out of ammo, and then either it gives you an ammo dump, or straight after that boss fight, it kind of refills you again. You know, none of those things are by chance, and I think there is so many of those kind of decisions that get made on a daily basis, including the Indiana Jones kind of hat one, you know, that's a more prominent example, that help contribute towards what the macro of the experience is.
When you're playing these games, are you sort of seeing that stuff more easily? Is it like looking through the matrix? Or where does that stuff come from?
Do you find yourself, like you've got Leon in Resident Evil 2, are you kind of like throwing that character around to try and get a sense of what they've done? Or do you just instinctually know what they're doing?
A bit of both. So for Resident Evil 2, I went through the entire game, had no idea that if you wait slightly longer to shoot them in the head, you'll get a critical headshot. And funny enough, the guy who originally got my job is called Mark Sample.
I was chatting to him in a conversation, and I said to him, it would be really cool if Resident Evil 2 had a thing where if you waited just slightly, it would have a higher chance of getting the headshot or popping the head. And he said, oh no, it does that. And I missed the loading prompt that tells you that information, because the game doesn't really convey that very well.
So that's part of it. But another part of it is the bit about throwing the character around. When I played Horizon Forbidden West, the second Horizon game, I spent the first 40 minutes in the first area doing everything.
Running into the walls, rolling into the walls, rolling to shoot, jumping to shoot, go up to the trees, what does the collision look like, what happens if you jump into the water, what happens if you jump into the water backwards, literally every single thing you can think of and are recorded at all because that footage, especially internally, comes in useful when you're trying to do something similar. But what is it that a premium game is doing? And in terms of animation, they'll call that coverage.
How many different states of animations do you have and how many animations do you have for all of those permutations? So yeah, I do bits of both basically.
Oh, man. Yeah, I'm riveted. It's really, really cool to hear about.
Okay, so I guess the same lines, Jamie, when it comes to sort of like knowledge and understanding of games. Do you think the heavily NDA'd nature of the games industry is a good or bad thing for helping the world understand how the sausage gets made? Are there some things that should be allowed to be forgotten?
Should we know more? What do you think of that whole side of things?
Yeah, I think this is probably the most difficult question of them all in the sense that, you know, obviously there are certain things you can and can't say when you're working in the industry, but I think there always has to be a willingness to share from developers, which is, you know, the kind of early access, the GDC talks, if anybody's not seen those, you know, anything where they're trying to show how the sausage is made, but equally, there has to be a willingness to kind of receive that from the users as well. And you know, the bad news that you see of, you know, the Grand Theft Auto 6 kind of leaks, people look at that and don't understand that that's necessarily a project that's in development. You know, maybe that was two years prior to when the information was kind of gathered.
But if the developers have kind of came out ahead of time and said, here's the current state of the game, I don't know whether that would have been a better scenario or worse scenario than what actually happened kind of regardless, because people want to keep their secrets. They want to surprise people on kind of the release day. And as that thing becomes more and more common, you know, leaks seem to happen every three or four months at kind of this point, that the audience has to be receptive to, well, we're not going to engage with the leaks, or if we see something that's in progress, we're open to the fact that it's not kind of final.
But the flip side to that is, when you do present something to the world, you get something like the Nemesis system from Shadow of War and you get the Ping system from Apex. Two features that, when I said earlier, it's very difficult to come up with a new original idea or something that's going to carry the industry forward. Arguably, I would say that those two features did.
It brought them out into the public domain. One of those features is now behind effectively a license lock that you're not allowed to do something in that kind of vein. The other one, which is the Ping system, is basically being made freely available to everybody to do what they want with it.
If somebody wants to outright clone that feature, they can. So it's a combination of all of those things as to what secrets do you want to share, how is the audience going to receive it, and of the stuff that is in the public domain, how willing are you to allow others to kind of benefit from standing on the shoulders of giants.
Okay, so here's my last spicy question, Jamie, then we'll take a quick break. What do you think about how auteurs and games are discussed by the media and the world at large? Does it tally with how games are actually made?
Yeah, I mean, games are made by, especially in AAA, a huge couple of hundreds, you know, potentially up to a thousand people kind of teams. And to put the success of that game down to maybe one or two people that are on the stage at, you know, Microsoft Conference or the people that are kind of posting on Twitter in high frequency and things like that, it's not ideal in the sense that they're the people that are getting the recognition for it. At the same time, they should because of maybe the successes that they've kind of got from their career.
So it's kind of, you know, it's a cop-out answer, but there's good and bad. I just think that the other side of it is when you see kind of directors in the media are getting portrayed, they're leaving a company, you know, even the example of Jedi Survivor kind of recently, it's already been announced that potentially there's going to be a trilogy to that. The question I would have is, you know, the director of Jedi Survivor, what is the impact that that one person will have on potentially the third game in the trilogy relative to the other 600 people that are within that team?
It's a bit different in Kojima's case because it was Kojima, you know, going from Metal Gear to Death Stranding, but also took a large proportion of his team with him. I'm not too sure if he'd have had the success if it was just him on his own striking it out kind of on his own from scratch. So it's a combination of those two things as to how much influence a given individual kind of has on that franchise and how much benefit the franchise can have, you know, when it does change director.
You know, God of War is another example. The sequel is arguably better than the original one, but, you know, how much difference did Cory Barlog make for the second game versus the first game when, you know, the first game he was, he had the reins?
Yeah, exactly. And, you know, that again, like the Jedi survivor creative director you're referring to is Stig Asmussen, right? So the guy who made God of War 3, which is a favourite of me and Matthew, a problematic fave of me and Matthew.
So, yeah, and then you wonder how much that, how relevant, does that become more or less relevant example with time as team sizes grow because the God of War 3 development situation would have been a very different scenario to Jedi Survivor, right? So, yeah, but again, we have no real way of knowing, but it is interesting to hear your perspective on it. I think that makes a lot of sense.
It's not just about one person. It's maybe about a collective of people in relation to one person. So, yeah.
I was curious, though. I mean, this, you know, maybe this kind of runs counter to that question and what you just said, but, you know, in all the different things you've worked on, have you ever worked under someone who you thought was like, this person's a genius or this person's brilliant and like, they should be better known?
Yeah, I mean, definitely on both sides. I mean, I've worked with fantastic directors, excuse me, fantastic directors, kind of in their own right. It's on the team.
It's on the PR kind of side. It's on the director side to say, hey, you know, we've got a fantastic team. We're doing these things.
We're all a collective as opposed to trying to be somebody that's going to, you know, try and take all the plaudits for yourself.
That's super interesting. Well, that ends our spicy questions, Jamie. Let's take a quick break and we'll come back with some of your development insights.
Welcome back to the podcast. Time for Jamie to teach us some things. This section is called Development Insights.
Jamie, so we can call you Jeremy then. It's definitely a weeknight for me here. All guests are turning into Jeremy Peel for me at this point.
So Jamie, talk us through your little description here of this section and kind of what you're hoping to, I guess, like in parts from your knowledge as a game designer.
Yeah, so the first thing I was just gonna touch upon, and again, it'd be interesting to hear your kind of takes on this, but it's a bunch of questions that if I wasn't a game developer, what I would ask people about how this thing particularly works because it's not always obvious to people. So effectively, I'm Joe Bloggs on the street. How do these things kind of work?
And all I was gonna do is just go through a couple of questions, kind of one at a time. They're pretty broad, but hopefully it'll give people some insight as to how things work. And just a quick caveat again is, this is mostly my experience in AAA.
It's not necessarily the experience of everybody in that case.
Yeah, no worries. How about me and Matthew alternate and asking you the questions you've answered here? Yeah, that's good.
Matthew, do you wanna go first?
Yes, I can do a very convincing impression of an idiot on the street. There's nothing about going to the toilet.
Jamie, what are the common pitfalls when producing a new IP?
Yeah, so this, you know, my other spicy take is that a new IP and AAA is probably the most difficult thing that you can do in AAA game dev. The reason being is because as you'll have heard with people on this podcast before, and any game even releasing is kind of a broad line miracle in terms of there are so many forces that are working against you, you know, money, time, experience, whatever it may be. And when it comes to a new IP, that's almost a false multiplier on all of those things that are working against you.
So you've got, you know, the experience of the team, you've got the track record of the studio, you've got being able to establish a franchise because one thing that people forget is you're not trying to create a game, you're trying to create a franchise, take a look at something like Remnant, I was just playing that earlier actually, Remnant 2's just came out, they probably in mind, they had in mind that they wanted to create a franchise, not a game, and they used to do that at Ubisoft for some titles, which was you wouldn't necessarily put all of your eggs in the basket for the first title, you would kind of lay them out in a row because you knew you wanted to make a trilogy. The first game might be slightly weaker in that case, maybe there's less finances, maybe there's less experience with the team, but the second game will really benefit from that. And you'll see that in the case of Jedi Survivor as well, the kind of the follow on of taking an established franchise but making something kind of new.
Another reason is because when it's a new IP, you're trying to find the fun. You don't even know what the game is. You don't even know why people are gonna play the game at that point.
So you can spend a whole load of time in a test arena or a test environment. So we normally call it a gym, trying to find out what makes Mario tick. That could be six months of your time trying to make a character that's comparable with Mario.
Six months would be a shorter kind of estimate. You could be targeting a certain audience, identifying a niche. I'll just blast through a couple of these.
Ideally, a team needs to recognize their limitations, which is a really good one. If a team has never worked on an open world game before, the team should know at the start of the project, we've never worked on an open world game before. Whereas I've been on some projects previously where, you know, on different projects in different genres, you don't know what you don't know.
When we first worked on a third person kind of open world game like The Division, nobody on that team had worked on that aside from the people who'd worked on Watch Dogs. The people who worked on Watch Dogs hadn't worked on a third person open world game because they'd worked on Driver, which was, you know, fully in a car. Having a big team too early is another good one.
You're trying to create something with maybe a 70, 80 person team when maybe you only need 10 people to kind of find the phone or what the essence of the game is and then slowly but surely kind of bring people on. And there's a whole lot of others, but the exception to the rule of this is, take a look at something like Guerrilla. So Guerrilla Games make the Killzone franchise, which I used to absolutely love, especially Killzone 2.
If somebody said to me that a Sony team is gonna take a boatload of money and they're gonna make what might be considered one of the best kind of open world games of the last maybe 10 years or so, and kick off a whole new franchise, they've never done quests before. They've gone from linear corridors and shooting to an open world and kind of projectile-based behaviors to one enemy, from one enemy type to a whole load of creatures of which not all of them are ground-based. I would say that is probably one of the riskiest things you can do in game development, and yet they massively succeed at kind of do that.
So I see Guerrilla Games as being the exception rather than the rule, because that doesn't happen very often.
Yeah, it's super interesting. As you were talking about that, I was thinking about playground currently transitioning. It will not, you know, I imagine they're still gonna be making Forza games, but you know, the core of the Fable team, having made an open world car game, like, you know, they're both gonna be, we assume, open world games, but like, even that jumps, you know, you would imagine that's gonna be pretty massive.
Exactly. And just as an outsider, that's what you can see with it. But the benefit that they have, you know, Fable is a good example, so is the Star Wars one, which is, of all the things I've mentioned, think of them like sliders.
You can make it harder or easier for yourself. So the Fable team tends to hire people that have RPG experience. So they might not necessarily have that in-house, but they're hiring that kind of in.
But then you have the Jela team and the culture and things, so there's other aspects. But touching upon the Star Wars example is, it's a brand new game, but it's an established franchise. So if you can tie it to something that kind of reduces that force multiplier a little bit, and it's the same as Fable, regardless of the game in the end, it's a franchise that's well-known and well-established that gives them a lot of grace in terms of the audience.
But at the same time, you can also miss trends if a game goes on too long, or maybe the Fortnite kind of style games or extraction shooters. If you start making one now where the popularity is, it's realistically not gonna be coming out for the next three or four years, unless you do an early access or something like that.
Some good examples there, I think Jamie, of the types of developers you're talking about. Are there any other kind of new IP that jump out to you as it's really impressive that they pulled that off? Obviously, Jedi Survivor and Jennifer Noda are a good example.
So at Horizon, I thought Ghost of Shima was actually a good example of this as well. That is a team that has made open world games, but one set like a built up city and it requires a completely set of, different set of disciplines, I imagine, to build one in a vast open world in the way they did. Is there anything else that sort of jumps out to you as good examples of this?
Yeah, I mean, that's a good one as well. The other one that probably jumps out is Naughty Dog making a multiplayer game. And I think that's another one of those where you don't know what you don't know.
Because as far as I can remember, the last multiplayer game they'll have done, which will have been maybe The Last of Us Survivors mode or Uncharted, you know, one or the other, whichever one kind of came first. So that's the best part of six, seven, eight years where they'll basically be doing high fidelity campaigns, controlling player behaviors, interactions, lots of dialogue. How does that now transition into a game where people are gonna spam the jump button and, you know, grief each other kind of all of the time?
You know, there's a whole load of pain that's coming their way at some point.
But what a bow though.
Yeah, but the bow's good. As long as the bow transitions over, fine, that'll be perfect.
Okay, so next question. Why do games take so long to make?
Yeah, so that kind of dovetails from the last couple of things we mentioned is, you know, finding the fun. A really big one is producing content. So when we talk about content, predominantly chatting about art and kind of animations, you'll see, especially Tears of the Kingdom, you know, the topical one we've just been chatting about, there is a reason why Nintendo placed the game in, for the most part, the same world.
I mean, obviously there's new additions. I won't spoil those in case anybody still hasn't played, but the world is mostly the same because to build an entire open world from scratch, again, would probably take them even longer. You know, you'd still be waiting for the game until probably the new Switch comes out or even longer.
That's also one of the other reasons why in things like Warzone, you know, you've got the DMZ mode now in Call of Duty, they're reusing the same map because it takes so long to create the arts, to create the environments. When Fortnite changes their map, that is a whole, you know, kind of season. It's a big kind of update.
It's a big event. It just takes so long to create this kind of stuff, generally speaking. So that's just on the content side.
But you've also got the personnel on the team. Like you mentioned with Abel, you've got somebody who maybe has RPG experience, but is now new to the team and needs to get up to the processes of Microsoft and familiarity with teammates, you know, because that's another kind of aspect. You get the tool sets.
So again, we've chatted about game engines, so learning those kinds of tools. Again, there's a whole bunch of others, but the other thing that does happen, more often than not, is high-profile changes can happen in a project that happens more often than is presented in the media. So going back to that, you know, a director kind of changes from Jedi Survivor, for example, or you get like an Amy Hennig at Naughty Dog and with the Star Wars game.
Those are the really high-profile, top tier developers that are announced in the media. And that seems like maybe that happens once a year or maybe a couple of times a year. Behind the scenes, that probably happens more often than people think.
And that can knock a project back multiple months because a new director comes in, they have a different take, maybe they have to redo some work that's taken the team six months to do. There's a whole bunch of other things. And then the final one, just broadly speaking, is just polish.
So people say the Pareto principle, 80-20, so you'll spend 80% of your effort in the final 20% of the game because that's the 20% that will carry you maybe three, four, five Metacritic points kind of up. And by polish, we're chatting about not just bug fixing, but appreciation for the overlooked kind of aspects of the game, the types of things that people will just run past. But the one person in a thousand that interacts with it, somebody has handcrafted that particular experience.
I think in Tears of the Kingdom, if you stand in a certain place at a certain time of the day and you chat to somebody, you get a different dialogue option than if you chatted them at night, for example. So somebody has had to kind of make that difference or that distinction, and that doesn't come for free.
Oh yeah. Yeah, you see stuff like the, if the sun's behind you, there's a specific dialogue thing of like, oh, you'd be able to see it if the sun wasn't in the way, and you're like, that would only ever happen if the sun was specifically there. Like, that's crazy.
I had a sort of sub question on this. I was interested, like, what's the longest you've worked on an individual game, and like how people deal with the fatigue, like internally of working for something for so long. Like, how do you remain interested in a thing?
Yeah, so this is, I didn't have that down, but that's a really good question. So the longest project is two and a half years from start to finish, which anybody listening to this, especially in AAA, will say that's extremely short, you know, generally speaking. Yeah, because for Driver, Driver I think was maybe a four, five, six year project, but I was there for the final 18 months.
The division was maybe, probably the division was about the same, maybe two and a half or three years. The crew was about two years. Hood, again, was two years, two and a half years.
Call of Duty, I came on during production, so again, it was more like Driver. It was kind of helping the game along, so maybe 18 months or so. Now, most games realistically, or I should say, FIFA's a yearly franchise, so, you know, for less than one year, but most projects realistically now, on the short end, will be four years.
And, you know, I've pretty much moved jobs every four years, pretty much. So typically, you come to the end of a project, that's the time when a lot of people kind of exit the studio or they look for something new. And especially if you've been on a game for three, four, five, six, seven years, that's definitely the time to either change or at the very least to kind of consider your options because, you know, when it turns into seven years, it could be 10 years, when it turns into 12 years, it might never ever see the light of day.
And you've spent 10 years on something that somebody never sees.
Do you think that that makes the way that we, that people talk about companies and games slightly redundant, Jamie? Like, do we, because we know so little about the makeup of the personnel, does it make sense to, for one game developer's name to have so much baggage attached to it? Or is it, does it just never tell the full story when you talk about games in that way?
Probably both. You know, you mentioned, you know, some of the behind-the-scenes Jason Schreier stuff is, you won't really hear that stuff until somebody does like an investigation or, you know, somebody spills the beans or whatever. But the one, the one that always gets people, and it's a saying we've had in the past is, I mean, obviously E3 doesn't exist, at least in the current form, but people used to say, never go to E3 three times.
If you go there once, you kind of showcase the game. If you go there twice, that's about the time where you need to be announcing the release date. If you're there the third time, the game probably should be on the shelf at that point.
And the general rule of thumb is, if you're at a conference kind of three times or more, you could probably suggest that there's either something behind the scenes that's either wrong with the project, or the project is just taking longer than people might expect and you're best probably not showing it. You know, that's a classic example for Elder Scrolls 6. It's my most wanted game.
They showed it two or three years ago just as a quick teaser. Realistically, it's not going to see the light of day for maybe four or five years more. They probably could have just held it off for another few more years, because every time that it comes to E3, the expectation, well, whatever the game shows, if the summer is now, the people's expectation is going to keep going up and the pressure on the team rises and then things go wrong in development and then it becomes a vicious kind of cycle at that point.
Matthew, the next question is yours, my friend.
Yes.
How do you address an undesirable aspect of a franchise?
Yeah, so this is where I was going to bring up the Tears of the Kingdom stuff, but I'll touch upon a slightly different example. So a lot of years ago, we used to work on our helping out in the Assassin's Creed franchise, and especially at Ubisoft, you used to see behind the scenes lots of kind of details about projects, post-mortems, best practice advice for open world games and things like that. And one of the things that we used to do is they used the map, and this is where it comes in to kind of both of your realm, is they would take reviews and all of the feedback that they would get from online, videos and journals and things like that.
They would put it all on a graph, and at the left-hand side of the graph would be hated. And on the right-hand side of the graph would be loved. So this is specifically talking about features.
So features that you love and hate in a game. And then on the other axis, in the vertical axis, was if something was mentioned not very often, or it was mentioned a lot. So what you really wanted was, you wanted features that people loved, and that they were mentioned all of the time, kind of consistently.
What you didn't want was a feature that was mentioned all of the time, but everybody hates. And that comes back to the Zelda example, with the breakage kind of stuff, that generally speaking, I don't mind it, but there's a lot of noise from people about not liking that feature. So first off, you've got to identify what those features are.
But coming back to Assassin's Creed, one feature that they loved, this was around the time of Black Flag, was the boats. So pretty much most of the Assassin's Creed games since have had some kind of boats in them because they were loved. A hated part of the game was the escort missions.
So any mission where you had to stay by, some kind of AI and guide them to a goal or something. So eventually that feature disappeared from kind of Ubisoft games and other companies will probably do something similar. The curious one is, what happens if you have a feature that's polarizing and this is where Desmond kind of comes in from the narrative, if you have something in the game that's a 50-50, 50% of the audience like The Matrix kind of stuff and 50% of the audience don't like it, the problem you've got there is you will piss off 50% of the audience regardless of which decision you kind of make.
So they used to just say, leave it in the game and it's skippable for the most part. So that's the way that you use to approach it. If it's undesirable, those are your kind of options typically.
Just a big skip, Desmond.
Exactly.
I've got a question about this actually, Jamie. So what do you think, so are escort missions dead, do you think? Have they been sort of soft replaced by these AI companion missions?
A bit like how the Luis stuff works in Resi 4 Remake where you are with a companion and there's maybe some kind of soft objective to keep them alive, but really it's about you and this other character. Maybe you're facing more enemies because you have combined firepower. It's more of like a hangout mission than an escort mission.
What do you think happened there to the escort mission generally?
It depends because I would probably guess on Overwatch, the escort and the objective is probably pretty popular. So in a multiplayer mode, I think that's pretty interesting. The Resident Evil 1, I think the problem always starts with how much interaction does the player have to have with the escorted person or object?
And then the other side of that is in how many situations or circumstances does that thing get in your way of enjoying the experience? And I like the Resident Evil example you mentioned, I forgot about that one, but that is somebody goes to do an interaction and you just leave them. You just leave them alone and you just do your own thing.
You just shoot the enemies and make sure that they don't get caught. But you don't have to drag them to the interaction you don't have to pick them up off the ground whilst they're in the interaction. In a lot of the cases, typically I think it's just about how often do you have to kind of handhold them is what it comes down to.
Wow, that's great. The graph thing is super interesting. And I think they have found some good ways to deal with the Desmond stuff over time.
So good for them.
I'm curious, I mean, maybe you can't talk to this, I don't know, but I'd be curious about like things which aren't loved or hated, but are just kind of like tolerated. And whether it, cause you know, there are a lot of features that you see across Ubisoft games, which in anecdotally, there seems to be a lot of fatigue around, you know, like the belt out, climbing up a tall thing to scan a map, which then fills with icons and like, but they persist. So, but I've never really seen anyone kind of come out saying they sort of love them.
I wonder if people just sort of think they're fine and things which are just fine, you just go, well, we'll just keep hold of that, you know.
Yeah, in fact, I'm glad you asked this because I was thinking that, you know, as I was writing some of the questions and coming up with some stuff. So there's a concept called the Kano method.
This isn't named after Kano from Mortal Kombat.
No, unfortunately not. It's not named after the rapper either, but no, it's a method that they use in basically building cars and it's about features that you need to make things work. So just to give you a basic example, 20 or 30 years ago, electric windows on a car were like the thing, you know, that was the fancy kind of bells and whistles if you had a fancy car.
Now it's one of those that people just take for granted that you've got electric windows on a car, but also the whole purpose of a car is to get you from A to B, but nobody ever gets in a car and says, hey, that was really good A to B, or that was really good electric windows. You just take that stuff for granted.
I do because I'm weird.
Exactly. But nowadays it would be more like, you know, heated seats or, you know, electric kind of displays and things like that. It's the same thing when it comes to features in a game, which is if you don't, if you took something out that was so essential to the game that people don't even realize it, you never mention it until it's not there kind of thing.
And there's so many things in games that are like that, which are, you're probably best leaving it there because it's the foundation, or you only take it out if it's to the detriment of everything else. So if there was lots of filler content that people aren't really mentioning, actually people might be using that filler content as a way to avoid the best stuff in the game or vice versa. So you probably want to reduce the amount of filler content.
And also if you want to improve the filler content, going back to the stuff we touched upon earlier, that's extremely expensive depending on how wide reaching it is. But generally speaking, if it's not really mentioned, probably just leave it alone until it kind of bubbles up to the surface in some way.
It's really interesting. Cause I don't know if necessarily, I would say that maybe of all the major genres, that it feels like the open world games have evolved the least in the last few years. And you mentioned Jamie, that you have a bit of fatigue with this.
And I do as well. But I think that a lot of the same principles established with GTA 3 and Assassin's Creed in 2007 have stuck and that hasn't massively changed. Is there also an element of, we don't exactly know how to solve this problem, but we know this works because the player understands how it works and it's a way that we can lead them through this game.
Is there like that kind of like hard practical element to it as well?
Yeah, I mean, the classic example of that is why every single game has towers. I mean, it includes Zelda as well, which is that's effectively a Disney principle about what they're called weenies or referred to as weenies. You go to a theme park and you can always see the magical castle in the center of the theme park.
It always attracts people eye. It always takes them to where they wanna be. It's for orientation.
That is from something that's probably at this point close to 100 years old. It made its way into games and has now become a staple. If you had a Zelda game or Assassin's Creed or wherever else it may be, and you took all of those towers out, I think the player would have a difficult time orienting or seeing what their next objective can be.
So some of it is fear of the unknown. What would a Zelda game look like if they took all of the towers out? So that's one part of it.
And then the other part of it is, if you did take them out, what do we put in its place? Because the towers are there for, as I said, orientation. If you take them out, how do you solve the orientation kind of part?
You know, you're no longer following the trend of towers, but now you have to solve the problem of how does a player get from A to B, or how do they see their next kind of objective or next piece of gameplay?
What about a magical bird that tells you where to go?
Job done.
Well, Assassin's Creed has one of those too. So, okay, Matthew, the next question is yours.
What happens on the road to release?
Yeah, so this one, and we're at the perfect time of year to kind of talk about this stuff, which is sometimes on people's Twitter accounts, or you see it on Eurogamer or something, that a game has gone gold. And a lot of people probably see that as the outward-facing, the game is ready to ship. Going gold refers to the old kind of gold master disks that they used to burn the final version of the game on to before they'd send it off for submission.
But these days, it's effectively just an online upload that you send a package to a server. But when you're chatting about the road to release, what a lot of people don't realize is that a game is probably done at least maybe six to eight weeks before it's actually on the shelf, in terms of when it's finished. The going gold is just more of a PR kind of thing that the company likes to do to present that.
But the question there becomes, well, what happens to a team during that six to eight week kind of period before a game is kind of coming out? And there's a whole bunch of stuff that probably never gets mentioned, which is you've got compliance. So all of the different platforms have their own rules for how to actually get your games onto them.
So you're working towards kind of all of those checklists. It might be something as simple as trophies and achievements kind of unlocking to framerate kind of issues in the game that you have to resolve. It might be that it has to work on a PS4 original, as well as a PS4 Pro, as well as a PS5 and kind of so on.
So all of the different hardwares. The other one that a lot of people never mention is what's called on PlayStation Play Go. And I think on Xbox now it's got a slightly different name, but it's called Fast Start, which is when you put a disc in the drive or when you purchase a game, it installs the first chunk of the game as quickly as possible so that you can get up and running.
So if anybody's played Xbox and they've seen that, it says ready to start. And then you look at the progression bar and it's only done 10% of the download or something. So that's something that you probably need to think about earlier in development.
But the reason for that is they want to get you in the game as quickly as possible. So normally games will portion off a small part of their entire game. Try keep you playing that experience maybe for 30 minutes or so, depending on your download speed.
And then in that time, the rest of the game is downloaded. So to give some examples, in FIFA, they put you in an arena, one stadium, two teams, and you play a game, maybe you can have a rematch. There's 30 minutes, in that 30 minutes, the rest of the game is kind of downloaded in the background.
So it's a very portioned off kind of area of the game. The Division did the same, you get the first island, which is a tutorial. The crew also did the same, it's a walled off version of Detroit, you can't go elsewhere.
And if Nintendo, for example, were to ever put Breath of the Wild on a different device, think of it as the great plateau is the initial portion of the game that you would install. And in the background, the rest of the world would be kind of downloading, so they want to get you in the experience as quickly as possible. So it's that kind of stuff, you know, setting up.
But also, there's other things like the day one patch or what's called the kind of title updates that some people, especially when they're playing open beta of a game, think that, especially if it's maybe six weeks before launch, all of their feedback that they have maybe about the weapons in Call of Duty is going to make it into the game tomorrow. And the reality is it might be lucky if it makes it into the day one title updates because the game is off of submission. They can't physically change the game anymore because the discs are going to get burned.
But the first day download, that's the day where all of the new content appears in the game or maybe the updates to the weapons or the characters or wherever else it may be. But yeah, there's just a whole bunch of stuff that happens in the six to eight weeks before launch. So for example, when I said this time of year, we're in late September now, any game that's coming out kind of in November is probably done around this point, about now.
And they're on the road to release, which is all the stuff I've just mentioned.
I have one very quick question to squeeze in. And this just calls back to something you said way, way about like a junior role, something that they might do. And you mentioned they might work on achievements.
How do you make an achievement in a game? How do they actually know that they've like popped and things like the actual kind of the thinking behind that? Is that difficult?
Or is that really dumb?
Normally, it's interesting. Normally, it's basically just an additional layer of code on the game that's tracking, let's say stats. So if it's kill 50 enemies, they have their own kind of counter behind the scenes, but that can be more involved.
I remember we did one on Drive a years ago. You've got that street in San Francisco called Lombard Street. It's like a snake kind of shape.
That street, I come up with an achievement which is called Lombard Streak. You had to get from the top of the road to the bottom of the road as quickly as possible. The real challenge, though, is that if you use the fastest car in the game, it actually makes it harder because it doesn't handle very well around that particular terrain.
But for that achievement, we had to place physical markers in the game to say where the start and finish point was, and we start an invisible timer behind the scenes. As long as you go through those two invisible markers within the timeframe, the achievement pops. But that's basically how it works in most games.
And ideally you have a nice pun to go with it there, Jamie, as well.
Exactly.
That makes it good.
I love the last three.
Okay, so next section, Design Challenges. Jamie, do you want to explain the ethos behind this section?
Yes, I'll put this together, again, time permitting, but the idea was, is these are the types of things that designers will kind of come across, and I've touched upon some of these kind of already, but they're split into what I consider kind of two types. So there's common design problems, which are things that almost every single game has to solve in maybe one way or another, depending on the genre, or types of things that you'll come across kind of frequently throughout your career or at least 1.3 career. And the other one is cursed design problems, where these are things that people don't take on the challenge of too much for various reasons, or if you do manage to solve that particular problem, you have the opportunity to maybe set a new norm or a new standard in the industry.
So common and cursed is kind of the way I've framed these. And I just had a couple of questions just for discussion point more than anything else, and maybe even what your thoughts were on these things as well.
Okay, sure. Yeah, common and cursed is basically how our episodes break down as well. Like there's only those 2 versions.
So yeah, okay. So yeah, so common design problems and design challenges that you'll typically encounter at least once that they're typically conventional, well worn approaches to take. So I'll take this first question Matthew, how to make a satisfying weapon?
Yes, so this one, especially when it comes to something like Call of Duty, we touched upon a bow and arrow kind of earlier. One thing that people don't mention is how often players miss in a game. People always talk about how good it feels to get a headshot, but it's good accuracy in something like Call of Duty is 26%.
So that means a player is going to miss three of every four of their shots. Therefore, you better be damn sure that those three or four shots that you miss feel good. It feels good in Call of Duty to shoot the ground because of the weight of the weapon, the haptics, the camera shake.
They added something in, I think, the latest Call of Duty, World of Warfare 2 from last year. Every time you shoot, there is a white flash on the screen and it simulates kind of the flash that you would get from the end of the gun, kind of from the muzzle. And ultimately, it's just pushing that kind of stuff, which we consider kind of signs and feedback as far as possible.
And specifically, not only how good it feels good to hit something but miss, because that's what players do most often. And especially in a bow and arrow game, you might have limited kind of ammo. You want to make sure as much as possible that the player is going to land that final shot.
So there's lots of kind of helpers behind the scenes to home arrows towards somebody's headshot or you just missed but the game counts it as a hit. There's lots of little things like that that people do.
So it's not just about how it sounds, how it looks. It's, yeah, there's other behind the scenes elements that are informing that. That's super interesting.
What do you think is the hardest gun to make good? Kind of gun. You know, there's broad categories of guns.
Yeah, like shotguns, pistols, et cetera.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, if I flip the question round slightly, which is how do you know that you're gonna make good guns in a game and which one to start with? Every day of the week, it's a shotgun.
A shotgun, I've worked on so many games where, oh, this is the typical thing that happens. Most people start with an assault rifle because it's the all range kind of weapon. And even in the division, why would you bother with any other weapon in the game when the assault rifle is the jack of all trades in all kinds of situations?
But a shotgun is close and personal. You need the hit reactions. You need the heft of kind of the recoil.
It needs to feel like it's done significant kind of damage. It potentially takes the enemy off their feet. It potentially has shotgun specific hit reactions.
So they're hit reactions that will only play if you use the hit reaction. You get the close range kind of impacts and maybe some blood kind of spatters onto the camera or something like that. So if you can sell a shotgun really well, then I have a lot of confidence in all of the other weapons in the game.
And second, after a shotgun would be a sniper because it's the complete opposite end of the spectrum. So that's where I would always start is the close range weapon, make it good. And then the far range weapon, make that good and then do in between.
Wow, that's a great answer. Matthew, this next question is yours.
How do you address grouping up with other players if there is a progression mismatch?
Yeah, so this is a common one that people always forget about is between the three of us, one of us has played the game for five hours, one of us has played the game for 50 hours and one of us has played the game for five minutes. How do we group up together and make that feel good for everybody and that you're not dragging people back? There's lots of different ways to do this.
I've saw some games that skip tutorials entirely to get you into a squad. It's something that frustrates me is if we wanna play together and the game says you've got to complete a 20 minute tutorial first before you can join, that's super frustrating. I've worked on some games where they say, let's just assume that the people you're joining are friends and your friends are gonna teach you how to play the game in the moment.
So that's a valid kind of option with that. Dark Souls does passwords, which I really like. So you can play multiplayer with people and you give people a specific password and then I can join a high level players game.
They can help me through the experience. And then that way, it doesn't matter about my mismatch of skill, I'm with somebody that I actively want them to help me because they have an end game weapon or they have far more experience with the game. But then you can also do subtle stuff.
I think it might be Borderlands or something else recently, maybe Gears of War, they do damage adjustments. So I deal the same amount of damage against an enemy and you deal the same amount of damage against an enemy that you would normally do. But for me, it takes more bullets or for you, it takes less bullets or wherever it may be.
So even though we're playing in the same game, the enemy's health doesn't change, just our amount of damage to the enemy kind of changes. So therefore you don't get one person who's kind of trouncing enemies, killing them left or right in center. But yeah, it's just managing kind of damage.
But there's a couple of different ways to go about that kind of stuff.
This next one is interesting. How to approach resource scarcity, something you've done quite a lot of work with.
Yeah. So I think the real difficulty with this one is, is that a lot of people, when they think of ammo in games, let's just say for a weapon, it's really easy. You take the number that's in the weapon, and then you just remove that number from the inventory.
And as long as you have ammo there, the gun kind of refills. The problem starts to become is, what happens if you have a limited amount of clips, or you can swap weapons? And by that I mean, imagine you have an assault rifle, you've got 20 bullets, and you drop the assault rifle on the ground.
Do those 20 bullets go with the assault rifle, or do they stay in your inventory? What if your inventory is already full, and you can't pick up more ammo off the ground? If you kill an enemy, and they drop a weapon, how much ammo does that weapon have?
If you kill a whole load of enemies in the environment, and don't pick up their ammo, how much ammo is kind of left scattered around on the ground? And how many interactions do you have to take? And what happens if you kill five enemies right next to each other?
And this is a pain point I have from Dead Island, is you kill five enemies, and they all drop five items, and they all give one bullet, two bullets, and you have to interact five times in a row while staring at the ground. And we've done stuff previously where we start to clump kind of interactions together, so the player performs one interaction, but you gain the benefits of everything within a localized space. We've also managed things like how much ammo is in the environment directly factors into your accuracy.
Imagine that you were a player that just fired off shots willy-nilly. You just didn't care about if you landed them or not, because the system is dynamically going to give you that ammo back, much like Resident Evil does. You kill an enemy with two bullets, they'll give you four back or something to that kind of effect.
But imagine a player that is completely inaccurate, allows all of those enemies to just scatter tons of bullets in the environment, their accuracy no longer matters because they know that they're going to get the ammo system to kind of feed them back, you know, those bullets anyway. So, you know, you can kind of game the system in some cases. So it's kind of managing what the player has in their inventory and their accuracy and also what's in the environment to make sure that you're not overcompensating for players' poor skill.
Is there like received wisdom around that? Is it so different on a game to game basis that you're basically having to solve this problem anew? Or have you found that the industry is sort of, you know, agreed on a couple of kind of core principles of this?
Like, how do things happen with regards to that?
Yeah, so scarcity in this case, I would say, is a spectrum of, you know, Call of Duty, where normally you don't really care about ammo to the last of us, where every bullet kind of matters. So that's, you know, it's kind of like, where do you sit on that kind of spectrum, first and foremost? The second part is, in terms of received wisdom, you know, if I was to go a little bit harder on Dead Island 2, Dead Island 2 feels like, at least in the ammo resource kind of management, again, that's almost two generations out of date, in the sense that staring at the ground and spamming the Interaction Button is something that we left behind at the Division.
And at the Division, you could collect multiple sets of ammo that would dynamically cater to what the player needed. You didn't need to stare at the ground because the UI comes up to the horizon of the player. So the player doesn't have to tilt the camera down, the UI comes up to the horizon of the player.
And the biggest kind of compliment for that was is that that kind of stuff started to appear in Call of Duty. So bear in mind that the Division is a third-person game. But those kind of features started to appear in Call of Duty as well.
And when you're playing, even things like Borderlands has kind of improved it since. But it's just there is received wisdom out there. I think it's just a case of whether people are taking that wisdom on.
And in that particular case, they probably haven't.
Can you remember the last time you played a game that you didn't work on where you felt like, holy shit, that's a great solution?
Oh, that's a really good question that probably don't have an answer kind of off the cuff.
Right, right.
I guess the ping in Apex Legends is kind of that, Jamie.
Yeah, ping is a good one. The funny thing about the ping was is that around that time when we were working on Hood, we used to have silent play tests, which were everybody goes in a play test, but nobody speaks. And we didn't have a communication system in the game.
And it was roughly about that same week or that same time that Apex was announced and everybody said, oh, they've got this really cool ping system. And basically we just said, okay, we'll just try and, you know, leech as much of that as kind of as possible, because at the time that was the standard. And that's the other thing about design as well is it's almost like Magpie design in some cases.
You just take from other games, take from the best. You know, if you're going to make a platformer, why would you think you're going to make something better than Mario? Try and get a fraction of the way to Mario kind of first, because, you know, the amount of wisdom and kind of knowledge that Nintendo will have, if you got 60% of the way there, you've done pretty well, you know, kind of thing.
Again, I'm really appreciating the Mario references here. Really speaking to you on my level, Jamie, so I appreciate it. Matthew, would you like to take this next question?
Yes. How do you deal with something considered underpowered or overpowered?
Yes. Again, all of these are common problems. The easy answer for this is if it's overpowered, just leave it alone.
Generally speaking, you'll get so many people kind of online. You know, Mortal Kombat's just released recently. You've got Street Fighter.
We'll complain about a character being too overpowered. That is until somebody finds out what the kryptonite for that particular play style is or somebody abuses it kind of too much. The flip side, though, is if something's underpowered, people tend to buff it or improve it beyond what it should be, you know, relatively speaking, to the point of where people start to use it.
So if something's underpowered, bump it up to the point where people are exclusively going to use that thing in particular. And you might also find that that might balance out the rest of the game. But a classic example of this is in one game, I think this was Mortal Kombat from years ago, and they started to nerf a whole bunch of characters in the game.
And much to that thing you asked earlier about, you know, something that wasn't really mentioned, one of the characters in Mortal Kombat, he slowly but surely got small incremental buffs. Instead of one giant buff, he got small incremental ones. And because all of these overpowered characters got nerfed, and they were really poor and people were complaining about them, this character that could slowly but surely kind of improved ended up being the de facto best character in the entire game by secret, because nobody ever realized that that stuff happened.
And it's the same in Overwatch. The first week of Overwatch, everybody's complaining about the robot. Is it Bastion?
I think it is. Until they found out what the harsh kryptonite that was. If they'd have followed what the community had said, they would have nerfed that character, removed his damage, his fire rate, wherever it may be.
Instead, they just waited for the community to recognize what the kryptonite for that thing was. The approach for this is sometimes doing nothing is also a good option. I think Capcom have already announced that for Street Fighter, they are not going to change the balance of any of the characters in Street Fighter VI for the next year or so.
That is also a valid kind of approach to this as well, which is let the community decide after a prolonged amount of time. Also, we are communicating that to them. We are going to leave it alone for 12 months, so please don't complain.
It is really interesting actually because there is an ability in Destiny called Well of Radiance that I think for years and years has basically, what it does is it creates like a kind of AOE healing effect. When you are doing some of the tougher raids, you just get a load of players stand in it and basically shoot at something. It just keeps everyone alive and super useful.
It is basically essential. I don't think any of the raids are finished, we would have actually got there without it. But three weeks ago, I saw there were stories popping up.
They were looking at nerfing it. But for years and years, that seems to have stood as something overpowered. But I guess it was probably quietly decided within Bungie that it's better for the game to keep it as it was than mess with it, which maybe speaks to your point there, Jamie.
Do you also think about behaviors in a similar sense? Like if someone has a cheesy tactic that works. Like in a lot of stealth games, you can find a trick that works.
If you're just patient and you repeat it, you can kind of like one by one remove guards or whatever. That's technically kind of overpowered in that it lets you maybe kind of get around the problem. Do designers, do you think about those kind of behaviors in the same way that you might think about like an overpowered move or an overpowered weapon?
Yeah, definitely. I mean, the few examples I've got for this is that that seems to be how in Overwatch they target specific play styles by introducing a new character that counteracts, you know, maybe what the meta is or, you know, the abusive kind of sneaking up on people tactic or wherever else it may be. So that's one way.
The thing that always bugs me in games, you mentioned about the stealth example in Horizon, the DLC did this for Bidding West. So the stealth one is in Batman, you could run through the entire game of the original with the X-Ray mode on. And then in the second game, they actively introduced an enemy that kind of counteracts that behavior.
So you have to kind of think more on your feet and, you know, you're not always reliant on that thing. So I'm a big fan of that kind of stuff, but I'm not a big fan of kind of brute forcing it. And I think that's how it feels with Horizon for Bidding West where the end of the game, spoiler alert, is that, you know, there's a pterodactyl.
You can fly it all around the world. You can get all these nice vistas. It feels really good.
The first thing that they do in the DLC is they slam the brakes on and say, please stop using that thing that you got at the end of the game. And that's a really, to me, it's more of a ham-fisted way of kind of curbing player behavior. But in that particular case, somebody might have sank 20 hours into the game to get this mount that allows them to cross the world much faster.
And then the DLC, you know, puts a red light on that straight away, which is not great.
Okay, so we come to the cursed design problem section here, Jamie. So design challenges typically lead to innovation or exploration of unforeseen possibilities. There is not necessarily a consensus on how best to approach them.
These are really, really fun questions here. So Matthew, do you want to kick us off? Yeah.
How do you solve a problem like Superman?
So, you know, I was interested here what your kind of thoughts, you know, both of you have played games that have featured Superman or any kind of overpowered character. And the quick caveat with this is when you think of something like the Mandalorian, it's a guy who travels around the galaxy, kind of, you know, he gets a companion, he grows his armor, he gets a bigger army, he visits new places and stuff. That's a classic kind of hero's journey, you know, in games and it's perfectly suited for games.
Superman, he can fly. His ability is that he's physically invincible, so he can't be killed. He's got laser eyes.
He's got super strength. He can freeze people. You know, basically he is anti game design.
I'm just wondering, you know, I've got a few notes here myself, but what your thoughts are as to how that kind of approach is taken.
Can I go first, Matthew?
Oh, you go first, yeah, your problem.
Okay, so I've got a few thoughts on this. So Lego Batman 2 had its own way of dealing with this, which I think is one solution, which is you have Superman as just one character as part of a team, and you have only some sections where you play as Superman, and you get to experience that power differential in little bursts. And it's exciting, and it kind of punctuates other moments of the game.
So that's one thing you can do. You can do a cop-out scenario where basically Superman has some kind of kryptonite condition throughout the game, where maybe he is very slowly accumulating power as he heals from this condition, and then you end with the big moment of Superman has his full power set back, and you get to enjoy those powers in, I guess, a low-stakes post-game situation where you can just beat up enemies, fly across the environment super quickly, that sort of thing. But those are pretty much my only two real thoughts on it.
But Matthew, what about you?
Yeah, not an example that's been done, I don't think. But I think with Superman, you have to think about his value system. And actually, what concerns an invincible man isn't what happens to him, it's what happens to people in the world.
It's what happens to people who you're rescuing. I would say a good Superman game, in the same way of a good Superman set piece in the films, would probably revolve around problem-solving and saving people. And loss of life is the fail state.
That's interesting.
More than the satisfaction of fighting. Like a combat game, you'd always have to apply either bogus conditions to Superman or an army of kryptonite robots, which I think is pretty much what people have done in the past for Superman games. But at the same time, I can't really imagine a rescuing game with not feeling quite like almost like edutainment or a bit like a bit naff.
Exactly.
How do we do, Jamie? Who gets a B-minus? Who gets a C-plus?
I think both of those are great in general, because the other thing that I didn't chat about is that he creates a real technical kind of problem as well, which is the draw distance of the world and how fast he can fly and how much you can see.
N64 fog, that is the solution.
Exactly, N64 fog and lots of rings. But the approach that I also like, and it's not out yet obviously, but the new Suicide Squad game, which is you don't do any of the superhero kind of fantasy and you actually do the opposite, which is it's a one versus many scenario. So Superman is the bad guy and you are a group trying to take Superman down.
And then that way you don't have to artificially kind of nerf him or restrict his abilities. It's just that he's not a playable character in that scenario. But all of those are pretty cool.
Good choices.
I'm looking forward to... Whatever is happening at the Suicide Squad, the central hook of bringing down those icons, I think is a good one.
I reckon that when it re-emerges, they'll probably show off a part of the game that maybe sells it in a different light than shoot some weak spots and people get on board. That's a 2024 prediction, though, Matthew. So save that for a future episode.
What's this next one? How to provide rapid transportation but minimize taking the player out of the experience. Explain this one, Jamie.
Yes, a little bit of context. This has been a personal book, Bear, for a long time because I've worked on a lot of open world games. So typically, in most open world games, you go to the towers, you unlock a bunch of icons that allow you to fast travel, you play through the game, you end up having a map with so many icons or things to do that it's not worth traveling across the land again.
So therefore, you start rapid teleporting. And a lot of people do that to get 100% on games as well. But the thing that bugs me is the majority of the time people spend in the menus to effectively get from A to B.
Why can't you get from A to B faster in the game without taking them out of the experience? So one example that comes to mind is in Spider-Man. Some people like using the web slinging in Spider-Man.
It's a little bit slower than going on the map, but because it feels so satisfying that people do it. And it remains to be seen with the second one, with the bigger city and how much further you have to travel. But that's my kind of question here to you is, how you think games have dealt with getting from A to B quickly, but not taking the player out of the experience.
It's funny because Starfield just came out and Starfield is a whole game of going into menus and selecting fast travel points basically. It's probably the most contentious element of that game. I don't know if I know the solution to this.
It's always like you say, maybe it's having the right sort of traversal, traversal based powers that make you excited about using those powers and navigating the world as Spider-Man did. I feel like I never really used the fast travel in Spider-Man until I got to the ticking things off for 100% phase of that game towards the end. And we've made a point as well now of actually talking up the fast travel system because it loads so quickly on PS5 because of the SSD, obviously.
It's actually seen as a plus because they're selling as, you're fast traveling so quickly, it's almost too fast. And that's its own sort of, I guess, take on the problem. The idea is that the process is so short, you don't even think about doing it while you're doing it.
So, I don't know, I mean, there's part of me that wonders, could you do something like you sort of point at the horizon line and maybe you press a button and then you get a list of sort of hotspots on the map and then you select within the in-game UI, okay, I want to go to this place and it tells you how many meters away you are from that place. And so you're selecting a bunch of locations, but you're never actually leaving the game and going into a menu. That's maybe one solution I could think of.
Maybe that relates to, you know, the kind of like the tower thing we were talking earlier. These are the towers you've been to, these are the ones you can fast travel to, and you're just selecting them from that in-game interface. That's pretty much the only solution I can really think of for this.
What about you, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, it's difficult. I'm maybe trying to tackle it from like eliminating the desire for fast travel, which is probably even harder of making something that's so compelling, which is kind of the Spider-Man thing of like, it just feels so nice. But I guess like the two kind of curves you're kind of dealing with is kind of like how quickly you get bored of like a location, because that's often what does it for me.
It's more like, oh, I'm just sick of this place and I just want to get there super fast. And but also having like your navigation developing like Spider-Man. I feel like those two curves are quite evenly matched, which is why you don't like travel.
I didn't start really fast traveling much until like Samuel, like right at the end mopping up stuff because I felt like, you know, Spider-Man was evolving to always kind of like replace the boredom that I was maybe developing at the setting being the same over and over again. But not everyone has a Spider-Man or something as dynamic as that.
I have one other thought on this actually as well, which is that you introduce, I guess the pterodactyl in Horizon is sort of an example of this, but you introduce a post-game, like basically game breaking form of transportation that's so fast and so fun. You actually want to use it and not use fast travel because you have this new toy that the game has given you to mop up the rest of the things in the game. So, yeah, those are, yeah.
It is difficult that that relationship though of like, when you give someone a big tool which really changes, like the pterodactyl, like all of a sudden, all of those navigation problems, any navigation puzzle you haven't solved is basically nuked all at once. And like maintain, I often find, there's so many games I've played where they've just done something where I'm like, well, I'm not really interested in this anymore. Like this thing was just too powerful or kind of, why would I do any of these things?
Actually, for me, often it's the end boss. Like once I finished a story, I'm like, well, any power I'm developing narratively was to take down this thing. Like it's why I won't, like why I'm not like powering through to the end of Tears of the Kingdom.
Because I think once I've beaten Ganon, it's going to be like, well, I don't need to do anything else because there's nothing worse in this world than Ganon, you know?
Yeah. And it's the availability of that as well. I mean, the only other ones that I had that come to mind is, you know, one is making the world smaller, you know, Yakuza kind of style.
You do everything on foot. Another one is I've not played this too much, but apparently you guys will probably know more than me that Death Stranding, the more you play the game, the more connections you can make in the world with other players and create zipline kind of routes. And that's another way, it's kind of the divide and conquer approach.
The world is too big to take on on your own in terms of fast travel, but everybody works together and creates a network of stuff that makes things kind of faster. You know, that's interesting.
That is great in Death Stranding. But then that's, I would say that's like, that's Death Stranding's kind of whole deal is that that is its one big, really good idea. And then there's lots of like weird shit around it.
But I do buy it. But, you know, fundamentally, it is a game about building infrastructure that he disguised as something a lot weirder.
Well, I'm enjoying this scenario of us being asked to be backseat game designers, Jamie. That's good fun. So hope our rapid transportation ideas there at least flicks something on for you.
But yeah. Okay, cool. So this next one, how do you reintegrate or reengage lapsed players?
This is a very broad one.
Yes. So very specifically, this comes back to a time when I was playing Wind Waker a lot of years ago and I left the boat out in the ocean somewhere. I saved the game, put the game down, and I come back maybe 12 months or so kind of later with no context as to where I was, what I was kind of doing next.
The game's not really signposting very well what my next objective is. And you spend a whole bunch of time not only kind of trying to figure out what you were trying to do, but in some cases fighting controls that you had muscle memory of maybe six months prior or wherever it may be. And I mean, Fortnite is a good one at the moment where they use bots.
So if you come back to the game in a new season or you've not been on it for a while, they'll put you in a game of bots. So basically you have a higher chance of learning the game and winning chicken dinner or wherever it may be. But yeah, what either of your takes are on, if you've not played a game in a long time and then you come back to it.
Yeah, I restart a lot. Like there's some games where I'm like, fuck it. I weigh up and go, I'm so confused.
And do I think I'm ever going to be able to work it out? And I've restarted some like substantial RPGs from the start because I'm like, nah, I'm not going to enjoy this unless I do it from the beginning, which isn't a solution.
No, I'm the same Matthew. I've done God of War 2018. I started it three times until I finally cracked it.
I got to the same relatively the same point, which is when they start, when they go into that elf realm. In fact, towards the end of that elf realm, I got to that point twice. And then only on the next play through did I keep going.
And I'm glad I did because the game actually gets better from there. But also Final Fantasy IX is one I've played 10 hours of, I think seven times now. I always get to the same point.
If you add that up, that's a whole campaign of Final Fantasy IX. Exactly.
It's a big waste of time. I think like the... So I guess, Jamie, there are two layers to this.
So if we're talking about a narrative based game, there is a catching you up on the story element that is actually unrelated to the gameplay. So I have seen some games try a kind of TV show style previously on function, which I think actually is a really good solution to this. Just to reorient you in the story.
And then maybe by doing that, you will feel comfortable slipping back into the game more generally. When it comes to something that's like purely mechanic space, like a multiplayer game, I do think that Fortnite is a good solution. The thing is, I almost think that when you re-engage it with a multiplayer game, the part of the excitement is discovering what has changed since you were gone.
But also there is an element of distress with that, where you're like, oh, they've added crafting to Apex Legends. They've cycled out this map that I like and understand. This weapon I used to get is now like a gold weapon I can only get at certain times, and it can be quite daunting.
So yeah, I suppose putting you up against bots or easy players kind of is the way to do it. I think actually in Apex's case, I really feel an invisible hand at work that is allowing me to have a few easy games before it chucks me back into the deep end. And then I'm basically cannon fodder for some 20-year-old fucking Twitch streamer.
That's essentially my function in that game. So yeah, just some vague thoughts there, Matthew. I don't know if you have anything to add.
I love the idea. You're just meat for someone else's grinder.
It really feels like that. But yeah, Matthew, anything more to add?
Yeah, I mean, short of like incredibly basic bitch ideas.
Like having tutorials you can return to, or like a practice area or a combat area. Games that I've bounced off of for leaving too long are often quite advanced action games, like the Platinum Games, for example, where you come back and you're like, how the fuck does Bayonetta work? Like, I don't get this.
But then they often have a space that you can go to with Bayonetta to like fuck around in and just find that muscle memory again there. But that feels like the most obvious shit in the world. And here's the tutorial area again that you can come back to.
I think the idea of the game detecting or your last save files from two years ago, would you like us to turn tooltips back on? That's not actually a bad shout, Matthew. So yeah, I quite like that.
Jamie, your take?
No, I mean, all of those are good. That last one that you just mentioned is exactly the type of thing I've been thinking of kind of recently, is why does the game not kind of entice you or not recognize what you've been doing? And I don't know how well it's been integrated, but I think that's partially what the platform feature on PlayStation is trying to do, you know, the activity cards.
If you hover on the game, it says, you're 90% of the way to the, you know, the boss or wherever it may be. Click this button. We will teleport you straight there.
It doesn't solve the muscle memory with controls, but the thing you mentioned about a tutorial area, that's kind of perfect. You know, a bunch of games have shooting ranges in Call of Duty, Sekiro. You can go fight that guy, you know, the undead kind of guy.
So all of that stuff is kind of valid, but it's just one of those where you come back to a game. And I should say all of these curse problems, some people may think that these are not necessarily problems, so it's up to the, you know, the team if they want to kind of take this stuff on. But all of those are kind of valid, you know, regardless of how simple they may be.
There's quite an interesting thing that's sort of slightly adjacent to this and relevant right now is that Cyberpunk 2077 has obviously had this huge update where they've basically changed their whole perk system. So like your character build, and in the past, I think, maybe I'm remembering this wrong, but when they've done big changes maybe to The Witcher 3, sometimes your old saves just aren't compatible anymore, and they're like, you have to play, any save going forward will be in this new version and it doesn't work with this old version of the game, and that makes sense. But here they don't do that.
If you go in with your end game save, say you play 70 hours at launch, if you go in now, it basically says, we've refunded you all of your ability points, like a game's worth of ability points to put into this perk tree so that you can just build your character. And actually, it's cool that it works, but I think it's probably one of the worst things about this new update in that it's asking you to basically fast forward through the whole power curve of a game that you've not experienced in its new form. You're like, I don't know which of these perks go together because I need to start with the low level perks, get a feel for that character, and then start building them out and start fixing them with other decisions.
And you're basically... You know, it literally says, make by 50 abilities at once, and you're like, I have... What the fuck do I need to do with that?
Like, it's kind of insane, but I can also understand why they've... Like, that they want to give you that freedom. It's like...
That must have given them some, like, major headaches.
Okay. Well, we come to final curse design problem here, Jamie.
Yes.
Matthew, do you want to read this one out?
How can we make player health more meaningful and have less reliance on passive regen?
So this is... I mean, when you think about the top first-person shooters, I mean, even Halo, you know, with the shield kind of regen, Call of Duty, that for the best part of the last 20 years, the way that you regain health, and it's the way that, you know, when you said earlier ingrained kind of knowledge or things that people rely on, the best way to get your health back in the top first-person games in the world is to go stand behind a rock for five seconds. And I'm kind of like, why has that something not been addressed for the best part of 20 years?
And whenever somebody comes up with a new idea for what the new norm kind of becomes, you know, I wouldn't say they'd be a millionaire, but they'll kind of set a new standard. But at the same time, working on Call of Duty, they used to say that that was a really important part of the pacing of the game, which is you pop out, shoot some enemies, you take a couple of shots, you reload your gun, which is a natural kind of break from combat, and you hide behind cover. And during that short window, you know, you get your kind of health back.
But for me, it's more the passive kind of aspect of, you know, effectively standing behind a rock for five seconds. So what's your thoughts?
OK, I have a take on this. That's OK, Matthew. I think that Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal solve this really well.
That's what I was going to say.
Yeah, I think the idea that like basically is that, you know, there's that Rezi style shoot and do a melee attack thing where you draw health from an enemy doing it that way. I'm not necessarily saying it needs to be a melee attack, but it's the idea of performing a specific action, fulfilling a specific parameter and you getting some kind of health bonus or boost from performing that action. Therefore, the action continues and you don't have that break in service.
Matthew, are you going to say the same thing?
Yeah, yeah. I think of all the shooters I've played in the last 10 years, Doom was the one where I felt, oh, this rhythm is pulling you into a different style of play. This is an anti-cover shooter.
It's about getting up in people's faces and it forces constant engagement in a way that I was like, I thought that was pretty genius. I think Doom Eternal, the way it up those stakes even further by throwing more ammo types and things like that into the mix to pull you around the full arsenal as well. I thought that felt like something genuinely new was happening.
One thing I will add to that though, I suppose, is that there is another pacing element at play specifically with Doom, which is you have this three waves of enemy that are pause pacing element to it, which is maybe not necessarily applicable to all games the same way. No, no.
It felt distinct to that. I'm not saying like, every game you need to sap health from the thing you kill.
I suppose, Jamie, what do you think of that as an existing solution to that? What do you think of it?
It's the same with all of these things, which are there is no one size fits all solution. For example, I couldn't see Call of Duty doing the push forward into the battlefield of World War II to collect health, so then it becomes an experience kind of thing. The top-down stuff we mentioned earlier, the experience is a greatly realistic kind of scenario, so it wouldn't necessarily suit there.
At the same time, I suppose it's a player-specific kind of fantasy, because the one that comes to mind for me is Bloodborne. You take the damage, and the way you regain the damage is by being aggressive. But, on that point, Bloodborne is the least favorite of mine in terms of the Soulsborne games, for exactly that reason, which is it's overly aggressive for somebody who normally likes to turtle behind a shield.
The Doom example is probably a bit too arcade-y for something like Call of Duty to integrate. There's no middle ground, but these are the types of things that people will debate over for months, and then eventually will just say, let's just do what Call of Duty does. That's ultimately the way it normally happens.
Actually, to give... I wasn't just dunking on Cyberpunk, talking about its mad perk buyback thing, but one thing that I do like about the new perk trees that they've added in this 2.0 update, it acknowledges that a valid play style is that kind of doom, constantly moving, not going in cover, not recovering. There are perks that make you harder to hit when you're sprinting and things like that.
It's not so much how it's doing health regen, but it rewards you with some invulnerability for momentum and speed. That seems like a part of the same kind of question, in a way. It's dealing with damage rather than health, but I thought that was quite novel.
Also, interestingly, that was a game which, before 2.0, had health packs. It was a finite resource. You'd have 70 med packs.
Now health is an item with two charges on a timer. So it basically is the... It's not hide behind a rock and it'll come back in five seconds.
The cooldown is much longer than that. But it is a reliable but limited resource that you can rely on.
Matthew, can you unlock anything to hasten the process? Have they done anything like that?
Yeah, well, the nature of the health item you have equipped, better health items will move faster or recharge faster. There are other perks or there are cyberware. You can have a build which is focused on health regeneration over anything else.
But that's quite nerdy and RPG-ish.
You say that, but actually when looking at this question, it made me think again of Apex Legends, which does also have health as an item. You have choices you make as a player, whether you use a small health item or a large one. Yeah, the timing.
It takes a lot of time to use a large one. Absolutely, but there are also factors that can affect how impactful those items are. You can get a specific backpack, for example, I think it is, that allows you to use the small ones, but they are I think like twice as powerful.
So you just are popping these small ones really quickly and restoring your health incredibly quickly. So it is making you think about how you get your health back in a way that maybe Call of Duty doesn't, where you're just hiding behind cover. So yeah, I don't know.
I guess like Matthew, it's not necessarily just an RPG way of thinking. It sounds like she was a thought about this as well. Jamie, your thoughts?
No, all of those are good, as I said. That's the one I was going to mention just to finish it off. It's just about the Fortnite battle royale style, which is the health is a meaningful choice and actually is a really important part of the game because without the health, you've lost the core objective of the game, which is survival, the interaction time.
I think Fortnite does it with fish. If you go fishing, which is a small mini game, some of the best items are in that for the time to kind of health benefits that you get in this particular kind of scenario. But just to kind of sum up those kind of cursed and common things is just that some of those are the types of curve balls that you might be thrown in kind of design interviews as well, and it can spurn off entire kind of discussions like this for hours in kind of meeting rooms and stuff.
But yeah, if you're both in the interview room, you're both hired. Lots of good ideas.
Now I've just got to learn how to do literally any other part of game design. If I can do that, I'll be well away.
I'm going to be a creative director. I'm just going to walk in, say the good ideas, and get the fuck out of there.
Indiana Jones hat. See you later. I'm going for lunch.
Okay. Well, that's great. I mean, Jamie, so much effort you've put into planning this episode.
I really appreciate it. It's been great to have you.
This has genuinely been so much fun. This has been like the most fun I've had doing one of these episodes in ages.
That's great. Yeah.
Top five episode, I think, for sure. So, yeah, really grateful to have you, and would love to have you back to talk more about games that you like at some point, too. That'd be cool if you fancy it.
So, yeah. Where can people find you on social media, Jamie?
Yeah. Again, thanks very much for having me both. I've absolutely loved it myself.
But, yeah, I'm on Twitter or wherever that kind of dumpster is now, at Smithstock. So, SMITHST0CK, because somebody from the NHS has stolen the O.
You can't be mad with them from the NHS, I guess.
Exactly. They've got a better reason for that. But, yeah, it's the same on Blue Sky and the other services, at Smithstock.
Awesome. The podcast, you can follow at BackpagePod on Twitter and Blue Sky now as well. You can support us on patreon.com/backpagepod if you like the work we do.
You want to chuck some money our way. Two tiers there, including a tier with extra podcasts in it. Matthew, where can people find you?
At MrBazzill underscore pester.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter and Blue Sky. Thank you so much for listening.
I'll be back next week. Goodbye.
