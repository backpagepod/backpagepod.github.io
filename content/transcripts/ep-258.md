Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. My name is Samuel Roberts and I've forgotten how to introduce these podcasts. I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello, that was weird, wasn't it? I just what is it? Welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts. Is that what I normally do? Whatever you said just then, I was like, oh, that's not right. Yeah. I'm Samuel Roberts, so enjoyed as ever by Matthew King. And then I say hello. Does that sound right? Do you know what? The year is definitely taking a toll on me. I c I can't remember how to even do this anymore. But um nonetheless, you are listening to the back page. Welcome This is our alternate game of the year awards episode. Next week is our game of the year episode, so you get a full suite of The best games that we've been playing this year, two top ten lists that myself and Matthew have spent uh basically the entire year sweating over, so that will come to a head next week, one way or another. Which is exciting. But I always enjoy this, Matthew. This is very magazine coded, I think. You know, we just kind of create categories around games. We bring back some categories from previous alternate game of the year uh episodes that we've done. I feel like for a while we were trying to feeling our way around what a sort of good Christmas episode format was for us and I think we've found it now.

Matthew
01:33
I think there was some attempts to make them very Christmassy or have like a lot of Christmas content which maybe isn't like brilliantly evergreen. I like this as a sort of uh here's all the games that aren't gonna be on the game of the year list. Some of them are. You know. Oh yeah. Many of them will be for me, just to be clear. But yes. Uh Yeah, I've definitely but I you know, it's it's a chance to celebrate some stuff that won't necessarily get a big look in next week. So and we've got some guests. Indeed.

Samuel
02:02
Noel's house party style, but less cursed. And we will have, or maybe more cursed. Who knows? We will have the odd sort of like ring of the doorbell and some special guests will pop by and talk about their games of the year. All people who have been on the back page this year, obviously we're very grateful for their time. Delighted to have them back. For me actually making the podcast, this is the one part of the production of each episode that I I know nothing about. I don't know how it's going for Matthew. in terms of getting these, I don't know what his outreach looks like, but I like one message from Dave Scarborough saying I've had a ping from Matthew about this, but that's the only insight I've had in the process. So Oh right. I hope he didn't No, I know what he's gonna pick. Um and uh yeah, it's uh it's a good choice if I do say so myself. But I think people actually are are delighted to be remembered and asked to come back to be honest. So I think it's uh a nice way to celebrate all the people who have helped make the podcast. A bit richer this year, Matthew. Very festive, isn't it? Sort of inviting everyone round for tea, except not really, which would be much more demanding and uh probably quite annoying. So it's it's much easier to do it this way where they're not in your house, but then nonetheless appear on the podcast. I don't really know where I'm going with this, to be honest. But um yes. Nonetheless, let's get on with the alternative awards, shall we, Matthew? Because we've got loads of categories to go through. I think we've added about six or seven and then brought back every single one we did last year. So it's really it's like three, a four pages. My my plan for this episode is twelve hundred words long That's like a feature at Edge. That's massive. A short feature, but a feature nonetheless. So yeah, actually I did you struggle with many of these? How did you find the process of That Answering each one.

Matthew
03:31
Some of them I struggled for ages and then I saw a game name later that I'd forgotten about and then suddenly was like, Oh that's a better answer, I'll put that instead. So uh I think maybe I should have approached it game first rather than category first. because my head basically went to like three games for every single category and was like, well this isn't gonna be particularly riveting listening so Yeah, uh but so I think I I think they've done I've done okay.

Samuel
03:58
Yeah, I will say that I mean there's one category we brought back from last year that in our document Matthew tagged as this one always makes me chuckle And it's bit from a game that a location from a game that would make a great hitman level. And this year, that was a fucking nightmare. So that one was sat unanswered. Oh, it's good f it's bad for you too, was it? It was just sat there in the dock unanswered for days. So um Yeah. That was that was a struggle. I have got an answer there, Matthew.

Matthew
04:23
I got there in the end, so uh I've got a couple of categories which currently don't have answers, and I'm gonna desperately try and make it sound like I do have answers when we get to them. See if you can that's a fun little extra meta game for this episode. Can you work out which three categories did I not have answers for?

Samuel
04:43
So uh yeah, um I promise I'll keep it fair. I'll I'll I won't do any of that. I'll launch straight into them. I just thought of such a better answer for that hitman one actually. Like a way better answer. That just really hit me out of nowhere then. I think it was talking to you actually. The the game in question that I've I've subbed in is very Matthew Castle coded. So that probably um probably unlodged uh dislodged my memory a little bit. But anyway, on with the awards. Shall we take it in turns reading these out, Matthew, the categories, and then answering them, that might make sense, so people don't get bored of my voice.

Matthew
05:14
Yeah, I mean some of them are just two words long, so it's not like a huge respite from the other host. But

Samuel
05:20
Nonetheless, we will do it that way. And see how it goes. So, category one, best hang, Matthew. Ye What have you got for this?

Matthew
05:27
I picked that lad who really likes football in Despolote.

Samuel
05:31
Oh right, okay, interesting. I mean, I did wonder if this game would be a bit of a featured player in this episode because I know it won't make either of our top tens, but it was a cool game.

Matthew
05:41
Just good vibes. Like it's very weird that you you get to play as a character who's just like a pure enthusiast about something. And That is what the game is as an expression of that and I guess an expression of the the people who made it as well. But it's it's a good hang. It can you be a good hang if you're in their body? Can you hang in someone's body? That's the We never see him But you do hear him sometimes, do you?

Samuel
06:02
Yeah. So yeah, I guess I I think he s he seems like a good he seems like a sweet kid. Yeah, I mean I I maybe this is not the place for this, but I've put Pinky from Promise Mascot Agency, who is Clearly the character of the year, clearly the best video game character of this year. But uh maybe Best Hang is not quite correct because I don't think you always want to spend time with Pinky, but she is very funny, so Yeah, very different energy to the football lad. Yeah, well I got a follow-up that was sort of like a Run-Us-Up award for my guy Lu Bei from the first half of Dynasty Warriors Origins. Where you're like, oh, I think he's just a decent dude trying to re really trying to make this happen in the old three kingdoms. But then he cucks out in the second half of the game and um I don't mean that. I just won't Made myself laugh by writing that down in my document. And then just really never rises to the occasion. And you're there going, Come on, mate, I've I've just banned a thousand lads for you and he's a bit like, uh, I'm not sure I've really got it in me to be leading all this and You got old um uh Sao Cao coming in and um kicking his ass. It's just really disappointing to be honest. But you know, I know what it's like to to back disappointing leaders voting for left-wing parties in the UK, so it's not an unfamiliar experience to me. But um anyway, that all of that is to say, Matthew, category one is done and we can move on to the next one. Do you want to read out this one? The next one is, if you can believe it, worst hang. Yeah, okay, so I picked Yutsule from Avald in this one, who's kind of like a a pink or purple lady who is always talking openly about her horny nonsense and like having sex with her husband And you're like, just shut up. She's like she's by far the worst character. I think she's the last one that gets added to your party in a vowed. And she's just like always just being oversharing. Right. And you need to take her into the world because there are like these pink crystal things that only she can break, so you are kind of obliged to take her, but the second those were done in the maps, I was like, Off you go, Yatsley, that's it. If I get the chance to off you, I will Um but I didn't.

Matthew
07:58
Just oh god, she's uh yeah, a really bad hang. And she's meant to be a good hang. You're like the companion's primary role is to be a good hang. Oi, interesting hang.

Samuel
08:07
Well that's it. I think the problem with Avald is that it starts with the best hang, which is Kai the Fishman, played by the voice of Garus. And then just kind of works its way down. Like the second guy you get is pretty cool as well. O Third the lady you add, they add third is like, eh, kind of alright, but not not really uh sort of like that memorable and then Yuxley is memorable for all the wrong reasons. Uh by the way, like uh a runner up here for the main character in Baby Steps, um the way he delivers all of his dialogue in the cutscenes is just like I hate that style of humour, does nothing for me. So um in he goes, really Matthew, but what have you got for worst hang? I'll be allowed to vote for an entire species. I thought you were about to pick me. for worst hang. And it was gonna be like this ultimate kind of meta moment of the podcast, but who's the who's the species? Gestrals in Expedition 33. I think that's fair, I will allow it.

Matthew
08:56
I just hated them. They're a big reason I uh I haven't finished that game. It's just didn't like 'em, didn't like how wacky they were. A big wacky species of like weird puppet men. Not into that at all.

Samuel
09:07
They don't come back much in the second half of the game though. They're that's kind of it. They're their first bit is kind of all they really do.

Matthew
09:13
Oh well they made me run a it's a real gestral gauntlet that first act. That's quite a hard sell. Just just a little bit too wacky for me. If I had to pick one character It's uh the horrible jealous girl Rinko in Silent Hill F.

Samuel
09:27
Oh yeah, what a piece of shit.

Matthew
09:28
Terrible hang. Did she push you down the stairs? Didn't she push you down the stairs? I don't know, but she's a if you have to ask those questions of someone, they're probably a bad hang.

Samuel
09:37
Yeah. Yeah, her energy is just way off and uh your character's way too nice to her as well. And you're a bit like, I mean, you know, can we not just push her into like the deadly red plants? In general, I think that game is really good at making it seem like nothing is scarier than like they are actually scarier than the monsters in that game, so fair play to uh the developers of Sant Hill F What about the um there's like a sex mascot in Promise Mascot Agency? I think that would probably go into my short list of worst hangs as well. Yeah. There's one who's just a little bit dildo-y, a little bit

Matthew
10:14
The thing is though, once you've enlisted them and signed their contract and sort of send them off for work, I know you can do the sort of friendship missions with them and and whatnot, but You don't have to sort of interact with loads of them.

Samuel
10:27
No. There's also that like one that looks like a very angry old man that you find in that tunnel. Uh he's also like quite a bad hang, I think. Um but you are right, like once they're sort of assigned, they're sort of out of your way, really. They're your employees, they're your staff. They're not really like featured players. So um Yeah. Okay. Well then on to the next category Matthew, which is the critics got this wrong award. I mean I'm always kind of keen to hear your take on this one. So uh because I know you like whenever whenever you you do disagree strongly with something, I do hear about it on WhatsApp and it does um does always make me chuckle.

Matthew
10:59
Yeah, I don't do it in public because these are my peers and um we all respect each other. Um for this, I mean it's not particularly spicy. Some people did like it. I picked Mercury Steam's Blades of Fire. Oh right, yeah. Really forgotten. Was that this year? Yeah, it was this year, which i it had some absolutely stinking reviews. No one really loved it. I don't think I saw higher than a seven out of ten, but I thought, you know, in the crowded souls-ish genre which isn't something I normally go for. I thought it had its own pace, thought it had its own ideas. It has that kind of you know, its own art design. I I'm not saying it's a spiritual successor to Castlevania Lords of Shadows, but there's like some through lines. uh has some absolutely amazing environmental work, you know, some really knotty, interesting, fancy locations to explore. Just lots of like weird little twists and its own ideas. I I thought it was it was pretty good. It hasn't made my top ten for the end of the year, but there was a point where I was like, uh, Miss could maybe be like number ten You know, but then that was like a third of the way into the year and l and lots more interesting stuff came out. But uh I thought it deserved a little bit of love. I think it's a game people may discover for like ten quid or fifteen quid in a sale down the line and and actually have a pretty good time with it.

Samuel
12:18
Yeah, I think that's a a good call. I think it was just you and Eurogamers Tom Ori who liked this game, wasn't it? And then everyone else kind of was down on it.

Matthew
12:26
But games

Samuel
12:27
G I think Games Radar was relatively on its side. It j it just really came and went, and you would think that I don't know, it was of the type of game where I thought it would make a bigger splash than it did. And it's like if they'd have ripped off Dark Souls 30% more. Would more people have liked it or played it? Yeah, I've still got it and I've still not played it. I just I completely forgot it happened this year. It just really became a footnote so quickly.

Matthew
12:49
And um It's got some really good old fashioned chopping heads off with massive swords and like splatting arms off. It's it's like a real kind of 1990s version of video game violence, which I which I quite enjoyed.

Samuel
13:02
So I had a couple of suggestions for this. I wondered if Hell Is Us was a little bit underrated. I've not finished it, Matthew. But um I did think that in some years I feel like maybe it just caught the wrong moment of a really busy time. It launched in September. and just sort of disappeared straight away. Had that really bold message at the start about not holding your hand really and then leaving you as the player to sort of get on with it. And then kind of just got sevens at around that range and It is like repetitive combat-wise, but it is interesting. It does do what it says on the tin in terms of leaving you to figure out what to do, to the point where if you boot the game up after leaving it for a month. as I did recently. It's absolutely perplexing to remember what it is you're supposed to be doing. But you know, quite a cool game, not that long. I've not finished it, but I did think that the tone of it maybe uh made it m more worthwhile highlighting than it really got from media, like the the actual story and uh w you know, kind of its its commentary on mankind and his themes that are relevant. Like it just feels like it maybe one day it'll be a cult classic, but in the meantime just felt Uh pretty ignored. Um yeah, I don't know. I'm not even saying I'm disagreeing with the scores as such, but it just deserved more than it got, you know. What do you think?

Matthew
14:15
Yeah, I mean it came in did it come out the same day as Silkson or the same week? It was something like that, yeah. I mean it just didn't it didn't have a chance. But I've s I've seen Andy Kelly going to bat for this one on social media. It's one of those he's he's got a he's got good taste.

Samuel
14:30
He has. I thought he had a very good top ten actually for the year. I was quite um quite impressed by his list making skills there. Um I've seen some bad top tens, that was a good one. So Well done to Andy Kelly. See uh the other one I was gonna say was did you know that Promise Mask got agency was under eighty on Metacritic? It's like seventy-seven. It's seventy-seven. Like why is it How did that happen? Why is it that low? I I was glad to read that. Some people just really did not get it. And it is a game that I think if you get it, you really like it. But if you don't get it, you're probably gonna be like quite offended by it. So yeah, I was quite shocked to read that and quite sad because everyone should play that. Um we've banged on about it enough on this podcast. So um Yep, that was my other suggestion, Matthew. What's the next category?

Matthew
15:12
The Alarm Award for the most offensive customers. This feels like very pointed 2024 commentary, this award.

Samuel
15:19
Uh yeah, but I mean there's always people who are defensive, aren't there, about games. And so that's why I'm gonna have to give this one to Matthew Castle for Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. It's I'm tough but fair, Beth you know that's not really what I uh had down for you.

Matthew
15:32
I wrote down me for Nintendo Switch 2 welcome tour.

Samuel
15:36
Well, I don't I I thought that was quite fun this year, you going to bat for that game. But uh y explain your workings then, Matthew.

Matthew
15:43
I mean it's just a fact. I am incredibly defensive of this game, which is one of the the lowest scoring games on Metacritic this year, which I think is absolutely baffling. Uh I was just surprised by people's total lack of curiosity. about like the the information sort of held within the game, which I did find interesting, and I know I've banged on about it on this podcast being adjacent to my beloved Awata asks, but Yeah, I c I kinda like hearing about how Nintendo come to these conclusions. I like the little tech demos. I I think it's alright. I think it's alright. I just think people I don't know, it's very rare that you can give a Nintendo game like a proper kick in and people seem to sort of relish the chance. But that's that's okay.

Samuel
16:32
I think it represented a bit of the anxieties people had about the Switch 2 and like the price of the games and all that stuff. In some ways I think that It was punishing Nintendo a little bit for that. And uh yeah, I you know, it's it became a little bit unnecessary in some cases, I agree. I just don't think it's that offensive. It's like a it's like an eight or a nine, right? Well I'd say it's like a six maybe. Yeah or like an eight or a nine Well thing is, uh buying a magazine now costs like seven quid, right? So it this was kinda like buying a magazine and it was eight quid. It's it's kinda like you get you know, information from it. I I guess it's a big deal. That's what it is. The thing is I I came to the conclusion that it should have been a pack in for sure. But Um and I know how you feel about that. But uh I don't know, it's not that offensive in the grand scheme of things really. I've spent eight quid on many worse things, like one pint in London, for example. That's uh a much worse use of eight quid than than that. But my actual suggestion for this, Matthew, was I think that Japanese RPG fans who bang on about the genre not being taken seriously in the two thousands need to take it down a notch. Because I feel like What they're angry about is three guys in America 20 years ago who said something racist on like a TV show that doesn't exist anymore. And so they are acting like they're the underdogs of like video games and that people have always been after this genre, and I just think it's a bit of a bullshit narrative because Claire Obscure's winning every award this year. It's really good. No one is like talking it down. And Square Enix is still making lots of cool, interesting stuff. They're always out there repackaging Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games because guess what? It's a their best-selling series. They make a lot of money. There is no underdog narrative for the J uh the JRPG. I think it's all fiction in the heads of people who want to believe they're underdogs and they need to get over it because yeah, it's just done. That's what I think about about that. I just Do you know what I mean? I didn't even know that was happening when I was like playing Final Fantasy XII in 2007.

Matthew
18:42
Yeah, it's it's there's a lot of that doing the rounds on social media and the like of One person said this and so that's what everyone felt. And you're like, I don't think that is entirely true. Um you know, these are this is like a genre which is probably like one of the most formative genres for for most of my peers and friends and people I generally know, you know, have a have a JRPG pass.

Samuel
19:05
So I think it's like a really a big overreaction to a a brief period in the 360 era where These games were maybe not in vogue on PS3 and 360 for about like uh three or four years. Because a lot of them were bad then. Well that's the thing. Then the wheel turned again And uh people moved on. I just yeah, I I feel like I've seen they've seen Claire Obscure as a clarion call and I just think they need they need to take it down a notch. So uh yeah. There it is, Matthew. Okay. Most surprising game of this year, for better or worse. I picked dispatch for this. Oh, that's a good call.

Matthew
19:39
Mainly because it's some remnants of Telltale and I thought the whole Telltale game structure was pretty played out. That combined with we're gonna do an edgy superhero game which there's so much edgy superhero media out there. Put those thit two things together and I just thought this was gonna have absolutely nothing new or interesting to say and Actually, it it works for the really old-fashioned reasons. It's just it's well written, it's funny, it's well performed, it's just very winning, you know, as a as a piece of storytelling. And I you know, I went in fully ready to like roll my eyes and turn it off after half an hour, but it definitely got its claws into me. I don't think it's one of the year's best for me, but I thought this was gonna be a disaster. So uh share so much I know.

Samuel
20:29
Yeah, I thought anything that was knocking on the door of being telltale like was in a similar boat, but it has become one of the games of the year. It's Probably a bit overrated at this point to be honest. I think that the game part of it is really no great shakes and people's goodwill for the story is overriding their their actual kind of perception of what the game part is is doing, the game part is just not very interesting. But a cool game for sure. And I think probably will make my top ten, Matthew, spoiler alert. So um it might do. I mean this uh it's it's still shifting around, that's the thing. The number one's changed like three times the last week, so it it's a hard year to get your arms around as we'll talk about when we do that episode, but yeah. I put Silent Hill F for this, and the fact that it's a game built around replays, which is pretty unusual for a horror game, the idea of like a story that take shape the more you play it. Now I understand this is probably more to do with the creative talent that are behind this game. I think it's a clearly special game, but I actually think that it was so tall an order in terms of what it asked some replays v versus like the combat in the game and the demands of that that it was actually that was actually kind of a reason I didn't I have not like seen it all the way through. But it is bold to build a game story around replaying it in the way that they did. What do you think?

Matthew
21:50
I don't know if it was a surprise Just because uh you know, I n you know, knew the writer involved and had I had hoped that his style and his ideas wouldn't get drowned out by the rest of whatever Sidney L F had to be. And I don't think it did. So I don't want to be smug and say, mmm, this is a bit of a I told you so. I knew this was gonna be good story wise. But I certainly hoped it was going to be good And I think as a story it was. I wish the game was maybe a little bit more fun to replay.

Samuel
22:21
Yeah, I don't think it's very fun to play generally. It's like and it it has the kind of narrative context and themes that a Silent Hill game needs. And I think it's it was already from day one gonna be a cult classic. It was already gonna be a game that people in three years go. The best Silent Hill game was the one that they made after Team Silent disbanded. Like that sort of piece. Right. That will be a thing in like two, three years. There'll be th YouTube thumbnails. doing that and they won't be correct but it will at least be a perspective that people are putting out there. Yeah, an intra a super interesting game. I will go back to it at some point. I don't know, it's it's bold to do something like that with the first original Silent Hill game in a long time so Kind of applauding that more than anything, Matthew. Should we have a guest? Oh yes, let's do that.

Joe
23:15
Hello my friends, it's Joe Screbles. Thank you for inviting me to talk about games. I like them. I set myself the challenge of finding a game of the year to talk about. That had not been discussed on the podcast this year. But I also want to shout about lots of things because I'm greedy I've had a wildly good time with multiplayer this year, which I very rarely do, which means I've played rematch. Amazing! Arcraders, amazing. Skate, amazing. Don't believe people when they complain about skate. They just don't have friends. And it's also been a really good year for little single-player games. I loved Citizen Sleeper 2. I loved Blue Prince. I loved Promise Mascot Agency. But I don't think anyone on this podcast has discussed Monster Train 2. Not a game I expected to play for more than 200 hours this year. I never really got into Monster Train 1, but that's because I hadn't developed a crippling sickness when it came to card game roguelikes. But after Balatro, Cobalt Core, going back to Slay the Spire, I tried Monster Train 2 and it consumed maybe three months of my entire life It's just a really clever, super malleable card game. It's sort of like Magic the Gathering, but also lots of other things. And it also does this incredible thing halfway through the game where you've completed a few runs, you've leveled up, and then like a mid-season twist, it just unlocks almost all the characters, all the decks, all the clans from the original game. And I've just never seen a card game do something like that, just spring this huge surprise That changes basically how you play for the entire rest of your time with the game, which for me was hundreds of hours. Honestly, it blew my mind. And I don't know what that says about me. But you know, we move forward. Merry Christmas, happy holidays, keep doing good podcasts. I love you.

Matthew
25:24
A next award, most spectacular set piece.

Samuel
25:28
I think this has to go to the final sequence of split fiction, Matthew. Which cannot be ruined for the the the the listeners should get to experience it for themselves. But the final stretch that game is is great. I did want to throw in another split fiction set piece that I thought was amazing here, which I think is called a collapse. Where there's like a dying sun and it pulsates every few seconds and you have to jump between bits of cover. And for a second the game turns into like uh well for about ten minutes the game turns into basically like a an Xbox 360 sci-fi game and it's just really cool. See also the Star Fox bit they do in that game. Just really bold that these offcuts of game that feel like they started in like a game jam at that studio. And then get turned into something that really stands up to the different games that they're riffing on when they do that kind of set piece. You know, it's just an amazing game split fiction for that sort of thing. But what have you got, Matthew? I too picked the dying son in split fiction. Really? Yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah, I I did I did think this is a bit of a harder category to come up with this year because Not many of the games in the in the contention are really set PC games. Did you find that as well? There was that.

Matthew
26:38
I mean I I had a list of things from split fiction, you know, individual sequences, a lot of the side stories that I really liked. The only one other one I had written down for this was I quite liked some of the more scripted narrativey bits in Death Stranding too. There's a bit where you you're sort of whisked to a a different place than the traditional open world map. And you have to fight these soldiers in a almost looks like a sort of uh sort of Mexico sort of day of the dead. There's like all these fireworks going off and visually it's absolutely amazing like all these sparklers and sparks and just the particle effects are absolutely gorgeous. But then you have this sort of little fight against this military unit and it actually feels a little bit metal gear solid y, just fighting some like human soldiers in a urban environment. And you know, just for five minutes it gets you kind of excited for like, oh yeah, he is he's gonna do another one of these. You know, he is doing another tactical espionage style game and when he does switch into that mode, I think he's still got it. So yeah, it was sort between that and split fiction, which is just a game of set pieces, but brilliantly done.

Samuel

Yeah, for sure. And the kind of set pieces that games don't do as much these days as well. Very much that uncharted era of set piece. Like we made that naughty dog comparison when we talked about the game originally and it just you know, they are the best at doing it and they are doing it regularly as well. So yes, productivity as ever is valued greatly by the Backpage podcast and particularly Matthew Castle. Um I had a runner up as well actually, which is the Hellcarrier sections of Doom the Dark Ages, where you you land on these ships that are in the middle of these giant levels. And you like fight a load of enemies and you smash your shield through the heart of the ship, the ship explodes, and there's a transition and you're landing back on your dragon inside the level. Yeah. And that That looks amazing. I don't know if you got to that bit in the game. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great. So I thought that was really cool. So give them that a shout out as well. Next category then Matthew is best bit in a bad game. What have you got?

Matthew
28:38
I don't know if I played many like out and out honkers this year, so I felt like I had quite a short list of things to pick from. A game I didn't particularly like was uh Shoot and Order, which was the sort of visual novel adventure game anthology from Kadaka and the two Q team. It pitched itself as like this is five games in one, but they were all a bit rubbish. Apart from One portion of it is quite a simple detective game, pr present evidence to expose contradictions and all this. And you know, in itself it was quite nicely done, and the story of that section It's quite a nice riff on a Japanese crime story called The Inagumi Curse by Yokamizo. And I just quite like that. I quite like that they were drawing on something that I recognized and could do the Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme at but the rest of that game was a bit of a duffer. But that's okay because They made a two hundred hour visual novel strategy game that was excellent this year, so it's all right.

Samuel
29:40
That did happen. I look forward to that game coming up next week inevitably. I mean, I actually really thought that we'd both have the same one for this, which is You and I both why did we do we why did we request keys for the new Sonic racing game? Like what what was the thinking there? Because I played that for a whole morning with my little brother in split screen. And both of us looked at each other like, this is clearly not good, but we'll keep playing it. And like the the transformation between the different tracks is what I put here. Like it does seamlessly move from one track to another. And Which track it changes to. I think I say maybe in the control of the player, like it depends which way you go or something like that. But it means you'll go from like an afterburner track to a sonic track to to whatever it might be. And that is impressive in a game that I otherwise didn't think was very good. I think like, you know, for the kid who just cannot have Mario Kart because you bought a PS5 for the house and So therefore they cannot play Mario Kart World or whatever the the latest Mario Kart was called, cannot remember. You know, th this is available, but it's just not a very good racing game. Or even that funer party game. But you know, transforming tracks. It's a it's a cool novelty thing to hang the game off of, I guess, so I thought that made sense here, Matthew. Otherwise I thought I'd ask if there were any good bits to Nintendo's Switch 2 welcome tool that didn't get to, but I guess. Very droll. What did you think of that Sonic game in the end? Because we did never talk about it, but we did both play it, right? I thought it was quite hectic.

Matthew
31:07
The thing I I don't really like about any of those Sonic games is the It's the kind of crossover with Mario Kart. I just find its version of all the Mario Kart iconography very underpowered and just not as clean and simple. as like green shell, red shell, banana, etc. Just find it all it's all like a little bit more obnoxious and because I don't have the big Sega nostalgia thing, the way that it draws together all those different worlds and different characters doesn't really do anything for me.

Samuel
31:35
I I've got a bit of familiarity with that kind of thing, but I just Because of the type of 3D art that's in the game, it never feels like that blue sky Sega experience to me. It feels like a slightly synthetic version of it. Like it's slightly tacky cart game first and then the Sega part of it second. And so I didn't think it was um very good unfortunately, but alas, that's fine Matthew. What's the next category? It's worst bit in a great game. Okay, so the optional uh gestural climbing puzzles in Expedition 33. Ass. Um probably on purpose, and you only get I think optional outfits from doing them. Um, but they are like very tricky jumping puzzles in a game that does not have very good jumping or climbing mechanics because it doesn't need to for the most part, but then they boldly hang whole sections around them, and there's one that's towards the end of the game that is like Absolutely enormous and I had one go at it and then I just went no, no, and I just left and then never went back. And I think it is deliberate because I think they are riffing on Things like the Chocobo races in Final Fantasy X that you needed to get the ultimate weapon for Fatidus in that game. Right. And it was like notoriously a fucking ball lake. It was just an absolute nightmare. Uh I don't s I don't say bore like you very often 'cause it's very gendered uh and slightly kind of naughty kind of pub lad term, but I think I'll I do reserve it for final fancy turn. For a mini game that really just wants to kick you in the balls. I think it is appropriate. So um That's pretty bad. Runner up is the gliding sections in Shinobi, um Active Vengeance, which is a game I really like. Um but uh that just They they weren't good enough, um, unfortunately. Um and I think that dinged the reception of the game, genuinely, w which was otherwise fantastic. And then the management mini game in dispatch, which is not very good either, Matthew, but it's fine. It's just not amazing. But um what have you got what have you got?

Matthew
33:27
I've picked the handful of levels which I struggle to read visually in Luminez or Eyes. Oh, yes, a really good shout actually. Uh you know, which is a game I really like, and could very well make my top ten, maybe maybe at the closer to the ten end of things. But um it has a couple of levels that whenever they come up I sort of groan a bit because I'm like, oh god, here we go. There's a level where there's there's blocks with squares and X's in them, but the actual like design of the block is like universal, so they they just look a little bit too similar to me. There's ones where the two shapes are candles and lanterns, which I find really hard to read. And there's one with like we're halfway through the round. These little coloured blocks, these coloured orbs, turn into Earths and Moons, but the moon is like half in shadow and the earth is like animated and moving. And as a result, I'm like, I can't tell what's the background and what what what the blocks are.

Samuel
34:25
Yeah.

Matthew
34:26
And you have to be so on top of your shit in that game. 'Cause it's it's so hard and it goes so fast. There's just a couple of levels. This is just so obnoxious. I just wonder if they're all so good at playing Luminous or they played it so much that they didn't sort of see the transition into this impossible visual nightmare that that we've been left with. I like the maximalist style of it in most of the game, you know, I like how full on it is and you know, it's just a huge part of its DNA, but there's there's bits in it where I'm like, God, I'm I'm just too too fucking old for this. Yeah. I still have to try it in VR, which is that's gonna be the decider I think of like if it lives in the game of the year list.

Samuel
35:05
It's not gonna make it for me, but I think maybe we discuss that when we get to next week and um Because Inevitaby will come up somewhere might come up in on rule mentions or something. Um but yeah, I I agree. Like um it's the first game. Where I've ever turned on the accessibility settings because I can't read it well enough. Ca Like em th it's it's really crucial to understand where what those shapes are and I don't think it's an age thing. I think they genuinely are just too similar. And so I turned on the like I think it's like a shade background thing. And it fucks the art style, but it l allows you to see what you're actually doing. And if you want to finish those levels on normal difficulty, which is the setting I was playing on that you do need that level of visibility because otherwise yeah that it transitions so you're like, oh I'm suddenly at a disadvantage because I can't read this screen properly. And It's a bit of a bummer. So yeah, I think that's actually like a really good bit of criticism, Matthew, because it occurred to me too. But then I am also old, so um maybe that's what it is. Okay Um, the Chrono Trigger Award for most welcome remaster Matthew.

Matthew
36:07
I don't know if I played any good not not that I played any good remasters, if I played any substantial remaster enough to offer a a really good answer.

Samuel
36:18
Oh come on. I can think of one straight off the bat I've I've got Super Mario Galaxy 2 for this. That game was a little bit lost to you know, you had to go play it on a Wii U if you wanted to play it. And so I was very grateful. that they brought it back. I know there's some controversy over. Oh yeah.

Matthew
36:34
Oh that's a great shout. Oh, I guess remaster as well, you could have the Switch 2 editions of things. That's very true, like um Breath of the Wild and Tasting Kingdom. Oh how how did I manage to botch this up? Yes, this was one of the three I didn't have an answer for. Unfortunately it was seamless.

Samuel
36:52
No one would ever know. Um

Samuel
37:04
My least welcome was Kroc, by the way, they brought that back this year, so I thought it was a good idea. Well uh Matthew, on that note, I think we should have another guest appearance, don't you, to share their game of the year, so take it away.

Matt Leone
37:13
Hello Backpage Podcast. This is Matt Leone from Design Room, and I didn't play nearly enough games this year to feel like I can confidently pick the best one, but I really like Sword of the Sea from Giant Squid. It's an adventure game, kind of like Journey, where you spend most of the time surfing on a sword, which doesn't make a lot of sense, but feels incredibly smooth to play, doesn't overstay its welcome, and it seems like the kind of game that got overlooked this year because there was so much else going on. So I highly recommend it It told me I have a minute for this, so I also want to call out Capcom Fighting Collection 2, which is the kind of collection you only really get when you've already put all your bigger games at other compilations. But that's why I love it. It's a bunch of leftover 90s fighting games and it has the added bonus of being a nice send-off for Hideaki Itsuno, who's better known for Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma these days, but oversaw most of these games earlier in his career. It And then announced he was leaving Capcom just a few days after Capcom announced the collection. So yeah, it's great. Capcom vs SNK, Project Justice. Go check it out. Thanks.

Matthew
38:05
And we're back with the Portal Gun Award for Coolest Mechanic Exclusive to a Single Game.

Samuel
38:11
I mean, a shout out, the only award I'll give Atom for this year, which is not an amazing game, but definitely like a Uh like a a muscular 7 out of 10 was the metal detector was amazing in that game, particularly with the PS5 controller, like the feedback that you get from the rumble was really really good. So you could tell that the you know the developers in that how they implemented that, how you use it in the game and how it feels, it's so well thought out. And it's a it's a It's a non-combat mechanic that I found really memorable. So I know this is a tricky category to do, Matthew, but I kind of wanted to keep it in from last year just to really give this a shout out. I imagine that you I think you quite liked this too, didn't you?

Matthew
38:49
Definitely the best best bit of that game. And I remember us exchanging messages about the metal detector of like, Very dadly thing to do, sending that kind of message. Yeah. For this though, I have picked a puzzle game called Motion Wreck. One word. Wreck as in record. And the puzzle mechanic in this is that when you hold the left trigger and you move this little robot around platforming levels, it records the movements that he does And when you press the right trigger, it kind of plays back that movement from wherever you're now standing. And you basically have to use this to record yourself Pulling off moves and then playing those moves to get you through bits of a level. So for example, if you record yourself jumping up three platforms you can then play yourself rising in the air the height of three platforms where there aren't platforms, if that makes sense. Can you picture this game from what I just said? I about seventy-five percent, but it's like a bit it's a bit cloudy the picture in my head, you know? I'd heard about it and some people had said obviously it's got this really good central mechanic, but I in reading the reviews I was like, uh I don't know if I completely get that But when you do it, you're like, oh I get that, that's really smart. It's just a a a game where you have to sort of program the moves to solve a puzzle by recording yourself pulling off those moves elsewhere in the level. You just gotta trust me on this.

Samuel
40:17
Oh, okay. I I just watched a clip of it and I totally get what you mean now. So walk several steps forward. Save that and then if you need to cross a chasm, use that to cross the chasm later on.

Matthew
40:28
Yeah, to play yourself walking across the gap.

Samuel
40:30
Yeah, over the air. Yeah. That's a great, a great central mechanic for a game. I like that.

Matthew
40:34
Yeah, so um yeah that one's that one's quite fun. But just a nightmare to explain. Imagine if the Oscars were as chaotic as this and the winner goes to right, so you know that film about there's like a guy with a spoon and um Nevermike what yeah that is true. A metal detector was much easier to explain. The metal detector from an atom fall Very clean to read out at the Oscars.

Samuel
41:00
I keep waiting for you to find an award to put collecting animals for churches and death drowning two into. Because I feel like that's just the perfect kind of fodder for this episode, but I can't work out what the award would be. So uh yeah, I don't know. I guess we'll see Matthew. Okay, best hub world um slash area or best level Matthew, what have you got? Be

Matthew
41:19
Well I've picked an area from Hell is Us called Lake Sinon. Which I don't know if you got to. It's just like the really beautiful bit of countryside where like the war hasn't touched it. Yeah. It's quite a grim game that and the first two areas are just sort of like Here's the countryside destroyed by civil war and there's just bodies and demons everywhere. And then you suddenly get to this field of flowers on a lake. And there's this amazing waterfalls in the distance. And it's like a triumph of background environment art. You're looking at this beautiful level and I just think i it's more the way that it follows such like ugliness. It it feels like the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in a game. Um which you know it probably isn't s put put a alongside some other things, but uh Yeah, the psychological effect of it is is really excellent.

Samuel
42:07
Another good blue sky post by Andy Kelly. He compared it to uh like a town from the Witcher. or something. Maybe like a blood and wine sort of vibe to it. Yeah. Which I definitely think it y you're right, the contrast as well elevates it. I just got to this area basically. That's how far I got with it. It does look really nice. I like I think that's a really good choice. And again, nice to shout that game out, which will no doubt be in all of the end-of-the-year sales um sure ahead of us. Um so yeah. I've picked Bluegate from the game Artgraders, Matthew, which I talked about with Phil Savage a little bit. It's a very Mediterranean feeling, like set of hills with a bunch of like sort of antiquated like a sm there's like a a couple of different villages in it that sort of look like you're exploring the countryside in Spain or Italy or something. Very beautiful houses. And then there's like a an olive grove over like one field and it's just really picturesque. It like looks like something from Escape to the country or something like that. Like it's just really the thing is there's some really like a couple of really dreary maps in Arcraders, and again it might be a contrast thing. There's a map called Damn Battlegrounds. in the same game, which is like um having a school trip to the town sewer works. It's like it's just really like this arid land surrounding this big, like boring grey building. that you go in and like it's such a labyrinth to go through that you feel like you never see anything else in that map and that's not a good time but by comparison blue gate I feel like the surroundings mellows people out. Like I we always have the fewest combat encounters with other other squads there. It's got this massive Underground military base. Absolutely cavernous. Like when you're on top of the hill, you sort of see a gap, you look down, and it goes down like it must go down like a hundred feet or something. It goes really deep down, then you can Sort of rope down or take a staircase down and there's like a good loot to find there, but it's just really atmospheric. And then there's a very Walking Dead style abandoned freeway area that is patrolled by robots And it's like one of the coolest maps to have like the really big stumpy robots in, like the Matriarch, just the silhouette of like a kaiju sized robot on this map. It's just like it's just really amazing. On some level, the success of this game has to come down to how it looks. You know, it is um Patrick Sodelin, so X-Dice people who kind of know what or like a know how to sell a multiplayer game with good looks. So yeah, I re I really like Bluegate. I I think if they make more maps in this vein, I think the game will have a really good future. Yeah, not all of the maps are up to this this standard. There's also a spaceport level where you just endlessly get sniped by dickheads who are on these big towers and launch platforms for spaceships. Yeah, Bluegate man is beautiful. Though I really love the Olive Grove. That's just constantly people just like kicking trees to like pick fruit and take olives. Did I tell the story of how I dropped the lemon out of panic because I thought someone was gonna shoot me? Did I tell you about that? Yeah, so basically like because you can have voice comms on. And I just never turn mine on because I just don't. I just use the the pre-program commands like don't shoot and that sort of thing. And some this woman came up to me and was just like, um, what fruit are you looking for? And she said it in a way where I thought she was gonna shoot me. And I'd just been like kicking this tree and getting these lemons, and I just like took out these lemons and just chucked them at her feet and ran away just because I thought she was about to shoot me on site. And that's the kind of interaction you can have there. But she was actually just wanted to trade um the fruit that she had. And um Yeah, I don't know. It's like uh the it's a fine line in that game between absolute humans at their worst and Animal Crossing, and somehow those two things coexist um at once, and I think Bluegate sums it up Better than anything else the game.

Matthew
45:45
So yeah, I know Artgrader's probably a perplexing game from this year to you, Matthew, probably quite impenetrable to hear about, but um every time you explain it to me, I understand it a little bit more. Like I'm an AI model. That's gradually learning what Art Raders is just through other people's anecdotes. So I'll be able to talk about it convincingly.

Samuel
46:03
Yeah, Castle LLM. Um it's really um taking off. Uh okay Matthew, next category. Best boss fight. Yeah, a brief answer for this one. It's probably Lu Bu in Dynasty Warriors Origins. Oh, that's good. Because you played the bit where he chases you, right? Oh that is what I'm thinking of. Yeah, I've not actually fought the guy. Well that's the that's the great thing that so when he's introduced, it's basically like Some heavy motherfucker who sat on a throne going, right, now to bring in my lap dog. Lu boo, and you're like, oh fuck, here he is, Mr. Disney Warriors himself. And then it basically you have to escape the map because Lu Boo is fucking everyone up so badly. And it's a really good narrative turn in that game. But later on, you do actually you finally have your sort of like proper encounter with him. And first he's on horseback, then he's on foot. And it's just like the it's the only time the game ever goes full Sekiro. You need to like parry each attack perfectly. And it's so demanding, but To crack it, to actually beat him was really rewarding because you feel like a boss battle with Lu Bu it has to live up to to that. If you're gonna do proper combat mechanics as they have in this game, then it really just needs to deliver, and I think it does. So that one I had another one from a different game, Matthew, but um I actually thought you might pick the other game, so I thought I'd I'd leave it, but what have you got for this?

Matthew
47:23
Uh I've actually picked the uh octopus monster from Monster Hunter Wilds. Oh, okay. No, that's not what I thought you'd pick, but go ahead. I mean Monster Hunter Wilds is is just like a you know a campaign of sixteen boss fights, as is the Monster Hunter Way, but uh this was one of the new monster types. I don't think they've done a you know, multi-tentacled thing before. And just as a bit of technical execution, seeing this like writhing, horrible thing kind of come sliming out of the heart of this volcano I feel like I've seen so many variations on so many different monsters in Monster Hunter over the years, but I hadn't seen anything quite like that. And that just made it a thrill to sort of hack away at it and not a game that I stuck with and and played loads, but I also want to recognise that it did give me plenty of thrills along the way and and I think that was that was Probably like the highlight of the campaign for me.

Samuel
48:19
Oh, interesting. See, I was convinced you would pick uh something from a certain Nintendo platformer this year, but I wonder if maybe you're back pocketing that for a different episode, Matthew. But um Well, I guess we'll see. But that's nonetheless a good choice. That's the thing that that game, you know, the the that series does incredibly well. And uh yeah, you know, the animations, uh how they how they look and move is spectacular. So yeah, that's a that's a good choice. I like that. I think we uh both slightly unusual picks there, I think, for the year. Okay, um shall we have another guest pop in here, Matthew? Yeah, let's do it. Who's that coming up the path?

Dave Jewitt
48:55
Hello Matt and Sam, it's me, Dave, and I want to tell you about one of my personal favourite games of the year and a title that I think at the very least deserves RPG of the year, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. It's such an ambitious RPG. It should be in the same conversation as things like Baldur's Gate 3. There's really no experience like the Kingdom Come Deliverance games and the sequel nails everything that the original was going for, improves on it to no end. It's got incredible quests. ranging from historically authentic battles and events with rich characters taken from Czech history to to much more light-hearted ones. There are very few games where the first act would have you drunkardly stumbling your way through schmoozing people at a wedding and then hours of epic adventure later have you having a real moral quandary as to whether or not you should eat your dog that's been your companion for the entire game because everyone is starving to death in a siege. And all of it makes sense and it's cohesive within the same game because it spans so much emotion, so many stories. And I've not even touched upon the Sword fighting, how great the armor looks, the how authentic the world is. In terms of authentic video games, and as a bit of a history nerd myself. Few do it as well as Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. And while it might not be for everyone, I think it is an exceptional RPG and deserves at least a nod for Game of the Year.

Samuel
50:39
Oh, thanks for stopping by, whoever that was. And uh I really appreciate it. Next category then, Matthew, is uh the Yoko Shimamura Award for a total banger. So rewarding music in a game Again, a bit less easy to pass than the Oscars, um these ones, when you have to explain what the awards are, but um what have you got?

Matthew
50:57
It's pretty niche, but I've been listening to it a lot uh these last couple of weeks. I'm picking a track from Birdcage. Hmm, yes, which I just finished yesterday. Uh specifically the music from level five, which is a cool level because you get a different ship, is introduced and uh with a slightly different mechanic. This is a a shoot 'em up for people who haven't heard of it. The music's fantastic throughout, but this particular level I'll I'll play a bit so you can hear it, but it's got this absolutely rad sort of like wailing saxophone and then it's got a little bit that really sounds like Castlevania and It just gets you so pumped in the moment and you know, this particular ship you've just unlocked, uh it basically benefits from you grazing bullets. You have to sort of steer it as close to bullets as possible and the sort of thrill of that combined with this like daredevil music, it's it's just an absolutely like fantastic moment by of course backpage composer. Barry topping. It's just so good this soundtrack. It's absolutely brilliant.

Samuel
52:33
Yeah, I uh I thought the music was fantastic in this. It's a it's almost like a reason to play the game alone because it's a two it's a two-person project basically. And so it's like it's almost worth just playing the levels to hear the music while you play the levels because they do sync up so well. Which is an odd way odd way to recommend a game but Yeah, it's great. What I love about Barry's music is that it's exactly as good as what inspired it. You know what the DNA is, but the it's you know it's not imp just imitation. It's like it's it's as good. Um Which is really the best um you can say. You could argue that we're not objective about this as the composer of our theme tune, but um I really do mean it. So uh yeah.

Matthew
53:16
Yeah, I just hope sort of even even greater things um lie down the line because it's just uh it's just awesome this music.

Samuel
53:24
Absolutely. Um so I think this is where I have to select Claire Obscure Expedition 33. So Gonna pick the um flying waters um theme um from the game, which it's my favorite bit of the game in terms of how it looks, that g uh that that bit, but Also how it sounds as well. I just think the music's brilliant. And then the boss fight from that section, um, which is called Rain from the Ground. Um the both those pieces of music as a pair. There's like a bit in that boss theme where the elec like an electro beat kicks in and you're like, fucking yeah, let's go in a in a way that just really um Suits uh uh like a Japanese RPG battle where you want to have that feeling of escalation. You know, it's something that Final Fantasy games do so well, the boss battle music is always amazing in those games and so Yep, um Lorian Testard did a great job, so uh yes, it's a really obvious pick, Matthew, but uh wanted to give it a shout out for sure.

Matthew
54:43
I also wanted to give it a little nod to uh there's a bit in is it Sword in the Sea or Sword of the Sea The one where you're skating around the desert on a big sword, that one. Didn't mind it. I d I I thought it was a little sort of like nimbly bimbly. Um but uh it is beautiful and it sounds beautiful. The soundtrack's amazing. There's a bit in it where you turn in Theme tune as you sort of chomp crystals in the desert, that's pretty good.

Samuel
55:49
Uh if you out there know the difference between La D Dar and Nimbly Bimbly, please get in touch. Um, because I'm still trying to figure it out as we go recording this podcast with Matthew, but um Yeah, that's a good shout. That's a game I want to play because I know it's not very long.

Matthew
56:01
It is beautifully made. None of that kind of game are like my all-time favourite games, you know? I I sort of admire them rather than love them.

Samuel
56:09
They're for the PlayStation people, aren't they, Matthew, those games. Um the people And that you're not they're not your people, that's the thing. For people who had PS3s and downloaded all the PSN games and played Flower and Journey, that's just not your life, you know.

Matthew
56:22
So uh it's funny 'cause I uh inherited uh Catherine's PC at some point. And so my desktop background has been Abzu for about as long as I can remember. That's funny. Okay. Alright, well let's um move on to the next category, Matthew. A non hitman game location that would make a great hitman level.

Samuel
56:39
So I really struggled with this, as mentioned. And I eventually concluded that the town square in Ecuador where everyone is watching football in Despelote Would be pretty good. It's got like a video store. It's got people like having like a little kickabout, admittedly kids, some of them. It's got like little restaurants and bars. And it's got like a real feeling of a place. And you also get the titman thing of like time moving on. Who you kill there is a bit more up for debate. Um but I eventually came to the conclusion that of course Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a perfect hitman level. Because it's basically a load of like booze and people walking around and people at stations where you could take their jobs. And so that just occurred to me when we started recording that Of course, that's the perfect place to have Agent 47 going around. Like, I need you to go kill I need you to go kill the guy. Who does the frame rate test over there, take his uniform? I think that's perfect.

Samuel
57:43
But what have we got for this map? Oh, that's funny. Um but yeah, I thought that was perfect, but I struggled with this category right up until we recorded this episode. But uh That is great.

Matthew
57:51
Switch two welcome tour, it's like minimalist enough as a museum that it would actually suit that kind of refined world of Hitman quite nicely. Yeah, it really would. Uh so yeah, yeah. I'm glad you agreed that was a good fit. Cause I love a good uh hitman nightclub or night spot level. So I picked the groove layer of Donkey Kong Bonanza. The groove tones are playing a concert, you've got to murder Void Kong i that's the level it's got elements which can like change their element when you hit a tuning or not when you hit a tuning for it, there's something you hit and then gold becomes rubber and rubber becomes gold. So I could see Agent forty seven having some fun with like some materials that become other materials when he so chooses, you know?

Samuel
58:35
Yeah. I think he would be like, what the fuck is going on? I mean I think it It would be told like you've got to kill Void Cog. I think it'd be like, What am I doing with my life?

Matthew
58:43
Well also everyone in that level is like a two foot tall piece of blue crystal. And it's gonna be very, very hard. Like when he does the social stealth through the crowd when he's at the fractones. concert. It's just gonna be so obvious what he's up to because he's the one who isn't a crystal.

Samuel
59:00
Yeah I did yeah uh the practicality of that perhaps needs some work but you know his greatest challenge yet Um even harder than Eminem, Mila Jovovich, or Bruce Lee, Matthew. So um yes. Um okay, so next category. Game I played for ten minutes on Game Pass, and no more than that. Not every game on Game Pass. You know, it's gonna be something you play for 20 hours. And so I've always got one for this every year, but what have you got, Matthew?

Matthew
59:26
Uh I've got I think this came out this year, Lost Records, Bloom and Rage Oh yeah, yeah. Was that the um don't nod thing? Yes. About well, from the opening ten minutes, some girls. That's it. That's what I've got.

Samuel
59:43
Yeah, I um I had Marvel Cosmic Invasion, which there's no point to playing that game in a year with Absalom and Shinobi. You are well taken care of for games that riff on side-scrolling beat-em-up. Unless you really just need to have Tony Stark beating people up in the street and not like other characters. If you non-IP characters, then it felt like the easiest one to skip to me. I was like, this is a bit uh by the numbers compared to those two games so didn't exceed 10 minutes for me there Matthew um alas okay next one Matthew best tip we can offer to improve any one game It's a bit a bit controversial, Matthew, but I think that Absalom's roguelike structure should be more generous than it is. And I think it wastes your time at a certain point. I think like I think it I think it's like something I read it's something like 20 hours the game or something like that or it's a like a long it's like longer than it maybe should be and I felt like I thought those same few bosses without anything interesting happening for a bit a few too many times. It actually like bummed me out a bit as a roguelike structure eventually and I just and I just stopped playing it. I abandoned it. Which, you know, I was having a good time with it, but I was like, I'm sick of this bar, I'm sick of fighting this one big this this one big bloke, I'm sick of fighting this guy who knocks these rocks from the from the roof, and I could see it. peeling back the layers. Like I got to that misty island up north and I thought, Oh, I haven't been here before, but I feel like I waited a bit too long for the game to decide I was allowed to have this bit. And there is a tension in that game, I think, between the the skill you have as a player and what you're able to achieve with your character based on their like power level and like what where the game wants you to be sort of relative to how much you've played it. And I think that it just I I think I've Yeah, I think that could stand to be a bit more generous, but I know you like this game more than me, so what do you think of that?

Matthew
01:01:37
Just my journey through it was was so pleasant and well paced, and I don't know if that was because we just lucked out or playing with Catherine like co-op the whole thing, you know, then if any of it does like wane, you know, you've just got the n the natural safety net of It's fun playing a game with a f with someone else there who you can chat to and you can kinda gloss over that stuff. So maybe that helps in in that case. Yeah. 'Cause it's weird because uh you know, i it it's a structure I feel myself the everything's a rogue like now. I I feel myself actually like pushing back against a little bit more this year and sort of resisting some of the more popular games in that genre, but this one did make the cut and I do wonder if it is pu purely because of the co op thing. Like I have I haven't played it single player, I've only played it co-op and for me it's just that experience. So maybe I do need to like play a bit by myself and see if that changes things. Or maybe I'll just keep it banked as that. Excellent co-op experience.

Samuel
01:02:39
I think keep it banked. If you had a really good time with it, it's not typically a genre that you dabble with, then yeah. I mean I got to the ten hours mark and I feel like I was getting there with getting one character done. But then when I looked at the progression for all the other characters, I was just a bit like, uh I just it just felt a bit too much like work for me. Um but then maybe not playing it a single player would have would have helped that Otherwise, yes, they should, in those gliding sections of Shinobi, make the spiky corridor tunnels be a bit less fucking bullshit with the hitboxes. Yeah, exactly. But what have you got for this?

Matthew
01:03:13
Uh I mean I don't know if it's necessarily a tip for the game maker as opposed to people playing this game, but I wanted to tell people who were gonna play the hundred line and maybe the developers could factor this into how they sort of set the game up and explain it. But if you go in not knowing about that this game becomes this huge branching narrative thing, 'cause it sort of sells itself as like a where you're playing this scenario through. And as a result, I think you take it maybe more seriously as a strategy game on that first run through, like being very careful, like working up your characters you know, trying to level up the right people, investing in the upgrades, buying sort of customizable items and all this and I I think my initial playthrough of that game was a bit slowed down and a bit bogged down in like min-maxing it and actually When you realise I have got this like two hundred hour thing to play, you realise that well I I'm gonna be gradually chipping away at all these improvements over the course of those two hundred hours. Yeah. You just don't need to take it as seriously that first time round. That's what I wish I'd known. You're not gonna restart this every time. Like everything you've unlocked and earned is gonna be there on every run, so Just take it as this cumulative thing and I think you'll probably shave, you know, maybe ten hours off your first that that first storyline 'cause you're not

Samuel
01:04:34
Like thinking about grinding for like upgrade materials and stuff like that. I think that's a really good tip because I do think a lot of people are gonna play it. who listen to this podcast based on your recommendation and discussion of it throughout the year. So ten hours back is no doubt welcomed by the uh the dads who listen to this. Yeah, maybe ten hours is too much, but like Thereabouts. Yeah. You just pass the game differently if you look at it that way, I guess. Yeah. Okay. Good stuff, Matthew. Should we have another guest pop in? Yeah, let's do it.

Lucy
01:05:05
Hi Samuel and Matthew, it's Lucy, the developer behind One Night Stunt and Video Verse. I'm here again to talk about my favourite game of 2025. It's Promise Mascot Agency. So I'm a big fan of Kaizen Gameworks ever since I played Paradise Killer and I bought this one on day one. Promise Mascot Agency is a fun blend of Japanese culture and British humour. I had a great time with it. It has a fantastic cast of voice actors from Takea Kuroda who is Kiru from the Yakuza series all the way to Shuhei Yoshida. I loved cruising around Kazamachi in the little K truck, picking up trading cards, upgrades, and knocking down the mayor's campaign signs. It's chill, it's funny, and it's rebellious. I love finding and befriending all the mascots as well and the writing is hilarious. If you've had enough of crusty old geezers running the country, then this is a game for you. And the soundtrack by Alpha Chrome Yao is fantastic. I've been listening to it non-stop since I finished the game, and I think I'm like one of the top listeners in the world now or something. So anyway, thanks again for another year of podcast guys and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Samuel
01:06:18
Back we are Matthew. The oh my god I hope no one walks in while I'm playing this award. Brackets can be for prudish or cringe reasons. What have you got? The opening fight of dispatch with that naked green guy Oh yeah, the dick, the big dick that's in in the game.

Matthew
01:06:32
That or the horse penises in baby steps. Oh, those are good shouts actually, yeah. I'd be equally embarrassed if there was female nudity in my game, but But this was a year where though I just don't really remember any major moments of that, but it was a very big penis year.

Samuel
01:06:50
Nudity's still one of those things that probably because of the amount of American games publishers and America's really weird about nudity. Not weird about guns, of course, people getting shot in the head, but you know, nudity. Uh seeing abreast on TV almost broke that nation during the Bush administration. So, you know, I guess like video games they just still can't really do nudity um that much. But male nudity is still like when used appropriately or inappropriately, can be used as sort of like physical comedy, and I suppose that's what they were going for in both cases.

Matthew
01:07:19
But um Yeah.

Samuel
01:07:20
More a bit unsettling I found in both cases actually, the presence of a dick. I don't think I I don't think I liked it, to be honest. What was the game you were playing when the plumber came around. Oh that was God of War 3 remastered. That's one of the all-time great Matthew Castle stories that. Oh yeah, so for me this was probably Experimenting with the different swimsuit outfits in Expedition 33. Just sort of like, they're all quite like sort of Victorian-era swimsuits. They're not like hugely revealing, but it's still a moment of like This is not not the best. Um it's just see also the bonus outfits in Persona 5. You just don't want to be anyone to walk in. while you're exploring those menus and that was still the case here.

Matthew
01:08:04
I had that in Zenoblay Chronicles definitive edition came out. They added the feature where The clothes you wore i in game w weren't necessarily the clothes you had equipped. You could equip like stats clothes and then just visual cosmetic clothes and So I had them all wearing like amazing armors, but in person they were just all wearing swimming costumes and it looked super dodgy.

Samuel
01:08:26
Oh, I d do you know what? After th last week's episode with Lucy, I went and looked up that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 picture. And like, do you know what? It didn't disappoint from how it was discussed in that episode. It really It really delivered what I wanted from that picture without spoiling it for people. I just couldn't quite believe I was like, well that that happened. There's so much debate about what is going on in that picture.

Joe
01:08:48
Is he functioning?

Samuel
01:08:51
Yeah, I went down a a receta rabbit hole with it just to see what people were saying about it. Like it was yeah, genuinely a fascinating um object um from Nintendo history that it should be in it should be a Smash Bros power up in the next one of those. That'd be good. Okay. Um okay, where were we? Um oh this is the all right.

Matthew
01:09:11
Yeah we've got The I Wish You Well award for a game we acknowledge is good while choosing not to participate. Power Wash Simulator 2. No thank you, but I wish you well. What have you got Matthew? Arc Raiders. No thank you, but I wish you well. Also, rematch. No thank you. But I wish you well. Excellent stuff. Most cursed, Matthew. I had a quite a literal sort of like horror-cursed reading of this, which was the Silent Hill F. level with like the three rituals was quite like full on and gnarly. But in terms of being like a more cursed artifact, and maybe actually this could qualify for the oh my god, I hope no one walks in while I'm playing this award Pirate Yakuza has like a FMV side quest where the the chef of your boat looks for love. and dates all these women, but it's it's you know, with him as a flesh and blood actor with other human actresses put in a bar and you have to sort of f watch him sort of flirt with them and it's like a step up from those videos of like the models having bubble baths. It's like a guy sort of like being all kind of creepy and sort of poring at them and They've got an incredibly cursed energy and it's like a section that in my head lasted for about an hour. I don't know if that's true, but it was like watching an hour of a really horny reality TV show embedded as a side quest in Pirate Yakuza. So

Samuel
01:10:39
That was pretty cursed. That is cursed. I put Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 because that guy's tweets. That makes that that makes that quite cursed for me. That is cursed for me.

Matthew
01:10:46
That that one is such a bummer, because I actually quite like that game. And maybe people will think that's like you know, fickle or uncompromised in some way for like liking something but denying myself that for some sort of grudge. But um you He sent like the worst bits of Twitter off to my wife, so Biggest existential crisis triggered.

Samuel
01:11:06
I have a really good answer for this one. What have you got?

Matthew
01:11:08
Don't know if this was truly existential, but not really enjoying blippo and not finding blippo funny when everyone on the internet was saying it was absolutely hilarious Made me worried that I'm just too much of a normie to sort of enjoy interesting comic art these days. See also the work of Tim Robinson in twenty twenty five. Also, um thank goodness you're here. Yeah, it's just been a b it's been a bad bad year for me, like not really enjoying things that other people find really funny, and it makes me feel like a bit of a sort of boring old bastard. So it genuinely an existential crisis.

Samuel
01:11:46
I I guess a really good answer actually, 'cause I mean, I will say you put me off Blippo Plus so much that you sent me a key for it and I still not redeemed it because of my head I'm like Oh, it's gonna be tough this. But you're right, I do see a lot of people saying it's it's good. But I think I think it's because everyone out there is determined to think they're like an alternate comedy fan. So they can't they can't bear the uh they can't bear the idea that they might find something like Big Bang Theory funny or something. So they're like, I'll go all in on this thing that's not funny at all.

Matthew
01:12:18
One of my uh favourite episodes of Simon Parkins podcast this year was the one of the co-creators of Blippo was on that and she was great. Like she was a really good guest and I really you know, I I really liked what she said and connected with what a lot of she said and I think that's okay. Just a different sense of humor. It's fine. It's fine, right? It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

Samuel
01:12:38
So my answer to this one is uh I had a fall in baby steps, uh the first area that to that took me all the way back to the very start of the level. And lost about probably about like 45 minutes progress, something like that. And I was so angry, I deleted my save and started the game again. Like from scratch. Even though that was like It is it achieved nothing to do so. That is the ultimate Samuel Roberts anecdote. The thing the th the The thing is I actually ri I I don't think I'm gonna get to finish it in time for the game of the year episode, but I think it is actually like a pretty good game. Like the actual mechanics are so honest in terms of how they work. It's it's all about like it's it is one to one what it's like supposed to be. It's not an unfair game. But I was so angry when I slipped on like a wet rock and my guy went tumbling down this stream. I was just like, f fuck this.

Matthew
01:13:34
Did you did you say anything out loud or was it just like a silent oh uh just talk me through the moment, like how quickly did you go from like full to like

Samuel
01:13:42
turning it off and deleting the save or was it were you vocal throughout or I would say it was a bit of a like you know that Kendall Roy meme where you're sort of staring into the distance? I would say it was a bit of that kind of existential despair. Like it was less It wasn't like fury. It was like cold despair. Cold despair.

Matthew
01:13:59
And then you rationally came to the conclusion I have to delete the save to somehow injure the game.

Samuel
01:14:06
Basically. And then I started again and did the whole section perfectly. I got to the I got past the look the first mountain bit. And you know where the the second area properly starts, basically. I got to that. So I don't think it's possible to fall back to the start again now. I think because you're in a different area.

Matthew
01:14:22
Maybe I'm wrong, but um no, I can I can I can sort of uh sympathize with that. I've definitely I've had moments where you're just so angry with something that you're like, I just have to pack this away so I can never ever do it again. Like remove the game, put it back in its box. put it on the shelf. I won't throw it, but uh you know put it back on its shelf and just pack it away. It's gone for good. Where it can never hurt me, yes.

Samuel
01:14:46
Um okay. What a 2025 we've had. Yeah, I know what a year. Should we have another guest here, Matthew? Yeah, let's do it.

Ash
01:14:57
Hello, Samuel and Matthew. Ashley Day here, fresh off my landslide victory in the 16-bit draft and feeling good. My favourite game of 2025 is the 100line Last Defence Academy. As you know, my favourite genre of game is tack So to have a great new tactics RPG out there in 2025, and one that mixes in visual novel elements from the genre masters, Kodaka and Uchikoshi. That was a real treat for me. Um I had high expectations for this game uh and they they were exceeded. Um the tactical combat is excellent. It genuinely innovates with the way movement and attacks work. If it had been a tactics game alone, I think it would still be my game of the year. But of course the story is absolutely riveting as as you'd expect from these creators and the uh the time travel element of the story really makes this game excel Much like near Automata, if you only play this game once, you're only really seeing a fraction of what this game has to offer. You you won't understand the the true story if you only play through the first uh 100 days. Uh I'd say two hundred days is recommended. And you won't regret it. I I've enjoyed comparing the story that I saw through through the choices that I made in the game. with those stories that my friends have seen and the differences have been truly wild. Uh some crazy, crazy things happen in this game and it it is uh laden with uh shocks and and plot twists. Uh you know, a a real treat for for visual novel fans, I think. So I intend to keep playing it. I'd I'd love to play some more and see some some more of the endings, some more of the story branches. So if I get time, I think I'll be playing uh even more of the hundred line in 2026. Uh so maybe it'll be next year's Game of the Year too. Anyway, that's all for now. Um goodbye everyone. Um thanks for having me on the show this year. It's been it's been a real pleasure. I hope you guys and all of the backpage listeners, or at least the ones who vote for me in the drafts Have a fantastic Christmas and a happy new year. Goodbye.

Matthew
01:17:17
I really hope it was someone saying they love Blippo. Or baby steps, that'd be good. Next up is the I've Thought of a New Recipe Award for Best Virtual Food. I think last year we debated whether or not he said recipe in the way that I've written it down in Final Fantasy uh fifteen.

Samuel
01:17:33
Is it too dated a reference now that as a nine-year-old game and I wonder if like it's lost to time a little bit as a thing.

Matthew
01:17:39
I've thought of a new recipe.

Samuel
01:17:40
Yeah, I mean it's a it's a great bit of dialogue. Uh Matthew actually wanted to Access Cat 'cause he didn't think there were enough good suggestions. But then I I threw a few at him and I think there were actually plenty. But I think um Blue Prince wins this. You got loads of great food and it all looks pretty tasty. It's rendered into that 3D cell-shaded style. Got lemon glazed salmon. You got beef stew pie. You got porterhouse steak. Wood-fired pizza. Or the opulent Samuel Roberts favorites. Matthew's sort of like rebadging of me is like the posh one of the duo. It's the most disingenuous fucking narrative of this podcast. Like can I just say that's unbelievable that that's happened. All because I buy salmon for £3. 89, the cheapest salmon they do at Sainsbury's, like once every two weeks. Unbelievable. Can we assume that the protagonist of Blueprints du doesn't eat that day if he doesn't draw a dining room in the layout of the house? Because seems like it's pretty pivotal to his diet, um that room.

Matthew
01:18:39
But um, but I think it's implied that he's got 'Cause he's camping outside the house, right?

Samuel
01:18:44
And I guess there's food in the tent. Yeah, I guess so. Pro plus he finds the odd banana or whatever. But yeah, I think Blue Prince has good food, Matthew. What have you got?

Matthew
01:18:52
You are right. Uh after I tried to get rid of this, you reminded me that like every game had amazing food this year. I've picked the giant square watermelons from the resort layer of Donkey Kong Bonanza.

Samuel
01:19:04
Oh yeah, that's a good one. They those do look pretty tasty.

Matthew
01:19:06
Yeah, and they've got buttons on them and then when you hit them the fruit explodes. What I loved about it is I mean giant fruit is obviously, you know, you can't be a 10 out of 10 3D platformer without giant fruit somewhere in the mix. But having giant fruit But then they're also slightly weird shapes. And there's like a a mechanic to easily explode them. That's exciting. I mean really Nintendo taking their giant fruit to the next level.

Samuel
01:19:31
I did think about putting in the uh The bananas from Donkey Kong Bananza. I w I w I wouldn't mind a little nibble on a on a crystal banana just to see what it's like. Yeah, just bite into it.

Matthew
01:19:41
Not with my incredibly brittle teeth. Your teeth would be fine. If I tried explaining that to the dentist, it's like Knowing how cross he was when I told him I broke a tooth on a Maoam. If I went back to him and said, Uh yeah, I ate a crystal banana over Christmas and it shattered my two front teeth. It's just not worth it. I mean he'd take the he'd take the business, wouldn't he? Oh yeah, absolutely. You're you're you're you're you're a great get. My mouth is a gold mine. Basically, yeah. It's a richer gold mine than the gold mine at the start of Donkey Kong Bonanza.

Samuel
01:20:14
All the patrons doing at this point is paying Matthew's dental bills. So uh yeah, it's perfect really. Yeah, so I wouldn't mind a nibble on that. I still think it'll taste like rock more than like glass. Well I guess we'll never know. It's fictional game, Matthew. Next category then. Least satisfying side content, Matthew. What have you got?

Matthew
01:20:29
I put down the naval battles from Pirate Yakuza for this. Mm-hmm. And um some of them you have to do for side quests, but a lot of them are just to sort of slow you down on your way to things. It's like a quite a silly arcadey version of the already quite silly and arcadey Assassin's Creed Black Flags, but I thought it was just a little rougher around the edges to the point where After like five of them, the cuteness of it wore off and I really really resented having to fight like any pirates in that game. A game I've maybe like called on generally. Uh uh across the year. What's really happened? A little bit too frivolous, not enough sort of meat on the bones. I don't think they necessarily did enough to disguise the reuse of certain things, even though they've added all this pirate ship and pirate monarchy, which has never been in there before. For some reason it feels a little bit more sort of recycled and tired than some of the games which are more visually similar to the previous ones. So I don't really know what happened there. I hope it's just a like a a wobble, you know? And that then the the next three games or whatever it is they're releasing in twenty twenty six are all gonna be bangers.

Samuel
01:21:36
Well you can't really get Yakuza 3 with some extra bits added on wrong, can you? That seems like it's a pretty depends if those extra bits are naval battles. That is true. I guess we'll have to see there. But uh Yeah, I think that's a fair shout, Matthew. Dynasty Warriors Origins clinches this for me. It's a bit too flabby, that game. I feel like I've put this in about nine different categories now. I think it took me something like sixty, seventy hours to finish in the end, and it does have really good big battle story missions with like proper set PC moving parts to make it feel like the tide of battle is turning and uh basically delivering everything you could ever really want from a Dynasty Warriors game. But then It just has these repeated bits in between you have to do to level up or get certain things or make the game move forward or bits of side quests that don't really add up to much. And Really, if it was just all those big battles back to back, it'd be about twenty hours shorter, but a much better game. So um yes, that that's the uh that's the pick there, Matthew. And we move on to Worst Discourse. Oh, video game budgets. Oh god. Especially around Claire Obscure Expedition 33. Like, no one knows what the budgets of games are because no publishers release the data. So why are you arguing about it? You don't know what you're comparing. That drove me nuts this year, because on LinkedIn There was every like fake expert motherfucker was weighing in with takes on this and like they all act like, oh yeah, I saw this coming actually and it's like, no you didn't. You didn't fucking know what Claire Obscure was till two weeks ago. And all those people can go in the bin. Like worst discourse by far. Hated hearing about it. There's no best discourse, by the way, but I thought all of the subnautica 2 stuff this year was wild. Like that made me think that actually There are no adults anywhere, and that everyone involved is like a child and like it was so ridiculous the back and forth on it. It's been great drama that. So um I enjoyed that, Matthew. Well have you got any take on game budgets and and what's your pick for this?

Matthew
01:23:31
Uh I don't really have any spicy takes on game budgets. Because I've never had to talk about games, you know, on a website, you know, where you have to have something new to say about them every day. Like it's just not really a place my brain's ever had to go to. You know, I can connect with games as little or as much as I like. And yeah, I can just remember years ago Tim Schaefer saying, Oh just don't worry, stop worrying about how much my games are sold. Just stop worrying about it. That's like that's the thing I worry about. It's got like nothing to do with you, don't worry about it. And uh yeah, I've always felt slightly like that, even though it's just yeah, it is a huge part of the discourse, but not for me.

Samuel
01:24:09
What do I know about that stuff, you know? Yeah, fair enough, Matthew. I think you're uh as ever, you focus on the games themselves, which is uh the way to do it. But here's a here's a discourse I can weigh in on.

Matthew
01:24:20
Go on. Miles Mackenzie in Metroid Prime 4 Oh, I had this in my Mountain Out of a Molehill award later on. Well, the Mountain Out of a Molehill Award is very similar to this.

Samuel
01:24:31
It is. To the point where I wondered why you even suggested it. Yeah, I I really regretted it. Fair enough. Well this I don't mind blowing this early because I kind of agree that this sort of kidnapped the narrative around this game and and it still kind of and won. Really? It c sort of it dampened the game a bit?

Matthew
01:24:49
I can sort of understand why it happened, just because they'd shown so little of the game. That if you preview a bit of a game where you're with an AI companion, all you can really take away from that is, well this is what the game's gonna be. and so I'm not particularly into it. I just I just felt like the the tone of some of the preview write-ups I was expecting something like monstrously awful and like really, really off. And in fact, it's just it's like NAF game writing. Like 90% of game writing. I don't understand why we've singled out this particular NPC. Is it particularly egregious in them in them the Metroid which is so atmosphere heavy and atmosphere focused? Yeah, I get that, but I haven't quite finished it. I'm thinking I'm just on my way to the last boss now. But I There's so much that game where I just don't really think about that. And this isn't like a huge defensive, oh I think Metro Prime 4 is a 10 out of 10 or anything. I don't at all. But I I just think people really, really overpumped that. And then all the fucking hangers on got their hands on it on social media and all the memes and the it's just like Just fucking who cares, you know? Like let's let's not we're so desperate to dunk all the time and yeah, you know, lo and behold we played it and it was fine. Yeah. Just fucking so boring to me

Samuel
01:26:08
Yeah, it was a bummer actually. It was. I I yeah. It w y when you do play it, I did go into it thinking, oh here he is, I'm I'm ready for him to take over the game. And it does for about Fifteen minutes. Yeah and then you hear from him sporadically the rest of the time.

Matthew
01:26:24
His actual like mechanical role of like reaching out to you and offering you advice. It's no more than the game reaches out to you in Metroid Prime 3, which I you know just played a couple of months ago again. So maybe you know going into it from that you're like, oh I can see the the through line here, you know? I can understand that they've just gone from that to this, that kinda makes sense. Um again. Not saying it's like brilliant or perfect or anything. It's just nothing, you know? Yeah, I do agree with you.

Samuel
01:26:52
With that, Matthew, shall we take a quick break and have another guest pop in? Let's do it. It's Miles Mackenzie. Oh uh hey Samus, I uh really love dispatch this year. I thought it was a great computer game. Um

Dave Scarborough
01:27:05
Hello, Dave Scarborough here. No Ghostbusters games to uh put on my game of the year unfortunately, so I had to think a little bit outside the box. And I am denard over what my game of the year would be. This year in gaming has very much been centered around shared experiences with my kids and particularly my nine-year-old daughter. And I really did think that the Switch 2 was going to be the defining moment of gaming for us this year as far as multiplayer games go and We definitely had a lot of fun playing Mario Kart together and pad swapping Donkey Kong Bonanza, but neither of them quite scratched that itch in the same way that Split Fiction did. And I will caveat this by saying that playing any co-op puzzle solving game with a nine-year-old, one that involves combat and platforming and and various levels of intricate puzzle solving. can be a bit of an exercise in frustration. And so there were definitely some raised voices, some tantrums, mostly from me. But this for the most part was like this incredibly inventive and playful joint experience that we had together. Now it's not perfect, the story gets itself into some inelegant sort of tangles trying to set the stage and you know I think we celebrate mediocre dialogue a little bit too much. But once it gets going, it's hard to resist the charm or not get swept up in the potential of the various settings and stages that you go through. from like the the the sort of cyberpunky ones to the to the more fantastical, Tolkien-esque, and obviously the gameplay possibilities that each of those stages has. And I I will say the neo-noir futuristic stuff wasn't quite as interesting to me as the more whimsical diversions. You know, I just like farting pigs or riding around on dragons a little bit more than surfing along space rails and stuff in the sky. But nevertheless, whatever the stage was, that push pull of teamwork and solving puzzles together and sharing that sense of accomplishment with my daughter through the various stages was Really for me a great gaming experience in twenty twenty five. So yeah, that's my pick.

Samuel
01:29:05
Okay, next category. The brought to you by DoorDash Award for emptiest I've felt about video game hype. What have you got, Matthew?

Matthew
01:29:11
Um, there's not much meat on the bones here, but. You know, I just didn't do the Souksong thing this year. To be so outside the tent on something that's so big and, you know, seems to dominate the conversation for a couple of months. I've played, you know, not even half an hour of that game, so I've no idea if it does live up to the hype or anything. It just doesn't really speak to me.

Samuel
01:29:32
I think that's fair enough. Like it's Uh I think what the one comment we got on uh Spotify in the last week was like, I can't believe you guys were out on Silksong or you didn't get it or something like that. And I was a bit like, well You know, I th I don't think that's actually that surprising if you know the podcast. Um really. I think for me This would be Battlefield 6, which I think that like online audiences, they hate a live service game, they really tear one down. as evidenced at the with the last reveal of the Game Awards where people are asking the developers saying Concord 2 RIP and all that shit and you're like, wow, what a fucking toxic, awful audience this is. Yeah. And maybe game publishers should stop posting on Twitter because it's it's dog shit. But Battlefield six, they all propped up as like, oh this is the goat, they fucking did it. And I played it and I was like, it's fine, but it is just Battlefield. And you would think from the response to it that it was like the second coming. And I honestly just played it and thought, it's alright. But then immediately Artgraders came along and I was like, well actually this is something new and different and and really cool. And yeah, I just and I it's like 60 quid I spent on about five hours of game. So I can't say it like I felt amazing about that. It's It's like nothing wrong with it as such. It's just super familiar and people were egging it on like it was like, yeah, absolutely incredible and a game changer. But it's just a a solid battlefield game. But I think for everyone there's gotta be like a winner and loser and something. It can never just be like w like this game is fine. It just has to be like all or nothing because they're not very intelligent people talking about these things. So Yeah, that was that was the one. Um perfectly well-made game, but um yeah, just didn't really feel feel that much for it really. So next category, Matthew, is the if I was a thirsty, overly online person, this is the character I would thirst for award. Which is actually a Matthew Castle creation, not me. But uh yeah.

Matthew
01:31:26
What have you got? Uh that magic lady from Expedition 33.

Samuel
01:31:30
Oh no, we put the same word, Lune. Fuck's sake. I thought this is the one thing I could depend on you not to pick, because I know you just you're out on this game. But uh we both picked the barefoot magic lady.

Matthew
01:31:46
Well I d I I just every year I well not every year, we we haven't done this every year, but whenever we have this conversation We send up picking people and everyone's like, that's a 15-year-old or whatever. And you're like, well Is that what you picked you fee last year?

Samuel
01:31:59
Is that what happened? This person seems older. No, she's not fifty. She's like Uh I think she isn't she like thirty-two or something in the fiction of the game? Something like that.

Matthew
01:32:07
Well aren't they all the age when the w isn't it like their cutoff year, isn't that the setup of the game?

Samuel
01:32:12
Yeah, I think so. But the the d the exception is um May L is a bit younger and looks about fifteen. That's the thing.

Matthew
01:32:18
You see that would be the bad that would be the the bad wrong pick.

Samuel
01:32:21
That'd be the youthie pick of this year. Yeah Lune, I'm sad I'm s I'm really sad that we both picked that. Isn't that just they they they got us Matthew, they did us. They like profiled us, they made a character for us, and they it fucking worked. Look at us, what marks we are. Okay, um next category Matthew. Game from this year that would make great TV show or film. Is it a cheat to pick dispatch for this, which is already basically a TV show?

Matthew
01:32:50
So Yeah. Well I think that's fair enough. Next category then Matthew. The David Hater Award for game performance we each liked. Why we why is the scot we each liked? Oh I don't know actually. I don't know what I liked it should have been. Go back through the episode and add that to every award

Samuel
01:33:13
Imagine like they added to the Oscars best picture we all liked. And like just but no other category had that. That the majority agreed on. Best supporting actor That some people said was good. Look, it's not a legitimate awards, no one sponsors it. There are no tables you can buy. There are no tiny dinners that we serve at the awards do. Like none of that happens here. There's no drunken mid-marketing person.

Dave Scarborough
01:33:38
Account executive. Yeah.

Samuel
01:33:40
Oh, the go-to reference, I love that. Yeah, okay, so uh I've got either Aaron Paul or Jeffrey Wright in dispatch. They're both amazing in that game, and that is a game of voice actors really showing off. I did also put um Brandon Keener as Fishman Kai in um Avowed. You know, he never left my pie because I thought he was great. Just a really good pal in an RPG. I thought he was very well written and I enjoyed his company immensely. But you're not a year of like a massive year of performances for me really, Matthew, but what have you got?

Matthew
01:34:07
Oh so I've I've picked something a little bit more left field. I've picked an Australian voice actor called Adrian Vaughan who plays Mick the main character in the Drifter. Oh. So Drifter, yeah, it's a sort of like grindhouse Australian point and click uh adventure game. about this drifter called Mick who comes home and gets pulled into military conspiracies and it's a bit like David Cage-esque, like how ridiculous the misadventures pile on this guy from the outset. But I liked it for several reasons. The fact that quite different, quite rare to hear a a you know, a game set in Australia with a load of Australian voice actors. It's just kind of refreshing not to hear the same pool of voices over and over again, of which there is a lot of. I also thought he is to sell some really ridiculous stuff in this game, like it goes wrong for him so quickly and he could be just so sort of wild-eyed and that it could be quite hard to sort of sympathize with the character, but I actually think he he does manage to sell it. Starts at eleven this performance and then just keeps going up and up and up. Yeah, I just really liked it. I like the game in general. I don't think it's necessarily made my top ten. Just 'cause I I'm not wild about the third act of it, but I like the kind of griminess and messiness and chaos of those opening acts for sure.

Samuel
01:35:28
Yeah, it's uh that's a really cool looking game actually. It's um It's going on the wish list from this year of interesting things I missed, along with um that look outside horror RPG from um Devolver Matthew, which I'm kind of curious about. I like that as a pick, um, because I'd not even heard of it. So um you surprised me. Very good. There you go. Um okay, this is me, non-gaming media from this year that would make a great game. Um this is a great category. I think it's another Matthew Cast original. What have you got Matthew?

Matthew
01:35:55
Uh so I did wonder if you could do uh Pluribus in the Telltale adventure game style, if only to have the message everyone will remember that over and over again. Mm, that's a pleur of a scag for anyone who cares for it. Apple T V plus subscribers, please stand up. Oh all good, all three of you. Excellent. Um I really liked Department Q this year, which was the Scottish detective drama on Netflix, which I've imagined uh as a Scottish L. A. noir. Just loads of really photorealistic Scottish character actors. I think that would be a f a fun thing to pump two hundred million pounds into, you know, having to like stare down Mark Bonner and see if he's lying.

Samuel
01:36:37
That's uh those are good suggestions, Matthew. So no no adolescence MMO for you this year or uh God. Adolescence for you. Oh God. Oh God. What terrible thought. Um, I actually uh took uh so uh there were two um Stephen King as his alter Ego writer Richard Backman, I think it is. Um, adaptations this year, The Long Walk and The Running Man. Those are literally video game concepts. The long walk probably be quite a good VR game. I don't really know how you'd keep it going beyond having little bits of interactive narrative, but that might work. I also wondered if like the cozy British energy of Wake Up Dead Man, the latest knives out would be a good fit, Matthew. I feel like we're I feel like we're still in a big like there's one great detective game every year sort of era. Obviously I think we all know what that game is gonna be this year on your list, but um yeah, I don't know. I just thought It does tap into something, because I I know even though it's not set in the UK, it's clearly filmed in the UK Wake Up Dead Man. It's the most like British energy. of like a location you could possibly have that that church in the game and its surroundings.

Matthew
01:37:44
But uh any thoughts on those as a side note, I watched The Roses last night, that's one with Ben Dick Kamabach, and it's meant to be set in California and it's so clearly filmed in Devon. Like it's hilarious. I've never seen someone try to like pull off California coastal highways as like the Devon Coast, you know, it's like fucking Lime Regis ass locations.

Samuel
01:38:09
Yeah, that's funny. Like uh I I just You just can't do it. It's like that Austin Powers gag in reverse, you know? Like I can't believe the outskirts of London look like Southern California or whatever it is you see.

Matthew
01:38:21
That is a that is an English house. Like I just I can just tell that there's someone inside that watching Goggle Box. You know, it just just radiates that energy.

Samuel
01:38:30
It's uh it's unmistakable. We are only a ten minute drive from a Tesco Express, you know what I mean? You just know. You know it when you see it, or a Bet Fred, or a Greg's. But uh Yeah, what was the actual question? Yes. Oh no, it's okay. I was just I was just uh briefly asking for your views on my picks there. Long long walk, running man, wake up dead. Oh yeah, that would good.

Matthew
01:38:50
I could say the long walk, if you can have some like repetitive like rhythmic button action that you have to keep pressing to do the walk so your fingers literally get tired playing it you like sprinting in r uh rockstar game

Samuel
01:39:02
In a way, baby steps is very long walk coded, so yeah, I suppose that kind of counts in some ways. Yeah. Um

Matthew
01:39:11
Next category then. The Master Miller Award for a betrayal of a game that we said was good and then turned on weeks later.

Samuel
01:39:17
Has the back page ever turned on a game faster than Monster Hunter Wilds? Where like we did that episode with Joe and then weeks later we were like, eh. Which was just I I felt bad about it. I sort of had to really look myself in the mirror. There are things about it that are good, but it just felt like the that game didn't quite click this year. The foundations weren't there for it to really sort of like be this obsession for people and and it it's fell afoul of that all year. I'm still a believer in the Capcom hot streak, Matthew, but um it didn't quite happen, did it? What what are your thoughts?

Matthew
01:39:47
Yeah, I don't know if Just it was like the guest effect, 'cause I think Joe is a bit more into that game than we are. And so like sometimes I feel like we're kind of politer when we've got a guest, you know, we don't want to be like combative with someone. So um maybe that was part of it. I know I did like it. I did like it weirdly. I think it's a case of be careful what you wish for that game. Like on paper. The fact that I s I so smoothly made w made my way through it and there was like no friction and no frustration, which is stuff that I've cursed before in Monster Hunter. But then you r it really makes you realise, well that is what is at the heart of this game and actually if these things aren't like hard earned then it doesn't really make sense as a concept. So I hope the next one is like a bit more of a bastard in a way.

Samuel
01:40:35
Yeah, I think um some lessons are learned. I think the developers the lead developers even gone, please come back. We've changed the game or we're changing the game. So Yeah. You know, I it did sell like ten million copies out the gate, I'm sure they'll be fine. But uh yeah. I also for this had Assassin's Creed Shadows. Oh, but I never said that was good. I was always down on that game. Yeah, but you did like that g but you genuinely like that game, didn't you? Did you really turn on it? I didn't turn on it. I just I felt like You acknowledged that some stock over syndrome had occurred, perhaps.

Matthew
01:41:02
Yeah, and as I got a bit distanced from it, I uh I see some of it as like wasted time. I couldn't really put my finger on why I was able to step away from Yote, but I put in twice as much time into shadows. Even though they're you know, not the s the same game as such, but yeah, I d I don't I don't really know what happened there. Fair enough. It was a weird year.

Samuel
01:41:26
Yeah, it was a lot went down Okay, next category then Matthew.

Matthew
01:41:30
The best five minutes of a game.

Samuel
01:41:32
Yeah, this is a Matthew Castle suggestion. Uh I did struggle with this a bit because I feel like in some ways best

Matthew
01:41:38
Set B sums this up. This is because I wrote some awards without looking at the original document and then I put them in there and I thought you'd delete more of them than you did.

Samuel
01:41:46
Well I I d I I never want you to feel like I'm the dictator of the podcast, so I want you to feel like you've got a place at the table always. So I just s sort of allowed them and then thought, What w what will be will be? So I thought I would shout out the Silent Hill F bit with the Scarecrows here. Um because that is roughly five minutes per section and it is a it is amazing like having to basically it's a bunch of scarecrows positioned relative to each other. Some of them are pointing at others, some of the looking at others. And you get you have to select the right one to extract uh something from in order to like progress through this misty marsh that You are just stuck in basically. And it's really good. And it's the bit of the game that I enjoy the most of what I've played, but I will go back to it at some point, Matthew. What have you got?

Matthew
01:42:32
I picked oh sorry, I've just moved my document. This isn't I do actually have one written. This isn't one of the three, honest. Oh, so for this I picked the fourth DLC pack for Rise of the Golden Idol. has a level which is like a sort of self-contained condensed riff on Oberdin. It's a ship with h how did all these people die on a ship and It has to be an Obra Din bit. Like it's j it's just too similar and and the way the sentences are structured that you're filling in, like so-and-so was killed with this by this. It it just it feels very very Oberdin coded and I like the idea of it it's both a sort of homage but also a bit of a sort of show-off to show that you can do sort of someone else's whole game in like one level of your game. So I yeah, I like that. It took me longer than five minutes to do, but it was the I guess it's the five minutes of realizing that's what was happening.

Samuel
01:43:27
That's uh I think that's a good shout. I mean it's a nice place to plug that. That DLC because it can't come up in Game of the Year, so uh Can't it? That makes sense, Matthew. Oh oh no, it's up to you.

Matthew
01:43:45
But I I'm I'm probably not gonna put it in the list.

Samuel
01:43:48
Well it's totally up to you. I won't uh I won't fight you on that. Um shall we make room for one more guest here, Matthew? Then I think that's probably that'll probably cover all of them, won't it? Uh it should do, yeah.

Katharine
01:43:59
Hello Backpage Podcast, this is Catherine Castle, formerly of Eurogamer and Rock Paper Shotgun. I've played quite a lot of games I've liked this year. Promise Mascot Agency, Split Fiction bit of Hiro Warriors. Um but the one that took me at least the most by surprise and that that I really enjoyed uh was Drop Duchy. Imagine Tetris, but also a roguelike, but also a city builder, which is a slightly strange combination. But yet it's imagine you're placing pieces, Tetris pieces on a board. They can be terrain, warriors, buildings, barracks, types, things like that. And then yeah, you're trying to fix the board in a way that gives you an advantage and your enemy, you're also placing your enemy's pieces on the board, gives them a disadvantage, and then you sort of have a big fight at the end once the board is filled up. And it's it's it's very compelling. I would recommend you check it out on Steam. And yeah, play DropDutchy. Thanks. Bye

Samuel
01:44:53
Welcome back to the podcast. So, final few categories. We'll race through these now, Matthew. I think they're all pretty light these ones. Press triangle right now to hear the best QTE of the year. Fuck, I really struggle with this one. What have you got? Uh

Matthew
01:45:05
It may have been in the original Ghost of the Tsushima, but in Ghost of the Otai you do that thing where you cut the bamboo and you have to hit the different bows. But

Samuel
01:45:13
That's hard.

Matthew
01:45:13
Sometimes it does it and like one little bamboo goes spinning off, and then you you can press like a shoulder button to chop that in half, and that it's just a cool little flourish at the end of it. So

Samuel
01:45:23
That QTE. I think that flourish might be new. I don't remember that from the original, but obviously I do remember the mini game. So yeah, I like that. That's a good shout. I'm not really a big QTE guy these days, but I will say I I did like some of the spells in Expedition 33. One called Lightning Dance that Lune does, the one that me and Matthew got horned up for if you care. That absolutely fucks some lads up. That spell rules, so that that Can't account Matthew. Next Kagri. The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Prize for best minigame. I really like the dragon bits in Doom the Dark Ages. Like a basic like a cheeky bit of Panzer Dragoon cross with Star Fox. I thought they were they were really cool and like it's really simple sort of like dodge mechanics and cool attacks and just just look nice and we're a bit of a break from the rest of the game, so I like those. Um I don't think that really counts as a mini game, it's kind of is part of the game, but it's not. Yeah, I think so. Um what about what about you, Matthew? You're like the mini-game king.

Matthew
01:46:20
Oh I've got two ghosts of Fiote in a row. It's almost like one of them was improvised. Uh I I picked uh Zeni Hajiki, which is the coin flicking game of Ghosts of Yotai. It's basically like bowls but played with coins on a pub tabletop. We flick coins to try and knock them off the table. Ah it's great. That's really really good. That's better than the rest of the ghost COT.

Samuel
01:46:44
Brutal. I got more of that game to play actually. It's not gonna get into the game of the year list um unfortunately. Not enough time, but um I still look forward to it as a Christmas game. I might put in Zenny Hajiki but not Ghost of Yote That's peak Matthew Castle that is. You're such a you're such a fucking mini game guy you are. You fucking love a mini game. So uh you really do though, don't you? No wonder you're a big warriorware guy, like The mini games are just so your thing. Okay. But you're not a big Mario Party guy to be fair, so yeah. Alright, the Masahiro Sakurai Award for best unlockable. This is the one carry I don't really have anything for actually, Matthew, so when it goes.

Matthew
01:47:19
The aristocrat King Boo costume from Mario Kart World. It's Boo in a fur coat and a monocule. I think I got it by eating some popcorn in Boo Cinema while playing as King Boo. I d I don't know what more else that there is to say. I just what like the the name of the award.

Samuel
01:47:36
Isn't there a horny Rosalina Or another female character outfit in one of these as well, where I was a bit like, is that been included for the dads?

Matthew
01:47:44
It might not even be an unlockable, it might be there from the start, but um Yeah, I mean a lot of them were in like, you know, racing, like leathery, like biker gear and stuff, which is sort of Slightly corny adjacent. Nothing I wouldn't say not none of its pillion strength.

Samuel
01:48:01
The only podcast that will ever mention like Pillion and Mario Kai, the same breath. Pillion and Wario. Only the back page gives you that. Wario in the woods on those picnic benches. No, thank you. I love that that's would that be your scariest um scene in a film this year?

Matthew
01:48:18
No, not at all because it makes it sound like I'm in uh like uh you know I'm prudish or something. I'm not I just it just stuck with me because it was It was full on and uh not what I associate with a pit knit.

Samuel
01:48:29
Pretty memorable, yeah. Um yeah, I do know I would pick one of the Donkey Kong transformations, but let's face it, there's gonna be a chat about that game in the game of the episode, so let's just leave that um for now, Matthew. Um it doesn't really count as unlockable anyway, I don't think. So Okay. Most frustrating earworm sound effects. Okay, this goes to Promise Mascot Agency for the something went wrong with a mascot during an event sound. That kind of noise that plays. That causes some psychic damage now. Love the game, but that that that jumps out, Matthew. What about you?

Matthew
01:49:00
I've gone for the ding dong bing bong that plays at the start of every day in the hundred line. A sound effect you will hear five thousand times.

Samuel
01:49:08
Maybe we should play like both those sound effects back to back now in this episode, just so people can hear 'em in a row and kind of know what the deal is. That might be fun.

Matthew
01:49:15
Please don't mistake the ding dong bing bong for the doorbell which is happening elsewhere in this episode. There isn't a surprise guest.

Samuel
01:49:23
Yeah, it is like a old fashioned radio like a US shock jock radio show with the amount of sound effects in this one.

Matthew
01:49:29
I know what the listeners are like. They hear that bell going to feel like a dog running up to the door expecting another guest to come through and tell them about game of the year.

Samuel
01:49:36
Dave Scarborough going, oh I thought FIFA was great this year or whatever it might be. Unnecessary swipe at Dave there, but yeah.

Matthew
01:49:43
Let's see what happens when we hear it

Samuel
01:49:55
Okay, this is a Matthew Castle category, this one. Um biggest mountain out of a molehill. Brackets maybe too similar to discourse as it proved to be.

Matthew
01:50:02
Uh so I probably should have done Miles Mackenzie for this. Uh my unpopular one for this is uh Nintendo Key Cards. I get it. You want the game on the cards? But uh loads of people have digital collections. Everyone on PC play digitally these days. I just don't see why it's a thing. But th that's just me personally.

Samuel
01:50:20
Well the thing is I think this is what separated Nintendo from the other manufacturers and it's why I did like the Switch. that it had that element to it. So I do get it. Um but you know I do I do acknowledge what you're saying. It's not d it's not deterred me from buying um different Switch games, really. But yeah. Next category then, Matthew.

Matthew
01:50:39
Best addition to virtual console library. It's not even called that. It's called the Nintendo Switch Online catalog?

Samuel
01:50:46
Yeah. Yeah. Um a Chibi Ropo. Oh yeah, that's what I think. Yeah, I mean we they could have charged for that for sure and been like we've reclaimed an old GameCube classic. It might have been a niche seller, but It's a notoriously hard to get game.

Matthew
01:50:59
Yeah.

Samuel
01:50:59
It's a a cult favorite from the end of the GameCube era. What's not to like, you know? Yeah, absolutely.

Matthew
01:51:04
And it is good. It's fun. Like it you should you should give it a go and you can see that it's gonna be fun and weird right from the off.

Samuel
01:51:09
So uh hot take, they're not doing too bad with those GameCube games so far. It's like they're off to a pretty solid start. I think they're doing alright. I thought it'd be slower than this. I thought it'd be like the the first year of the N64 kind of vibes where it's like one game for twelve months or something, but they're doing alright. They brought that weird Wario game back, Matthew, which I assume was a big deal to you once upon a time.

Matthew
01:51:29
Yeah, that's uh that's interesting. I mean I can think of like weirder things they could do. Come on, Doshin. That's what we want.

Doshin, eternal dinosaurs those are the ones we we'd really like to see. Yeah. Game you did the biggest U-turn on, Matthew.

Matthew
01:51:41
Oh, I deleted this one. W Before we started, you said to me You better have got answers for all the categories you added, of which this is one. Uh and I I had so few answers for it, I just deleted it so I didn't have to think about it.

Samuel
01:52:02
Well I'll just tell you my one, shall I? I d I picked Fortnite because they added the Simpsons to it. And that Springfield map was actually in my short list for best level this year. I thought that was like an amazing free thing to do. I don't think that Fortnite is really my kind of thing ultimately. But they added so many nice touches to that Simpsons world. They're like, you know, boss fights with different characters. There's like donuts that rain down from the sky and smash through all the different scenery and it's like the detail of like the Simpsons house and all that kind of stuff and the you know, that some of the Quite niche references that are out there in the different parts of the town. I thought it was like really impressive.

Matthew
01:52:37
So isn't the thing aren't you like going into a house to like Look at all the fan service and then a fucking eight-year-old runs in and shotguns your brains out though.

Samuel
01:52:46
Well that is the weird thing, is like you do have like all these characters running around with guns and it's a bit strange, but Fortnite is paced well enough that you still you had a bit of time to to walk around that house and I think me and my brother played Fortnite together about five times in the time that this was around and we were just We were sure to explore every square inch of it and just see what they'd made, basically. So you know, I'm not saying it's I th I I it's beloved to me or anything like that. I've not played it since they got rid of the Simpsons bit of it. It's why I came uh into the game in the first place, but as a like free tie-in, pretty impressive really. And uh yeah, I just thought it was I just thought it was quite cool. And uh Yeah, me and my brother like the Simpsons exactly the same really, so we um we both got a lot out of it.

Matthew
01:53:27
But uh I like the idea of armies of kids just getting ready to like murder a load of like Basically like day tourists into Fortnite.

Samuel
01:53:35
Yeah, basically. But it's quite it's quite generous. We actually I think I won three games of Fortnite when we were playing it, which is I don't know, I mean it can't be again, if you're fighting against children, let's say let's like kids playing it on shitty mobile phones or whatever. Me with a me at thirty seven with like about twenty five years of playing first person shooter game experience, like I do stand a bit more of a chance than those children do, unfortunately. So yeah. Final category then, Matthew. Most backpage coded character or location. Surely we have the same one for this. I've got Feast Lair in Donkey Kong Bonanza. And the fact that all of the turf has been made out of like beef, basically. The whole level is a big beef patty. Like that's About as backpage as it gets, really.

Matthew
01:54:22
Also, like the mechanic is chucking salt around, which also sounds very true to us. It does. Two salty bastards.

Samuel
01:54:29
It's very true. That was it, Matthew. Those are the alternative awards. Finally, I was gonna do who won the critic draft for 2025. So we talked about this behind the scenes. So at the start of the year, in the predictions episode that we always do. We do this thing where we take it in turns to pick five games from this year. Yeah. And then we see who is going to get the highest like Metacritic scores for each of those games kind of combined, basically. And me and Matthew both have the same thing where we each picked a game that got delayed out of this year. In Matthew's case it was Fable, and in my case it was Reanimal. So we both ended up with four games at the end of the day. There was Monster Hunter Wilds, Hollow Knight Silksong, Split Fiction. Oh wait, I didn't say who picked what each one, that would be useful, wouldn't it? Tear it up. Let me start again. I'm so bad at this, man. Oh god. It's like I can't host a real radio show. You read out your four, I read out my four. That sounds good. Um okay, so I picked Monster Hunter Wilds, Split Fiction, Civilization 7, and Metal Gifts on a Delta Snake E to.

Matthew
01:55:33
I picked Hollow Knight Silt Song, Ghost of Yote Doom the Dark Ages and Elden Ring Night Rain.

Samuel
01:55:39
So by the criteria that we discussed over mobile, I did this mass about two hours ago. And I have it as 337 points for me to 336 points for you. Literally a one-point difference. So I have Monster Hunter Worlds at 88, Split Fiction at 90. Civ at 76, Snake Eater at 83. Um, which was so the the lowest that each game scored per format. So if it was reviewed on three formats, whichever format got the lowest. Yeah. At at launch basically. Um However, if you do extend that and say that include split fiction on Switch 2, for example That brings my my score down. However, that wasn't a launch platform. Yeah. And it it does run worse on Switch 2, apparently. I was wondering if you think this is fair that I've won this.

Matthew
01:56:30
I did the math for both of us 'cause I wanted to make sure it was fair. Not that I didn't trust ya I just did the mask for both of us and I came to the same result. It might flip if you did it as like the highest platform at each moment. I don't know. I mean uh Hollow Knight Silk song, that's the one that screwed me a little bit. I think you can get that to like 94 if you take the highest score. But listen, we agreed lowest. I think that is the fairest way of doing it.

Samuel
01:56:52
So Yeah, I think so. I Civ climbs like three points if you

Samuel
01:56:57
move it up that that way as well. I think Snake Eater actually moves up like three points as well because it was I think PC is the lowest plat the lowest platform. So

Matthew
01:57:04
Listen, it was closer than it was last year, so I'll take it. Uh I'm really disappointed that my Elden Ring Night Rain play didn't didn't come through. I just assumed people would be giving those games like ninety just as a matter of course for forever more, but obviously not.

Samuel
01:57:19
Yeah, so Monster Hunter got eighty-eight, split fiction ninety, Civ got seventy six, Snake Eater got eighty three, and for Matthew, Hollow Knight, Silkson got ninety, Doom the Dark Age has got eighty-three. Eldering Night Rain got seventy-seven. That might actually be a good contender for did the critics get this wrong um actually. Um and then Ghost Iote got eighty six. Yeah, it was close, Matthew, but um I don't know, maybe we should make a bigger deal of this next year. I always enjoy doing this this with you. something to think about. Well that's the podcast done Matthew. We'll be back next week with the best games of 2025. As ever. Uh where can people get you on social media?
