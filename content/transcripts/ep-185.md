Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Ooh, hello.
Hello, Matthew. Again, far too warm and busy a midweek episode to be doing that kind of enthusiastic welcome, but I just wanted to jolt you out of your sort of like mild 6 p.m. coma on a 27 degree day.
I feel like the energy's been raised by the pre-chat for this episode, as you're about to discover.
Oh my gosh, yes. Before our guests entered the Discord chat, the energy was so low. I thought, is this going to be a fucking disaster?
And then Simon Miller, our guest this week, turned up and turned everything around. So Simon, how's it going? You well?
Oh yeah, no, honestly, I said to you guys before we started recording, you are the second podcast I've done this week. And the other guy said exactly the same thing. For some reason, I've decided it's a huge badge of honor.
I'm just gonna come along, I'm gonna annoy everyone with my energy, and I'm gonna leave again. People are gonna have to try and figure out, did we enjoy that or not? I don't know.
I'm like the anti-2024.
I'm very proud. I feel like I've been ambushed by some kind of fire alarm going off, you know what I mean? And that's exactly the energy I was hoping for, so that's good.
So yes, our guest this week is presenter, wrestler, and consultant, Simon Miller, a former colleague of mine and well-known for his years at videogamer.com. Simon is also the person I've podcasted with the most, aside from Matthew, so we worked on the X360 Magazine podcast and the System Linked podcast on beloved website nowgamer.com. So, those are some things that we've done.
But Simon, really happy to have you. What are you up to at the moment? Anything fun you can talk about?
I mean, yeah, I'm kind of like a mishmash of things these days, although I very much enjoy that walk down memory lane, because I mean, a lot of what we were doing back then kind of forged me into what I'm doing now really, which was essentially just have as much fun as possible with the things that you enjoy. So yeah, you know, I'm still doing the YouTube stuff. Apparently, I can't get enough of that.
And I'm predominantly wrestling YouTube now, which is an absolutely bizarre thing to say. But I also have like fitness videos I do. And I do a lot of what we were talking about.
I do a lot of work for WWE 2K, which is excellent. And yes, I wrestle. And for some reason I act now as well.
I mean, what a pretentious asshole I am. But these are the things that I've decided to get into. So yeah, I mean, every day is something different, which is what I always wanted.
So I can't get mad at that.
Oh, glad to hear it, man. That's, yes, excited to have you on here because I think we always had such a good podcast chemistry back when we did. I think we were like, we're really good at it.
Obviously, we are, I forgot as well, we made our doomed podcast side project, Dr. Threat Level, which I also just remembered then. A doomed gaming pop culture podcast that we did for about four or five times then abandoned in 2011 or so.
Can that still be listened to?
No, I don't think it is actually because it was hosted on like a pod boom or something like that and I didn't pay the fee. Something happened. It's lost the time.
So yeah, it's now internet deep lore and you know, maybe it's available on the dark web. I'm not sure.
I will say that. I enjoyed all of that, Sam. I still look back very, very fondly on everything we did.
I thought it was some good stuff.
Yeah, and we did and I regret we've not stayed in touch as much over the last few years because I've definitely had recall some years of us just being sort of like incredibly close. So I'll own that for being a very complicated man. So, yes, but it's lovely to have you on and to talk a bit about your past in games journalism because it's a really interesting career you've had, like kind of going from print to becoming a sort of presenter.
It feels like a sort of inevitable arc in some ways, just from what I remember of working with you. So I suppose to start with Simon, how did you get into games and what mattered to you on the game side growing up?
I mean, I kind of got into it mostly because of jealousy, because my friend, my friend Nick Hesketh had, I haven't talked to Nick Hesketh in 25 years, but he had a Mega Drive and he had James Pond. And I was like, I want to play James Pond on the Mega Drive. And so I used to sort of try and, you know, convince him that we should always do stuff at his house because he had James Pond on the Mega Drive.
And I don't know, it was just one of those things where, you know, from a very early age, I just knew it was something that I enjoyed. And then I suppose very luckily my brother also got into it and then, you know, when you have two young boys yelling at their parents, we really want a video game system, eventually your parents just buckle and they do whatever you demand of them through pain of who knows what. And yeah, eventually, I mean, I say that, we got an NES when the NES was definitely dead and the SNES was definitely, and the SNES was definitely what we should want it.
But it didn't matter, right? I didn't know about that at that time. So obviously, you know, you go through all the Mario games and I remember they had Kung Fu, which is called something different in America.
I can't remember what it was called in America. I think it's called like Karate Man or something, which is probably offensive. But yeah, we, and I just, I just remember that being some of the coolest things I did when I was younger.
And then it just became, you know, you know, birthdays or Christmases came around and you just said, well, you know, I want this and I want that. And it was a very Nintendo focused household. I just think because that's what my parents assumed, I guess it's very similar to today, right?
When you're not sort of super in-gaming, you just go, oh, we'll get a Nintendo machine. So, you know, we went from the NES to the SNES, which I still think, the NSES, I still think is one of the greatest, if not the greatest consoles ever. And then that's when I really just realized I'm gonna do this forever because stuff like Link to the Past was just, I mean, even to this day, I'll go back and play on various systems.
I'm just like, man, the fact this came out in the early 90s is just like incredible. It's just so ahead of its time and it's so damn cool. And by the time the Nintendo 64 rolled around, they had that same experience again with Ocarina of Time, where they essentially just went, oh, we'll move the camera down here.
Oh, third person, amazing. Well, that's all it is, right? Technically, all Ocarina of Time is is Link to the Past, but we pulled the camera down.
That's all it is.
Yeah, but it's also my favorite game ever, so they must have done something right. And I think without wanting to get to mental health, which I seem to do on all these podcasts, people will have to forgive me that do enjoy hearing me on these things. It's just always been one of the things where if I'm stressed or if I need some downtime or if I need to be distracted, you can just sit there and you can just play a game.
And while there was definitely sort of a period, probably shortly after Imagine Publishing, where maybe you start thinking more about career-wise, what am I going to do? You think, oh, I haven't got time for games, really. There's that awesome quote, there's something like, wasted time that's enjoyed isn't wasted.
And that was what video games were for me, is that of course it means nothing. You're not going to get anywhere with this, but it's great and it's fun. And it takes your brain out of it.
So yeah, I mean, ever since then, I always realized that if we need some downtime, we just need to chat, go play a game and you can sit there for an hour and it's great, or you can sit there for 10 hours and have a ridiculous day playing something. And it's still awesome. One of the best memories I ever had is when Arkham City came out and I was reviewing it for whoever the hell I was reviewing it for and it came on a Saturday and I realized I had nothing to do.
And I was like, screw it. And I played it for 11 hours. And I still remember how much I enjoyed that day.
I mean, it's probably not good for overall physical health, but who cares? So yeah, it's just always been there. And again, these days I would certainly like to play more.
I mean, you do get older and you realize you have to juggle responsibilities, but I still make sure I play. And it's just, I just think games are the coolest thing ever. And I feel blessed to have grown up during the evolution when they did, because now there's so many things that I hate about the modern.
But back then it was just so simple, right? It literally could be buy a cartridge, which was overpriced, but that's fine. Stick it in the machine, blow in it if it doesn't work and away you go.
Whereas now there's so many times I sit down to play Xbox or PlayStation or whatever. Oh, I have to update for three hours. Awesome, great.
That's a fun time. But so yeah, that's probably the short version of my story.
Right, right. So do you think you naturally lean Nintendo even now that is? Is that still an area of games that you pay attention to when like a Tears of the Kingdom comes out?
Is that on your radar?
Oh yeah, no, for sure. And although actually, if we want to start off controversially, I'm not the biggest fan of the direction that Nintendo have taken the Zelda franchise. They're still really good games.
But on the Direct the other day, when they announced that, you know, the literal Zelda game where you get to play Zelda, which is way more, I mean, they've taken ideas from Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, for sure, but it's way more old school. I hate that term, but we'll just use it. I was so excited.
I was, oh, finally, we're not giving this up because while the internet was very keen to get away from dungeon, find item, use item to defeat boss, move on, I was perfectly, I could have had that for the rest of my life. But look, they're amazing games and they've taken over in many ways. But yeah, I think probably just from a nostalgia point of view, you know, I try and play everything, but Nintendo, if I had to get rid of, if I had to keep one, it would be Nintendo, yeah, for sure.
Yeah, that makes sense. That's interesting to hear as well. Like I think the Zelda creating tables thing has captured the imaginations of old Nintendo kind of internet.
So yeah, pleased to hear that's reached you too. So when did you know you wanted to work in games, Simon? Or did you kind of reverse into it?
So it's such a dumb story. I had just finished my last exam at university and I was traveling back on the bus to my house, wherever I was going. And I was reading Official Nintendo Magazine.
And my girlfriend at the time said to me, what are we gonna do? That's our last exam. And because I was reading Official Nintendo Magazine, I kind of read whatever I was reading.
I looked up and went, you know what? I'm gonna write about video games. And even though I said it somewhat in jest, for the rest of the day I was like, well, why can't I write about video games?
Somebody's gotta write it. Like somebody's gotta do it. So I literally sort of sat on that idea for, I don't know, two, three, four months, whatever it was.
And then I just sat down and tried to figure it out. And I realized it was just like any other job. You just keep an eye on publishing houses, be it Future or Imagine, or whichever else we had back then.
And you just keep an eye on their job page. And when something comes up, apply for it. Something comes up, apply for it.
So it's the most dull story ever. I just found jobs related to what I wanna do. But I think it was one of those things where, like most of us, you kinda come out of university probably a bit scared, a bit intimidated about what you're meant to do.
And I didn't like the idea of being an adult. I really liked the idea of still doing things that I loved and keeping that childlike passion alive, which is essentially everything I've done in my life has been based on that. And it was just something in my brain which was like, oh yeah, I think that sounds like a really good idea.
So yeah, from that point on, obviously I went to Manchester. I left Manchester, went back home and I just figured out how to do it. And I was lucky to get my foot in the door.
Well, that's cool. I got three different questions actually off the back of what we've discussed already. One, do you still know the guy who looks like David Boreanaz?
Oh yeah, I'm literally going to his stag do because he's getting married in a couple of weeks. So yeah, we are still good friends and he still looks like David Boreanaz.
I'll update my internal Wiki for that.
Awesome.
Two, the girlfriend, the ex-girlfriend you mentioned there, is that the one where you pretended to be ill while you were playing Shadow of the Colossus? Is that a story you can tell on this podcast? Enough time passed.
She knows about that. This is the one where she turned up at my house, right? Yeah, so I was sat there playing Shadow of the Colossus and my phone rang and I looked at it and I was like, nah, I'd rather play Shadow of the Colossus.
And then she was coming to my house. So she just knocked on the door. I mean, you couldn't get away with it, right?
It's so obvious what I was doing. I did that a couple of times. I did it with Call of Duty once too.
I'm not even a big Call of Duty guy. But I found my momentum on playing online. I was like, man, I'm doing really well.
I was like, I can't break this streak. And then she walked in and she's like, you're an asshole. She's 100% correct.
100% correct.
Amazing. Well, I'm sorry that one did work out.
And my third question was, am I right in thinking you went for an ONM staff writer position and got quite close but missed out? Am I imagining that?
No, you're totally right. You're totally, totally right. That was my first interview, I guess, for lack of a better word.
I don't think I had one before that. But yes, no, I did. And I don't wanna get negative, but I was basically told the way that I live my life would not be conducive to how the video game industry works, which I still find the most preposterous thing.
So the headlines is, I don't drink alcohol. No big reason to it, I just don't do it. And I was told one of the reasons I got turned down is because if everybody went out with a publisher and I wasn't drinking it, it would be a bad fit.
Which in hindsight is...
When did you apply?
That would have been sort of, I guess 2006, I would guess. Around then.
2006. I know exactly who would have said that.
I remember getting that feedback and going like, that's not helpful. You should have just lied. You should have just lied.
You should have just lied. Just made something up. But I know it is.
Imagine you did that today. You could cancel that person so quickly. You could just shut them down.
I wish. Retroactive cancelling, please.
But ultimately, do you know what, man? That was the best thing. That was one of the things you look back on.
And thank goodness I didn't get that. Because where I did end up had way more creative freedom. And that is something that I definitely need to thrive as best as I can.
So yeah. But at the time, rubbish. Absolutely rubbish.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So I was curious, Simon, were games always your first love? Unlike a lot of other games genres we work with, you had a very even range of interest to me, like music and wrestling. Was any one thing on top?
Was video games ever on top for you?
No, it was always like a... Everything was a front runner at some point. Do you know what I mean?
It was like a wake up, what do we feel like doing today? Honestly, it all came when I was 16 years old. I was having this conversation with someone the other day through no reason whatsoever.
But for some reason at 16, obviously I had been playing games for a long time by then. But at 16 I decided, man, that's it. You know, I love games for life.
We're sticking with the games. It was the same with wrestling. I've been watching wrestling for ages.
I decided, man, we're sticking with wrestling for life. And then I found Metallica and that got me into super duper music. And that's when I picked up a guitar as well.
I thought I'm going to just play guitar for ages. And I've been reading Batman comics kind of, we'll call it semi-professionally. And I decided, no, we're going to read Batman comics professionally.
And this all just happened at 16. And it was really cool because they are still things I'm super passionate about today. So, but there have been times when, I think you guys will get this too.
The problem about going into a job where it is your passion is eventually you run down the love for a bit and you kind of have to recharge it. And because I was in games for so long, there was a couple of years where that did go away. But I re-found it again.
And I think that's cool because it shows that you do actually like this stuff. It's just as cool as these jobs are. They are jobs and they come with difficulties and stresses which kind of blur the lines.
But no, I mean, I guess video games was my first love in the sense I found it first. But quickly I realized they all sort of sit on the same level when it comes to my passions and what gets me excited, etc.
It makes you quite a healthy person, I think.
My trick to surviving is that what I love is being stepped on by management. So it's really, really worked out fine over 18 years or whatever it is.
Totally. That's what happens.
Like I say, Simon, energy was low before you entered the room.
That's what I do. I come in and I just bring everybody up and then we decide whether this was a good idea or not.
I've got a weird question.
Please.
You're a very confident person. You know, you've got this huge energy, this big confidence energy. Have you always had this?
Were you like this when you were a part... Were you like this when you were applying for O&M? You know, I knew you when you joined NRevolution and in the magazine, but not in person.
I'm just kind of curious, like, have you... Like did you have all this energy back then as well?
I was the opposite. I can tell you a story about my first day, or my first week, imagine, when I was working on NRev and I was so scared and I was so intimidated by the world around me. My designer at the time, who turned out to be a, well, a divisive guy, but a very nice guy to me, he literally, he was literally next to me going, is the new guy going to speak?
Does he speak? And in that moment, I decided there's two things you can do here, Simon. You can either speak or you can just absolutely not speak.
And I chose absolutely not speak, so I had just sat there not saying anything. They must have been like, we've hired a deaf mute, so no, it took me, I don't know when it all kicked in eventually. Do you know what?
I think it was that classic thing, really, that you find yourself into the real world, there's a lot of intimidation, and then you get to a certain age and you just wake up one day, probably when I hit 30, to be honest, and you're just like, man, I know who I am, I don't care anymore, I can't be bothered. I'm just going to be unashamed of me, and I think when you kind of tap into that part of you and you just accept it, all of a sudden the confidence is almost, I don't know if it's confidence more than it is just sort of, you're just comfortable, when you're comfortable and you don't really care what anybody else thinks, you're going, oh, this is just me, take it or leave it. So, but no, yeah, it definitely wasn't, although, I mean, Sam may be able to attest to this too, because he was there.
I got thrust into quite an important position early on at Imagine, so maybe that sped it up a bit, where I was like, okay, well, you know, we're going to have to bring in some of those traits, otherwise no one's going to listen to you if you sit there and don't say anything. Quite literally, they will not listen to you because you're not making noise. But I'm sure there was an array of things there, yeah.
See, I remember you being a big personality from the off in the office, Simon. I just, yeah, I remember you always being, like, sort of, yeah, just, you know, if someone came up to your desk, you'd be sort of switched on, you'd have the energy, you'd make the time for them. You know, I thought you were kind of always like that.
And I think you sort of just got more and more comfortable with being that as the years went on. And then, like, yeah, I think there was about 10 different people who would come to your desk on a daily basis, I feel like, for a five minute matter. So, yeah, I don't really remember you being shy.
I remember, like, the very brief time that you were quite, you were quite skinny because you had, like, an injury, I remember, so you took up jogging. At first, you came up to me and offered me some, like, appalling Wii game for, like, for a freelance review, and it was, like, my first week or something. And you were incredibly gaunt, and I was just, like, who's this, like, slightly nervous gaunt man, but very polite gaunt man?
And then, yeah, like, I don't know, within six months, my perception of you completely flipped. So, yeah, I think you were, you were pretty, you always brought that energy. It was definitely, definitely an asset.
So, yeah. So, before you end up working at Imagine, Simon, you briefly worked at Sony. What was that like?
That was a real interesting Sony. So, yeah, that came up, again, was in The Guardian. Again, I look at The Guardian news pages, and they said, you know, do you like games?
Yes. Do you want to write about games? Sort of a lie, but it's technically true.
And I was like, as it were from their point of view, I was like, yes. And it turned out to be a copyrighted, or a junior copyrighted job, where you would write instruction manuals for PlayStation, which at the time was just the coolest thing ever. I remember, I said, there's no way I'm going to get this, but I'm going to apply to it.
And amazingly, the reason I got the job, they told me this, it was like the complete opposite of what we've just talked about, is because on my CV and when we were chatting, I'd mentioned industry events like Gamescom and E3, and they just liked the applied knowledge. That was it. They were like, that's what put you over the head.
We like the fact that quite clearly you were passionate about games. So that was nice. I think the issue with it was, it was way less creative than I was hoping to the point, I can't remember which way around it was now, but in the instruction manual you had to write press X to jump.
You couldn't write jump the other way around. I can't even think what that would be now. To jump, press X.
I can't remember which way it was around now, but it got so anal about stuff like that. The event show was like, man, it's a cool job and I'm really, you know, I'm happy that I got it. But I just knew this wasn't, even though it was games and it was cool, it was going to become way too repetitive on a day to day basis.
Although I did get to be part of the Shadow of the Colossus scandal. I tell this story all the time, even though I'm not meant to tell it, but no one works there anymore. Who cares?
And I don't know if they still exist, but in the UK's Shadow of the Colossus instruction book, they call the guy Wonder, right? They say the guy's name is Wonder. That was a complete mistranslation because again, I'm not very good with Japanese, but they don't, if you would go, they wouldn't write Wanderer in Japanese, it would just read as Wonder.
And whoever translated it thought it meant the guy's name was Wonder, but no, it was just meant to be a Wanderer. It was meant to have no identity. So they wrote this instruction book saying, oh, Wonder does this, Wonder does that.
And Sony Japan just flipped out. What are you doing? This is not, you just made up a name for this guy that's meant to be completely baseless.
So I got to be there for all of that. Yeah, yeah, I got to be there.
I had no idea that was the case. Okay, so that character is not actually called Wonder, that character has no name.
Maybe they retroactively fit it, but I remember being in the office when there was a meltdown with people being like, who translated this? His name's not Wonder, it's meant to be Wunderer, but they'd already written it in, so there was nothing to do. So that made me chuckle a lot.
And I think I've, I think this must have been on the VideoGamer podcast. So I shouldn't tell it again, but I'm going to anyway, because it's the funniest story ever. They don't care about me now, and I don't care about them, so it's all good.
I remember being in a, whatever it was, a publishing meeting, a management meeting, and they were talking about memory cards. It must have been for the PS3, I would guess. And I remember they started talking about, because remember how many PS2 memory cards they sold?
Do you remember? It was like this crazy thing that everybody wanted, a PlayStation 2 memory card. And it cost like 25 quid, 30 quid.
And 8 megabytes.
That's right. And I had literally bought one a week before I started at Sony, and I remember them talking about how they'd got the, I get so bad with production terms, but they got the amount that they were paying for it, down to like, I don't know, 75p, a pound. And then somebody else said, but we're still going to sell it for 25 quid.
And the whole room was like, ha ha ha ha. And I sat there going, yeah, I just spent 25 pound on that. Thanks.
Thanks very much. And I remember, I think it was moments like that where I was like, man, I think this is my kind of, this is my kind of place. And yeah, after about six months, the guy that I was working with, as nice as he was, he was just too, everything was a mistake.
Like, you know what I mean? I wrote the Buzz Jr. Jungle Party PSP manual. So I was writing stuff like, I'm a gorilla, whey.
And he was all like, wow, I didn't think a gorilla would speak like that. And I was like, oh my gosh, this is just, it was too painful. So look, I really appreciate the opportunity because it got me Sony on my CV, which I assume helped me get my foot in the door next round.
But I just kept my eye out for whatever was next. So yeah, really good experience. But also told me early on that if we don't have to work in London, let's not do it because the commuting and the money was just, it was a bit of an eye opener.
So but I do appreciate it though. It was a good time. I had a good, I think about eight months there.
I can't believe that one thing. That's genuinely like, just like when Ellie Gibson came on the podcast and said that Jack and Jack and Daxter is only called that because her mate was called Jack and she suggested it in a meeting.
That's like, that's amazing.
Just very basic, basic bits of like gaming law that people I know had a hand in. So how did you end up end up moving to Bournemouth and working there?
I mean, again, I just kept my eyes on newspapers and it said, you know, staff writer and I just applied for it. And I'm pretty sure they saw Sony on my TV and thought we got to talk to this guy. And yeah, so I came down and I'm sure I went through the same interview process that you did, Sam, got dropped the big old wage and I was like, yeah, that ain't very much money.
But I knew that I wanted to do it again. I've always been quite headstrong with that stuff is like, well, we can figure the money out. There'll be a way to figure that out.
But it's the it's the opportunity that I want. And I don't know what happened. And again, if so long ago, somebody with more know would have to make a call.
But obviously, I got assigned to NRev, the Nintendo magazine, as a staff writer. And apparently, until like 48 hours before, I was meant to be on the what was the cheat magazine they had or the walkthrough magazine?
Power Station.
Yeah, that's it. Apparently, I was meant to be on Power Station. But the last minute it was switched is on Simon's got to be on NRev.
And I don't know if that's true or not. Somebody told me that. But that is that is like a sliding doors moment for me.
If I had been put on the cheat mag and hadn't got off it quite quick, I don't think I would have stayed in that job. That wasn't what I was up for. That was more sort of working at Sony again.
Do you know what I mean, very, very meticulous and very structured and it was not a fun job.
You could tell. No, it was. And they were kind of isolated from the rest of the office a little bit.
It was it was tough. Yeah, it was.
And I don't think I just don't think it would have been creative enough for me. And I struggle a lot in non creative environments as I get such an asshole, but I'm an asshole. So it's fine.
And, and yeah, and it was just, you know, I remember how old it is. I remember getting the letter through the post. You've got the job.
That's so dumb. So, and again, because I knew that I wanted to do it, despite the money, despite having to move to Bournemouth, despite having to move in with uni students, because I didn't know where else I could actually afford at the time, I was like, I'm going to go, I'm going to go and I'm going to do this and we're just going to, and we're just going to see what happens. And yeah, I had a good feeling from day one.
I mean, the greatest thing about Imagine Publishing was the people that worked there. I mean, there were some difficult individuals for sure, but I don't like to focus on that because the positive individuals were awesome. Again, Sam, the fact that we're still talking here after all these years goes to show that there was some great relationships made.
Yeah, man.
17 years later.
Yeah. And also, I think it was a really good place to learn a craft, can make mistakes and yeah, sure, you're going to get in a lot of trouble, but it was still almost a local publishing house and I think there was a lot of leeway to sort of find your own way and make your own mistakes. And again, I still speak to you.
I still speak to, I don't want to stop dropping names because I forget someone, but at least five or six people from that time, which is crazy. That's absolutely nuts.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, man. I feel the same way too. I never look back on the pay and all that stuff and think I was hard done by it because it was early 20s and I thought, well, that's the time you're allowed to do something like that and figure out what you're supposed to be doing.
And yeah, like you, I just sort of, most of my longest term relationships have been sort of like, yeah, built off the back of Imagine. So yeah, I can, I completely agree, man. It's yeah, definitely ties for life forge there.
You went from staff writer on NRev to deputy editor in basically no time at all. I think you were running the magazine within six months. Yeah.
It was something like that. So A, how did that happen? And B, what was that like?
Well, I can't remember. I can't remember exactly. But I remember the person that was running the mag fell out with management and he left.
He just left and I won't drop names, but that guy has always been good to me. So it's one of those situations where, you know, sometimes personalities clash, but he always went to bat for me even way after that. So I can't, I can't be mad at him.
And I don't, I don't really know how it happened. I do remember. The only thing I really remember from it early on is somebody came to me and said, Simon, can you check the PDFs?
And I went, yeah, sure. And I turned to my designer and I said, what does that mean? I don't know what that means.
I explained it what it was and that was okay. And again, just because there was no one to run the magazine. There was no one there.
You know, let's say the guy left on a Monday, on a Tuesday, there was no one there. So my brain is just the way I've always thought about things as well. I'll just do it.
I'll just go sort out like I had a vague idea of what we had to do. So you know, I just started doing things. And when you start doing things, shockingly, a company would be like, man, he just doing it.
So just let him just just just let him go. But I don't know. It's very blurry when I think back on it now.
I do. I definitely remember being quite intimidated and stressed by it because I remember being at that awful uni house that I lived in. That was probably the worst part about it.
I didn't mind the money at all because again, no one made me take that money, right? I was appreciative of the opportunity and it was my choice. The house that I lived in sucked.
But I remember being upstairs and some news about Super Smash Brothers or something broke. I just remember getting so stressed out. Man, I got to fit that in the mag.
How am I going to fit that in the mag? So I don't think it was all peaches and cream and stuff. But a staff writer is the best job you can really do if you work on a games mag, because it's just that you get all the fun stuff mostly.
So while I did miss that, I guess I probably did like the responsibility. I like the idea that I could frame the magazine in the style that I wanted, because NRev, bless it, was the bastard child of Imagine Publishing. It didn't have the equity that some of the other magazines did.
So it was great to be able to tell people, man, be funny, just take the mic out of this stuff. That's what I would do. But it was very, very, very strange.
I remember the day I had a meeting and they said, we're going to make you games editor. But I was still running the mag. I was like, well, that's interesting.
But it was fine. Again, it gave me money. It gave me a pay increase and stuff.
But I suppose looking back now, that likely worked for me just because I've always, everything I've done has been built on a challenge. Can you do this? Oh, you failed a bit.
Well, how are you going to fix it and stuff? So that may have actually given me a bit more longevity. I'm not saying I would have got bored being a staff writer.
There's no way because it's such a good job. But I love the fact that all of a sudden I was thrown in at the deep end. But again, the fact I remember being stressed about Super Smash Brothers probably means it wasn't a totally fun ride.
But yeah, I remember for a while in terms of proper staff, it was just me and my designer. That was it. Just two people running a magazine that was like six months old, which is crazy.
It's absolutely nuts.
I remember you showed me a cover, your first cover, which was a My Sims cover. It was just a picture of a house. And I can't remember exactly what you said, but you said something along the lines of, it ain't much, but it's mine kind of thing.
And I was like, and I was like, fair dues. You always struck me as someone who did like being in control rather than being told what to do from the top. So I think that kind of makes sense.
But I was always curious, being made senior that early, did you ever get to love the process of making magazines? Because being editor is the part I enjoyed least in my career. It's all of the stress with less of the fun.
But I know you did it a lot younger than I did. What did you make of it?
Yeah, I think you're right. I think if there is a negative from the whole thing, it was, you know, I saw, especially when I moved to X360 and new guys were coming in and new guys were going. And all of a sudden I was the dude in charge of, where's this person going to go?
What's that person's going to do? That's when you realize, oh, I never got to do this because it just, well, I mean, I did get to do it. I think this is the thing.
Maybe it's just how life works. I got to go on the coolest press trip ever as my first press trip, which broke all press trips following that because I thought they were all going to be like this. It was like a proper first-class jaunt to Canada to play Scarface on the Wii, which is the most ludicrous thing.
But that's probably one of the press trips that broke the whole thing. Someone must have looked at those numbers, like what are we doing? This is insane.
So I did get to have that. So, you know, I can't pretend I was totally hard done by it, but you know, you're 100% right, Sam. It was, once I'd gotten into the process properly, and I, because again, when I first started doing it, I didn't know what I was doing.
I just learned on the ground. And yeah, that's when I realized, oh, you've kind of circumvented this part. But then there's the other side of your brain that's like, okay, great.
I hate this term, but everyone used it. This is my journey. I still don't know what it means.
But, and that's like, this is the way that I'm gonna go. So let's just make it fun for me. You know, like, not everyone gets to do this.
So that's the cool part of what you're doing. But yeah, maybe, because I didn't last as long as other people did. Maybe I did burn out a bit earlier than some.
I don't know. That's a good question. But I certainly did leave before others, yeah.
It's interesting because we basically started in the same job at the same time on our respective mags or stuff like in NGamer, what you were doing, NRevolution. And to see your ascent at imagine, like you couldn't help from afar, but go, oh man, I am really fucking up here. You know, like this isn't going the same way.
Something has gone wrong here. It's really interesting hearing like what was actually going on behind the scenes. Cause, you know, that's why I asked about the confidence.
Cause I just thought, man, did you just come in and just blow everyone away? And they were like, put this guy right in charge straight away. Cause I was not like that at all.
I find it fascinating that you said that because I never actually thought how it looked from afar. That's just straight. It was never something that ever entered my brain.
But I will say, I think one thing I probably did have going for me, which actually I think probably does tie into what you're talking about, is that I had, even though he could be a very intimidating fellow, I had no fear about talking to the boss. None, zero. Like if, you know, even though I was always prepared that it may, you know, you may say the wrong thing or you may not overstep the mark.
Cause I always tried to be professional. But I think that helped massively. Like I remember day one, I just went and talked to him because I was like, well, why wouldn't I do that?
So maybe there was sort of a part of me, a bit of a nuts part of me. And maybe that helped because then you do start forging relationships with the right people. And then, you know, when there is a bit of a crisis, which there was, it's like, well, you know, let's see if he can do it, I guess.
And maybe if I had remained, as it definitely was my first few days, the quiet, not really saying much, dude, they would be like, well, no, we can't give it to him. I like to assume I must have instilled some sort of confidence in them that I could do it. But yeah, that was definitely something that I always had.
I would just talk to people, always. I never backed down as I would just go and do it. So, but that's interesting to hear, man.
I never thought about that ever, how other people interpreted that. That's fascinating.
Yeah, and that's a very specific case to me. Like, you know, we were staff writers on the official Nintendo mags. They were, you know, a very specific job.
But you both went on to be wrestlers, and that's the important thing.
Well, there is that, there is that.
Yeah, the funny thing is, so Simon, I remember, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass, I just remember you being like the center of gravity in the office in this very specific way. Like, I remember when we had like some rock star party at that terrible Aruba on the pier in Bournemouth at the end of 2009, and like all of rock star were there, and they were, I remember they were just all like hanging on you every word, and then it was sort of like you were the center of the room, and everyone else is kind of like in various degrees away from it. Yes, true, you were never really afraid of talking to anyone.
I think everyone felt like they could approach you and talk to you as well. So a very specific thing, you're the popular guy, but you're also a very accessible kind of popular guy. So yeah, again, that just sounds like I'm blowing smoke up your ass.
But I guess what I'm trying to say is you had a very specific persona versus everyone else in games media who was a little bit more awkward, I guess. So yeah, I don't expect you to respond to that, but yeah.
Well, I'm very flattered by that, Sam, because I've never seen my way that at all. I really, really, really don't. So to hear that, look, I like to be as honest as I can, man.
That's a very nice thing to hear. So I appreciate that a lot. So thank you, dude.
Yeah, no worries. So after NRev, you moved to X360, which represented most of your imagined career. Can you talk about what running that magazine was like?
That is the best. Running X360, when we had the best team, that is my favorite memory of Video Games Magazine, because A, when I got moved across, I was excited, because as much as I loved NRev, we all knew that X360 was a magazine that had some, again, it had some credence, it had some life behind it, I suppose, and imagine liked it.
A team.
I had a team, yeah, exactly. But it was also the magazine that was expected to be the fun magazine. That was the persona that it had.
You have to have, it wasn't like Games TM or anything like that. They wanted it to be the antithesis of Games TM. So when I got moved across, I remember being so excited.
I was like, right, this is where we can finally really sort of paste a personality onto the thing. And yeah, when we had that team, when I just thought it worked from top to bottom, it is the most fun. And the amount of trouble we got in just by not giving a damn was my favorite thing in the world.
It was just, the amount of publishers I talked to, and they were like, why have you written this? I was like, because I thought it was funny. No, we didn't think it was funny.
I said, I don't care what you think. It made me laugh. That's all that matters.
And it was just, yeah, I really look back on the X360 days, especially because, look, we didn't change the world or anything, but we were very forward thinking when it came to podcasts and doing commentaries over DVDs and all of this. And certain features in the magazine, which basically now have evolved into what people do on YouTube and stuff. And again, I'm not saying that we invented it, but we were just very much like, oh yeah, we'll do that.
Why the hell not? And it was just the team, man, that everybody was on the same page, and everybody just wanted to have fun. And it was, yeah, no, I loved it.
I look back on those things now, and it's just, that really was the best. And I think once that kind of came to an end, maybe I just knew. I just, I peaked.
I'm never gonna be able to have this much fun again. I remember our direct boss turning around and saying to us, Sam, you're having too much fun. You gotta turn down the fun.
And I remember thinking, man, you guys just hate each other, don't you? Whereas we're all friends and getting on, and you don't like it. But it really was, in terms of my game, my game magazine stuff, it was the best.
And when it was doing really well for magazine standards at the time, there would be, I promise you, man, there was no other job. I mean, this would never have happened in a million years. But even if Edge had rung me up, Millie, you wanna come to Edge?
Nope. I'd run X360, damn it. Like, it felt like our magazine, and I loved that.
Like, it was just the, yeah, it was the best. And even when we had sort of, I remember Gavin used to do, he was always our in the spin freelance guy, when we took press releases and we just ripped them apart and explained what they actually meant. And anytime I would get a phone call from a publisher saying, why have you just taken our press release and ripped it to shreds?
You would go and share that with Gavin, who would also find it funny. It was just great. It was like, even the freelancers sort of were on the same page as well.
And I would say for a good year there, we would just, I can't remember what year it was, probably 2008, 2009 or whatever. I mean, to use a 2024 phrase, because we were just cooking. There was no one that could stop us.
And I still look back with a massive smile on my face. It was great.
Yeah, it was. You are right that we were kind of like, just if the publisher had the right sort of, you know, thought process about it, we could easily have been like a giant bomb or something like that. It was not, we were not a million miles away from doing it.
It just needed more investment than zero basically, which is what it had. So yeah, yeah, I completely agree, man. And yeah, you're right.
It was, oh, it was end of 08 to the end of 09 that I was on, I was on X360. And it was a great time. And I was absolutely heartbroken when I was moved to sci-fi now, because it was like not fun.
I was very, it was just piles of shit sci-fi books and writing about Doctor Who. It was a hard no-do.
I will tell you a story, man. I went to them and I said, what are you doing? I said that to them.
I said, what are you doing? Why would you break this team up? And I was told to F off.
And I was like, all right, fine. I thought they were crazy. I was like, man, again, what you just said, I thought we could have really made something of that.
And again, that wasn't their vision, which is fine. It's their company. I totally respect that.
But I just thought it was a crazy move. Again, having that kind of relationship between four or five people having people on the mag at the time is so rare and it's so hard. But everybody was just on the same page.
Everyone worked so hard too. It was great. It was really good.
I do miss the sort of writing of DVD captions as well, where we actually had a competition to write them the fastest. And then they would just come up. The most arranged shit would come out of it.
But we were like, no one's going to read this and they'll mostly be listening to the commentaries anyway. So we'll just write the most preposterous shit ever put down in about 15 minutes and see what happens.
We started to do that with the pictures as well. I remember there was an edict for a while. Don't write boring captions on pictures.
Come up with the most ludicrous stuff. And man, when I used to check the mag, I'd be in tears. It was so good.
And then surprise, surprise, I got told we weren't allowed to do that anymore. But it was just so, it was so good. It was like, it was a little bit like, you know, Garth Marenghi's Dark Place, the magazine, those captions.
It's just like, it doesn't mean anything. But that's why I loved it so much. It had real personality.
And that was my, always my favorite thing about games, journalism especially. If you did find that right, so yeah, like sort of unity between the team, you could make it work. And we had it, and I was so happy about it.
Yeah, man, absolutely. What do you remember about covering Xbox during that era? Did it seem particularly exciting or interesting to you while you're in it, especially because the PS3 was spinning its wheels and had a bumpy start to the generation?
Do you remember that the subject being interesting as well?
Oh yeah, and I always remember looking over at play and feeling a bit, not sorry for them. No one needs my sympathy. But I felt like we'd won, do you know what I mean?
We had won, we had won that war. Because it's all like, all the mega events were Xbox. I remember the Halo 3 event in the Netherlands where we got to go to, obviously Gears of War 2 was a massive deal.
I know everyone would get crazy when Gears of War 2. Gears of War 2 was the same for Forza. All these games were coming out that we got to cover.
And it was on the machine that everybody loved, despite the fact that those things didn't work. I always look back now and I find that incredible. Whole console, basically line that could break at any moment and nobody cared.
Don't worry about it.
Because it was that good. The games were that good. People were like, oh, it's fine.
I'll just send it back and it'll be all right. Yeah, yeah.
Even like the nonsense stuff, like when DLC started and we got horse armor, as stupid as that was for Oblivion, it was great for us because that was our humor. So we got to jump on that as well. It kind of just lay into it.
So no, I mean, I always see myself now more of an Xbox guy than a PlayStation guy. No, that doesn't mean anything. It's just words.
But it's because of how much I love the X360. That's what it was. I was having so much fun with the magazine and by proxy having so much fun with Microsoft themselves and all the games that were coming out.
I can't help but be that way because, you know, they're the memories that I have and they all tie up. But no, that was the best time to be working on an Xbox Mag. I say arguably more so than any other time, to be honest.
I think we hit it at its peak for sure.
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, it was exciting because it was like Gears 2 and Fable 2 launched at the end of 08 and Banjo-Kazooie, Nuts and Bolts and Viva Pinata, Trouble in Paradise. And then like it went into like Halo ODST the next year.
And then we were writing about Alan Wake and Crackdown 2. And yeah, there was just Halo Reach. It just seemed like there was always loads going on.
It was super exciting for sure. I was going to ask you about your memories with me, but I feel like you've covered it there, Simon. Is there anything that comes to mind when you remember this period or any particular sort of moments?
It's fine if it doesn't. It's a long time ago.
Oh, no, dude. Are you kidding me? Like, it was an absolute, just a dream to have you on that magazine because we thought the same way.
Do you know what I mean? It was one of these cool things where we thought the same way, but we would have minor differences that actually made it better because we could sit down and discuss stuff and be like, OK, maybe we should take it in that direction. And of course, because the podcasts and the DVD commentaries became such an important, I don't know how many people saw all that stuff, but to us became such an important deal.
The fact that we just had the same desire and the same approach with it, that you, me and Lynch could just, we could have sat there for 10 hours should we have wished, just come up with dumb content to talk about. And that's rare, man. I've done a lot of shows over the years and you can't, I mean, you can sort of build up chemistry with someone, but to have that kind of chemistry where it's almost instantaneous, where you can like, okay, cool, we can just go and do it.
No, dude, like I've always held you in high regard because of just the stuff that we were able to do. And I also remember just sat down if we got, you know, we'd get freelancer scores in. I remember we got some, I won't say who it was, but we got, it was, I can't remember if you were off the mag or not, but I definitely remember talking to you about it.
It was Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and it got 10. And I remember thinking, I think we should be giving Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to him. And I remember us sitting down and talking about it.
You basically going, yes, I was really stupid. And so we had to go tell the freelancer we were knocking it down to a nine and they decided they never want to do freelance for us again. I was like, all right, more for you.
Oh, that's because you and me, we were one of the, we were two of the reviewers who had reviewed the original Assassin's Creed and were some of the only ones who'd given it like quite mild scores.
Right.
Yeah. And then whenever it exploded with two, which was an actually good game, it was like, I think you and I were still like on watch for bad Assassin's Creed takes. So like, I think that's basically what happened there.
No, it's true. But that was great, man. It was good being on the same page.
So you leave Imagine in 2011 briefly, Simon, then come back as editor at large or as, or editor is large as Icomically called you all the time. I probably ran that joke into the ground. That's when we worked on the sporadic system linked podcast for the great now gamer.com.
What was that year or so like where you sort of, you came back, you'd gone, you'd come back and you were doing sort of like, you're sort of the London guy for a while, going to all kinds of events and stuff. What was that period like?
It was fun. It was good. Again, Imagine never had to let me back in.
So that really was them doing me a solid. Like I owe them a lot for that. Like I'd made a mistake basically in my professional life and bless them.
They had, you know, I had enough equity with them and I suppose vice versa that we came up with this role for me. Because again, personally at that time, I wasn't able to move back to Bournemouth. But again, these are all things that we learn as we grow up.
And it was good. You know, I got to go to a lot of events, which actually looking now in hindsight was very, it's very sort of positive for me because I made a lot more industry contacts, which have helped me no end going forward. But it was never the same because, you know, I was only down in the office once a week or whatever it was.
And, you know, it was the, again, it was the camaraderie and the fun that really made that job good. So the role was, you know, the role, I really appreciated the role and I think there was a lot to the role because I did do a lot of stuff in London, but it felt very much like really appreciate being back in the fold. But this doesn't have, given what Imagine Publishing were and what they wanted to do, I knew it had a shelf life which is one of the reasons why during that period I was really trying to push videos because I think that's what the role should become.
It should become the video guy, but that didn't really work out either. But again, without that sort of brief foray back into Imagine and us getting to do that podcast, I think by that point we really start to have fun with it and just go on these absolutely insane tirages I always enjoyed.
I think we did like three episodes about Homefront and every single one, we just like kicked Homefront's face off. Basically, I remember that being a good time, but yeah, it was good.
But yeah, so again, they were very, very good to do that to me, but it was always a role that was going to have a very, you know, it wasn't going to last more than a year or whatever it was, but it was good and I appreciate it.
Yeah, you were ahead of the curve on sort of in office, like hybrid working basically coming in like one or two days.
I was, I knew what was happening.
You knew COVID was coming eight years earlier. Okay, so let's take a quick break. But I've got a bunch more to ask you about working at THQ during the anti-Golden era for that company and a few other bits and pieces.
So yeah, we'll take a quick break and come back.
Thanks Welcome back to the podcast. So, got a load more to ask Simon about. He's done a whole bunch of stuff in his career, some really interesting bits and pieces.
One of those is that after, imagine, Simon, you went to THQ as PR manager during the collapse of that company, and when their assets were being sold off. I'm not saying you caused it, you know, far from it. I mean, we all saw what caused it in the run-up.
It was an interesting little window where Jason Rubin, one of the co-founders of Naughty Dog, joined the company and tried to save it creatively, basically, and make some good choices. But the clock had already timed out, basically. There's no more money left.
So what was it like being at a publisher as it was folding like that?
Well, I knew it was going to happen. This is the weird story that I will always tell. In my interview, I said, do you think the company is going to die?
And you don't ask that unless you're quite aware that the company is going to die. But I wanted to see what their take on it was going to be. But I'd left Imagine because I was just, I really wanted to get into doing more video stuff, which I know we're going to talk about later.
And it just wasn't happening. And then this opportunity with THQ came up. And they said you could be the PR manager on WWE.
Or yeah, WWE 13 it was. And that was very interesting to me because, you know, one of my weird mental bullet points was I want to, it wasn't massive fuss about being a PR manager, but I really wanted to work with WWE in some capacity because I thought it would present some opportunities that maybe would benefit me down the line. So I decided to take a risk on it because, like I said, I was desperate to do the video stuff.
It wasn't really happening. I was getting a bit frustrated. This came up and I thought, you know what?
Again, it's my hardheadedness. So let's just do it. The company dies, we'll deal with that as it was.
So I think I got about nine months there, something like that. It's definitely less than a year. And it was an absolutely the correct decision because it was only one day at the end of it.
Well, apart from all the people that I met that actually helped me a lot going forward. But in terms of the experience that I wanted, CM Punk, who's a very popular professional wrestler even today, was on the cover. I got to be his chaperone for the day.
I got to hang out with him. I got to stay in the hotel with all these WW wrestlers. I got to meet all of them.
I had breakfast with them. I had lunch with them. And as nerdy as that sounds, that's what I wanted.
That was the kind of experience I wanted. What would it feel like to be a WWE employee? And then soon after that game launched, you knew something was bad because you mentioned, Jason Rubinwright was his name.
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, because I remember we used to have weekly calls with him on a Friday, I think, or with the THQ higher-ups. Everything's fine, everything's fine. And then you go into the office and another person would be gone, another person would be gone.
And that last couple of weeks, it was just like four of us in the office being like, this is going very well, guys. So it was really, really strange. And I remember when the email came through saying, it's all done, and we were essentially told just to ransack the office, like just take whatever you want.
Which was so bizarre, but there was no money for someone to come in and clear it, right? The company was dead. So the best way to clear it was for us to take stuff.
So the WWE stuff was awesome, but when that was out of the way, I got to work on South Park, I'll stick a truth a little bit too, which was fun. But yeah, I remember it was very, very weird. And I remember having, I remember I was very calm about it all, which is strange.
Maybe I just thought this was, maybe deep down, I knew that it was gonna end this way. But yeah, it ended, like I said, after around about nine months, I just, I moved back in with my parents because I was like, well, I don't have any money and no one's paying me anything. So I guess I'll just go home for a while.
But even during that period, I remember I was, I'm sure I had a little bit of anxiety, but I just, I didn't regret my decision. And I think that was really important. Like I knew why I had gone there.
I knew what the risks were. And I got the, you know, I got the experience on the other side of the fence as well. I knew that I had my fill of it really.
But it was really, really weird. I remember the last week there especially was essentially just one big giant FIFA tournament. It was just a bunch of people playing FIFA because there was no work.
I remember being sent home early because they were like, well, there's no point in you being here, Simon. There's nothing to do at the moment because we don't know what's happening. There's a lot of don't knows, don't knows for a good month.
And then, yeah, sort of got the word sort of four or five days prior, this company's done. All of a sudden the weekly calls stopped and yeah, watched a company that I'd grown up with close in front of my eyes while I was part of it. Yeah, it was really surreal.
But what did you steal from the office out of interest?
So I had to make out that I was allowed to take it. There was definitely no theft or stealing involved.
Sorry, yes.
I got a 3D TV, which I never used because 3D TVs were crap. But it was a very good television all the same. And I remember I think I took a bunch of games, but I can't even remember what those games were.
Somehow I took Bioshock.
Darksiders 2 probably.
Well, I think that's what killed the company to be completely honest. But let's not worry about that. I somehow took Bioshock Infinite.
So somebody just must have had a copy because that's what I play. When I went back to my parents, I remember playing the Tomb Raider remake and Bioshock Infinite. That's what I played.
That may not be correct. I can't remember. But I guess there must have been a copy of that.
So I took that. And there was a bunch of WWE memorabilia. And I checked with everybody.
Nobody wanted it. So I thought, well, I'll have it. So yeah, I took that as well.
That was like a memento of my time. That's the way that I saw it. It was a pat on the back and mini bonus for doing nothing.
Yeah, absolutely. Like, you know, a severance fee for not being able to work there anymore because it doesn't exist. That seems fair, doesn't it?
So I remember you being very in demand at that time. Because I remember you told me, I've been offered three different jobs. I think this is when you were offered THQ.
One was at a PR agency. And one, I remember one was at videogamer.com and you were kind of noodling it. But you did THQ ultimately.
So you did go to VideoGamer after THQ. Did you want to go back to games journalism at that point? Did you feel like you had unfinished business?
Yeah, so I really, really, really debated THQ and VideoGamer because I'd had a chat with them. I really liked what they wanted to do. And this was, I was so desperate to do YouTube content then.
Like I really was. I was convinced this is what everyone should be doing. Why are people not doing more of this?
It's absolutely nuts. Which is why I went, I remember I had a meeting with Imagine once when I said we should take all the DVD commentaries we're doing and we should put them on YouTube. And they didn't want to do it, which I understand.
They want to package a DVD with a magazine. But I just felt like it was the wrong move. So VideoGamer, which obviously was a website, also had a YouTube presence already.
And again, I chose THQ because I wanted the WWE stuff. But again, very, very, super lucky, super lucky that as soon as they found that I was gone, they called me up and said, Simon, we'd still love to have you. And I was like, well, that's nice.
And yeah, it was a really, really, really good fit. Again, very Imagine like, I mean, obviously very, very small company, only sort of like six, seven people in the whole thing in a room in Croydon. But we wanted to do different things, wanted to try and shake up the industry if possible, wanted people to have fun, wanted to be irreverent.
So I can never say thank you to them enough. Like they could have gone, no, bro, you went somewhere else, but I must have sort of won them over in some regard. And looking back now, it's one of the best moves I'd ever made, because I got the best of both worlds.
So I can't be too mad about it.
That's good. So when you went there, did you, you basically had this opportunity to work on video that you'd wanted at Imagine, but didn't get it right.
Well, it was that. And again, I think I went in as editor in chief, whatever they called me. So I got to work on the website too, but I got to bring the ridiculousness to the website as well.
So I remember when Rambo the Video Game came out. I know it was the greatest thing ever, because it was so bad, it was good. You know, I said, rather than do a, I don't want to do a, but nobody wants to read a thousand word review of Rambo the Video Game.
So I said, can we just make one of those Venn diagrams where people just like follow it around? Well, this is why I love VideoGamer, right? We just sat down with the development team and they just figured out a way for the website to do it.
So it was chaos that place, but in the best possible way. And yes, they had this YouTube channel where they wanted everybody involved. They wanted everybody to have their own personality.
So, you know, we got to sit there and make so many daft videos. And we were allowed to troll people too, which I secretly like, I shouldn't admit that, but I love trolling the crazy people on the internet. And I remember one video I made with Chris Bratt, who obviously now does the people make games YouTube stuff.
You know, when the Tomb Raider, when Tomb Raider came out and it was just called Tomb Raider, well, the remake, whatever it was, we just played the original Tomb Raider and we just sat there going, it's not very good, is it, this remake? They barely tried and the amount of hate that we got from people goes, it's the wrong game, you idiots. We know it's the wrong game.
But honestly, it was just that constantly. And I loved it, I loved it. I loved the people that got it.
I loved the people that didn't get it. And everybody got on, like there was definitely some, you know, there were some times where there was a bit of animosity and stuff. But it felt very X360 to me because everybody was on the same page.
And it was kind of what I always wanted, that silly, like I say, irreverent stuff. But we got to do it visually now as well. We got to put it on YouTube, which I always thought was a good idea.
So yeah, I thought Video Game were very smart with how they approach things.
That makes sense. Funny thing is, Simon, the developer of that Rambo game, Teyon, the Rambo game was hated, but they made a Terminator game that was okay. And they made a Robocop game last year that was absolutely baller.
They're so, so good.
I saw that, I haven't played it. Yeah, see, I knew it. I believed in them from a young age.
You're like, this Venn diagram will inspire them to greatness, basically. That's good. Yeah, so I felt like the thing I always remember, the troll I always remember from VideoGamer is when the Order 1886 got six out of 10, but it was a nine that spun around and then into a six and then a deal with it gif.
It had like Steve Burns fingerprints all over it, but were you also behind that? Were you part of that whole thing?
I was, it was definitely a Burns Miller collab. So my dream when I was working on magazines is I wanted to give a Rockstar game a zero and then say the one must have fallen off when we were checking the PDFs. Because the point I wanted to make was nobody is reading this stuff anymore.
So I wanted this glowing review and then I wanted it to be zero just so everybody would go nuts. They would never let me do it. So when the order came out, I was like, well, no, it's really a phrase that I told everyone if anyone could ever come up with the one falling off on a PDF for this video game, I will do it.
I will sign off and I will take the heat. And it just so happened it came up and yeah, Burns was like, we could do this. I was like, absolutely, we can do that.
And I loved it. People were so mad. People were so, it's just so angry for no reason whatsoever.
So yeah, and it was just stuff like that all the time. Like it's just constantly writing a review and then going, well, how can we change this? And what can we do to make it different?
And it just made it fun. And that's what all I really ever wanted was I wanted the website to be fun so people could enjoy it. Cause I always feel like if you're having fun, other people will be having fun.
So yeah, I look very proudly on this stuff. That's the immature side of me. Just like, so.
No, it makes it definitely like got a rise out of people and people were talking about it. That was the thing. So yeah, it was definitely, and it's not really anything like that in games journalism now.
So, you know, I do get it. I guess on the same line, Simon, you created a variety of fictional characters when you were, when you were a video gamer. It felt like the Miller Report was a proper moment in time for UK games journalism.
A sort of exaggerated version of yourself acting alongside your video gaming colleagues. This podcast in some ways is sort of a different version of it, really. It's kind of like a UK games industry focus sort of thing.
But obviously we're, we're just sort of two polite men recording on audio. But it's like something hyper, hyper UK focus with a bit of old magazine energy. So what was it like to making the Miller Report?
Where did that whole thing come from?
So it's such a ridiculous story. We obviously, again, you guys will both get this. We are being offered a lot of preview content and developer interview content and it was okay.
But it wasn't doing any sort of numbers. And it was all the same as everybody else, which is nobody's fault because we, you know, everybody was locked in by what the PR said they could talk about. Is it going to have unlike component?
Can't talk about it. What about sequel? Can't talk about it.
What about multiplayer? Can't talk about it. It's like, this is just dull.
So I just sat down with everybody one day and I said, listen, I think we should just do something completely different. I think we should just, we should get content that nobody else can do it. And I think the best way we can do that is with satire.
So I said, every video from now on out should be satirical. Now don't get me wrong. If you go back and watch the videos now as a collab, you know, I was the person that said, I think we should sort of, and Matt Lees was as well.
Matt Lees, you know, Matt Lees with his, the videos he did for the E3 press conferences when he sort of did it in bite size chunks. That's what really, you know, that did so well. And it was so funny that I think Matt had gone by that point, but I was like, we need to tap into this a little bit more.
So with my love of professional wrestling and my love of characters, you know, my thing that I wanted to do was ridiculous interviews with developers because that way we would have content that nobody else would do. So we also thought we should have a weekly show because everybody had a weekly show. So of course we came up with Piss Morning, which is the most UK, I mean, in hindsight, what a stupid thing to do.
I very much doubt that anybody in the USA knew what this morning was. And it was a bad video. It was really bad.
It was not well edited. We did not think it out. But the thing that got a bit of traction was The Miller Report when it was just me screaming like the, it was based on sort of American, like stock market people, not really stock market people, but there was a bunch of American videos at the time of people taking very, very mundane subjects and trying to spin them into these sort of crazy events.
So we did one about DLC and how DLC was gonna kill your kids and you have to like hide away from DLC. And in the comments, that was the thing that got the most traction. Now, if I'd known that was gonna happen, I never would have called the character Simon Miller, I would have called it something else, but we didn't know.
So we made another one. I remember all of this because I enjoyed it so much. I think this was Burns' idea.
I guess we should do one about frame rates. They said it should be 30 frames versus 60 frames. And then I was like, yeah, we should just turn it into a big wrestling match.
So we just did this. We did this thing where it starts off with a very, a relatively serious debate about 30 versus 60. And then it ends with proper WWE fight in the kitchen of VideoGamer with Jim commentating over the top like he is a famous commentator called Jim Ross.
And from that point on, again, it got, that was, again, it didn't blow up in terms of millions of views, but for us it did very well. And I think, you know, a lot of people within the industry liked it as well, which we took as, we took real pride in that because, you know, they're our peers and it's nice to be doing something different. So around that time as well, we got invited to a paintball day for some game.
And so we just thought, well, we can actually go, we can go and do a proper on-location shoot and we can call it real life versus video games. And yeah, Jim and I just turned it into this most, most ridiculous skit where, you know, the Miller Report character thinks it's real and Jim's his cameraman trying to explain, dude's just firing paintball at people. And it was fun to do, people enjoyed it.
And after a while, we used to release them on Tuesdays, you know, if you were late or it was delayed, people would be like, where's the Miller Report? So we thought, okay, well, we need to, we need to take this as far as we can go. And eventually he got killed, he came back as a Mexican luchador.
We just, we went to that game, award ceremony in character, which I kind of cringe about now, but hey, we did it. So I think it was just one of those things. It kind of ties into what we just said.
We were having real fun with it. And I stood at this day, think we could have made it even bigger if publishers had gotten on board, but publishers really didn't like it, which I do understand because they thought we were taking the mick out of them, which was not the case. We just wanted to do something different, but I won't name the publisher, but I remember I got an email after, I had sent out these big emails to everyone trying to explain what The Miller Report was and we could work with you.
And Nintendo were great with it. I mean, Nintendo loved it. Like we did one video that actually did take off.
It was called like 10 Reasons The Wii U's For Babies. And they told me off, I mean, this was years ago now, they weren't care. It's a different team.
They told me off the record, look, publicly, we can't support this, but keep doing it. This is great for us. This is the kind of content we can't do.
And people are talking about the Wii U. We don't care. Whereas somebody else replied to one of my emails and they were like, Simon, just so you know, we will never collaborate with this content with you.
Goodbye.
That first person who messaged you was Shigeru Miyamoto, right? Just saying.
That's right. He probably would have got it to be fair. But, and that was the issue that we ran into.
I remember there was an event, oh, I think it was for Spyro when Spyro came back. And yeah, I think it must have been Activision. You know, they told us, we can't invite you along because we don't know what you're going to ask the developer.
Like we don't trust you. And I was like, well, I'll tell you, I'll send you my questions. And they're like, no, no, we can't have you.
So we ran afoul of the industry after a while, which I always took great pride in. I thought that was, I thought that was a badge of honor in many ways, but yeah, it was a really, it was just a really fun time. And it was just cool that people liked it mostly.
I never thought it would spawn however many episodes it did. I want to be very clear, it's not like it blew up or anything. It wasn't doing millions of views, but within our little niche that we had, it was a very enjoyable thing to do.
And it just, you know, if it, nothing else, it cemented my love for YouTube that I already had and I wanted to double down in. So yeah, I'll never be too mad at it.
Yeah, man, absolutely. So what was running videogamer.com like more generally? Do you find it easier or harder than making magazines?
I mean, it's different. It was certainly just, again, we talked about that Super Smash Brothers story. You had time to sort of figure that out.
Whereas, you know, when you're working on a website, it would have to, how are we gonna do, you've got to do stuff now, very much a reactionary, you know, reactionary based thing. And of course you try to do video, you try to do content for the website. You're also trying to be creative.
Also, it was a small business. You're trying to make money, trying to make money too. So I'd say it probably was a lot more stressful.
But I also, I think just because it was just videogamer.com with eight people, you did have, it did feel like it was everyone's baby a little bit because everybody knew that if they didn't do their job, there was no one to pick up the slack. So everybody sort of had to have their own input. But I think what I lucked out with, again, it was just a group of really, really good people.
And they were fun people. And nobody didn't like the direction we were going in. So there was a lot of support on all levels.
But yeah, I was more stressful. I mean, stressful in a different way, for sure. But I think mostly for me, when I look back, because I was so happy to finally be doing the YouTube stuff, which I think Video Game was like 2013 or 2014 or whatever it was.
And I wanted to make YouTube content like 2010, 2011. So to finally get that opportunity to do it on for what was, for me at the time, a much bigger stage, I think that just kept me going. And again, they were well into podcasts.
And it wasn't the case of, oh, we just won't do the podcast today, we don't really have to do the podcast. A podcast is part of the schedule. And I just loved all of that.
It was all the stuff that I wanted to do, interactive, fun, stupid. And I've never listened to them back. I'm sure I'd be mortified.
But I liked the fact that we got to do it. And we had the support of the people running the thing as well. They wanted to do that too and they believed in it.
So it was just a good few years. And I think we probably started and ended at the right time as well. I think when everybody left, they, yeah, I think people had very good intuition for that stuff.
It's kind of crazy to me how you've all gone on to do very different things, but all very sort of successful in your own spheres, you know? Like VideoGamer, I think, you know, both your era and writers beforehand was quite a good sort of incubator for people, you know? It's sort of a little underrated in that regard.
Yeah, no, I think you're right. I mean, you know, Cam and Seb, look what they went on to do. I mean, they totally flew.
And obviously Matt Lees, you know, he came in and he set the place on fire and he did his thing too. So yeah, I don't want to start naming names because I'll forget people. But no, it's true.
And I remember there was a time when people sort of described video internally, obviously, in terms of in terms of the industry, almost described VideoGamer as like, you know, you find the best new talent and then they move on, they move on to do something else. And I know that was definitely an atmosphere that they wanted to change. And I would argue that when we all left, it was actually more the beginning of the end overall, as opposed to sort of people moving on.
But yeah, it's great to see that everybody used it as a platform because that's better than, you know, people falling down and yeah, everyone is still doing great. So that's really cool.
So what led to you moving on from VideoGamer ultimately, Simon, do you think the Miller Report side of things might have worked as its own independent Patreon project or something similar? I mean, I know that you did some crowdfunding stuff. I wonder if you were slightly before the era where that was like more accepted as a way to support creators.
Do you think there's a different trajectory that could have gone on?
Yeah, no, I was ahead of the game and I would have done it totally different in hindsight. But also I think if we were gonna do it, we needed the team, we needed everybody. And people just wanted to go and do different things.
Like I think it just ran its course. But no, I do think if we had actually sat down and gone, let's turn this into its own thing and gone off, that would have worked. But at the time, that's not what people, I think at that point, people were a little bit confused about what to do next.
I remember having a big discussion about it with everyone and we weren't 100% sure. I mean, I actually made a huge mistake there because I remember other people like, we should just turn it into a sitcom in the office. And I remember thinking, I don't know if that works.
And actually I think it would have worked. I think I overthought it. But at the same time, yeah, it would have worked.
I think it would have worked if everybody was there because that's what people like. People like all the characters interacting with one another. Like it was called The Miller Report just because by happenstance, there was nothing to do with me.
It was everybody, everybody working together. And I think that's why when I tried to, I mainly tried to do it just because I thought, well, I mainly left just because I was very lucky in the sense I was getting offered a lot of content by other companies. And I couldn't do that within VideoGamer as nor I should be able to.
I was just one of those things where I kind of thought, maybe this is a time to, I just like, as given I left Imagine twice, I just like trying new things. And I like challenging myself. And I like being uncomfortable.
I like uncomfortable situations because I usually find if you're uncomfortable, you're probably onto something or you're at least gonna learn something about yourself. And I'm not scared of failing, as stupid as that sounds, but I'm not. I think you learn a lot about yourself there, too.
So I knew that Jim and Burns had had thoughts about starting a production company. That wasn't really something I wanted to do. So I thought they were gonna leave.
Maybe I should leave. And then when I started to get offers from outside of video game projects, too, I just decided, you know what? I'm just gonna do it.
And if it all goes wrong, it all goes wrong. And we can think again. But I just, again, I've always trusted my gut.
And my gut was like, I think this is the time to do something new. I think staying there would have been great, but I'm not sure it would have opened other doors, which I was quite interested in. And as there were opportunities, I thought I would explore them.
And so yeah, I just did it. I just one day woke up and went, right, I'm gone. I just left.
Oh, fair enough, man. I do get it, the idea of something running its course and moving on. I mean, it would never stop us from making this podcast, but you don't like it, so.
You just do it forever. You just do it until you run it into the ground, then you run it into the ground some more, yeah.
When we're doing the Atari Jaguar draft or whatever, then I think we've definitely run out of steam then, but yeah, that makes sense.
Well, I look forward to it.
So these days you run your own company and do presenting for a variety of places, Simon. How are you finding this phase of your career? It sounds like it's a pretty exciting one.
It's nuts. I mean, it's truly, it's truly nuts. I don't even know, I don't like the term content creator or influencer.
I hate those terms. I won't use them, but I don't know what my job is. I guess it's a YouTuber.
I don't know. I mean, the thing is, I always wanted to have my own little success on YouTube. And it's cool that I've got a little piece of that.
You know, and the fact that it's in professional wrestling is a nice surprise too. I never thought I'd be able to combine those two things after I done video games. So I feel super lucky that I've been able to make that work.
But yeah, as I get to do that, so, you know, I couldn't be, it's like wrestling has thrown up on me these days. I couldn't be more involved if I tried. But you know, it's one of those, I mean, this is the reason why I'm happy that I made the jump, because if I had never made the jump, I never would have found the resting side.
Without the resting side, I never would have started wrestling and doing the resting, then open the door to acting and open the door to go to America and all these kind of things. So I'll never regret it ever. But it's true, I get to wake up every day and have a thousand different things that I get to do.
Like there are some video game stuff that I still do. I mean, it's mostly with publishers, but that's fine. I really enjoy it.
I get to do a lot of voiceover work, which is nice, especially because I imagine people used to yell at me for how much my voice carried. So that's a nice F you to those guys. I'm making money off it now.
And then there's the YouTube stuff, and there's the bespoke YouTube stuff, and there's the individual YouTube stuff I do. And again, I get to go wrestle at weekends. I've wrestled in America.
I've been on all of these tours. And it all comes from the fact that one day I just decided I'm gonna go out on myself and see what's going to happen. And the fact that sort of the catalyst to it all and the centerpiece to it all is YouTube, which 14 years ago I believed in.
I really, really, really did. I sat down and imagined numerous times that, man, and they looked, they helped me, man. They got me a camera and I got to go.
I remember I interviewed Rod Ferguson and I interviewed Cliffy B. I did all of this kind of stuff. But I don't think, they were probably right in hindsight.
They didn't want to invest in it to the level that I did. But the fact that I sort of had that inkling in my stomach and decided to go with it, and now it's the core of my business is, I guess it's just a nice way to go, oh, you were correct, it was the right thing to do. And like I say, it's given me experiences that I never dreamed I'd be able to go on.
And it's all to do with the people that support me on those platforms, which I also find very humbling. Like there's many days where I'm like, I don't understand why people are even watching this or what they get from it. But it's awesome, and it's June the 25th now, so I'm just a month removed from being out in the States for two months.
I never did I think I'd go away for a different country for eight weeks, and somebody would even want to sort of support me to do that. So yeah, I'm very lucky to do what I do, and every now and then I still get people coming up to me and saying The Miller Report's catchphrase, which makes me laugh every single time. And even when they announced the new gears, I had people tweeting me, because that was The Miller Report's favorite game, because it was my favorite game.
So I still get people, they tweeted me about it. That was 10 years ago, and they still tweet me saying, Simon, do you think it's going to be a real game? And I was like, that's such a niche reference, no one is going to understand what you're talking about.
And I do, I find that super humbling. I find it humbling that people care. And I often have to sort of stare off into the distance and try and process this.
But yeah, no, it's a super cool thing to do, especially because I can wake up tomorrow and whatever I've got on my slate, because then all of a sudden it becomes something completely different. And I think that's fun. And my big thing was always never regret anything.
If I'm lucky to live to 80 years old, which is very unlikely, but let's keep our fingers crossed. I just, I don't mind failing at something, but I never wanted to regret anything. And I like to think I've attacked enough things I've always wanted to do that that won't happen.
And that to me is, that's the real success of everything. But we gave everything a go. And there's more stuff to give a go as well.
We're certainly not done, but yeah, I never feel like I'm going to work, which is the dream.
Great stuff, Ben. Yeah, like I'm glad to hear it. I kind of wish that we had TikTok back when we were making magazines.
I think we would have been, we could have done some great stuff with that platform, but yeah, it is what it is. But yeah, that's really cool to hear. And yeah, it is always interesting to me to like look on your Instagram and just see that you're at another wrestling event or just a huge number of followers you've got, you've garnered from sort of like wrestling based platforms and your appearances and stuff like that.
So it's just nice seeing that you're out there doing stuff. That's just like, it's just a good thing.
I appreciate it, man. That's super kind of you, dude. I genuinely try to appreciate it and be humble every single day, which is something to say.
You can't be humble if you say you're being humble. But I mean, there's stuff going on right now with YouTubers, right? Where you're like, man, you're scum.
And I never wanna be that person. And I always wanna appreciate it. So it's really cool to hear stuff like that, man.
But again, it's YouTube, it could all die tomorrow. So I'm just gonna enjoy it as much as I can every day.
I'll get you, man. So yeah, thanks so much for coming on, Simon. Where can people catch you on social media?
Well, depressingly, they can find me at SimonMiller316, which is a wrestling reference. But I set this account up in 2007. And I never would have put 316.
It's like the Miller Report all over again. Had I known what was down the line, I'm not gonna put 316. It's so nerdy, but hey-ho.
What does that mean?
So it's a Stone Cold Steve Austin reference.
Oh, okay. Is that like the Bible verse thing?
That's right, yes. So Stone Cold Steve Austin was taken on a guy that, in his promo, had dropped a Bible verse. So Steve Austin, because wrestling is, you know, low brow entertainment, said, you know, you can, you know, you talk your Bible verses, you can say your prayers, blah, blah.
But Austin 316 says, I just whooped your ass. And it became the best-selling t-shirt of all time. So when I was setting up a Twitter account and, you know, Simon Miller was taken, I thought, oh, I'll be Simon of 316.
That'll be funny. Which is kind of weird, really, because I'm sure if you're religious, you should be really mad at me. And I am quite a religious guy.
So it's a very interesting take on the whole thing. But yeah, that's where I am. If you just search for my name, you know, you'll be able to find me.
And if you're super into wrestling, you can go to What Culture Wrestling as well, and you can find all my wrestling stuff there.
Awesome, man. Yeah. And I did want to ask you, actually, are you excited about E-Day?
Is that an exciting thing for you, the new gears?
Dude, I was at a wrestling event and I was watching that streaming on my phone because I'd done everything I needed to do that day. And man, when that trailer dropped, I was 15 years old again. That is the most excited I've been out of a game because, listen, Gears of War 4 and Gears of War 5, they are fine video games, but they ain't no Gears 1, 2 and 3.
They're just not. They're just not. Different team, different approach, different characters.
So when I realized what they were doing and they had the music and, oh man, I'm so excited. So that's going to be the first game in ages that I like book off work or whatever I'm doing. I'm just sitting there and playing it.
I still love Gears of War. I love Gears of War so much, it's ridiculous. And again, Gears 4, Gears 5, perfectly fine, but they didn't have the same impact.
So as soon as I saw that trailer and the fact they said we're going to do this, we're going to do that, it's a brand new team, we've got some ideas, they're going to tie it to the old ideas. I was like, yes, yes, this is what I want in my life. So don't disappoint me, Microsoft.
Make it the greatest game ever. I'd really appreciate it.
Okay, good stuff, man, it was a pleasure having you on, so thank you so much. And yeah, if you want to follow the podcast, we have BackpagePod on Twitter and Bluesky as well. And you can find us at patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us as well.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
MrBazzill underscore pesto on Twitter, MrBazzill pesto no underscore on Bluesky.
And I'm Samuel W Roberts on both those platforms. Thank you so much for listening, and we'll be back next week. Goodbye.
