Hello and welcome to the Backpage XXL, a patron exclusive episode. Of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew. Pearl and Dean. Who the fuck are they? How you doing? It's it's movie time.

Matthew
00:41
Did you see the did you see a Perland Dean advert during these film festivals?

Samuel
00:46
No, I saw no adverts at all during these film festivals.

Matthew
00:48
I haven't heard the Perl and Dean tune for like A decade probably.

Samuel
00:52
Yeah, they used to play it at Gun Wolf Keys, uh the old uh view, Warner Village uh back in the day there. But um Do you remember the one at the OGN goes

Matthew
01:01
B Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Samuel
01:05
Do you remember that one? No, I don't know that one. Um but uh that they played that one in Bournemouth. Uh maybe it was like a maybe it's further back than the Oh right, I don't know. I just get I get the Odien adverts now are like it's time and then there'll be a woman with a magic ball or some fucking magician loser with a stick and a hat.

Matthew
01:27
They all they all look like they should be in um Zion in the Matrix.

Samuel
01:32
Yes, exactly. That's very true. But um they're less sweaty than the people in Zion. Hey ho. Um yes, I don't really know why I started with that, Matthew. Um, how are you doing? Are you okay? It's Sunday evening. We've both seen a lot of films for this episode, yeah.

Matthew
01:45
I well I came out of my last film about forty minutes ago and in that subsequent time I've bought a Schwartz Brothers, basically inhaled a Schwartz Brothers. And then now podding, so we've got a bit of digestion going on, both of the film I just saw and the burger.

Samuel
02:02
Very good. Um I'm s I'm sure you'll hear uh yeah, various gurgles relating to at least one of those um throughout this pod. Um yes Matthew, we have been to uh two film festivals, which is very exciting. I think we've ha we've had a particularly actually you know what, you used to go to Bar Film Festival way before me. But this year we both went to London Film Festival. Um both uh you know, both did two days there and we've both been raiding Baths Film Festival. It feels unusually strong for the amount of you know, Oscar worthy films you can see early, right? Is it is it just me or is this a particularly strong year?

Matthew
02:35
Yeah, it feels so. I I think it particularly helps Bath had a lot of the good stuff that was also at London, so it just it felt quite rich. Felt like you could sort of cross book across the two of them and end up with quite a nice selection. So uh and it also drew it out. You know, it's felt you know it feels like I've been watching quite good films for like the last three or four weeks.

Samuel
02:55
Yeah, man, so many. Um it's sort of um it's been hard to contain it all in my brain to be honest. Not all of them I have like red hot takes on either, because some of them need to simmer. And some of them, frankly, blokes don't really have uh much to say don't really have much of a relevant perspective on necessarily. Um certainly one of those I'm I'm really alluding to there. Um but yeah I uh I really enjoyed it. I I started going to these things a couple of years ago. Dave Scarborough bought tickets for Maestro and Priscilla in 2023. And I thought it was a good like post-COVID, both the cobwebs off kind of thing to get involved with. And now I want to go over here and I think I'm gonna get a BFI membership next year and try and book my own tickets. Dave booked all of ours again this year. Um I really owe Dave Scarborough a lot for my participation in this. But um Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be an amazing OSCE year, is my my sort of feeling out of out of like watching a lot of these. Not in the sense that these films are not good necessarily, but that I think that maybe the very highest end OSCI years we've had post-COVID. Uh it just doesn't feel like there's the same doesn't feel like there's gonna be a five-star film among them, you know? Did you get that feeling too?

Matthew
04:01
Uh yeah, I mean I guess there are there are a couple of films that I really like that probably aren't going to be obvious Oscar contenders just because they're like foreign language films, for example. Um but yeah I've I've saw some good performances. I saw lots of Lots of the films had Oscar worthy like elements to them, whether they're like the craft or the performances. But yes, maybe you're right in that not many of them were the all round like, oh well that's the best picture contender right there, you know?

Samuel
04:29
Indeed. Well, I think Matthew, let's just get into them because I think that You know, the hope is that from this episode you'll get a bunch of stuff that you might want to go check out. And if you don't fancy checking them out, maybe you'll you'll find these interesting, note them, and then maybe watch them down the line when they end up on a streaming service or something. However, you want to use the episode is up to you. But yeah, we thought since we both did like this deep dive, it was worth getting into. I think Matthew's watched one or two more films than I have, but um Until we've watched I think uh more than ten films here um between us. So yeah, plenty to dig into and all kind of from this year's you know awards season.

Matthew
05:04
And uh yeah, yeah, we won't talk too much. Spoiler free Yeah, absolutely. We also we don't ha I I don't think a lot of these necessarily have a firm release date, so I'm I'm not gonna be doing that.

Samuel
05:15
Yeah, and there's a few that have actually come out or about to come out. So um i you know some will be uh more immediately useful than others. If you want to know what the films are, I'm going to put them all in the episode description so you can you can see. But like Matthew says, we'll avoid spoilers and just talk about the very kind of top line and what we think of them, really. So uh I guess Matthew we'll start off with um uh this is a pretty exciting one to start off with and I'm sure probably one that's the most relevant to our listeners or the the most listeners who are hearing this have seen. You know, seen that film or have the most interest in it. Um I'm really talking around it here. Detective Benoit Blanc sifts through a series of suspects when a Monsignor turns up dead. This is the third film in the Knives Out trilogy, Wake Up Dead Man. Only Matthew has seen this one. Obviously, it is coming out on Netflix before the end of the year. So I'm sure a lot of people uh will be watching this at home with relatives this year. Um certainly that's what I did with my family during Glass Onion. Um my mum said that wasn't very good. And we um do something else. Cracking Christmas, that was. Um so Matthew, you've seen this, you are, you know, the murder mystery expert. You're a bit more kind of uh in touch with the influences on um on Ryan Johnson's films than I am. Um what did you make of Wake Up Dead Man?

Matthew
06:26
Uh I liked it a lot and I think part of that's down to watching this film i you know in a cinema environment with an absolutely massive audience. Uh I won't I won't repeat this for every entry. because it's sort of true of all of them, but this one I thought it it was most pertinent. Like it's been so long since I've actually seen a film in a room with you know, a packed room of people who are really up for it and like really tuned into it. And you know, particularly at the London Film Festival, you know, you're in a room with maybe, I don't know, 2,000 people? Like there's loads of people in there And it's uh it's a it's a real crowd pleaser, you know, it's it's got you know big brash comedy, you know if you're familiar with these films, Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc is like an absolutely preposterous character. but also they're surrounded by a sort of network of of suspects and villains and victims who are all quite c I I'd say like comedy leaning, uh, in a slightly sort of satirical way. Interestingly, Uh Daniel Craig actually doesn't come into this film until quite late in, later than you'd expect. And it it really is like the Josh O'Connor show. I think that was my main takeaway from it. was that Ryan Johnson has talked about these films being very flexible and him wanting to approach different mystery types in different entries. This one here, you know, the th the the whole shape of the thing is very different in that it it's more about this priest played by Josh O'Connor who kind of invites Ben Mau Blanc to solve a mystery and ends up being his sidekick but it honestly felt to me like like Daniel Craig was more of a sidekick to him and you just sort of saw like what a what a good kind of leading man he is and you know, i if you're familiar with Josh O'Connor's stuff in, you know, m more indie fair, it's quite interesting to see him in this more mainstream thing, like just very credibly carrying a lot of the film. Hard one to talk about without spoiling it. I don't even want to say like who dies in this because it feels like that's kind of part of the fun, sort of seeing how it unfolds. But Uh it's a good cast. I'd say it's closer in tone to the first one than Glass Onion. Slightly less frivolous. The characters it's targeting are a little bit m uh uh he's a little bit more sort of scalpel sharp in his observations. I thought they were quite broad in Glass Onion, you know, it was all sort of YouTubers and to tech bros and i a little bit tired well this group were naturally a a kind of more subtle bunch. He definitely likes having Daniel Craig say funny things in that southern accent. They feel like the biggest spoilers really. Like there's there's just he says something in this film which is so not in keeping with the character and you're like it it's just like a sort of boil in the bag meme happening and I think I think Brian Johnson is definitely guilty of that in this film. Like he knows like Oh those will be the five memes. But yeah, I liked it. Talked a lot about Mystery Craft. You know, there's there's quite a lot of talk in the film about locked room mysteries and the nature of them and the the problems with them and that's obviously like, you know, sort of uh W what's the oh god, I'm so full of burger, Sam.

Samuel
09:44
Um I'm gonna say you when you said boiling the bag meme, I thought Surely like Schwartzbrough's meme that you've yomped down after watching Die My Love.

Matthew
09:53
Um Well I'd say catnip, that's the phrase I was looking for. This is like catnip for me. You know, it it really engaged with the mystery stuff. So uh I yeah, I I think um I think a lot of people will have fun with this on like Christmas Day or whatever. Yeah, it's a good it's a it's a it's a pretty good laugh, pretty good mystery.

Samuel
10:10
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I think, you know, uh like you say, there was something a bit tired about about Glass Onion, as if, you know, you want to just scream at Ryan Johnson, please delete Twitter off your phone and stop letting it infect your the pop culture you make because Guess what, Looper and Brick would not be better films if they had fucking, you know, like an alt-right bloke in it or whatever bullshit or like a somebody's got an OnlyFans account. Like just get off of social media. So I'm pleased to hear that's the case. The cast is really, really good um in this one. Um Josh O'Connor's got sort of like uh several modes. He's got sort of like Lacamera the mastermind sort of like looks a bit annoyed, um, sort of like lonely man mode. Yeah. And then he's got sort of like Sexy Prince Charles mode. As deployed in Challengers and the Crown. They're not really the same mode, those two. And then I don't really know what this is, but it looks like it splits the difference a bit between what he does in something like Lacamera and um and challengers. It looks like it's a it's a bit lighter, you know, than uh certainly than Lacamera was.

Matthew
11:17
Yeah, it's c it's quite it's quite a big performance. Like he has to kind of hold a lot of it together and he's quite a manic presence. um as this like yeah priest who's kind of s you know struggling with his faith a little bit and and his kind of congregation. Um but i y yeah I mean i he really does hold it together. Um It's good it's quite interesting because all all of these films, you know, each one partners Daniel Craig with someone with quite interesting, you know, Anna Delamas in the first one, and um oh the singer in the second one. Yes. Um uh so yeah like that that's you know it's it's quite fun to see you know which person is gonna be his next sidekick if they make another of these. Um I d I think that probably the only downside to these films is the casts are so stacked every time that there's always a couple of people who get a little bit of like overlooked in the mix. Um Renner? Does Renner get a good a good run in this? No, Renner gets a pretty good run in this. Glenn Close gets a pretty good run in this. Um Uh and I'd say Andrew Scott and Kylle Spenny are a little bit a little bit secondary in this one.

Samuel
12:28
Yeah Interesting. Well, um I will ask one last question on this one. This is discuss this longer than I think we'll talk about the others. Yeah. I think just because people will know the most about this, the background of this, and probably therefore be the most interesting to people. But um Do you think they should make more after this? Or do you think that it's they should like tie a bell on it here? Because it sounds like there's interest in making more of these from Ryan Johnson. Don't know about Daniel Craig, but I would imagine if the money is as good. They want to keep doing it.

Matthew
12:57
Yeah, I I I would happily, you know, watch an endless number of these. I think it is ridiculous that, you know, these two films came out of like a what is it like a 500 million deal or something? And you're like, it just doesn't feel like that that much money's on the screen ever. Outside of like having these amazing casts and I guess Daniel Craig is quite expensive after bond. But um proper COVID madness to that those numbers. Yeah, yeah. So I I you know It's kinda I don't I don't know if they're c like uh not that it's for us to decide what what these things are are not worth but you know or that it particularly matters but I do balk at that a little bit, but I, you know, I hope he finds a way to carry on doing this. Um, though I'd also take an original film from him because Brian Johnson's pretty good at coming up with film ideas.

Samuel
13:46
Mm, very good. Alright, well uh yeah, I'll look forward to watching that. And uh I'll probably try and catch that. This is what I did with Glass Onion. They Showed it in the picture house near us for a week before it hit Netflix, so that might be good. But then I just know I'll have to watch it again at Christmas.

Matthew
14:01
There is that.

Samuel
14:02
And hear my mum complain about it again at Christmas. Hopefully she'll like the the third one more. Um okay Matthew. My first film then, you've not seen this one, I don't believe. That uh is Roof Man. with Channing Tatum. After escaping from prison, former soldier and professional thief Jeffrey Manchester finds a hideout inside a Toys R Us. surviving undetected for months while planning his next move. However, when Jeffrey falls for a divorced mum, his devo his double life starts to unravel, setting off a compelling and suspenseful game of cat and mouse as his past closes in. Okay, so um this film co-stars Kirsten Dunst, uh Peter Dinklage, uh Juno Temple, um, that bloke what was in Atlanta, Lucky Stanfield. Um so pretty great cast and It comes from director Derek Sion France, who um I don't know how what would be the most well known film to people listening to this, probably The Place Beyond the Pines, which was uh Really great film, a Ryan Gosling sort of like crime epic, you know, certainly trying to be a crime epic from about 10 years ago. Um, and this film is definitely a lot lighter than that. It's also a lot lighter than Blue Valentine, um another of um Sion Francis films, which is in the um sad, horny, borderline, traumatic horny mold. Yeah. Um A little bit, yeah. So he's gone from making very heavy stuff to a bit lighter stuff. I didn't see his HBO show actually with two Mark Ruffaloes. Um that was like Matthew. Oh my god. I don't know. I don't know if at the end they team up and fight Bowser or something like that, but uh Mark Ruffalo.

Matthew
15:30
So I thought you said Mark Wahlberg's and that's I was like Yuck, that sounds awful.

Samuel
15:35
No, it's um it's uh this I can't remember the name of the show anyway. Yeah um so this has been a little while since he's made a film, this guy. And yeah, it is kind of like a comedy drama, really, of this guy who is uh basically he is like uh becomes notorious for robbing McDonald's. He breaks in through the roof and robs these places in exactly the same way and leaves the staff in the in the freezer or the fridge area. Um and then t knowing that the cops will turn up. But the the common thread is that people say he's very nice and uh yes, but nonetheless it's America and America's justice system is basically like Fuck you basically about it about pretty much everything. Um so he gets a really um quite a rough uh sentence really considering he doesn't really um harm anyone um physically or anything like that uh i in the process of doing this, but whatever, goes to jail, um, and then breaks out through very elaborate means and yes, hides out in this Toys R Us. And then starts building a second life for himself while he's, you know, using this Toys of R Us as his home base. Um it's set in the mid-nauties. It's like I think specifically set in 2004. And so what is interesting is that to to kind of survive in this Toys of Us, he goes to he he steals like MMs um from the you know from the inside the shop. He has to find a way to at first like break in to the security room and turn off the security recordings. Then he's free to eat as much of a And then um and then to make money while he's um dating Kirsten Dunst, who plays a single mother. Um he trades in video games, Matthew, and there's a lot of Period accurate video games and video game references in this film, which I think makes it quite compelling. So you see him offloading copies of Vice City to like pawn shops and This is the only film, surely, that exists and will ever exist where an actor, you know, paid millions, says the words four swords adventures. That happens in this film. Um Channing Tatum says those words. Um and so that those kind of like period elements are quite fun. And then I think the film leaves you to make a bit of a judgment call about the character because he is a nice guy. Um but he is also sort of like love bombing the Kirsten Dunce character a little bit and He's sort of like he feels like he's overcompensating for the fact that he expects to get caught again at some point. And so he's trying to live, trying to have a relationship on fast forward while pretending to be someone else Um yeah, and so yeah, so it's sort of like everything's on fast forward a little bit for for him, and then I won't really sp I won't spoil where it kind of goes from there. That's really just like the first act of it. But It is like a fun caper film and better than I thought it would be and the best I've seen Channing Tatum in a while a little while. He's quite um quite charming in this. It's a bit closer to his sort of jump street um sort of persona, I would say. Um The only thing you have to get over is that he is c playing a character who is allegedly thirty years old. And no offense, dog, but that is a forty-five-year-old looking man right there. Um Yes, he's got the the best hair that like Hollywood can offer a man. Um but he's definitely not thirty, you know? Like Timothy Chalamet's almost thirty. Like this there's a world of difference between those two guys. But um did you have any interest in this one, Matthew?

Matthew
18:49
I I did. I read some reviews that were a little bit kind of sort of wringing their hands over the sort of conflict between a kind of good guy, fun time film and his like criminal actions in real life. Like the film couldn't quite balance those two things or didn't have like a particularly sort of smart answer about it. I don't know if that's like a a tension you feel in it.

Samuel
19:15
Ugh, not really. It's just uh I don't think it's so seriously presented that it asks you to weigh that up. And I I certainly don't really feel the need to burden the film with that. It's sort of like Yeah, I don't know.

Matthew
19:28
I I guess I could see why people Maybe people read into it too much, like at the real events, and then thought, Oh, this is this is representing it as like larks, even though it's Breaking entering.

Samuel
19:40
Well, uh when I would say that when shit does get serious, it it is presented seriously in the film. Okay. And from reading a little bit about the case, it's actually represented fairly authentically, like the a lot of the Uh pretty pretty much every key event that happens in it, you know, really happened and every key character that exists actually exists. And then there's some interview footage at the end with the the people talking about this guy. Um and so yeah, I I don't know, but I I kind of like that it was it was more larks, you know. I wasn't really desperate for this to take a serious turn. And I don't know, like it at the end of the day, like a few people got hurt, but nothing like that bad happened. I don't know. It's not I think it might just be coming fresh off of another film where they made up a character wholesale. That's uh something like this being relatively close to the truth, but also quite a fun hang, um, sort of balances out, I think, quite well. So yeah, I'm not prepared to put that on this film. It's not like a It's uh I put it gave it three and a half on Lairbox, and I think that's exactly right for it.

Matthew
20:39
It's um yeah, it's not sort of like 2004 period dramas are definitely gonna speak to us

Samuel
20:46
They are, but I would say it gets a couple of things wrong actually. So it's got it's got two 90s music cues. Do you know the song Three by Ultranate, Matthew? Uh Because you're free to do what you want. Oh yeah, of course. So it's like a nineties club and a club classic, but no one was listening to that in 2004. It should have been more like cut my life into pieces since it's my last resource. Like it's sort of you know, that even that's a little bit um more 2001 or two than for buttons.

Matthew
21:20
We're not talking about a guy who bought like 90s music tastes into prison so he's a bit out of date.

Samuel
21:26
I mean there's I guess if there's a possibility of that. Um but yeah, it's uh those things feel a bit like more like Sion Francis drawing from the things he's interested in, the time period he's interested in, and the actual reality of it. You know, whether the the albums you see and and like I say, the video games and the toys, they are a bit more, you know, period accurate. So uh They must have had to have made a Toys R Us for this, right? Yeah, and it looks you know, the part for sure. Like it's I I feel like it's only parts of it they've had to build, but you don't interrogate it that closely, but It's got a tick on my elbows and stuff, I guess they were around then. I don't really remember what the big toys were then, but that sounds about right, doesn't it?

Matthew
22:06
No, uh some freaky YouTube channel is doing like an incredible breakdown of which toys were and weren't period accurate.

Samuel
22:13
I actually think some of the more compelling bits to the film are ha the actual like survival within a point of sale display, which is what he does basically. And just Just sort of the actual practicality of it is there's something quite just fun about about that and just how sort of like shower and then walk around this Toys of R Us and stuff is quite Quite odd and but quite charming.

Matthew
22:34
If you had to live in one store, which store would you live in? Which store do you think you could survive in longest?

Samuel
22:41
I is like being st remaining hidden a consideration. I I th yeah, I think so. I probably have to pick something that's got like a a shed in it or a greenhouse or something then so I can kinda go live a live a function functional life. I just but I'm sorta like, you know, he has access to a toilet in this. That would be my number one thing that I'd worry about. It's like I don't want it to be like One corner of a Wilkinson's that's got a load of turds in it.

Matthew
23:07
Anyway, I wouldn't want it to be that of the small Pret and Bath, because their toilet is always out of order.

Samuel
23:13
The small Pret and Bath

Matthew
23:15
I don't think I've ever tried to use the toilet there to be honest. They've just got a sign that goes that says go and use the Westgate Pub's toilet.

Samuel
23:23
That's so strange. Oh god. Um No, so not that one. Um I I guess like probably be the waitroes, because you could use the library upstairs, couldn't you? And so you've got reading material. And you've got like the the you know, the wonderful food uh offered by um by waitros. So um and they've got a great sushi counter, haven't they? But um with your boots and your opulent salmon.

Matthew
23:47
Exactly, it's perfect for me. What would you pick, Matthew? Uh I'd still make a go of it in the small pret, you know. Make a go of it.

Samuel
23:58
They got a bit of so little real estate to hide in that place. Yeah, I'm not I don't know where you would be stored in that space to be honest. Like there's barely enough room for the staff who work there behind the counter. So I don't know where Matthew Castle is, like under the fridge. Is he are you inside the fridge?

Matthew
24:13
It's gotta be a place with food, cause, you know. Waterstones would be Oh Waterstone's got a cafe actually.

Samuel
24:21
Yeah, it has, yeah. But I think the I think the the the selection of food would drive you a bit nuts after a while. But then I thought that about this. So like a genuine plot point of the film is that he starts getting cavities because he's just eating MMs all day. So that's like I say, it's a fun film, it's worth watching for that reason, really. Yeah, it's a great novel premise for people who enjoy the years the year 2004 and the premise what would happen if you lived in a Toys R Us. This film really delivers on both fronts, so uh yes Um your next film, Matthew, is Ballad of a Small Player, which I'm going to read the synopsis of now. Where is it? There's the bastard. When his past and his debts start to catch up with him, a high-stakes gambler laying low in Macau encounters a kindred spirit who might just hold the key to his salvation. I was curious about this one, Matthew, because it's from Edward Berger who did last year's Conclave, a massive crowd pleaser. Um a very fun film at Bar Film Festival to to watch in a room full of old people. How was this?

Matthew
25:17
Yeah, this was this was okay. It's it caught bit of an acquired taste only, because it's Macau is just like super garish, you know, almost like Las Vegas. you know, but amplified by like a hundred. So it's like a really overwhelming like sensory experience and Berger like puts this really loud, like aggressive uh soundtrack over the top of it. So it's it's like a really like full on. Like you you I think it's trying to sell you on the idea of uh Colin Farrell just having like all his senses burnt out while dealing with like terrible hangovers. Like that's that's like a a big part of this film's energy and You know, in that sense, like what I liked about Conclave was it w it did feel quite immersive in that environment. You know, it really felt kind of close and confined and uh he's I th you know, I he's obviously very good at that. That's s obviously one of Edward Burger's sort of you know, superpowers is his ability to sell you on wouldn't it be awful to be in X place? Um I think where it maybe comes unstuck is like He he's quite a cartoonish character because he he's i he calls himself Lord Doyle and he's got this very ridiculous uh over-the-top like aristocratic English accent. Um, which is very quickly revealed to be like a bit of a ruse. Like he's kind of putting on this persona while he basically goes around driving up huge debts in all these different casinos. Uh and But the cartoonishness of it felt like I could never quite like care enough about it to like feel like truly anxious. It's got a bit of like uh uncut gems flavor to it in the in the way things escalate and he basically keeps like doubling down. He's a gambling addict and he he makes some terrible terrible calls and you know, just when he gets an opportunity to get out, he'll always double down and get in worse and you know it really it builds, you know, builds and builds and builds to quite a quite a great sequence actually where he he places like one extraordinary bet, which uh is almost good enough to make it worth watching. Um but uh there's also a a very strange Tilde Swinton turn, which is like not quite like snow piercer over the top, but is qu is is very silly and and kind of not in keeping with the world and it it it to me it felt like uh you know, a film that was trying to act accurately capture the anxiety of being in a horrible situation of the completely of your own making but trying to do it through these quite s silly over-the-top characters that it didn't quite buy. So it's a a bit of a Bit of a sort of failed experiment, but it was certainly a like sensory overload, which I quite enjoyed.

Samuel
28:10
Yeah, that's um Interesting to hear, because I I had hoped this would be a bit more have a bit of wider appeal after watching Conclave which was had so much appeal. But um yeah, i uh uh dunno, d doesn't sound like it quite hits the spot. Inter Every now now when I hear or Tilda Swinton does something wild in this, I'm like, how What could what could it possibly be next? Like, oh, she's a pterodactyl in this one or something like that.

Matthew
28:42
has kind of a pu almost like a post-credit sequence, which is just like a big Tilda Swinton meme.

Samuel
28:48
Um and boil in a bag meme strikes again.

Matthew
28:51
Yeah, there's a l a lot a lot of memes coming out of this film festival. Um Yeah, I I mean it's gonna be on Netflix, so probably probably worth a watch there. Um just it's yeah a little bit I couldn't quite lock in on the tone of it. Um it's based on a book by someone Osborne. I can't remember his first name. Lawrence Osborne. Lawrence, that's right, yeah. And I've I've read uh one of his other books and I can sort of see how you'd get from his tone to this film. You know, he mate he writes a lot about like expats in China and Hong Kong. And it's, you know, about these quite sort of like diseased, lonely characters having a really fucking horrible time in the sort of dying days of the British Empire. And I can understand why you might read that and think, oh let's let's really go for it, let's really ramp this up and make it like a hugely overwhelming thing. But I I'd I'd think there's probably a bit more subtlety to his writing than than is here.

Samuel
29:51
Okay, interesting. Well I'll check this out anyway, because like I say, it's on Netflix from the twenty-ninth of October. So um, yeah, not far away. But uh yeah, okay. Good stuff Matthew. Well not good stuff, but two and a half star stuff perhaps. I'm uh I'm really interested in this next one. Okay, yeah, is this thing on? Um facing middle age and an impending divorce, Alex finds new purpose in the New York comedy scene. while his wife Tess confronts the sacrifices she made for their family. So this is another it's a bit more of a drama comedy this than a comedy drama, like uh Reefman was. It stars um Will Arnett as Alex Novak I believe this is roughly based on comedian John Bishop's uh life. Um if uh you know if that's if that's true then he he uh basically went to uh you know stand to do stand-up comedy to compensate for his failing marriage and uh yeah impending divorce and this is an uh you know American character, um American version of that story I guess where Pretty quickly, Will Arnett goes from playing, you know, a very sort of like low rent comedy club to being in the cellar, which I think is the most famous comedy club in the world. So That happens very quickly. And um, yeah, I think this this film worked a bit better than I thought it would. I thought it would. It's directed by Bradley Cooper. And I've not seen um uh that f the f the Lady Gargah film. What's that the remake, Matthew? Um Star is born. Yeah, Star is Born, which I I think people say was was pretty good. Yeah. Um I thought Maestro was a bit over the top. Yeah, over not I wasn't massively offended by it, but it was a bit like it was you know the the give me an Oscar of desperation of it. It was it was. He was really going for it. Um and this is a bit of a this feels a little bit of a palette cleanser after that, I guess, because even though it's releasing an award season It's not really uh I don't think it's it's not gonna w win any awards, I don't think. At most I think you might get see Laura Dern, who plays Will Arnett's uh wife in it, getting a a a supporting actress nomination because people really like Laura Dern. Um but I don't think that there's a Will Arnett best actor, you know, nomination that in the offing or anything like that. It's it's a bit of a you know, it's a just a bit of a character piece that uses the stand-up comedy scene as a bit of like uh as a bit of fun colour and something for him something for him to focus his energies on as his marriage just You know, he just cannot fix his marriage and it gets a little bit out of his hands. But then um the film is quite sympathetic towards both parties. It's it it manages to balance that quite well. And uh I don't know, I I guess maybe it's 'cause Bradley Keopers dated a series of supermodels. He's got a lot of experience of navigating. breakups of people, um you know, but in his case, extremely attractive people, um, or whatever. But um maybe there's a bit of his own reality being put in there. I would say I I share a similar gripe to Reefman though that Will Arnett is a is ten years too old to play this character. And like I it feels like a very forties coded story to me. Yeah, yeah. So they're both they're they're both too old for it, I think. Like they this should have been actors in the this should have been like a Channing Tatum, you know, sort of age role. It's kind of perfect for that. But you know, these are they're pr they're pretty close to being my parents' generation of these two, and it's just not it's not quite right. kids who are like eight and ten or whatever. It doesn't quite add up. So yeah, that that part bothered me a bit. It's a bit of like Hollywood sort of like, you know uh a sort of age warping at work there. But the actual stand-up comedy stuff is surprisingly good in this.

Matthew
33:31
Oh, that's what I was gonna ask about, because normally when films are about comedy shows or stand-up comedians or any kind of like comedy as it is on TV. That stuff always just bombs so hard that I think, even when they're played by stand-up comedians, I think Oh man, what happened? Like is this just not something you can capture on film and it works?

Samuel
33:52
Yeah, I I think it works pretty well here. It's I think it helps that Will Arnett knows how to do this. Um you know he's and it sort of like builds up to it. Like he he sort of chances his way through it at first because he talks about his marriage and he gets a few laughs and it's just enough to power him through. But then other comedians will like comment on his technique a a little bit and um how it's not very good and then y you see him like practicing his material and doing the same you know, bits over and over again. Um and it's I think it I think that part is actually all pretty authentic. And maybe that suggests that Bradley Cooper's a bit of a stand up dork. Maybe there's a bit of that to it. Right. Um it's not amazing. It's It's got one w uh w I don't won't spoil it, but there's one use of stand-up that's like such a dramatic flourish that no way would have happened in John Bishop's life, but is a classic bit of a m Hollywood bullshit movie making um where he goes on stage and is really emotional.

Matthew
34:49
It's just very like ugh I I hated that screen because I thought I mean something in that book that they read and thought Oh well enough of this makes sense as a movie that we can copy it, right? Yeah, I guess so.

Samuel
35:02
Um is John Bishop like good?

Matthew
35:05
Is it worth making a film about his stuff? I think it was like super popular for a for a while. Like I think he kinda came on and exploded in his like he felt like he was almost Michael McIntyre big, but just sort of chose to take his career in a s in a slightly different direction. But I do think he was a bit of a yeah, sort of late bloomer who, you know, had a had a kind of reasonably big impact. Um kind of it kind of bums me out a little bit. Well not not not in a serious way I guess, but You know that this you know just takes the sort of emotional shape of it rather than, you know, because everyone was like, what Will Arnett's gonna be playing John Bishop? That's crazy. And then they're like, oh no, he's this other fictional character, and you're like, Oh, okay. But I did wonder if like enough of his original story would remain that you'd be able to sort of recognize like, oh, that character's like a proxy for Johnny Vegas or something.

Samuel
36:01
Like that you could see the skeleton of the British comedy scene underneath this American drama, but it does not sound like that is the case Not even remotely. It's so American. It's just down to the fact that like that Will Arnett's character's called Alex Novak. And you're like, uh that's just it's a very blair. has a has a problem with, you know, American media generally and like um the American perspective on things. But there is something about taking John Bishop, that bloke off the telly, and saying he's Alex Novak now. Played by Will Arnett, who I, you know, is trying to make Jason Bateman hair happen, which is should be illegal, frankly. Just like he's got this like long hair in him, and I don't think so. Well on it. Like we all saw your hairline in Arrested Development 20 years ago. Like I was I was offended by that, frankly. Um and so I don't yeah, but I don't know how much of the divorce part is true, but that is again handed handled quite tenderly. It's nothing revolutionary in the portrayal of it or or really that challenging. But it's um it's alright. It's yeah, I only asked that question on John Bishop because I feel like in the UK there are two tracks of comedians. So it's the ones who get to go on BBC One And are quite PG and inoffensive and not really that good. And then there's like And then there's Frankie Boyle, for example, who's like, you know, generationally brilliant and but actually like too spicy to really go To be allowed to be on too. Too spicy for the BBC sounds like a terrible stand-up tour, doesn't it? Too spicy for the BBC. Do you know what I mean? That every now and then I'm like, oh yeah, British comedy scene, you know, whatever, and then I'd r and I'll see like a bit of Frankie Bohr stand-up and he'll be like, Oh no, we got some amazing stand-up comedians here. It's just that The way it's sort of stacked is a bit like who's the one who can get onto a panel show kind of thing, you know? So it's uh that's the only reason I ask. And I also got John Bishop slightly mixed up with Mickey Flanagan, who also has long hair and was famous around the same time. But they're not the same guy. Matthew remotely. Fire again hosted the Games Media Awards one year. I remember I was at that one. Um he did a pretty good job. Anyway, so yeah that's it is this thing on. Do you think you'll see this one?

Matthew
38:08
Uh, I think I probably will yeah, I'm just c I'm curious about it, you know. I'm curious about the directorial arc of Bradley Cooper. I really liked Star is Born, I thought that was, you know, pretty great actually. But I absolutely hated Maestro, but this feels so small scale and unimportant compared to Maestro. I'm just kind of curious about why that's happened.

Samuel
38:29
I don't think you should have released it in awards season, because I think that suggests it's something it's not. I think it would have been a great like Valentine's Day kind of window movie. You know, something that's a bit like that would get people in their you know, like get our parents to go to the cinema or something. It's got a bit of I don't know, like the the the roses, whatever they were going for. Like that it feels like that the audience who'd watch that should probably watch this, you know? So Yeah. Um your next movie, Matthew, is Tuna, which I'm very curious about.

Matthew
38:59
Yeah. So this was the mystery screening at the London Film Festival, so you turn up without knowing what it is. Uh and I felt like when they said it was tuna I'd never even heard of it. So it wasn't like you could have any kind of reaction in the room. Like I didn't feel there was like a oh or like a hooray. Everyone was like, what the hell is this? Um what this is is a quite small scale New York set thriller about a Uh trainee piano tuner uh who works who's played by oh Jesus what's his name He was in the s season two of the White Lotus. He's the Leo Woodleo. Yeah, that's it, Leo Whittle. Thank you. Um yeah, he works for Dustin Hoffman, who's this, you know, quite sort of genial uh old old timey piano tuner. Um Leo Woodall in the film has a a a hearing condition where he's he's got like a hypersensitive hearing so he's to sort of like mute out most of the world but it also gives him this incredible ear for tuning these pianos. And uh uh he at one point he uh I can't remember exactly how it comes about, but he he basically realizes that uh his amazing hearing uh and his like you know very sort of like delicate touch that he has um would make him quite a good safe cracker and he starts applying that to uh helping a security firm open broken safes and it escalates into quite a low-key crime thriller but I I a bit sort of about how I felt about this, because in the moment I was like, oh, this is just absolutely brilliant. I thought this was this was really exciting. And then I came out and I read a load of feedback to this and I feel like people thought it was a little bit throwaway or a little bit disappointing. And I don't know if that's just 'cause of the whole secret screening thing and that they were expecting something like a bit more better known and and so they were kind of um throwing their toys at the pram, but I think I've s I've settled on it being like a really entertaining four-star thriller that's super tight, super focused, really good performances all round. a really nice romance that develops between Leo Woodle and this um this piano player uh whose piano he goes to tra uh to tune and you know he doesn't want to kind of like pull her into his his sort of criminal hijinks, but there's this constant threat of that in the background. It's maybe a little bit neatly plotted in the way certain things come back round to like bite him on the arse. But it's um it it really explores the idea completely and gets quite a lot of like ex you know big cinematic thrills out of it, you know, some quite exciting sequences of like lock you know, safe cracking and Um just the audio mix on the film is is you know is really nice. The guy directed it had made documentaries previous to this, um and it's got this very kind of like handheld, kind of like montage feel. um, you know, it feels quite s New Yorky to me and sort of well placed. I think the thing I'd maybe liken it to the most, as a sales pitch to people who are you know, on the fence about this one, is it kind of reminded me of it kind of reminded me of whiplash in the sense of this is just like one idea really, really well explored and seen like through from beginning to end in a really entertaining fashion. Like it's just just a really tight bit of entertainment. Um, you know, if not going to change the world.

Samuel
42:44
That's interesting. I didn't really 'cause I I I knew this film existed before the secret screening and I was a little bit jealous he got to see it 'cause I thought it sounded l I think it's a great premise for a third.

Matthew
42:55
Yeah.

Samuel
42:56
Um and I'm not I'm personally not averse to the idea of watching a Dustin Hoffman in a new movie, which might be another point of tension on how you feel about him as an actor um because of, you know, um all the Me Too stuff. I can't say In his case, I don't know, it's sort of a bit uh for whatever reason it's a slightly different case to maybe some someone like Kevin Spacey. Oh yeah, I don't I think so. He's a bit more of a side character in it as well. Yeah, so that's um that is interesting. I'm not really sure uh it's sort of that Leo Woodell guy I thought was alright in the White Lotus. I think some people maybe got a bit too excited about him in the White Lotus and were like, you know, he's like the guy. And I was a bit like, well, he was I thought it was all right, but that was a pretty amazing cast in that in that season.

Matthew
43:39
Yeah he's just sort of like soft and nice and fragile. I think the fact that I think him and and the girl he meets have really good chemistry. Like you know, the exciting bits are exciting, the romantic bits are romantic, the funny bits are quite funny, you know, it's it's not doing anything like absolutely you know, mould breaking, but it it all just works.

Samuel
44:01
Yeah. Okay, cool. Well I'm up for this. This sounds um I think it it sounds great. I mean I I assume it's gonna get a release date at some point in the UK, but it's um

Matthew
44:10
Yeah, but I I can't I don't know if this is gonna be like is this gonna be an audience or is this gonna be an art house cinemas? I can't it i it it's almost too small scale, you know? It's it's not like I don't know, I'm trying to think of a similar thing. Oh, what was that ghastly Daran Oronovsky thing this summer? Oh, caught stealing.

Samuel
44:28
Yeah, this is like a much better budget version of that Yeah, I was gonna say that it and Ruth Band sound similar in that respect, where I felt like this is well worth watching and it's very well made and it's um a fun hang, but it's not anything hugely consequential. You know, it just happens to be at a film festival. So it maybe gets a bit more scrutiny than he otherwise might do. So uh yeah that sounds good. Yeah I liked it. Yeah Yes, it's from a documentarian, right? Uh Daniel Roa who made Navalny. Um did you already say that and I missed it.

Matthew
44:57
I think a lot of these films, um particularly some of the ones to come Th were films that I might not ever really want to see again, even if I admire them. Where this one I'm like, I could quite happily watch this one again.

Samuel
45:09
Nice. Alright, well um that's definitely still um high on my uh to watch list. So that's tuna. That's tuna. Um T-U-N-E-R, in case you get an A at the end there. Um it's not about a man who uses who cra cracks tins of tuna. No, but they talk about tuna the fish a lot. Okay, that's good to know. Um another reason to to watch this film, Matthew. Okay, Springsteen, Deliver Me From Nowhere. I did dial up a synopsis here, but it's about the making of the album Nebraska, the Bruce Springsteen album. Bruce Springsteen is played by Jeremy Allen White from The Bear um with contact lenses in and um his manager who is a former music journalist I believe is played by Jeremy Strong um once again doing his sort of hang dog face but being a bit of a bit less curse than he was in The Apprentice, um the Donald Trump film. Uh so yeah, it's um it's a music biopic. But actually surprisingly short on the, you know, sort of like actor becoming the musician and doing like a big Bit you know, doing a a bunch of tracks that you like, that crowd pleasing thing. And it's much more about being depressed while making this album that at the time was not a commercial Smash hit, but was just as he was on the precipice of becoming a huge star. Springsteen not someone I have a huge relationship with is music, Matthew, I'm sure you're the same. Um and I think in general he's a bit more of a US institution than he is in, you know.

Matthew
46:33
uh around the world, like he's just so blue collar US in that specific way.

Samuel
46:38
Weirdly one of Catherine's brothers is like a super fan.

Matthew
46:41
So That's not that surprising to me. I've heard I've heard like a moderate amount just you know at their house and and through him.

Samuel
46:49
Yeah, I think I think certainly that a lot of his more, you know, sort of uh stadium filler anthems are pretty well known here. You know, get Like there's maybe five to six songs everyone knows by Bruce Springsteen. He's that he's that level of musician for sure, but I feel like the minutiae of knowing what Nebraska is. I don't think my dad would know what Nebraska is as an album, versus his other albums, for example. It's sort of like You know, he is still very much an American um concern. Um people might disagree with that. But anyway, so yeah, this has got a bit of a mixed reception from people. I think it's just alright, this film. Um I th some people seemed really offended by it, which I found a bit strange, because I just don't think that music biopics can be that offensive. It focuses a lot on Uh the relationship between Springsteen and his father, who is played by um Stephen Graham, um playing, in my opinion, um a villain from the Batman Arkham series, a low-level Batman villain, sort of like your Victor Zaz level Batman face. Especially when he's got like prosthetic old man face. Yeah, he's got big it's the bat energy, um I would say, in the way he does his American accent in this. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
47:54
I I c I quite like this I think compared to some of the drubbings that I've read and some of the more kind of sneering takes. I think it is it is like Ah well it isn't it isn't a traditional biopic in that there there is some like how did this album get made and here are some very specific details of like how did they get this particular sound? Or he had this he had this piece of equipment brought into his, you know, house and and all this. But it's also quite a small window of time. And a lot of it's just him like mooching around being sort of sad. So it's not like you know, it doesn't cover like the rise and fall. You know, it isn't like an Elvis, for example. Um and at that smaller frame of time I thought was qu quite interesting, just felt like, oh, we've got something we want to say about this particular window. Uh I don't know enough about him that, you know, th the story beats of this, you know, if not like amazingly surprising. Um, yeah, I was still interested. Oh, I didn't know that he made this album and that they wanted to make like a bigger album, but they sort of you know, that's that's really the conflict at the heart of the film. Like is he gonna be asked to make a a much bigger kind of crowd pleasing album or does he get to make this this more kind of sensitive work? Um the only bit of this that didn't quite work for me is like it sort of sells you on the idea that there's gonna be some like great trauma or great problem at the heart of this character. And I was like, oh okay, well I don't know much about Springsteen, so I don't know if he does have anything in his life and, you know, I dun i I i I don't it's a mild spoiler like I felt was like quite common to a lot of people and the solution in the film was quite the obvious solution. Uh it's hard to sort of s talk about it without sort of s sort of spoiling it, but i i it was a bit of a shrug at the end where they were like, Oh, well we've got a so you know, we can get on top of this. Um and then it's like, and he did. And the end. And yeah. I was like, oh, oh okay, well good for him I guess. Um I it's not like uh uh you know oh there was this one major hurdle he had to get over. Like even the stuff with his dad was like pretty soft. Um and I just felt I just felt like the it was quite low stakes as far as traumas go, but maybe that's like brutally unfair to say and you know me speaking from a you know a place of good mental health shouldn't say things like that I don't know but I was a little bit like Oh yeah, I mean everyone gets a bit down. And it's good to talk to someone about it. I mean that's that that's how this works for everyone I think.

Samuel
50:38
Yeah, I you know what it sort of I actually I thought it was not a million miles away from the Dylan biopic a complete and unknown in that respect. Because that's a film that doesn't really have stakes in it. It's just that, oh, he went from, you know, a a sort of like uh went f to uh to electro and shocked all these people who like folk music. I mean uh in a sixty years ago and you're like oh wow I mean I mean not mind blowing stakes either, but people seem to really like that film and I think that's just because that film is much more of a crowd pleaser and giving you loads and loads of music numbers so you're you're not really sat there thinking oh what what's the that's the plot of this film is too loose. There's no there's no drama around the Dylan character, which is people are obsessed with that for this film. But I don't think that I don't think that film had, you know, much more to say than this does. In fact, if anything, like less than this does. It you know, that that didn't really have any themes at all, I don't think. It's just that it was great to hear Chalamet and Monica Barbaro sing, you know, sing these familiar songs. Or one of the fannings looks sad. Yeah, exa exactly. And that's as dramatic as it ever got. But that peo that feel people falling over themselves to that film. And they're d they're turbo-dunking on this film. I'm say there's like half a star apart for those films. Okay. So that's what That's what annoyed me about it was like the people were so offended by this, but the Dylan film was like such a gentle ride and people were like, oh, isn't that nice? The same critics, and that's what annoyed me about it.

Matthew
52:08
They're the same. I think the bits of the review which you know the negative reviews that I I was sort of a bit head scratching over was um He has a like relationship with a waitress in this film, which apparently is completely fictionalized. But I hadn't I had no idea, you know. And I don't does it matter? You know, like M most films are completely fictionalized. And I know I don't think this is claiming like that's like a like a kind of a key truth of his life or anything. And I quite liked the relationship, I quite liked the actress they had playing her uh, you know, it wasn't anything, you know, st stellar again. It was s it was sa you know, it was it was absolutely solid, but then I saw these reviews sort of scoffing, using their real world knowledge of it to sort of knock it down. It's like, well I don't think you know, most people wouldn't know. Like I just assumed, oh yeah, that's something that happened and even if it didn't, I mean it it works emotionally in the film. Uh I'd uh it's it's a weird a weird kind of criticism, you know, like Frodo didn't fucking climb up a real mountain, that didn't happen. But we still kind of ball our eyes out over it.

Samuel
53:15
I stopped listening I stopped listening to the big picture over this film. I thought the I thought their episode on it was terrible. And like it was like the w it's the most I've ever n like had to turn that off that podcast because I just thought they're j it's all it is is just dunks and people showing you how much they know about music. And I was just like, whatever man. I just I honestly I just thought It's not and while they'll praise like any old nonsense, but if as long as it's on their corner. It's the only time a podcast has ever annoyed me that much that I've had to stop listening to it. Straight away and just be like, no, I'm opting out. I'm opting out now. It's uh thing is it's not a great movie. It's it's just an okay movie. But I would say that Th it's pretty much in line with most where most music biopics have been in the last few years. It's sort of like it's never really a revolutionary genre unless someone does something like quite quite radical with it, like kneecap, for example. You know what I mean? So Yeah, I don't know. Umplexed by the reaction to this one. It's just it's like a three-star film, and that's that's f that's all it is really. But um Yeah, okay. Moving on then, Matthew. Um, I will read the synopsis for this one because um I I watched this one at the end, the third film. Uh three days and my arse was an absolute state after um after sitting on those seating in the Royal Festival Hall at LFF. Um after years of unemployment, a man creates a unique and dark plan to secure a job, eliminating his competition. And uh Is that true base I mean Years Uh I I guess like it's at least months, right? It's sometimes maybe some AI came up with this, but um in any case it's uh it's about the downsizing of the paper industry. And these this American company uh well basically this guy from America telling them they had no other choice but to close this factory. And this is happening across, you know, across the country. And they are and the amount of jobs that are around are just disappearing. And this dude's too old to go do anything else. But he's got this fucking amazing house that his family lives in. And he'll do anything to hold on to it. This is a part of Chan Wuk's new film. Matthew, this is your your corner. So why don't you pick up from here?

Matthew
55:27
Yeah, so it's part Chan Wuk uh working with Lee Byeung-Hun, who you might know as the uh the masked man who runs Squid Games and also loads of amazing Korean films. I'd say this is this is like very Parasite adjacent in that it's a big social satire about downsizing. If you sort of imagined Parasites sort of flipped from the other direction. So instead of about like a poor family striving to be rich, it's about a relatively well-off guy striving to stay well-off even though he's been made redundant. and the extreme lengths he goes to, which, you know, a I would say is immediately apparent if you've watched the trailer, uh, involves g uh uh uh going after and killing some other people, some other kind of competition. It's quite a literal like dog eat dog sort of recruitment satire, I guess is is the broad shape of it. I'd say in a slightly more hyper comic register than Parasite. Like it's it's got thriller sequences that really work where you're like, what the hell's gonna happen here? But it's It's largely about the comically extreme lengths this guy goes to because you know, th at the very like being of his character is is is being employed for a long time. You know, he has a really good life and he seems very good at his job and it's this the idea that when you take that away from someone, you know, how qu how mm madly they go to pieces. Um but he's also in a world surrounded with other quite over the top characters. His family are relatively grounded, I say. Like they're you know, he's trying to kind of protect them from the the kind of dire financial reality that he faces. But like the other the other kind of um paper men h you know, who he's going after are all quite interesting characters in themselves, some of them quite silly. I really like this. I th I th I thought this was you know, as you would expect from Par Chan work he made Old Boy and the Handmaiden and um uh dil um oh what's the last one you did? Deliver not deliver me from evil, no decision to leave Yeah, that's it. Uh you know, he has made some of the greatest films of all time. I don't think this one is like top tier for him. I think it's like almost slightly too manic and too s too silly to have like the real like emotional weight of his like very best films but it is so impeccably made, so beautifully shot, conceived, like the settings, the house that he lives in is absolutely amazing. Like the character acts he wor acts uh character actors he works with. you know, just fill the screen with these really interesting faces and personalities. Like there isn't a boring minute in this film. I I just think that maybe when you put it against Mm, less so old boy. I'd say uh Handmaid is uh Handmaiden is is one of his like you know one of his all-time best films. I it it didn't quite get to the same place for me. Um But I d I r I really enjoyed it. It's really entertaining. It's a great satire on well, on on on the you know, just what our, you know, wider sort of work structure, you know, does to everyone's morals and just how instantly people can fall to pieces and is quite accurate I think on you know, what happens when work is like, you know, a cornerstone of your personality. Um you know, I f I felt some of that for sure.

Samuel
59:17
Yeah, I think that if you work in any creative industry that the themes of the film will speak to you. I think I think you're right that the manic energy of it means that it sort of like can't quite hit you emotionally in the way that You know, some of his films do, and I think Decision to Leave definitely did. Um there's like an emotional dimension to that that I don't think this quite has because The sort of like dark comedy aspect of it overpowers the film. Um, I think I re I mean I really like this. I wonder if I like this slightly more than you. Um I did go from waiver between a four and a four and a half in this one. Um because I I'd seen it at the end of the a day and it was very, very hot in the cinema, and I was like and I was quite tired and I was like I don't know if these are the best circumstances with which to to see this film. Um, but I do think that it's like incredibly made in a bunch of ways. Like there's Loads and loads of like shot matching in this. Like the the way that one scene will transition into another and a specific shot will like match up with another and the way it's edited and like colour corrected and like it looks you know absolutely gorgeous and it's it's like In some ways, I think that's where he shows off the most, like what he can do as a filmmaker, where where it's like most of what you're seeing is happening in like um you know, i in and around this like amazing house where they live. or like at the you know the sort of houses or sort of like small workplaces where these like other guys are are working and they're not you know, great uh there's nothing like extraordinary about them in terms of location, but it's the the the way that it's filmed is uh absolutely breathtaking and worth watching for that alone, I think. So Yeah.

Matthew
01:00:58
He's almost like Car Chemwick is almost like his quality just hasn't wavered at all. Like he's a similar sort of stylist and perfectionist as like David Fentcher, but David Fentcher's films have been like way more all over the place as of late than his. You know, it's like if you know, he he is still absolutely I well if anything he's getting better part channw I think as he goes on. You know, like his shot composition and like the locations they film and it just looks It it's unreal in places. Like there's frames of this you could like hang on your wall. Um there's a sequence I won't say what happens in it, but there's a sequence Where people are drowned out by like a pop song and it's just so chaotic. But I've also never really seen of a a scene like it with this particular sound mix they have of like this song cranked up so loud that you can't really hear the people in the room. Um uh uh yeah, i i f so many surprises. Um like it is it is absolutely brilliant as a as a piece of filmmaking. Um, I th I think my ma my biggest problem with it is I feel the main character goes to pieces a little bit too fast.

Samuel
01:02:11
Yeah, I that's that was my main problem with the film is that you have to really like break uh your perception of this per being a real person with this film because I don't think a normal person would make the choices that he does, you know?

Matthew
01:02:27
Well yeah, because it sets it up of oh a great injustice has been done to him. Like he's clearly amazing at his job but then he becomes a almost an i complete idiot in his pursuit of this. I mean maybe it's that Cohen Brothers thing of, you know, there are just people who are kinda like made for violence and people who aren't and w you know, when when people try and commit violent acts, when they don't, it all goes horribly wrong. And but he seemed like quite a goon at times. And I was like, oh, I think this works better if he's like Which i is like well meaning and it i it makes the sting of his redundancy feel a bit stronger.

Samuel
01:03:02
Yeah, I it's sort of like Uh again, it's uh it's where it it's darkly comic where it perhaps could have just been a bit more straightforwardly dark, but still satirical. Yeah. I I sort of I think it does take some it does ring some like good comedy out of doing that, I would say. Like there's some there's some great physical comedy in this for sure. But um I think does it maybe separ you know, does it maybe mean it's it doesn't quite reach that next level of like Emotional residence. So that's probably the case. Um I don't know. But that's but that's okay. I think it's still Really entertaining and a stressful watch, you know?

Matthew
01:03:41
I I just think he's a director you hold to like the absolute highest standard. And, you know, it's the difference between oh he's made another five star masterpiece and oh he's just made like one of the best films I've seen this year. You know?

Samuel
01:03:54
And there is a distinction there, but it's maybe unfair, but I I think it's true. Yeah, it's interesting 'cause I think I think the a narrative around it was that this was gonna be the big year for him and you know, like at last basically. But I actually think decision to leave would have been a better f choice for that kind of that that sort of narrative.

Matthew
01:04:13
I th I thought that was yes, slightly better than this. This this is the Well I say what, the the the end credits shot of this film I found so overwhelmingly bleak, despite being quite abstract and not really what how you'd expect what you'd expect to see of this, but like Almost like Oppenheimer levels of bleak when I came out of this feeling just so depressed about where everything was going.

Samuel
01:04:39
Yeah, uh for sure. It's I'd I'd definitely say that the the satirical element of it uh it's so universal. And I think that's where the parasite comparison really makes sense. You know, it's like They are both saying different things about how fucked we are. Um, but it you know, but things that like definitely have have something in common. Um also like there's some really e esoteric, like eclectic music choices in this as well. Yeah. It's classical music and sort of like pop and I honestly it's it really like surprising on that front as well. I I really liked it. It's just not quite as good as maybe it you know you perhaps might imagine in your mind's eye Matthew Okay, so um next film, Matthew, is one of yours.

Matthew
01:05:21
Uh this is A Pale View of Hills, which is an adaptation of uh early, maybe the earliest uh Kazu Ishigiru novels. um who is a uh uh Japanese born writer who who came over to the UK in his childhood, and uh certainly this novel concerns that in that it's about a uh a sort of second generation Japanese family living in the UK in the eighties and the daughter of the family is sort of investigating her mother's past and then you get some flashbacks to sort of her in Japan as a younger woman and how she came to leave there. Um I won't dwell on this one too much. I thought I thought this was a bit of a duffer. Um you know, quite well meaning. It's got some act actors I really like in it. The the younger Japanese character in the Japanese sections um is played by uh she was

Samuel
01:06:20
I I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but Suzu Hirose.

Matthew
01:06:23
Maybe she was our little sister in Koriadas, our little sister. Um and she was so delightful in that and it was just nice to see her in a film again. I was like, oh, she's just Just a really nice presence and there are a few little characters and some odd little subplots in this that worked, particularly in the Japanese sections. I I just I found the England portions of this j they just they they sounded really false to me. Like it was a Japanese director, largely Japanese cast, and I don't know if it's just like a language barrier thing or not having like lived in the UK but uh you know the where where the the historic Japanese sections felt really authentic Uh I I thought the the framing mo moments in modern day were quite phony. Uh just didn't land for me at all. Um yeah, it was a bit it was a bit of a bummer. Um But uh you know you know, I felt bad as well because Catherine couldn't make this one because uh we had a gas leak, so she have she missed our second day of um London Film Festival. She let me go kindly 'cause she knew how much I wanted to see the Park Chan Wuk film.

Samuel
01:07:35
What angel. Catherine's such an angel.

Matthew
01:07:37
She is, she's the best. So I took my I actually took my dad to see Springsteen and the um Park Chan Wuk film. Oh right, that's cool. Yeah, it was quite nice. It was quite down on the Springsteen one. Ungrateful father.

Samuel
01:07:51
That's funny. I mean This uh has got mixed reviews.

Matthew
01:07:54
Um I just think if you watch that Springsteen film and his relationship with his dad, I don't think the lesson you should take away from it is like be ungrateful towards my son. I was like, did you learn nothing from Stephen Graham and Springsteen?

Samuel
01:08:08
Come on, man. And that but at the end he said, Sit on my lap, son, and you're like, I can't dad I'm 40 dads afterwards about how that would be strange and how I would never ever want to do that.

Matthew
01:08:32
You know, he was very impressed with Jeremy Allen White's you know, like he said I really look like it. He said the hairs went up on my arm like I really sort s you know, they really captured the energy of that that particular moment, but I thought he was a little bit down on the whole thing otherwise.

Samuel
01:08:46
Okay, well fair enough. There you go, a bonus dad review. I appreciate that. Yeah, an a an additional uh member of Matthew's family is swayed in. I mean, it makes you wonder why they didn't I mean I think there's like a couple of English producers on a pale view of hills, but maybe you should just get like a English co-director to help with those bits. Or maybe like Ishiguro himself should be a bit more Oh he's a producer on the film actually.

Matthew
01:09:12
He wasn't involved. He came up on stage afterwards and then nearly fell down some stairs which was quite exciting.

Samuel
01:09:17
Oh no. It's a legend legendary author. Like that's uh that's terrible. Um okay, well uh i if slightly amusing. Okay, well this the the this seems like it's been largely ignored in awards season which would probably say a lot about how people feel about it Matthew.

Matthew
01:09:31
So that's uh Yeah no, it it it hasn't got the stuff I don't think.

Samuel
01:09:34
Yeah okay. So um we move on to a film that we've both seen there Matthew. Um Rental Family. This is the first film at Bar Film Festival Um Bar Film Festival, by the way, uh I sat at the s in the same seats at every one of these things, and at every one of these things. Uh someone brush had to walk past me to collect her microphone and then like I saw you for sitting in that seat. No, I I say Stop giving intros to the films because they never said anything of note in the intros. I mean they didn't though, did they?

Matthew
01:10:04
They just went, Oh, so it's really good this one. I was I was always in the same seat, which was across the aisle and four rows back from you, so I could see you bristling.

Samuel
01:10:13
Well, it's just that like they never said anything well, I don't know about you. Did you have the same girl who did Die My Love Today where And I was like, well you didn't choose it, did you? It's like one of it's got Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattons in it. You didn't curate this film like this Uh this is one of the films that's coming out. It's by why don't you say something about Lynn Ramsey? Like that's a a pretty, you know, well-regarded director. They never said anything of note about the films. They just said Oh, it's really good this one. And that's basically thank you to our sponsors, and that's it. And it's like, you know, why bother? Was it worth getting me to stand up and brush past me? Just for that, Matthew, what are your thoughts on that?

Matthew
01:10:54
I love that this was sort of going through your head. You are psychologically richer than some of the characters in these films.

Samuel
01:10:59
Uh, I guess so Um I do have big no other choice energy these days, unfortunately. Um okay, synopsis struggling to find purpose, an American actor lands an unusual gig with a Japanese agency to play standing roles for strangers. As he immerses himself in his clients' worlds, he begins to form genuine bonds that blur the lines between performance and reality. Confronting the moral complexities of his work, he soon rediscovers purpose, belonging And the quiet beauty of human connection. This film stars Brendan Fraser and then a few Japanese actors I think you'll know by by face. They include. um Takahiro Hira and uh Mari Yamamoto and yeah it's about this guy who this actor who basically finds more permanent work sort of slotting into people's lives including the life of this um this little girl who's who's never met her father um but the but the the mother of the girl needs a father there to get her into a certain school. And he becomes immersed in their lives and yeah, there's a little bit of a you know a push and pull between how much of this is simulation and how much of this should Brendan Fraser get sort of investing in it. And I thought it's a very nice film, Matthew, and I thought it's a much better use of Brendan Fraser than the Whale was, um, which was hokey award season nonsense. Um, if I have a problem with Aronofsky, I just don't think he gives a shit about the stories he tells or the characters he puts in his films. I think it's all just him trying to show how smart he is as a filmmaker. Um whereas Brenda Fraser gets to be, you know, quite tender in this film. I think it probably speaks to the the truth of who of who he is and Certainly like what his public persona is these days. Um but also he's a giant man who has to like fit into lots of small places in Japan. And I think that's why it spoke to you, Matthew.

Matthew
01:12:43
Yeah, that's that's my favourite thing about this. Shots of him squeezing into like subway cars, sitting awkwardly under those little tables. Um Jo I just anyway he really he really stood out and the fact that they filmed it in Tokyo looks great. It's always exciting when you know they actually film on location and sort of seeing in there. Um Yeah, I I I really like this. I thought it was it was just such a crowd pleaser. It's a little bit schmaltzy and a little bit obvious in places, but Uh, you know, so many of these films were mega grim at the film festival and about people having like the worst time of their lives. Yeah. Like it was actually quite refreshing to watch quite a well made drama about someone having like a wholly good experience uh and with people who you wanted to to to be okay in the end and and mostly were. Um kinda funny in places, but not like cheap I don't think it was like cheap sort of, you know, American abroad stuff either. No. Like there's a natural comedy in how big he is, but Really that's it, you know. There's not like a oh how odd, how queer that they do it like this, you know. None of that. Um you know, bar the central rental family concept, which apparently is a real thing. Um like the idea of hiring actors to be mourners at a funeral or to pose as your mistress to apologize to your wife, you know, these are these are things that happen and uh it's yeah quite uh quite a strange subculture but I you know I th I found that quite interesting as well as entertaining

Samuel
01:14:22
Yeah, definitely. It's sort of I I think that, like you say, looks it looks amazing. It feels very you just feel like you're you're in all the places that Brendan Fraser is. He has like very outsider touristy energy. Even though he lives there, it's sort of like and he's lived there for a long time. He hasn't really like assimilated. You know, he's quite quite a lonely character at the start of the film. And so the idea of him getting the this greater purpose I think is you know, I think that's like a number one challenge for any expat, isn't it? Is just feeling like you're you're part of the world around you and not just like a stranger in a strange land. And yeah, um the ways in which he discovers connection in this. Just yeah, it's just nice, nice film. And uh yeah, um It's it's it's like not overly dramatic. It's uh yeah, but well worth watching though, I think. It's again another one where it's a bit like, should this be an award season film? But like you say, it's counter-programming to everything else, maybe it balances out. So Yeah. Yeah, I can't work out.

Matthew
01:15:20
Do you think this will be in Odeans? Do you think this is mainstream enough? Or is just the nature of it so much of it is in like Japanese that it's gonna be you know, limited to the art house cinemas.

Samuel
01:15:30
I hope so. If people will go see fucking Chainsaw Man, sure they'll go see fucking Rental Family. Do you know what I mean? Like it's Yeah.

Matthew
01:15:36
I would hope I thought it was broad and entertaining enough. You know, like it's it's not quite this, but you know, like we You know, like an old s you know, like a nineties comedy, you know, h sort of high concept comedy of like, this guy has to pose as all these things. You know, it's a bit more subtle and subdued than that. I'm not saying it's like a This would have been like a Jim Carrey vehicle in the nineties. But there is I don't know, there's you know, if it does go in the Odiens, it's it's it's that rare example of like quite a quite a you know, biggish comedy film, which is, you know, rarity these days.

Samuel
01:16:09
Yeah. Uh yeah, that's um yeah, it does it there's not that much in this vein, but I think that It has the potential to cross over, but whether it'll get the chance or not, I'm not I'm not totally sure. More likely to destined to be something that in two years is a like number eight in the Netflix charts because people giving it going, Oh, it's quite a nice film. And maybe like The Sun has written a piece about how it's this nice film you should check out. The Sun's a bad choice actually, The Guardian That's a better choice. Um that you know, would have written something about it or whatever. But yeah, I don't know. It's hard to tell, but it it should do. It should be a thing that You know, yeah, like in the nineties or noughties, you could imagine being like number one at the box office or something with the right star. Brendan Fraser may be not quite famous enough to get this to that point, you know? It's Maybe just a little a rung under where it the kind of actor who would get people to watch it, you know? Um I guess it's a tiny bit lost in translation, adjacent. It is, yeah. And that was, you know, that did have that mainstream appeal. So mm it's possible, you know. I think I think Japan's one of the countries that people at least kind of identify some of the iconography of and are not I don't I don't broadly see as all that's terrifyingly different, which is really the litmus test for a lot of all. It's aspirational. Yeah, very much so. Um yeah, no, I've always wanted to be a large man who's hired to go to people's um funerals and such. That's uh definitely a dream of mine, Matthew. Um what do you think uh maybe that's an impossible question to answer.

Matthew
01:17:39
No god Say what's your dream role? What do you think you'd be best at?

Samuel
01:17:42
Oh, I think I'd be great as like a guy who is like the threatening grumpy sort of like fake boyfriend who's come to mess with this guy, but then I take a fall when the guy punches me. I just go straight down. Like the t a tiny tiny guy who wants to assert his manliness to impress his girl. I you know, I I sort of like uh hit lift weights for a week, walk in and then just sort of like go oi like that and then he just like punches me in the face and I go straight down and then his girlfriend's like incredibly impressed. I think that's the sort of thing that like I could do. What about you? Evil professor?

Matthew
01:18:18
Like I think I could be I think I'd I I could be a good like if you're in a really lousy play You can hire me to come and be a fake audience member. Yeah. Just to like feel out so the actors don't feel so sad. Like put me in the front row and I'll just be very vocal in my appreciation of it.

Samuel
01:18:36
Yeah. The other thing I could do is that sort of like uh no actually I'm not going into that. That's uh it's getting too it we're going too far down this rabbit hole for an XXL. It's getting a bit too about to make it weird, we it's getting a bit too paywalled back here, Matthew. Um Let's move on. To the one film I wish I had seen actually. If I had legs legs I'd kick you. Um this is a film you saw straight after Rental Family. And it seemed like a bit of a contrast, Matthew.

Matthew
01:19:00
Oh yeah, this was yeah, like being plunged into like a very, very cold bath after the warmth of rental family. This is about Basically Rose Byrne having a really terrible time looking after her sickly daughter while her husband is away on work. Her house is being renovated because of a l a huge sort of almost cosmic leak in the ceiling and she's stuck in this terrible motel. I mean I s I said there was like a hint of uncut gems to a bad of a small player, but there's a much bigger hint of uncut gems to this. It's like just a two-hour anxiety attack of Roseburn. Trying to deal with an impossible situation and it just escalating and escalating and her becoming more manic It's a little bit misleading to the thing a lot of people know about this film is that Conan O'Brien is in it in an acting role and plays her therapist. And because of that everyone goes, oh, this is probably gonna be like a comedy if Conan O'Brien's in it. And it has a couple of very funny moments, like big proper belly laughs, but I think those only come about because the rest of it is just so totally miserable and and hard work in but in in almost the best of ways. Um It so expertly captures the nightmare of her life. It's a a really claustrophobic film, like the camera is like constantly like up in her face. Like it quite an interesting stylistic touch. uh you never actually see her daughter. Like she's always just this off screen voice hur like haranguing her. She's very, very ill, but with a And it almost you can't quite place and I don't think he's ever said out loud, but seems to involve a feeding tube and gallons of this gunk that she's constantly putting into this machine, which is basically like the soundtrack to her life, this wheezing gunk machine. Fuck it out. And her sort of shrieking child. Which is just a horrible audio nightmare soundscape. I think on my letterbox review I likened it to the BBC sitcom Motherland. except directed by Ariaster, which I think is it like if if you have seen Motherland, which is like a very put upon mother but in a sitcom scenario This is like the super dark unpleasant version of it. Like she just isn't supported and watching her come to pieces is is quite upsetting. Um it's it's it's kind of it's like absolutely brilliant, but I also never want to see it again. Yeah. Like It's just it's not pleasurable in any way other than just the sheer like audacity of it and seeing Rose Byrne have this, like, a proper big performance to get her teeth into. Oh, it's a spitz in it where I I just had my head in my hands. I was like, oh god, like I just what would I do? What what could anyone do in this situation? And It's just a bit with a hamster which is just she buys this horrible, horrible hamster and it's the most evil looking thing I've ever seen. Like How they made this hamster look so evil, if it's animatronic or CG, I have no idea, but like like the cinema was just roaring with laughter, just as a pressure release. Yeah. Like, I can't believe that she's bought this. nightmare hamster into her life. Um oh it was yeah. It kind of does everything. You know, it's a proper immersive like cinema nightmare experience and whether or not that's something you want in your life, uh that's kind of up to you.

Samuel
01:22:45
It sounds almost like a razor head-ish, you know? It's Yeah.

Matthew
01:22:49
That's that's that's not far off. Like particularly the the the daughter stuff and like the biomechanical nature of whatever's going on with her. Yeah. Um it's terrible because like she was clearly a child in like a huge amount of pain and like really struggling. But You are just so dumb with this kid like ten minutes into the film and it r it it it the film really does a number on you in terms of getting you to like buy into her headspace where you're like, oh fuck, I'd just go. I'd just get in the car and just drive away and never come back. Like I just couldn't deal with it. Um Wow. Yeah. I I'll think of this film w the next time I feel like I'm overwhelmed in any way in my life and remember that, well, actually I don't have anything of like these kind of high stakes to deal with Um Christ. I think I Yeah, it's it's it's absolutely wild.

Samuel
01:23:45
Wow. I'll probably I'll probably catch this when it comes out properly. Um because I'm curious to see the Rose Burn performance more than anything. It's she's pretty high highly hotly tipped to um to get a best actress nomination for it. So uh Yeah.

Matthew
01:24:00
Yeah. It's interesting 'cause it's it's very adjacent to an another performance we'll get to in a bit and I could see both of those being in the mix for basically going through a similar kind of sort of trauma gauntlet.

Samuel
01:24:12
Yeah, then canceling each other out and someone else winning probably. But um Yeah, um, okay. Oh, interesting. Well, you know, uh a rough time, but uh yeah. I'm glad that I'm glad you went there while I went home with a a big bar of dairy milk and just sat in front of Mattelli. Oh I wish. Okay then. Oh I had a terror oh no I won't I won't tell that story.

Matthew
01:24:33
No go on.

Samuel
01:24:34
I kinda I kinda wanna hear it now. Go on.

Matthew
01:24:36
No well I But I won't go into detail. My stomach turned during watching this film. And so I was just under incredible pressure to get the fuck out of that cinema and go to the toilet.

Samuel
01:24:47
Oh wow, Christ, you really were having

Matthew
01:24:50
By the end of it I was like, oh I j genuinely thought I was gonna shoot myself at the end of this film.

Samuel
01:24:58
I feel like watching that evil gug go back and forth kind of helps, you know what I mean? I'll just be there thinking Just thinking about my own intestines at that point.

Matthew
01:25:06
I kept my stomach would settle down and I had a I had a bottle of Pepsi and then I'd drink that and then that would upset it again. I was like, oh I kept forgetting about the Pepsi. Oh dear. That's uh that is funny. Um I would say uh of all the films I saw, If I Had Legs I Kick You is the least Tango Ice Blast film.

Samuel
01:25:27
Oh god, the other day do you know that Bic Morrison's in town, right? You can go in there and buy Tango Blast. They got a sign outside. And then I just thought, if I ever order a Tango Blast outside the confines of an Odeon. Like my life has truly gone to shit. And I would really hope that someone would ha stage an intervention at that point and be like, No, you do not drink those unless you're seeing a film.

Matthew
01:25:51
Like there's no uh you should not be drinking that like a side. You can hire me to tell you to get your life straight.

Samuel
01:25:59
And then but then as you're doing it you're like, oh I need to go to the bathroom, sorry, you just run off. Um okay. Um moving on then to less um yes, less toilet-based uh subject matter. Um The Secret Agent. In nineteen seventy seven, a technology expert flees from a mysterious past and returns to his hometown of Recife in Brazil in search of peace. He soon realizes that the city is far from being the refuge. He seeks. So, um, this is set in the bad Brazil times, Matthew, when um the cops were massively corrupt. I mean, I think they've had a lot of like upheaval over the years with this stuff, but Um this this film I think is set in this a similar time period to last year's I'm Still Here, um which is a film I quite liked but was a little bit little bit stayed and traditional, a little bit of a classic Oscar Beatty film. Um This is kind of like a thriller that uses that as a historical context. This guy is basically undercover and is being hunted down. by someone he he crossed paths with. And because this is a a period in Brazilian history where if you want someone off you can pay people to do that. Um, you know, that's the part of the peril of the film. He's trying to sort of like hold on to the bits of his life that he has while also remaining undercover. Um but uh yes, it's it it's sort of an espionage thriller at its heart, really. The title I think is Um it's is smart because it it makes the film maybe sound a little bit more James Bond-ish than it actually is. Um nothing to do with Joseph Conrad, obviously. Um it's Wagner Mora is the star. It's two hours and 38 minutes long, but I saw Matthew outside the screening for this and I was like, that fucking flew by. Because it is really exciting and i uh genuinely like inventive. Like it it has like a a couple of tricks up its sleeve, which I definitely won't spoil here. Um but I think the was just like a a big surprise of the of the film festival. Like I I'd heard this was good but This was probably my number one film of the festival. And so I would recommend it wholeheartedly. It's it's like it's it's really exciting in that kind of slightly, I guess like you know, uncut gems, pressure cooker kind of way. There's like the feeling that something uh f forces are homing honing in on this guy And you don't know exactly how things are going to pan out because even though it's based on a on real history, the character is fictional. So um I think it's just a really smart thriller built using real world history. What did you think, Matthew?

Matthew
01:28:44
Yeah, and that that that's that's I think that what surprised me the most, like how good uh technical thriller and just in terms of how exciting it was and the tension and you know, the there's only a couple of proper set pieces in it, but when they happen, it you know, it is really, really exciting. Um but at the same time is, you know, very intelligent and meaningful and emotional and obviously drawing on this like rich history, it's very like political. um but without ever becoming like too heavy or too worthy. Like the characters in it in they're all very kind of relatable and There's a lot of very good villains in this and the film spends quite a lot of time with like hitmen and corrupt cops and dodgy businessmen and i i I wouldn't say it necessarily like like puts meat on their bones that they're these like fully fleshed out characters, but you you have an understanding of them and you get to spend time with them. I don't want to say they're like It's like incorrect to say it's like Tarantino-y in in that sort of novelistic way, but the the way the story does just flip between all these different characters and gradually the picture comes together at the same time that it kind of comes together as a thriller. Like I I was just so so surprised at just how entertaining that was while also being, you know, what I would consider like quite traditional, like art house cinema fair, you know, a Brazilian film that requires a bit of knowledge of like Brazilian history to understand, uh though the film explains itself pretty well. Um yeah, like not at all as I was I thought it was gonna be chin stroking and actually it was nail biting.

Samuel
01:30:31
Yeah. Yeah, I think you're right actually. It's like the you just think I think maybe from that subject matter that it's going to be a bit more worthy than it actually is, but it's just really, yeah, like Matthew says, great great thriller construction. So That is a wholehearted recommendation from me. Yeah, that was great. If you can catch one film out of any of the ones that I'm going to talk about, I would say this is the this is definitely the one. Um so yeah, really uh Yeah, not yeah, surprise not quite the right word, but I guess I just didn't expect it to be quite this good. Um it's really something. Next film then Matthew is Pillion, a film we both saw. A directionless man is swept off his feet when an enigmatic, impossibly handsome biker takes him on and his as his submissive. This film stars Alexander Skarsgod, um attractive uh Viking man and um Harry Melling, who you may know from the Queen Scambit and also the Harry Potter movies, and looks like a character from the Beano. Um and the contrast of the these two men physically as they, you know, embark on this this relationship um is part of the joy of this film which is it is a comedy with dramatic elements and it's essentially about how frosty and unknowable the Skarsgord character is. And you know how a appealing he is as well, frankly, because he is he is an extraordinary looking man. Going around in his like cool motorbike uh sort of like uh uh you know sort of like leather and whatever and meanwhile harry melling's playing this dorky uh traffic cop basically um just sort of like doling out parking tickets and such And uh yeah, but it's what I think what I thought was really impressive about this film is that it is It is funny, but it's like the tonal range of it and how it's able to turn on a dime from being quite tender about Harry Merling's character and his relationship to his family, like he still lives with his parents. and still very close with his parents, you know, to to basically being these like gay sexual encounters in public that are quite explicitly drawn in the film. Without it breaking the tone of the film. But I think it helps it to feel pretty authentic and yeah, I just thought it was quite deft how it managed uh manages to balance that And uh yeah, I think this is a film this was a little bit more of a punt for me, take, you know, watching this. I was a bit like, that sounds interesting. And I think Skarsgard's an executive producer on it. I thought I'll I just kind of want to see what this is about and how they balance it. I like both those performers. What do you make of this, Matthew?

Matthew
01:33:14
Yeah, I I I'd agree with all that. I I was surprised at how funny it was or that it had, you know, almost the shape of a comedy. Like the you know you know, the underlying joke of, you know, this incredibly sort of like, you know, um like Middle Britain kind of middle class, very safe, very boring lifestyle guy gets sort of pulled into quite an extreme relationship with with Skarsgord. And, you know, there's comedy there, like his his parents are just so sort of gentle and like what he's getting up to is just so extreme. you know uh uh and there is a film where that is just the that is the whole flavour of it like oh isn't it funny that this that this is kind of going on and almost a bit sort of full Monty-ish or something um But then it is also like quite like you say quite an explicit uh depiction, you know, of this submissive relationship. And I mean that's that's like a world which, you know, I I know very little about. Uh you don't say about it I I watched this film and thought, you know what, that is not for me. Um But like he kind of sort of f sort of finds himself in it's it's kind of a odd like you know on paper it's it's it's not miles away from like uh you know someone has their first major relationship and learns a lot about themselves It's just the thing that they learn about themselves is quite far outside the norm. Uh and and and so it kinda you know, it there's some kind of quite cliched safe and obvious structural ideas in this, but the actual subject matter is is so not that that I think that's where that sort of like interesting tension lies. I I think me and Catherine disagreed a little bit on this one in the end. Not not in terms of its quality, but You know, I thought it was I thought it was like incredibly sad um by the ending and I wasn't sure it was really a happy ending. But then I don't know if that's just you know, I'm so Like, not of that world. You know, I almost get like it's almost too alien for it. Like I couldn't really get my head around like him having a good time. Uh If that's not too kind of weird a way to put it. You know, I was almost like, uh you know, oh that seems it seems really sort of sad and downtrodden. And it's like, well, maybe that's the thing though. That's the That's the nature of like the you know what he what he wants. Um so like that that's the only bit I couldn't quite put my finger on.

Samuel
01:35:53
Well, it's funny because I think that a a a sort of underlying theme of the film is that being lonely can be sorry, being gay can be quite lonely. Um just that like, you know, there is Uh you see him at the um at one point in the film just uh filling out his grinder profile and grinder is basically like a you know like a meat market of like meeting dudes. It's not really you know, from what everything I hear, not massively conducive to necessarily meeting people who you want to be in a long-term relationship with. It's a lot it's more like Um if it basically if if like straight grinder existed it would be the end of civilization, like we'd just be absolute fucking carnage. Um it just wouldn't I just don't think it'd really function. Um so in some ways if I'm like a bit of a flip side of All of Us Strangers, which is a a gay film that is also about like being lonely and gay, I think. And so and I but I think that like your your sort of like you know, you knocking at the door of this world and being like, I'm not totally sure what's going on inside there. I would say that the secretary is probably quite a good comparison point to this, where It's like a love story, but there's something for its time. The secretary I think was quite transgressive. I would say that by modern standards, not really transgressive at all. Um, if anything, like the HR violations in that film would be the thing that people get it in more it up in arms about these days than the spanking. But what I mean is about like the idea of it being trying to be something Potentially being something sweet or a love story in the midst of something that seems quite extreme, you know? Um, but it's sort of like I don't I think I think it is quite a sad film in some ways. And Yeah, I do think that there's a there's a little bit of like how much are you willing to give versus how much are you willing to just sort of like make sure you have your own little part of this relationship? And that is the core tension of the film. And explored very, very well. Um it's a very committed performance by both actors. It felt very authentic, I think.

Matthew
01:37:57
Yeah. Yeah. No, uh it's i yeah, not not at all what I was expecting. Just uh Yeah, a little a little tricky to kind of completely square the I you know you know traditionally When people are treated badly, you know, that's a negative character trait. You know, we're programmed to read that as a negative character trait. But if that is at the heart of your submissive relationship with someone, then it becomes quite hard to like read and unpick. Um I think that's that would that was really it where I was like, I don't know. He seems bad, but maybe that's good? I don't know. I don't know.

Samuel
01:38:37
So what you're saying is you wouldn't make uh potato dauphinoise for Alexander Skarsgard, Matthew. That's your your read on this.

Matthew
01:38:43
uh ultimately I didn't I didn't get that but so 'cause that's one of the like the early bits of their relationship. He's just like if if you come and live with me you've just got to cook you know you've got to cook all my meals for me and he's like well I can't cook And he's like, you've just gotta cook all my meals for me. I wouldn't wanna eat someone's like fucking rank food just to like prove a point, you know? He's gonna have a worse life just because he's adhering to his his own like mad value system. Uh well that seems bonkers to me. Like they I say they eat precisely one meal that they both seem to enjoy in this film, and uh it isn't cooked it isn't cooked by Harry Melling, that's for sure. Um I think I think that the dominant the the Dom sub dynamic in this film is designed to be

Samuel
01:39:32
like a more extreme version of what similar uh what like a real life version that dynamic might be. Oh because the guy is so no I yeah again I wouldn't know. Well the guy is so like it's so heightened. He's like a biker in this like biker gang of dudes who I thought were gonna be like white supremacists. Like I thought that because they were all like bold and like had tattoos and stuff and I thought when's the when's the other shoe gonna drop that it turns out that they're all racist. But that didn't happen. Um and so You think they're gonna have dangerous breed dogs, but they actually like dressing up as leather dogs. So it's a bit like I think it's meant to be like a very heightened version of what that kind of dynamic might be. But again, it's not a world I'm familiar with either. So but you know, like I think I think that's fairly evident from the text anyway. Um anyway, it interesting film and I just uh yeah, I I I thought honestly like uh well worth watching even if you th if you're a bit like Matthew and you're a little bit like I don't totally get what this is or what the appeal of this is.

Matthew
01:40:36
No, uh no, that's I think that's obvious. Like you were I was just like, this is something so out of my wheelhouse, like I don't really know what the what what

Samuel
01:40:43
you know what the read on it is. Yeah, exactly. Um okay, well fair enough. Let's move on then Matthew to sentimental value. Wish them well. Sentimental value. Um okay so um this is a film about A fractured relationship between the claimed director played by Stenham Skarsgard and his two estranged daughters, which becomes even more complicated when he decides to make a personal film about their family history. This film also co-stars um Renata Rensvi and it's a film um made by um Joeichim Joachim Tria, don't know if I'm saying his name correctly, Matthew there, um and um also co-stars um El Fanning Yeah, it's uh about this patriarch who is sort of, I think, obsessed with his own myth a little bit, but is is kind of a has been at the same time. And um his daughters certainly feel abandoned, but those you know, th they they have they have each other. And so when he comes back into their lives, and there's also like a bit of his a bit of career opportunism um about the whole thing. They are skeptical and you know, and because it's about their lives as well and their family history, it's the subject matter of the film, he wants to make it. It sort of becomes even more prickly um because of that. So I thought I would really like this film because I really liked um uh the worst person in the world, which was Tria's last film, and also starred Ronaldo Rensvi. And I really like the performances in this. I thought that the two the two sisters were were amazing. I thought El Fanning was great in this, like maybe the best thing I've ever seen her in. And instead of Skarsgard, I mean between this and and or season two, I think like Might be one of the best years of his career ever. Like really super impressive. But um for whatever reason this doesn't quite this didn't quite click with me emotionally. Like I didn't I did believe they were a a real family and that they had like this real trauma that they all shared, but it was for some reason it just didn't work and I found it a little bit long. What did you think?

Matthew
01:42:52
Me and Catherine were like discussing this quite you know, pretty much all through dinner. Um you know, v various light disagreements over certain characters and whether everyone was as bad as they seemed. I th I think both uh like a huge pro of this film is that it's like all the characters are like they're very like psychologically real and like well realized. No one is like an out and out villain. Everyone you can sort of see where they're coming from, but you can also understand how it is that they've damaged the other people in their lives. And like As a result, I don't want to say like the film's too reasonable because of that, but I I did find it quite hard to, you know, I sort I could you could sort of see everyone's perspective so well and so clearly. uh that I did find it kind of uh it never really like exploded, kind of conflict wise for me You know, I I I i it was almost like it did sort of like too good a job of humanizing everyone. Like it needed, you know, Stellan Skarsgård to be like a bit more of a shit, maybe. Yeah. Um were actually like he had some like real qualities to him, like the things that drove him. I think this is what me and Catherine really disagreed on. I th I thought you know, in the pantheon of bad cinema dads, he's like far from the worst. Um you know, in that you know, and whether this excuses it, different different readings for different people I guess, but in that you know, a lot of his failures came from did come from him, like, being quite a gifted filmmaker, it seems, and pursuing that at the expense of his family. I'm not saying that's good behaviour or that you you can forgive that, but I, you know, I didn't feel like he was c a complete bust. Like there was sort of some admiration for him there and they could see like how gifted he was and like when they're part of his little world it really excites them and you know uh I I just yeah It's it's it's a bit of a weird criticism to be like this film is just too subtle.

Samuel
01:45:05
Um lacks too much lacks tension, that's that's fair. I think that's a good criticism.

Matthew
01:45:10
It's almost like a really psychologically real version of the Royal Tenon Bones.

Samuel
01:45:15
Yeah, I could see that. It's sort of like I I think the other thing is that the most explosive tension in the film is quite early on. And so it's sort of on a very steady uh sort of slight slope from there down and then never gets that tense again. Um like there's a Renato Rensvy and Stellan Skarsgard like in a in like a bar, um a conversation they have. It's really as tense as it gets and then Yeah, I think you're right. Everyone's perspective is is respected, but perhaps it could have done with a little bit more of like people behaving irrationally as people do in real life that you know to create that tension. I don't know.

Matthew
01:45:51
And I I don't think it helped that you know, I've seen some like very intense characters in these last couple of weeks in other films. Yeah. Like After if I had legs I'd kick you. You know, these characters seem they all seem really nice to me. And you're like, oh, I'd quite like to hang out with most of the people in this film. Like they all they all seem okay. Um there's a version of this where Stellan Skarsgard is like a total monster and it's like a m but actually he's he's quite charming, he's quite reasonable, but like I think hi the scenes he shares with Elle Fanning, who's this like American actress he brings in to be in the film in s in s instead of his daughter, you know they are kind of creatively frustrating for him, but I think he's also so like reasonable and decent with her that I think that That smooths a lot of his edges off and He's never like everyone is really kind to like one person in this film and you kinda come away going Oh, well yeah, they they all seemed all right I guess.

Samuel
01:46:57
Yeah. Yeah, I think I think you might be right. It's I think th the perhaps the suggestion is that Stellan Skarsgard has been worse than he is now.

Matthew
01:47:06
And so that's yeah, and you don't get to see any of it. It's talked about and I think the fact that you never meet their mother I wonder if that character would maybe change your perspective a little bit.

Samuel
01:47:16
Yeah, that's that's possible, for sure. But uh yeah, a definitely lacking attention, but Uh four great performances. Like the um the the actress who plays the the other sister opposite Renata Rensfi is Inga. Ibsdotter Lilias, I'm probably pronouncing that terribly, um, but um alas. And I don't really know that actress, but um I mean she has very, very striking eyes for one. Um like every time she was on the screen I was like wow her eyes are very like piercing. Um but also just really, really good and um really holds her own against Renato Rensvi, who is in the worst person in the world and um, you know, is clearly someone who the uh who The the director likes Philbake has a very interesting face and um you know this director is very good at capturing.

Matthew
01:48:01
It does it does commit that kind of cardinal sin of presenting her as this sort of uh character can't like ever get a boyfriend or like isn't a pee and I'm like that's ridiculous. Like she looks abs she looks absolutely amazing. She's got she's sort of seeing this like absolute troll man Like r like relative to her. Uh and he's like, uh, I don't know about this. And I'm like, that is just not what would happen. That is So false.

Samuel
01:48:29
Wasn't he the same guy who was in The Worst Person in the World as well? Was he the guy who played the graphic novel, the right-way graphic novel guy she's dating? But you're right, it's it is preposterous the idea she couldn't hold down a relationship. I'm like, I'm sorry, but that but yeah, she just Again, um very very beautiful person, but um yeah, I um it's true that the film doesn't really take any shortcuts to make Stellan Skarsgard worse than he is. I mean He does like there's a whole sequence of him and El Fanny on a beach and you would think in like a conventional Hollywood film you would expect him to be leching on her a little bit or whatever. There's like nothing even vaguely in that register in this. It's like Matthew says that everyone Is at pains to be quite neutral with everyone else. And so it just means there's like no the frequency doesn't really blip much in either direction. No. Um and so the film is not ultimately that successful, I don't think. But um I do recommend watching The Worst Person in the World.

Matthew
01:49:29
I think that is better than this.

Samuel
01:49:30
Did you do you think that was better than this as well?

Matthew
01:49:32
Uh I think so, yeah. There's just a bit a yeah, a bit more going on with that character and the sort of slightly ghastly people around her.

Samuel
01:49:39
Indeed. Well two more films, Matthew. Next up is Begonia, um, the latest film from Jorgos Lanthamos who directed Poor Things. And what was that one last year that was way too long and it's a good idea? And uh yeah, it's you know, also made the favourite and you've probably seen something he's made by now. He's been one of the things that I've got to do. you know, the big awards circuit fixtures of the last few years. This another collaboration with Emma Stone. Um two conspiracy obsessed young men kidnap the high powered CEO of a major company, convinced that she is an alien intent on destroying planet Earth. Now Matthew, I have not spoken to you since you've seen this one 'cause you watched it today. What did you make of Begonia?

Matthew
01:50:20
Uh I I thought it was fine. Um I it's a remake of a Korean film called Save the Green Planet, which I had seen and I didn't really remember, but as I was watching the film I I began getting like threads of, oh yeah, I can kind of remember stuff like this happening before and uh maybe I'm misremembering this, but I felt like a lot of the films like biggest s swings were kind of already in that film, um, which maybe slightly lessens it. Um I I actually thought this was uh I The first half of it I found incredibly slow, with lots of people having quite long, not very interesting conversations. I think Jesse Plemens is actually like too low-key in this film for me. Um he sort of plays the sort of sort of conspiracy nut sort of not not I wouldn't say quite say that I don't think he's specifically an incel as such, but you know, internet dwelling person who's who's just too online and lost himself to it. Um uh but I I just I found him like a little bit kind of monotone and uninteresting and uh it sort of slowed it all right down for me. Like it should have this quite hectic energy, this whole kind of You know, the whole thing hinges on like is this per you know it you know is there any truth in what he's saying or is it is he got like completely the wrong end of the stick and the kind of tension there is like, you know, is he gonna end up you know, just torturing a relatively innocent woman to death and um but I don't know if any of that particularly holds up, A because I found him Like I say, so subdued. But also, I think the f the film does a little bit of like eat the rich stuff with her in that she's a she's a sort of terrible uh head of some evil conglomerate who's, you know, poisoning the environment and driving up pharmaceutical prices and all this. And that actually does rob it of that tension of like Do you actually care i if this person's alright in the end or not? You know, like y she sort of presented as a villain either way. Like she's either an alien out to destroy the earth, or she's this evil businesswoman out to destroy the earth. And either you know, I think he even says at one point, like, you know, even if she's not, like she still sucks 'cause of this other stuff. And you're like, well Then are we invested in this at all as an idea? Like if it doesn't matter what the outcome is? Uh that's sort of how I felt.

Samuel
01:52:55
Yeah, I uh I agree. It was It's another film where I feel like the guy making it just doesn't care about any of his characters or doesn't have any investment in the story he's telling. He's just trying to show me how smart he is and It just bothered me a little bit. Like I just wasn't I did think Ple I thought Blemmens is really good in this. Like I think it's a a register where he is so subdued. Because like he has almost come had to completely reprogram his brain to deal with a bunch of trauma in his life. And um and so I think that the fundamental truths he believes they're all like untruths. That's just like he's made his choice now and he just has to like double down, triple down. And you know, if anything, it could have been a slightly more cliched with the the sort of like doubt they could have explored there, but he's just so single-minded about it. I don't I I I thought he was the best part of the film for sure. And Emma Stone is good, but it's a very so I would say it's quite easy performance for Emma Stone.

Matthew
01:53:55
It's just evil CEO lady.

Samuel
01:53:57
Well guess what? They're fucking ten a penny. Um so who cares? And um yeah, but you know, but nonetheless she is still good. But yeah, I I said this to you. I think it's got a slight whiff of a Twilight Zone episode plot about it. And so there's not that much to the story. And so what you're kind of like you know, you are waiting to find out is this is she an alien? Is she not an alien? Like In either way, um, you know, like you say, she is evil, but it's just I just thought there wasn't much meat on the bones to the plot besides that. It was just half an hour's worth of plot to me, stretched over two hours. And so a lot of it's just about all the rancid shit they do to Eberstone while she's in their basement. Or like all the other things they you know, other things they end up doing, you know, this horrible little house they live in and the relationship between the two men and Yeah. You know, some of the bad stuff that's happened to the Jesse Plemens character in the past is sort of yadda-yaddered a little bit by the film. And like, uh dunno Just uh it's uh it was it was fine, like you say, fine.

Matthew
01:54:58
I I think part of the problem about any film that's satirizing our our current moment, particularly when you're dealing with like the biggies you know, the companies that own everything or or environmental destruction. Like it's it's just very, very hard for a film to like anger or scare me more than things you read in headlines. Like it it's almost like an impossible task. Like, weirdly, the angriest I probably felt about our current moment, watching any film, was watching the nineteen seventies Brazilian thriller. Just because the corruption was just so brazen, you were like, oh well that's what they're doing right now, you know, just to have it rubbed in your face and have shitty businessmen who are friends with like the people in power can basically just come and take whatever they want and you just have to like eat shit and like it. Like that made me way more cross. Like I was seething during that film than anything in this which is ostensibly about, you know what's happening to us right now and that's uh I just think that's a huge obstacle for you know any filmmaker to overcome. It was the same problem that fucking mountain head earlier in the year. Yeah. You know, it's just like Well, I hate the real people more than I hate these fake evil bastards, so why why even bother?

Samuel
01:56:19
You're failing to meet the moment by just putting it on the screen, I think. You're just you're not You're not investigating you're not interrogating it, you're not saying anything. You're not actually like you know your film has no no meaning in that context. It's just like oh it's a water yeah, like you say watered down version of something you already experienced like What is the next level up from that? That's what filmmakers should be doing. What is. How do you go further? I would argue this is actually why I like the film Eddington this year. Because I think that film's a bit more like. you know, here's what is actually wrong with people's brains and here's how fucked we are basically and it's so darkly Uh it's it just has such a dark perspective on the world as it is now that it really spoke to me because I was like, Oh, there's someone he's actually saying what it is. He's actually but he's actually like il illuminating what it is. He's not just like literally putting on the screen what it is. And so I think that's um Maybe a key distinction. Yeah, I agree with you there. Um just uh I this is one that's like slid a bit in my estimations in the couple of weeks since I've seen it, I think. But um It's alright, you know, it's okay. There's nothing bad about it. I I was just a little bit so what, you know?

Matthew
01:57:28
Yeah, um okay, yeah. So I'll take it over his lot I hated Kinds of Kindness. I thought that was absolutely ghastly. So um I just like arch as some of his worst films are.

Samuel
01:57:40
Yeah, that is why that's why I skipped kinds of kindness. It just looked like oh god. It just looked like the whole film was going, eh, fuck you, basically. That was like what I got from the trailer. And it's three hours long. No thank you. Um okay, so Last film, Matthew, to end on a on a jolly note, uh Die My Love, um from director Lynn Ramsey. Um Grace, a writer and young mother, is slowly slipping into madness, locked away in an old house in and around Montana. We see her acting increasingly agitated and erratic, leaving her companion, Jackson increasingly worried and helpless. Uh it's a film about postpartum depression and the extreme places it takes this character, Grace, played by Jennifer Lawrence. played very well by Jennifer Lawrence. And Robert Pattinson plays her husband who is um trying his best but um is perhaps not up to the task. um of what um his partner is going through. At the same time, you know, seemingly at his behest they have moved to this shitty house in the middle of nowhere um that basically forms this this prison um for this new family and um I thought it was I w I sort of respected it A lot. And I thought the second hour was better than the first actually. I felt like um it's the the most I've seen Jennifer Lawrence reached her full potential in a film in a long time. I thought she was really up to the task, Matthew. And I thought RPAS was decent as well. Um And yeah, but it's undeniably a hard watch, so this would be the thing that pairs with um if I had legs I would kick you, right?

Matthew
01:59:15
Yeah, just another portrait of someone coming apart. I guess the The difference is, you know, if I had legs, it, you know, it paints a very clear picture of what all the stress points are in her life, while this one, you know, it is about the great unknowability of unknowableness of um depression and just something that seizes the mind And I think maybe as a result it may it it it like it's like saying, oh it's less satisfying. I think in the way that you know, mental illness is unsatisfying, you know, for people who have it. It's it's just unjustified and it just it just happens, you know? And As a result, it's like trying to watch a like mood piece where I think someone's tried to capture that headspace. But you could maybe accuse it of being quite one note, because it it you know, it doesn't feel like a descent, I wouldn't say. Um, you know, it's She's sort of fine and then suddenly she's not, and then she's not for a long time, and some wilder things happen, but it's not like there are different things enter her life. Um Yeah, I it's it's

Samuel
02:00:34
Yeah, this is probably also the hardest film for like two blokes to weigh in on out of all these. Um, in some ways I think that Maybe if you've been through postpartum depression, you could see this as a pretty definitive text on how it feels, if not what it actually is, you know. Um Uh I think that that's probably that feels like what that film's going for to me. It's like because I don't think it's wholly saying that this is what postpartum depression does to you. I think some of it they're saying is like just part of who Grace is as a person, the film definitely suggests that. But um, you know, it's it's amplifying all of the um the bad impulses she has and the you know the the horrible things it's it leads her to do and the you know very uh unexpected erratic things that she does. Yeah, it's um I could see it sort of uh speaking to a certain part of the audience for sure, you know? Yeah and I

Matthew
02:01:29
I would say I think of of a lot, you know, maybe no other choice aside. I you know, I I thought this was like visually like one of the more striking films. Like it there there are a lot of quite dreamy, weird visuals and like you know, framing devices and perspective shifts and um I it Mm it helps that she behaves quite weirdly, Jennifer Lawrence, and she so she gets to you know, Lynn Ramsey gets to film Jennifer Lawrence doing some quite odd things and like moving in quite an odd way. I thought it was you know Intr even in the moments I didn't like fully like understand it or appreciate or like enjoy it, I always thought it looked amazing and had a real kind of like you know visual energy to it. Um you know, without descending too much into sort of just like sort of dreamy, sort of unknowable logic. Like it was quite it was quite beautiful while also being you know, some of the worst moments of this person's life. Um Yeah. Yeah, I I liked, you know, chi you know, Lynn Ramsey is is a you know, an amazing filmmaker um like is br is brilliant at bringing those worlds to life. And you know that's that's still true of this. Um Yeah. And I do think Jennifer Lawrence is amazing in it. She just uh I think it's quite hard for like beautiful Hollywood stars to sometimes feel like, oh, they're just acting this you know, that's so clearly a performance or it's so clearly an experience which is like outside of their beautiful Hollywood lives. Yeah. But you never once think, Oh, that's p that's like fake or artificial in any way. Like she really seems kind of cracked behind the ice. Like she's an amazing actress.

Samuel
02:03:21
Yeah, she is. She ri Yeah. I I I completely agree with that. And I think as well, like it just feels like maybe being in that particular setting It just feels like her and Pattinson are completely immersed in the reality of that relationship. Yeah. And so maybe filming it in a kind of isolated space like that helps with that feeling, you know? Um but yeah, very they're very committed to performances. They're very like you know, they're unvarnished performances.

Matthew
02:03:50
Um yeah, it's uh Yeah. I wonder if Like people are gonna turn out for this expecting like oh Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Patterson together, that's gonna be like really hot as a combo. And they'd just be incredibly upset by some of the stuff that happens in this film. Yeah. I wonder if it's like any it's it's like there's like loads of nudity and sex in it, but it's an incredibly like sort of unotic film.

Samuel
02:04:15
Oh yeah. In no way we be anyone be thirsting after Jennifer Lawrence. It's just not that kind of film. It's it's sort of like yeah, it's I I wonder if they might try and market it as uh you know, this year's um we live in time and it's so not that. Um but like it's I think in some ways they're gonna need uh bank on the star power of those two actors to get people to see it because If you show people what the film actually is in the trailer, no one will go and see it. You know, it's you can but it's well worth watching. That's the thing. It's a great work. It's just Yeah.

Matthew
02:04:50
Yeah.

Samuel
02:04:51
Complicated. Um Yeah.

Matthew
02:04:53
It's a this is a kind of a bummer to be the last one of the film festival. Yeah, it was a little bit. You know, sad I w what what would you w rather have finished on?

Samuel
02:05:04
Uh Predator Badlands, Matthew, I think. I would have said rental family. No, I would have said rental family too, but um I saw the bus advert for Predator Badland, so I thought, you know, I'm well up for watching that, so that'll be uh that'll be good. Um what would you uh recommend to your to our listeners most out of that lot, Matthew? Um I think realistically people will probably go and see two or three of these, so uh what do you reckon?

Matthew
02:05:26
W Wake Up Dead Man is a very easy recommendation. Just like it's a it's a very easy mainstream watch. So I'd like to say The Secret Agent. I don't think it is too high for leaning for people. I think people should just take a punt on it and and it you know, even if you're not normally into subtitled film, I think you'll be surprised at how much it works as a thriller.

Samuel
02:05:46
Yeah, I agree with that. Um good recommendations, yeah. Uh I would say so I think definitely the secret agent, I agree with Matthew on that one. Um I think Pillion if you think you've got the you know if you if you think you're the right kind of person to you know, appreciate the subject matter um to engage with it on something. Don't go with your your mates. Yeah, and then uh I think I would say I'd say rental family or roofman are like good like crowd places. And I just think that's okay to to just watch one of those as well. Like um you go to a film festival expecting to to have to run the gamut of tone. But you know it was nice to Seeing both those films was like r was really welcome in in amongst all the other stuff. So um yeah, those are cool. I like the frivolous ones more.

Matthew
02:06:39
Yeah. Well at least well I Even though I they're not not as good a films often, they're definit like I can see myself watching the frivolous ones again. Like I'm never watching Dime I Love and if I had legs I'd kick you again. Yeah. I probably wouldn't watch Pillion again. I like I know what it's about. I've I've I've absorbed it. Um You know, I don't need a second trip to the forest in that one.

Samuel
02:07:07
Oh, if you knew what the forest scene was, you would laugh so much. That's Matthew's mentioned the forest with like three different WhatsApp messages to me at this point. Um yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing Wake Up Dead Man as well. And uh they had me at Bar Film Festival though. I would have ended it on Predator Badlands and I'd I'd have got up where they were the microphone, I'd have brushed burst past the person in the front, got the microphone and go Hello everyone, I'm Samuel Roberts from the uh Bar Film Festival commit committee. This is a little special little film to me, a personal little film to me, called Predator Badlands. I've not seen it, but I know who the Predator is. Half of Elfanning as a robot is strapped to this uh this bloke in a predator suit who's jumping around, so uh enjoy. And that'll be it. And then people will give me a little round of applause and uh then they get on with it, Matthew. And that's the would you have done it as an L fanning double bill with sentimental value? Well that's the that's the thing. It is like quite a good it was nice seeing her do something more interesting than she was doing in a complete unknown. What a dud role that was, really. Um not her fault, it was just very underwritten. But uh Yeah, um anyway, um it was fun going th going to see all those films, Matthew. It's it's just cool to to check out a bunch of films in a row like this, isn't it? And then um have nothing to see in like November and December because you've spalled it all in advance. But um Okay Matthew, with indeed, we're out of here, but the next Patreon episode is Two Giant Men Play Super Mario Galaxy 2, which follows a free feed episode. Two men play Super Mario Galaxy. So I think very different tone to uh Dime My Love talking about the uh the planets of that game, Matthew. I look forward to it. Um yes. Okay. Goodbye.
