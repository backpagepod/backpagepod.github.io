Hello and welcome to the Backpage XL, a patron exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello Matthew. I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you how you feel the draft results are going so far. Terribly for me. I I sort of you're doing worse than I thought you would do, considering you had, you know, Super Metroid, um, for example, but yeah.

Matthew
00:45
I I mean, it was we talk about the draft stuff in in DMs to one another and I always thought Dave and Ash would have a a bit of a hurdle with the listeners, 'cause I thought there was uh a bit of host affinity. doing a bit of heavy lifting in the previous results. Uh but this one's actually, you know, put put uh put that to bed as a theory. 'Cause yeah, they're absolutely storming it. So it turns out they were just picking really shit games before.

Samuel
01:13
I think it was a really good call to tell them I need you to compete and take this seriously and like take on Matthew and you know sort of take him down. I feel like they took that to heart and actually did compete pretty hard. And uh I think actually you had more sort of lived in heart picks than anyone by picking in like be putting in Eternal Champions for example, which which you know is no Street Fire 2, but it's a game that you actually played and have sort of had some thoughts on. So You know, you uh it's it's okay. It's like you can lose one. You've won all the other ones.

Matthew
01:45
Oh yeah, it's it's it's absolutely fine.

Samuel
01:48
Um does does not affect my mental health one bit. I can tell Dave really wants to win, which is funny. Like he keeps going into the Discord and sort of doing a bit of the old vote quimby uh I would say um sort of drive bys.

Matthew
02:00
Then why did he pick Earth One Gym 2? I I think that is a I genuinely think that's a stinker.

Samuel
02:05
Yeah, I don't really uh know much about that series generally, but I think that um he just played it smartly by picking even when he's picked SNES games that I don't think are Like very interesting now. Like I when I listen back to it, I really wish we'd gone weapons free on Super Mario RPG and being quite boring, which I feel like everyone was reminded of when it came out on Switch a couple of years ago. Yeah. Um But um yeah, but didn't because it was like hour three of the podcast and I was tired, you know.

Matthew
02:30
Snez Mini plugged in uh at what used to be the Green Park Tavern, that pub on the corner. They had a SNES Mini plugged in and I loaded up Super Mario RPG on there and every save file had played just two minutes of it. And I thought, yeah, that's Super Mario RPG for you.

Samuel
02:48
Yeah, an awesome thing to discover exists. Um it was an awesome thing to discover on the virtual console and Wii in like 2008 or 9. Um, but you know, when you can play it versus like any other uh there's like five to ten better Japanese RPGs on that system. But he was going for the old Mario name recognition, so yeah.

Matthew
03:07
It is really interesting that I've seen some people, you know, quite a few people say it's gotta be this because of Street Fighter and how certain genres just seem to carry a lot more weight in this draft than they ever do. Like Fighting game has never ever decided a draft before. But for some reason, this era the fighting games really, really matter. So I wish I'd put a bit more thought into that. I just assumed Ah, well even a good fighting game won't make a difference, but Turns out I was wrong.

Samuel
03:36
Well the truth is I think that it was I think for you it was not having a strong enough platformer ultimately was w what sort of like has did you a bit of damage.

Matthew
03:46
Oh I was thinking about trying to like hold my nose and take Uh Donkey Kong Country 2. But I just I just couldn't do it. I couldn't do that to myself. So um yeah, Kirby, a heart pick, but the wrong pick.

Samuel
04:00
Well, it's okay. I mean, I'm really glad that Dave and Ash are proper competitors. It looks like Ash is probably gonna win the draft, which is um you know, which is cool um that we um that that is possible. Ash really did enhance the episode with his knowledge as well as A couple of listeners pointed out, you know, he just really knows his stuff around 16-bit. In general, I think I'm actually surprised we came away unscathed making an episode all about that generation without people being like This sounds a bit phony or like you're out of your depth, you know? We we survived and and thrived somehow and um I really uh we we stayed away from doing any drafts around those consoles for so so long. And it's I'm pleased we went into it and then, you know, managed to sort of survive unscathed at the other side, you know. That's kind of a relief. So yeah. Um well the podcast turns five years old this week, Matthew. So back in twenty twenty, in the midst of, you know, the COVID psychic damage times, we I finally managed to coax you into doing this after about, I don't know, ten months to a year of It's sort of badgering, you know, it's been a while. Um this is all covered in episode uh two hundred and one hundred variously, I think. So um people can go uh enjoy those again if they want to hear the story of how the podcast is made But I don't know, five years. That's uh that's a long time. I don't think I thought it would survive this long, or that we'd run out of ideas before this point. How do you feel about it?

Matthew
05:21
Yeah, I mean I've definitely run out of ideas, um, as evidenced by my lack of contribution to any ideas docs we have. Um But uh that's all right. People d seem to like what we're doing nonetheless, they like the old favorites. I like more of the episodes than I dislike. I don't really dislike any of them. Um, you know, I like that people still seem to be discovering it and enjoying it and there seems to be you know, new people occasionally popping up on the Patreon or Discord or whatever. So that's good. Always excites me when someone discovers it and decides to do. the five year realism. That's the best thing that can happen. Like what a a great sign of uh you know that you've made something that is a little bit evergreen which is you know, a key part of it really.

Samuel
06:05
Yeah, for sure. Like I I haven't gone back and listened to the older episodes for a long time. In the first two years of us doing them I listened back to them quite a lot 'cause I was trying to sort of polish them up and you know, sort of understand what we were good at, what we were less good at, and you know, sort of like think of ideas off the back of our discussion that we can sort of pull out into different episodes. But I haven't done that for a for a while now. Um and if I listen back to an episode uh ev every week once I've edited an episode or you've edited an episode, I always do a re-listen just to make sure that I'm happy with it. Like I never I never just abandon an episode. Um I'm ne I never like, there you go, enjoy. As long as it's not it's not my problem anymore, it's yours. I never have that attitude towards it. So that's a good sign. I personally like never run out of ideas, Matthew. So you are sort of hostage to me. kind of coming up with end endless things um to fire your way. How do you feel about that?

Matthew
06:55
Yeah, it's fine. I mean uh yeah I you know I'll I'm turning up the ideas are still good

Samuel
07:02
Well it's funny it's funny because I don't think we have as many magazine ideas left, for example. And so That makes this episode and the one we're about to do on the main feed quite interesting because they are sort of like I feel like we're almost tying a bow on the substrand of episodes started back with game review scores we got wrong, you know? The sort of like print media specific ones, like the interviews one we did, um, the one we did on we did like several on covers and Um we did a b there's basically a bunch of them over the years. Maybe we did one on previews as well. I can't really remember now. Um but it's uh every now and then there'll be like a big mag focused episode, but we don't do those as much anymore because we have kind of exhausted those memories, I think. And so yeah, this year you kind of get the the last bits of uh you know sort of insight on the mag process as we talk about back pages on the main feed. Um but for this one I thought we'd do something a bit Sharper tongued, a bit more appropriate for the um behind the the sort of paywall uh content. So it's fifty truths about games journalism. Now I don't want you thinking that we're taking this so seriously and we're telling you no one else's opinion matters, just ours. This is very much like a preposterous exercise. And in no way do we want to seem like self-righteous. This is not like someone on g on blue sky going Um, I'm gonna tell you everything about games journalism that you wanted to know but people were afraid to tell you. Thread and then you immediately block that person and get on with your life because you're like absolutely fucking not. I want nothing to do with this guy. So That is not the vibe of what we're going for at all. It's a bit sillier than that, with hopefully some, you know, real insight in there as well, Matthew. Would you say that's the tone we'd landed on with this?

Matthew
08:44
Uh yeah, I think people are gonna get a bit more insight from yours. Uh You always say this about the different episodes that we do, but Yeah, no, I th I think this is true. Um, you know, I've read I've read both of the lists of points, so uh I feel like I can say this with some authority that you have a bit more to say on the sort of state of the nation.

Samuel
09:04
Well, it's one of those things where I really um you know, I really believe in it. Like it's it's Uh you know, if I didn't do games media, I'd have no idea what my career path would have been um or where I would have ended up. Like no idea whatsoever. So it was like such a perfect fit for who I was in my, you know, later teenage years and who in my early twenties and then less so throughout my twenties as I got more and more ground down by it. But, you know, it's it it feels like home in some ways. And so I wanna see it do well. I want there to be newer writers. I want people to have interesting perspective on things. I w I don't want them to be ground down by, you know, the sort of like uh practical challenges of making websites or magazines in 2025. Uh you know, I I sort of do believe in it. So I that's why I think deeply about it, because I think that having been on the PR side of the fence and journalism and like flipped back and forth in like the last few years. Um, I think that I just I just got like a really clear idea of what the challenges are and like not necessarily how they're solved but just where we're at, you know? So that's why I think I I think about this more than you. Whereas You haven't worked in journalism for a few years, right? So you're a freelancer. I've no idea how much you think about this stuff at all. Do you do you ever think about it? But no th thing is like you do you know you still write reviews and that sort of thing, but I don't think you're desperate to go back. I think you maybe think you you want to sometimes, but then realize that maybe you're not. I don't really know. That's maybe a bit of a personal question, Matthew, but um anything you want to share there or is is that too personal?

Matthew
10:39
I just don't know what it would be, you know. Yeah The the s the stuff that I like doing is the stuff that you actually don't do if you have any seniority in games media. Yeah, which sucks. So I think I was actually quite lucky in hindsight on RPS. to have a job which actually just let me do lots of writing and work while still being ostensibly in charge of something.

Samuel
11:01
Yeah, that's funny, 'cause that's what my tech radar job was about, but that was obviously about streaming. Um so that was a bit less my sort of sub my specialty area. And also, you know, the be ideals post as well, which I did not like writing. No but I sure did write a lot of Disney Plus uh e comms articles in twenty twenty. Um just one of the many things that gave me psychic damage during COVID um alongside Covid itself and the consequences thereof. Um but on that note, Matthew, it's five years hence, and now we can talk about some things we've learned over the years about working in games journalism. So shall we take it in turns on these? That feels like the right way, doesn't it?

Matthew
11:41
Yeah, sounds good.

Samuel
11:42
Okay, cool. Um so my first one. Um publishers will never give you enough screenshots for a cover feature, but you'll make it work somehow. It's funny because when I was working with John Strike on PC Gamer, I think he would always say to me, Oh, if you want to put over eight pages, the ideal is like twelve to fifteen screenshots, but I would say in the modern age you're lucky if you get six.

Matthew
12:03
Yeah, yeah.

Samuel
12:04
Publishers like do so few screenshots and like the ones that you do see are just like you know, really polished if you think about the different There are some games that have such distinct screenshots that you see them a million times because they've thought really clearly about the composition and presumably they've done some like touching up of it. I'm talking about like When you ever you see a screenshot of GTA 4, it's always one of like a certain batch of GTA 4 screenshots that everyone's seen. And over the years, that has increasingly become the approach where like You will only ever get like 12 to 13 screenshots throughout the marketing campaign of a game. And like, you know, at the end, when the game comes out, you can take your own. Um but uh up until then it's uh it's tough and then you you have to make it work with some combination of like concept art Um which can work quite well when you're doing a cover feature or like a gigantic box out that takes up loads of space but really has nothing to do with the actual game. Any thoughts on that, Matthew?

Matthew
13:01
Yeah, I'd agree with all that. Uh the number of times we spent, you know, unzipping that folder in the moment of truth to see exactly what we had and You know, you get through the four screens and then you're quickly into stuff that looks like concept art and you're like, can we, dare we, put this environmental concept art? of uh just a desert outpost with no people. Can we put that across the spread? Is that a thing that can happen? Um so many times had those discussions. Uh but you know you make it work. you you just have to, you know, work with what you're given. Um Yeah. Yeah. It's always the most stressful time. When you've c especially when you've like committed, you know, and you're like, well this is it. This is the cover sh feature, whatever happens now. And yeah, you just have to you just have to t to play the hand you doubt, I guess.

Samuel
13:53
Yeah, I was a bit closer to the process of how these screenshots actually get taken when I was at Frontier. Um like I would uh have a like a meeting with the the capture artists and brief them on exactly what I wanted, what I wanted the you know, which units I wanted in the screen if it was like an RTS or something, which kind of camera angle I wanted. And you realise just from doing that that it's quite complicated, but then obviously, you know, it also depends on whether the game you're working on. It's like has like a license holder. So um, you know, like Games Workshop for example, would have might have to approve the screenshots if you know, that have been taken or that sort of thing. Or if it's like a game by an indie studio, then they have to approve the screenshots, which is, you know, um likely to be a much faster process. But they might also have their own notes about, oh, there's like a a problem over here with this this thing jutting out. There's this, you know, this asset doesn't quite look right or whatever. So I've bit I've been on the other side of it and I can see why If someone says, Can I have two to three exclusive screenshots, it's actually a fucking nightmare. Like it's not like you have them to hand. You do have to go out and actually like get them made. And then there are people internally who have quality standards about what those should look like. So yeah. Um but By the by, Matthew, what's your first one?

Matthew
15:02
Uh Staff Writer is the best job on a games magazine, closely followed by games editor. I I don't know if you actually agree with this. I think this is true, particularly the staff writer bit. You sort of have zero responsibilities and you get to do loads of writing. You just get to sort of be across that magazine. If you want to and you've got a strong enough voice, it's a real opportunity to sort of uh shape that magazine's tone of voice without having any particular power to decide what that tone of voice is. Um which I guess is a bit of a egotistical way of thinking about it but uh it is true. But I I did also like games editor because dealing with games editors they handle like previews and reviews basically and being in charge of reviews and being able to keep the good release yourself is amazing.

Samuel
15:59
So that's that's why I picked those. The number of people in the world right now who have the t the job title games editor is probably fewer than we had in the Imagine Office circa 2008. You know, which is I think tells its own story about what happened to games journalism, but um you know, it's not a very common job title these days. But I do agree with you. I think that I think the best job in games journalism i over the past like decade or so, and he might disagree with this, but was Christian Donlan's job on Eurogamer. where he was sort of like their in-house writer guy and would you know would write about the games he was given but also the games he was interested in and sort of like, you know, people knew his voice and celebrated his voice. and he was writing on a great website and it f it seemed like a pretty great gig to me. So and that was a staff writer gig. So I I kind of agree that If you can wrangle it so you all you have to do is write, and you know, you are sort of like you are responsible for the tone of the thing people are reading to some extent. Yeah, it's much better than being told your mag sales are sliding, what like oh the colour green doesn't work on the on uh on magazines it doesn't sell and all this kind of nonsense. Um Starfighter insulates you from any of that.

Matthew
17:13
I never once as staff writer looked at everyone else on the mag and thought, oh, I could cost all these people their jobs if I make a really bad call. Um, because that just couldn't happen. But when your editor it is I don't know if that w actually is true and it's a really but uh I definitely felt that way. Always. Yeah. Oh well, this is just gonna be it for these people 'cause I can't get people to buy a copy of a magazine with fucking Darth Vader on the cover.

Samuel
17:41
Yeah, highly relatable. Um the games editor thing's definitely true as well because I you know, we had both John Denton and Matt Hadrahan on this year who who both worked on the same magazine at the same time. And it was quite clear that being the features editor of Games TM was like so onerous on Matt Handrahan that he didn't really have time to play games during work hours. Whereas being games editor on Games TM uh John definitely worked hard but like you could immerse yourself in like playing games and understanding games. In a way you just couldn't the features editor is so fucking hard. I did that on Sypher Now and it was basically like Oh, we might need to ask you what the cover feature is gonna be this month because um, you know, i the feature section is everything in this magazine. And it's like, well fuck that. That's I'm not if you're not even deputy if you're not if you're not even deputy editor and you're being asked to like for that level of responsibility, it's like the cover lines are dependent on you. It's like I'm I'm afraid you're gonna have to get fucked. That's rubbish. How dare you, frankly. Um that's a good one, Matthew. I like that. Um okay, uh my number two, uh shorter sentences are always better. Uh so I this this doesn't apply if you have like, let's say, forty sentences that are five to seven words in a row. That's like bad writing. Then you've written a children's book. Exactly. Ul ultimately you want a a mix of sentence structures to to have a kind of like, you know, variety to offer a variety in a in the reading experience when someone's actually like reading your work. So that's that is important. But I say this because when I started writing about games, or writing in general, my sentences are really fucking long because I think I thought that made me clever somehow. Um but then it took working on PC Gamer and Tony Ellis to say no shorter sentences are always better if you're in doubt. And it's a good it's a good way to think about your writing because it just encourages you to be concise. And that really is um that really is the most important thing. I don't know if you agree with this, Matthew.

Matthew
19:36
Yeah, I mean I mean it's it's uh uh a commonly said and held, you know, writing advice. Um And if you've ever read any of my tweets or blue sky things, uh you'll see that I like to make the most of that character count and um prone to some incredibly overlong sentences with a thousand different sort of clauses going on. Uh yeah, I you know, differ different strokes for different folks. I definitely think you most writers, certainly most, you know, writers that I worked with and just following their work over the years, they start off a lot more hectic than they end up whether that's just through loads of production editors, you know, gradually pounding that into their heads or just, you know, your taste matures. uh into a slightly more readable style. I don't know. But uh yeah, yeah it's it's not not a wild a wild idea for sure.

Samuel
20:37
Yeah, that's more just advice for good ro advice for writing in general. Just don't overcomplicate the reading experience and you know, you'll probably you'll probably be okay. Um certainly the best advice I ever got. What's your next one Matthew?

Matthew
20:49
Uh explaining why something is good is harder than explaining why it is bad. I mean correct.

Samuel
20:55
Well I mean what what is this podcast if not an attempt to do the former Yeah.

Matthew
21:00
Again, yeah, not not a Hugely deep observation, uh, but you know, when you're reviewing games, I just remembered like the the reviews that I remembered growing up were uh mostly the kickings of just someone having a wild time of just ripping something a new one. Um, you know, that's quite a key part of, you know, N sixty four and N G C and they had some very funny writers on there and You know, it's why that uh Steve Hoggerty uh Sims DLC thing does the rounds every six months. Uh but You know, maybe just through the fact that, you know, I get to review a lot of Nintendo games which tend to be very good and you know I like reading you know, r reviews of good games. Uh it's it's I think it's it's very difficult to to or it's harder anyway, to to really pin down and id identify what makes something work and that's often the thing that like I feel like the most work happens with like new writers and staff writers on magazines is it's kind of working out that process and and and getting there to you know really be able to sort of surgically identify why you liked a thing. Um And yeah, that's all there is to it really.

Samuel
22:22
Yeah, I agree. I I don't think I got good at this until like the very my very last days on PC Gamer really. I think it was for years I was sort of like trying to figure out what is my exact perspective on games. And I think I'm very confident in that these days. But took many years to work it out. I definitely had my sort of like corners of criticism where I was like, this is what I like about this thing. Like I could say, you know, I I think I could describe the feel of bayonetic combat quite well and why it works and the idea of like um you sort of like imagining something that your buttons that you know your button presses then put on the screen. I think that sort of like discussion of game on a m games on a mechanical level, I could do quite well. But like bigger narratives and things like that and using games to sort of build those. That's something I think we do quite well on this podcast, for example, you know?

Matthew
23:11
Yeah, weirdly a lot of m the th the kind of cult favorite games or the heart picks, I guess, that I've carried forwards from those magazine days. They happened to be the games where I felt like I did have a line on them or I did understand them or I kind of pinned down. And I don't know if I just like them because I like talking about them and feel like I can talk about them or you know, i if it's just coincidence that that i it was that batch of games. But y you definitely know there are some reviews you feel like, oh yeah, I already nailed that, you know, and I've been repeating those talking points from those reviews twenty years later on this podcast just because I've you know I'm so confident in in the in the take. Um where there's other games which I loved and I gave great reviews to, you know, good you know, gave them good reviews, but I don't necessarily you know, I I reread them and I'm like, I don't know if I really nailed that 'cause I don't really remember the points I was making.

Samuel
24:13
But Yeah, I think um this made me think a bit about how whenever I'd review uh cinematic games back in the Xbox era, I would I would like be really fixated on the idea of what they mean for storytelling in video games and how it's being pushed forward and how it's like Right. And and I don't think I'd even bother with that kind of criticism these days. Like if I was reviewing Mass Effect 2, I think my perspective on it would be completely different to what it was in two thousand nine when I played it and wrote about it. I think it would be it would be much more uh fixated on uh the idea of what the uh the sort of permutations do do well and less well, and whether the combat is up to it and, you know, like do you do the sort of like truncated planets give you enough of a feel of like leaping across the galaxy? Those are the things that I think I'd be interested in. talking about if I was replaying Mass Effect 2, but at the time I was fixated on the fact that I think this is better than any TV show I saw this year. And like that's the sort of Right. And I think that's just your perspective evolving. But also just finding deeper things to say about, you know, things that are more rudimentary than storytelling, which is quite easy to comment on, but it's a lot harder to talk about why. Shooting is good or bad, you know? So yeah. Um yeah, it's a good point, Matthew. I like that. Okay. Um writing magazine captions is hell on earth for every single writer you can think of. So I I mean the thing about magazine captions is they've got to be the among the most read words in a magazine, right? Because they're normally boldered out. You know, they're next to the images which draw your eye more than the body text does. And like I I certainly read them more than I read Paul quotes in a piece, for example, but it represents my the the worst writing I ever did by far. Um what do you think of this one?

Matthew
25:59
I don't know if it was out and out my w worse writing. I can think of regular things I had to do which like anything in the Pokemon section of Endgamer, which is just absolutely worthless, uh if you go back to it. I think the the problem with captions is I remember some really funny captions from reading magazines growing up, and so every individual caption is an opportunity to contribute to the art form that is captions, but I inevitably didn't so I'd end up feeling quite frustrated. You know, everyone like maybe like one in fifty captions is like a good joke, and that was a pretty good hit rate. Yeah. Yeah, I tell you the captions I can never ever work out the right tone of voice for is Edge magazine. Doing them now. I just never know what to to write in those captions. Like whether they need to be thoughtful or like sooty sounding joke or I don't know. It's yeah, it's a tricky one.

Samuel
26:58
Yeah, it's funny because if I was sort I think I would describe the ideal edge caption as a As a bon mot, as they say back here. Just named after Tony. Yes, Mott with two T's actually in that case. Bon Mott That's the dumbest joke just being uttered on this podcast. Now that's a joke I'd put in an end game again. That's actually that's pretty good. Um But it's that sort of thing where it's witty and insightful but it doesn't have the actually I can't remember, does it end with a full stop or not an edge caption? Or does it like just go off? Oh well I I end them with a full stop. But Well they must be maybe I'm thinking of older. I can't remember without having it to hand, but uh yes. Um yeah I can see the challenge there. Um also just like I imagine you would wrestle a lot with what is an acceptable edge joke, you know? I could see you really that really giving you some grief.

Matthew
27:49
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think they just like a good joke. I think we I think it's quite easy to overthink Edge, to be honest. Uh I still do it always is on. Like a good joke is a good joke and they'd like a Gina. There are good jokes in Edge all the time. Um yeah, for sure.

Samuel
28:05
I mean I haven't written for Edge, but uh I did get special thanks in two issues for the covers I worked on for Indian Doom, so Um that's almost as as good as writing for Edge. Okay, Matthew, what's your next one?

Matthew
28:17
It's a bummer that the more expertise you get, uh the further you seem to move away from the writing. Which I guess is true of most jobs where you know, i it's just the shift into management sucks, but in games it's particularly sad because there's lots of people still involved in games who I read growing up and On the occasion that they do get to do some writing, it's great, you know, and it it just flows so well and they have this this Yeah, huge kind of treasure trove of stuff to dip into. I'm thinking of people like Dan Dawkins, for example, on Games Radar, you know, like when he gets to write about Metal Gear, I love reading that shit. Um, but he also has to manage this vast empire now and so yeah that doesn't happen as much. Um and it just yeah it just It makes me sad. I feel like you feel it more in games than you would in other industries, maybe.

Samuel
29:11
Yeah, well I think it's just that it's for much harder to Have a career just being a reviewer, for example. Whereas in film or TV there are people I mean a a decreasing number of people But someone like AA Dowd, for example, still reviews films, you know? Um he just reviews some for IGN now rather than like the A V Club. And so, you know, those those kind of like Jobs seem to have persisted in film and TV a little bit more than they have in games. Whereas games I can only really think of like people who have stayed in these kinds of positions would be like Andy Kelly, for example, managed to have these kinds of stay at a staff writer style role for basically his whole career in media before he moved into PR. Um and then like I was saying, Chris Donlin kind of did something similar on Eurogamer, but Yeah, but Robert Perchy's a little bit actually on um on Eurogamer.

Matthew
30:00
Or being like i if you if you are one of the very rare like editors of a game section of a newspaper where it's predominantly you you know, like Kether and Keith, uh the Guardian um get to do loads of great games writing and it's some of my favorite stuff. Just because they bring, you know, twenty years plus to it, so Yeah, but um I do agree.

Samuel
30:22
There's sort of uh yeah, definitely you bank more and more knowledge and then you know, by the time I came back to writing about games mags in uh writing about games in twenty twelve, uh it was just um I'd been out of it for quite a long time and felt like I'd missed out on some some good years of actually like covering the covering the things and so Yeah, I do always feel like there's some there's some missing years there, so I totally get that, Matthew. Okay, my next one. Semicolons always give away an amateur writer. And you may not agree with this, Matthew, but but I think that it's just one of those little bits of punctuation flair that people love to chuck in to try and seem like they're you know, a smart writer person when really it sort of gives away that they're a little bit a little bit insecure, a little bit unsure, a little bit like they don't understand how commas work, that kind of thing.

Matthew
31:10
But are are you saying that an amateur writer will always trip up on a semicolon, or that the simple presence of a semi semicolon uh denotes an amateur writer. 'Cause listen, I like a semicolon.

Samuel
31:23
Uh I think the key distinction is you said a semicolon. I I say if you see Like two or more in a like eight hundred word piece, then I would say that gives away an amateur writer. I think

Matthew
31:35
The semiconal I always think of as uh Grammar's handbrake turn. That's a great way of putting it. Going in one direction. Now we're going in that direction. I love it.

Samuel
31:44
The Yeah, that is good. I mean, I I'd I'm not saying like I'd never use it, I definitely have, but it's when people are using them like they are commas. Or like they are colons. Like if they're using them where either either of those usually it's one of those things that should be there, you know.

Matthew
31:59
You get a feeling in your gut where you're like, you know what? I think we're talking semicolon time here. It's a bit like that. It's like it's sort of

Samuel
32:10
Writing's version of shooting from the hip using a semicolon, do you know what I mean?

Matthew
32:14
It's very much uh Luke Skywalker using the force to hit the exhaust port or whatever it is on a Death Star. It's like You just know when it's right, you know?

Samuel
32:24
Yeah, exactly. That's that's funny. Um but yeah, that's that's more just like a tip for people who are sort of newer to writing really, it's just If you're using loads of the damn things, just ask if you should be using a like a comma or a colon instead. Because the answer's probably yes, you know. Um what's what's your next one?

Matthew
32:42
You will get sick of the first hour of every game that you cover multiple times at preview and review events. This comes about this comes up a lot in The Office, where there are certain games where The idea of replaying them, you're just so turned off because you played the opening section to it multiple times before it was even released. And the idea of doing it. I think the key one for this for me is uh Phantom Pain.

Samuel
33:08
Oh god. That first hour I wouldn't want to do over and over again.

Matthew
33:12
That first hour I just can't do it because I did it a preview, I did it a review, and then I did it for my own copy when I got that and now any replay, you know, I'm I'm on my fourth replay of the first hour, but it's only my second replay of the game all the way through and Um yeah, it's just a a weird little thing. I think every games journal has one or two games where they're like The opening to this is just death to me now. Mary Galaxy 1, that's another one.

Samuel
33:41
Yeah, I I th I think that the sort of strongest example of this for me, what would it be actually? I might actually need like a moment to think of what this this might be, but I can definitely tell you games where I've played the first hour so many times that I can't really imagine having to do it again. And uh one of those is um Hitman 2016, like the tutorial on that boat. Oh yeah. I reckon I've played that boat more than any other Hitman level. And I've played those levels like a lot. Like I've played that game for more than a hundred hours. But that boat, because it was like in the beta, that boat, I think I just did that in the beta about I think I did it about ten times trying to do everything when the beta was going. Then I had to play it again when the game actually came out. Then I had to play it again when I played it on a different format the next time I played it. And then You know, I think I might have had another round at it when my stats were reset in the Epic Games version after moving over to there. Like I just I definitely played it again with a terrible frame rate on Switch 2. And it's just like The joy of Paris will never dissipate because it's such a good level, but that boat level is very much a tutorial level, it's very much functional. And like the idea of like Doing that again. No, definitely not. But then again, I I do feel the the last bit of sapienza does also make me feel this way. Like I don't yeah, I don't want to go in that fucking And I don't want to hear those um NPCs outside um that mansion again either in Sapienza Matthew. So uh what is it the the woman shouts um from the window? It's like it's more than a lot of things. Roger, Roger, something like that. That's it. Yeah, you're right. It's something like that. Yeah. So yeah, I've definitely had this a few times. Some other games I just can't play the opening off again. Final Fantasy IX. Like it's actually like taboo with my partner to bring up the Final Fantasy IX intro because she's like, if you're not gonna play it, past the village with the little evil V V lads. then I don't want to hear about it again. I literally never you cannot talk about this anymore. So that's a way in which it's done damage to me. Then I I've done damage to someone else. So yes, Matthew, um just some examples there. But uh yeah. fun times. Um I do like that one. Okay. Uh having a strong work ethic is a hundred times more important than games journalism than having a degree. This is a Samuel Roberts classic this one. No chip on the shoulder here. Well no, I don't have a problem with people going out and, you know, uh bringing in education into their work. It's a it's you know, I believe in different perspectives and that's certainly you're not always gonna get good perspectives on games from working in one stop in Hampshire, okay? Like I get that that is a limited cultural perspective in itself. But um I do think that to survive in games journalism just requires you to have this a fundamental Very powerful work ethic, one that may seem unreasonable to you when you're looking back on your career in journalism, which it does at times to be honest. Like um I just don't think I could work as hard again as I did from like two thousand seven to well, twenty twenty one to be honest. It's pretty relentless that whole time. I just don't I just can't do anymore. But like it's To actually even like the the j games journalists you might hate, like people who write really baity headlines. You know, people who just write list features or SEO um articles on GTA 6 or whatever, people whose work you might not even really engage with or respect. Like just to to actually do the job requires so much more effort than like mental effort than um like a normal job would. It just takes a lot out of you and I definitely re-remembered that this year going back to Games Journalism Matthew. You have a degree and I'm definitely not diminishing that um the value that uh that has given you, but what do you think of the Of work ethic versus like having some kind of education like that.

Matthew
37:33
In print just to get it done and to stay sane and t just be able to get through those days. Yeah, definitely work ethic was a a huge part of it and you're right, it's I mean the the tragedy of this is it will yeah, it'll work you really hard. you know, even if the output isn't particularly great, you know, just th there's n there's no real way of of phoning it in, I don't think. Um Yeah. Yeah, it's it's t yeah, it is it is t it is tough though. And it it doesn't go away. And I feel like you always, you know, have an idea of there's sort of something to prove and you know, even with this podcast I think it's the same bit of my brain that did all that demented work for Endgamer, it's like the same bit of the brain which thinks it's okay to play you know, a hundred and fifty hours of games for like a two hour episode. Like it just doesn't make any sense. We just need to do less of that next year. Like you did we need to start I know, I know. I mean it's Yeah, I mean this upcoming Metroid episode I've literally replayed and finished every Metroid game. Yeah. It should be comprehensive.

Samuel
38:42
It will be, but I will I will also ask, with Metroid Prime 4 coming out In a parallel universe with no podcasts, is there a chance you would have played quite a lot of these games again anyway?

Matthew
38:51
I probably would have played a couple of them. Yeah, I would have played the the best of them. But I f I found it interesting playing all of them and actually playing them in together, you know, being able to see kind of connective tissue and how how they sort of evolve, you know, that I I have enjoyed that. Don't get me wrong, I'm not moaning about it. It was a fun exercise and I did it to myself. So

Samuel
39:11
Well I would have been up for doing another two giant men play a Metroid game episode. Um but it's just to get a sort of third episode out of the uh that effort. But that's kind of why I took out the best games of different series episodes as a format really. The Metroid one we're doing in December is actually a a bit of a late return to something that we've sort of discontinued. Um because it is more efficient to do the two giant men play um one game and talk about that. Like I kinda wish we'd just done an episode on God of War 3 instead of that whole series, you know, like that might have been a really fun, yeah. Fun one to do. So, you know, um enjoy enjoy this Metroid one because probably not going to do a series one like that again, I don't think. Just to stop Matthew from going completely insane. Um there's always Fire Emblem 2026. That's true. What's your next one, Matthew?

Matthew
39:59
You work with people whose superpower is to boil things down to their core essence and they will do the same to you. Expect to become a caricature in seconds. Um this is just I mean this is really the the only truth this of this is that uh uh i working with Tim Weaver all those years and and seeing him yeah boil down very complex personalities to just like one running gag in the meet the team page. Um You just have to be prepared for it. W I was when I was writing some of these truths, I felt like I was giving advice that no one ever needs because they're never gonna have to have these jobs. Yeah. This culture doesn't exist anymore, so I'm like, well this is gonna happen, except it won't because no one's gonna do it. Uh which is like the depressing undercurrent of it. But um I guess uh if I imagine this is Is forty year old Matthew uh talking to twenty one year old Matthew, I would say, yes, that uh that that humor you loved so much in the magazine, like you're going to be part of that and um you're just gonna have to like deal with that.

Samuel
41:07
This is like someone explaining to you. how to become how to operate best when you're a town crier and you're like, well there is no there is no town crier job I can go and do. So It's not particularly helpful, so uh yeah. This is why it's perfect paywall for Oh exactly, because it's for no one. It's for no one at all, Matthew. Um, okay. Um taking a good in the Patreon comments if this was for you. Taking a good screenshot of a first person shooter is basically impossible. Um I stand by this one. Like it's no matter what you do, whether you're firing a gun, like what the visual effects won't look right in screenshot form, whether you're being shot at and there are sprays of blood, there'll be something wrong with the visual artifacts of the blood. And you just won't and you'll never get a good angle on the thing you're shooting at because unless you put it on like easy mode or like you're taking no damage at all. Because, you know, that's just not what Uh it's just very, very hard to do. So I feel like I've fucked this up so many times where when we have the old we had like some kind of digital foundry like technology to screen grab PS3 games. And it was it was like they're much crisper than the ones we used to have. We used to have this really crap old system for the PS2 games. So you got this nice system for the PS3. And even though like plugging it in to work with the PS3, it seemed to not work for like three hours at a time and then eventually like actually work properly. I feel like I'd take forty dark screenshots, send them to my um my desktop, then look at them all, realize how dark they were and go Oh, I I've really fucked this, then go back and just pick the l one level that's got sunshine. Take four to four to five good screenshots there and call it a day, basically. Like and I feel like that's ha always how I did a first person game. Do you have any thoughts on this?

Matthew
42:52
Yeah, I mean I would extend this to m to most video games to be honest. When I screenshotted games, I realized that There are so many things, tricks happening in the game to pull you into it and to make you think you're having a wild time. And then when you see a still of it, it looks so fucking boring. And you think, wow, I was impressed by that. That's nothing going on there. But in your head, you know, everything's exploding. The bananas are making crazy noises. I remember I say bananas because I was thinking of Donkey Kong Country Returns. specifically that game was such a fucking nightmare to get good screens off because it always just looks like a monkey s like standing in a jungle. It just doesn't look like anything that game. Uh yeah, nightmare. I mean the screenshots you see in a magazine are the best ten screenshots of like 500 screenshots Yeah. Uh and and yet we have the audacity to complain about the screenshots we're supplied in point number one of this list.

Samuel
43:50
Well well yeah, that is the thing. Like um I mean there are definitely like reviews I did where all the screenshots are terrible. Like when I reviewed the darkness on p on PS3, I remember the art editor complaining that all the screenshots I submitted to him were like Very hard to see what's going on. I was like, man, that's just what that game looks like, I'm afraid. Like it's you are always it's always nighttime. The only lit up space is the subway um that sort of like links all the other levels. There's no bright locations in this game, but when you look at the actual review it's just like these big walls of black screen where you just can't see anything except the vague outline of a little goblin or something. And it's like It's tough. Um yeah, I definitely never got good at this. Um I said the photo modes exist now, so you can at least, you know, fake some nice screenshots.

Matthew
44:36
Yeah, that's true.

Samuel
44:37
What's the next one, Matthew?

Matthew
44:39
Uh you must learn the keyboard shortcut for the accented E in Pokemon, or you'll be forced to copy and paste it from another document every time you need it. Uh that's incredibly specific, but it's one of my lasting memories of working in Nintendo is never knowing how to make that E happen. And just having like an open document that I could grab it from.

Samuel
45:00
Not a good way to work. Oh dear. That has that's prompted a memory, not related to Pokemon, but a similar kind of like uh if you just do it wrong once the effect the consequences it can have. So when I worked on PC Gamer, I worked with this guy called Joe Donnelly and he was um he He created the tag for the game Fallout 76 before it came out, and by tag I mean every time you write an article about that in the back end of the website You enter this little tag um and it comes up and it gr it means that when people search for PC Gamer Fall out seventy six you get all of the articles about that one game in the same place. And you couldn't change the tags once you did them. So if you did them you were stuck with them. Or you had to create a new one, go back and re-tag all the old articles. And Joe, I remember, much to the chagrin of um uh news editor Andy Chalk. Um did it as Fallout Colon seventy-six and it was wrong in that CMS for so long and then it just drove Andy completely spare. And I think like even up until a few years ago he would still t uh tweet at Joe about um the Fallout Colon seventy-six thing. And it just really makes me laugh because it is obvious it's such a small error But it's the idea that that error gradually but grows and grows and grows each time someone has to do it and each time it's wrong. Very funny.

Matthew
46:14
So uh Of course if uh Joe had been an an amateur writer it would have been fallout semicolon seventy six.

Samuel
46:21
Very good, Matthew. There you go. There's one of my bomb mots for you. Bon mot with mot with two T's there. Um So dumb. The best developer interviews are always with people who have nothing to sell. Before I go off here, Matthew, do you agree with this?

Matthew
46:37
Yes. Yes, in that they can be completely o they can just be their authentic selves, right?

Samuel
46:43
If they are talking about a game where there's no consequence to, you know, whether it succeeds or fails because it's already come out, it's already released, it's already been a success or it's in the it's in the rear view mirror. I think that people can just be a m lot more relaxed about it. Um on the PR side I Done a few uh Bethesda and Machine Games interviews recently where that was the case because the games had been on gone and the the games that were being discussed and It just made for some really good interviews. If you've got this month's Edge uh issue of Edge actually, um you'll find the machine games um interview I I was there for um quite recently and uh You get some really good insights. I always found that to be true when I was working in games journalism and I would interview someone like Andy Gavin from Naughty Dog, and he doesn't work in Naughty Dog anymore, so he can be really honest about what it was like basically being like kids um running that studio and creating Jack and Daxter and other characters that you dislike Matthew and so yeah it's um So I I just think that's uh I I think that is true just because you all you always catch developers in the most relaxed mood where they don't have to sell something.

Matthew
47:46
But um yeah. I'd agree with that.

Samuel
47:48
All right, cool. We'll see next one, Matthew.

Matthew
47:50
Video and written reviews are totally different art forms, don't try and turn one into another. This and there's there's two directions of this. One, it really bugs me when A lot of video reviews are just the written review read out by often not the writer. Um so it's not even their own voice, it's someone else. speaking a first person opinion as their own, which is bonkers to me. But also I I just think that, you know, the way that you show information and what you can show in the video, the fact that it accompanies audio and visuals allows you to to sh shape the piece in some really interesting ways. So it really bugs me that a lot of people don't choose to do that. They just set capture to the review they're going to run on the website. The other flip side is it used to really drive me up the wall when I joined RPS and I would say there was quite a lot of anti-video sentiment from their quite like old man audience. And this request of like, oh just give me a transcript of the video and I'll just read that. And you're like, well, then you're removing, you know, the interplay with the visuals, which I've worked quite hard on. And that is equally shit, you know, that that isn't a good idea. We never did that, thankfully. But yeah, I just think there's a lot of sloppiness. I c I came to really respect people who you know, understand what is specific about video and really make those videos seeing and uh I don't think there's like a huge amount a huge amount of it around, you know, so many Even video assists are really just a podcast sets some capture which doesn't reflect anything that's being said and I don't know. I just uh Just think it's lazy.

Samuel
49:29
Yeah, it's funny because I I got quite into again recently that a channel called um Some Call Me Johnny on YouTube where it's this guy who's quite interested in PS2. and like um Mega Drive era games and then games that are connected to those and he'll just do one game and then talk about it. But his actual sort of like video content is very well tailored to You know, he takes his original capture, he appears on camera as well, and he cut it cuts between it. And it's much more interesting to me than, yeah, just having an essay read out over some footage and much more engaging. And I agree, I don't I don't think I could do this well, to be honest. I think I would um probably struggle with it, but um you are much more of an authority on this than me, Matthew.

Matthew
50:09
So uh Well, I that's saying I I didn't make enough of success of it that I Can still do it as a job. So maybe don't listen to me on the subject of videos.

Samuel
50:18
Well, that's because the event industry and games went to shit. Nothing to do with you, is it? That's all to do with COVID-19. And the fact the failure to bounce back from said pandemic. Okay, um, next up then is uh where is it? Here we go. Review scores are good. Very simple one, but I saw some discussion of this. Someone used the Arc Raiders reviewed by Eurogamer that was two out of five to say review score. This is why review scores fail! Because some you know, big lot of bullshit they said after that. Um and I I didn't disag didn't agree with. Um but it was basically like I think the idea that Even if you, you know, are sort of pro games media and games media saying things and think when people complain about review scores, they're people who just hate games media anyway and want to complain about them. Um, you know, it's just th uh the idea that somehow I don't know, you should put the audience's potential to deliberately misconstrue what a score represents like before any other consideration and I just don't agree with that. Like a number is a fun talking point. Um it's like a a full stop on a piece of writing. And I'm not saying that like, you know, great criticism of a game, you know, sort of like needs a review score. We don't give review scores on on this podcast, for example. But I don't know, man. I love review scores. I love Rena Ba Rina Bam talking about them. I like, you know, seeing how things pan out on Metacritic and all that stuff. It's just part of the I don't know, it just adds a a bit of a sporting element to the whole thing. Um, and I think people who want to get rid of them are just just miserable bastards, really. Um what do you think?

Matthew
51:51
Yeah Yeah, I mean uh they're just too drilled into my head from, you know, the the reviews that I grew up reading. I imagine it's a generation of younger writers and and, you know, younger readers who you know, can read lots of criticism that doesn't have a review score or or isn't even a traditional review and so, you know, that stuff functions fine without it. But um I I I cer you know I I I don't object to their not being a review review score, but the idea of like, you know, there sh that it shouldn't exist outright is is uh I mean that's a that's a mute for me on Blue Sky.

Samuel
52:32
Yeah, and it's sort of like I don't know, uh having that review score enabled that Arc Raiders review to and the the point it made to travel much further than it would have done without the score. So I don't know. I feel like that is also a good argument for it. If it's like if it's what you need to Trojan horse your way into a conversation, so be it really. Okay, good stuff, Matthew. What's the next one?

Matthew
52:53
Uh another video point. Working in video completely breaks how you play video games. Again, this is aimed specifically at me and no one else. Um I'll never look at save files the same way again. Whenever I played games I even though I don't work in video anymore and I don't make videos about games anymore, I am constantly thinking about If I had to get to this moment again, how would I do it? And whenever I save a game or I make a um like a rest point or whatever they call it on Switch Online, you know, on that kind of emulation level, you can make an artificial save point. I always think, oh, what mess if I need to get back to this boss to take some video of it? Even though I don't work in video and I won't have to do that. Um it's just absolutely broken my brain. Uh th the habit I got out of when I was on RPS I used to play a lot of games without sound. I i in case I needed to sort of record from them and I didn't I didn't ever want music in them, I just wanted sound effects for the for the edit. Um so I played all these games in this like weird, sort of fucked up sort of void where they didn't have all their awesome music, which uh th that I don't do anymore. But the save things. Just playing some um Metroid Fusion on GBA and I was like, oh, don't wanna lose. You know, don't want to lose my save file before the Ridley fight, might need that, which is just madness.

Samuel
54:20
Yeah, exactly. It's uh Well yeah, that's I guess like one way in which working video specifically has broken your brain. I don't know if I was very good at ever really saving uh keeping save points for screenshot taking because I resented the process so much that I just didn't even have them really to hand. Um which is Probably bad.

Matthew
54:38
Any game which gives you like a hundred save files, those are brilliant. You know, like anyone if you can just save for days, that's amazing. If it's like 10 or even 20, that's where you're like, oh you motherfucker like d dare I save over this or am I gonna need this particular moment or like when did I last save? Oh it was an hour ago could I feasibly get back here if I needed to capture this? Um my s save files for uh Final Fantasy VII Rebirth were so precarious, you know, like I was I was trying it 'cause that's a big old game and it's quite easy to you know, be hours away from the thing that you actually want to capture in that game. So yeah, that was the last game I did a proper like save file number on them. Those are pristine those save files

Samuel
55:24
You got a save file right before that bullshit bit in Shinra Mansion. Um which you consider the highlight of the game, Matthew. But um no it's uh yeah, I I think that makes sense. Um this reminds me that when I was Working on the game Deliver Us Mars at Frontier. Um in Unreal Engine, like the uh the sort of like dev console, you could jump between different bits of different levels. And it's a thing that like the game the game like lets you choose which chapter you go to but doesn't choose those. And I always wonder if you give the bills to journalists, can you like also tell them how to turn that stuff on? Like can you give them a bill that lets them do that so they can go dream. Yeah, you they should just drop into like two thirds through a level and take a screenshot of this nice spaceship or whatever. Like that's um yeah, 'cause that sort of thing was essential, you know.

Matthew
56:07
I think they left the debug controls in for the original Assassin's Creed on 360. They did. And Xbox World put a horse on top of a church. And took a screenshot of it and were debating whether they were gonna put this screenshot out to like fuck with people.

Samuel
56:30
uh Altaya would start flying and you could then like fly him over the map. And all it highlighted to me was they needed to put this development function in here because it's a whole game of just going back and forth. forth between places and doing the same thing. And so with no like stimulating content in between or like any variety. And so I think it all I think all that did was highlight that the game wasn't very good. So yeah, like it's I I did like them leaving that in because it felt it means the experience doesn't feel like the finished thing. It feels unvarnished in a way. And um Yeah, that is funny though. I'm sure Ubisoft wouldn't have been happy if that screenshot had made it into Xbox World, but alas. Um, okay Matthew. Games journalism should always have the capacity to be funny, even if the audience is too thick to engage with it. Ye Um if you make any jokes on a game's website now, you'll get thicko's on Twitter. Particularly Twitter, just going, Oh, I don't get this, or who the fuck do you think you are making a joke? Like that people like that basically. And um I think you have to shun those people, consider them dunderheads, and still make your jokes. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
57:28
I mean I love jokes. Um not always good at making them. Um but I'll try my best and uh I aspire to being uh you know a professional joke man.

Samuel
57:41
What's your next one?

Matthew
57:42
Never take an appointment on the public show floor of Gamescom. Words to live by. Or if you do, it has to be the first day when the public isn't allowed in. Even then though. Even then it's got like a hint of like the pig it's gonna become. Yeah, it does. That thing is how Like you may as well just factor in like an hour to get there and an hour to get back. You can kiss all the other adjoining appointments goodbye. Just hell on earth. And it's so stressful just trying to push through there and realizing you've made a terrible mistake. I think a mistake everyone makes once and then never again. The first year I went to Gamescom, I discovered it in the worst way 'cause I got stuck behind a robot that was walking down the hall and everyone was staying out the no one wanted to get in the way of this robot and being like, I'm gonna miss my appointment because everyone's gawking at this robot. I just couldn't believe it. It was such a stupid thing to happen.

Samuel
58:34
Oh man, like the one way system they created in the halls last year. I mean, it was just an absolute fucking nightmare. Like it's uh thing is, right, like I I opted out of like going to a a place in one hall where Suda 51 and Shinji Mikami were like signing shit for the um Shadows of the Damned remaster they did uh last year. Because it just wasn't worth it. I was like, it would be awesome to meet those two guys. I've never met them. I've never interviewed them. It would be awesome to say hello to them. And yet I would still rather just get the fuck out of here and go back to my hotel. Like it's g or or just go hide in hide in one of our booths, which is what I did. But you're right, like it's I always felt like I was trapped by people who did that. Like You know, you kinda know it you know it's shit to give me an appointment like this. I know it's your job to do so, but why don't you have a bit of the business center? You know, if you're a major publisher, you should be doing that. But the worst thing would be even on like you say, like on the the days when it's meant to be quiet at Gamescom, you'd get these guys who are allegedly journalists, right? But look 14 and come to the thing in football shirts and like carry giant backpacks and they're carrying merch around. You know, so like sorry, if these look like kids that should be being wedgied or given wet willies in a playground, they shouldn't be here as journalists? Like should why have they got accreditation? So that's another problem I have is like that would happen at E3 as well. Where you're like, that is a 15-year-old boy carrying like a giant fucking persona bag on his like on his back. Get him the fuck out of here. He's not a real journalist. Like I I felt very strongly about that. So yeah It's also just a- I refuse to believe that that robot was a journalist. Fair enough, Matthew. Okay, next one then. Um if you work for a long-running games media brand, no matter what you do, some grumpy fuck readers or former editors will always say it used to be better. Um the way I said grumpy fuck there was a bit strange, but um that's because I f I just forgot how I structured that sentence, but yes. Um yeah, so This happened a lot in the early days of PC Gamer where like some former writers would just kick PC Gamer or like hate on an article or be like, I I can't believe PC Gamer has stooped to this low. There is one YouTuber who I will not name because it's not worth it. Um that's what I'll say about that, um, who would rag on PC Gamer constantly and made such a point of being like This is an old media institution that is out of touch and like basically bigging himself up. And I was just like, absolutely rancid motherfuckers. I would never do that about any brand I worked on. But um that's just because I've got very um very firm rules on what you do and don't say about other people on the internet. Because I think these things can come back and bite you in the ass, Matthew. But PC Gamer definitely s is around long enough that people had their own idea of what it was and any little infraction they'd jump on and be like, oh, it's the end of days. And they do it in the Eurogamer comments now as well. And it's just like, just shut the fuck up, you know, it's hard doing this job. Uh any thoughts on this?

Matthew
01:01:22
Yeah, um when I inherited Official Xbox magazine, we also inherited Official Xbox magazine US, which was just the localized version of the UK. Obviously they'd let all the US stuff go. You know, they'd been r made redundant, you know, years earlier when they shut that mag. But trying to do any kind of business with the US Xbox magazine when you had former members of staff being out there telling people that it it didn't exist or it was closed. Or you know, just counter to the truth of this thing or or That that was always frustrating. I can understand that they didn't like it. I can understand that they were peeved because of what Future did to them. But I think I would always understand that Well someone else like me is now trying to make this thing work and do I really want to take a big old shit on them every time? Probably not. So yeah, there's a couple of people out there. It's like It's got zero time for them because they were so shitty around the subject of OXMUS.

Samuel
01:02:21
But Yeah, same. And I can hold a grudge for a long time.

Matthew
01:02:25
I mean they'll never ever appear on this podcast. podcast as a guest, so you can start like crossing the good people often. Oh dear, that's like anyone who hasn't been on this is potentially a bastard. If you're over the word count, turn your most extraneous paragraph into a box out. Uh I love that. Yeah, I think this is true. Uh this happens all the time with Edge because I always forget there's box outs and then I go, Wow, I'm a hundred words over over the limit. Uh I need a hundred word box out Let's do a little cut here, put a little intro on it, a little joke at the end, and uh yeah, off we go. No one seems to have noticed yet. Uh it works.

Samuel
01:03:11
It works well That's good. I I think that's um that's fair. Piece of gamer never allowed a hundred word box out, so it would always have to be something visually extraordinary. And that's how you ended up with like us all um measuring our procedurally generated wangs and rust, for example, in one box out. And it's like and all kinds of like cursed charts and little comparison things and like explanations of weapons and Extraneous detail no one needs, but it looks good, even if like editorially it has no substance. Whereas the edgebox outs are like, here's a chunk of text on on the the the the game you're reading about. You're like, yep, fair, fair. Um so I think that's completely fair, Matthew. Any other tips on cutting down word count, things you strip out?

Matthew
01:03:52
I don't know, I'm pr I'm pretty good at writing to the word count these days, just 'cause of the the the pain of it. It's one of those things that you just sort of do instinctively. It's quite hard to To explain. Uh you know, you I know it when I see it. Like you can do a lot just by cutting out everyone's verries.

Samuel
01:04:09
That is true. Just yeah, that that does the that does the trick. I also normally find that I can make my intro more concise than I do. Like it'll be like a paragraph of waffle. And then the point I'm making in the next paragraph. And I generally think the point should start in The first paragraph or you've kind of fucked it. So uh yeah. Um but I spent so long since I d I've done this that Yeah, the process is very, very taxing to me now. And um yeah, cutting to cutting to a word count is is tricky and knowing when to cut for online is also tricky because you can potentially have an article that goes on forever, but you probably shouldn't. So it's about picking what you keep and what you get rid of, really.

Matthew
01:04:46
I did it too. When I did that Donkey Kong Bonanza review for The Guardian, um I think Keith Stuart uh edited that one actually, um because Keza was away and he cut it from a seven hundred to a six hundred, but he made it he he he did a nice job. It made me look better than I actually am. That review's like super tight. A super tight six hundred.

Samuel
01:05:07
I like that. Um, okay. Uh what is the next one? Yes, it's me. Games magazines are still a better way to learn about new games than websites. This is definitely not a slight towards websites, but I personally think that The most exciting part of seeing a load of edge scores go up is that you uh you discover at least one game every month you've never heard of. And I still prefer that for games discovery than reading about them on websites just because it's the idea that a game can reach the finish line and sort of come out of nowhere and just be like, oh, this matters suddenly and then you go and download it and then you're playing it. Um and I think I just I really like that when uh you know a magazine can can actually do that. And I think that You know, we used to have like a free game section in PC Gamer when I ran it. I don't know if they still do actually, but that was written um by a very sort of like dependable freelancer whose name I've forgotten, Matthew, but he freelanced for OXM as well a lot, actually. It used to be TC Gamers. Yes, yeah, that's right. And so he was like super, super good at like digging out here's a thing you've never heard of. Um here's like a free game you can play and it'll take one hour and it'll be like uh you know, a really interesting sort of conversation starter. Um yeah, I don't know, like I'm not saying that um uh websites can't do this too because they can, but I I really like it when it happens in print media. Do you know what I mean?

Matthew
01:06:29
Oh yeah, I mean s there's so many games don't get reviewed now. It's it's like wild. Like you can look at a you know a a website which I would consider to be you know, pretty good on reviews and you look at them and you see they've done like two reviews in the last week or something and you're like, that's crazy. If if you know, if Edge are reviewing more games a month than you as a print publication, um that's pretty wild, I would say.

Samuel
01:06:54
Yeah, it's funny 'cause uh just in recent months there are games that Edge has reviewed that I've never like heard of before, like Dreams of Another, like God Breakers, or um I I know what this game is now, but Stray Children, for example. Right. Or like Spooky Express and I just feel like they're really good at making sure there's like two to three games like that in a given issue. And there are reviewers that you won't find anywhere else if you do it's on like a tidy website. So yeah, yeah. I'm just um giving that some praise already. What's your next one, Matthew?

Matthew
01:07:25
Rezed was the best games expo and it's a huge bummer, it's gone. Rez was really good.

Samuel
01:07:30
It was I loved Res.

Matthew
01:07:33
PC Gamer Expo is also good. I don't think they've run that for like seven years, so I wouldn't worry about it. You're not offending anyone there. Okay. Yeah, REST, uh for people who don't know it was the Kind of the indie version of EGX. It was held in the is it the Tobacco Docks in London. It was quite a f a fun little venue, but you know, it was all indies or like independent publishers, you know, your devolvers and whatnot. But they used to get some like quite good talent to come and do Q<unk>A's and talk about like the big sort of indie hits. I'd say like it covered everything from the kind of triple A of indie right down to, you know, your proper like one person, like weirdo projects. Um in the left field collection. And you know, if you played any game there, chances are the person manning the stall in made the game rather than being like a person hired to man one of Nintendo's games at the Switch event, say for example. And just being able to like talk to the people who made the games and just have those conversations and everyone there was basically an interesting person and Uh yeah, I really really loved it and I think it's sad that it doesn't really exist anymore. Um obviously in the games. And the left field collection, I th they are represented at EGX or or whatever EGX lives on as now. But um Res was such a laugh.

Samuel
01:08:55
It was really good. It was also, you know, I I I still in my head think of the success of Disco Elysium with starting at. Rest. Yeah. Like the word of mouth came from that event is in you know, in in the circles of games journalists that you and I run in, you know? And I think that is what really s turned it the initial stages of t what turned it into a phenomenon, you know.

Matthew
01:09:18
Um yeah, yeah, definitely. I know it's it's you know, all those people who you now see in endless YouTube documentaries about all their their legal troubles and just remember seeing them there just as a team. talking about their game and you know i yeah it seems like a million years ago that that all happened.

Samuel
01:09:37
Yeah, the pandemic was just a perfect storm for games events. It was like The price of everything went up and the margins on doing events were already really tiny. Like it's really hard to make money on doing an event. And obviously with um an event like Res you'd be dealing with smaller developers and publishers most of the time. So actually getting them to spend money would be would be challenging, combined with like a drop in footfall, 'cause no one wanted to get COVID and that's probably dissipated now as a factor, but In 2022, when they were trying to do that WASD um sort of version of it, which was a valiant attempt to bring it back, it was it was still like people were paranoid about COVID. They didn't have the confidence to go back and the price of things went up. And it just it just means that the game event landscape is permanently changed, you know, and um probably won't come back. Though I would love to see what someone try with this because Yeah, the Tobacco Dock was a very distinct venue and um it was like finite but I I and but loads of little buildings that you could go in and play games. It was really cool. Okay, Matthew. Um People who say games journalism doesn't matter anymore always change their tune when people actually cover their games. Um I feel strongly about this because I have a friend who I will not name in games, but worked on an announcement recently. And there's definitely bitched before about, well, does anyone read these websites? Who really cares? But when people covered his game, that he was like, oh, this website picked it up and this website picked it up. And you encounter that quite a lot where where people are like, Oh, in an age of influencers, who needs press? But the fact is if a load of press review your game and like your game it will still really matter. And um I think that's worth saying in an age of influences where I think people think that just someone making a TikTok video of a game is somehow more valuable than someone taking the time to review your game and talk about it um, you know, to a a pa a passionate audience that might be smaller but might actually buy the damn thing. So

Matthew
01:11:25
Just wanted to say that Matthew, because I think it is um that isn't like a shadow pitch for people giving us review codes to talk about on the podcast. But they can obviously. We get p w but we get most of the codes we want now. Yeah, I'm actually like genuinely upset if someone snubs us. I'm a bit like, do you know who we are?

Samuel
01:11:44
Oh obviously not. Mark, I think there's three publishers who haven't sent us keys ever. And what one's obviously Nintendo, um which I know is the one that drives you a bit spare. But I kinda get it at the same time, they're in demand and it's nice to be even recognized at all. But that's not why I put this in here. Yeah, anyway. Uh what's your next one?

Matthew
01:12:02
Five stars, ten out of ten, and one hundred percent are not the same score, and Metacritic's slightly broken because of it. Ooh, go off. I'm just a real believer that. The more specific a scoring system gets, the harder fought those high scores are. I think it's very easy to give a game five stars in a way that it's a little harder to give it ten out of ten and you would never give a game one hundred percent in a magazine. That just wouldn't happen. And that sites like Metacritic take those scores and turn them all into a number out of a hundred It doesn't reflect what those reviews actually are. Like when I give a game four stars in the Guardian, I'm not giving it 80%. That doesn't reflect you know how I feel about it. Yeah, I just I I think it is It's reductive and uh I just think people should respect scores. But what I'm saying is the hundred percent score scale is the best one, obviously. 'Cause it really lets you to be able to give a game a number out of a hundred, I mean that's uh that takes a fine critical eye. I know the difference between a seventy three and a seventy four. You may not believe that, but I I do know it.

Samuel
01:13:12
I believe you, Matthew. And uh I think I I think I largely agree actually. That's uh That's funny.

Matthew
01:13:18
I don't think anyone cares about this other than I do, but whenever I see anyone discussing one score system versus the others, it's like five stars. Five stars doesn't really do it for me.

Samuel
01:13:28
The yeah I g I I you know as someone who worked on a game that got a five star, and that being the first review I saw when the embargo lifted last year. that uh the absolutely lit me up to see the five gold stars on Eurogamer. That could be one hundred percent. Uh no I didn't think I don't I didn't think that at all. Um It's yeah, I don't know, just I j I think at a certain point anything anything past ninety or anything in that range is just an unequivocal recommendation, isn't it? So But I do agree with you, I think there is a distinction between those scoring systems. I think in general, pitting any where any like outlet scoring system against another is dumb and it's the worst thing that the audience does as a result of Metacritic is kind of like this reductive discussion of what any of what a seven means in edge versus what a seven means on this is a completely random example, but like pure Xbox, for example. And like those aren't are completely different web different outlets for different stuff. Like it's But the audience doesn't understand or care, so you just have to deal with them like writing idiotic nonsense on the internet.

Matthew
01:14:32
I can tell you s scientifically, a seven in edge is 85% in Gamesmaster. Perfect. Don't ask me how I know that, but I do know that.

Samuel
01:14:43
That's okay. You never have to explain to me, Matthew, it's fine. Um US games media and UK games media were nothing alike. and they still exist in parallel realities. Um this is just an observation about how, you know, if you wanted to hire a games journalist in San Francisco You could, you know, like even ten years ago, you could easily be paid like 90 grand plus because that's the cost of living in San Francisco. But it's a very different world to being like a tw a staff writer on 12K in Bournemouth I would say like so different that they were basically like different professions. And you really felt this when you went on press trips. Like I think the US games journals carried themselves like they were proper journalists. Whereas I think that um it sort of always looked like you got some lads who worked at Pizza Hut um on an airplane for you when you brought them to like an event in the US Um but you know what I mean? Like there's uh there's just a such a pronounced difference between UK and US games journalists. I think that's still true. I think they still see it as like you know, the US games journalists that are left 'cause I know that field's been hit really hard in the last like few years. Yeah. But like it's I just think it was a bit A little bit more mom and pop in the UK. And we car kind of carry that as a chip on our shoulder a little bit, I think.

Matthew
01:15:51
I I definitely think the the UK or e anything non U any non US gaming scene just isn't really thought of by the US gaming scene a little bit. And so when they're like, there's only one outlet left, and you're like, well, I've got loads of friends who are working on outlets, and you know, you what you just don't consider those because they're They're not one of the five American outlets you know and like, but yeah.

Samuel
01:16:15
Uh, you know, it is as it ever was. Yeah, it is a little bit. And uh yeah, and I don't know, it's quite fun to carry that chip on your shoulder I find.

Matthew
01:16:23
Um

Samuel
01:16:24
Spike carries you a long way in this industry, you know.

Matthew
01:16:26
It's our horrible wages are what probably sort of sustains this industry for a bit longer in the UK. It's the fucking grim reality of it. That is that is true. I think that's true. Uh okay, what's the next one, Matthew? Try not to over-research your interview subjects. Preconceptions and a head full of you know answers I think can shape an interview in a bad way. Um Uh this is a kind of continuation of the thread from our chat with Matt Leone about good and bad interview practice and it just got me thinking about where I've I yeah, I tend to go like all in and I'll read like every interview that was ever available with a person to the point where I feel like I've heard some of their answers already and I think that's maybe dangerous territory for an interview because y you either don't cover some like crucial basics or you can assume you're gonna get a certain answer and it doesn't really give the person opportunity to have changed their own opinions or have grown in that time and uh yeah it's it's yeah definitely something I've noticed uh the last couple of big interviews I've done. I just feel like Or I didn't really give them a enough space to properly express themselves.

Samuel
01:17:41
Yeah. Side note, do you think we should have got Peter Bohr on our podcast? Because he did the rounds with a bunch of people. And like I he uh he is someone who I think mythologizes a bit when he talks about his time at Sega or Xbox. But he's also a a very like uh charismatic speaker and I think he might have made a good podcast guess, but I think I kinda thought he won't be interested in speaking to us. But then I saw him talk to Eurogamer and actually wondered maybe he would have been. I don't know if you had any thoughts on that one. Yeah, New York Gamer's a little bigger than us. I mean, yeah, that's true. I mean millions. Millions bigger. But I don't know. I saw him doing some other podcasts as well. Uh like business podcasts and stuff. And I don't know, maybe we should have asked.

Matthew
01:18:20
I often see big names appear in places I wouldn't expect them to appear, which actually makes me think these people are more open to it and maybe we should just try our luck and ask.

Samuel
01:18:29
Yeah, that's it. So that'll be um Ken Levine on a Games Score episode next year. Look forward to it. It should be good. Um Ken Levine versus Judge Castle. And Ken Levine will do all the world building for Castle Island, and it'll be He'll be incredibly rich and deep. Okay, Matthew. Um I do agree with you actually. It's um it's a good point, I think, that uh yeah, I mean you've been wrestling with this loads because you interviewed Shou Takumi and that other bloke you chatted to Matt Leone about um in for a profound waste of time. Who's your guy? Kidaka. Yeah. I could tell that really ate away at you. So I feel like this point is related to that more than anything, you know? Um yeah. Okay. Um all right. Um games media always needs more perspectives beyond white guys. Brackets, ironic saying that on this podcast, I know. Um yeah, I mean I really I really do believe this, and it's something we wrestle with a bit, is that We are aware that we're very bloke heavy. And it kind of and when we just haven't had like, you know, just someone who's not a white guy on as a guest for like months, I'm like, ah, like maybe we should be trying a bit harder. And I think that games media in recent years, if you look at a website like GamesRadar, the makeup of that team is, you know, just a a way larger array of voices than it had like 10 years ago. And I do think that just adds so much. And it's you get the kind of games right you just wouldn't have got, um, you know, sort of like ten years ago as a result. And that's good because you find that you know, a lot of the people of our generation have the same few corners that they're interested in and you know, like uh and sort of grew up at the same time. So yeah, I just really I really firmly believe this. You know, definitely have any thoughts on this one, Matthew.

Matthew
01:20:07
Yeah, I'm I'm you know, in complete agreement but also a slight reddening of the cheeks when I realise, you know, you gotta practice what you preach. Um you know, I can d defend our actions, but if that's our problem or not. You're not you're not under attack. I've just I've just pointed it out. No, I I know I will say 'cause a lot a lot of the People we've interviewed ha are people who are like known to us and we're friends with already. Yeah.

Samuel
01:20:33
And we feel and we feel we take a risk when we bring on anyone who isn't.

Matthew
01:20:36
That's that's the thing. So it's it it's it's a case of like do we just have strangers to us and see what happens and something to wrestle with in twenty twenty six.

Samuel
01:20:45
And there's a and there's a bummer when like, I don't know, let's say in one year, two of your your female contributors get hired at companies where they can no longer really do podcasts and it's like, ah, they're gone. We can no longer like And their perspective is just gone. And so it's just like, oh, so we have to kind of try again. I mean, these are things for us to wrestle with. But I just think this is true in general really. Um uh in it true of any um any kind of like criticism of any kind of media. Uh what's your next one, Matthew?

Matthew
01:21:12
Try to review a game in isolation. It's always really obvious when reviewers have been on a group chat with each other. Not pointing any fingers at any particular review. Uh I've just like, noticed over the years with the, you know, rise of Twitter and whatnot that come big game reviews. There tends to be more DM chatter around these things and like a oh, how you feelin' about this or how you feelin' about that and I I really do try and keep any other opinion out of my head as best I can. Again, I don't know who this advice is for.

Samuel
01:21:47
Just I think it's for the best. Remember, when you go out into the town square and you ring the bell, you really want to do that town crier ring incredibly loud, just so everyone in the village square can hear you, okay? Just Remember that's my number one piece of advice for being a town crier. That's a bell mot. Just really fucking ring that bell and uh the townsfolk will really appreciate it. Um Okay Matthew. Um where was I? Uh here we go. Search engines damaged everything great about games media, but the publishers prioritise short-term wins over all else, so the blame is shared between them. Um this is a bit of an online kind of gripe really, but relates to sort of a larger thing with media where they've definitely you know, marched to the tune of Google over the years and now um AI snippets eating their traffic alive. So it's almost like they've been um sort of dancing for their executioner a little bit. Um instead of like building a business that sustains itself, you know, without any of Google's help. Um and it feels like if if everyone could redo it again and have like, I don't know, a readership of a hundred thousand paying people as opposed to 10 million readers who are it's all based on like ads, it's all based on traffic and making them land on your website. I think they would redo it um to to have more websites in that vein. But instead, hey everyone went for that Google traffic. Everyone did guys. Everyone did all all kinds of like search engine related, you know, sort of like seeing what people are searching for and writing articles around that, structuring headlines around that. And it definitely morphed the end product, you know? It just meant that you were forced to say more and more absurd things in your headlines to get people to click. And even if they do represent on some level what you believe. They can be so sort of noisy that they come across as antagonistic to the reader. And it's not a great reading experience versus like uh, you know, the the comforting sort of like confines of reading a magazine, for example. So search engines have really like done a number on games media. And yeah, it's uh just wanted to point that out really, but The publishers didn't have to do it that way. They chose to do it because they they saw it as a little pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and they just they they thought about the short term rather than the long term, Matthew. Don't you have any thoughts on that?

Matthew
01:24:04
No, I I I'd agree with that. Uh a lot of my web use these days are actually a few kind of paywalled sites where I just pay to kind of cut out all the horseshit. uh and uh it means I don't have a lot of internet curiosity which seems like it runs counter to the point of the internet, you know, like the you know, a place where you can get infinite perspectives, but I feel like it's infinite perspectives funneled through all that horse shit. So um yeah, it's a it's a real bummer. And even we do it by you know, calling our review episodes two giant men. I mean that's that's over the top. We're not that giant.

Samuel
01:24:42
I think did I tell you that someone was like actually disappointed I wasn't that giant when they met me in person recently. Did I tell you about that? Oh really? Yeah, it's um Andrew Williams who writes for uh shortlist and he's a fan of the podcast. He saw he saw me next to Day Scarborough, who was like a foot taller than me and was like

Matthew
01:25:01
Well, you're the giant man, but you're but but Dave's like twice as tall as you, and I think he was a bit like ah I think if we'd been standing next to each other though, I think we'd we'd really just like Oh, there's two larger people together.

Samuel
01:25:14
Well that's the thing. I think that I'm not that tall, but I'm got really broad shoulders, so I seem large, you know what I mean? Um I'll tell you something weird that happened the other day though. So walking through Bar City Center And there were like a gang of like schoolgirls who I guess it must have been lunchtime or something. And they were all one foot taller than me. And I thought Is this gonna be the thing where like happened to my dad where I I was once average height, but now like fucking e-numbers or whatever is like turning the next generation of children into fucking giants, so I'm gonna be like the world's smallest man in like th 30 years. Like uh it genuinely crossed my mind, Matthew, but uh yeah.

Matthew
01:25:52
Wow, I mean I I w I will always notice is if someone's taller than me, but it's very rare that that happens. I'll maybe see like in a week a couple of people who register as tall, but to see A a group of tall girls. That's crazy.

Samuel
01:26:08
They weren't all they weren't on like stilts or something. No. And it wasn't like a Yunchi Ito short story or anything like that. It was uh Well they're all just like they're all in that kind of like slight sort of Catholic schoolgirl get up and they were all walking behind me and like catching up because I don't think my legs were like long enough to like escape them basically. Like there was a I I ended up like crossing the road to get away from them because I thought they're just sort of gaining on me. Like and it's just they're so all these tall girls, it's quite odd. So yeah, that was uh a thing that happened to me um in Bar Tail Tales of Bath City Centre. Uh so yes, um I can't remember what point we were making here. Oh, but the two giant men things just fun really. That's not like Oh yeah, I know that that is a clickbait. If we just wrote, you know, GTA V revisited, it'd probably get as many clicks, but the two giant men things just fun, isn't it? So uh yeah. Anyway. Um what's your next one, Matthew?

Matthew
01:27:04
Uh this is my weakest one by far. Try to end every relationship on good terms. In the UK, uh gaming is a ludicrously small industry. Which I think is true. It's a bit trite. And it's a bit like, yeah, well of course, I mean that's just words to live by. I think whatever you do. But I am always amazed at how my path crosses with, you know, people who you know, I've worked with at one point or had minor beef with at one point where I think, oh, I'm glad I didn't do anything. I'm glad I didn't escalate that situation. because here we both are now and uh yeah that just happens a lot you it's it's noticeable in the UK games industry I think.

Samuel
01:27:46
Yeah, I think this is good advice for anyone in any industry, whether it's, you know, uh anything related with where relationships are important, bigger town crier, for example, important to have it relationships with the townsfolk, you know, because You want to be back in that job next year. Um, you know, the the guy who repairs your bell, you want to be on good terms with him, you know, that's important, I think. But um Come on, keep it going. What else might a town crier want?

Matthew
01:28:09
Come on.

Samuel
01:28:09
No I'm out of material.

Matthew
01:28:11
It's done.

Samuel
01:28:12
Draws a line at bell repair, man. Less a tight five and more a tight type one, to be honest. It wasn't uh it wasn't ideal. Uh guy who repairs the bell. Um yeah, so I mean I I would like to say I think is I was definitely a pricky motherfucker when I started working in games. Um I'd say everyone who I had beef beef with in my early days no longer really works in the industry, which is good. Um even the one person who like that disproves my whole point, but one of the w I think over time everyone kind of mellows out a little bit. And I really yeah the other day actually someone said to me, um, you know, you're really easy to work with and I was like, Well thank you, I appreciate that because I really have a serving anecdote to tell. Well no, but the reason I mention it is no one would have said that to me ten years ago. Like See you you agree immediately. So the anecdote wasn't over for your information, Matthew. But I I think I was uh you know I can still be a prickly motherfucker as um you know residents of the discord will no doubt agree. But like the um in terms of like the workplace and interactions of people I actually meet day to day, I do like just try and be as simple to work with as possible because I just you know, you you learn that over time that's what that's what people gravitate towards. That's what's important. They don't want to work with prickly people. They don't want people who are inconsistent one day to another. And I think that's just that just speaks to what you you know, your point there. Like Having those kind of relationships are built on that. I'm built on people feeling like they can come up to you without it ever being like a big deal. So yeah, I really think it's just good to to do that no matter what.

Matthew
01:29:45
Also on the uh the smallest of the industry, something that always tickles me is that in my day job we occasionally interact with people in video games and every once in a while I'll just happen upon a listener or so someone will either say, Oh, I listen to the podcast and then it's like a whole thing and that's funny. Or sometimes you can you you get a hint of like, oh I think they not to be like, you know, ooh get me, but you get a hint of like, oh I think they recognize like the name or the voice. And then sometimes I'll get a message from you later going, Oh, so and so messaged me, said you're on a call with them or whatever and then I'm like, Oh yeah, that's funny. The idea that it's small enough that you know, we may bump into a listener in our other jobs.

Samuel
01:30:30
Yeah, which is why it's important not to slag off people on the podcast really.

Matthew
01:30:34
That's why I never do. Yeah, that's why I never do.

Samuel
01:30:38
So I'm gonna cut my uh reference to a uh to a certain outlet um earlier in the episode, Matthew, to um before this goes live to preserve uh uh preserve my own sanity and working relationships. Um anyway. Um yes, next up then. Um guide writers will never get credit for doing a good job. I think this is um just true no matter what. This is true going back to like the the days where I was in the Imagine office And there was like um writers on Powerstation magazine when that had like a full team, like PlayStation Tips magazine. It didn't last long into the PS3 era. They closed it down, but Man, they worked so hard and all they did was be glued to their screens capturing from like PS3 games uh brown screenshots from those all day and having to like get to them uh you know, uh to to screen grab every little secret from a a game no matter how hard and fiddly it was, how to get all the different fucking pigeons in GTA 4 or whatever it is. Like it's so thankless doing guides content. And so if people are passionate about it, I mean I I admire they do it. But I think in general everyone is always there's Everyone's got a need for this kind of content in games, no matter which games you play. Some someone has gone out and done that work, and I think it's perpetually undervalued. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
01:31:51
I know I absolutely agree. Uh s something that often makes me laugh is This has happened several times now where I've been looking at old walkthroughs on game FAQs and they're written by someone who I now know to be a games writer on a site And they were just written as a teenager and it's like you were committed to the the guides thing like before it was a job that is so hardcore Uh I got a huge amount of respect for it. I'm pretty sure uh Matt Reynolds, uh formerly of Polygon, like I've seen his internet handle on game FAQs for like you know, Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube.

Samuel
01:32:28
Wow. That's that's like a 20 year old game at this point. So yeah, that's um that's really something. So yeah, they're just And they never they never get the credit for it, you know. You'll never someone someone would never be like, you know what, this guide was amazing and it gets shared by like a hundred people. Never happens. But it will happen if like, I don't know, you write a particularly cool article about something. People will say that about your work.

Matthew
01:32:50
If people were paid by how much their work actually supports the website guides, people would be paid like five times more than anyone else.

Samuel
01:32:58
Oh yeah, and the ma and the majority of the staff would resign because they weren't being paid enough. That's what would happen, honestly, as as a result of that. Um so yeah. That's funny. Um okay Matthew. My next oh no, it's your next one, sorry.

Matthew
01:33:12
This is one of my grumpier ones. Websites using the language of magazines, i. e. referring to their big story as a cover story I think that's cultural appropriation. You're not a fucking magazine. You're a website. You killed the magazines. Don't pretend you're cool like magazines. You will never be cool like magazines.

Samuel
01:33:30
That's funny. Um oh this got this reminded me of something when I read this one. It reminded me of how ten years ago, when you'd ever you get a cab ride with like uh you know, like to the to the airport or to the to the station or something. The cab driver would start talking about Uber and how what an existential threat Uber was. And I always sat there thinking, you don't hear me going. Aw, let me tell you about websites, mate. I worked in print media and they fucking destroyed my my living. But they assume that their profession Is valuable enough that I need to hear about it. But if I talked about what my profession and how it was destroyed by websites, that guy wouldn't give a fuck. That's just That's something I just thought about as I read this really, is that like um you always feel like you're fruitlessly shouting from the sidelines when you talk about this stuff.

Matthew
01:34:14
Oh, this is one of my most fruitlessly held stances

Samuel
01:34:19
Yeah. But I I kind of I kind of agree because y it's not really a cover feature if it's just at the top of a website, really, you know.

Matthew
01:34:27
You're not a publication. If you're a website whose homepage is just fifty bits of random shit. You can't then just pick one and elevate it to a cover feature. Like cover feature, that's what goes on the front of a curated experience, which these sites are not.

Samuel
01:34:42
I th th thing is, I do Disagree with you what with one case. Like when Game Informer used to do this kind of thing. Oh they do you remember when they had wait, that was 'cause they were a magazine and it was their cover story. It was, but they would also have like those sixty-nine questions about the game.

Matthew
01:34:58
Like they wouldn't worry about them at all with this. Like that you know, that was a brilliant reuse of you know the magazine access on our website, you know, a kind of that's the thing. Perfect synergy. It just when I see it now I'm just like, give me a break. What do you fucking know about magazines? They're really fucking hard and no one who works on them does it anymore.

Samuel
01:35:22
Yeah, we got no credit from why we did them. And we weren't paid very well and then they just went away. And that's their that's their entire story. There is no other story. Oh dear. That's funny. Um this is connected to the um the other one I said about search engines. The future of games journalism is smaller specialist websites or video channels or maybe even podcasts, supported directly by their audience. This is true for all media really. It's like Matthew says, it's like a smaller pool of things that you pay for. I think games journalism could probably use a few more places that do this, although a lot of the um sites launched by X Podigan people definitely have their own version of this. Um you know just finding innovative ways to reach those readerships. In some ways I want to see like a I want to see like a big website do this. like uh you know just one that's not corporate owned but like it's a website with some kind of like legacy to it. Just go, okay, this is now, you know, without pay put the paywall up, but if you really believe in what we're doing then please do uh support us. Um so yeah I think it it's kind of uh we've seen a few different examples of this in other media like sports and and sort of that kind of thing and Vulture is uh seems to have like made this work. You know, you pay like your forty dollars a year and you can access the whole lot um across loads of different websites, all their newsletters and stuff. And I just think that this is where things are going. It's less about, oh, you know, we had this article on this website that has a hundred million users. And it's more like, well We actually reached 50,000 paying customers, which is probably more valuable than these randos anyway. So, you know, just just wanted to share that, Matthew. No, I agree. Yeah. Okay, well what's the next one?

Matthew
01:36:59
Oh this is this is a very technical bit on cover lines and video titles. S so get ready for some laughs. Start with your video title or cover line and work backwards. It's much harder to add a hook after the fact. And I say this from experience. I I wasn't a a great cover line person, as as we all know from uh when we did our episodes about covers. Uh I I always struggled because we'd have all this stuff which I loved, all the you know, all these great words inside the magazine, but then it'd be like, oh how do you package this up in like a you know, a shouty, attractive, hooky way And, you know, some things, no matter how good or satisfying they may be to read, don't necessarily have that neat packaging and I think working in video made me much more aware of of you know, thinking about that that point of access and then sort of taking the steps back to well, you know, if that'll get them in, then what could that actually be? And we'll work the video out from there rather than Rather than think about the most important bit last, basically.

Samuel
01:38:10
Again, you know, if you're setting up a magazine, I hope that advice is useful for you and uh yeah Um to all my town criers out there, we're having the annual meetup at the uh AGM. Um so just come down and uh you know say you're setting up official Town Crier magazine. Yeah Oh yeah, circulation 300 copies. I of course worked for the unofficial tea crier. Fuck's sake, Matthew. Okay, moving on. This is actually connected to the one about guide writers and should have came straight after. Um that's an editing error on my part. That's exactly why you need sub-editors and production editors, Matthew. They'll never get credit for doing a great job. It's a very intensive job putting edge together, but uh like making sure all those all the text fits and all the things are in the right place, that kind of stuff.

Matthew
01:39:06
Invaluable work, but um Getting rid of bad semicolons.

Samuel
01:39:10
Indeed, so uh yes, a shout-out. Okay, what's your next one?

Matthew
01:39:18
There is no shame in reaching out to a developer if you get stuck during a review.

Samuel
01:39:23
Oh, is have you done this in recent times?

Matthew
01:39:25
I haven't done this in recent times, but I've I have done it and I don't feel shame about it I I tell you what, I uh I did it for both Outer Wilds and then the DLC. I had to interview I had to reach out to them. 'Cause I was like, I am I am missing something. I you know, I I'd play it got to a point where I'd played like five or six hours with making like no progress in it. thinking like I am really missing something here. And I reached out to them and it was interesting actually. I think they have definitely with Outer Worlds since tweaked the bit. just because enough people got in touch during the review period going, you're gonna have to really help me with this. And they they had a really good system where they'd send you like a cryptic clue rather than telling you what to do. So they'd they'd sort of prepare it for so you could still feel some satisfaction from discovering it. Uh I really like that. And then the same thing happened with um this is less impressive. Luigi's Mansion 2. I just couldn't find a collectible jewel and I sent an email to next level games being like, I can't find this last jewel on level one like proper Gamesmaster shit. Dear Gamesmaster, I desperately need your help. Where's the jewel on level one? And yeah, and then got an email back from someone who I've never met, but you know, I think like the director of Luigi's Mansion 2 going Oh yeah, the jewels, you know, in the armour at the start.

Samuel
01:40:50
So There's some PR manager out there who'd have like be breaking into a cold sweat knowing you were directly emailing devs about about their games. Um that's funny though. I uh I approve. I like the idea that maybe with Outer Wilds he just sent off an email saying, Dear Massey Oka, I enjoyed your work in heroes, but I know I Now I need your help once again, sir. And then explain the problem. Oh dear. Um yeah, anyway, uh next up, where was I? Um Oh, re this is really spicy. Do I believe this? I'm just gonna say it and we'll see what happens. This kind of speaks to all the other problems of the internet I was describing earlier. Um recommending people get into media now is borderline immoral and no one should be charging for journalism degrees in 2025. Um, I went on a date with someone who has like a journalism class she teaches like once a week and it it was a whole room of people who were going for, you know, who w who want to work in media in the future and like it's in such an uncertain place because of AI and everything else, you know, just like the and just the fact that it's always been on the squeeze for basically like the You know, the since the internet really began, um, since online publications began. And I surely like if you've got a room full of like 20 to 30 people who want to get into journalism, like, are there even Just from that one class, twenty to thirty jobs for them to do? Like if you go on LinkedIn right now, I'd be surprised that there are more than Like fifteen like UK journalism jobs like in general, you know. I don't think you have any thoughts on this, Matthew.

Matthew
01:42:25
Oh, I mean I I I I do agree. I think it's super bleak. I mean I th I I'd couch it with You know for some people you know going tight, you know, higher education, university The general experience of it, rather than necessarily the specific thing, is is the kind of key bit of growth. And while I I kind of I do I do agree the idea it's not as neat as like if you take this course you can have this job because that job doesn't exist anymore and that's definitely true. But I also I I'm not quite at a point of telling people like what they should and shouldn't be doing at university, you know. Oh yeah, I I'm not saying that either, really. It's it's tough. Uh no no no that's not what you're saying. It's it's it's kinda like It's like the sad undercurrent of it. But I think people are aware and maybe they just you know, they maybe want that like learning, living experience and if the thing they're most interested in is journalism then maybe that's not so bad doing that.

Samuel
01:43:28
Yeah, and this is this is also not me putting the onus on the student. people either recommending it or like selling those degrees. Like the universities themselves, you know.

Matthew
01:43:39
When you look at yeah, when you look at uh Yeah, like websites or prospectuses or whatever and like the language of promise around it is kind of wild where you're like Well that just isn't true. You should be very upfront saying, listen, we'll do our best, we'll teach you this. It will probably improve you as a person to know these things, but there's absolutely no guarantee. In fact There's less than no guarantee. Yeah. At the end of this. Uh yeah. Yeah, interesting. Uh okay.

Samuel
01:44:10
All right, what's the next one?

Matthew
01:44:11
That wasn't too spicy. There's no shame in using tired conventions, a list feature say, uh to smuggle your best writing uh out there. uh anything to get someone to read. Again this is kind of linked to the video stuff where I basically turned everything into a seven list regardless of what it was, if it was a preview, review just a video essay about a game because I I didn't believe in the strength of the channel to for people just to naturally click on the videos, but I believed in the powers of numbers. So even they have had a number in the title, it never really worked like a numbered list. Um I I guess w you know. The plea I'm making with this is you know, look past look past the thumbnail and the obnoxious title and the dumb cover line, because it isn't necessarily reflective of the quality of what you're gonna get.

Samuel
01:45:05
Yeah, I mean, you know, this even extends to our podcast and the fact that we do the best games of 2016. And then there's an hour and a half of what happened in the E3 that year. what sort of like happened to your knee that year at Gamescom and then what happened to us personally in that way I put in my mini fridge. Important stuff. And then you get like an hour and twenty minutes at the end that deliver on the the premise. And I think it's it's just true. I mean This is drilled into you. But yeah, the goal the end goal is to connect with viewers or readers. So I think it makes total sense, Matthew. No, no disagreement here. Um, where was I? Oh yeah, podcasting is to video what print media is to online media. I mean I've I kind of got into podcasts in a way that I never really have with Video, uh so watching videos. Like it's just not a persistent part of my life. I I know you have YouTube Premium at home, so you may be a big video essay guy, and I just don't know. I'm really not. Well that's what I mean. And so And I've recently been bummed out by the the ringer um moving all their podcasts to video because I can feel the changes it's made where every now and then one of them will say something preposterous because I think it's designed to be a one minute clip they can stick into a YouTube short or wherever, and I'm like Hmm. Well this used to be like a little closed ecosystem, didn't it? Where you could say sensible things and it didn't have to be like a a big deal. And so I I think that the way that video infects has aff infected podcasting a little bit bums me out and I like podcasting being their own little clothes thing off to the side. There's no chance this will ever be a video podcast and I take a bit of pride in that. What do you think of this?

Matthew
01:46:36
Yeah, I I'd agree with that. In a way there's there's like no reason podcasts shouldn't behave like video, but they kinda don't. I guess it's like the weekly episode structure. Like more and more I've seen like people bringing like more of an editorial bent to them. And maybe that's just because the the ones I happen to listen to have a bit more sort of shape and direction rather than just you know, three good pals chatting away. Um yeah, I I I can definitely see the distinction there and it probably speaks to why you know, podcasts are more appealing to me than video.

Samuel
01:47:11
Yeah. Um, we are old after all. What is your next one, Matthew?

Matthew
01:47:15
There is that, yes. Um Uh, if you're late to the party, there's no point joining a reviews pylon. Uh which is to say, you haven't reviewed a game because they didn't send it out to review. But a couple of reviews come out and it's like a proper stinker, like a mind's eye for example, and it gets a three out of ten. I feel like it's understood what that game is at that point. And if you are then using your budget Just to throw another kicking on top of all those other kickings. I just think that's money you could be spending to elevate something good instead, basically. I s I see and it doesn't happen very often because reviews are generally quite positive for things. J Like it's very, very rare that you get much below a seven out of ten from a lot of a lot of big sites, but I have seen it with Yeah, like at Mind's Eye or maybe that Gollum or whatever where after a couple of big outlets are giving it one out of ten, I don't know why a week later you're like, Oh yeah, here's my one out of ten You're like, Well we we all know it's shit. I d I don't know. I it it bugs me a little bit.

Samuel
01:48:14
Yeah, I have I think I have s a slightly different feeling on this than I used to have as well, where like it, you know, you you just you can see what happens to the developers of mind's eye. um you can read about it. You know, they've they've talked about it. It's like people have lost their jobs and it's a disaster. And they spent loads of money on it. And the end result was a shit game. And that's clearly a management problem. There's no reason that game should have been shit. They had all those years, they had all that money. But they were clearly trying to do too many things at once when they should have just made one good game. But ultimately, working people have paid the price for that. And so Yeah, I agree with you, like, past a certain point.

Matthew
01:48:51
I mean all we all knew day one that mine's I was shit, you know, so it's I guess the vagueness of of this point is like, well, what is the point of you know, cut off with this, you know, you know, how many how many reviews before you're like, well this is obviously, you know, clearly flawed? I mean with that one I think when all the videos were out and you could just see it being like phenomenally broken Um it does it felt very obvious but you obviously have a right to review whatever you want but I just don't I don't know what you get out of reviewing reviewing a game which is known to be terrible. Like when I don't know, just pick something else instead. Just yeah like tell tell an unknown game story instead, you know? Isn't isn't that more rewarding?

Samuel
01:49:32
It's uh Golem's another one where I've got a slightly different perspective on this. Like I met the Daydelit guys who are working on that just as they got that license in 2019. I was on some press I was on some press trip there. at their office. Extremely nice, just like softly spoken German men basically who were like, Oh, we've got this big license and you know we're really I would we'd love to say what it is but we can't but like we're really excited to work in it and things like that. Like You know, how however you assume these things might start out, they're never like let's get a quick buck. They're always like, How do we make the best game we can? And then things may not pan out that way for various reasons. So You know, I look to that golem being golem game being kicked as like a a bit of a tragedy that the game was so bad because no one went into it wanting it to be bad. Yeah. Yeah. So I I do agree with you, Matthew. Um Yes, even though I've definitely written my own fair share of kickings.

Matthew
01:50:32
And if that's known and it's out there, I just won't talk about it. You know, I'll choose not to talk about it because I feel like well I'm not I'm not adding anything to that conversation at all, you know?

Samuel
01:50:41
Mm-hmm For sure. Okay. Um, what is the next one that I've got to read out? Can't remember. Got we're near the end now. Here we go. Deals articles suck, but uh websites have to make money somehow. Thing is like e-comm's articles, Black Friday deals, people complain about them and stuff, but they also don't pay for websites. And, you know, it's hard to pay for websites harder and harder. And so A sort of deals article here or there. Yes, it's a bummer when an entire homepage gets taken over by fucking Black Friday. And I don't think websites should do that because it's just bad in general. But There is a reason they are there and like people don't want game sites to make money for any reason. They don't like ads and they don't like these articles and they don't like paying for stuff and it's like well they gotta make money at some point. So uh sometimes this is another thing that people use to Kick media brands as being worse than they used to be because they do this now. And it's like, well it became harder to make money on the internet than it was. 20 years ago. So what do you want from them basically? Short but sweet, Matthew. Um but that doesn't mean I think the articles are good. I've written many and they are not fun. So uh yes, um, what's your next one?

Matthew
01:51:49
This came up when we did our Nintendo List trilogy that everyone loves so much. The most important entry in the list feature is the lowest entry. Use it to set the tone, mess with the expectations, and get people excited for the list to come. What was the d the number 50 in ours again? Well I mean I don't remember. I'll find that in the background. That's funny. I mean that I mean that would maybe speak to this point being horseshit.

Samuel
01:52:15
I mean we may not split to that list not being very memorable, but Um No, we we did think about it and y in fact the it definitely represents some thought process here. Our number fifty was last window, The Secret of Cape West, Matthew.

Matthew
01:52:28
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We're open to some interesting stuff in this list. Anything could happen. Uh. And we may forget it in a year's time, but yeah. Yeah, I I d I I used to talk about this a lot with people on Mags who you know I work with and Uh I I feel like the debate around the f the hundred spot or the fifty spot or whatever was just uh h way more hotly contested than you know, the inevitability of the number one in a way. So I am a big believer in this.

Samuel
01:53:00
Makes sense Matthew. My next one is the best games magazines always created their own universe around a platform or games in general. I think that the internet age has given way to consensus thinking, sort of poisoning the way we think about things and talk about things. Um whether it's like a certain opinion that people have that's just replicated um sort of over and over again. I saw someone on a Discord the other day talk about how um this is something I'd seen in the Ringer actually where Chris Ryan there said that the Avatar movies were such a waste of time for like James Cameron and what he could have been doing with his movie career and all that stuff. And I've seen that repeated on Blue Sky and I saw it repeated in our Discord. Like and I don't think I'd even really seen that take until a few months ago. I think a lot of people were like probably believe it but would never but never really articulated it. Now I'm seeing it more and more. And I just I sort of like that bums me out. I like it when all I like about magazines is they just they can pretend that none of that exists, that the internet doesn't exist and that like you are sort of setting your own agenda of what things matter and and that sort of thing. Um and I just think that's the best magazines were great at doing that. Like N64 was amazing at doing that. And PC Game was amazing at doing that because, you know, and and still is, but like they you know, existing in an age with no internet meant that you just had to you had to sort of like Create your own version of the truth basically and tell it to people.

Matthew
01:54:22
Um yeah, that's that's the point really, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. I agree with that. Though I am bad for you know, taking messages and ideas from those locked-in communities and then adopting it as my own in the same way that people now do with the internet. So

Samuel
01:54:39
Yeah, I guess uh yeah that's that is true, but um you know it's still more interesting than just I agree.

Matthew
01:54:45
Yeah.

Samuel
01:54:45
Okay, what's the next one?

Matthew
01:54:47
Uh reviewers shouldn't give a range of hours for how long a game takes. It didn't take you a range of hours, it took you a specific time, so tell me that That is specific, I like it. It's a specific I kn th th then nothing bugs me more then. Ah, it takes about ten to twenty hours. What which is it? One of those things is twice the size of the other thing. That's fucking insane. Oh it took me 15 to 20 hours. Did it? It took you a r a range of time. No it didn't. That's just fucking it's s it's dumb and it's lazy. It ugh, I hate that. I hate that in reviews. I was explaining this to Catherine before we recorded and she said, I don't know if that's really a thing anyone cares about. But I care about it.

Samuel
01:55:35
That's really funny.

Matthew
01:55:36
Just say it took you twenty-two hours. That's fine.

Samuel
01:55:39
Yeah, I yeah, I I I think that's uh I think that's okay. Um it's I think it's also to b i I think like related to this, it's also fine not to finish a game for a review. Um if you get the general idea of the game, that's okay. I would say I played enough of Assassin's Creed Shadows this year to get the idea. Um I played like five hours or something. You played like five to fifty hours. You play more than fifty hours of that game.

Matthew
01:56:03
I played like fifty to one hundred hours of that game. Oh, see how unsatisfying that is

Samuel
01:56:09
How granular do you want to get? Do you want to be like, it was 22 and a half hours, spread over three days. On the first day I ate KFC. On the second day I had a curry. On the third day, I got a Sainsbury salad. Like, you know, how granular you want to get here, Matthew? It's you know Yes.

Matthew
01:56:22
I won't I think you should have to wear like an activity watch, like a heart rate meter. for the time that you're doing it and you should print all that information that I can see you like, you know, when you were static playing the game. L That's what I want to see.

Samuel
01:56:35
Okay, my next one. Um penultimate one. There is still nothing better than holding a print magazine that contains something you wrote. That's uh very simple one, but When I mean even when I haven't written something I I get excited about a print media product, but seeing your name in something is still exciting, Matthew.

Matthew
01:56:50
So um yeah, it's just true.

Samuel
01:56:52
It's just, you know. You you look at it and you're like, oh man, that's there it is immortalized. It can never be scrubbed off the internet because some motherfucker's got a new SEO strategy and they're gonna delete all our old pages or whatever. Like it's None of that business. It's just better.

Matthew
01:57:05
You have to use the the way back machine to find a a photo of me in issue four of Endgamer.

Samuel
01:57:12
Well it's the open ultimate one, Matthew.

Matthew
01:57:13
N Don't fill your magazine redesign with concepts that only make sense when you've got a four month run-up. Uh this happens all the time where you're like Oh, we're making this mag, we're making the redesign for four months. You can get stuff in that first issue you'll never ever be able to repeat or do again. So don't make that like the core of it. Or we're gonna have an i a six-page interview with bespoke photography every issue. That was absolute death on official Xbox magazine. And eventually we just started running really shitty not bespoke photography because we had a slot we had to fill. So um yeah, that one's That one sticks with me. Um my penultimate one. Uh just so that we end on the right ones. Uh this is really dumb. Under every journalist's jumper is a terrible branded t-shirt. I think that's true.

Samuel
01:58:04
Uh I don't think that is true actually.

Matthew
01:58:07
You don't wear any merch.

Samuel
01:58:09
No, I don't. I don't. I don't wear any merch. The only time I ever wore merch was I got these two I got a really cool Red Dead Redemption t-shirt for the original game and I wore that without covering up because it was a cool shirt that Rockstar gave me. I had another one that was like the Rockstar logo with like rainbow colours. I would never wear those kind of clothes now. But um I don't think I've worn Yeah and I say that. I recently did, because it was cold, wear my uh Mindsei Branded Champion hoodie, Matthew. I did and I'll probably wear that when I go to Sweden. Um later this week. Um just to keep me warm. But it seems like a bit whenever I explain it. It's like it's not, it's just because it's quite warm.

Matthew
01:58:50
I've got three Fallout 76 t-shirts which are my nighttime t-shirts.

Samuel
01:58:56
Yeah, have you have you got the glow in the dark one from that version? But like under a jumper suggests that you're going out wearing these. I can't imagine that you go to like the Reach office wearing your Fallout 76 shirts.

Matthew
01:59:10
My t-shirt drawer is full of terrible branded t-shirts which just sit under my jumpers or shirts. Um my favourite the one which is the best fit is I've got one from uh Tenocon, the Warframe Convention very comfy, very well made t-shirt.

Samuel
01:59:29
They make 'em for men your size at Tenocon. Yeah, they absolutely do. That's good. Um it's a shame I uh it's a shame we skipped over your other one because I had one more like Town Cryer gag in me. Um but uh the moment has passed now so I won't go back to it Matthew. Oh wow Um it was related to magazine redesigns but alas um it was fun while it lasted. I did last year yet another burn. It was a good bit, you know, while it lasted and that's okay. Um my last one, official Nintendo magazine should come back. I saw recently that Nintendo put a load of um print sort of uh catalogue stuff in future mags. And it was a very nicely made thing. Very like well put together. But it just begs the question of, you know, the Switch 2 is absolutely flying, even though I remember a few months ago those analysts saying that No one's gonna buy one because it's too expensive. And it just turned out not to be true. Um never bet against Nintendo is the lesson they're really. That's another truth. Um but But you know, why not just bring back the magazine? Why not get Future to make it? Why not get someone else to make it? I mean, it feels like it would probably do quite well. There's There's like a really long and interesting history of Nintendo games to tap into with a magazine these days and quite a lot of stuff you could do with it. A lot of these older games are on the virtual console or being re-released. Like There's kind of loads you could do with a Nintendo Mag now, and I feel like, you know, it's why not give it a try and see if it does well, you know? Um any thoughts on that, Matthew? Well, my last point is Endgamer should come back. Yeah, I guess.

Matthew
02:01:01
Okay.

Samuel
02:01:01
Well well fair enough, you know. It's uh I'm speaking to the authority on this. And there it is, Matthew. There are 50 truths about games journalism. Um, I feel like there should be some kind of NB at the end of this that goes 20% of these may not be true. Um, that's probably like important to add. And um are just like um rantings and ravings of um of two uh two men who are advancing in age and um whose brains have been cooked by games media.

Matthew
02:01:27
I thought that was a very good two to four hours of podcast.

Samuel
02:01:32
And on that note, uh we wrap up. So Next month we'll be back to the regular XXL um pop culture episode. We're gonna do um our favourite movies and TV shows of the year. Spoiler alert, I've only watched uh four TV shows this year, so I'll have to fill mine with some older TV shows I've been watching, Matthew. Um, but I will also do a list of the best older movies I watched this year, as I promised to do at the start of the year. Um, because I watched 143 films this year according to um Letterboxd so we'll discuss those. Um so yes, this is just a little temporary. We thought we'd do two XLs this month because of the anniversary of the podcast, so there it is. But Matthew, let's get out of here. People know where they can file us on social media. See you there, goodbye.

Matthew
02:02:13
Goodbye.
