Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew, our returning guest this week is uh little Jeremy Peel, who when sufficiently befriended, will sell you big box immersive sims out of the boot of his car. In many ways, uh Sheffield is the Jamaica of the North. Squirtle extended bit here, quite tortuous, Jeremy. But how are you doing? It's good to have you back.

Jeremy
00:46
Wow, that's good. It's really exciting when you hear the first third of a sentence and you're like, No that's giving me me no contextual clues as to where it's going. It's exciting stuff. I'm good, yeah. I'm uh I'm I'm happy, work is good, quite weirdly busy for a January, flew to Sweden. How are you?

Samuel
01:07
Yeah, not too bad, thank you. Um I'm sorry that I I had to subject you to a joke that only people who have recently finished Grand Theft Doctor Four would even get and who know about your um your love of the immersive sim. Um that's actually very specialist knowledge when I really think about it. And I forgot to um include Matthew's joke, which was uh he's killed people, he's sold people, he's smuggled people. It's Matthew Castle. I wrote that down and just forgot to say it. So that's uh Yeah, it's it's just not it's not gone very well so far. But um it's it's great to have you back, Jeremy, 'cause I think it's been has it been two years now since you've been on the podcast? It feels like it's been quite a long time. Like um Yeah. What was the last one that you did? I can't It wasn't Boulder's Gate, there was one after that. Uh 24 we did.

Jeremy
01:49
Was it an RPGs one? I can't remember which order we did them in. But I really feel like the uh the backpage Discord has sort of kept me alive in the minds of of listeners just through sort of memeing me. And uh interacting with me and speaking about me just sort of like kept me connected with the pod, uh, even when I've not been on it. So you know It's nice to have that uh Absolutely.

Samuel
02:11
It was our best intentions to have you on for um Indiana Jones uh last year, but we just the timings didn't end up working out, which was uh bummer but it's lovely to have you back for this episode which is three giant men play uh grand theft auto four um this is the latest in our series of gta episodes We revisited GTA 3 back in 2021. Last year we did um GTA Vice City on Patreon and then we did San Andreas for everyone. In between we made an episode on bully, which feels spiritually connected as part of the series, I think. And uh yeah, 2008's Grand Theft 84 is this uh this week's game. But Matthew, how are you doing? Because I realised I haven't given you a chance to speak yet.

Matthew
02:46
Oh yeah, no, I am doing absolutely fine. I've just about ten minutes ago finished watching quite a horny episode of Industry So um yeah, I'm just kinda Cooling off after that.

Samuel
03:00
I see, okay. So uh uh so yeah, looking forward to this. I mean it's uh it's a rich text GTA for it's a game that people have a lot of uh different opinions on it was at the time um different from what Rockstar had done on the PS2 generation and uh where people fell on that I think was um Well, I think it shaped a little bit what Rockstar did next and also was just a kinda key moment in the evolution of big budget games and how stories are told in these games, how worlds are presented. A really significant game. So Um we've all replayed it for this episode. Um Grand Theft Auto 4 is a story of a Serbian immigrant and former soldier Nikko Belek who has come to Liberty City, Rockstar's version of New York, in search of revenge against a man who betrayed his old friends back home. This is a man who cannot move past the ghosts of his old life and finds that killing and surviving is still the only thing he feels he is best at. Um it's a very much a American Dream Gone Wrong, classic kind of gangster story in some ways, but definitely does some things that video games have never seen before. This game represented Rockstar's transition into the HD era. If you don't count uh table tennis, that is a bit of table tennis erasure, I will admit. Um as such, uh the scope of the game was reduced from San Andreas' vast kind of kitchen sink approach to doing everything in an open world game. to a more stripped back and concentrated game experience, but uh yes, exponentially more detail as a result. So, got some background here before we get into the meat of the episode. Lads, by all means stop me at any point if you want to talk about this in more detail. But um Rockstar San Diego's rage engine, Rockstar Advanced Game Engine replaced renderware. The first game to use this was of course table tennis, like I say, to this day. Rockstar still uses Rage, GTA 6 uses Rage. Um the game took three and a half years to develop, which seemed a long time when they said that back then. Um Not these days. Um, and was estimated to have cost 100 million. Again, seemed like a lot of money back then for a book buster game, not so much these days. Um according to a Times interview with uh Leslie Benzes, that is the hundred million figure. It's just an estimate, but um it it was like uh it was a lot more than San Andreas, which I think they said was twelve million or something like that when we did that episode, Matthew. So uh Yeah, a lot more money on the table here. Okay, here's my first um attempt at um saying a name aloud that I'm gonna butcher for sure. Maybe Jeremy knows how to pronounce this guy's name. According to the game's technical director, um Obi Um Vermey, why didn't I look up how you pronounce this before I um before I said this aloud? Um Jeremy, have you had to pr say this guy's name aloud at any point in your in your s in your sort of history of doing covering these games.

Jeremy
05:39
You're on your own pal. I'm so sorry. I I I it's it's one of those names I've read his name so many times that it w hadn't even occurred to me that I don't know to say it because he's like one of the few who's quite eager to talk about his time at Rockstar, right? Um sometimes to the chagrin of Rockstar itself, I think.

Samuel
05:57
Yeah, it sounds like that. Um so yes, um Obi Verme, I've fucked that up twice now, um, but O B B E um V-E-R M E I J as Jeremy says, one of the few people who's really gone on the record talking about the making of these games, um Rockstars uh certainly then and you could argue now sort of technique of creating mystique around their game development so you never really get discussion of how these decisions are made. Um it's it's very much these stories are untold of how these games were created, but um this guy has been out there saying a lot more about it, which is um which is great. So according to him, the developers dropped a ton of game features from San Andreas to make GTA 4 feel truly next gen. This included stealth, character stats like weight and fitness, tanks, bikes, underwater swimming. Monster trucks and car modding. He says the missions were designed to suit the story. Previously, it had been the other way around with each GTA game. Incidentally, he left Rockstar North months later after the game shipped. Concerned that the games were getting darker, but he admits he was later proven wrong by GTA 5, which is very much a game that splits the difference between the San Andreas and GTA 4 approach. And uh the result of doing that, uh 220 million copies sold to date. So um fair play. Another great quote, well, about how game design was changing a rock star from his perspective After GTA 4, I decided I prefer smaller games. It doesn't have to be just me but working a smaller team because then you can actually come up with ideas and get them into a game. And that was just less and less the case with Rockstar. GTA 3 was a small team and everybody had their input by the t but by the time we were working on GTA 4. Our team was so big and most of the ideas came from New York, so it really felt like uh we were just implementing it with less and less freedom. And Uh he also says that the contraction of features from San Andreas was a reaction to San Andreas trying to too m to do to do too much. Another great quote here is um I actually didn't like GTA 4 that much uh when it was done because yes It does have the atmosphere, and I think Nico Belic is probably the best and most fleshed-out GTA character in the universe, but I think we had to sacrifice so much in terms of gameplay. Um if you've just played a little bit of GTA 4 recently, there's four missions, right? You could either follow that car or clear out this compound or follow this car with a time limit or assassinate the k this character or it's a mix of all those, but that's It's.

Jeremy
08:23
I sort of hate that he's pointed that out by the way. Until I read that in the panel's like uh yet when I did read it, I was like, oh fuck, yeah, he's right. No I'm seeing it. No unseeing it.

Samuel
08:34
Yeah, he is right. Once you you cannot unsee it once he's pointed that out, and I think it's um well, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but maybe it's something that uh feels more apparent when you're replaying it these days. So on the story which is darker and more serious in the PS2 games, Dan Hauser put that down to where he was at in the mid-2000s as the uh the the main writer of these games. Um so he told um Lex uh Fridman podcast guy who I hadn't really heard of, but this is recommended to me by listener Sam White as a as a source for this episode and it was super useful. So Hauser said, I had been living in New York for a few years and wasn't sure if I was happy. I was going through a lot of personal drama as usual. I was looking at some of GTA four again recently and it's really dark and I was like ah that's why I was single and miserable, and I wasn't sure I wanted to stay in America. According to Hauser as well, the hot coffee legal drama that kicked off after San Andreas um also cast a bit of a shadow over the um the period in which this game was created. Hauser says the company had this relative stability that was suddenly uncertain. Um there was more to the game's story than Hauser's personal drama though. Um the process, he says, was trying to find an underbelly to New York and capture an immigrant experience. Though I'm not entirely sure how accurate that immigrant experience was in 2008. I spent probably about a year travelling around with cops or meeting people wandering around New York. And uh howsa was uncertain of the game's tone. Is it gonna feel ridiculous? he said, and I remember being very scared because I thought it might be too much. It might feel over the top, but by the time they got uh some of the motion capture and animation back, he admitted that it worked and it it was working. Um so once we had those, he said, um we went, okay, now we've got comedy and tragedy with this character, now it's working. So, yeah, uh a bit more insight on Nico Balic then. Nico was hammered out in the process as being one step removed from the other character's ridiculousness. Hauser says this, combined with Roman being more Americanized and then forming a double act, helped to unlock this story of a Serbian immigrant getting caught up in a whirlwind of characters across this crime saga. when asked if Nico was his greatest character created in the GTA series. Halse had described him as the most innovative and morally defensible in some ways. Structurally, he might be too nice in some ways, he said in this interview. Ultimately, he loves Nico the most out of all the GTA characters he's created. He loved uh CJ2 in San Andreas, but credited that to uh young Melee's performance more than his writing. And uh Hauser did want to kill Nico at the end of the story of GT4. Ultimately the demands of an open world game meant that you had to carry on living. After all, the player um has to be able to run around uh Star Junction um popping off rockets at taxis and such. Can't do that, the character's dead and the game goes right. Time to leave now. Killing all those birds. Yeah. Time to turn the game off now. Um no more, no more fun. So instead, uh spoiler alert for Red Dead Redemption, if you've not played that, just um go forward about 30 seconds. Uh John Marston in that game had the pleasure of being the first HD era rockstow rockstar hero to bite it instead.

Matthew
11:37
I I like that there was spoiler warning there because i it you can only have been spoiling one thing. It is true. Unlike spoiler warning, so skip that

Jeremy
11:50
Imagine how surprising it would be if you're like unlike of course Bully, which ended with the tragic death of Jimmy.

Samuel
11:56
Jimmy Hopkins uh beaten to death by the headmaster in a very dark twist to the end of that game. Okay, yeah, that is um a bit of a spoiler but I don't know, people about 16 years by now. It's one of the most famous moments of any video game. I guess like before we get into the game itself then, anything to pull out of the makey of there, Jeremy? I'll start with you.

Jeremy
12:15
Yeah, th I I also listened to that um Lex Friedman interview which was really good even though Dostoevsky came up. A little more than I was expecting for unclear reasons. Ye And the Roman Empire. I I mean, I I say it only 'cause I'm a little jealous of him bagging that interview to be honest. Um but yeah it's really is so interesting to hear Dunhauser talk about it in those terms because You know, it feels like part of GTA's DNA is that like outsider perspective on America, you know, whether it's like Scottish perspective or Rockstar North or you know, the houses themselves who are English and like but they've never done an explicit story of the protagonist comes from outside America until now. But they also did Chinatown wars around this time, right? So it seems like something they were really invested in and and interested in in trying to do. Even though I d I can't imagine you make either of those games now and not have anybody from the relevant ethnic backgrounds involved, like that feels like a very sort of two thousand and eight way to do it.

Samuel
13:20
Um definitely. It's it's funny, that that interview, Jeremy, uh everything you said was really insightful, but I almost feel like I know this game so well. I could have guessed that that was how Hauser felt about the entire thing. Like I would have guessed that Nico was his favourite c creation ever. I would have guessed that it it was the it's a character very much created from feeling like a being an outsider in a city like New York in your 30s. and being in a position where you have to make decisions. I can f uh on this replay I could really feel that in the text of the game. And also the idea of like having to invent um an a sort of like immigrant sort of culture to the city that maybe doesn't exist in the form that the game presents it like that It that part of the game is I don't think it's a problem that it doesn't feel authentic, but I would say it doesn't really feel like it's based on reality. So I did think it was really interesting just to hear him talk about it. But yeah, with this game specifically, his observations I was like Oh yeah, I feel I kind of feel like I knew all that in my bones and and now I'm just having it confirmed, you know. It was a bit of a weird experience. Um, Matthew, how about you? Anything to pull out from the making of this game.

Matthew
14:29
Did it in that interview, did he talk at all about Red Dead Redemption and where that fits into it? Because the it's kind of an interesting thing to put alongside GTA in terms of their desire to tell slightly more s serious stories or deal with more morally compromised characters. And yeah, I'm just i interested if GTA sets some on the path to Red Dead Redemption or You know, they don't see any connective tissues because at the heart of this game is is a tension between a desire to do something new and say something new and maybe the desire to follow what people know t GTA to be in terms of this like silly sort of slightly more frivolous or its comic tone. So Yeah, I wish I'd listened to this interview. I'd I'd have had s something more valuable to say.

Jeremy
15:31
to do that. Like you you can't go from San Andreas to Red Dead Redemption. And even having written or co-written GTA 4, it sounded like Hauser spent a lot of time just nailing the voice of Red Dead Redemption. Like he didn't want it to sound corny and sort of old timey, but he didn't want it to sound too modern either and like just spent a long time just sort of workshopping and sort of getting into the the right narrative mode to do it. So it sounded like, yeah, like you don't get that without GTA 4, but even then it was kind of a another level up in a sense.

Samuel
16:08
He he he did make it sound like they were being written very close together. And I don't know if you got this as well, Jeremy. He made it sound like Red Dead was much more of a two-hander with Christian Cantomessa on that game. Um whereas it Yeah, G24 does have another right earth. Yeah, it sounded like There was maybe a bit more share duties on Red Dead. Did you get that idea?

Jeremy
16:28
Yeah, and I remember now that he'd said you know, it it makes complete sense that GTA 4 is a lonely man in a city's game. Uh and that but he said that when he was writing Red Dead Redemption his his now wife was pregnant for the first time. So then that was sort of changing his perspective on on life and the things he wanted to to write about um which yeah. It it feels like both of those games in their own way are reflective of those different stages of life.

Samuel
16:58
Yeah. Um so that's that's definitely um apparent in the uh in the stories of those games for sure. Yeah, it's interesting 'cause his co-writer on GTA four was someone who's no people don't know much about this guy, Rupert Humphreys, but I remember being told by Rockstar PR that he's like 20 he was like 23 or something when this game came out and like a wonder kid and that was kinda how that's all I ever heard about him from Rockstar was that like he was sort of this genius kid. That was all they ever told me about him. And I just like just two credited writers, but he also made it Sam Matthew in that um in that episode of the pot that podcast was that the size of the script was just like towering above what they had for um for San Andreas. It was just such a step up in the the volume of what they were creating and um yeah there definitely has to be a stepping stone game between um between San Andreas and everything that comes after for Rockstar really. But uh Yeah, interesting. And um I actually really like the frankness of pointing out the um the limited mission types based on like this is what we could make with the the canvas that we drew because Everyone at this time was trying to figure out how to do HD games, right? I mean it famously took Square Enix like I think about three years longer than everyone expected to make uh Final Fantasy XIII. But it was like challenging in terms of the man hours needed to make a HD game. It was just something else from what the the PS2 era was. So um Okay, so Matthew, we've done these as we've done these episodes on GTA, I think what defines the series beyond its basic mechanics is that escalating ambition between each game and the form that that takes. Vice City that was period detail and extra gameplay features and San Andreas it was making the canvas unimaginably large. GT4, the ambition is different, it's a smaller game, but the level of detail is magnified And even though some serious stuff happens in San Andreas, the tone here is much more adult, it's reaching for something more mature. How do you define the difference between what San Andreas was trying to achieve and this.

Matthew
19:00
Oh, you kind of sort of just describe some of it there. You know, to me it's s it is all about fidelity. and entering the H D era and realizing that you can show so much more and so you need to show so much more and that it needs to feel like a more believable place. I mean I think the PS2 games, replaying them for the podcast last year, you know, they they feel like a sort of They got the shape of a place, you know, they've got like a you know, maybe like a tone or a vibe. Um but this kind of is the place, you know, it isn't it isn't just that very broad sketch and It's ki wa it it kind of s struck me as odd actually w you know, hearing you talk about people saying or this idea that it is um a step back compared to San Andreas in terms of pure featurelist. Because that might be true, but I'd say the the overwhelming kind of richness of that city and the actual experience of like living and being in it is so much more sophisticated and complex that I never once thought Oh, this is thin compared to San Andreas or where is all that stuff? Like this does feel next gen to me, you know, at the time and now I can still see it. you know, compared to some of the open world games that get made now even. Like the the ambition of it. You know, so that yeah, and that but I'd also say that f that fidelity, you know, it isn't just about a world and what it looks like and its you know gameplay mechanics, but there is a a a social and psychological fidelity to it which just didn't exist in these games before. you know, how people behave with each other, what motivates them, what's going on inside them, you know, the idea that there's like a sort of inter interiority. Interiority? Is that right? Yeah, that's correct.

Jeremy
20:56
Some somewhere within the region of the correct number of vowels. Yeah, it feels right.

Matthew
21:02
You know, that's I don't know, I'd I'd say that's like a vastly more complicated business, pulling off that kind of thing. So yeah, it's it's just you know, it may not be you know, every bit of flamboyant whimsy, but what is there is is sketched in such fine detail that it's I don't know, it's it It's absolutely massive leap to me. Yeah.

Samuel
21:25
What you're saying is completely true, but do you think that for the core audience of GTA, that's quite a leap of trust to get them to understand that no we have no Area fifty one here. Yeah. Um, or like um jet packs, but uh the deep but the detail and the world like is that trusting that particular era of audience a bit too much?

Matthew
21:48
Maybe, but I'd I'd say like like fundamentally at the core of GTA the the sick fantasy that it originally sold to everyone was you're in a place you can steal a car and you can do damage to the people around you and in representing that in a very realistic way, you know, however dark a sentiment it may be you know, that is at the heart of this. I think that's the thing that that made everyone that caught everyone's attention to begin with with the series. Even if you're playing the two D one. It's the idea of, oh, I've stolen this car and I've got it. So that that that experience is so much more uh delicate and detailed here, you know, from the car handling to the physics, I mean everything in this game. The act of hurting someone in this game is so realistic compared to what came before. I don't know, I think that's enough. Like I you know, we'll get into when we first played it, but I can remember you know, playing this just as a GTA fan and thinking like, wow, that is that is next level the stuff that I was doing before. Uh and that's enough to go, you know, I'm not like, where's my jetpack? Um so but I don't know. I mean I'm t d uh do you feel differently?

Jeremy
23:02
Yeah, I I know I I'm glad to hear you like talk about the felt fidelity in relation to the tone so much 'cause I really came down on that same idea of like oh that this fidelity demanded a different tone. It's like in Vice City everybody shouts. Like it's a cartoon. Like the whole game though the you know, the PS2 games, they're all shouting in a sense like all the time. And yeah and then yeah, you get to this where it seems pretty clear they they develop the sort of the the graphical, the visual technology and we're like, okay We have to do something different with this because it it no longer makes sense. Otherwise, like the the storytelling has to be smaller and more intimate because we have this you know, even where where you just start in the in the world in in Hove Beach, like I found myself kinda like walking out and and getting into a little routine of like going round the corner to that little uh diner that looks like a sort of seventies sci-fi space age like Chromot thing and just like listening to the train like it I think it's so good that they start you like directly under the train tracks. It feels so oppressive and so uh so densely urban and I like if I'm like I modified my GTA behavior in this game like significantly because of how different it felt like I stole way fewer cars than I do a GTA online. Like I would like if there was one by the side of the road within reachable distance, I would go for that one instead because it just felt like Nico would go for the choir option. You know, like and I I feel like this is how you get to like Ellen Noir and that sort of almost What I really love about that game and this one to a slightly lesser degree is like you feel compelled to roleplay the character in the city. Like there is no There is no world in which Nico Bellick stands on a rooftop and shoots everyone he can just in a in an attempt to get to five stars to see what's going on. Oh, he does in my world.

Matthew
25:10
In my world he goes into a hospital where there are people in hospital beds and he shoots them in the head in their bed.

Jeremy
25:24
into his personality just completely break again.

Matthew
25:26
He just kills a load of people in the hospital and then goes and watches Ricky Gervais. It's a mad life.

Samuel
25:32
That's what you did back in the 2000s, you know? It's just accurate portrayal of life. I guess then Jeremy, like you hint at it there, but what do you identify as the difference between what Rockstar tried to achieve in the PS2 GTAs versus what they were What that they were reaching for with Grand Theft Oi 4.

Jeremy
25:48
It's it's um it's mood driven, isn't it? I think is the is the difference. I don't know, maybe that's not entirely fair because you know like obviously people really remember uh in Vice City like the lighting, the music, the you know, the Hawaiian shirts, like the era. And similarly in San San Andreas, it's the sort of West Coast gangster thing which is really the most kind of vivid part, but it feels like the complete player freedom is is sort of in the back seat. You fly a helicopter twice in this game, right? Like somebody developed an incredibly detailed uh like helicopter uh flight model for this game and I like I don't even know where I'd go to use it again in the game. It it just doesn't feel like it quite um belongs in the same way and it's so it's so committed to like in contrast to San Andreas which you know so much of it is countryside and you like the feel of being so you know densely in it in an urban space is g in GTA 4 is completely different. There's about like 10 meters of beach in the entire place. They have that amazing like FOV trick where you look up at the skyscrapers and it it makes the game makes it feel taller, like it sort of simulates like the overwhelm of being in New York, I presume. And uh I guess you can kind of feel that like, oh yeah, Rockstar HQ is in New York and they've they've lived there for a long time, but at this point in a very specific feels that they want to to get into the game.

Samuel
27:27
Yeah, it's um it just sort of arrives at this quite interesting moment in games where it felt like everyone was trying to figure out what grown up looks like. It's a very sincere game in terms of its ambition, I think. It's you know, it wants to tell a weighty story. It wants to give you a real sort of simulated world. It is like not like, you know, we've sort of uh added a chain gun that fires out like dildos or something like that, which is definitely one direction you could have seen GTA going in after San Andreas. And certainly when I was on Play Magazine, they came up with like their idea of what uh the next Grand Theft Auto game should be. It was called GTA Land of the Free Um and you could go to space in it in a space rocket. And I think that that's definitely like there is definitely a lower fidelity route that GTA could have gone down where it is sort of a bit It is a bit more of that in that vein, perhaps not going to space, but still. And yeah, it is it's around the time of Bioshock and Mass Effect, um, you know, in this some commonality with those games as well, which we'll we'll which we'll get into. Um so I did want to talk a bit about the hype cycle of this game. Um the one thing I do remember is it was meant to come out in two thousand seven and got delayed to to two thousand eight. I was in media when this happened. This I was two days into being on Play Magazine when the first trailer for GTA 4 dropped in March 2007. So I was I was there. I went on a uh a uh one of the exclusive sort of beats they did the first like proper look at the gameplay in it. I saw like two of the missions play out and some of the open world. I went to New York, um Rockstar and did that. A po a thing I've talked about in the podcast before. Um and I wrote Nico Belic fanfiction um as read out on episode one hundred of this podcast and I will not revisit that today. Um I've pa I've paid the price for that already. Um I was curious what each of you remember about the hype cycle for this game. Matthew, I'll start with you.

Matthew
29:20
Yeah, I I was enjoying it more as a punter than anything else. You know, I I am at the height of my staff writer mania on Endgamer and you know, we're all going all in on, you know, Married Galaxy in two thousand and seven and then I just remember every time anything GTA happened there'd be a just a flurry of activity from Xbox World. um three sixty would just kick off and, you know, you you could hear them you know, this was their Mario and you could hear their excitement and everyone kind of ripping these things apart. But I I honestly had quite a quite a casual relationship with it. I just I didn't really have the mental bandwidth to be endlessly thinking about games that I wasn't really writing about. Um but yeah, I as we got closer to release though, I I just I became properly obsessed with the idea of playing it and it coming into the office and there be being people in the office who'd seen it and I think I became quite irritating to anyone who got to review it, trying to get them to tell me about it and Um so yeah, it was st I don't know, pretty like uh I I I don't think I've ever been able to cover a a rock star game. As a journalist, really? Apart, you know, c aside from like Chinatown Wars, but none of the biggies. So yeah, I've only ever enjoyed them as just a a very enthusiastic customer who appreciated uh all the the mad previews and reviews and whatnot that um you know people like you on play wrote.

Samuel
30:51
I felt absurd pressure writing about this game because I think that's when because we had the exclusive that first time, it was a bit like oh fuck and it was W Something like twelve pages or ten pages or something like that I had to write in about I don't know in about six hours it was a ridiculous sort of deadline. It was one of those ones. Like I landed on the Thursday and then had to write it on the Friday basically and it went to press before like six o'clock on the Friday. It was something like that that happened and Yeah and when I reviewed it as well, I just felt a bit like I felt very sort of like, oh shit, this is sort of the the future of get video games right here. It felt it really felt like that in the the three sixty PS3 era where the first time I mentioned this before, but the first time I saw like Motor Storm when I had my interview on Play Magazine and being like, I've never seen a game look like that before. Like it's I'm looking at something I've never seen before. And you know, the idea of Kotor going into Mass Effect or, you know, seeing a big daddy in Bioshock for the first time. It was or like um what they what Bungie could do in Halo Three or what Gears of War could do in terms of fidelity, detail of like the different characters, technical excellence with the shooting, a type of shooting you'd never seen before. It just felt like video games were changing very quickly and that the the order is being disrupted where like I also talked about this before but um the idea of like the Japanese PS2 games that really define my taste on that platform I was just paying so much more attention to Western games because they felt like they were at the center of everything. Whether you think that's fair or not, like historically, certainly in that moment covering them, it felt it felt like that. And GTA 4 was the game. um of these games. So that's what I remember about covering it. I just remember feeling like slightly crushed by it, the pressure of it and just feeling like I gotta do this monumental thing justice. Um Jeremy, what do you remember about the hype cycle of GTA four as a punter?

Jeremy
32:48
Yeah, it was it was before I entered the industry and uh uh weirdly I guess the point in my life where I was kind of most detached from from games media and and following that stuff. But then like I I went to Uni in 2008, got my first games co console, the 360, you know, my kind of first ports of call were Bioshock and Mass Effect and Fallout 3, Mirror's Edge. Um even then like my friend down the hall had a copy of GTA 4. So it was it was kind of like Biosmosis, it was just kind of there. But yeah, it's it's really interesting to think of it in that context. Like at the time GTA seemed, you know, well s kind of set apart. Like Rockstar have always done things their own way, but with distance, you look at it and you're like, oh yeah, like of course they were influenced by the fact that Bioware RPGs were on console now and a big deal. It's like choice and consequence entering GTA and you know the sort of like the bleaker palette of a of a gears. Like you can see that stuff actually did seep in to to GTA at that point.

Samuel
33:58
Yeah, for sure. I wonder what the combat in this game would have looked like with no Gears of War. Because you think about the time frame is It's late 2006 Gears of War. This game is meant to come out in 2007, but comes out about 18 months after Gears ultimately. And it What is it more like the the sort of PS2 GTAs in terms of how the gunplay works? Like the entire rhythm of it is ultimately based on cover shooting. So Yeah, um I think I definitely think you're right, Jeremy. It feels like it's part of a of a moment, um, even though it is very singular versus the other GTAs. Um yeah, so uh really like um a a huge deal when it came out and I suppose I'll ask what you each made of GT4 when it did release. Matthew, what do you remember about your first experience playing it

Matthew
34:46
Rich Stanton had a copy. Maybe this was pre-release and he bought it round to our crappy little flat and got to taste like an hour of it playing that evening just very casually driving around and thinking like oh my god I've just I've never seen anything like this before. It's just looks incredible. The thing I was obsessed with once I finally got it was the um the physics of it and that was it the euphoria engine it used for behaviour, like how bodies behaved in terms of falling over, but also the idea that characters had a almost like a will to live or a will you know, that they'd like hold on to things and they could grip things and they could express themselves through physics and I uh don't think I made much progress in the the campaign of this because I in that opening area, you know, not leaving the first island for days and days and days because I was just terrorizing people endlessly and Um, you know, m maybe it just bought out the kind of teenager in me, you know, who liked these games when when he was younger. But yeah, driving around pushing people downstairs to see them like how realistically they tumble. Driving really fast into objects to see Mika go through the windscreen and bounce around. Like that stuff I'd never seen anything like it. I don't really think I've seen any physics in games which since then which have which have like taken that kind of leap. Even in the the subsequent Rockstar games, you know, it feels like of you know, a very similar set of tricks that those games are doing and I was just amazing. I mean I really played this game like an asshole back then, playing it for this replay where I was not like strictly mainlining it, but I really just did the central missions that it it was kinda like driving through all these places and having fond memories of like That's where I pushed like a hundred old ladies down some stairs just to see each one of them tumble individually like a beautiful broken snowflake. Um Yeah. Um so But every time you do it It's different. Like nothing ever repeats in this game. It's that's it's magic, that trick.

Jeremy
37:12
Your honor.

Samuel
37:14
It's weird because I do rem you know, I know that GTA 5 has like Fun physics as well, but there's something about Yeah. This game's physics that is like completely unique to this game. It's just F Yeah, it's just this world of real living people trying to get but basically baby stepsing their way through this world while you cause absolute terror in any way you can. And The idea that it's simulating that while also being as hyper-detailed as it is is still one of the things that's really impressive about it. Um Jeremy, what did you make uh of GTA for it? What did you make of it when you first played it?

Jeremy
37:51
Yeah, I think I I Similarly like the physics really made an impression on me. I distinctly remember the first time Nico went through the windscreen because I hadn't taken a corner properly and being so shocked. That resort. But like in terms of like I I know you think this way, Matthew, because you've talked about it on the podcast before, but like, you know, writers Um you two probably uh do you do as well, probably Samuel, but like writers look for metaphors in in games as they're playing 'em and that the driving physics of this game is so much like you know, it's like Is it's it's a game about a guy who's trying to turn a corner basically, right? But he's got too much momentum b behind him from his past terrible decisions and so he can't quite he can't quite turn like That is what this game is about. And that is the quintessential like opening GTA 4 experiences going oh shit like I'm gonna have to take a really different approach to driving in this game.

Samuel
38:52
Yeah, it's uh uh yeah, it's I'd like to get into the That is really good. Yeah. Well done Jeremy. I saw you're the best.

Jeremy
38:59
Um Oh I've I've got a a a way more throwaway uh anecdote from initially playing it as well, which is trying the multiplayer. And the first kill I got I achievement popped up. You know, early days of owning a 360, I was like, oh, that's very exciting. And it was you have killed a rockstar developer. And I loved that. And I I sort of dined out on it for years. And eventually I looked at the achievement and it said, this is a viral achievement. And what that means apparently is Anyone who gets it, so if somebody kills a rock star developer, if another player then kills that player, they also get that achievement, and so on and so on. So like the number of players who have it grows exponentially. So I think by the time I played it, loads of people had that that virus, as it were. So I shot someone and then went around for 10 years believing I'd managed to haphazardly kill a rockstar developer on my first day in GTA Core. You threw him Wolotov at OB. Yeah. Just headshot of mostly Bunsies.

Samuel
40:09
When you leave the um The Xbox on. It gives you all the achievements you don't have yet. And there are so many fucking multiplayer achievements in this that no one will ever get because you cannot play it online now. And that is That's very 2008, the idea of gating a load of your Cheevos um behind the multiplayer. Um I'd even put a section in the mul about the multiplayer into this um episode actually, but uh maybe we will talk come back to it towards the end. But Um my um experience of playing it, I reviewed this at Rockstar's headquarters in London. Um first two uh first two days, absolutely fine. Third day. uh the most hungover I've ever been in my life. Um didn't finish it, um, was uh 20 years old and very irresponsible. And my editor should have told me off really. But um I got to definitely got to Aldeny and definitely got to the latter end of the Pegarino missions, which is quite far, but um in retrospect the ending is kind of like pretty significant to understanding what the full the full story of the game is. So a bit of a blunder, but I think I still kind of got the idea from that experience. Um and I actually think three days is quite hard to finish this game.

Jeremy
41:15
It's taken me I was gonna say that is not enough. But particularly so as you get towards the end and the missions get harder and you end up repeating more of them, you must have been pretty stressed out about that.

Samuel
41:25
I was, especially 'cause the room that I was in with John Denton was completely dark. And that combined with uh The hangover was starting to give it a bit of the old um psychological terror, I would say. Um I was like, I just wanna be home in Bournemouth in my terrible underground flat. That was kinda how I was feeling at that moment, I think. Yeah.

Jeremy
41:45
Um You were like one of the Pegarinos guys. When is there a helicopter? They're had to get me.

Samuel
41:50
Yeah, so it was um that was a bit strange, but then I've I've played through this twice now when I was. When um well I guess three times if you count that review playthrough. I played through it on PS3 and then I played through it again on 360 about a year later. Um definitely a key game for me. Yeah, I really I really loved it and I did love how different it was to uh to uh the previous GTAs and also you know having been to New York for that trip, I just couldn't help but be amazed by the way in which it rendered the city that I just experienced for forty eight hours of my first ever international press trip. And yes there is a novelty to that when you're a new games journalist and you cannot afford to go on holiday and You are taken somewhere exciting on the publisher's dime. I think that it was definitely a significant experience. I've told stories about that trip on this podcast before. um some of which are too profane to repeat um in front of Jeremy. Um but yeah it was um and so it just meant that when I was playing it and going through Star Junction and looking at how they'd rendered Times Square or ha how they'd brought like the flat iron building to life or how they made like the silhouette of the Statue of Liberty look in the distance and um statue of happiness, sorry. And just capturing those details. It was it was amazing. And I, you know, I got into some quite heated arguments with colleagues about it who felt like I remember one guy who I worked with on one magazine. him making a big deal about how much he preferred Saints Throw two, which came out later that year, and how he thought he he was like games are toys and, you know, I think he was offended by the game having ideas above its station. And then it wasn't this silly sandbox thing. And I took myself far too seriously. These are the kind of conversations I'd never have now. If someone came up to me, real life, if someone says to me, I like GTF or shit, actually, I'd be like. Okay, and then I'll just turn around and talk to someone else. I'm like, you can you have you have that my guy, but back in the day I would have been like fiercely debating it But these days who's got the fucking energy? You know, we've all lived through a fucking pandemic. I ain't arguing about GT4 anymore with some randos. So yeah, that was that was um the sort of meat of it really. But I I do think there is something to the The fact that GTA 4 did sell well, it sold 25 million copies, it was the best-selling GTA. I think there is a reason that GTA 5 sold 220 million and not this one. Like it is it is a very dark game in terms of its story. It is limited in its types of missions and I do think that there is a s a certain type of player who might have been impressed by what this is, but maybe w did want something more in the in the San Andreas Mole, something that you could Play infinitely and just have basically this jar of ants to shake and see see what happens. It's a You you you can have a lot of fun with the physics of this game, but there are only so many things you can do post-game, for example. And GTA V is arguably a limitless game to enjoy post-game, especially when you factor in GTA online. So let's come to what holds up well about this game now, revisiting it in 2026. Matthew, why don't you kick us off?

Matthew
44:50
I think this is gonna sound like a criticism, but it's not. I think there are fewer standout missions than in previous GTAs, but I think everything is of a more like general quality, I think it's really consistent by GTA standards. Maybe I'm feeling that because we've just played Vice City and San Andreas, which are all over the place quality-wise of individual missions. Where here, okay, maybe yes, they do draw from, you know, quite a limited sort of palette of moves to actually construct what they are, but the general experience of that I think is i i it's quite smooth, there is an escalation in difficulty, um, you know, in there's nothing uh too outrageous or flamboyant to make the rest of it l you know, sort of pale by comparison. Uh and I I don't I I and maybe that's just cause this is the first time I've sat there and just played all the missions through quite quickly and not stopped to execute people in a hospital every couple of hours. So it is a slightly different perspective on it. And I was I don't know, I was quite impressed by that.

Samuel
45:55
Yeah, that is um I I like that as a as a sort of general note on consistency because it does have difficulty spikes, but it has nothing like Espresso to go or that bullshit ice cream uh truck mission in Vice City, like nothing even vaguely in that mold. Or the terrible turret mission in um that you do for Zero and San Andreas. So they Fixed for the re-release because they knew it was terrible. Like there's nothing like that in GT4. It is on three um when you play the three sixty version on Xbox, it is intact from what it was. So it's not like it's been updated. So you can see the advances they made over over the previous games in that respect. Jeremy, how about you? What's something about this that holds up well for you in uh 2026?

Jeremy
46:39
uh quite a bit better than I expected it to. I didn't even particularly remember getting on that well with it at the time. But now I'm like, oh yeah, this is actually like the foundations of of why GTA 5 works in that respect. I think I really like the marriage of like the auto aim which is, you know, has always been a part of GTA in some form with manual control, like locking onto someone and then just sort of gently easing up the right stick to get a headshot, like that never stops being fun. Um yeah that like the driving still is is really good. Like I'm surprised that as many people embraced it as they did. Like it sort of pushes it along the spectrum towards like a Mafia 2 and like you know, you got bite mud runner at the far end of that spectrum. Like it's obviously not that far, but it is a like a little way along it. Particularly with the the vehicles that you're driving at the beginning of the game are quite kind of sluggish but like It's so engrossing. Like a a car chase in this game is quite slow by comparison to to one in the in the um you know the PS2 era. But it's so like You're really thinking hard about that kind of like hazard perception of like it's like oh I'm not gonna they've unexpectedly turned down an alleyway. I'm not gonna take that corner in time, but I'm already moving in this general direction because I'm gonna slip between those lump posts and I'm gonna head them off over here like oh it's so good chef's kiss stuff

Samuel
48:09
I'd expect that from a driver sicko like you.

Jeremy
48:12
Yeah. Of course I picked up the uh the Sabre GT that looks exactly like the car in uh Driver San Francisco right near the end of the game. Um Uh but yeah like and atmospherically it's just so um so um effective still. Like I I think about sort of eight hours into playing this this time through I was like I'm gonna go and watch The Warriors because I knew that it's like it's an important film to Rockstar because they made an adaptation of it. But I could just kind of feel it's like I think I know where this vibe is. is coming from like those Walter Hill directed films in the late seventies which like I think of as night movies. I probably nicked that term from somewhere, but like um and sure enough like you watch the opening of the Warriors and it's right there like Coney Island, that Ferris wheel in the dark, and then straight away you're on the train to uh I guess it's it's Central Park right in that film. And um and like there is a lot it it obviously demands a little patience but like there is a lot to be gained, uh, atmospherically in this game by going, I'm gonna take the train to this next mission and just listen to the thing and just like look at the world as it goes by and um there aren't many older open worlds that I would sort of trust to To to show me a good time in that quiet way.

Samuel
49:40
Yeah. I mean loads to loads to pull out there. Like the um The driving is interesting because I do think that every sharp turn is like an event. Like it's here we go, lads. Like bracelet impact. Like um That bit in the Simpsons where the school bus's brakes like aren't working and all the kids have to like sort of reach out the windows with their like jackets and try and bring the car to a the bus to a stop. That's how I feel going into every corner. It's like, let's do or die, lads. Here we fucking go. Let's see what happens and sort of pulling that off and being like, oh that was amazing. That was amazing driving that I did that. I think I do personally feel that the the acceleration when you first get in a vehicle, I would maybe increase that by like 10% on all cars. Like it's Sometimes you just start driving, hit something, and you're meant to be chasing after someone, and you can just see them getting away, and the game game warns you you're getting there getting away, and I'm like I feel like I'm in a proper fucking sort of I'm in like um playing a in a car from the original Mafia on PC.

Jeremy
50:40
Or as an alternate choice, they keep the acceleration as it is, but they put in the winch from Mudrunner. If you just connect a lamppost and pull yourself to hell.

Samuel
50:49
I love that. I think I agree with you about the shooting. I do think it lacks the technical excellence of Gears of War, which was so readable at the t even at the time. Like how the the guns were really chunky. The enemies were really chunky and it was really obvious when like bullets were supposed to hit enemies and there was like a of visibility to it. You had so much more information to work with than this game gives you. This is much more like I have no idea if this bullet's gonna hit him. I'll crouch and see if that that will increase the chances of it hitting him, but Ultimately, it feels like there are many dice rolls going on behind the scenes as to whether this bullet will hit. However, I think it comes back to the physics being so good in this game. It's just like the way enemies kind of crumple over and just the How visceral a headshot feels. Like it's really like quite nasty, but very satisfying. And then when you shoot someone, they just go tumbling down the stairs afterwards. Like there's Something uh you know, the kind of like puppet theatre nature of the shootouts in this game just makes it very um very exciting still. And again, like it's not uh playing GTA 5 is not exactly like this because Even though again it has has physics, it's just this game is just so much more pronounced with it. It's like the physics slider is always turned up to a hundred and fifty percent in this game.

Jeremy
52:07
If you haven't headshotted someone, like you've you've knocked down one enemy, you shot them in the arm, they've dropped. You're like, okay, I've got a second to turn and shoot this other guy. Meanwhile this poor mobster's like getting up to his knees and pushing himself up and you turn back and hit him again like there's a really weird like very physics driven rhythm to that.

Samuel
52:27
Yeah. And the sort of choice that the game sort of gives you when you got guys down to like one bar of health, they start limping away and they're like technically dead. You don't have to kill them to complete the mission. But then You as a player can decide, am I just gonna execute this man who's hobbling away? Um, basically trying to trying to like have a second chance at life, and I'm just like Nah, I'm just gonna put a bullet in your back because it's funny. Like it's all this kind of stuff they couldn't do on the PS2. All that stuff still holds up super, super well. And yeah, it just means there's like a Maybe not a rhythm as such, but just uh the f the visual sort of like theatrics of the of the shooting is still yeah, it's really particular to this game. Um I have more to say on presentation, Matthew, but I wanted to ask you if there was anything else that you thought held held up well about this game.

Matthew
53:13
How complete it all feels, the the idea that the things you can interact with you know you can interact with them fully so like there's a taxi and you can whistle for a taxi and it as long as it hasn't got a passenger in it will pull over and then you can get in and give it instructions And there'll be like banter with the taxi driver, or there's that absolutely um the brilliant guy you can like call from your own cab firm Who always is like super sort of m Mardy about having to give a new lifts around and uh that's yeah, but like stuff like that. The idea that there's like probably hundreds, if not thousands, of lines of dialogue. for if you choose to get into a taxi. Um and that level of yes that that attention to detail or like, you know, if you go on the internet all the websites on the browser are websites and probably have multiple pages and they've got some quite broad comic writing in them, admittedly, but it it it is there and It just felt like whatever it lets you do, they they make sure there's there's actually something to do and see there or, you know, going to see all those stage shows and they're all like you know, motion captured performers and it that that stuff's absolutely crazy. You know you know, on that kind of like, you know, microscopic scale of when you zoom right in, but then yeah, when you zoom out, the atmosphere of the place and The way they capture light and weather in this city, like it it can look like a million different places, which is actually like very true of wherever you live. You know, on a bright sunny day the vibe of a city, you know, the vibe of Bath is so different to when it's overcast and it's just sort of like nothing, you know, and it's it's very sort of you know, sad and melancholic, but also just sort of cold and unfeeling, and I can't think of another game where, just at different times of day or different trips across the bridge, I've been like, Wow, this place just it looks so different today. Which is something I often think when I walk to work and that's pretty amazing.

Samuel
55:17
Yeah, I think that is probably a good chance for to talk about the presentation some more. Like I do think that the lighting Is amazing in this. Like it I think it still looks fantastic. And I think that the backwards compatible version on Xbox, even though it's in 720p, It's got this kind of like it's this weird conta contradiction about this game where like the less detail you can make out, the more beautiful it is. Like there is a slightly watercolourish feel to the way that trees work in this game, for example. Um a lot of the foliage, if you look it up close, it's actually not dissimilar from the PS2 where it's like flat, like there's plants that are just like the look like two bits of cardboard put together basically. But I don't think that matters because to just drive past like Bits of the City does look like of sort of watercolour painting going past and then somehow you can be like twenty hours into this game and you you see a combination of like day and weather that you've never seen before. Or you're in an area of the city where you've not seen like you forget what it looks like when it rains in Star Junction, for example, you know? Or what it feels like being on um being on the coast on a very still um night as the sun goes down and just looking at it. And like the idea that a game can be eighteen years old, that there can be so many open world games that have come out in its wake and Still the choices made with the art direction have just helped it really sort of stand the test of time in this very particular way. And so I think it's still absolutely breathtaking. There were so many moments I just wanted to stop and take screenshots, and indeed I did, and I ambushed my blue sky followers with those screenshots um several times throughout. But Yeah, an absolutely amazing looking game and I think it just for for it to stand up in the way that it does all these years later, just affirms that Rockstar made all the right choices in the moment, you know, um for th of the things that they focused on. Um they just made a game that was built to last, even if it wasn't necessarily an open world game that you would um play forever in the way that you would with GTA five. Jeremy, is there anything else you wanted to highlight as um what holds up well from this game?

Jeremy
57:27
Hm I mean I I completely agree on the the visuals front. I I played it on PC and I had all all the detail turned up except for the like um uh the distance of detail when stuff popped in and at what level detail that like the sweet spot for that seemed to be like fifty rather than a hundred. Like as you say it's kind of like almost like sort of impressionistic backdrops are just just so um so beautiful and so like something about the slight sort of decoloration of it Rather than it feeling like, oh, you know, sort of like Gears Pastige, it almost feels like, yeah, this is kind of like New York or Liberty City as Nico sees it. Like it almost feels like to if you were to see it through Roman's eyes it would be colored differently. You know, like because of it is it is the Nico's slight disdain, but also kind of appreciation in a in a sort of a kind of sad beauty is is what the world looks like in this game.

Samuel
58:28
Yeah, that is the that is the funny thing. There are times when it does look like Gears of Wars colour palette, you know, but it's it's deliberately so But then there are other times where it's the most vividly colourful game that released on an Xbox outside of Mirror's Edge, you know? Um it's the colour difference can be stark and it's just amazing that the game contains all those um multitudes in terms of presentation. Um I really think that is key to its you know, enduring wonder basically. Um let's talk about some things that hold up less well, Matthew Castle.

Matthew
59:00
I know this always comes up when we've been covering these these Rockstar games, but Oh I probably winced more at some of the attitudes and humor in this than I have our other replays, just because it is reaching for something a bit more sophisticated and a bit more grounded. and it makes those slightly out of date attitudes feel out of place or unpleasant. you know, not y I I always hate being t hand wringy about these games and and particularly the humour because it's you know, it's of a certain time and I lived in that time and I remember what people were like and what you could say to get a laugh and You know, it was it was different, you probably wouldn't have blinked at half this stuff, but now it's it's like the frat boy homophobia of it. It's really tiring. Yeah. The worst thing you can be in this world is gay, and that's the punchline to about seventy percent of its jokes on the radio. And after a while you're like, I'm so glad we're kind of beyond this now. Ye And it's and it's a bummer because like I say, you've got Nico at the heart of it actually you know, occasionally they they hit on these quite surprising notes with him and his friends. Like when you socialise with people, you often s see different sides to them and they're less boisterous and aggressive than they may seem in the cutscenes, but They are still boisterous and aggressive in the cutscenes and that stuff I um I don't know. It's but it's I it feels like a blanket observation on these games at this point.

Jeremy
01:00:30
You particularly notice that with uh Florian, right? The um Right. When she meet that character who's the way that guy's animated is just like a caricature. It's like why does everyone else in this game get to be acted like a person, like they've stepped up into this HD era? And then Florian like his his limps uh sorry, his wrists are constantly in overdrive, just flopping his hands around you like this is It absurd and so homophobic but then at the same time it's like oh Nico's on this guy's side and he's saying you know he wants him to be able to to live the way he wants but it's like this like

Matthew
01:01:20
Uh you know, once you've got him through his various uh sort of turmoils and whatnot. But yeah, it's just on the radio and you're like and the mad thing is it's it's Cause like on the radio so much of it you recognize it's performed by comedians who are probably quite famous then but are really famous now. So like there's loads of SNL people And I just kept thinking, in this day and age, they would never agree to say that in a GTA game. Like Jason Sadekis would not be in a game playing a homophobic right wing right. I just shock jock. That just would not happen. Uh and yeah, I don't so it's just stuff like that just jumps out at you, I think.

Samuel
01:02:00
Yeah, I will just recap actually for the listener's benefit in case they don't play it for a long time, because I forgot this character was in the game, but Florian is one of Nico's old um s comrades back home basically who he reconnects with in Liberty City. He thinks is the one who betrayed him, but um but is not that character. Um that turns out to be someone else. And um has basically reinvented himself in Liberty City as a as a gay man having an affair with some kind of politician. Um and basically I think that's the the bummer about it is that There are some really outdated elements to the portrayal of that character, but I do think that there's some of the storytelling is sincere. I do think that the idea of moving on from the trauma rather than like hanging on to it in the way that Nico does is like one of the key sort of reflections of having that character in the game. But yeah, you're right, it's sort of like are the are the dots joined up there, you know, when that was written by Dan Hauser, um and Rupert Humphreys, like, did they want him to be animated that way or did someone you know, was that basically there's just a lack of consistency to that kind of thing. Um and some of the some of the humor holds up Okay in the sense that there's a lot of like end of the Bush era like right wing Patriot Act post-911. Yeah. Like When everyone thought um this is as bad as America will ever get, and then ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho that's that side of it holds up alright, but I do think you're right, Matthew, the attitude's.

Matthew
01:03:29
Yeah, I just so it's a bit of a buzzkill point but I think it does have to be said.

Samuel
01:03:34
Yeah that's fair enough. Um yeah Jeremy how about you? What what hold what doesn't hold up so well for you?

Jeremy
01:03:39
Uh I guess like the the checkpointing, which is something that they've, you know, kind of consistently improved through all the the remake remasters of the the PS2 was like i there's a kind of like halfway house thing here where they're like, well, you can you'll get a text which allows you to restart a mission instantly, but you're gonna do all the drives and all the segments of that back to back until you get to the bit was un which was unexpectedly fiddly and then you and you maybe get through it this time. Uh and that like those frustrations uh kind of like are can be a real damper on like otherwise well kind of paced and like thoughtfully kind of written missions.

Samuel
01:04:29
Yeah. Wha what's really confusing about this is that it's something they more or less fix in um the DLCs and I think that it's weird that some of the quality of life stuff they added to the DLCs they didn't go back and add to the GTA 4. So like the ability to replay missions, for example, or yes, like the checkpoints could sometimes be mid mission in um in the DLCs in a way they just don't in this game. And It seems really obvious to just like when you replay a mission, just take me to the mission location. Don't make me drive over there, wherever we're going.

Matthew
01:05:04
Just start me there, I already proved I could drive from one place to another while a conversation played out, so Isn't this the first time they introduced the idea that on the second replay the dialogue is sometimes different on the long drive? Yeah. As if to recognise like, we know you're having to do this a second time, so here's a bit more, you know, a few more little narrative treats we'll feed you. But you're like it would have been, you know, way more cost effective just to let me warp warp there, you know, and not have to do this again. Like that's that feels like they know that it's unbalanced enough that you'll be doing these a second time that they need that dialogue.

Samuel
01:05:39
That is true actually, yeah. It's s some of those are very different, the conversations that play out, and you're like and it y you might be your third time around that you hear. the variation of it and you're like, what that's ridiculous optional content. Like just give me like a a quick save in lieu of this and save yourself thousands of dollars, you know?

Jeremy
01:05:57
Um Yeah.

Samuel
01:05:59
Um I guess For my first holds up less well point. I I do think that despite the shooting being very good, there are times where it lacks a little bit of sheen when you're blindfiring, for example, or You just cannot hit a certain enemy from a certain angle because their animations don't pop out properly, but they'll sort of sit there in perpetuity and you might not have any grenades to flush them out. All this stuff that I think Gears of War had quite elegant solutions too. GT4 lacks that technical polish, even though I still think the shooting is good and holds up surprisingly well, like Jeremy said. But the main one I have to throw in here, like the The friends calling you stuff, like the friendships we will talk about in more detail, but something I observed was like This I feel completely differently about this now than I did then. I had the tolerance to be like, yeah, I'll go bowling with you, Roman, back then when I was playing the game. But now I've got this sort of like man in his thirties perception of like how you manage your time when you're not working where I'm like, is the entire balance of maintaining friendships and doing missions in this game Is this made by is this because this game was made by time poor blokes in their thirties, trying to balance the bits of social time they did have? Between making GTA 4. Is that why the like all of this stuff is so pervasive? Because in your head you're like, I can't, I don't have time for all this. So The way we make it realistic is Nico will experience the world in this way. That was something I felt playing the game. But

Jeremy
01:07:35
So imagine all these rockstar employees like, yeah, what's the social life like? It's people trying to ring you, you not picking up and then thinking less of you as a result. He's just so busy making the game.

Matthew
01:07:45
Well their escapism from their crunch nightmare is to imagine playing endless games of pool with Brucey.

Samuel
01:07:54
Getting a thumbs down because you didn't want to play darts with little Jacob. Um just yeah, the the thumbs down is so brutal. Um and in general I think the amount of pressure they put on you, the thing I learned this time was Um, and I pass this on to Matthew, is that you can make plans and then cancel the plans after you've made them and the thumb does not go down. There's no thumbs. Yeah, but again that's something that quality of life, surely rockstar. Why don't they just put in one tooltip that says Oh, by the way, if you've made plans and you don't fancy it anymore because you want to play the a the game, the main game bit that we made, then just cancel it here. But I never knew that and this is my th fourth time playing the game, so yeah.

Matthew
01:08:33
I think there's loads of little bits in this game which are transformative, which I could see people never discovering or forgetting about or avoiding like even the the whole kind of taxi system and the fact that you can you can basically fast travel anywhere in the city as long as there's a taxi and it's explained in those The the crappiest tutorial boxes of all time are the the Rockstar, you know, we're gonna show you this thing once in like a hundred hour game and if you don't see it there, you know, forget it. You know, you're just gonna have to sort of intuit this stuff happens. Um

Jeremy
01:09:07
Yeah, it's part of the New York fantasy as well, like that you press a button and Nico does a little whistle and then a taxi driver pulls over to the side and knocks down a lamppost and you're like, brilliant. I love this game.

Samuel
01:09:18
Birdie! And all the other parks that he does. Um Yeah, so uh that kinda kept comes to mind like it's the thing the game was to criticize the most for at the time and There are points in the game where it's not as bad as other times, but when you get to Al Gonquin, like the middle chunk of the game, the Manhattan bit of the game, it's they really turn it up at that point because you have uh a full social life, you have relationships and yeah, even though you can fast travel um using the taxis, it's like um it's still like busy work in between the missions. And I I can't say that that side of the game is entirely successful. It wasn't at the time. And it doesn't feel like it is now. Do you that's fair, Matthew?

Matthew
01:09:55
Yeah, uh I mean the fact that some of my like moral decision making and the big crossroads in this game, like my decisions were decided by or a factor in them was which which outcome of this means I have another friend I have to deal with. That's kinda dark, having you know, picking the route which means there's an one less NPC to bother me. 'Cause like I say, this time I I race through it really and you know, I remember originally I really kind of lost myself in that world and I took it really seriously 'cause I just wanted to hear all the dialogue and see all the variations and there's just so much of it and you know, I liked seeing all the the stage shows like the you know the the stand-up comedians and the magician and all that kind of stuff so I w I was really into it this time I did a Like, I I did some dating on this playthrough um and hung out a couple of times with each friend, but I didn't I don't think I maxed any of them out apart from um uh little Jacob who's like uh you know a reasonable a reasonable hang. Um yeah.

Samuel
01:11:03
That makes me think about you hanging out with j re a little Jacob in real life. I want to see that play out Matthew. You and him spending an afternoon playing pool. Yeah, so I I I suppose Jeremy I'll ask you, do you think the friendship element of this game stands up? Because I was like Matthew when this first came out. I was like, okay, well I gotta get drunk with all these characters and see what they say. when you get drunk because, you know, I've paid for uh you know, I've paid for this game, I want to see that paid for this writing. Well, it's just because I've never played a game that Ask that question of, you know, if you hand out, hang out with a virtual friend, and you get drunk with that virtual friend, what happens? And it's you know, there was a dating A rudimentary dating system in San Andreas that led to one of the darkest things I've ever done in a video game, um as we discussed on that episode. I won't go into it again now.

Jeremy
01:11:48
I remember.

Samuel
01:11:49
Yeah, I don't feel great about that, um, even now to be honest. But um This just goes so much deeper with those relationships and friendships are a key part of it. Um, I do think it does feel like busy work on a replay, but where do you fall on fall on it, Jeremy?

Jeremy
01:12:02
Yeah, it's interesting. I feel like I I really leaned into it on this playthrough. I played it over the course of like a month and so like I felt I kinda had the time to sort of deviate from the main story and I I think it works perhaps considerably better if that is what you're doing because then you're not just sort of being implicitly told off by people for not seeing them the whole time. I think a lot of the sense of this game having choices and consequences actually comes from that stuff because there aren't actually that many of those in the main story. But like the idea that you rock up to someone's house and like, oh you got a new car, oh God you got rid of those glasses, they were terrible. Like those those things kind of hit you, or those tiny little things they that make you go, oh, like I'm being watched, you know, like the the decisions I'm making are being observed, even if it's like you know, to some degree an illusion and it's based on kind of like a lot of cosmetic changes a lot of the time. And then yeah, I've I did do a lot of like this the sort of uh friendship stuff to to just hear more from certain characters. Find out more about them. Hear Nico, like, just bouncing off different characters, hearing what he tells them about himself. Like there's some kind of like shocking sort of key revelations about like Romans background and stuff like that, which you only get if you're like, I don't know, four dates deep with a particular character

Matthew
01:13:28
He drops some nightmare anecdotes on those dates which are like instant they would never see you again.

Jeremy
01:13:35
And then they're like, you're actually really nice, Nico.

Matthew
01:13:39
He tells you the most harrowing story of like a war crime he committed and then he's like, so uh how about uh I come up to your uh house? And they're like, Absolutely not. You just told me about the time you've you know, shot a peasant woman in the square or something.

Samuel
01:13:56
Yeah, and sh and she's like, It's not because you told me that story, it's because you wore the same trousers from the last date And that'll be and that'll be a a genuine thing that affects whether you whether Nico gets laid at the end of that or not.

Jeremy
01:14:08
Um I did have one really funny like maxed out character thing because there's certain characters that you get like uh like a special ability right If you sort of is there's like a sort of gamified element of that uh where you sort of we're maximum friends and so I will do something for you whenever you call me. Uh And th there's the lawyer Kiki, who's very much like a a very, very peripheral character, but if you see her enough times, and she's kind of written as like at least clearly in Dunhauser's mind as like a sort of naive like um do-gooder kind of interest in in human rights and she's You know, it gets to the point where Nico's straight up saying, I'm a you know, I'm a murderer. I think that I've kind of like my social contract with this city, I fucked it like I don't think I'm doing very well at this and she's like, no, we've we've failed you. And like if you if you've got like a star rate, a wanted level at any point in the game once you've maxed out uh your relationship with her, you can just ring her up and and Nico will literally be like, oh Kiki, I've I feel like I'm being harassed unfairly by the cops and she's like, I'll call the DA. Don't worry about it. Ten seconds later, they've dropped it.

Samuel
01:15:24
Yeah. I I love that. Like um I will say for that system that The dates I don't think they do so well, um, personally. I don't think they're I think the way that it's not dissimilar to the problem with San Andreas where It's a very reductive way. They're better done than San Andreas, but like the the gamifying of women is just a bit a bit tougher than the friendship stuff, which I think does work quite well. Like I It took me playing, not to spoil our Patreon episode next month, but it took me playing the Ballad of Gay Tony and for me to hate most of the characters in that game. To realise how much I like Patrick, little Jacob, Brucey, Roman and this and And Dwayne I think Dwayne's a tough hang, to be honest.

Jeremy
01:16:11
I I uh anytime I got a chance to save a sad sack middle-aged guy in this game, I took it and then like was just a determined to like make Dwayne a little less miserable. And the best I got was like getting drunk with him at a bar and he was like, man You know, you you have a drink, you're having a good time, and you forget that everyone hates you and that they forget you when you're on the way down or oh Dwayne, we had t we had like Five to ten minutes of you forgetting that.

Samuel
01:16:39
Sounds like one of my pizza summits with Sam. To be to be honest, I had a a time where I went to a a strip club with Dwayne. I just I just wrote in the my Google document this is up where with the worst nights out I've ever had in real life. So yeah, um Matthew is there anything else you think holds up less well about this game?

Matthew
01:17:03
This is really specific, but I think that maybe for the first half of the game, I think the city is almost too defined by its bridges. And early on and and maybe this is actually connected to your like the o your over reliance on GPS and following the magic colored line in this, but it feels like I drive maybe like 10% of the roads in this city over and over again. and unless there's a very specific mission to take me out of those roads uh you know the and but then maybe that's true of a city is also you know like that that is how these things work. They have their main arteries that take us around, but The the i particularly in the first act when you start going up to the what's the little island above the the first act? Bo Bohan. Yeah. Bohan having to go across like the toll bridge, stop for the toll every time. Like I you do that so many times and there's so many missions that send you back and forth. Almost to the point where I think did they really think this through in terms of where the destinations for these missions are? Because I am doing this bridge a lot and I f I feel like that's you know, not something they they've done in in their later games, I think they're a bit more on top of like what what is the sort of experience here and you know maybe they make a big heat map of where you're going but I think my most visited place in this amazing city full of visual wonders is that toll booth.

Jeremy
01:18:33
Um which is a true power.

Matthew
01:18:36
Yeah.

Jeremy
01:18:37
This is such an immersive some dickhead thing to do, but I turned off the GPS in this game. Oh my god. But that meant that I spent a long time initially just figuring out how the hell to get onto the bridges. And uh the thing is, th this has been the case every time GTA has done New York since the first game. You're like, oh fuck, I've I've wound up in a corner where there's no bridge. And uh now I'm stuck. Um but yeah, it's it's it's inter it to some s extent it does feel intentional. It's like you don't put toll boos in a game if you don't want some kind of interesting friction there, like Yeah. They're aiming for something. But yeah, I I it's weird that I learned all the correct slip rods in this game.

Matthew
01:19:21
How easy is it to read the city without GPS? Because it's not something I've ever done really.

Jeremy
01:19:27
Uh aside from bridges, I'd say like it's pretty it works pretty well. Like it and it and it does the thing that I never do in real life. Like I always use Google Maps of real life and then I don't know my own city. Whereas in the game I'm like, oh I actually know my way around better because I wasn't looking at the yellow line Um but yeah, and you you you sort of and I think the scale of this map works in that way. Whereas I think like GTA V is so huge that like I only know that map now because I've been playing it like 10 years on and off through GTA Online. It's it's that huge. Um whereas Liberty City feels just like it's it's sort of viable to be like, okay, I'm gonna actually get to know this place. I still know like like Albany I know considerably less well. than the first island, right? But I think feel like that's the case with every GTA game that the last areas you unlock are the ones that you know the least well.

Samuel
01:20:26
I think you've tapped into something There, Jeremy, which is how I when I came out of this game playing it again, my overall sort of thesis about it was that it is like uh the more that you sort of magnify the game parts of it And ask if it stands up to scrutiny, like the less well I think it does stand up. But I think if you If you accept that the game part is existing in the city and not doing missions necessarily and just getting out of your car sometimes and walking through, you know, like a a busy street or through um Middle Park or through Star Junction or wherever it might be and just absorbing the atmosphere. As well as like the story it's telling, like it it absolutely does hold up well. And I think that the problem with the GPS is that It boils it it it focuses so squarely on the game part of it that like Matthew says, like you get the repetition can do your head in a little bit, especially when you try to mainline it for a podcast episode like we were doing here. Um So yeah, I mean whereas you would have just called Kiki and been like, oh these toll booth guys are on my back again, T Kiki. They're doing my head and whereas I'd drive past and just like that hovering on that bridge and just waiting for the wanted rate to go and you're like, ah man, like Can something not happen? Can there not be on the they're always talking on Weasel News about terrorist attacks? Can someone not do a terrorist attack on that toll booth and be like, oh it's fine for for now you can just drive through it because some guy blew them up or whatever. They're not real employees, it's just a video game, isn't it? Um but anyway, yeah, it's sort of like I think you're you're Matthew really did dial in on something I I thought as well, which is How many times have I driven through this and yet there are like there's like a whole airport over there. I've only been in twice. But this fucking toll booth I've been in so many times. Like it's Sometimes it just the nature of a GTA game means that you can't experience the city at its best, you know?

Matthew
01:22:22
Um but I also wonder how much They were aware of what they were gonna do in the DLC and that they treat that as part of the kind of core experience even though it isn't. because, you know, they you know, not to step on the toes of our when we do the DLC in an episode, but y they you know, they they take you to you know, one starts on the third island so you spend a lot more time there and you get really familiar with it. um and it's the middle island for a lot of Gaitoni and you know it feels like they they take you to the bits of the map they haven't used and I don't know if that's like course correction after GTA 4 or part of the whole experience planned from the outset.

Samuel
01:23:05
I wonder that too, because there's definitely like stretches of Alderney that you don't really go to in there. the main game and then, yeah, lost and damned, you're like, Oh, I'm spending all my time in Aldery, at least in the first half of it. I think that's probably true, um, for sure. But um yeah, I I I think I you you two might not agree with this, but I thought that You the opening stretch of the game is too much of a tutorial. Like right up until there is like the first really dramatic sort of like basically the execution of Vlad. Early in the game sort of completes a long tutorial section. I will say that moment is very effective, but up until that point it's a very slow Drive over here, do this, or what's your first time shooting a gun? And I think that on a replay does feel very slow. Like I think it's a game that really does come to life when you get to Algonquin. But structurally it feels a lot slower than like San Andreas does, for example. Um Matthew, I don't know if you agree with that.

Matthew
01:24:00
I think that's also true of like Red Dead Redemption 2, which is like sort of tutorials the game from start to finish. Yeah, I I d I do think that. And I don't know if that's also part of its You know, the fact that you know whatever you're doing in this game can become a character moment or a character beat because whenever you're in a car with someone they're talking to you. So in their minds you know, I don't know if they see those missions as not very exciting tutorials, but more we're laying the foundation for like Nico and Roman and their relationship and then the first friends he makes and you know, the first foothold he gets in the city and so it's important to like spend the time doing that. But yeah, there's an argument to be made that you can probably get to more exciting missions, you know, a little faster or speed that up and and still hit those story beats. Um I was actually gonna say as a Uh something that doesn't hold up well. On the flip side, at the end of the game, I actually f I find the third act of the story a bit of a mess. Um because it becomes like the mafia you know, as so many of these things do, it's when all the mafia turns up and then you've got to remember like five families and all their you know, who hates who and who you're working with and I I just I just don't really under I couldn't really tell you what happens for like the last, you know, five hours of this game outside of the you know, the returning to the the setup that you know Nico is here to find this guy and you know, all that stuff I understand, but the the politics and the interfamily politics of the gangsters It you know, I remember it losing me the first time and this time I was really concentrating and it still lost me. So I don't know, maybe it's like a really strong central middle act sandwiched between less than perfect, beginning and ending.

Samuel
01:25:56
Might agree with you. What do you think of that, Jeremy? Do you think that's um that's true that in the the last act it loses something? I will say that Dimitri is a good villain in the game. But he is not the only villain in the game. And I I really thought the mafia characters in this pale quite significantly next to GTA 3's Mafia characters who while not having loads to do or say in that game, leave a really strong impression on you and were really well sort of like brought uh I mean that's like the first major arc you do in that game and in many ways brings you into 3D GTA as a thing. Um and I think these guys just aren't there's nothing that distinctive or interesting about them. So that's I think like the plotting aside, the the weaker characters in that stretch is part of why I didn't like it. But In general, uh Jeremy, I was just curious if you agree with Matthew's assessment there. Is it one strong act sandwiched by two slightly weaker acts?

Jeremy
01:26:49
Yeah, or or I'd like I'm probably hotter on the first act than maybe you two are. Like I do wonder like look thinking of the kind of the dynamic range of the whole campaign, like they have the the peak in terms of like action um and noise is lower than like you know midway through GTA five's campaign you fly a plane inside another plane. There is no way in which that fits in this this version of GTA, right? And like so I feel like maybe the curve has to be more gradual because you can't reach that kind of like that peak too early and then just plateau. And I don't mind so much that kind of more quiet, sort of like intimate version in the first act. But yeah, I completely agree about the uh the mafia, like the Pegarino family. I think they're way less interesting than Patrick and and the Irish family, y you know, because they're a real family. In the second act and they have interpersonal relationships, which are like quite gripping. Whereas yeah, like I n I know Dan Houser he talked on the the like Freedman podcast I think. He was talking about you know, he thought quite a while about, you know, how to what's different about the mafia in this this version of things. And it seems to me like what they sort of landed on was oh these guys are already like in their the crush and burn phase. You know, like the sort of like traditional Scorsese gangster story is like the newcomer joins, they see the glamour, the sort of the sense of honour and loyalty, and eventually they come to realise that's all shit, right? You know, like the guy at the top does not believe in that stuff and he will n will not honour it. Whereas once you meet the mafia in GA4, that they open with that. Like everyone's already incredibly paranoid, shifting blame onto one another, and there's just, you know, there's no honor among thieves. But um Mm. I don't know, it it's not it's not quite strong enough to be distinct. And I d like, because they make Pegorino such a pathetic character, like, you know, not to skip to the ending too early, but in my version of events uh like he's the final boss and I found myself thinking like this guy doesn't deserve this status like what has he done to earn this It was like like that yeah, there are five criminal five mafia families in Liberty City we hear and this this lot of the sixth one, they don't even count. Right. And like it makes it like from Nico's perspective he doesn't care who he's working for, he doesn't give a shit about any of of that stuff. And that's part of his charm, but it's like it's just it just does not deserve to be the the peak of the campaign, this kind He's just uh he's he's just a sad a sad old man who hasn't really achieved any of his dreams for what you know he's gonna be in the criminal underworld.

Samuel
01:29:55
Yeah, and he's just super paranoid now, says having all of his allies offed and all that stuff. Yeah, I think that it's uh the kind of like um the the highlights of the story for me are the sort of Playboy X Dwayne arc because I think Playboy X is a really like well kind of rendered character, like feels like a real person in terms of what you learn about his past and what he's like in the present. And I agree the McCreary family, like That part of it is really strong. I'm a bit more down on Manny and Elizabeth. I also wonder if maybe like too many of the Eastern European guys are interchangeable? Like is there anything that different really between Vlad and Mikhail, for example, or even Bogarin, who's more of a character in the the DLC than in this game, but like I I think there's a lot of like gloomy Russian guys who uh Nico has to do things for them or he's on the He's on like the back foot with them and so they feel a bit repetitive. So I don't think the cast is all a s uh like there's some real like highlights in the cast, but then there are some characters who just don't really register that much or like uh you don't look forward to watching a cutscene that has them in, for example. Like it's there's a there's some of that in the the game's arc too.

Jeremy
01:31:11
I think with Elizabeth you get a little of like uh hangover of older GTAs where characters just sort of drop out the story. Like in this you sort of assume like oh it seems like maybe she was arrested after the events of her missions, but we don't know and we don't see her again. Um It's cool to have Manny as a quest giver crop up and be a victim of another quest giver. Like that is that is genuinely exciting. And like there's uh One of my favourite lines in this is so bleak, but when you you take Manny's body to uh like backstreet doctor and he's like, I'm gonna sell these organs. And Nico reflects, he's like, Oh yeah, man, he always wanted to, you know, help uh help the the people on the streets of his city and now finally m he may actually do that. It's like wow That's a dark poetry.

Samuel
01:32:04
Especially 'cause every now and then you have to get out of your car and close the boots to just hide his uh hide his body. Like it's extra bleak. Um yeah, I also um I think like a another highlight I kind of throw in there is like the whole arc of working for the government and being tricked into it by uh the woman you're dating. Like that's actually a really good They haven't done anything like that in the previous TTAs and I I really like the idea you're working for someone in the government and they're gonna do you a favor eventually, but until then you're you're on the hook and it it's really good at I think just drawing attention to the the power dynamic and in the city and the feeling that Nico has always got to do. the worst thing for the worst people in order to get the one thing that he wants and yeah and so not all the characters are the strongest versus that. Okay, well I will move on to the story, but one thing I haven't asked actually, Matthew, what do you make of the the driving in this game? Like do because you didn't comment on it, I realized me and Jeremy talked about it, but I was curious, do you think this is a good driving game?

Matthew
01:33:04
I think it's got a lot of personality which I like. I mean I I uh you know, I don't have hugely deep thoughts on uh you know the driving model in terms of just not very not very good at it, but what I do know is that you sense when you're in a really capable vehicle and you sense when you're in like an absolute uh you know, pile of shit. And I I think at the end of the day that's all I really need is is a sense of like aspiration of like this thing is better than this thing. And the first time you get like a sports car in this game and you suddenly like take off and you're tearing down the streets. They just feel different going at a speed that you can't hit in another car. And every once in a while you'll find like a you know an unexpected model which suddenly has really tight handling and you're suddenly swerving in and out of the traffic and I found that that really empowering. So I I don't know if I ever like mastered it. I don't think I've ever once done a successful hand break turn in this game.

Jeremy
01:34:03
I don't really understand that mechanic.

Matthew
01:34:04
If anything, like the worst bit of San Andreas, the driving school, should come back in this because like I I would happily take a more in-depth tutorial on it. But I made it work in my own way And whatever they're doing, I think it it really works, you know, the ten percent of the time that they they give you something which is like really off the leash. I love that feeling. And if the way of enshrining that feeling is making the other cars, you know, feel a little bit stodgy by comparison, I think that's quite a good trade-off. Do you think the shooting holds up similarly, Matthew? Well, I like the feel of the guns and I like the reaction, you know, I like the actual act of shooting someone is is is good in this game. I do find it they're quite static the shootouts in this. Like I often feel like you go into a you know, you start behind a piece of cover or you find like the piece of cover that's next to you and then no one really does anything to fuss you out and uh you know, you d you pick off everyone who's in your line of sight from that piece of cover, you know, for a couple of minutes and then very safely walk to the next piece of cover. Um, maybe that is because If things do go wrong in a gunfight in this game, they can go wrong really quickly and it's really frustrating to replay a mission, so you end up playing in quite a timid way. You know, I I I think if he was a bit more powerful or had the, you know, if you pause, you recharge health for a little bit, I might feel a bit more empowered to actually be more dynamic and try more risky things. But I I don't know, every gunfight feels the same because I play it the same way. And s yeah, I don't know if that's my fault or the fault of the game.

Samuel
01:35:45
I think that's probably true. There is a sense of treating every corner like you're playing CSGO or something.

Matthew
01:35:50
Um just the fucking like someone empties an Uzi and like You lose all your bulletproof armor and like two-thirds of your health. And you're like, well, I'm just not gonna make make it through this mission anymore. It's might I may as well die. Yeah.

Samuel
01:36:04
It does also lack a bit of uh variety in the arsenal. It's a really limited arsenal and you just wish that was one way in which the game was a little less stingy. It's very much like You've got a couple of versions of shotguns and machine guns that are not vastly different from each other. But then you get to the DLCs and suddenly the toy box is cranked open and you're like, well I think that Nico Belic would really have enjoyed some pipe bombs. Do you know what I mean?

Jeremy
01:36:31
Yeah. It's it's to to the extent that like you're looking at two versions of the shotgun and you're like, which is the better one again? Like they look the same.

Matthew
01:36:38
You do it by money, don't you? You're like, Well this is more expensive, so it must be statistically better.

Jeremy
01:36:43
Yeah, yeah. On the on the driving front I've remembered like the first time Nico took Michelle out and um I hadn't mastered the corners yet. And players of this game will remember that the docks area on the first island is is really like It's a long way down. And I realised too late I was heading for a ledge. And they were just having a really chill sort of casual conversation about hobbies went over this ledge and suddenly we're in like a 60 foot fall and I I panic and like bail out and Nico starts yelling at the top of his voice as he drops. the car explodes and I'm just laugh like pissing myself at just like the juxtaposition is so insane. I just I I can't believe that this thing has happened. And then and then I'm like, okay, move on And then the kicker is like a day or two later in game, Michelle rings and she's like, Hey, I've been discharged, can you come pick me up from the hospital? The fact that the game tracked that It's like, oh man, I I sort of like written that off as a thing that couldn't possibly have happened, but actually, no, the Michelle is uh is still suffering

Matthew
01:37:55
I I had a similar thing going through the windshield when I was driving Brucey to play some pool and Yeah, I just hit something and I mean he he was just middle of a sentence, you know, whittering away about steroids or having tiny balls or whatever it is he says. And then I just like just f shot like a bullet through the windscreen, like roll along the road like thirty. 30 metres ahead and it's like, well that's over, you know, Bruce's gone home. Um when it when this game goes wrong, it just goes wrong in the best way ever.

Samuel
01:38:26
Okay, so something I wanted to talk about now is the Nico Bellick part of it and the story side of the game. So Nico's played by the actor Michael Hollick, who I believe is a a Broadway or New York Theatre mainstay. And we've obviously had a GTA since four that is less serious minded and sort of broke down the various personalities and functions of the GTA protagonists into three different characters Um so I suppose I wanted to ask if a serious-minded GTA still works when you revisit it now. So Jeremy, what do you think of that?

Jeremy
01:39:07
Yeah, I th I think like like I said it's sort of um it does alter the way it feels right to play this game, which is is kind of an odd thing. It is it is limiting in that way and like I think it it it is the thing that opens the window for Saints Row to take the territory it does, which then GTA just snatches back with GTA 5. That window closes and that series just doesn't have its space anymore. But yeah, he's he's a really compelling character. Like there's just like there are moments in this game when Nico laughs and the laugh says very specifically Of course this has gone wrong. Like it's a it's a sort of like uh an incredibly bitter uh this is what life does laugh it's like the punchline for him is of course I can't start anew and like that isn't Sometimes that's in the dialogue and sometimes it's just in the performance. And I think the actor really nails that sort of um that distance that Dan Haushauser talks about from the sort of the more uh sort kind of vapid lifestyles and approach to living um of the characters around him. Like you can feel it's really funny actually, like his relationship with Vlad, you can see how scared Vlad is just by f by the fact that this guy isn't scared of him. and doesn't seem to to place any value in climbing the hierarchy. Uh it it's it's just really you can really feel it in in the way Nico behaves, aside from what he says

Samuel
01:40:45
Matthew, I was curious what you make of the Nico Bellick of it all. I really personally feel like the character elevates the game so much. Um I think the thing ha Dan Houser says about being one step back from all of the different ridiculous characters is true. Some of the funniest stuff he says actually is in the emails he writes back to the other ridiculous characters. He can just be very cutting to the likes of Roman and Brucey. And those bits of text is are really funny. Um but in general he just I think um Even though not every cutscene evokes this, you just feel his sort of like history and the weight he's carrying around. And he just feels like a real person in the way, in a way that you know, the other characters don't. They're just so hyper-real. And so I do find him a very rich creation. And um yeah, I was curious if you think the the drama they reach for in this game, i if it still stands the test of time.

Matthew
01:41:39
Yeah, I I think it does. Uh I think he is a a well observed and a well written character and and like you say, a lot of that is in the the stuff around the edges. I think it it's still, you know, trying to be the kind of have the shape of kind of classic GTA that you know and love with all the the mad characters. I think I do think there is quite a violent drop-off in terms of uh, you know, psychological sophistication between him and everyone else spending the first act with Roman and Brucey is probably one of the more jarring stretches in terms of, you know, he's turns up full of anger and They're pretty sort of frivolous classic GTA characters. I think the thing that they're maybe wrestling with and becomes more interesting in GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2. Even maybe like Lost in the Damn, the DLC has a little bit of this, where they begin experimenting a bit more with It's not just a single character going to lots of mission givers and following a linear path through the game. Lost than a damned you're in a little motorbike gang and it almost plays like a proto version of the criminal gang that you're in Red Dead Redemption 2 and obviously GTA five has the interplay between the three characters and I'm not saying those games are more sophisticated on GTA V is is obviously very silly, but I do think playing with the the overall shape of the game maybe lets them explore some stuff in a structurally more sophisticated way. which I would have maybe have liked to have seen with this. Like it's almost like Nico's one of their most interesting characters, but is still slightly butting heads with the fact that he is a in a traditional GTA-shaped game where he goes through doing a hundred missions. I mean maybe that's tied to the fact that he's a lone wolf. Like it is hard to see the version of this where There are like other playable characters although the DLC those characters do exist in this world and you know you could almost GTA 5 this with those characters and see what happens. But um he's a not a conservative hero in quite a conter conservative shaped GTA is what I'm saying.

Samuel
01:43:49
Yeah, I think as well. I I do like it on the occasion that they bring in other characters to the to the missions. Like um you know, like a the really one of the really key moments in the game towards the end, Roman is there for that. Um there is a mission where uh you know there's I think there's maybe a couple of missions where little Jacob's roped in to to help you. um with with bits and pieces and it's nice having him there because he does offset the seriousness of Nico a little bit. Yeah.

Matthew
01:44:17
And I I think w one thing I really like outside of the character in terms of his journey through the city, while I think You know, I maybe lose the plot a bit of what's going on with all the gangsters. I think the way that he works his way up from his community into like a new set of friends and then like a more powerful set of friends and then the mafia. That's that actually does feel like quite organic and nicely done, especially if you play it in this quite compressed way that I did for this episode where I was, you know, largely going from mission to mission. It it feels quite true how he meets these people and where they fit in and the kind of stuff they're getting on, you know, the first time, you know, that's the first time that's the first time, you know, that's the first time that's the first time, the sort of small time crook stuff that he's doing in the opening act makes way for like the slightly more ambitious McCreary stuff and that gets the attention of the mafia and I thought I thought that that route through the different social groups of the city is actually like one of the the sort of stronger bits of execution.

Samuel
01:45:15
Yeah, I I agree with that actually that is nicely structured even if the mafia stuff doesn't pay off all the stuff that came before. Um Okay, so obviously in the midst of that you have these binary narrative choices in the game. Um certain characters who you can kill or spare. Some of these characters are key parts of the story. Um other uh choices, like I mentioned, Playboy X and Dwayne is a bit of a weighted choice in terms of one character's made to be more of an asshole than the other, but maybe there's a more lucrative reward if you off the sad sack who's a bad hang and um go with the uh guy who's a dickhead and who you'll never be friends with anyway because he's not part of the friendship system but we'll give you a cool apartment um as a result of it And yeah, like it's uh I don't think it's something GTA 5 does apart from its ending. I think that's right. Um, but Uh it's a key part of this and the game really telegraphs it as uh now's the time you make a big choice. And I suppose Jeremy I'll start with you. Do you think that still works as part of the story playing it now?

Jeremy
01:46:21
Yeah, I c I kind of um realize that I sort of prefer games to experiment with this stuff than not by and large. Like it's it's a b sometimes games of this area are a bit of you know, a kind of butt of the joke when it comes to like, oh, you know, Bioware did this choice and consequence stuff and then we got the kind of like the m you much less nuanced versions of that in the big kind of triple A action games of the time. Uh and they're you know, they're pretty sort of like on the nose kind of choices um in this game. But I do I do like their presence and because of the so much detailed character work in this game, they do actually tend to matter to you. I think the point where it does collapse a little bit, or at least it did in my case, was like um So Kate, right, is a crucial character in this this story. She's she's uh the sister in the McCready family, all of her brothers uh um um Irish immigrant gangsters. And th there's this very weird and quite funny sort of initial dynamic where Patrick warns you off her um before Nico is even you know he's he's like don't you go anywhere near my sister but then later he rings you and he's like oh would you take her out just as a friend And then so you're kind of thrust into this strange dynamic where you're like, we're going on dates, uh I've been explicitly told that that's that it it it is only friendship and I kind of leaned into the putonic thing. I thought it was quite Unusual and quite nice to have that like I guess like an antidote to what you were talking about Samuel and like the GTA thing of sort of gamifying relationships with women where it's like, these guys are just friends and they have plenty to chat about and it's just sort of a reprieve from all the horror that goes on around them. But then at there's a certain point in the story where it's sort of It snapped me back onto the tracks whereas like well whatever relationships Nico might have been having, you know, romantically otherwise Those aren't the real ones and because you're somewhat close with Kate, that's like what Nico considers to be his romantic future. And it's like, uh, that's not that's not exactly what's been happening through all the little choices you've made. Let me make through the social system in this game. Uh and so the like the kind of main story choices are slightly at odds with the many, many Littler ones that you can make.

Samuel
01:48:48
I agree with that. I think it's a m a big problem with the ending of this game where Not really a spoiler to say at this point, but the depending on the whether you make a deal um with uh Dimitri, um the villain of the game, or whether you're Pet Take Revenge in the former scenario Kate McCreary will be killed off and in the latter scenario Roman Belleck will be killed off. Have I got that the right way around? I think I have. Um I think that's right. P Um maybe it's the other way around. Roman dies if you make a deal. Yeah it is. Roman dies if you make a deal, Kate dies if you take revenge. But I would say that most players are I would s I would be very surprised if anyone would prefer to keep Kate alive in that scenario because, you know, you spend a lot more time with Roman and Roman is integrated in the main story. And I think what what the Kate part really needed was A sort of a s a a couple of like more scripted missions where it's like, you know, like date night a mi a mission where you go pick her up and there are like cutscenes where you see them interacting and it's Firmly she's part of the story. She's not just like, you know, in the background of the McCreary family interactions, which is largely how she's seeded in the main um the main narrative. Um because their ending is hinged a around her in some some respects. I think that's just like a a fundamental weakness of the story if you c if you um no matter what, because you want Roman to be alive, but then you don't really get if you don't have any relationship with that character, and it's quite easy not to, if you just treat her as another distraction in the game and you're just trying to get through the missions, then it it's not really a hugely significant emotional moment. Even though I do think that the game does some good things with Kate. When you're on the way to um the wedding between Mallory and Roman in this game, um there's some really great um Kate dialogue that I think um is some of the stronger writing in the game that I think makes the subtext text a little bit in terms of who Nico is, but I thought really like um struck me as good writing on this time going through it. I just thought it was a Yeah, it's a great little back and forth of like the choices that make you who you are, kind of like um kind of dialogue. So yeah, um I think that is That is true, Jeremy. Like um your v experience of with Kate may vary. Um I like the idea that you projected this platonic um version of that relationship. I kind of agree that that is a little bit in the text as well. Um Yeah. Um uh Matthew, how about you? Do you think the narrative choices work?

Matthew
01:51:09
I think I was much more excited about them when I first played the game 'cause you don't know what the consequences are gonna be, if any, and that does give them a bit of a charge and it's it's quite hard playing, you know, choice based games a second time, even all this time on, because in the back of your head, you know, you have some foreknowledge of you know, what they actually mean and I I do find it quite hard to detach from the sort of material rewards of a thing.

Samuel
01:51:39
Hmm.

Matthew
01:51:40
Of course I kill Playboy X because I want his nice apartment. Like that's all that choice is. Like do I want a nice apartment or not have a nice apartment? And likewise there are there are several missions where you can kill quite small side characters or show them mercy and a lot of those people if you show them mercy they then become the like the random stranger side missions in the game and yeah. I I would never kill them because I don't want to like shoot a piece of content in the head. Um which is you know uh super reductive, but that is that that is how I play these things. But you know, I I remember the the first time I played this, you know, way back when you know, particularly like the McCreary stuff, I think they created quite an a nice web of characters there of like who you're loyal to, you know, in the social system. who you're loyal to, you know, who makes sense to be loyal to, you know, 'cause it's basically like side with the the you know, a weaker criminal element or like the police of the city and then you've got your loyalty to Packy on the side to that and uh that I uh you know, that's quite a fun suit, but I don't think it really amounts to a huge amount in hindsight. But uh you know, I definitely um'dan dinar about it originally, which is all you can really ask for from a choice, I think, is If it makes you pause even for a second, it was probably worth doing and a a moderate success. Yeah.

Jeremy
01:53:04
Yeah. You can feel those moments where um you know, like both of those characters are sort of written out of the story because the game doesn't know which one you will have chosen. So they're like, Well we're not gonna have each of these McCreary brothers have a load of like dialogue after this point. um because one or the other of them will be dead. But even so, yeah, like I agree, in the moment, there's a there's a uh they're quite meaty decisions

Samuel
01:53:30
Yeah, where was Dwayne's invite to Roman's wedding? I will say as well, like the The choice to spare his um his ex, uh Sharice, um, does result in some of the better Duane writing because, you know, he he realizes that having his ex-girlfriend killed just because he's bitter and twisted from being in prison is like bad of him. Yes, it's a very like on the nose kind of decision to make, but It is a GTA game. You could easily just kill her and not really think about it. Um on the first time. I think what you say, Matthew, about repeat playthroughs is true. But I think Dwayne, like, realizing that wasn't good for him or her or anyone. Like it's that's still I thought was like, oh yeah, I I like seeing the writers hearing the writers flex their muscles here and bring more detail to this character. So Yeah, I think in some ways it works. I will say I think that the choice that you make when you finally um when Nico finally catches up with Darko, who is the character who has betrayed you um back in Serbia, when you finally catch up with him, you choose whether he lives or dies. I think that that is a brilliantly like staged and written and performed sequence and that still as a choice Really holds up. You could say it's pretty obvious which is the choice you're supposed to make, but not necessarily. Like Nico's killed a lot of people at this point, so what's killing one more person really in the grand scheme of things? But It's what it represents as having Roman there as his moral compass. I thought that was a really like maybe the most successful bit of GTA storytelling ever. Um you know, I think it more more effective for me than the ending, the Darko bit. So Wait, do you think it's more sophisticated than blowing up Big Smokes Crack Palace Shocking I know, but uh Yes.

Jeremy
01:55:21
Um I think um like in that moment with Dhaka like you really feel that like oh yeah there's there's just this unit of of soldiers who went through the exact same traumas. uh in Serbia and they all have each have their coping mechanisms and like it it really kind of puts into focus like you know Roman is such a like a silly car character but um As time wears on, you're a little bit more like, has he got it right actually? Like, is being a fantasist actually the best way? to deal with this because like, you know, the the way Nico is and the way Darko is, it it feels very true to to, you know, bad people people in real life are people who tend to who've their their self-worth is in the trash because they have been through things and have done things which has convinced them that they're not worth anything and probably nobody else is either Just like that nihilism comes from for all three of those characters it comes from the same events and they're all two of them have dealt with it very badly. Nico's looking at Darko and it's a sort of a mirror situation and he's like ah you know do I want to be this person uh any longer. Uh whereas Roman yeah has found a kind of fucked up clownish solution to the situation.

Samuel
01:56:43
Yeah, it's probably the biggest swing the game takes. And I think it it it does it does work. So um I'm glad it's sort of um it connected with you. I will say the one funny thing is that if you do spare Darko He turns into a regular MPC and then screams and runs off, just goes, ah and then just like runs away in quite comedic fashion, which cuts through the moment a little bit. And you're like and then you're like, uh maybe I should have killed him, you know.

Matthew
01:57:08
think what happens if I kill him now? By that that point everyone's like, well done for not killing him. But then you just run him over.

Jeremy
01:57:15
Yeah if it was Watchdog's Legion it would track it and be and it would be like Tarka was run down by an ambulance two days later.

Samuel
01:57:25
The ending we've talked about a little bit, like it it does um it it does play out differently based on uh who you yeah, which of the two routes you go down, the deal route or the revenge route. Does this work, Matthew? What do you think?

Matthew
01:57:39
It's a bit of a tough act to follow, coming after the Darko, which is really the end of Nico's journey, and then It this it no almost feels like it's like, Well yes, there are these other threads, we better tidy these up. I do like the character of um sort of Dimitri as this villain, though I think he does vanish for too long, you know, and and then just sort of turns up at the end again. It's like, remember this guy? Oh yeah, yeah. Uh you know, he occasionally phones you up through the campaign to basically say, Remember me, I'm I'm the big bad guy at the end of the game. So then when you meet him it'll it'll make sense. I think there's something a little bit try-hard depressing in the fact that it's just like two unhappy endings. That to me feels like that's how you can tell this is a g a grown up piece of storytelling. that whatever happens, it's sad. Like I don't think actually it would be diminished if he was allowed a happy ending or if one of them was sort of canon canonically a bit better for him. There's more sophistication in the letting Darko live or die than there is in in like the bigger ending of the thing. So I also just I found that last mission such a pain in the ass that it coloured the whole thing for me. It's just like I just want it over at this point. Yeah.

Samuel
01:58:50
Yeah. I guess like the key thing to say there is that if you're playing the Xbox version, I think this does apply to the PC version as well. There is like a bug where you have to climb into the helicopter after you drive a motorcycle off a ramp that is tied to the freight a higher frame rate of the game, at least on Xbox. And the only solution I could figure out that worked was running an AA battery over the A button incredibly quickly until he climbed in. Um but then I did it sort of like um without even looking at my TV and realised I'd I'd fired off a load of rockets and then had been shot down myself without me paying attention 'cause I was so determined to nail it. So yeah, I agree with you on that front. But I do think there is a I think you're you're right, Matthew. I think to not allow him any other ending is a does lack a little bit of the narrative sophistication the game otherwise reaches for. Jeremy, I don't know if you have thoughts on this.

Jeremy
01:59:38
Yeah, very similar in that I felt a little like, hasn't this guy been in purgatory long enough? Like maybe just like give him that bit of sunlight um at the end. And yeah that m that I had that technical issue on PC. And it was such a bastard. I had like I w I was playing as I often do streaming my PC to the lounge downstairs, playing it like a console. And I was looking up like how do you get around this? And I had to like pause just before the moment when you're flying on your motorbike through the air towards this helicopter. Run upstairs. Go to task manager, turn off all the CPU cores but one to sort of like manually slow down the game. Hammer on the spacebar, like just like using both hands to go like get the the necessary kind of percussive rate. Meanwhile my dogs are looking at me like Are you alright? And I'm like, not really, ladies, to be honest And then and then like running back downstairs finding that yeah I've I've I've been blown up by a rocket one second later and I have to re-engage the CPU calls and do that entire section again. Like that really put a sour taste on the ending of this game.

Samuel
02:00:53
Yeah, it's uh it's true. It's also weird to watch the game Try and reckon with the fact that something quite traumatic has happened, but then it has to be an open world game again. Let you get one phone call from Packy saying, Oh, I don't know if I can hang out for a while, man. Oh no, that was that was heavy or whatever. But then like about if you wait about two hours, you just go play pool with him and he does even mention his dead sister. Like it's it's odd. It's like that's where the it tries to be GTA again, but like it's had this story and it just as a p as a postgame it really it doesn't make any sense. And again Roman never mentions Kate being dead. But, you know, um I actually what I did this time, no because I'd never dated Kiki before. So what I decided to do was um canonically make an ending where Yes, Kate dies and the and Roman lives, but Nico does have like a bit of a a bright spot in his life because he started dating Kiki after the death of Kate. So he's like I in my head it's like I've allowed him to move on. By playing this bit of game content I've never done before, which has completely deranged um the man with too much time on his hands, nonsense.

Matthew
02:02:00
But you know The final shot of your game is just him and Kiki laughing their asses off at Ricky Gervais routine.

Samuel
02:02:08
Roll credits. I want to see the you know, twenty years hence. I bet these days Nico's on um art graders shooting people in the back as they're trying to get back into uh the lift down to Speranza.

Jeremy
02:02:18
But um every so often he's he's uh He's chatting with Kiki and he's like, Man, I could have really used your wanted level hat back when he was a criminal He doesn't he don't turn up in GTA five, does he? No, he doesn't.

Samuel
02:02:32
Um, no. There's but Brucey does and Packy does. Um Packy is like a recruitable uh heist um crew member. So Who knows, maybe he'll turn up in um GT6 as you know he's canonically still alive. I'd actually quite like that as fan service. Yeah, I think they'll do something like that, but whether they'll dare to go back to Nico or just leave him this doomed figure trapped in 2008 um with all of his sad feelings. I don't really know, but um yeah. Um okay so Uh let's talk about some of the mission highlights. Um so I think it's pretty obvious what everyone said at the time was the best mission in this game, but um I don't think it's the only good mission in the g this game. However, Matthew, I do agree with your assessment that there are a few true highlights um and that the bar is like a bit higher it's more consistent than it was in previous GTAs so What do you think are the mission highlights in this?

Matthew
02:03:26
And they're quite weird ones because I looked up a list of to see what people were generally talking about and they weren't necessarily all my favourites because a lot of them hinged on very long firefights which I found scary. I really like the one where you have to go and kill that guy in the interview and you have to buy a suit.

Samuel
02:03:43
No, that is good. That's they showed that in the um the preview that I saw. So they must have kno they must have thought this is a good mission.

Matthew
02:03:50
Yeah, it makes you think that it it's like a hitman level. It's not really, it's incredibly scripted and I don't th i it sort of hints that there's something systemic going on with clothes in this game which I don't think is entirely true. You know, it's basically you need one good suit with a tie to see certain characters and do this mission. But I I'd sort of forgotten about it I think and doing it this time, you know, I was like, oh yeah, this is kind of cool. Like y you've but you've built all these these different features in the game, like a big cosmetic system that you can go into shops and it's sort of tutorializing clothes shopping, I guess. I liked it nonetheless. I thought that was cool. In terms of a more like practical assassination level which I quite like. There's a mission called Holland Knights where you have to kill a guy. He's just in like a housing project and if you go in through the front door it's you know, three floors of of gangsters to shoot and it's it's just a big old shootout. But it's also one of the missions where it's like, you just have to kill this guy, so if you can get him another way, that's fine. and I I climbed up a massive crane and just sort of sniped him from up there and it's w one of the few times in my playthrough anyway where I felt that sort of freedom of the sandbox actually letting me kind of express myself through that and I found a way which avoided all this combat and made the mission much easier and Uh you know, I I to be honest, I think people often overstate the sort of immersive simness of the GTA sandbox. Hard agree. But I did feel it in that bit.

Samuel
02:05:23
Yeah, so you just wish there were more moments like that. Yeah. Or more ways you could solve um things in the game. Um Yeah, interesting. Uh Jeremy, what are your mission highlights?

Jeremy
02:05:33
Yeah, I I I felt similarly about like um being you know, the missions where things were a little more open in the approach they let you have. I wonder if Whenever that's happened in um in the GTA series it's almost felt like an accident. Like GTA three feels more open to that than Vice City does, simply because they had less scripting and hadn't kind of You know, the more they've kind of leaned into and mastered these highly scripted uh missions, the less room there's been to manoeuvre. And I think you maybe get a little bit more of it in GTA 4 than uh San Andreas because of that sort of like the limited nature of the the missions that a lot of them are more just like, oh, you you've got to chase down this car, you've got to kill this particular guy but yeah, it's still is still a rarity. But I w I did appreciate those moments where you're like, Oh, there are different routes into this considering the game doesn't have a stealth system, technically. It does actually have some kind of like stealthier um considerations. Whereas San Andreas ironically does have a stealth system but doesn't use it in any in any like useful sense.

Samuel
02:06:43
You go through that one recording studio, um hearing lots of weird breathing sounds. That's that happens.

Jeremy
02:06:49
Yeah, and you're like Man, this is uh this is worse manhunt, surely.

Samuel
02:06:54
Yeah. So any any like particular missions that jumped out to you, Jeremy?

Jeremy
02:06:59
Uh I mean the helicopter one with uh little Jacob that you do for the the agency. Yeah. That really stands out because you're like It's almost a kind of like um the the thrill of coming out of sensory deprivation of like being in a GTA game mode and never having seen it from the sky. And suddenly you get five minutes in the air and you're like, Holy shit This is really exciting and I'm so glad I've flown a helicopter in GTA Online so many times because I know how to do this. I don't know what it's like for like players who haven't done that and you're suddenly thrust into like Steer this helicopter around these skyscrapers and don't get it wrong. Um but yeah, I I did really enjoy that in the um in the moment. I think that has a lot to do with the fact that the game sets this kind of uh level which is below that where those things are not the norm.

Samuel
02:07:51
Yeah. Yeah that's very true. Like it's it you know it's your first time going over Star Junction in a helicopter and

Jeremy
02:07:57
Yeah.

Samuel
02:07:58
Seeing that from the sky and be like, wow, look at that is, you know, uh even though this is a uh you know, a magic trick that Vicity did uh years earlier, like it's uh This city is on obviously another level in terms of detail and it it's like a different kind of experience. So yeah, I completely agree. Um the three missions I picked out were Undertaker, which is when the McCreary funeral is basically under attack. Like I really think that feels I you know what I I kind of think that the uh the a GTA mission can be like incredibly scripted and quite rigid and as long as like the the big beats, big action beats pay off, like it that can still be a ten out of ten GTA mission. While also while also feeling that I would like GTA 6 to have a mix of those and also the kinds of missions you describe where it is a little bit more solve it yourself. There are multiple outcomes. There are cool ways in which you can sort of hack the mission. I think a great GTA game has both those things. So yeah, I I definitely feel that way. But yeah, the I think some of the scripted missions has really work well. So Um I'm a big fan as well of the mission um Deconstruction for Beginners where you take a very slow lift up and up a skyscraper. It's one of the first missions you really do in Algonquin, it's a Playboy X mission. And then you snipe all these dudes off the top of these cranes and then go down and like it's it's quite a um quite a frantic firefight, quite um It's a bit of a time limit aspect to it 'cause there's a guy who's like running away from you and it feels like one of the better sort of like set PC um sections of the game to me. Um and I but I think it's really just the the ritual of going very slowly up that lift and the game managing to reinforce that sense of scale to you and being like, you're gonna snipe that guy from so far away that If this was a PS2 GTA game, y he wouldn't even be like visible because because the pop-in is so out of control. Um and then of course uh three leaf clover, which I do think, even though it is rigidly scripted It really goes through it in terms of the the different moments that pop off. And we will talk about this mission a bit more in detail. But just has that thing where like You're firing a machine gun in the middle of this street and there's a helicopter and it it feels like Robert De Niro in downtown Los Angeles just, you know, fighting cops or whatever. Like it just really has that level of drama to it and nails it. So Yeah, um now um more importantly any missions you found a pain in the arse on this replay Matthew Castle?

Matthew
02:10:26
There's a level call uh Pegorino's Pride It's where you have to protect him with a sniper rifle and then run down and protect him from like loads of guys are swarmed in to kind of kill him at a meet. and you have to fight all those guys off and then you get in a car and you have to chase some people down and I just kept failing this e every different step of the way, I'd get a little bit further and then having to replay it and not make the same mistakes again and The the the time that broke me was chasing the car. I quite like the car chases in this game I'll say as a as a rule. Like I I think they're they're good fun. I like quite like it when they're scripted and things crash in front of you in a dramatic fashion But uh chasing this car down, I was quite good at aiming with the the sub Uzi when I'm driving. I'm c I'm I'm not bad at that in this game and I I shot the car and it exploded and it turned out to be one of the ones where you couldn't blow up the car 'cause something precious was inside the car. So you needed to stop the car and then they'd get out and then you could kill them. But uh that was just there were so many little fail states hidden along the way that I didn't think it explained properly. And that that was actually I'm 'cause I remember that mission well 'cause the first time I played the game, I got so stuck on that. I got so angry that I didn't finish GTA. uh four for like a year maybe years after that I was just like fuck that game and that was the end of it um so yeah I'm I did it better this time Uh the the other one which is a pain in the arse is a tunnel of death where you've to save the prison van. You've to you've to sort of hijack a prison van in the in the t the tunnel under the river and then you have to escape from three star police. but you've to escape from the three-star police in an incredibly slow prison van and it it really is to stand to the luck of the cop car spawns Like if they've spawned outside the tunnel, you're fucked. They're just gonna nudge you to death for the rest of the mission. And and then the and then one time they did it and they just hadn't spawned there and it I got out of the sort of police's sphere of investigation or influence or whatever. And then it was absolutely fine, but it's just laughable how much chance can fuck you on some of those missions.

Jeremy
02:12:40
Yeah. Cold Kiki, that's my recommendation.

Matthew
02:12:43
Yeah, well I hadn't met Kiki.

Samuel
02:12:46
H here's a question, Jeremy. Like does Kiki work as a is a mid mission thing? Because if you spare The um the cop McCreary, then he gives you the clear wanted level thing. I think up to three stars, but it won't work in the middle of a of a mission. Does key keys actually work mid-mission?

Jeremy
02:13:03
Yeah it does. Yeah. So it it basically I guess gives is is an incredibly powerful tool. God damn it.

Matthew
02:13:10
That was great. so many missions in this game.

Samuel
02:13:13
Yeah, damn, that's like a a genuine hack that is. Yeah, um to think I was canonically saving her for the as the final romance option in this game. What a blunder. Uh Jeremy, what about you? What are the missions that don't hold up well for you?

Jeremy
02:13:30
Uh yeah, I think you really feel that that more pronounced pain in the latter third, don't you, of like the restarts and there was one in particular with Phil who's one of the Pegarino mobsters kind of lieutenant and you're going the plan is to go and steal um a truck that one of the other mafia families is using to To pull off a deal with some Russians. Um but once you get there it immediately goes wrong and you have an incredibly tough firefight. Just you and Phil with this boathouse full of uh Russian mobsters. And like if you if you're too cautious, Phil creeps ahead too fast and he dies. If you're too forceful you go too far ahead and then you die. And every time you're like, okay, I've learned something a little more about the precise way in which I have to play this mission to get through it. And then they then you restart. and you're back at Phil's place on the next island and Phil says, let's get in this car and go and drive to the van and then we'll get in the van and then we'll go to the the boathouse. And like I I could do that route just through the roads by memory now. And I hated it.

Samuel
02:14:44
Um I I've got a few different sort of criteria for what makes a bad mission in this game. Anytime you have to tail a vehicle uh of any kind, um particularly if you're tailing a train but you're not in a train, you're in a car. Um that's ass. I hate it. Um I hate any mission that is uh that asks you to pursue a character and where you can reach that character clearly be killing them with your gun but the game has protected them to make you go through a series of traffic based set pieces where different taxis pop out of fucking nowhere because they don't want the mission to end prematurely. But like a guy's on a moped and you've hit him like eight times with an Uzi and you're like, dude, you would be dead. What is happening? The game does that at least like at least twice throughout. Um, and that is a bit annoying. Because you're a bit like, again, I've proven to you that I'm good enough at this game to catch up and kill this guy, but It's not really it kind of is against the principles of being a sandbox game, really, to deny you that um that early end to the mission. And um the other thing I was gonna mention is I any mission where you have to go into a very tight physical space um highlights the problem that Matthew raised with the combat which is it's a bit too high stakes in terms of the damage you take so A few examples of this. There's um the mission at the end if you choose to take revenge on Dimitri you go to that boat and you like could I Like there's some there's some bits in that where dudes are just popping out and it's like a you you're better off just standing back with a sniper rifle and very cautiously moving through it. Aga but again Doesn't feel like it's the spirit of the thing.

Matthew
02:16:14
When I played that it felt like Rainbow Six Vegas. I was so cautious. It took me like an hour and a half to get through that boat.

Jeremy
02:16:21
Yeah, I was thinking Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Like I was literally drawing on like hardcore early noughties, late nineties FPS experience.

Samuel
02:16:31
Yeah, it's sort of whenever you have to drop indoors and then like the your camera options are limited. Like there's a mission you have to do this for Manny, we have to climb up on a roof, drop through, and then as you land, you just like you're shot by an array of guys, then you're just like your spatial awareness is fucked. You have no idea where the fuck anything is. And then it sometimes it's just a matter of finding where the guys are. And like you have no information to find it other than when you're being shot at. And if you're not in cover, but you've never even seen the guy who's shooting at you, that can just happen a few times. So I'm a bit like You know what, Epic games were better at designing missions in this vehicle. They just they just were. Um so yeah, it's those kind of come to mind. It's uh but they're like all fairly minor complaints in general. I just I I I think I stick to what you say, Matthew, the bar was pretty um it's just a pretty consistent game, um, generally speaking, aside from the lack of checkpointing. And if it had that checkpointing M most of that wouldn't feel like friction at all, because you'd just be like, well, I'll just do it again. I'll just do it again. Okay, so as we know, three-leaf clover goes down so well. that Heist formed the basis of GTA 5. After playing these missions again, does it make sense that this is where Rockstar decides to focus its creative energy for the next game, Matthew?

Matthew
02:17:44
It is incredibly exciting. Like, I I obviously appreciate the massive leap to GTA V in terms of selling you on the fantasy of the heist, like the build-up to it in GTA V and the build-up to each of those heists and sort of casing the joint and putting together your crew is so much of what makes them work and gives the mission like a real charge. You feel super invested in them because you have planned them. But I'd say this has enough of the magic in the moment. Like there is just something very otherworldly about emerging from the bank and the street is just clear of everything but policemen. And it's probably one of the longest stretches you'll do in this game on foot. You know, unless you choose to get out of a car and go exploring. Like I drove everywhere and just being running across a road and then down the alley and through the trains. And it it also gives you, you know, it's an illusion and it's a scripted route through this mission. But it makes you think of this place as this super interconnected or if I found the right doorway and broke through it I'd end up in this bit of the map and then I can run to this place and that is quite thrilling. I like it's thrilling enough that it gets me over the stress of I don't want to die and replay this, which is constantly the back of my head in this mission. You know, so I can I can't enjoy it 100% because I'd say 30% of my brain is like don't kill m I'll be so cross if you kill me right now. It's classic trope. And there are so many variations of it and they mine them so brilliantly in five.

Samuel
02:19:15
Yeah, I I yeah, I really I really like it. It uses the open world to build a scripted level in a way that many missions don't do that. Many missions send you to a location where a mission's supposed to happen. Like like a bit like one empty building where th they filled it with dudes and you're kind of going through it. That's a bunch of missions that are like that. Or like you're going to a a sort of like a more open location where they've dotted dudes around, but In this mission, they think about things like placement of police cars to make you go down certain streets, and that sort of thing is a really good use of an open world because you can get those like highly scripted exciting moments, but you still feel like you're in Liberty City that you've not been partitioned off while a level happens. And there are many missions in GT4 that feel partitioned off. And I yeah, it's sort of and I think GT5 does this, particularly with its big downtown heist near the end of the game. that really you know, you really get the sort of like once you bust out of that um out of that vault and you've got the the loot it's like I'm in fucking downtown LA and I need to get out of here and it's sort of I and it's really exciting. It uh they find really exciting ways to funnel you through. um that city and yeah they only really dabble with it here and so I can see why I personally can see why they sort of built on that much more in the next game. But um yeah it just does many things as a stand it's just a standout mission in a bunch of different ways, not just the fact that it's the heist theming. What do you think, Jeremy? Do you think it's really obvious they hit along hit across the German of a of a g an idea here to build a game around. Do you think that's evident in the quality of three leaf clover versus other missions?

Jeremy
02:20:55
Yeah, yeah. And And they have really taken it a lot further since as well. Like by coincidence, I played Three Leaf Clover this time in the same week that I played the Pacific job in GTA Online, which I think is like the most sort of like classically structured bank heist in in that game and so I noticed like oh in three leaf clover like most of what happens in the bank is cutscene whereas by the time you get to the same kind of setup in GTIO online, they've got mechanics for like two players are like um doing crowd control and sort of aiming it you know, civilians to make sure that they don't get up and cause trouble. Somebody's like using uh explosives to melt through the doors and hacking away into the vault. And then when you get in, you're like, there's a mechanic for picking up the money as quickly as possible. They really actually expanded out everything like that you see happen in three leaf clover. It took a long time to do. Um but yeah at the same time three leaf clover is really successful in itself. Like I think the As you say, like just fighting through those alleys, running through them at that uh and and experiencing them as a shooting gallery is just not what how you experience them at any other point during the game. Uh and the writing is really strong in that mission as well, where um there's this whole like exchange between Paki and his brother during the while they're in the bank about whether the troubles are still a worthy cause to be fighting in or whether he's wasted his time. Guys, this is not the time. Uh and then there's this like surprisingly poignant thread throughout with uh Michael, who's the only character in that um in that mission who isn't one of the brothers. He's a friend of the family, he's not the family. And they just they call him St. Michael and they brutally take the piss out of him all the way along to this mission. Like the the joke is that he's inbred, so they claim. And then, spoiler, Michael gets shot during the course of the heist. And then afterwards. And this is one of those like diverging dialogues, so you don't necessarily get this one But like Packy has beaten himself up and he's gone, oh man, why couldn't I have been nice to him just once? Like and now he's gone. And his brother says to him, Paki, he thought the world of you. Like it didn't matter what you were saying. You know, he just w he just liked to hear you talk. Like, man, this is this is like uh g genuinely moving stuff happening while while a heat shootout is happening around my head.

Matthew
02:23:33
This is like hamnet with gunfights.

Jeremy
02:23:36
Yeah. So that stuff really does kind of elevate, I think that's why like it's remembered in that way.

Samuel
02:23:43
I love the dialogue of the guy who's on the ground with Luis from Ballagay Tony as well, who's like, um I'm gonna make a move and like them the it's like I don't know man, I wouldn't do anything. That's what Luis says and the guys like uh oh they said not to like make that last touchdown in uh you know the final minutes of my college football game and I broke my leg in three places but I still did it and then Uh like all of that stuff is so well written and performed. Um and then the uh brothers arguing about the fact that they are that one of them says they are brothers and that they're Irish and the the details they're giving away while they're robbing the bank, it's it's so good. Um Yeah, it's I can I can see why that happened. Um and yeah Jeremy you're right like the GTA Online those original four heists are just absolutely terrific. Um so that's something that every GTA fan should experience at some point. Okay, so I think then we're kind of nearing the end here. Um having Matthew Matthew, having just played San Andreas and this back to back, do you have a mode of GTA you prefer out of the two?

Matthew
02:24:43
I think this one is just um a much more complete experience. You know, I like the ridiculous highs of San Andreas and I like driving along long motorways listening to all the cool music on the radio stations. That stuff's great, but this one is way more like tonally coherent and I enjoy the side activities in this game. Like I enjoy the downtime. I enjoy not just going mission to mission. It just feels way more lived in. Uh everything's much more believable. I it's it's I don't know, it's just so much obviously better to me than what San Andreas does. But at the same time, I've never been someone who has put 200 hours tooling around in a GTA game. That gives you a sense of of what I like about these games.

Samuel
02:25:30
Yeah, I think um I think four easily comes out on top, even with um San Andreas having had all of the li uh quality of life improvements they've made in that definitive edition. Um I still think that original four is better personally. Um Jeremy how about you?

Jeremy
02:25:45
Yeah I agree. I played quite a lot of San Andreas recently again too and in some ways. I was always a bit of a a GTA three apologist, which is partly just down to the fact that I had a PC, my mates at school had consoles, so I didn't get Vice City as soon as they did, so like made that my personality. But like same brother. But yeah, San Andreas is so much like uh a sketch of um You know what GTA 5 is, it doesn't help San Andres that we'd have GTA 5, which is you know takes a big chunk of what that game is attempting to do and does it um in the most lavish way imaginable. Yeah, maybe if it you know in 2040 the Rockstar do Liberty City again then GTA four will end up you know, faring less well in the in our recollections but like yeah it it it feels um unique and it also feels because we know now that GTA did reclaim that absurd territory, like you know, GTA five did had have the more nuanced writing and the physics and but it yet it also reclaimed the silliness. Um it feels safe in a way to go back to GTA 4 and appreciate it for the thing it is, which is singular. And not kind of worry about, oh, is this the direction of GTA now? Do we ever get to do that again? Will I ever get a jetpack? So you know, it it it's it's one of those instances where, you know, so many sequels are iterative and it's harder to return to older sequels uh and go, oh well yes, this is a less good version of the thing I'm now playing. In this case, it's like, well they they had different aims for this game, different tonal aims, different mechanical aims, and so it like it comes off really quite strongly in that respect

Samuel
02:27:38
In a way, Sun addressed doesn't so much I completely agree. There's a in the like course of history element to to this game where even if you at the time felt a bit bummed out that it lacked some of those San Andreas features in the, you know, um two decades hence, surely you can see it as this. one-off sort of duel, um like a stepping stone on the way to what GTA V would be, as well as being so much more in its own right. Yeah, I completely agree with that. I think that's a really good point. And yeah, I think Matthew, I agree with your point about how complete it is. Like the the mini-games in it are really good. Darts is too easy. Pool's really good. The assassination missions are really fun actually. There's some of my highlights playing it again. Most of the Um the strangers that you meet, the random encounters are a bit of a bummer, but there are a couple of like slightly interesting ones when you meet the characters you spared. The serial killer guy who you meet on multiple occasions and then And then kill uh yourself. Um all of that's pretty good. I like the fact that the radio responds like really firmly to what's going on in the story. Uh I I noticed the f for the first time playing this that um they mention like an undercover anti-immigration talk task force put together at the start of the game right after you meet Michelle. And I was like, that's a good bit of like you would only know that, notice that on a on a replay, I think. But Yeah, just um details like that. It's just absolutely rammed with them. It still has the the capacity to surprise for sure. Okay, so Last thing I want to discuss was um radio stations and music. Every time we do these, Jeremy, we talk about our favorite radio stations and our favorite songs on those radio stations. So um Jeremy, what's your favorite radio station in GTA for

Jeremy
02:29:23
Uh for me it's the straight up liberty rock choice on most occasions. Iggy Iggy pop DJing. Which is quite weird now because I've heard him as an actual DJ on BBC six music. Like sitting standing there's like this is not his personality. He's doing he's very much doing like a caricature of like uh uh a kind of uh zany rock star personality but like um yeah so many good songs on there like deep purple I think it is the highway star And uh there's some Joe Strummer. I'm purely doing this based on like recognizing who I'm pretty sure the artists are. There's some Joe Strummer on there talking uh Uh what's it got? New York City? I forget. Anyway, but yeah, there's also that one with Phil Collins where he goes, ha ha huh Which is uh an excellent add to the game. It makes me think of you know when voice actors talk about doing efforts. You know, when like they'll they'll Right, you've done the dialogue for this scene. Now can we just do a little like uh some grunts kind of like You know, some oh and uh and it it really just sounds in that song like Phil Collins is like uh like trying to jump over a boulder in a video game, like those are his Athos noises

Matthew
02:30:37
So you're playing Lara Croft's mentor in this scene, Phil.

Jeremy
02:30:45
I think there's some uh some Motley crew on there as well for like a bit of Vice City throwback which is uh Which is um a good vibe. I I think I I there's there's one that's sort of a mirror park analogue on Which I predict is Samuel's favourite, but I guess we'll see.

Samuel
02:31:03
Ah, see, I do love Radio Mirror Park and GT5. However, I think Radio Broker, which is its analog, is Uh I don't think I like a single track on there, to be honest. Okay. It maybe it's just as that ear particular era, end of landfill indie sort of rock that I'm just not really into, whereas You get into a some slightly sort of dreamier stuff when you get to Radio Mirror Park five years hence, but I agree actually that Liberty Rock Radio is the strongest. But I will note that in its current form, if you don't mod it on the PC version or play the original PS3 version, which is obviously quite cursed as well. You miss out. I think it's mortally wounded Liberty Rock Radio by losing 1979 by Smashing Pumpkins, um Edge of 17 by Stevie Nicks, and Evil Woman by ELO, which are all incredible. And I associate so firmly with my first memory of playing these games. Like I never heard that Smashing Pumpkin song. I remember being in the room with um John Denton playing this and him just being like that smashing pumpkin song man, it's so good.

Matthew
02:32:05
We see uh nod along with his headphones on.

Samuel
02:32:09
He wasn't um the unk of uh music reac uh reactions back then Matthew. But yeah, so it's Liberty Rock Radio for me as well, I actually agree. Matthew, how about you?

Matthew
02:32:23
My favourite radio station is The Journey, of course. Oh yeah. Everything sounds like it would be i you could also play it in a Mass Effect disco.

Samuel
02:32:32
It'd be on the Citadel, you know?

Matthew
02:32:34
Yeah, that's the rule for the journey. It it pla it feels like Citadel FM. It's got some really cinematic tracks. Sometimes the right track hits when you're driving through like the rain and you get some like Philip Glass or something. That's that's really exciting. I quite like the jazz station. I listened to that a fair amount. Oh yeah. That's very New York there. Liberty Rock is also is really good. Even in this version, which like you say is missing some stuff, like the stuff that is there I'm I'm quite into. I mean I will say outside of that I I think I dabbled a lot more in Vice City and San Andreas than I did in here. It's not this acquired taste, but I think they're very um they're very well targeted to people who like the different respective music and uh yeah, I was less eclectic in my listening here

Samuel
02:33:21
My real answer is actually the um the version of Reddy of Lad of Ostok that's only in the Ballad of Gaitoney, but um that is not technically in the base game, so And Radio Vlad of Ostok in its original form has been completely guttered after the last few updates.

Jeremy
02:33:35
So um Well, I I will say that is that is what a mirror park hipster would say was that favourite radio shows, so it's a version of uh an Eastern European radio station you can't hear anymore. Sorry about that.

Samuel
02:33:49
No, this there's a specific reason I I won't go into that now, but um yeah it's I I actually really I I do agree with you Matthew, there is something that doesn't quite hit in the way that Vice City and San Andreas does. Like, I I find myself listening to K109 the studio more than I normally do, actually. I think that's pretty good as like a um disco sort of 70s 5 um station. That's really good actually. That's quite a consistent station. But yeah, I'm not I too just would flick over to Liberty City Hardcore and go, uh radio broker and go, uh and just keep flicking and being like, Why is so little of this? And obviously I'm not a big reggae guy, to be honest with you, probably not that surprising to the listeners of this podcast, but Alas. Um and so more granular than that, your five favourite tracks uh on GTA four. Uh Matthew, go ahead.

Matthew
02:34:36
Philip Glass, Pruitt Ego, if that's how it's pronounced. AKA theme of Nico Belek, really, isn't it? It sounds like Ven. vengeance and it sounds like you're driving into a huge skyscrapered city to do something terrible. Um like when that track hits when you're driving across like a bridge at night you're like This is just the most cinematic shit ever. I absolutely love that.

Samuel
02:34:58
Huge couple of years for that track between this and Watchmen as well, Zack Snyder, the Dr. Manhattan bit. Like it's

Matthew
02:35:09
Also in the journey there's a uh track by Ray Lynch called The O of Pleasure. Just another sort of dreamy electronic track that suit early morning drives in the city. Uh over in uh Liberty Rock Radio. The songs I like are the ones that feel a bit alien in some way or make you feel they're a bit sort of sad or they sort of run counter to the kind of energy of the city. I do like Mama by Genesis. I think the weird wailing of that really suits a long bridge drive also. Um Goodbye Horses, that f that to me just feels very like cold and urban. My final pick, which is a bit of a weird one uh for me because it doesn't reflect my music taste at all. Uh Dominion by the Sisters of Mercy. Oh, interesting. Someone has that on their Spotify rotation in the office where I work, so I hear that song a lot. And I think just hearing it over the over these last couple of years, it's just kind of like stuck in my brain somewhere. And I think it's used quite prominently at the start of the game. I think it's playing on the boat maybe It's like one of the earlier tracks you hear in the in the game somewhere in a cutscene and I was like, oh shit, it's the song from The Office that they play. I just it's got a good weird energy to it. slightly kind of unhappy vibe to it which is very Nico coded to me. Nice. Good picks Matthew. How about you Jeremy?

Jeremy
02:36:32
Yeah I I should have prepared better for specific uh name tracks but I yeah Philip Glass like Hearing that kick in is really like the dark cloud descends over the city and you could be like crappily like skirting around a corner hitting a lamp but like whatever you're doing at the moment it feels incredibly momentous and important for Nico's future direct. in life. But yeah, and then and then just like a lot of Liberty Rock stuff. The one I thought was Joe Strummer I've just looked up and it turns out to be a glamorock band called Hello, New York Groove But like I'm amazed that isn't Joe Strummer because it has like an echoing harmonica on it. I was like, I don't know anyone else who did that, but apparently they did. Um Yeah. Yeah, a bit of Elton John street kids on there. That was that's a good one. Yeah, so those are the uh I wanna be your dog as well. Like Iggy playing Iggy is great

Matthew
02:37:27
That's one of the tracks that I would change the station if it starts playing. I'm like, oh, too raucous for me.

Jeremy
02:37:33
Yeah. It's it's definitely one of the grimier New York songs. Yeah.

Samuel
02:37:38
Yeah, I've I've kept this to base game tracks only, but the um I think like the my favourite remaining track that's not Pruit Igo by Philip Glass, which I think is an unbelievably good bit of music. would be the Rod Stewart Every Picture Tells a Story. Like it's such a great I like I yeah, I think I always considered Rod Stewart quite embarrassing and he is in many ways, but like um it was hearing that made me kind of go, Oh, I can see why my parents like this guy. Yeah. Um Yeah, and I felt the same way about Evil Woman by ELO. But the yeah, of the ones that's left, it the Phillip Glass track, um Flashing Lights by Kanye West. uh very cursed individual to discuss these days, but um that graduation album was a a big deal for me in my imagined days and I think that's a like an amazing bit of music. Ye

Jeremy
02:38:25
That's maybe the perfect Star Junction song.

Samuel
02:38:27
Oh yeah, so good. Like it really It really f captures the moment, but I I don't think they could have predicted that, but it's it's an interesting track to pick, but it's like one of the most streamed on Spotify years later. And it does feel like they took a chance on a newer Kanye West track, and it just turned out to be one of the Kanye West tracks. So I really like that as an artifact in the game. Footsteps in the Dark by the Isley Brothers, which is Sampled in um It was a Good Day by Ice Cube, which is a track that appears in GTA San Andreas. And um yeah, when you hear it, just incredibly evocative. Um a track I always used to talk to s talk to Steve Burns about. Um back imagine we both obsessed with that bit of music. Hip hop by Joel Ortiz, which actually plays right after Flashing Lights um on that radio station vibe. in this game. Um and yeah, that's um that's that's my five. So uh good stuff. Um okay so yeah I will say the one thing that did jump out to me though. is that I can see why they commissioned that amazing original soundtrack for GTA 5 by Tangerine Dream among others. Like it's a oddly quiet game to revisit. Sometimes you do wish it had a bit of dramatic music. Like when you're raiding that boat at the end, you're a bit like, oh I wish this just had a little something to reflect the fact that this is my revenge mission, but You're just quietly rainbow sixing lads on this tanker and it doesn't quite feel that way. I don't know if you, Jeremy, playing a lot of GTA. You would have heard a lot of GTA five's original music playing GTA online. Did you feel that a bit replaying GTA four?

Jeremy
02:39:59
Yeah, they it's certainly in GTA Online it it lends a cer sense of purpose to some of those long drives during like high st uh set up missions where you're like, yeah, we're doing something. We're all we're all moving together and we're all fanning out and and making something happen, whereas you just be like, oh do you wanna put the radio on? and uh it doesn't quite have the same vibe. Uh yeah. I don't know, I don't like I don't mind in certain scenarios like a sort of an echoey warehouse or a the inside of a steel ship just like being left only with your sort of like uh sweaty palmed fear of and just hearing bullet cases dropping. Like that there is something to that, but yeah like Certainly that soundtrack that they they did for GTA 5 has kind of paid for itself many times over by this point.

Samuel
02:40:49
It has, yeah. And um When you're going to an empty warehouse and you just hear Nico shout, I'll fucking kill you or one of his other barks, it's a bit like um it is quite a different soundscape too, uh, to what GTA five gives you. What about you, Matthew? Do you think that game could use a bit of an original score? Does that feel like a something that's missing maybe in the like jump between PS2 and HD eras of um GTA?

Matthew
02:41:11
Yeah, I can't say I noticed it But then I haven't played GTA V for a while, so you know, the impact that it has there uh is not lost on me, but yeah, not front of mind. Um I I always wonder like would they ever give us like a music player, a portable music player in one of these games? Um and would that actually be bad? Like is that too much of a good thing, like, you know, to be able to listen to any of the music at any point even on foot I'm curious to see if they do that in GTA 6.

Samuel
02:41:44
Well I put on um 1979 and Evil Woman while I was playing it using Spotify on Xbox and it was not the same as hearing it on a radio station. Like it's there's firmly something about the ritual of getting in a car. and hearing it in the car. That I think is part of why it's why the music choices are special.

Jeremy
02:42:04
So there's also like a a diegetic sound thing in GTO four as well, where you get out of the car and you can still hear the radio a little distance from the car. Which is great. So good.

Matthew
02:42:14
I wonder if you bought four cars together and set all their radio stations to the same radio, if you then got out and parked them next to each other they'd It just sound amazing.

Samuel
02:42:24
I think it just picks one.

Jeremy
02:42:25
I think it just picks the last car you're in. Um rubbish game.

Samuel
02:42:30
Two out of ten. Okay, very last question, very quickly. Um Matthew, this is a game that lacks a definitive edition, at least right now. I don't think that'll be the case forever, personally. Um but what would you tighten up in a re-release? Checkpoints. Anything else?

Matthew
02:42:43
Checkpoints and a weapon wheel. Come on, that's all I ask.

Samuel
02:42:46
That's a those are good shouts, I think. What about you, Jeremy?

Jeremy
02:42:48
Yeah, checkpoints as well I had down and also um you notice, particularly on PC, that like It's that irony you get with certain games where it's like these this cutscenes really important to us, so we're gonna pre-render it. And then when the game gets older, it's like, oh, these bits look worse than the rest of the game because they can't be like uh tightened up in resolution and all those kind of things like uh fixed quality. So that would be nice to get then kind of uh um done over. And then just yeah, that fucking frame rate thing with the helicopter, unbelievable. But like that that is a curse that has hit like a number of games. Head like going back to the nineties. Like I remember um Full throttle has a notorious bit with like a a a fight between bikes, which like on newer systems you just you just physically couldn't do it because it was tied to frame rate. And they fixed that in the remake of that game, so yeah. It's a it's a duty to everyone to just sort that shit out, I think.

Samuel
02:43:44
Yeah, definitely. Um I think they should um patch in the extra weapons they added to the DLC back into the main game. So Nico Belek can ha can experience pipe bombs that might turn his life around having access to those. Um I think he'd fucking love the um shotgun with explosive rounds as well, the automatic shotgun. I think Nico Bellet could have a great time with that. Um yeah, I think um I don't think there's loads else I'd change. I think Checkpoints is the main one. Um otherwise I do think it holds up incredibly well. It's still a very beautiful looking game, almost two decades later. Um and I don't think I would mess with the shooting or the driving personally. Um maybe give people the option I mean, even then uh give people the option of like arcade handling if you really want it, but I kind of feel like it's part of the DNA of the game for it to be as Simulators it is it is. So um yeah, don't mess, I guess, is my advice there.

Jeremy
02:44:35
It just it just forces like um uh like a a text box when you go to change the driving model where it says you are losing the perfect metaphor for the the core theme of this game. Are you sure?

Samuel
02:44:50
Perfect. Well that is our three giant men play Grand Theft What E4 podcast. It has taken three hours. I thank both Matthew and Jeremy for playing through the entirety of GTA 4. for this episode and also hope Jeremy that you can get some more freelance out of it from various editors in the run up to GTA 6 um so it's more worth your while.

Jeremy
02:45:09
Yeah, I'm gonna write something tomorrow, don't you worry.

Samuel
02:45:12

Samuel
02:46:00
Yeah, everyone says it's a very nice non-toxic place to talk about games these days. Um I'm probably the most toxic thing about it to be honest. So uh Matthew, where can people get you on social media?

Matthew
02:46:12
Well, I'm also in that Discord, but um I am Mr Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
