Hello, this is Samuel Roberts, one of Two Giant Men, who make The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. This episode is a Patreon episode, was originally a Patreon episode, released back in January. It's Two Giant Men Play Bully Scholarship Edition.
We revisited Rockstar's open world game. It was voted for by our listeners, as you'll hear about in this opening to the episode, and determined in a poll to be more worthwhile for a Back Page pod Patreon episode than Deadly Premonition and something else that I cannot remember. It was a fun one to do.
So the one thing I will say about this actually is that I was out with Matthew the other day. We went for a cheeseburger at a place called Beefy Boys. It was actually my second visit to Beefy Boys in two days.
I also went with PC Gamer, just in case you thought I wasn't beyond parody enough, that that did happen. And we both agreed that lately these Two Giant Men play episodes are the ones other than the four-person drafts where we're like, ah, we really fucking like doing these. And if we could do these all the time, we absolutely would.
So I guess this is a little taste of that reality where, you know, once a month we make an episode just like this, a really good deep dive on one game with some humorous observations and, you know, discussing the characters and story in depth and connecting them back to our own very silly memories of, in this case, being in school. Yeah, if you like what we do here, we've done several more episodes like this on Patreon this year. So patreon.com/backpagepod, the Â£4.50 tier gets Two Giant Men play Grand Theft Auto Vice City and Two Giant Men play Metroid Prime, both great episodes.
And this month we're doing an episode all about the compilation Atari 50. That is out on the Monday after you're listening to this. But in the meantime, for our beloved free feed listeners, here's a little sample of what we make on the Patreon.
And we'll be back with our original episode next week, A Mailbag. How exciting. Catch you later.
Hello, and welcome to The Back Page XL, a Patreon-exclusive episode of The Back Page Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. Welcome to The Paywall once again, the first XL episode of the year. First up, we've got this episode about Bully, a game that was voted for as a subject to this episode by our Patreon community, beating out Deadly Premonition.
And what was the other game? What was the other game? A Hitman?
No, I don't remember what it was now. What was the other?
Chrono Trigger?
Yeah, it might have been Chrono Trigger as it was the other one.
But I tell you what, I wouldn't have wanted to kick off 2025 playing a fuckload of Deadly Premonition.
Just as well, really. It didn't work out then. They need to like dicey prospects sometimes, the polls, don't they?
Like, you know, you suggest something and then it becomes very real that you might have to play Shenmue in the space of three weeks and then it doesn't seem quite as fun as it seemed when you were doing the poll. You know what I mean?
Yes, you should only put forward stuff that you really want to do in your heart of hearts.
Indeed, Bully did win a pretty sizable majority. It was something like 40%, maybe 40% plus of the votes. So still more than half of the listeners are disappointed, but the people who did vote were obviously very enthusiastic about this game.
So 2006 PS2 game, Bully, or Canis CanaMedit, as it was known in the UK, veiled by Rockstar Vancouver, an end of the generation PS2 game, and much loved. It has quite a strong reputation for a game from this time. I think we'll get into the reasons why that is.
It's quite an unusual game in Rockstar's back catalogue, but also just in the history of open world games and the subjects of games more generally. It's an interesting one. So, a little short bit of background before we get into it, Matthew.
This was developed by Rockstar Vancouver, like I say. They were previously known as Barking Dog Studios, not the best studio name ever, I'll be honest. Assisted on RTS projects like your beloved Homeworld games, I know you love those, Matthew, before being acquired by Rockstar in 2002.
Bully apparently started life as a slightly darker game before the developers tried to merge some of the wonder of being teenagers that they remembered when they were that age into the experience. It was inspired by bottle rocket fights, running away from authority figures and doing paper rounds. According to designer Mike Scooper in a feature that Sam Horti, I think is actually a patron, sort of backer of the podcast and longtime listener, wrote for Eurogamer.
I really recommend that. I'll put that in the show notes on Patreon so people can read that if they'd like to. Some really good insights there.
A few of the core team behind Bully went on to make Sleeping Dogs, another beloved open world game that was kind of a one-off. Arguably a good candidate for one of these episodes too, Matthew. A little bit of a not forgotten gem, but just didn't quite find the audience it deserved.
Of the pre-HD age of Rockstar Games, it and the Warriors feel like a pair to me, and Rockstar Toronto did work on Bully 2. They were co-developers. So to start with, Matthew, do you think that's where it sits in the pantheon of Rockstar Games, the slightly odd but beloved tier of non-GTA PS2 stuff?
Yeah, it definitely does. With the strange caveat that of all those games in that tier, it is the one which has like the most GTA DNA in it. Bridge is something a bit more specific like The Warriors with some of the wider principles or behaviours of GTA.
I have a vague memory of this being kind of pitched as like a GTA Junior back in the day. Certainly, you know, Games Master, you know, a very clear memory of the Bully cover for Games Master because on the Meet the Team page inside, they were all dressed up in school uniforms and they were telling anecdotes about their school days and they were ribbing the art editor of Games Master because he had, I think he was the only person on Games Master who had gone to a private school. So they were all making fun of him for that and that just really, really stuck with me.
But in there as well, yeah, they were very much selling it as something that was GTA adjacent. And you can certainly see that. But yeah, I think The Warriors is the correct thing to put it in with.
Certainly in the minute to minute, it feels a bit more like The Warriors, I'd say, than a GTA in terms of its melee combat and some of the quirkier parts of its mechanics crammed in here. This is a game with lots of weird little mini games, which is slightly Warriors-esque. So I think that's well placed.
Yeah, I think the melee combat thing is the key thing. The interesting thing about Bully relative to, say, like Manhunt or The Warriors is that those are not open world games. They obviously use the same sort of engine as Rockstar's other games.
That's sort of like renderware, GTA 3 look that all those games have. But it's like a brawler, but what The Warriors, you can play in co-op and Manhunt is obviously a stealth game. So they are quite different.
They are attempts to branch out to something quite different. And yeah, like Bully is, that is as close to an actual riff on GTA, arguably as Rockstar ever really did before they became the GTA and Red Dead Studio. I don't think it was incorrect to badge it as GTA in a school, or to at least sell it that way if you're trying to get people to buy a magazine.
Yeah, I suppose, Matthew, I did want to ask what your background with Bully was. What's your history with this game?
I remember really wanting it, probably because of that issue of Games Master, and wanting to play everything Rockstar did. I definitely owned this on PS2. I was trying to work out if I had played.
So for the purposes of this episode, we've played the scholarship edition, which maybe we'll get into the specifics of that and how that differs from the original. And I didn't think I'd ever played that. I definitely remember playing the PS2 original, but I also struggled to pick out what was different in the scholarship.
Like, there were lots of things where I was like, oh yeah, this was classic PS2 Bully. And then when I looked it up online, I realised those missions were added much, much later. So my memory of this is completely fucking short, and I have no idea, like, really where the version of Bully in my head comes from.
But did you play the original or scholarship first, or what about you?
Yeah, I played the original. My memory was that the price of it dropped really quickly after Christmas 2006 when it released. So it was something like 20 quid, or maybe even cheaper than that on Amazon or something, like right after Christmas, because it was, you know, I guess like maybe it hadn't sold as well as they expected, or whatever it might be.
It was just, it just discounted. So I bought it. A friend recommended it to me, said this game is, I think his brother bought it, and he played it.
He was like, wow, yeah, this game is kind of like, I think he probably did set it as GTA in a school. But I was just really curious about it. I think, I think actually it hit me at the right age because I was 18 and sort of like just young enough.
In that in-between space where my adult life hadn't really started yet. So I was slightly nostalgic for being like 16 or 15 and just cycling around my hometown and not having to think about, shit, I have to go to uni or make money now or figure out what the fuck I'm going to do with my life or whatever. So my friend shared this.
And so we basically both bought it and played it. Because I think it does tap into that feeling of being a teenager really well, which we'll come back to more generally. And then after that, I joined Imagine.
I remember the Scholarship Edition coming along. I remember the differences quite markedly, especially the, there's some superfluous classes that Scholarship Edition ads don't really contribute much to the experience when you play them now, with the possible exception of the Geography class. Again, we'll come back to some of that stuff.
But there's a few like QTE based classes that the Scholarship Edition adds, I just don't think they need to be in the game really. It had enough content on that side of things. But I did like the Christmas specific content they added.
There's more of that. They expand the winter section of the game in Scholarship Edition. And that I very much remember as when I played the 360 version in 08.
As soon as it came out, I no doubt emailed Rockstar and said, please send me a copy of this. I played it on 360 and then I have a long relationship with this game. I think I've played it through two or three more times after that.
So four, I guess with this latest play, it's at least four times, but probably five times now that I've played through this game.
Wow. I definitely remember finishing it on PS2 because I don't know if I'd actually finished a PS2 GTA up to that point because I always got knobbled by one of their incredibly shitty difficulty spikes. And Bully has a couple of things that maybe hint at frustration, but nothing like that.
It's the GTA you can largely glide through in a pretty painless way. And so it was notable for that. There's that sense of, oh, thank Christ, I finally finished one of these fucking games.
So that was nice.
Yeah, I agree with that. That was a massive sticking point for me with those GTA games. It's like I have difficult, challenging memories of trying to finish Espresso to Go in GTA 3.
We have to destroy these nine huts in something like 10 minutes. And just how hard that was, how that took me weeks to do. And then yeah, Bully just is quite frictionless by comparison, partly because it feels like it's maybe targeted at a slightly younger audience.
Maybe kids who couldn't play GTA, weren't allowed to play GTA, but wanted something that resembled GTA. But also the fact, I think the key difficulty differentiator is that this game is more melee combat focused than it is on ranged combat. The shooting was never really good in those PS2 Rockstar games.
We can all admit that's the one weakness of those games, that they never nailed that. Hence why the Definitive Editions have, you know, like the basically modern aiming in them, because it's the only way to play it without wanting to tear your hair out in 2024. And Bully is, yeah, Bully's much, it's got a couple of things that piss you off, like you say, but generally speaking, the difficulty curve stands the test of time a lot better than the PS2 GTAs do.
It has a few mission formats that even now playing them, when they started, I got that cold spike of fear of, oh no, this is going to be some like Rockstar bullshit, anything where it's like a time limit and there are three locations in town. And you look at the map and you're like, oh, it's going to be one of these. Like, there is a set route that gets me through this just in time.
And if I don't find that route, I'm absolutely screwed. But actually, you know, you get to the third location of three and you've still got half the clock going and you know, you feel you feel quite comfortable. So I haven't gone back and massively rediscovered the GTA games.
That's a big project of the podcast this year, is that we're going to be playing them all in the build up to six. But yeah, this was almost, I almost wish we'd save this as like a midway checkpoint to like lower, you know, because I can see those games being quite stressful to revisit. And then this would just be like a nice little kind of sort of reset in the middle.
But we've done it first. But that's OK.
Honestly, the definitive edition changes. They make it such a breeze to get through the PS2 one. So you'll be right.
GTA 4 might be a little bit dicier, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Yeah.
Yeah. So a long background with this game was very fond of it. It is tied to a specific era for me, but it definitely has a place in the heart because it's a bit warmer than Rockstar games typically are.
It definitely has some of the same hard edges, so we'll get into that. But the fact that you are playing as a teenager is obviously like a very different paradigm to playing as a crime lord or whatever, even if some of the dynamics of the story are quite similar. So Matthew, as a conversation starter, I'll talk a bit about how the game is structured.
So you do go through each day, like it's a school day. You have class as you go to in the mornings and the afternoons. They start at specific times.
You have a clock in the corner that tells you what time it is at all times. They flash up on the map, but if you don't go to class, you can get done for truancy, although you never really punish that much for not going to class. It does let you go around and do as you please, really, in the classic Rockstar way.
What's really interesting is that it does the Rockstar thing of a new island is sort of added for you to explore, or they remove a kind of invisible wall so you can go and see what is going on in another part of the map. Instead of doing that, they have their own version of it, which is you start in the school and then it adds different areas. First, like quite a nice quaint seaside town area, and then some slightly gnarlier industrial areas later on.
The map gradually expands, but the scale is smaller than GTA. It's more about detail and what's there as opposed to just being this grand scale because you can only ever get across the map so quickly because you have bikes or a moped, but you never have anything faster than that. But that is kind of part of its magic too, I think.
So I was curious, Matthew, what do you make of Ballworth Town and the school as your kind of open world setting?
Yeah, I do really like the way it opens up gradually. I feel like you get given enough time to become quite intimate with each part of the map before it opens up. And your relationship with each part of the map is quite kind of organic as it would be in real life.
Like you learn certain shortcuts. You just become very familiar with how to get around it fast and make use of it. And then just when you're maybe exhausted or you feel like you've seen everything that particular area has to happen, you do get this like wow moment where the next district opens up and you get to do it all afresh.
It actually reminds me a little bit of, and it's obviously very different from this game, but in Hotel Dusk, that's a game with like very little real estate. It starves you for so long and forces you to live in a small space for so long that when it throws you any kind of bone, it feels like a huge rush. Like when you finally get to go into a new room in Hotel Dusk, you're like, oh, yes, finally, something new for me to see.
And it's just a mattress and a cupboard. But to your oxygen-starved brain, it feels incredible. Like this huge adrenaline rush.
And it's almost like an aversion of that. It's just when you're like, I can do with getting out of here. It does let you out of there.
And so things which on paper actually aren't very exciting, like here's some rich people's houses or here's one loop of street around a derelict area. You know, they seem massive compared to everything else you've just been doing. So I really like that constant kind of push and pull with the map.
I think that's really fun. So much this game is vibes and you've referenced it already, like the way it reminds you of certain things and taps into experiences. I do think like in a way that that gradual uncovering of the map does kind of mimic the sort of teenage experience of like gradual freedom and how your life just becomes bigger and bigger as you get older and feels more exciting.
You know, like your life is revolving around school and maybe you get to a certain age in secondary school and your parents are suddenly okay with you taking the bus into Winchester with your mates and then suddenly you're quite liberated. And then I guess another step beyond that, like when your friends begin to learn to drive or you begin to drive and get lifts, the world's suddenly like, oh my god, you know, now we can go to Southampton. What the fuck?
That's crazy. It has a little bit of that of like, you know, this is great. Like I'm completely off the chain here.
I don't think there's anything in Bully which is as exciting as going to Southampton by yourself. And like, you know, spending all your pocket money on Cinnabon, because there isn't a Cinnabon in Winchester and having to fib about it when you get home, you've just ate four Cinnabons.
There's no New Quay shopping centre in Bully.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, yeah.
But it kind of has a bit of that, and it is quite liberating. These moments come, and you lose that thrill as you get older, because when you're an adult, you can fucking go anywhere. If you've got the money, you can just fly halfway around the world.
A bit of that thrill is lost, but I definitely remember those gated moments of your life kind of opening up. It can't help but kind of bring you back to that a little bit.
Yeah, I agree. That did trigger a few memories along those lines for me playing it again. I remembered how when I was in year seven and I went cycling around, I went to the other end of Stokes Bay in Gosport where I grew up, like along the coast and into this big estate called Gomer Estate, which I didn't know much about, but there's a school across town where all these other kids went, and it was sort of like their stomping ground.
They had a newsagent there that sold slightly more Nintendo magazines than my newsagents did. All these thrilling discoveries. But again, like you say, it's like the, oh, I'm on a bike and I can go wherever I want, and I remember going downtown by myself with my little girlfriend in year six or whatever and just been wandering around.
I was like 11. That seems actually quite young to be doing that, now that I think about it. But it's very true, the gradual peeling back.
How thrilling it seemed when we were allowed to go to Portsmouth Games Workshop. As long as I went with three or four other mates when I was 13, my mom didn't mind me doing it. But going to the game station there and stuff like that.
Yeah, it does mimic that quite well. I will say the one thing that I will say about the open world is that, there are parts of it I like when it peels back. I think the Bullworth Town area, Bullworth Vale area is really good.
You get like a fun fair along the map and the whole body of water to swim in. You get this little lighthouse space at a certain point to sleep in, and there's a lot of character there. The later industrial areas where the greasers live and where the townies live are not as interesting.
There's a mental asylum with, for want of a better word, that they add to the map. I think it's quite a cool addition. And like an observatory behind the school as well, that's a cool thing that they expand the map with.
And the thing that does always remain is that there are some really interesting little paths you can cycle through between the different areas of the map, and a lot of it becomes about remembering what the shortcuts are to get to the places you want to go. That I really, really like. And the vibe of it's never lost, but I think the opening school and town areas are so good, that those later areas don't quite compare.
I don't know if you think that's fair.
Yeah, I will add a bit more that we can maybe talk about that in what hasn't aged as well. About maybe like the later stretch of the game. And I think it is tied to definitely like the area.
When you've just had like beautiful suburbs and an amazing like Beach Cove town to suddenly be in like generic factory district. It's not quite like the amazing cell I think it is.
No, that's where it becomes the Gothsport Hampshire open world. Where it's like, oh, you know that area that used to be around Asda with the big like power plug thing. That's in this game.
And you're like, yeah, didn't really want to explore that again.
I mean, that is also true to life though in that. When you have a little bit of freedom, you go to all the exciting places you've wanted to go. But then there does come the time.
Maybe you get a job, you know, at a supermarket, whatever, where you probably are then going to be pushed to spend a lot more time in an industrial estate than you ever thought you were going to. Like the bit of Winchester with the home base and the Tesco and the outskirts of town, you know, it's not a very picturesque bit of Winchester. And I spent way more time there.
I guess maybe they're just tapping into like, this is where we all end up. We all end up in the factory district one way or another.
Yeah, yeah.
That's life.
A very enlightening thought and not at all depressing observation about young life. No, I think that is true, but in an open world game, it does make it a little bit less exciting. I think it makes sense for Matthew to get a little bit more granular.
So I'll tie these things together. So I feel like a lot of the game's character and its winning qualities when you play it now are actually outside of the story, which I do quite like. And more in the moment to moment gameplay, riding a bike through the school grounds and doing drive-by punches on people.
You can like punch left or right when you're on a BMX or any bike, and then just cycle off from the consequences. That never stops being fun. Doing wheelies, hopping around on bikes, being chased by a dog while you're doing a paper round, listening to incidental kid dialogue, seeing the kids in this game interact like one just knock another one over, then run off and then get caught by a prefect.
I guess like that's a bit more of a vibe thing. But I think that in some ways, I think like the game itself is slightly softer than the story suggests it is. Like in the story, Jimmy is quite a hard edged character.
He's a little bit Tommy Vercetti-esque. Or like Michael in GTA V, a player trying to get his way to the top. But I think in the moment to moment gameplay is where you see the real character of this game.
And I just think it's like, and I always cite this as the ultimate example of this, but the fact that you have to be in bed by a certain time because Jimmy will fall asleep. Like that to me is like the real, that or finding like the pirate kid in the boat in the bay as like an Easter egg. I like the, that's where I think I see like the softer non-GTA edges of this game coming out.
And that I think is what I love the most about the game. But I wanted to use that as a kickoff point to talk about what you think this game does well and what's aged well about it.
I think what it reminds me of, strangely, is actually Fable, which I think it shares a lot of DNA with, in that it's about the pleasure of being in a slightly comic ecosystem, and just seeing the weird interactions. There's always a bully doing some horrible Chinese burn or something on some kid in the school ground. The lines of dialogue, there are so many NPCs, and they're all yelling at you as you run past them.
So it's just this cacophony of random comic soundbites, which is just like being in a town centre in Fable. Especially when you get into the realms of cosmetics in this game, and the very light role-playing of being able to save up money, and buy costumes, and buy better uniforms, or things that express some character. And then seeing characters react to those, you know, like, there's a bit where you get given, like, a terrible Christmas jumper with, like, a reindeer on it.
And as you walk past, everyone's like, ha ha, like, what a terrible jumper. They're all kind of pointing at you and saying stuff. And it never struck me before, but that is just, that's like Fable through and through.
Like, the pleasure of that game is just, like, being in a character-rich environment, and just absorbing it all and letting it wash over you. So that element, I thought, was kind of quite interesting. And it's there, like, wherever you go.
It's the constant background noise of this game is just very sort of pleasant to dip yourself into. But I really like the role that, like, time and the school day plays in this. I like that it's almost a GTA campaign in terms of how it's structured, going, meeting people, getting given missions, going and doing them.
But then over the top of that is this constant sort of like meta layer of you are at school and in theory it will kind of make certain tasks harder at certain times of day, you know, like, there's a good time after school where there's no lessons, where you can probably go and do a couple of missions. But if you're impatient you can bunk off class and go and do those. The only risk then is that you are, you know, you're plain truant and if any authority figure sees you, they will try and catch you.
They're not very efficient, so it's not actually a huge risk. But I like the idea that you can progress the story and chase the story on your own schedule, or you can kind of play it, you know, very straight and do the school day as you're meant to, and do the missions in the time that you're allowed to. And I think the way it kind of shifts all the mechanics and finds ways of doing, like, the rules that would impact a child as opposed to a criminal, you know, like GTA is like that in that you're doing these missions, and if you ever do anything naughty, the police might get you, and it has that almost like systemic layer above it.
But here I think it's even more elegant than that, because there's this whole, like you say, school day that you're meant to be doing, and you can and can't, you know, if you want to engage with it you can, and if you do there are benefits, you get special abilities and new items for doing certain lessons or whatever. That's like formally, it's way more experimental than like most GTA games. That sense of like there's two games happening side by side, and one is the naughty thing you're not meant to be doing, you know, and one's the right thing, and that kind of deciding what you're going to do.
I mean, for this particular playthrough, just because I was trying to get through it, you can ignore a lot of the school day, and I was curious like how you actually played it, like yourself, like whether, you know, are you a good little boy doing two lessons a day, or did you get to the end of the game and you've like barely done one of each lesson, which is almost what it was like for me.
No, I did a lot of the lessons because I remember that some of them give you tangible in-game benefits, particularly chemistry, which gives you increasing numbers of items, weapons to use against people, like firecrackers and stuff, and then increases your inventory of each one. Or like doing gym, which gives you new fighting moves, for example. Like those, I like, and also I think they do add to the character of the game in some ways, because the teachers in them, not all of them have loads of screen time in terms of cutscenes, but they're quite well thought out, the character designs and how they sound and how they speak to Jimmy.
They too, I think adds to the texture of Ballworth as a school. And so that's why I like dipping in to those even if I'm not... That was one of the things I was more mixed on playing it again, was that some of those classes are quite onerous, but I was a good little boy in some ways.
I got to like three or four in most classes.
Oh wow.
Yeah, yeah.
That's interesting. Yeah, I did... I was trying to act like the hard man.
I did a couple of classes of most things, but I definitely had like days where I... If I had a mission, I'd basically go and do it, because I felt confident that the prefects weren't going to get me. I'm more stressed about doing missions late at night and potentially running out of time and falling, because if you hit a certain time, you're not back in bed.
You just sort of collapse from exhaustion. And in my head, I had that that was more of a threat than getting caught. So, yeah, I was kind of rinsing stuff in the day.
But that structure is interesting. Like, I can't think of another Rockstar game that kind of has that meta layer, maybe like the drug ecosystem in Chinatown Wars, where there's like something bigger going on, which you can almost play as its own game alongside the mission by mission stuff. It's almost a sort of shame.
But then maybe that you can only do that in this particular location or on this particular scale.
There's the gang war stuff in San Andreas, but it's very, it's very slight by comparison, I think. It's I mean, obviously, they had to think about what the mini games would be for all of these different classes. So that alone sort of sets it apart.
But yeah, I can't really think of something else quite like this in other games. It is definitely part of the magic of it, for sure. I really like your comparison to Fable, actually.
That's a really good shout. The NPC interactions and stuff like that, and the sort of overall character of it and the soundscape. That's a really good observation.
I like that.
Yeah, because it's about reputa- you know, a lot of the game is about reputation and that's like Fable's whole thing. And the only way you can really depict that is how people react to you, I guess.
Other stuff I want to say aged well. I think the choice of melee combat in this has aged well because it would be much worse if you had to wrestle with the ranged controls more frequently. Using a slingshot in this is still better than trying to headshot someone with a machine gun in GTA for sure, but it's still not the best mode of it.
I think this melee combat has actually aged quite well because it's just sort of like, it's quite broad, you know? It's sort of like, you grab enemies, you punch them, you knock them down, when they're down, you can do various moves to sort of like, you know, sort of like climb on top of them and just punch them or knee them. And like, I think it's got a fair amount of variety in it once you level up.
And there's like a homeless guy who lives on the school grounds, so if you give him like a radio transistor, it will teach you new moves. And like I say, in gym, you learn new moves. And that choice feels really good because it just means that you never really go into a fight with this feeling of dread, because you're going to get shot in like two seconds, which would happen in so many GTA missions.
You stood in the wrong place and just got gunned down. The fact that it's melee combat, and that that melee combat has aged well, that it still feels good, it still feels chunky. The sound effects are really kind of like, you really hear the smacks or whatever.
That's really fun, Matthew. Is there anything else you wanted to chuck in as things have aged well?
The fact that it takes place over a year and the fact that it has a small map means the map does go through seasons. And I think some of the seasons are more successful than others. Like the first season, you know, autumn has this big Halloween set piece, which I really like.
And I think we'll get to some of our favourite individual missions in a bit. The Christmas season is like the standout because it's just so packed full of Christmasy missions, which, like you said, had been sort of added for the scholarship edition. And like the snow on the map is a lot more obvious.
I think the spring and summer are slightly harder to appreciate. You know, I'm not sure they quite nail what defines those seasons for a teenager, other than it's a bit brighter. Which is interesting because you can imagine a version of this where, you know, for a young person, the whole point of the summer is it's a longer day.
You know, it's that's exciting. You know, the night goes on forever and you can just be out longer. And you could see a version where they could do something more with that.
They don't. I mean, time is time in this game and it behaves, it behaves the same throughout the whole game. But definitely like it opens strong.
Autumn and winter are like very clearly done. And, you know, that's just another way of almost recycling the limited real estate they've got because it just looks so visually different. And there are, you know, decorations and whatever.
Yeah, yeah, I really, I really love that side of it, too. The seasons of just like are just so, so cool. And the yeah, the closest GTA gets to it is GTA Online Snow Stuff at Christmas.
And right, it is really nicely done. It's a bit of a shame you can only do it in GTA Online because that will put a lot of people off ever seeing it. But, you know, it's arguably a much bigger job to do that to a HD Rockstar map than it is to a PS2 era one.
But yeah, I love that character about the games, too. I agree that some seasons are more successful than others. But I do also like the idea that the very end of the game is Endless Summer, which again, feels like a very kid kind of concept, you know?
Just the feeling of time stretching out and then you've just got nothing but time on your hands to do stuff. Yeah, I really like that about it. I think another thing that's aged well about it, and I think we'll talk a bit more about the story, but you play this kid, Jimmy Hopkins.
You are sort of at the bottom of the food chain when you come to this school. Your mum has remarried several times and you're basically being chucked into school while she's going on her umpteenth honeymoon and the teacher's aware of you because you've been expelled from previous schools and you are not well liked by any of the different factions in the school. I think that that underdog story, and it has a little bit of a kind of class elements to it, which I quite like.
It's a little bit different to Rockstar Games and other Rockstar Games in that respect, which are a bit more about you overcome a criminal faction and you show the mob how useful you are or whatever. In this is a little bit more directly like a lot of the factions feel pampered and privileged. It feels like a private school where you are an interloper.
And I think that has aged quite well as a concept. So I like that about it, Matthew. Let's get into some stuff that has aged worse, because we have other areas to talk about some of the good stuff about this game.
Yeah. I think there's some stuff that has not aged well at all about it. But I was more curious to hear your take, because I have a layer of affection for this.
But I would rather have a bit more of your cold objectivity about what has dated about this game.
In a game which is about the dog eat dog world of school, so I get it that it's got to be quite not raw, but rough around the edges. It is quite unkind and sneering in a way that I have less appetite for now. Everyone in it is like a relentless shit, and you are like king of the shit.
Your aim is basically to become king of the shit by being the biggest shit of all. But that is kind of Rockstar satire. It is a little bit like a shotgun blast.
It takes out everyone all at once. But it's quite a cynical world where no one is good. Probably the only good, truly good quote unquote character is just this huge fucking wimp.
Like this sort of nobody kid who hangs around with you. I can't remember his name.
Pete Kowalski?
Yeah.
My guy.
Yeah, there's that. But I am interested this year in revisiting the GTA games. I fear that is going to be the biggest sticking point with a lot of these things.
It's just like the tone of them. That once seemed edgy and fun, now seems maybe a little less palatable. I wouldn't say there's anything too like outrageously horrible in here.
There was nothing where I was like, you know, we should be cancelling Bully, but it's pretty mean-spirited.
It is. That's actually one of the really interesting things that I feel plague it now, is it has reframed slightly as a piece of media because now it is a time capsule of mid-naughties schools and the dynamics there. Like there was a bit where, and I'm purely quoting the character here, where a kid just yells, TARD, and walks off.
Obviously now, you just cannot say that, you cannot have that. But that is absolutely something that someone would yell at another kid in the mid-naughties. So that was hugely a part of it.
I think the slight mean-spiritedness of it, and that does extend to how different characters are portrayed or whatever. I think that that and some of the ways in which it treats female characters are probably the most egregious things about it. They are like things to be won, basically, the women in this game.
Yeah.
I'm sort of like, yeah, they're very sort of like, you can argue that all characters are one-dimensional in the story of this game, and maybe in some of Rockstar's games generally. But the women in particular are cheating, or they're just sort of like objects, and you just give them stuff and they kind of kiss you. And I think they are trying to sort of like boil down things to teenage romance dynamics in some ways and have them be sweet rather than sinister.
But some of that stuff is inevitably just going to date a little bit. I don't know if you have thoughts on that.
I'd agree with that. Or they're like punch lines in jokes for like pervert characters. And even though you look down on like the perverted gym teacher who wants photos of the girls in their dorm, or like the nerd who wants, I think, more photos of them in their dorm, like there's a, I feel like I snuck into that dorm a couple of times to take pictures of girls and like steal their underwear and stuff.
Stealing underwear for the teacher. No way that goes in a game in 2025.
Yeah, I mean, there's like, that sort of stuff is, it's quite like Animal House, you know, it's quite like 80s. And you could probably get away with it as a, oh, well, like this is an observation on that era. But it's presented here, like, pretty without question, which is maybe why it seems a bit more egregious.
Well, that's worth noting, I think, as an influence on this game. 80s comedy movies are bound to be in the headspace of the developers who made this, bound to be an influence on them. And that is probably the most obviously depicted in the faction dynamics, right?
Because they weren't really like, certainly in my school, not really, they were definitely nerdy kids, but they were like, the specific nerd, greaser, preppy factions feel very, I mean, obviously they're very American, but in some ways they feel very 80s or 70s as well, you know?
I struggle to place this game time-wise, because greasers feel, that feels like fucking happy days, you know?
Yeah.
That's like 50s.
But they have, they have video game arcade cabinets that are fairly elaborate, they have 3D, they've got wipeout-esque 3D games, so it must be in at least the late 90s, you know? Yeah.
But the town and the music is very 70s-ish, like the fashion is very 70s-ish. Maybe that's still elaborate. I also was wondering, this isn't like a strength or weakness, I was puzzled over which country's schools it was based on, because in my head, even though it's set in America, it feels quite British, that playground, and the vibe of it, and I don't know, just with Rockstar having, you know, Brits heading up the whole thing, if they're an influence on it, or maybe just these school experiences are quite universal, but the school looks very British to me, rather than like, you know, what I have in my head of an American high school.
Yeah, I agree with that, there is a slightly British edge to it, which feels like it's probably tied to the, you know, the origins of Rockstar, right? And the fact that GTA comes from the UK, and the houses obviously, I think the houses grew up in the UK, or certainly have like strong ties here. So, yeah, I agree.
It's funny because I did research, some research on the locations, and there are definitely towns that look a lot like Ball with Veil, like that sort of like beach town, pretty picturesque vibe, that's very real. But people online couldn't seem to agree on exactly what the school influence was. There's definitely, there's like a Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire that looks very similar in terms of like some of the building architecture, particularly the classes, but people reckon there's a Scottish school called FETS or FETI's.
I have no fucking idea what that's called, probably not FETI's to be honest, probably FETS. And like that, that too is apparently cited as an influence. But I agree that I actually think that gives it a slight universality, though, that really adds to it.
I feel like I'm weirdly in this British-American mix that I haven't found anywhere else in games or indeed pop culture, you know?
Yeah, because particularly the nerd faction with their little green jumpers and grey shorts, that's like pure Grange Hill to me. But then like preppies, I'm like, well, that's very American, that's not a British thing at all. But yeah, it's not a criticism.
It's more of I was curious where what you thought it was. I guess it's a bit of like wherever it is, the Holdovers is set. It is almost like a kind of classier version of this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
There's a version of this now where Paul Giamatti in the Holdovers is a teacher in Bully, like he's DLC.
Yeah. He says, Jimmy, I need you to go out and get me some deodorant for my date tonight.
My weird fish body condition.
Yeah, I like that theory.
Yeah, I would be up for that. Some other things that have aged less well. I think a lot of the missions are super thin in that you often spend more time getting to the locations than what the actual task is when you get there.
And that isn't how I remember this at all. Again, I am expecting this to be quite true of some of the other older GTAs when we get to them. But there's a lot of cycle across town, throw three eggs at a house and then leave.
There's very little separating that from some of the mini games you do in this. It definitely does step it up at times. The key story moments have missions with multi-steps to them, or interesting, bespoke locations.
But it's not like it gets repetitive. It just feels like a little thin in places, or like maybe reveals that they don't have a huge amount of things to play with to actually build these missions out.
Yeah, I think that the really interesting thing about playing this is that it underlines the extent to which GTA IV was this generational leap. Because the missions become so much more elaborate, more scripted, more narrative elements. And this is sort of like the last hurrah for the old GTA PS2, go here, do this thing, the mission's done kind of structure, which is what all of these games were.
And every now and then, I think it gestures towards that slightly more elaborate GTA IV, GTA V, Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2 mission structure of having the kind of narrative element, as well as like a few scripted little bits. Like raiding the observatory, for example, come back to some of the missions. But like multi-part missions where there's more going on.
But I agree that a lot of it feels like busy work, and so has dated. That's a definitely fair criticism, Matthew.
This isn't like a huge negative point against it, but something that puzzled me is the respect system is like a whole lot of nothing in this game.
Yeah.
Like it's not actually a systemic respect system or faction system. It's like baked into the story where, you know, which missions do or don't give you respect with different factions. And in the final stretch, when like everyone's meant to turn against you, they suddenly drop like 50 respect points for every faction.
And I just I never really engaged with it. I never gave it a second thought. Like it didn't impact the game at all.
I never felt its influence bubbling up and affecting how NPCs were treating me. Like nothing came of it. I was trying to think back to other games from this time.
Like you know, was there just like a factions thing going on? Was everyone playing with this idea? Like were other games doing it?
And I don't like, I couldn't think of many that were. So I don't really know why it's in there other than like sprinkling some icing on some story beats. It's like you get to the end of the mission and you know, you've just done something nice for the preppies and it goes plus 25 for the preppies just to underline the fact that they like you now.
But them liking you or not has really like no influence on what happens. So that's a little strange. It doesn't make it bad.
It's just like pointless.
I think the problem is that labeling it as a system makes it seem more important than it actually is. Right.
Yeah.
What it really is, is a tool of the story to give you an idea of where you are in this sort of strata of these school's factions. But it makes it seem like a measurable system you can somehow affect the outcome of. And obviously you can't.
But I think it... I noticed that having played the game enough times to see the granular thing of like, some factions will start to fight with you automatically if you're super, super low.
Right.
And then some of them will be like, hey, I'd be quite friendly to you if it's quite high. And that really is about as rich as it gets. It's never really that impactful, I agree.
I think maybe just because I've been playing a lot of Star Wars Outlaws where the faction system is like, it's probably like, the most interesting thing it does. It was at the forefront of my mind. It's maybe why it stood out a little bit.
It's just a missed opportunity though, because actually factions translates and maps on to school playgrounds so well. Like, it's more believable there than it is in a city to me. You know, like the idea that a gang owns this neighborhood or that neighborhood.
I know that actually happens. But like the idea that this part of the school becomes quite dangerous now because you're upset that the people who kind of call it home. And it's the kind of thing where I think if you were to make a sequel to this game or do it again, that is something where you'd like, well, I would hope they'd really like blow that out or make that into something.
Like the idea that, you know, you have some choice over who you ally with. Because actually in this game, you're constantly befriending and then upsetting people and you have no say over it. You know, like I didn't I didn't particularly want to rag on the nerds, but it chose, oh, well, this mission, that's going to happen.
That felt a little unsatisfying. Like when I just won them over and then two missions later, I'm working for another faction to upset them. I just thought, well, would I actually do this?
Probably not. But like you say, it's framing. It's not like the game.
I've got another age poorly for you.
Oh, yeah.
You can touch girls on the ass. That's not ideal.
Can you?
Yeah. If they're like turned around, you can press the B button and touch them on the ass, including like the really young girls. You'll get punished for it, but it's in the game.
So that's definitely something you just would not have in a game.
I didn't even try that, Sam. I didn't know you could do that.
I was trying to be comprehensive, Matthew.
See, I was trying to roleplay as myself. I'm a good guy. Everyone knows I'm a good guy.
The most egregious thing about that is that on the little controller prompts in the bottom left-hand corner, it's actually like a panty, little cartoon sort of like panty comes up. You just definitely couldn't do that now, obviously.
One tiny specific thing. There's a video game you have to play to win over the nerds. It fucking sucks.
It sucks so bad. Consumo, I think it is.
Consumo, it goes on for ages.
It's so long. When I was playing that, I thought from now on, only people who worked on UFO 50 should be allowed to make fake retro games for other games. They should just hire out their services and go, we'll come in and make you an actually good game, rather than a thing which takes like 15 minutes, where you're dodging out of date noodles as a sumo wrestler.
That fucking sucks. I was like, you know what? I don't even want that save point.
That nerd challenge, I just ignored it. I couldn't do it.
Good music though, Consumo, I've got to say. It did stick in my brain afterwards. I was like, but I agree, it does your head in.
Some of the barks from the nerds really do your head in as well.
It's so long. It's like 10 minutes long if you want to beat it.
It's about three times longer than any sensible person would make it. It just goes on and on and on and on.
I was like, am I playing it wrong that it's lasting this long?
No, you're doing it right. It's just for some reason. I remember that being a sticking point when I played the PS2 original.
That was even something I didn't like in 2006. I think they just think you'll be wowed by the novelty of a game within a game, and it's not the one.
It absolutely sucks.
I don't love the games within a game in this. The Wipeout one is slightly better, but they're not really the game's strong suit.
My bigger thing is, I'm really not into the last chapter of this game. I think the area that opens up, the industrial area, we mentioned it earlier, I just don't think it has, it feels so different. It just feels like a bit of GTA, like it doesn't fit in that town at all.
I found the townies quite a confusing faction for that chapter to be about, like the idea of a town. I don't know if I'm just not that familiar with them, but after all this school hierarchy, there's suddenly other people you've never seen the whole game that you have to deal with. There's this rubbish bit where you have to go into a factory and fight in a chemical plant, and it looks like a bit from Metal Gear Solid or something.
I'm like, why are we here? This is so weird.
It actually reminded me of Beyond Good and Evil that bit. It's just like I'm in some shitey green location and it goes on for ages.
That very end bit, the end fight with Gary, is cool. I like that. But I think that last chapter is just a bit of a duffer.
And the big dramatic moment of the story, again, we just have to go weapons-free with spoilers here. The whole game has been about you've built up all these factions by being the best bully at school. And all throughout this, your little mates, like you've got to watch out, like you're going to get screwed.
You know, you're going to make all the mistakes that Gary made before you. And, you know, you're going to become the baddie, basically. And that sort of happens, but it kind of happens in a cutscene.
And it's quite you're just sort of told everyone hates you. You come back and they're like, oh, everyone hates you now. And you're like, oh, OK.
And that puts you on the path of the final stretch of the game, we have to sort of like reunite everyone to bring down the big baddie. But I thought it was really like sloppily done that last act after quite a nice slow build. It suddenly just goes, oh, yeah, you're back to square one.
And then half an hour later, the game's finished. You're like, really? It seems very rushed, that ending.
I agree. I think it does do what I think is a classic Rockstar PS2 era trick of all the NPCs start fighting each other. I like that.
Yes.
When in the school, this is everyone's. It's pandemonium. Everyone's fighting each other.
That's fun.
That is good. The last mission itself is good.
Yeah. But I agree. It's a bit arbitrary how they come undone.
I do like the idea at least of the rise and then the fall, and then the re-rise. Like you say, the last mission is good and pays off so well. I think it leaves you with a bit of goodwill.
But yeah, I don't think that's necessarily unfair. I actually do think in general, playing this again, I felt the first half of the game was a bit stronger than the second. The second, it definitely has its moments, but I think I prefer the early unravelling of the game.
And we'll talk about some of our favorite moments in a minute, but going to the fun fair and that sort of thing. Some of the earlier faction bits. I wasn't really as bothered about the mentally ill Greaser guy whose girlfriend he's got a weird thing about.
And like you say, the townies are a bit of a non-starter of a bunch of kids, really. They're not really anything, even if they remind me of some of the kids who grew up in Gospel where I lived. They're sort of like the state of them, to be honest.
But yeah, I think I agree that I think it's sort of like I actually think the scholarship edition factor of it, the thing I was thinking playing it now was, did you actually need all of this extra content? I don't know if it's a game that gains by adding more stuff to it. I think if you subtract, as the PS2 version did, maybe you do get the optimal version of it.
A couple of things I do like about the Christmas mission in the scholarship edition, but I think a lot of the best stuff is, most of it is in the PS2 stuff. And then, there's a bit too much extraneous repetitive missions in the second half.
I think I had a slightly rosier version of it in my memory.
Right, right.
And this often happens when I go back and play things. Like, they've just aged a bit, or some of the attitudes have aged a bit, and I was kind of less keen on them. I still had a really good time with it, but I was...
Where I once would have said Bully was just like a clear nine, I probably now think it's like a clear eight.
Yeah, yeah, I don't think that's necessarily unfair. I think I felt like a little similiar. So probably of all the different playthroughs I've done, and I think the last one was actually in the pandemic at some point.
I had a play... It might have been on 360, actually. It does feel like a while ago, but I did everything right down to getting the elastic band ball, which is like the...
Oh, shit, I mean, that's got big COVID energy. You beating up virtual children locked in your flat.
This was in... I think actually it might even have been before that, but I got the Â£99 Xbox One eBay deal at the end of 2019, which was well worth it to go back and play some games they added a backwards compatibility for. And yeah, Bully was one of the first ones I fired up.
I think that's when I last played it. And yeah, I think it has dated to all those reasons. The other thing I do think about this game is I think it is probably better played over a longer period of time than we played it for this episode.
I think the seasonal aspect of it is designed to pace it out. So you do a bunch of missions and then you kind of come back and then you come back and maybe play it over like four weeks as opposed to one week as each of us did. So I think that maybe it magnifies the flaws to play through it that quickly.
So that's true. But yeah, otherwise I think I kind of agree. It's sort of like it's got inevitable rougher edges from being a bit older, but there's still bits of it that I feel very warmly about as we'll talk about Matthew.
So a bit of wider context on this game. This was a controversial game at the time for its subject matter, being set in a school and Rockstar were obviously fresh from a bunch of GTA related controversies at the time. The usual politicians weighed in in the UK.
The title in Power Regions was changed to Canis Canum Edit. So I found some context to this, Matthew. At the time, MP Keith Vaz, I believe this was in 2005, asked the House of Commons leader Jeff Hoon the question, Do you share my concern at the decision of Rockstar to publish a new game called Bully, in which players use their on-screen persona to kick and punch other school children?
Will you ask the Prime Minister to refer this video game to the BBFC? If they don't make any changes, will the government use its powers to ban this video? Sounds like somebody's got the moral higher ground there.
Just going to look at his Wikipedia page. Let's see. Allegations about Vaz were published by the British tabloid Sunday Mirror in early September 2016.
It was reported that he had engaged in unprotected sexual activity with male prostitutes and told them he would pay for cocaine if they wished to use it. He told the prostitutes that his name was Jim and that he was an industrial washing machine salesman. Vaz later apologized for his actions and resigned as the chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee on the 6th of September 2016.
So, yeah, I just wanted to add some context there about people in Parliament were actually talking about this game, which is quite notable. Do you think this would be controversial if it was released now?
What a mad bit.
Do you think I went too far there?
No, I was curious where it was going. It was like, oh, yeah, I knew he'd done something, but I couldn't remember what it was.
Sorry if you think I went too far there. I just thought it was too funny not to do. I just had the words.
Sounds like someone with a moral high ground in my head. I just wanted to read that out. So glad you enjoyed that.
Matthew, what do you think of the signature missions or moments from this game?
I really liked Halloween night, leading up to the big prank. Just the idea of trying to capture a seasonal event. You come out of your dorm room, and you have to do X number of pranks in an evening, and there's just, you know, as you walk over the school grounds, there are loads of different people and they're, you know, they're asking you to, like, you know, throw different, trip up three people with marbles or, you know, give a guy a wedgie or whatever.
And if you do enough of those, you can then pull off, like, the big prank at the end of the evening. And I just like that it had a very clear, like, Halloween beat in it. And the way I remembered this game, every season had an event like this, which it actually doesn't.
That isn't true at all. This is really the only thing like it. But I kind of like that, you know, it's like, stop what you're doing.
It's Halloween. Let's just do this mad shit for an evening. That's cool.
I love any seasonal event in this because the scale of it means that they get to change the NPCs up around the school, give them costumes for one mission only or one era only. And that's just great. That's a character you just don't find in any other game.
You'll never see that in a Rockstar game again. It's too much work to do that shit. But yeah, I love that.
I love that, too.
It's kind of it's almost like the OG Pat the Ox scene. Yeah, going around giving people wedgies. So maybe we should call it like change Pat the Ox to wedge even nerd.
Pat the Ox is just such a good kind of like shorthand.
It's a bit kinder.
It is a little bit kinder. Other sort of highlights, a few of mine. So I do think the funfair mission is great.
Like the date.
Yeah, I picked that out as well. Yeah.
It's just really nicely portrayed. I know that the characters like, you know, she is depicted as a thing to be one. But it is just quite sweet how you go around just doing all these funfair games and then trying to win tickets and just have quite a nice night.
And I think in its best moments, this game feels like you're creating the kind of cherished young memories that you reflect on when you had like a nice night with some friends or something notable happened. Or I know you were hanging out with this girl you liked or whatever. Like I think it it just at its best, Bully taps into that so, so well.
I hated the funfair so much when I was a kid. Not the funfair in this game. I was nodding along with it and what you were saying.
And it reminded me that whenever the funfair came to town, I would always stay at home in protests. I thought it was dangerous. What my family went.
So dangerous. Like what was dangerous about it?
It had dangerous, like those funfair rides that put up in like five hours and taken down in five hours. I'm not getting on one of those things.
Yeah, I get you. I feel a little bit like that older I get them. If I went, if there's a funfair now, I think it's also maybe watching the Stephen King adaptation The Dead Zone, where I'm like, oh, who knows what spooky shit could happen in one of these places.
But, you know, one year infamously, someone died at the Osford Funfair. You know, the music machine?
Yeah.
Where you have like a row of seats and then they kind of spin round against a backdrop. It wasn't someone on the ride. It was the guy operating the ride.
It like clipped him. Right. But because of that, I just had it in my head.
Like, the Oxford Fun Fair is where people die. So I never, ever wanted to go to it. And I would try and talk my family out of it because I thought they were all going to die at the fun fair every year.
Very traumatic memories.
When my mum grew up in Mansfield, she told me that when she was a kid, there was this, you know, when all those kind of like chairs float in the air and spin round, like you just sit in a chair.
They're like hanging from chains.
Yeah, that's right. She said that like one someone died because one of those like flew off at full speed with a kid on it and like went down Mansfield like town centre and they just just died from that. And so I agree like who is who is actually like watching these things.
Like it's not, you know, it's it's a different thing going to somewhere like Disneyland or whatever. Like, oh, yeah, like those that those feel like legitimate, they have stringent safety checks, they shut them for hours when they have to fix things. But just a slightly rusty looking thing that rolls up in gospel.
I do agree. There's a little bit of, yeah, I think I kind of I'm a bit in the bit of a cautious, cautious person like you in that respect, Matthew.
Yeah, but the funfair here seems very safe. Do you think the funfair carnival games are actually fun or are they rubbish in this?
I think like some of them are quite funny. I like the one where you just have to hit the target and dunk the guy in the water. Like I think that's funny because he's like razzing you and then you just do it.
That's good. They're all kind of a bit rudimentary, I guess. I guess they're not all great, but I like the fact that they use the existing mechanics a bit.
There's some shooting, there's some throwing. They're okay. Collectively, they're some of the less offensive one-off content you do in the game.
I was very bad at them. And so the only way I could get enough tickets to get my date a prize was just to do the strength test over and over again because that one's just like a mash the button which anyone can do. So I gave up on the shooting gallery and was just like, right, we're doing this five times in a row.
So it wasn't like a great date for her. But I completed it.
Yeah, I get that. There's other missions I like. Okay, so I do like the Christmas one where you're destroying Santa Claus' display and then loads of his elves come and fight you to stop you from doing it.
That's good. Actually, one other thing to point out is that some of these missions are slightly busted by the FPS boost on Xbox. I don't know if you noticed this, Matthew, but there's a few missions where you have to collect things and you automatically have some of the things in your inventory.
That's like one thing that happens. There's also weird things like when Jimmy sits down in a class, he sort of spins around in his chair when he sat down.
Yeah, I saw that a lot.
That wasn't in the 360 version originally. That's like a that's a framerate boost problem. There's a snowball mission in this game.
We have to chuck snowballs at some kids riding by on BMXs that is genuinely busted unless you like hit the pause menu every now and then.
I hated that one.
Yeah, that's all. I did it first time because I had read there was a problem with this, but apparently the FPS boost just being like switched on, which does make the game look nicer obviously. It does just break a few things in this game that weren't broken before.
So that's one thing. I like the Santa one. I like it when you tag City Hall.
That's quite fun. Yeah, like the raid on the nerds observatory. I quite like that.
I like as well when you have to defend the observatory from people attacking the nerds and they all come and smash it down the jocks and you get on like the potato cannon and shoot them off like that. That all feels a little bit more like an advanced kind of like Rockstar sort of mission to me.
Yeah, I thought the one where you steal the cow mascot uniform and then sabotage the football team felt quite substantial and fun. It has a bespoke little mini game for whenever anyone gets too close to you in the cow uniform, you can lower their suspicion by doing this stupid like team dance for them, which is pretty throwaway. But I like the idea of it, that everyone was kind of satiated by your stupid dance and be like, that was brilliant and then walk off.
And then also I like the fact that all of them see you as like the whipping boy, they're all like, yeah, we beat up the mascot because it's funny. And that too adds a bit of fun sort of texture to that bit. Those are some highlights.
A lot of the kind of like the rest of them sort of like blur together or like I like specific bits of cut scene or going through like a town, going through like a bit of the town or whatever. Anything else that jumps out, Matthew?
Like there's a turret section where you sit on the back of a bike and shoot loads of greases. That's okay.
Oh yeah, that's good. Yeah, yeah. That probably this probably does speak to the fact that like there are only really five or six signature missions in the game though.
And then the rest are like you're sort of rinse and repeat, go here, hit these enemies sort of thing. Like the kind of like repetition of Rockstar objectives that we were talking about. Really, really curious to see how GTA 6's mission design pushes on from five as well because that's something where the world of games probably changed quite significantly since even Red Dead 2 with how that stuff is like designed and handled.
So I guess we will see, Matthew. Okay. And ultimately, do you think this is still worth playing now, Matthew?
Yeah, I'd say is an interesting riff on GTA with like an extra weird layer of sort of school simulation. I think it's got something going for it. I think if you haven't played it before, like playing through it once is fine.
If you have played it before and you've got a happy memory, it's okay to leave that memory locked away. You don't necessarily need to re-evaluate it.
Yeah, you can just hear two dweebs talking about it on a podcast and said, we did the work so you don't have to, basically. I agree. I think it's still worth playing now.
I think it is easier if you've got that grounding with old Rockstar games. I think that if you just play GTA 5, they went back and played this, then it might be a bit of a steep cliff to climb. But like I say, I think it ages well in some ways, like the combat and the general interactions around the game.
I still feel pretty good now because the difficulty curve is a lot softer, and the melee combat is so well done compared to the PS2 GTAs even. It's miles along from what those games did with their very basic punching and kicking. It's got a lot more going on.
Building the game around that is such a great choice. And yeah, it's the fact as well that there still aren't that many games that are set in schools. You know, obviously, aside from your personas and the like, I don't really know where you go to find an experience that's comparable to this.
I think one of the reasons this was voted for by our listeners is because it's a real one-off in the history of blockbuster games, you know? And indeed, Rockstar never revisited it, never made a sequel. So, yeah, I agree, Matthew.
Still worth playing now, but with some caveats. Matthew, shall we take a quick break and come back with some slightly more detailed observations and maybe some discussion about our pass in school?
Yeah, let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, we have a tiny bit more discussion about some of the more particular school elements of this game, and then we're going to talk a bit about our lives as young men. I'm sure that's such interesting content to some people.
And maybe just drawing some sort of like through lines from this game to us, which I think is a fun thing to discuss, Matthew. I'm sure it'll provoke some interesting memories. So, I did want to talk about one character.
So, I think when people discuss this game, more than Jimmy, the protagonist, they talk about Gary, the antagonist, because he is kind of a one-off. He's a villain I've not really seen done in the same way anywhere else. He is this sociopathic kid who I think has ADD or ADHD, he mentions in the game.
He's certainly got some stuff he's dealing with, but his whole thing in the game is that he is basically like the puppet master between all these different factions. He seems like he's your friend, and then he's like sort of super paranoid as an individual, and then like basically turns on you at the end of the game's first chapter. And then the rest of the game, he's like behind the scenes, so waiting to emerge from the shadows.
And yes, eventually this plan comes to fruition, where confusingly he somehow turns all the factions against Jimmy. But he is a great character. I think he feels maybe more real as a kid than Jimmy does.
Like I feel like I've met this kid before, or maybe I am even this kid a little bit. Oh really? We'll get to this, but there's a tiny bit of theâ¦
You know how paranoid I am Matthew. You've had so much of my paranoia over the years. What I'm saying really is that there's a truth in this character that I think makes him stand out as a sort of Rockstar antagonist.
There are entire GTAs that don't have characters anywhere near this good.
Yeah, I think it's the fact that he isn't tied to a specific faction. There is a general bullies faction which I think he probably is part of, but he's kind of a lone wolf in the school and seems to be a bit of a free agent which makes him a great tutorial device to begin with because he can go anywhere in the school and antagonise anyone and introduce you to all those different groups. But in a world where people are largely defined by their faction, right down to their clothes, their voices and attitudes, they're all pretty universal.
It's maybe one of the weaknesses of that faction design. Gary is just interesting for not being that, and completely motivated by his own aims. I do think it's a shame that he disappears for so much of the game.
He's basically gone from the turn at the end of the first act till the very end, where, I don't know, if they fix some of the problems I had with that final stretch of it, and maybe kind of reintroduced him a little bit, and had him kind of bring you down more through an act of hubris, rather than he just brings you down somehow. It doesn't really do him justice when I think you are right. He's a pretty good character, and gets quite a good end.
Not mechanically, he's pretty basic, but the boss fight at the end, it's quite cinematic. It feels like the game is about Jimmy and Gary, which I like as a focus.
Yeah, I think that's a good observation about he's out of the story for a bit too long. You get little bits and pieces every now and then where Jimmy and Pete will be talking, they'll be like, Gary, and they'll realize he's behind something, but you don't see him for such a long time. Yeah, I agree.
When you see Gary interacting with other kids and taunting them, that's really effective, and you almost wish you could see him interact with those other factions and just belittle them in his weird way. There's a bit at the start where he just says, what's your problem to some kid after basically berating him? This is something so real about him.
So I agree, more of him would have been good, but the way they draw focus back to it at the end is quite strong. And it's a fact as well that Gary is set up to succeed. He's meant to be the kid who succeeds and goes off to be...
That's one of the jokes about the school, right? Is that people go off and be really successful, but also become criminals and arms dealers and all this stuff. And so there's a bit of class commentary in that as well, of we're forging the next generation of rich bastards here, basically.
And Gary encompasses that in some ways, whereas Jimmy is this ne'er-do-well underdog. So yeah, that contrast is interesting. So what do you make of the different factions and how they're portrayed, Matthew?
You mentioned that some of them get a bad hand, particularly the nerds. Do you sort of like the fact that they do this? Because I think it does bring a lot of the character to the game, even if some of them, but like you say, don't make any sense even in 2006, you know?
Yeah, I like that each chapter has a faction you're trying to bring down, and it gives you good reason to go to a different area of the map, and it gives like a little arc to each one. You know, yes, I have the problem with the actual faction non-system, but that's fine. I think a thing I do think is quite odd about it is I wouldn't have done them in this order.
I would have ended with the preppies because they are presented as kind of like the rich kings of the school. They are the more traditional top of the food chain, and they're the second chapter in this. And once they're done, like, I don't know, something about following the preppies with the greases and then the townies, they just feel like weird adults outside of the school.
Is that near picking? I don't know.
No, I think that's fair. It's also weird how you kind of ally with the nerds and then have to fight the nerds again. That's kind of strange that that happens.
You sort of do things for them and then curdle with them and then they become your friends again. That's kind of confusing, you know?
Well, in the nerds, there's the big fat one.
Algy, Algernon.
Who's like flies are permanently busted because his trousers are straining so much.
And he's pissing himself constantly.
He seems like okay. He's like your nerd mate. But then there's this maniac one who's in charge.
He's a bit more mercurial and occasionally pushes them down the villain path and you have to deal with him every once in a while. So I feel like some of the nerds are okay. They've just got a bad leader.
Yeah. I've thought about these factions too much.
Well, I quite like the mission where that nerd guy is running for office. You've got to stop all those people from interrupting his speech. That's quite a nice idea for a mission.
Yeah, there's that thing of like the... I think Gary describes them as sneaky bastards at the start of the game. So basically it's easy to get on the wrong side of them because they're just not that sociable.
They have barriers to how they're able to socialise with people from being nerds basically. Yeah, I'm a bit ehh on the Greases as mentioned. I do like the music that kicks in when you fight them though.
That's quite fun. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, did your school have factions like this? This is a great cartoonish version of it, because I don't know that mine did really.
So, the closest we got to this was there were popular girls, there were popular guys, and the sporty guys were also the popular guys, really. They were the same sets of people.
Oh, so they were the faction, just the popular people and the less popular.
They were, and some of them were nice, and some of them were like total bastards. And that was interesting as well, because kids who were like Ler and the Social Rungs, myself included, would be a bit wary of how they dealt with them, or how those interactions went. But the other factions, the factions are a bit more in this sort of vein.
So, there were goth kids at our school. That's observed by the 21 Jump Street Channing Tatum thing. But that definitely existed, like kids with greasy black hair who wore corn sweaters and stuff, sorry, not sweaters, hoodies.
That's the term I'm looking for, hoodies. And then there were what we described as the drugies, who were just these kids who sweat and smoked in Stanley Park next to our school, which is Bayhouse School in Gosport. And if the football went near them, we were playing at lunchtime, they just wouldn't give it back.
They'd kick it among themselves. And they might try and start a fight if you tried to get it back. But for some reason, they sat in the corner of the cage where everyone played football and just like hung out, just standing there.
That's a weird crossover of... You wouldn't expect that of the smokers, given their reduced lung capacity, that they would have athleticism in them.
Yeah. The one who was always the most aggressive was this slightly fat guy who had outdated David Beckham curtains.
He just had this jacket that was on way too tight, and his arms were tucked inwards slightly. He's a bit of an odd looking guy, but he was quite scary. I knew this kid, I won't say his name, I guess, but he went up to that group one lunchtime with, I think, a 10 pp piece and said, how many drugs can I buy for this?
They chased him through the entire school as he ran to the head of year, basically office in order to not be beaten up by these kids. But it was one kid who happened to be a very good athlete running away from 20 kids chasing him, basically. Very, very funny.
But that sort of thing was there, but it was less subcultures and more divided by popularity. Does that make sense? Do you have that kind of thing?
I'd say the hierarchy in our school was more about year group. The older you were, you got dibs on the best places to hang out. And the year 11s were kings of the school and the year 7s were the little wimps.
I think because of that, you'd project onto the older years that they were tougher and meaner, regardless of whether they were. They weren't many bullies in our school. I went to a very, very middle class, countryside town school.
I was probably a meaner person there, to give you an indicator of what things were like.
Wow.
There was a sort of frizzle of danger that came with the year 11s, just because they were so much bigger than you, that you felt like, well, I better not mess with these guys. I remember being in the IT room once and laughing. A guy sitting behind me telling a funny story to his mates, about something he'd done to, I don't know, Nick, someone's trainers, and I laughed at his anecdote, and he got really cross with me for listening to their story.
And that was like an early wake-up call as like a year seven to like, when the year 11s are talking, that's none of my business.
I mean, it is crazy that year 7s are even in the same school as year 11s. Why didn't junior school extend to include year 7s? No one hits puberty in year 7.
They all hit puberty in year 8.
Well, that's a difference between a 16-year-old and an 11-year-old. It's so vast.
It's like different species, basically. So, yeah, that's just really... I don't understand why they would just keep you in infant school until year 3, and then junior school could be year 4 to year 7.
Surely that makes more sense than having tiny kids next to basically blokes with beards. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, that's funny.
I was curious what you made of the teachers in this, Matthew. Do you think they're a realistic bunch? Do they recall any of yours?
I actually quite like the teachers in this.
Me too.
They're all slightly sad characters and leave sorry lives. But I do like that the game draws a line from kid bullies to adult bullies. That ecosystem never really goes away.
There are certain teachers who are meaner to other teachers and get their comeuppance. There are teachers who lack backbone and the things that begin in childhood obviously carry forwards when you're an adult. I think that's definitely in the mix in this game.
I also just like the dynamic that you occasionally happen upon the teachers in their private lives or you help out in their private lives in a very unrealistic way that they'd ever ask this kid to do favors for them. But there was a real thrill in realizing that your teachers had adult lives outside of school. If you ever saw a teacher in town or at the cinema or something, I'm always referring to this scene.
It's like that bit in The Wire where the drug dealers end up at the school at the cinema with the police officers who are stalking them every day and they have a weird kind of like, all right, this is neutral territory. You'd have that with teachers. I remember being on the train with a geography teacher and it feeling really odd that on the train we are peers.
We are train peers. We are both travelers. Normally, our dynamic is very clear-cut.
Like, you are the authority figure, but that doesn't really exist outside of school.
Yeah, a very well-observed episode of The Simpsons is when Skinner loses his job at the school and Bart becomes his friend. He's wearing a jumper and he's at that vending machine for washing up powder and he's just reading out all the brands. And then they're just sort of like this.
This is Bart doesn't quite know how to interact with him. And that's kind of what it feels like. I always felt bad for two of the teachers at my school because they lived two doors down from where my parents did.
And I did wonder if they saw it as like the Bedley Hillbillies moved in when we moved into that street because I was a right little shit in like her geography class, the female teacher. I was like throwing pencils at kids at the back row because I just didn't give a shit about geography. And it was year nine and it seemed funny.
I sat next to my mate James Yule and all we did was just chuck things at people we thought was hilarious.
Oh, you fucking prick.
So they probably hated that they had to live on the same street as me and politely say hello to me. But yeah, I think they're well observed. Like they really do recall, they are slightly archetypal but sometimes feel so real, they must be based on real things.
So the art teacher, Ms. Phillips, a touch I really like is when you do the art class, which is actually the slightly weird kind of like, is it a riff on like an old arcade game, Matthew? But you've got to like draw lines to reveal a larger picture.
Or something?
Yeah, something like that. It's definitely one of the more successful, interesting things they do. It's quite tricky.
But basically the drawing, each drawing is of Ms. Phillips, a teacher, and Jimmy draws her in this very adoring kind of way, these quite sweet kind of like portraits basically. And it's revealed in like a cut scene later on that he does have a crush on her, and he thinks that she likes him because he's quite naive and it's sweet kid stuff really. But like that teacher and the way she's dressed really did remind me of the art teachers at my school.
That's been well observed. So too does the English teacher, whose name I can't remember now actually, the one who's dating the Miss Phillips. He's a slightly boozy English teacher.
I had an English teacher almost exactly like that guy. Like it really just went with the elbow, the leather elbows and stuff like that, like on the jacket. It just, they feel very, a lot of them feel very real.
So I like that about the game too Matthew.
Yeah, and it taps into the romance between the teachers and the idea of that seeming quite like scandalous or eye opening. If discovering their private lives outside of school was radical, realizing that two teachers were like dating or going to get married or something, that was just like crazy because it felt like you really had some dirt on them. You didn't of course, but I definitely remember thinking that.
Yeah, because that definitely did happen with a few of my teachers. It's sort of like, you don't have much else to think about in school. So that's the sort of thing you'd be like, wow, I can't even imagine them being like, what do they do when they hang out or whatever?
Yeah.
Were you friendly with any of your teachers?
Yeah, I got on really well with my English teachers. In some ways, I think that the personalities of the teachers I clicked with determined the subjects I was best at because, weirdly, maybe I need that in a mentor or something. But English teachers, I felt like I had a lot of affinity with.
And it's interesting, the subject I was the best at that I then got bad at, at A level, was I went from an A at GCSE for history to a D. And I think that was because I switched teachers to this teacher I thought was fucking appalling at her job. And I just could not get along with her at all.
And I don't think she did any teaching. All she did was write shit on the board every day. And I realised that maybe it was the dynamics I had with the teachers that were part of why I thrived in some subjects and then didn't in others, which is ridiculous and definitely partly on me.
But yeah, like I got on with some of them. And yeah, the game has a little bit of that. Like it's interesting that the teachers sort of don't see you as an equal, but like they don't all write you off either.
They don't all see you as like the little shits basically. You know, how about you?
Yeah, I had a similar sort of thing. Like there were teachers who had a very, you know, they just clearly saw you just as like pupils and seemed colder as a result. And then there were some that treated you, you know, more as humans and you got on with them.
There was a geography teacher at my school called Mr. Clark, who lived in the same village that I lived in just outside of the town where my school was. And so I had, I felt like some affinity just because we lived in the same place. That's just weird kid logic, but in my head, that was a thing.
But we used to have geography lessons at the end of a couple of days. And you might just hang around for five minutes just to kind of chat. This guy seemed a bit more kind of interested in what we were up to.
And yeah, he was really nice. I had lots of nice teachers. I was really lucky where I grew up and the school I went to was incredibly safe.
There weren't many like really mean characters. The teachers were generally really nice and good. A few of them, I think, oh, I'd love to kind of get in touch with them.
And sort of let them know that I, you know, like my English teacher, that I did go on to do writing or whatever. But then another bit of my brain goes, oh, maybe I should try and do something amazing, like actually get a book published or something and then talk to them.
Got a podcast?
Yeah. Well, I mean, the concept of a podcast just wouldn't have existed back then. So like the idea of, I don't know if that would mean anything.
I don't know what lessons put me in good stead for podcasting. Drama, maybe. My drama teacher died like 10 years ago, so I'm not sure I could.
Yeah. Like generally, nice bunch. But like there were, like you remember a lot.
There were the ones you liked and then there were ones who've just remained caricatures in my head.
Right.
Which is kind of what this game taps into. The teachers are these big broad characters. Like we had a music teacher who all I remember about him was that his armpits of his shirts were incredibly green, from like wearing the same shirt too often.
They've just gone green over time from like the sweat. So there was like the green armpits music teacher. We had an IT teacher called Mrs. Colbeck.
And all I remember about her is one time she was moving a whiteboard and it wasn't secured properly. And it swung around and crushed her fingers. And it looked like the most painful thing ever.
And she screamed and we all laughed because kids are fucking horrible. But like, I just remember her as like the lady who crushed her fingers in the whiteboard.
Yeah.
And that's all you are, unfortunately. Like that's how these things work in the teenage mind.
It's true, actually. Yeah. Like someone just gets sort of filed away in amber as like in one moment or wherever.
But yeah, there's definitely the, you definitely get some like real characters. That's what I kind of like about, even though the gym teacher in this is reprehensible, his voice is really funny. Like he's sort of like, he's like, all right, I'll get into the way he shouts to you and stuff like that.
And that is quite evocative of what some PE teachers were like. We had this one history and geography teacher called Mr. Bradford, who was also then like he was sometimes a PE teacher as well.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that happened a lot, yeah.
Yeah. And he was, because I think he was just in slightly better shape than the other teachers. Maybe he knew how to teach PE, I don't know.
But he was northern and he just did this thing where if people were talking too much, he just went, hey, shut up. And then he just kind of carry on with it. And then sometimes he just, he'd smack a ruler against the table just for a laugh.
And do funny faces at people. And yeah, those are the kind of things that end up defining the characters you stay, your teachers you stay in your memory. And then the others are just sort of consigned to like, I don't really remember that this music teacher being particularly distinctive or whatever.
But there's like five or six who really wedge in your brain and the game's really good at raising those memories out of you. I was curious, Matthew, if you thought that any of the Ballworth NPCs had our energy. I think, like I say, I think I'm a little bit of Jimmy's working class chip on his shoulder and a little bit of sociopath Gary.
I think I'm like a sort of like a meeting of the two in some ways. Probably with one of like the nerdy kids thrown in as well. But what do you think?
Do you identify with anyone in this game?
Worryingly, if there's anyone, probably like probably Ernest, the geek, the bad geek in terms of like, like very nerdy in terms of my interests, but also with a slight superiority complex in our school. I guess there was a faction, a tiny bit of, definitely a friendship group of people in like the higher sets at school.
Right.
I don't know if we kind of considered ourselves to be, you know, it was never spoken at the time, but we were obviously like drawn together as peers because we were all quite bright people. I used to be a bit more sort of snobbish about that kind of stuff. I used to kind of look down on people who weren't necessarily as sharp.
It's not a very nice trait of my teenage self admittedly. And I, you know, I hope I don't do that anymore. I strive not to do that anymore.
But like a geek, but not, but not sort of too constrained by social embarrassment, you know, can be a slightly dangerous thing. Yeah.
Yeah. I think that's...
And that is Ernest in this game. I'm not a pervert like Ernest. Interesting thing about Ernest.
This is like a wild theory and I bet it's absolutely nothing.
Go on.
So he's like campaigning. He's like, you know, he is the bad nerd and he has these banners with an E on them. And it is the edge E from that period.
Oh, no, you don't think so, really?
I looked at it and was like, I wonder, just because it's the nerds. I wondered, you know, if someone, somewhere had thought...
Quite similar, isn't it? When you look it up.
It just has a very, like, early edge.
That's great speculation.
And it is, absolutely. It just popped into my head when I was playing. I thought, that's like the E of edge.
And if anyone in this game, you were going to slam as being a bit like edge, it might be like nerds over like uppity.
But there's also a very obvious kind of like swastika riff they're going for with that as well.
Well, there is that as well. So it's probably that. But I just, anyway.
No, no, no.
I jotted it down in my notes. I thought, is this edge magazine?
But what if it's both, Matthew? What if it's deliberately both? I mean, speculation will just make that very clear.
But if you check out, look up Ernest in Bully and Political Banner. Yeah, I can see that.
That's interesting. Yeah, I didn't want to sort of like bait you into saying you were like one of the nerds, but I was just curious to see where you would land on that scale.
I was a school librarian, so I was very nerdy.
I think my observation about me being quite Gary-like is true. I'm kinder than Gary for sure. But I didn't really see myself anywhere else in this.
When you left school, did you do that thing where everyone signs like a leaver shirt?
Yeah, I did. I had the shirt and then I lost it after a certain point. I don't know what happened to it.
Yeah, I don't know. I don't think I've got mine anymore. I was just curious if the vibes were good on that shirt.
They were okay. I think when I was a very self-serious young man, and I remember writing a lot of very heavy stuff in people's yearbooks. So it wasn't really a fun hang in those yearbooks.
So I think I probably wrote, I'm just quite sincere about it. I don't know, I remember it seeming quite quietly devastating when school ended, like when it was the end of year 11. It was just so firmly the end of something.
I think it was like the day after, we still had exams to go, I think. It was the day after the prom and all these kids were hung over because they were 16 but we all went to the beach and got drunk after the prom. Then it was like this thing of like we're not all going to be in the same place again.
Actually weirdly for some reason I had a camera with me and I took like five photos from the day and like each one is like this little portal into what that day was like. All these kids, these blue Bayhouse school shirts, like some girls crying and some guys stood around and a picture of me next to like four of the people who were in my tutor group on like our last day and all hung over and like yeah, it was oddly melancholy but I realized with a bit of looking back that a lot of kids weren't very nice to me and I wasn't very nice to a lot of kids and it wasn't really much cop. It's just that at that time those memories seemed more important because you haven't had any adult memories yet to surpass them but obviously you eventually do and then you don't really dwell on it that much.
I never really think about school now. Does any of that ring true to you?
Yeah, I definitely felt like I was going from a place where I knew what my place was because it was quite a small school and over five years, which is a long time to be in one place, you can very clearly lay out who you are as a person and how you're perceived. Then we got absorbed into a sixth form college with 2,000 people or whatever, and you're suddenly like a nobody and just couldn't ever get a foothold in the two years at college to leave any kind of mark where I felt like I was relatively well known, not to pick myself up or anything, but I was liked by the people I was liked and I felt like I had more of a footprint at secondary school than I ever did at college, that's for sure. Yeah.
So giving up that was quite sad and quite hard, but weirdly, I just do better in smaller environments. After college, university was great for me, and then being in the workplace was great for me. When there's 50 people, I can find my place a bit better.
Yeah.
I know what you mean actually, because I felt quite anonymous when I went to college. I hated college. I liked school and I was academically successful, then I went to college and I was not successful at all, and I hated it, and I hated how the people I knew from school were behaving in college.
I felt like they all thought they were adults now because they had weekend jobs in ASDA.
That's a real heartbreaker when your mates change.
Yeah. It does happen and they kind of contrive it to change, but I was still buying official PS2 magazine and all this stuff. Yeah, that's it.
But then that funny thing happened where then I turned 18, and I sat around my parents' house for six months, and I became a staff writer and then found my place again. Do you know what I mean? It's interesting how you go through those phases in life.
Yeah, I think you do adjust to your surroundings or whatever, but yeah, I definitely had some affection for school, and this game is quite successful at triggering those memories. The one last thing I did want to ask about, Matthew, was is there anything in this game that... Do you think this game is good at evoking the slight wonder of being a kid?
Do you think it's true to that experience? Things like finding shortcuts through your town, pissing off adults and riding off, going to the fun fair, watching an asshole kid get beaten up. Did you have an experience like that in Winchester?
Did you and Alexa Chung go to the fair?
That's the key question. No, I had no friendship with Alexa Chung outside of doing one school play with her, so I really cannot sell that. I mean, God, I wish I would have gone to the fun fair with anyone.
Actually, I wouldn't have because I found it dangerous.
Met Gala with you and Alexa Chung is a funny thought.
Yeah, but it's also, weirdly, it's not an impossible thing that could happen. It's the tiniest, it's like 0.000000, but it could happen.
Yeah.
As a joke, I don't know anyway.
Yeah, that's what I like about this game. It's not like directly all the things that happened to me as a kid, but it just reminds me of all the different events that make up a childhood and how those string together in your head is these mini-narratives and then a larger narrative.
I think it is true. I had quite a sheltered childhood. I wasn't a very adventurous kid and I was very well-behaved.
I was just quite generically good and worked hard at school. I didn't make the most of my... I went home and played video games all evening.
You know, I wasn't out on my bike having like mad adventures. So a lot... Not a lot of this game does parallel what I did.
You know, there are flashes of things where I think, oh, that's 100% true. Like I said, the occasional flashes of friendship with a teacher, you know, or everyone coming together for a particular seasonal event or, you know, things like that did happen and could like override whatever social strata existed at our school. But like, it's total escapism really in terms of what it promises and, you know, did I do many of these things?
Yeah.
Trying to think if anything ever wild or anything really exciting ever happened to us. But, you know, I think there were people who did. You know, there were people who were more adventurous and probably were a bit more Jimmy-esque going off on, you know, their BMXs to interesting fields and that's all you could really do.
You could be in town or you could go to a field and maybe something would happen there. But yeah, it was pretty tame. I feel like you had a slightly kind of fuller school experience than I did.
Well, I think it's because the school was massive. Like it was a school. We had like 12 tutor groups of 30 kids each just in my year.
Yeah, and then there were five years and then there was a sixth form on top of that. So what's that like close to, actually I'm terrible at maths, but it's like what 2,000, 3,000 kids, something like that. Like it's a lot of kids were running around.
So within that, you have quite a lot of people from different backgrounds in there. People who are slightly better off, people who are very, very poor and who's living like borderline slums around the hometown.
Yeah.
Bridge Mary, Gosport, like there's some quite rough places around there. I think that as a result means you just encounter a lot of different types of character. Like playing Bully, one experience that reminded me of actually is the night of our prom.
There was like a fight on a beach between these 2 kids, and one kid got punched in the face so hard that his hat went flying off and I caught his hat while he fell down on the beach and I just sort of was holding this hat. And then someone just turned to me and went, Samuel, get rid of that hat. And then I just sort of like chucked it.
And I was sort of like evidence, things like that. Or like I had like a mini sort of like rivalry with another paperboy at one point. It was a year older than me.
I was sort of like chasing after me during my rounds. And then there was this kid we called Pigface, who had this kind of like weird nose. And he for a while like we kept having these run ins with him.
And then all these times where like we were getting chased by these, by like a old bloke who's like a footballer, been in his garden too many times. He was, man, he was mad. So he started chasing us.
And just like times he got into all these like mini fights or ran away from something, or had a big water fight in the park with all these super soakers and stuff. Like I had like a lot of stuff that was sort of like bully adjacent, I would say.
Yeah, it's interesting, Archie, I was going to ask you whether you had an enemy. That would have been a good, you know, given how many enemies Jimmy has. Was your newspaper boy your biggest enemy?
And that's sort of for a while. This is like when I was 13 or so. And then like he became, weirdly, we both started working at the same one stop, like a few years later.
And he was like, he was actually like great fun. He stopped being a dick and was like really fun guy. I would just start like, he would start like insulting all of the people who were coming in to like pay for their papers under his breath.
He'd just be like, motherfucker, like that basically, try and make me laugh.
Oh, God.
And like I was massively into that because they were all Tories.
I was massively into calling people motherfucker under my breath.
But he was just great fun. He just came in pissed. He would just tell me all these things about, oh, yeah, if something's going out of date, just like put it back there and then you can just take it the next day when you come in because it won't have been on the shelves for people to buy it so you can just have it.
And I got so many free French fancies that way. I talk about enemies, I had definitely suffered from some name calling at school. I had a bit of that, in a very minor way.
Some kids had it way worse. There was this kid who I tripped over during a football match and he punched me in the face like four times. That was likeâ¦
Oh, wow.
Yeah, that sort of seemed significant, but yeah.
I think Iâ¦ I know school wasn't violent any, I don't think I ever saw a single fight all the time I was there, but I definitely sort of painted a target on my back by being like overly prim and proper.
Right.
Like we had an optional jumper that you didn't have to wear. And I was like the only person, the only boy in how you did wear this jumper, because I thought it just made me look neater. I quite like that.
So like obviously you want to fuck with the jumper guy. I often joke about this at work. I may have even told this on the podcast, but do you remember, do you remember peanutting?
Not really, no.
So peanutting, like for people who haven't experienced this or just don't know it by this term. It's just when you pull someone's tie and it tightens the knot to make it really really hard to undo their tie.
We only had ties for one year when I was at school.
So we had ties, we had to wear ties all through secondary school. But if you pull their tie really fast, the knot would tighten and basically fuck their tie. And the idea was the knot was like a peanut, because it was tiny.
So it was called peanutting. But I devised this anti-peanut technique where I'd put a two pence piece inside the knot of my tie. And I thought this was just like the best king shit for having devised a way.
But then I think all it does is advertise that you're someone who has money in their tie, which is obviously going to appeal to people who want money. So that wasn't wise. There was a guy, weirdly, I think the nastiest people in our school probably were in the same top sets I was in.
They weren't stupid people, they were bright people, but they were just malicious. And there was one guy, I won't name him, I really, really hate his guts. Oh God.
So the worst fucking nickname is used to drive me up the wall. Yeah, Castle. Some people would say it rhymes with asshole.
Right, right.
Even though it doesn't, Castle and asshole, all and whole, it's not a true rhyme. Very frustrating trying to explain that to people when you're wearing a jumper and you've got a two pence piece in your tie. Well, actually, that's not a true rhyme, so it doesn't really work.
Like, no one wants to fucking hear it. And probably it just propagated it further. But this guy who was absolutely terrible for nicknames like that, I think he lives in Bath.
Right.
Like, I see him around, but I don't think he recognizes me at all. But every time I see him, like occasionally in Sainsbury's, I think, oh, it's that fucking prick I went to school with, who thought Castle rhymes with asshole, which doesn't. So yeah, fuck that guy.
Hope something awful happens to him. Apart from that, that's about as rough as it got. Some rhyming based name calling.
That's not too bad, yeah. There were some kids at my school who were just like really inventively kind of like cruel. And some of them, there was this like fat guy who I knew, who was, he was like, he was not, I think I might have even told this story before on the podcast, but he was not academically well performing.
I was in like junior school with him, then he went into second, same secondary school. He just, we had this like teacher called Mrs. Dennis. She was a French teacher and she referred to herself as like, she might even have been called Denny, but she referred to herself as Madame Denny and he called her Denny LaMennie.
And like that, that just seems so like pettily witty to me as a kid. And that stuck with me. And I've told other people that because it just stays with me.
And I always think that like that, that one joke means more than like him getting like B in geography or whatever. Like that's more important long term. I think the joy that's given me outweighs the importance of his academic achievement or lack thereof.
But yeah, similar like random thing that I often think of that stuck with me. I used to have a friend called Craig, very good friend of mine from secondary school. We were in a French lesson once and our teacher left the room to go and take a call or something.
And for some reason, my friend Craig had quite a booming voice.
Right.
And loads of people started doing like impressions of him saying, Oh, Craig, over and over again in really loud voices. And, you know, there were like 10 different people shouting, Oh, Craig. And then the French teacher suddenly like the door slams open.
The French teacher comes in, he's like, Craig Pierce, why are you making all that noise? That was clearly the voices of 10 different people. And why would he sit there shouting his own name?
I just thought that was like the greatest injustice. The idea that a very bright person would sit in a room yelling his own name over and over again, somehow echoing it simultaneously. But I love stuff like that.
Like it always makes me laugh when I think of it. I'm like, I wouldn't stop that moment from happening if I could go back in time.
Yeah, that's the thing. This may even have been a story I told on the podcast too. But again, it's something similar to Bully in some ways, is that there was this guy who I don't know what he taught, but he seems to be some head of discipline or something.
Like if you're in trouble, you went to Mr. Something's office and you would be disciplined. The time I got punched in the face four times, I got put in isolation and didn't go back to class the rest of the afternoon. Because he decided that by being punched, I was in the wrong somehow.
And it was like, no one sensible thinks that. This is a guy who just obviously resents kids. But the greatest thing that happened to that guy, there was this like real near do well as in he went to prison eventually kid in my school who wrote, Mr. This teacher's name is a C-U-N-T on the side of the drama hall, like spray painted it or like painted it or something.
And it was so good because everyone fucking hated this guy. And that felt very like Jimmy Hopkins to me. Do you know what I mean?
Like someone went, actually this guy, this guy's a motherfucker. So I'm just going to spray paint this here.
Bring him down.
Yeah, that's it. So that was, that's like a cherished memory of mine that this guy who like basically told me off for getting punched, this was the universe getting him back. So that was good.
Yeah, I don't know. It's sort of like, there's a sort of ferocity to bully that sort of is quite real.
I think an outright British bully set in like the nineties or the early noughties would actually probably be just like a bit too rough on people's ears for it to make the cut. I think it would be like just a little bit too ugly in its language.
It's funny you say that because I just like in the background while we were talking a few minutes ago, I was like looking up my old English teacher, she became the head teacher of the school and they've got like a needs improvement from Ofsted because apparently like the use of discriminatory language was like out of control in the school or something. That was like a thing and I was like that was a problem that was there then. The things people were saying in my school at that time like just out of control.
I can't imagine it getting like way better and if anything in an era people are pushing to be more PC. I guess people are responding to that by being worse. I didn't go to like the best school.
I think it's just like quite similar to any large-scale school experience in terms of the mix of people. But yeah, it is funny. A British Bully actually would have been like a great fit.
I'm sad there's no real spiritual successor to this. There was like an actual Bully 2 that was in development between 2008 and 2010. There's a great Game Informer piece on this.
You can still read on webarchive.org. Even though they say they made like six to eight hours of it, you still played as Jimmy and they were like these quite detailed character interaction stuff. I didn't ever really feel like I could get my arms around like what the idea of the sequel was.
I don't think they ever just quite got there and then and the age of the mega Rockstar game really happened in that HD era after Bully came out and it's kind of done. But those end all my Bully thoughts, Matthew. Is there anything else you wanted to ask about school stuff before we wrap up?
What do you think we're done?
I feel like we've shared enough traumas, more of these things as and when I have them. Actually, one thing just on pranking, because it again always makes me laugh, on the last day of school when the year 11s left, they'd sometimes prank the school and there was this charge in the era of anticipation at like, what are the year 11s going to do? And, you know, there'd be rumours in the lower years about like, maybe this is going to happen, or, you know, the teachers would go to the local shops to make sure they hadn't bought loads of eggs and things like that.
There was like a proper crackdown on like, let's make sure nothing kind of kicks off. And, like I say, I was a school librarian. I may have told this story on the podcast before.
Apologies if so, but I was a school librarian. The day came and went that the year 11's left. And a couple of days later, there was this terrible stink in the library, awful stench.
And the librarian, Mrs Wilkins, was like, there's got to be fish in this library. They've hidden it in a roof tile. They've done something.
These horrible year 11's have done something to the library. And as a student librarian, I obviously, you know, worked in the library and didn't want my place of work to be stinking of fish. And we spent ages trying to find this stench.
And we just couldn't find, like, what have they done? Where have they hidden it? Like, have they turned it into some kind of paste and spread it somewhere?
Because there was no physical fish in the library. You couldn't find anything. And then a couple of days later, we found out that what it actually was, was next to the library was the male staff toilets.
And one of the teachers had just blocked up the toilets with like a mega-turd, and that was stinking out the library. So, I just laughed. She was so cross at the Year 11s.
And it turns out it was just some fucking bastard she worked with.
And that's where the Year 11s real plan was revealed, and the art block was blown up with Semtex.
End film on that shot.
Yeah, that's good. I think that's a perfect note to wrap up with, Matthew. That was fun to fire through that.
No doubt this stuff will come up again at some point. We've got best games of 04 and 05 to do yet, so bound to come up. Thank you so much for supporting this podcast, and for all of the Patreon content that we make.
We obviously try and make it as good as possible, so hope this was enjoyable. That sounded like a lot of a waffle, didn't it? Can you tell it's Friday night when we're recording this?
Thank you to Michael BanyaBat for editing this, and you know where to find us on social media. So Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
