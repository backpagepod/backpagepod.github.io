Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello Matthew, we are approaching the end of the year. Are you feeling relief that this pod is almost banked, and therefore all the regular pods for the year are done?
Yeah, well not just that, I am a pod ahead. I have a pod for next year recorded.
Nice, can you tease what that is? Is that something we can give?
Well, I will say we finally got someone from the N64 NGC heritage of magazines. So for people who have been listening for four years, 200 episodes in the hope of hearing one of those guys, you're going to get it.
Nice.
And yeah, we had a good chat, talked about, well, some fun stuff, I won't spoil it. So yeah, only 51 to go in the new year.
Yeah, so that one's rolling out in February, I believe. Isn't it? We're keeping that in our back pocket.
So yeah, that to look forward to. We have a cool guest for January as well, from more of the Xbox mag side of things. So that's something to look forward to, a contemporary of me and Matthew.
So looking forward to speaking to that individual, should be fun. So yes, the podding never ends, but I mean, it will temporarily end after we record this monster of an episode, The Best Games of 2024. If you've been listening to the podcast, since its inception or even in the last year or so, you probably know that we do this once a year now.
We do our classic Chet and John's Reassuringly Finite Gaming Playlist countdown of 10 to 1, and discussing the games we like from the year basically. So it's going to be some meaty games chat, no doubt quite a long episode. I'm prepped for it.
I've eaten a big stack of chicken wings, Matthew, and I've got my Monster Energy drink on the go. So yes, I had one bit of pod admin to run past you before we get started actually. So we ran a poll on Patreon for the first XL, that is the XL tier on Patreon, like the Â£4.50 tier.
For January, we're going to do a game club episode where two giant men play a game. So if you want to play and then tune in to the episode, we're doing Bully Scholarship Edition. That won a poll beating I think Chrono Trigger and Deadly Premonition, which are in 2nd and 3rd place, Matthew.
So Rockstars Bully, we're going to be playing and discussing. I think that will be a fun episode in the new year. Which of the characters are you?
All the fun, the usual nonsense that we do. How are you feeling about that one?
Well, I wish to tell some school anecdotes about the bullying we either received or doled out.
Yep, a little bit of both in my case, I think. Ooh, spicy.
Yeah, looking forward to it. Not sure where I'm going to cram it in, but I will find time, you know, hopefully in the future we can do Chrono Trigger. I fancy doing a Chrono Trigger episode.
I saw some people voice the opinion that there was nothing new or interesting to be said about Chrono Trigger. You have little faith, I'm sure we could do it. But we've definitely got interesting things to say about bully.
I bet there aren't that many British podcasts about Chrono Trigger. I know that American journalists are obsessed with it, and so it's probably been on RetroNauts like eight times or something. But I feel like it's got to be a bit harder to come by in the UK where it doesn't really have the same heritage, you know?
Yeah, I think so, I think so.
Well, something to think about anyway. But Bully we're definitely doing in January, so look forward to that. We're also doing a bunch of GTA pods next year, spread out over next year.
So the first one will be Vice City, I think in March. So look forward to that. Two giant men play Vice City.
We're going to do San Andreas and GTA 4 as well. If they release GTA 6 next year, I guess that's the biggest if of next year. Then we'll do an episode on that game as well, obviously.
But for now, we've got 2024 to exercise, to destroy, to demolish, to say goodbye to, Matthew. So the big question, was 2024 a great year for games or merely a good one? Because there are no bad years for games anymore.
There are simply too many games for that to be possible.
Yeah. I think it started as a great year and maybe shifted into merely a very good one. By mid-year, I was looking at games that are jotted down for Game of the Year contenders.
I was thinking, you know what? This is already a pretty strong selection because we have this new trend now of February to March releases being excellent where they used to be pretty horrible. So yeah, that might be lots of games that particularly spoke to me.
Like a lot of my favorites were around this year but I've definitely like cooled off in the last few months. That may coincide with like a job change for me, you know, not being as intensely on it as I was. But generally speaking, you know, I feel like I've been doing a lot of mopping up for the last four months.
And you know, I've maybe, maybe like, maybe it's a year that lacks like the like one 10 out of 10 masterpiece.
Yeah, I think this is a bit of a year of eights and then maybe there's five or so nines as well, but maybe no tens, you know? Well, that's a personal opinion, but I think that's, I think that's the profile of the year, roughly.
Yeah, that feels fair. Like, you know, I think, yeah, I think my top of my list are all like, are probably like nines for me. Though actually one of them is, and I gave it an eight.
I may think it's a nine, but I gave it an eight for various reasons. But, you know, there hasn't been like a, you know, Tears of the Kingdom for me last year was just, well, there's no doubt, you know, this is, this is the best thing I've played in, you know, not just this year, but in a long time. I haven't had that reaction to anything.
It's made the list making process a little bit harder, because there's been like a lot of movement. I've had about five different number ones at different times. I feel like I've got some slightly contrarian, well, not contrarian, but alarming things missing from my list that I'm hopefully going to be able to justify and that won't annoy you too much.
But it all comes from there being like a soup of about 20 to 30 games, which I thought were all pretty good and I kind of liked a lot of most of them.
Yeah, I think that the key thing that happened in terms of the back half of the year that you're saying is Assassin's Creed was delayed and I think that November was basically left to Assassin's Creed for a long time and then obviously unexpectedly they vacated that slot and then you basically had no big releases between Call of Duty at the end of October and Indiana Jones at the beginning of December. So there was actually like quite a big gap there where there was nothing huge, which is pretty unprecedented to have a November with no major releases in it, right? I'm probably missing one or two, but it doesn't feel like anything major happened then.
I'll tell you what should have happened. What they should have done is release Star Wars Outlaws in November instead, when they've had a bit of time to patch it up and then that could have got the response it actually deserved in that November window and we could have just played Assassin's Creed later anyway. I feel like that would have been the move in retrospect, but I don't know, hindsight and all that in it.
Also, I would say it's also been quite a weird year for Nintendo in that on one hand, I think a lot of people are right to say, this is pretty good for this late in the Switch life, like the number of games they made, but I can't say many of them got me hugely excited.
Yeah. Well, that's one of my questions I was going to ask you Matthew, was this a year that every console manufacturer brought something cool to the table? I think you could argue, I personally, my take on this is you could argue that Sony did, Microsoft did, Nintendo, it's a bit more debatable.
It's not like it doesn't seem like there's one clear cut, very exciting thing to me. Nintendo had Echoes of Wisdom and a Paper Mario remaster, but it definitely feels like the end of a generation to me.
Yeah, but like the end of a generation we probably would have killed for on previous Nintendo generations. If the last year of Wii or Gamecube had been as strong as this, I would have been laughing on my respective magazines. But yeah, if it was a little bit looking a gift horse in the mouth to say no thank you to Super Princess Peach, but there is a little bit of that going on.
I just found their messaging this year a little odd. The things you heard most about from them, or that seemed to break through, were the bits of Nintendo I don't really care about. Their museum and their theme parks and their alarm clock.
They are becoming this bigger cultural force. I don't know if they're feeling sort of empowered off the back of Super Mario Brothers movie being so big and, you know, breaking comfortably into mainstream film culture. But I feel like there's been a lot of that kind of stuff.
I could not give a fuck that they're building a Donkey Kong theme park. That really depresses me. If I could press a button and all those theme parks would disappear and in their place would be one nine out of ten from Nintendo, I would press it instantly.
Like, boop. And, you know, I don't know what that game would be. Xenoblade 4, boop.
No theme parks, but Xenoblade 4, absolutely, you know. I'd probably press the button for like a really good Kid Icarus remaster or remake. Uprising, no theme park, but I do get to play Uprising on my Switch.
I would make that swap.
You'll get that free next year anyway. You don't have to delete a theme park in order to get that if that's any comfort, Matthew. I think that will come at some point after the Xenoblade Chronicles X remaster, which seemed very unlikely once upon a time as well.
Yeah, I will say up front, I will give people like 10 minutes to evacuate the theme park before I press the button. Like, we'll announce it over the tannoy. We'll probably have to get an actor as Toad to announce it, so not to break the magic fiction of Nintendo Land.
But Toad will say, you have 10 minutes to get the fuck out of Nintendo Land.
What are you saying in his little voice? Like, Wow, you have 10 minutes to get the fuck out! Kind of thing.
You gotta get out in 10 minutes!
That's a good impression.
It's a smart Simpson, isn't it?
I guess it is. That's about his practice, his Toad impression, though, if you don't mind me saying so. I feel like that's...
Oh no! The park's gonna close!
It's getting slightly more deranged the longer it goes on. But 10 minutes notice is very generous of you. I suppose the key question to ask him, Matthew, is because, you know, you are...
I don't call you a Nintendo fanboy, but you have Nintendo leaning, certainly. Everyone knows that. Yeah, obviously.
But have any Nintendo games made your top 10 this year?
They haven't.
Well, that's quite a big deal.
Yeah, this is my first non-Nintendo year. There's things which are on Nintendo, but nothing Nintendo published, which on one hand speaks to, like I say, this soup of quality, you know, that there were lots of things which were like equally good. And yeah, I just had to do a lot of heart picks.
If anything was going to make it on there, it would have been Echoes of Wisdom. I just I haven't finished it yet. I'm only I'm still only about like two thirds of the way through it.
And I am really enjoying it, but I just can't quite. I don't know if it's just the 2D Zelda lineage isn't like quite my thing. But yeah, it didn't make the cut.
I just don't think it's a good enough game, frankly. I just think it's too it just the inventory stuff's too messy. It's not elegant enough.
It's experimental and interesting. But I think it's just not quite in that 910 range. It's just not.
No, I think it's I think it's an A. You know, I definitely think it sits there. And I just it's just a weird game, which is like I'm full of experimentation, but then I end up doing like the five OP moves over and over again.
It feels like once you've worked out certain tricks, quite a lot of that game's design sort of breaks. And, you know, basically, once you know how to walk up a wall, which it came relatively early in my playthrough. Yeah, I just all of a sudden, like, you know, the potential of all these weird creatures and furniture and pots and whatever, like I just stopped doing that and just used this same spider over and over again.
It's just like a game about Zelda and the spider going around Hyrule, which is fine. It's a bit weird.
But, you know, it's interesting, at least, because last year we both had, you know, Nintendo games on our list. I think you had three games on your list. I believe you had the Xenoblade Chronicles DLC they did, the expansion.
We both had Pikmin 4 and you had Cheers of the Kingdom, but I didn't. But I had Mario Wonder on my list, which you didn't have. So that's interesting.
That's quite a big shift. It does, you know, compared to a year like that, it does feel like a lesser year. But I think that actually this makes it a good time for Nintendo to double down on that culture stuff.
It obviously means something to them. But the rumour is going around that we are essentially weeks away from a Switch successor reveal. So we're about to get a bevy of Nintendo related stuff going on.
So like on the game side. So I think it's OK for them to have one quieter year, you know?
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'm not holding it against them. And like you said, what they've made has been perfectly fine.
I've enjoyed lots of it. I just didn't make the list.
OK, well, what types of game popped off for you this year, Matthew, and was it a weaker year for any particular area of games?
I'm weaker here for the Nintendo area of games, as we just stepped into this issue like theme parks, clocks and museums, which I don't. Though I actually I am envious of the museum and that Catherine got to go. I'm envious of Catherine that she got to go to the museum.
I'm not envious of the museum. That's weird.
You're like, I'm going to delete the museum in exchange for like a remaster of Paper Mario Color Splash. Something really deranged like that.
Yes, Paper Mario Sticker Star on 3DS, remade for Switch, Goodbye Museum. I don't know what I would expect in exchange for Alamo.
Yeah, like, what's it, like, Wii Plaza comes back in exchange for Alamo being deleted.
I don't know if it's even that. I think Alamo is more like you swap it for like, they used to have that point system with the reward points in GameCube games, and you could basically exchange them for desktop wallpapers of Donkey Kong. It's more like that.
It's like I'd swap them for like, some pretty nice center blade desktop wallpapers, probably. Yeah. But to answer the question, I think it's been a bit of an all-timey for JRPGs and non-Western games more generally, but if you are into, you know, turn-based games, the fact that you had Atlus absolutely storming it this year with, with, you know, Persona 3, Shimegami Tensei V Vengeance, Metaphor E Fantasio, you had Sega with Unicorn Overlord, Atlus only published that in Japan, Dragon Quest III, HD, I mean, like, Likers of a certain kind of RPG, I think we're very well fed, you know, Paper Mario, Infinite Wealth.
It just feels like a massive year for like 100 hour games. And I've heard people say like, you know, if you did play those games, if that is your, you know, religion or whatever, you know, it feels like you've played games from start to finish nonstop. This does feel like a 10 out of 10 year, if that is your reason to live.
It isn't quite for me, but I have had a great time with it.
Yeah, I didn't get to all of those games because each one of them was extremely demanding time wise. Yeah, and I will get to some of them at some point, but I know you certainly gave it a good attempt to play as many of those as possible, Matthew. And I do agree that there is a certain dominance they have.
At the same time, I kind of observe a little bit of a sort of apathy towards a certain type of Western AAA game that has maybe this has percolated the most with Star Wars Outlaws as we discussed last week on the podcast. Sort of like maybe people wrongly assuming that was quite a generic open world game, kind of box sticky open world game, when I think you and I both agree that was a pretty decent, slightly different version of an open world game. It didn't make my list for the simple reason I haven't finished it.
And pretty much everything on my list, I've either finished or I'm on the brink of finishing. So that's one thing. At the same time, though, it was interesting seeing things happen unexpectedly huge success from something like Space Marine 2, which is kind of like on the other end of the blockbuster spectrum.
The kind of blockbuster that people, they basically have not really made since the Xbox 360 days. The kind of like seven or eight hour campaign blockbuster with a multiplayer mode if you want to keep playing it. And that game sold, I think, five million copies now.
So it's significant to me that a Warhammer game has outsold a Star Wars game. That feels like a bit of a temperature check of the moment that maybe people are just ready for something slightly different. I think that's what I take away from that.
Do you think the long wait we've had between Gears of Wars impacts that? Do you think there's a lot of Gears players picking that up just out of hunger?
I think that's probably part of that. I reckon that's probably like their secondary audience. But I think it's also just Warhammer's time.
It's time for that. You can just see that all the cogs are turning on getting that to be the next big thing in pop culture. There's a TV show in theory that's being made.
Those miniatures have never been more popular. The games have had a really bumpy, up and down time, critically. But it feels like Space Marine 2 is exactly the kind of game that people have been waiting for.
I think it just increases the potential of success for that entire thing.
Henry Cavill's made it okay for handsome people to like it as well. A big dam has broken on that.
There's a bit of that. I've actually weirdly been playing Dawn of War 2, Retribution. The last stand multiplayer with my regular multiplayer pals, Phil and Tom.
That's basically like a kind of like a RTS version of Horde mode in Gears of War where you just have to face off loads and loads of different Warhammer 40,000 factions, like numerous dudes and waves. It's really fun. So maybe it has jammed into my brain a little bit more than it previously did.
Still no danger of me painting the miniatures though, Matthew. But I suppose we should talk a tiny bit about the industry turmoil this year, Matthew. This was in my plan last year.
I just copied it over because the same thing has happened, basically. This feels like last year again, except this time with bonus layoffs for Games Media. It's been a really rough year for that space.
Events company, Reed Exhibitions sold Eurogamer, RPS, VG247 to IGN. So a lot more Games Media is now owned by one company. That's happened this year.
At the same time, there have been layoffs in that space too. I think everyone at IGN was offered redundancy if they wanted to take it, and some people have. There's sites that have shut down as well.
In general, it's just been quite brutal. I don't think we need to dwell on it that much. It's talked about all the time.
If you're on LinkedIn, it's pretty horrible. You're exposed to it constantly. I think there's a lot of people who have the anxiety of clinging on in games and hoping that it works out alright in the long run.
Any observations on this, Matthew? Or should we just move on because it's bleak?
I would say that, while I've had lots of fun with the games I have played, I do think the character of the year is incredibly sour, and it hasn't been a particularly fun time to be involved or interested in anything like Games Adjacent. I've done less reading this year around games. Part of the problem, I've read less stuff.
I just don't want to be involved in the culture wars at all. There's that going on on top. There's the fucking sanity of AI eating through the traditional human field of journalism.
And shamefully, my solution has been quite head in the sand. I feel like Blue Sky coming along as a bit of an alternative to things. Certainly, for the time being, seems like a nicer place has definitely...
I'm not going to say it's like improve my mental health, but being on there and being, just removing myself from those conversations because I feel like they're conversations you can't have any impact on. So that has been disappointing. Like it's almost, it's like an undercurrent of like, it's like sort of secret shame that you're kind of enjoying all this stuff, but you're at the same time, you're like, well, that's because I've shut off from all this other stuff and I'm not wading into all this other stuff.
But I know I just feel some people have got the character for that and some people don't.
Yeah.
So yeah, it has been, it's been depressing.
It is. There's a reason we don't really do industry commentary on here. It's just so, it's so bleak.
I see people who have been out of work for like a year plus on LinkedIn and it's really rough out there. I don't really have any like reassuring observations or anything like that. I'm in the same boat of like, I'll just like cling on in there and hope that the rough times pass, and I'll still be there at the end of it.
That basically is it. I think everyone in games is in the same boat. Just hang on and hopefully it will be slightly better at some point.
Meanwhile, like you say, the games has continued to be great and there's loads on the horizon for next year and it's strange. It's a strange time, but that is as much mental headspace as I can afford the situation Matthew, because we've got a podcast to do. So, yeah, I will ask you.
It's more important that we do Games Court than address any of that.
We're doing Games Court precisely to distract from that. You know, even in war time, they had like fucking, I don't know, USA or whatever, didn't they?
So, you know, we are entertaining the troops, entertaining the troops in the culture war.
We're Bob Hope in Vietnam. That's us, Matthew.
Two giant Bob Hopes.
And then it all goes wrong, like an apocalypse now, and they have to get us and the bikini women out of there in the helicopter, with all these terrifying, horny GIs coming over the fence.
This metaphor is one of the more cursed to have come up on this podcast.
Definitely. Let's take a right turn then. We do always talk a little bit about what's happening with us in a vague way on this podcast, because, you know, people listen to podcasts partly because they, you know, mostly because they enjoy our game takes, Matthew, but only some of the people we listen to are invested in us as people.
How has your year been, personally?
Yeah, it's all right. Yeah, I think if you've got, you know, stocks in Matthew Castle, which I hope you don't, it's been a pretty stable year. Obviously, I moved off PlayStation Access in the last couple of months, and I'm doing something which is, like, I don't want to say gentler, just in case my bosses listen to this and think I'm having an easy ride, but less people management, which is never my strong suit, you know, like I'm better off, just, you know, let me make my content.
I'm a content guy, and that's fine, and I get to watch some TV and that's fun. Yeah, it's been okay, like, quite a sort of static year. I've just worked and consumed huge amounts of pop culture, films, TV and games and books.
I don't know what happened this year. I've always been greedy with this stuff, but this year particularly, I feel like I just watched so much TV, but I also played so many games, maybe saw slightly fewer films, and I've exhausted Japanese crime fiction now, unfortunately, so there's not as much going on there. But yeah, on some deep subconscious level, maybe there's a little bit of distraction from wider world, and if things do sometimes feel a bit static in your life, you can distract yourself with video games.
They are, but they're a pleasant distraction. I can't say I haven't enjoyed myself. Yeah, I think it's okay.
I'm always bewildered by just how much you get through. Your discipline to just sit there and chew through this stuff is crazy to me. I can't quite do the same thing, but this is probably my most prolific year for media consumption as well, despite the fact I've been in London two days a week most of the year.
But somehow I've managed to get through. Yeah, I think I've got a firm for our XXL pod this month on Patreon. I've got a firm 10 shows to discuss.
I watched all four seasons of Atlanta this year. I've found plenty of time for the stuff. But Matthew is particularly good at just getting through massive games.
Every massive game you finished this year, which I find kind of crazy, or at least most of them you did. Most of the major ones.
I cram games in at all kinds of weird time though. I'll sometimes play lunchtime at work because I can, because there are games consoles at work. I can play games as part of my day job a little bit when I was on Access.
I was often a bit too busy for that. I sometimes play games early in the morning. I'll get up and play an hour before work or something.
I like to cram the day with stuff. I don't want to just be sitting there. Weekends, we don't do much.
We don't have kids, that helps. We're quite settled in our home life, that helps. Catherine has to play games for her job, obviously on Eurogamer.
So, you know, when she's doing that, what am I going to do? Well, I'm going to play games myself. So, you know, I feel like you've got a busier life.
You've got more going on.
Oh, just a tiny bit more, I think. But I know most of the people I know are in London. You're the only like...
But you meet people for coffee. And I never do. I'm incredibly antisocial.
I haven't seen Rich Stanton once this year. And we live like a five minute car ride apart. Like, that's crazy.
That is weird.
I'm not going to say that's on more on one of us than the other, but I'm just putting out.
That's fine. He'll listen to this in two years anyway when he catches up. So it's no danger of him hearing it, Matthew.
Yeah, so, yeah, it's just, yeah, it's been one of those years. I watched so much Cheers and Frasier. Why did I do that?
That was mad.
Well, maybe we should do a writing project or something next year collaboratively to stop you from doing as much of that. Because I personally think you need a bit of time in between all the media consumption in order to pass it and think about it. Like I felt a bit of relief today when I finally finished FF7 Rebirth.
I could take my foot off the gas and just please sit there and be like, oh, well, what do I think about all of that?
Just sit there and contemplate Yuffie.
No more Yuffie chatter before we both get cancelled.
Okay. Contemplate Kate Sith.
How bad that puzzle section was in that fucking mansion. Okay. Before we get to our top 10 list, Matthew, is there anything you wish that you got to this year that you didn't have time for?
I was going to ask you what your year was like.
It was all right. Let's think. I had one personal catastrophe.
But that aside, I feel like I've had, every year since I've been doing the podcast, I feel like my career has been going very well, and then my personal life has been a bit more up and down. But I think whenever I speak to my mum about this, she's like, these things never really happened at the same time. You'll have years where your personal life is really a lot going on, and then there's years where your professional life will be a lot going on.
I'd say this year has been a bit more of a mix of both, I guess. But the last three, I started in PR in 2021, I did a couple of years at Frontier, I moved over to... And then at the end of last year, I could either have stayed and fought for my job against another PR manager there, or I could take voluntary redundancy.
But because they asked before our game launched, I took voluntary redundancy, not quite knowing what I was going to do, but being absolutely knackered from launching a game and hoping it would work out. And then I've this year been doing a year of maternity cover, at Bethesda, so I got to work on the entire Indiana Jones and the Great Circle campaign, Doom, The Dark Age just being announced, loads of Fallout 76 stuff happening, and obviously there's a Fallout TV show this year, so that really supercharged interest in that.
I got to go to a press event that you ran, that was interesting.
Oh yeah, the Fallout one in May.
Yeah, that was a great event. I ate loads of food. They had some sort of fallouts, they had like whatever it is, Blammo, Blamco, Mac and cheese style thing.
You know the way to my heart. Lots of Mac and cheese. All right, anything about a game if you give me enough Mac and cheese.
Yeah, there's a picture of you and me in our office actually that was taken this year. A picture of you and me and Jeremy as well actually, in nearby Regent's Park. So yeah, it's interesting actually because Indiana Jones I expect is going to be on Matthew's list.
I've not played it for this episode because it wouldn't be appropriate for me to put it in my top 10 obviously. But I will tell one story about Indiana Jones. So at the end of last year, I had my first call about Bethesda while I was in Japan.
I was at my mate Lynch's house and I had a call with my boss at the moment.
So it's convenience store chicken in one hand, phone in the other hand.
Yeah, very vivid picture. Yeah, and so I could talk about what was going to work on, and there'll be some Elder Scrolls Online stuff, and then he went, Indiana Jones. When he said Indiana Jones, I was like, I just felt my pulse race a little bit.
There was this thing of when that phone call was happening, I basically, what I did at that moment was make a major life decision because of Indiana Jones. That's what I did. I heard those words.
Think of all the women who've done that.
Yeah, I felt like Marion at that moment. I was just like, I've got to work on that, man. It's been really fun to work on.
Those machine games guys are just so talented, just so brilliant. They're just so smart and they've worked together for years, and people love the game, which has been really cool. Got to do some cool stuff with Troy Baker and Marios, who plays Vos, the villain of the game.
It was a really rewarding year of getting PR stuff done, making opportunities for people, did that Red Edge cover, for example. So professionally, it's been really good. I sort of saw it as a chance to supercharge my CV and all that kind of business.
So it's been really good. I feel really fortunate. And now that the year is done, I'm a little bit like, oh, I guess I should just go pay attention to the other bits of my life.
It's about time to get off LinkedIn and go to Facebook. I don't know what controls the other parts of your life.
No, it's fine. I'll go on a second date tomorrow. That's like real life, isn't it?
That's an actual person who exists, so that's good. That sounded a bit too defensive, me saying that, didn't it? As if she might actually not be real based on that.
So yeah, it's all right. It sort of trundles along. Yeah.
Nacker in talking about myself, genuinely. Absolutely drains me, it does. So before we get to our top 10 list, Matthew, is there anything you wish we got to that we didn't have time for?
Not really. I didn't play enough of Dragon Age, The Veil Guard to make a call either way. I basically paused that and thought, I'm not going to rush through this.
I'm going to take my time. It seemed solid and well-made. I like the combat, I like seeing the characters who are back and the continuation of the story from Inquisition, which is very much like my Dragon Age, the one I've had the most experience with.
But I hear all the good stuff is halfway in and at the end, and I haven't seen any of that. Yeah, I mean, there's some other things that haven't made my list, but I don't want to necessarily spoil some of the list chats, so maybe we can get into some specific things if they do come up. But there's a few things that I really liked and I recognise as exceptional.
I just didn't necessarily have the time to dig into them as thoroughly as I wanted, and so I just haven't included them rather than kind of half-ass it and guess at their place. You know, I guess an example of this would be like Sheeran the Wanderer, which I did start playing and have been enjoying, but I am just so shit at it and I've made so little progress through it. You know, it's a proper old school road like in terms of complete progress resets and trying to work out all its strange arcane behaviours on every run.
And it's thrilling and it's been championed by good people, as we said on last week's pod. But yeah, like things like that, like there's lots of good stuff you won't hear on my list, but it didn't mean I wasn't aware or didn't engage with it. You know, there's often a reason why it's on the list.
Yeah, I have quite a few things from this year. They're mostly the monster size games, to be honest. So I didn't play any of those Atlas RPGs this year.
The most I played was Persona 3 Reload, which I mentioned last week. I did really like that, but I probably wouldn't have made my list anyway, because I've already got, well, there's already some other stuff that's in the vein of a remake in that list. So I try not to let too much of it get into there.
I'm behind on Yakuza. I've not played Infinite Wealth, and I know that's a significant game for a lot of people, even if being released in January means it's a little bit forgotten by some people. Just because a lot has happened since then.
Tactical Breach Wizards. Wish I'd played that. I bought that.
Didn't get around to it. Might play at some point. Arco.
Didn't play that. Heard it was good. But there was a few...
I would say Indies is probably where I've let people down the most of my list. I would say I've not engaged with Indies as fully as I normally do. So I don't really have a pizza tower this year.
I've got a My House.
I've got a literal pizza tower, but I haven't got a pizza tower, if you know what I mean.
I do, I do. Very good, Matthew. I've got an equivalent of My House.Ward from last year.
I've got something in that vein. But yeah, didn't play Loreley in the laser eyes, although it sounds like it would have just driven me nuts anyway. Yeah, I don't know.
I feel like I got my arms around the year reasonably well. And the Japanese RPGs are the exception, really. Still not...
obviously never finished Elden Ring, so not played that DLC, which I'm sure that would be storming the game of the year list. But people who have listened to the podcast this long, they know our deal. Elden Ring is not really our sort of thing.
I don't know if it would have. I don't feel like there was the same level of buzz around it. I feel like there's a cooling on...
not on Elden Ring. Obviously, it sold 30 million copies or whatever. But like that, I just didn't hear anyone talking about it.
Maybe I've just managed to manufacture such a tight social circle that won't let that get to me. I don't know, but Elden Ring did. And even we got swept up a little bit in the Elden Ring thing.
But yeah, this one was...
I still think of Elden Ring as a very cool open world game. That's how I... It's like a true world of discovery in the way that Breath of the World is.
It's just that all the things you discover absolutely kick your ass. That's the entire premise of the game, really. A few other things from this year I didn't get to play.
Frostpunk 2, got that, didn't play it. The Thorma Turge, that RPG that came out.
Catherine said that was decent.
Yeah, Jeremy really liked that as well. I think I would like that if I played it. It's just, again, time was a factor.
Didn't quite get around to play any more of Batman Arkham Shadow. That might have had some potential to be on the Game of the Year list for a bit more time.
I was wondering if that might make the cut.
Yeah, but the rest I will not discuss in case I come up in your list, Matthew. But that's plenty. There's always things you can't tick off.
I managed to get through two monster size games this year, but I couldn't find time for any more. That's just adult living, unless you're Matthew Castle, in which case you finish all of them, and that's just what he does.
That's because I'm not an adult. I'm a 15-year-old boy at heart.
So last thing then, Matthew, before we take a quick break. Can you remember which games you called the best of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 on this podcast, aka all the different years that we've done Game of the Year list on this pod?
Yeah, I think I can, disappointingly for you.
Yeah, I can't remember all mine.
I think 2020 was Desperado's Three.
Yeah.
I think 2021 was Metroid Dread.
Yeah, correct.
Two for two. 2022 is the one, I'm pretty sure it would be Xenoblade Three, but I also really rated Signalis. I can't remember if I just tried to sort of ruffle from Feathers by putting Signalis at number one.
No, it did go that high, but the fansite is fucking taking an age to allow it.
Oh, fansite.
Fucking hell, Graham. Come on, mate. I saw it out.
No, you put Xenoblade Chronicles Three as number one for that one. Signalis is number two, though.
For that asset, the greatest wiki of all time.
Vampire Survivors number three. Did you like that game that much?
I played it loads.
Yeah. I had the DLC they did for that with Castlevania. It was really good.
I mean, it's just one of those things that I'm not sure I can allow more time for in my life, but I was very impressed by it at the time.
Yeah, I have properly weaned myself off that. I know it's had about five million updates since then, and it's probably full of all this rad shit that I love. It's probably got Ace Attorney characters in it, for all I know.
But I haven't been playing it, so God knows. Last year's got to be Tears of the Kingdom.
Yeah, well, very good, Matthew. You remembered pretty well there.
I should have researched this for you, but I didn't do it, because as well-established, I'm the lazier of us.
That's fine. So I could remember 2022. That was Tunic.
I couldn't remember 2021. That turned out to be Hitman 3, though, which is a good call.
Yeah, that's great.
That's a decent shout. It stood the test of time, that one. I don't quite remember last year off the top of my head.
I feel like it should, but...
Well, it definitely wasn't Tears of the Kingdom.
No, it 100% wasn't. But it was... I feel like it was something blockbuster-y.
Oh, Graham's Sites Loaded. It's Jedi Survivor. Of course it was.
Of course, Jedi Survivor.
Of course. And I put Resi 4 at number 2. You put Shadow Gambit at number 2.
And you put Baldur's Gate 3 at number 3. And I put Pizza Town at number 3. God, we've got good gaming taste, don't we?
Just constantly impressed by ourselves. I think I put Destiny at number 1 in 2020 because I hadn't played many games that year, but I'd played fucktons of Destiny. It was like my sort of main non-apex pandemic game.
So that was one thing. Ironic, because I feel like you're always talking about how your memory doesn't work that well. But I don't know.
It seems like you've got a good grasp on this. I did ask you this exact question last year, so the information might be-
Oh, maybe that's what it is. Just by repeating them, it's drilling them in. That's how I learn.
Fair enough, yes. So here we are again, ready to talk about this year's best games. Our two top 10 lists and whatever we talk about will end up being, no doubt, like a pillar of our personalities for the next 12 months of this podcast, Matthew.
So shall we take a quick break and come back with the top 10s?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, two top 10 lists, counting down from 10 to one, and whoever's got the game the highest in their list, if it comes up twice, fuck, I always explain this so badly.
That was going great, that was going so well.
Okay, so if two people pick the same game, then we'll talk about it whenever we get to its highest placement on either list, basically. So that's it.
Great, you did brilliantly.
Thanks, pal, I appreciate that. I needed a self-esteem boost, so I appreciate that. Okay, so before we get started, Matthew, we wish to give one game a mild kicking here.
I think Avengers got it one year, and I think that alien shooter game that came out, Elite Squad or something, I gave that a kicking one year. We always mentioned one thing that we just didn't quite get along with. So what's your disappointing game of the year?
Do I use this slot to once again bore everyone rigid about Metaphor Re-Fantasia? Not quite being my cup of tea. That probably is the game that disappointed me most this year.
Disappointed me to the tune of an 8 out of 10. God, I'm a broken record. I have no original take.
Well, my original take on Metaphor Re-Fantasia is that it's merely fine. Has some decent characters, nice character set up, but repeats a lot of systems which I don't think make as much sense in that world. I think it's quite a bland fantasy world.
I got quite frustrated with people telling me how sophisticated its story telling was, but I actually found it quite trite. So yeah, that's definitely been the game of 2024, which I think I've most diverged from popular consensus on. And yeah, I just don't quite see it, I'm afraid.
Well, the winners in that situation were the listeners of this podcast. They got a great heel turn from you on that game.
Yeah, I mean, not really, because I think people just wanted to be told that it was great, because most people liked it and did like it when they then went on to play it, and just wanted to be reassured that it was good. No one wants to hear that their favorite game of the year. That was the thing that really surprised me when people were like, well, this is game of the year.
You know, this is a 10 out of 10 game. I'm like, even putting aside my specific leaning towards the Persona series and how this game doesn't apply those systems as neatly as Persona, even if you put that, which is my big criticism aside, I still think this is quite a plodding game. The section I'm in now is like grind hell towards the end of the game.
Just basically gives you a big chunk of time to get your party ready for the end. And it's just a completely shapeless stretch of game. Really odd.
I mean, it's one of those. I'm not a big fan of the... I don't see how...
I'm saying this. This is something you said recently. I'm not saying I'm not a big fan of the...
I don't see how a game with this got a 10. Which I know is like your battle cry against Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
Don't spoil my big takes on the episode.
But there are elements of this where I'm like, it seems so thin. I'm amazed people were as into this. But it is still absolutely fine.
I probably preferred it to Dragon Quest III, which I must admit I don't quite see eye to eye with either. I don't know if there's just like a mad nostalgia play going on for people who played this one first when it was on the NES in America or whatever. But that is like an incredibly bare-bones, stripped-back old ass JRPG.
And I don't know if it's magic particularly works for me. I think it's fine and it's handsomely made, but it's giving something a 10 because it's important seems a bit weird to me.
Okay. Well, that's interesting. I mean, I sort of, I didn't play any bad games this year, as established on last week's episode.
I didn't play anything that I found like- Lucky you. Unlike Matthew, I didn't have any professional reason to play loads and loads of games in a row.
So I didn't quite get on with that Alone in the Dark redo this year. I thought it was all right, but it felt a little bit like it maybe could have used a bit. I don't know.
It feels very PS3, but in a way that doesn't get the blood pumping.
Right.
But I feel bad because that studio got closed down, which is a shame because it felt like a reasonably solid first attempt to do something in that space, but they won't get another attempt where they probably spent loads and loads of money getting David Harper and Jodie Comer for that game, and it feels like it probably didn't do much to move the needle. So, shame. But that's tough because they're going into a space that's got Resi remakes in it.
It's a really hard area to break into. The market leaders are just so far out in front. So, I don't want to be too mean towards that game, but I played about a couple of hours of that, and that didn't quite work for me, unfortunately.
That's much less controversial than Refantazio is a no-from-me doll.
Then Echoes of Wisdom probably is the other one, that I played half of a 2D Zelda, then ditched it halfway through and feel no regrets about that decision at all. That's a disappointment because I was very up for it. I love the way these games look, but I've established many times now how I feel about the inventory system in this game, so I won't keep banging on about it.
That's it though, Matthew. Otherwise, I thought this is a really good year. I had about five games that were almost in this list and have various times been in the list and have dropped out, moved around, that kind of stuff.
But yeah, I think I'm comfortable with my end placement now, and it is what it is. Maybe some of those honorable mentions will come up at the end. Let's see what's in the main top 10s first.
So Matthew, let's kick off with your number 10. What have you got?
My number 10 is Drumroll. I've just fucked up my document. So here's a super obscure one.
Its name has not been uttered on this podcast this year.
Oh shit. Did a new version of Minesweeper come out?
Well, no. So I basically put a shout out at the end of the year for like under the radar recommendations. And this one came in.
I played it. I absolutely loved it. It's Mini Shoot Adventures, which is a genre mashup that I've not really seen before.
Kind of a top down 2D adventure in the Zelda mold. You've got an overworld with dungeons that you're, you know, exploring, but you are a little spaceship and it controls a twin stick shooter. So it's, yeah, sort of Zelda through the lens of a twin stick shooter.
So, you know, there's lots of arena fights where you're locked in with enemies firing almost sort of bullet hell-ish bullet formations at you that you're then weaving through while you're obviously peppering them with fire. A couple of things I really liked about this. One was just, it's a new idea.
Always exciting to see. Handles really nicely. You know, the nuts and bolts of the thing.
Very nice feeling, great sound effects. The pickups, incredibly satisfying. Pinging noises when you grab them.
It has a little XP system where every enemy you kill drops like a little rock that goes into this sort of almost like a barrel. And it looks like the little chips that fall in there are physics objects. So the way it piles up is really like organic and mesmerizing.
That's something I really like about this game. Speaking to its sort of XP and upgrade systems, I think it has two really nice progression systems going on. It has that Metroid-y unlocking of powers that lets the map gradually unfold as you get sort of jumping powers and dodging powers.
You'd just be able to cover geography you couldn't cover before. But at the same time, because you're killing enemies and collecting these little rocks, when you fill up that gauge, you get to buy a new power. So no matter how you're doing in the kind of the fixed structure of the game, your little ship is naturally getting, you know, better firepower, faster bullets, quicker movement or whatever.
So if it ever does get difficult, you can kind of just grind your way just by playing the game. Like you never drop that currency on death. So you're just constantly chipping away towards improving, which, you know, there must have been systems like this in other games.
But as a kind of upgrade path that runs side by side with the kind of the story upgrade path, I really like that. I thought that was neat. Like I've not seen that before.
Solved a lot of problems with any difficulty spikes. And I think really the main thing is that, you know, I really like the idea of bullet hell shooters and shoot em ups. But I'm not very good at them, and I don't necessarily have the patience for them.
And I think this game, Mini Shoot Adventures, you know, it's sort of plenty difficult enough so that you can enjoy that thrill of like weaving through the projectiles. I think it gives you enough of a taste of like what makes those games, those games. But it's not so hard that you're just like constantly hitting a brick wall.
And if you do, you know, like I say, your ship is naturally getting better with every death. And that fixes that. And instead of it being a game about just high score chasing or incredibly highly skilled play, which, you know, shoot em ups tend to be, this is, you know, it has that forward momentum of like, well, you've just done a temple, you're trying to get to this next temple.
There are, you know, hidden dungeons, there are hidden challenge rooms, you know, it kind of pulls you through, not just, you know, through the promise of mastery, but with more traditional, you know, video game structure, I guess. And I just thought it was super compelling, like that blend of those two things. So, you know, a couple of people shouted this out to me and hugely appreciative of it, played it on my Steam Deck, like absolutely loved it, like tremendous 10 or so hours playing this.
Nice. Yeah, I have become aware of this because I think I had stalked the mentions of your Blue Sky poster, just to see what kind of like threads he'd be pulling on for the Game of the Year. Right.
I do really love the way this looks. Yeah, an interesting little meld of things there, I can see why it appealed to you, Matthew. Why does it have an apostrophe after mini-shoots?
What's all that about?
Mini, I guess you are mini-shoots? Yeah. It has no dialogue in it.
It's completely story-free. That's another big tick. It's just straight into it.
Yeah, I guess you're mini-shoots. Mini-shoots adventures. I'm not entirely sure.
I'm not a huge fan of the name. I must admit, I've seen this on Steam and things like that, and I just assumed it was crap because of the name, and maybe because of the thumb art. It didn't really have the sort of veneer of being like a legit thing, and actually it is hugely legit.
But I don't really know how else they could dress it up to make it, you know, it is what it is. It's a little cartoon-y world and, you know, I don't know. Could a different name have got me on board with this earlier?
But if you look at the, you look at a few screenshots of this though, and it will instantly go on your wishlist. That's what I'll say about this game. It absolutely jumps off at what they're going for visually in it.
Like you say, it looks very legitimate. So yeah, that's an interesting pick, Matthew. And, you know, I know you like to surprise every year with a thing I'm not expecting.
Well, I've got a couple like that. And I guess, like, I didn't want to put it in as a stick to beat Echoes of Wisdom, but, like, this was my favorite Zelda-like of the year. So that's why this is in.
Take that, Grezzo.
That isn't her.
Orbital Strike on Grezzo from Matthew Castle there.
No, it's not. It's more like I'm steering my little ship in circles around Grezzo, peppering them with largely harmless laser fire. But if I do it for long enough, I'll get their health bar down.
Okay, good stuff, Matthew. Yeah, Steam Deck was my destination for a lot of indie games this year. It feels like there's an increasing amount that are coming out on Steam now before Switch, or not coming to Switch at all, which is a bit, I feel like a marked difference.
Well, that's because their store is like the fucking Wild West. Did you see that thing this week where there's a fake version of unpacking selling, fake unpacking DLC packs and Nintendo won't remove it or even like address the developers? That's fucking mad.
It is. I'm sure that if I released a game with Luigi on it on the Nintendo store, it would take them just as long to address the situation, Matthew.
Well, let's wait for Power Games to turn up.
So yes, good pick, Matthew. Like I say, straight on my Steam wishlist. So I'll check that out at some point.
My number 10 then is a game called Mouthwashing, first person horror game by a developer called Wrong Organ. I'm not particularly familiar with their work, but this is, I would say, a horror game in the kind of slightly PS1 aesthetic. It is a game about your captain of this ship crashed the ship.
At the very start of the game, you play this sequence where you crash the ship, and then he is alive but maimed, and then the ship is basically is damaged, and the crew on it are potentially going to die because you can't reach your destination after the crash basically. What then plays out is this nonlinear narrative. It goes back and forth before the crash and after the crash to help you make sense of what happened, and then you play through these different sequences on the ship in first person, talk to the members of the crew, that kind of stuff, and unpick what was actually going on.
It's not like there's multiple ways to play this. There is one narrative that's playing out. I guess you might say it's a walking simulator in some ways, but it is very, very gnarly, very scary in places.
And I would say that I like to aspire to have a kind of like Kim Newman's video dungeon element to this Game of the Year list sometimes. Just give you one little video nasty to check out. And mouthwashing is one of those, I can't claim any credit for discovering, this has become a bit of a YouTube sensation.
I get the bleak sense that maybe more people are watching it on YouTube than actually playing it, which if so, that sucks, but it's about 10 quid. It is properly unsettling. It has a lot going on story-wise, and some things implied, some things outright stated.
And it's about three hours long. And I would say that it's an extremely rewarding play, Matthew.
So a couple of things about this. Yeah. One, why is it called Mouthwashing?
Or is that a really disgusting spoiler?
There is a specific reason, but the reveal of why that's the title is best saved for people who play it, I would say.
Okay.
It's kind of like a bit of a punchline, I would say.
Oh, interesting. Yeah. And would you say, is it puppet combo you like?
Yeah. It's a little bit adjacent to that, I would say. Certainly visually, it's tapping into a similar thing.
But I would say it's got a little bit more going on narratively than that does. I think puppet combo is more about vibes. This is much more about dialogue and characterization.
The magic trick of this game, I think, is that it is largely set all in the same space. It's like this lounge, a utility room, like a storage room, a cockpit. It's like the same kind of alien style freighter corridors over and over again, but they find different ways to, as you hop back and forth in time, to show the passage of time, to show the ways it changes and the way that the people aboard change.
It's really like smartly done.
Yeah, it sounds like a gnarly Tacoma.
This takes chances. If you're a horror fan, I think you'll like what this does. It's just provocative and it's sincerely nasty, but also just sincerely, but also very rich and layered as a narrative experience.
I can see why there's a, even though I think it's better to interpret it yourself than have a YouTuber explain it to you, I can see why there's a little bit of a cottage industry that's popping up out of this. I saw an explainer video that had done a million views. Clearly, this is having some impact.
I can see it being a bit of an IGF favorite.
Right. I saw some screenshots of it and something about its name as well just suggests that it's going to be a particular kind of game. I wondered if it might be, what was that really aggressively in your face, super weird immersive sim a couple of years ago?
It had an interface that looked like it was made out of dog food. It was like a nightmare. I really didn't get on with it.
I was just too square for it.
I don't know what this game is.
Cruelty Squad?
Oh, yeah, of course, Cruelty Squad.
I wondered if this was part of weird deliberately abrasive, weird steam, or if it was a bit more accessible for a normie like me. That's what I'm asking. Will a normie like me enjoy this?
Enjoy is a weird word. It's a bit like-
Well, will I appreciate it?
Yeah, I think so. It's adjacent to something like Alien Isolation. It's not the same thing.
It's an indie narrative game and uses a lot of first-person tricks, but the fundamentals of first-person horror, that's something you will know from playing Alien Isolation or Amnesia or Resi 7. It's part of that same evolutionary change, just quite far removed from it. It's easy to pass as well.
It is not deliberately obtuse in terms of how it presents a story. The time-hopping thing is very easy to keep track of, I think. I think the story is so well explained.
Yes, it's a very well-rounded experience. I think you would find it interesting, but it's heavy stuff.
Okay. Well, I can deal with heavy. I just don't want upsetting performance art.
That's not really my deal.
Well, no. I think in some ways the name mouthwashing and the art of a disfigured man wrapped in bandages with like an eyeball poking out kind of sets... In some ways, it does set an expectation of tone, but that's not the entire tone of the game.
That's like it's one part of the game's tone. And the ways in which the story is not exactly what it seems is kind of the magic of this game. I think you would appreciate it on a narrative level for sure.
So I will definitely give this a go. Catherine has also been on at me about playing this.
Yeah, super good. Definitely don't regret to put the time into this one. So that's my number 10.
What's your number nine, Matthew?
My number nine is No Case Should Remain Unsolved.
Nice, I've bought this but not played it yet.
Yeah, I imagine lots of people did. It was about like five pounds and it's like overwhelmingly positive on Steam. Came out right at the start of the year.
This is a sort of a narrative puzzle set in South Korea. You are a retired police inspector called Yeon Gyeong and you are being asked by a younger cop to re-examine a case you were involved in early in your career involving a missing child. It's a little bit Sam Barlow adjacent in that it's about passing a lot of information, a lot of testimony, but your role is to read chunks of testimony and then assign them to the right person, so you've got like a almost like a series of columns and at the top is different people's names, so you're assigning the testimony to the column and then if you think you've got the right person, you're then trying to move the testimony up and down to establish like its place in the chronology of what they said to you.
So if you know in theory if you put everything in its right place by the end of it you'll have these testimonies as they unfolded and you'll have the full kind of picture of the thing. The Sanbarlo-ishness of it all is that you are constructing a narrative from tiny fragments and trying to make sense of it. I'd say it does have a very clear fixed answer that you're working towards, which is probably why I clicked with it a little bit more than I do stuff like her story, which kind of leans a little bit more into the ambiguities and what happens if you interpret information differently.
Here, I feel like there is something that happened and you're trying to get to the heart of it, but I really love the simplicity of it. It's just a wall of text with little audio cues, the occasional image. There is something quite strange and haunting about it.
The idea that you're in this person's uncertain mind and you're dealing with information which might not be wholly true itself because that's the nature of testimony. So there's two layers of befuddlement that you're trying to work through to get to the truth. I imagine it will do different things for different people.
Some people just like the basic nuts and bolts of putting together the mystery. I definitely enjoyed that. But I think it plays brilliantly on your preconceptions and prejudices in the way that you make certain assumptions about certain characters and you assign certain testimony to them because they seem more trustworthy.
I think it leans on certain tropes and how we think about certain characters. It's quite hard to talk about without spoiling, but a character who might seem the most suspicious at the outset might end up actually being the most heroic at the end. And the way it kind of twists that, or the way one piece of testimony can completely retextualize the story and make you realize what's going on, you know, it's a little bit like, if you've ever seen the conversation with Gene Hatman and there's that sense of like he's constantly listening to the same thing and he thinks he's heard one thing and actually the reality is hidden in like a bit of intonation in what's said.
It kind of has that cleverness to it of you just assume certain things about certain people and then you realize you were just so wide at the mark and the kind of, when it all does click together, there's some really big wow moments and you know, it's all wrapped up in probably a couple of hours, two hours, three hours. I just, I thought this was like such a fantastic little narrative exercise and like really surprised me and I just thought about it for ages afterwards, about like some of the stuff I bought to it and how that kind of, you know, waylaid me on the way to the truth and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, highly recommended.
That's good. I think it's good that the one of this year's Detective Games properly worked for you. Is this the only one of its kind in your list, Matthew?
Uh, no.
Okay, interesting.
There might be another Detective Game here.
Okay, well, I know that you are... Oh, of course there is. Of course there is.
But I know you pay close attention to this genre and you know, you had your MEO, The Smiling Man, didn't quite do it for you this year.
Yeah.
Yeah, but the idea of something that's like two or three hours long is very irresistible and five pounds. That's a very strong combo. I did play this for about 10 minutes and I thought, I've got to play this when I've had a full night of sleep and I could just properly concentrate on this and not have any other distractions.
Well said, because it did seem like it depends on you to be paying attention and to remember what you've been doing for the past hour in quite minute detail. So, you know.
I think playing it in one burst is advised because otherwise you just lose the thread of it a little bit too much. And it's nice to be reminded of, you know, how wider the mark you were or like one thing you were so sure of, you're like, oh, that has to be that person. But then you realize what was actually being said.
Oh, no, it's obviously this person. It's super smart.
Nice. Well, I will definitely play this at some point, installed on my PC, not getting the most out of my 4070 Ti Super, but you know, that's okay. It's on Switch as well, isn't it Matthew, this one.
So, yes, yeah, easier to play on PC for sure.
Yeah, feels like a mouse game to me. But, you know, however you play it, go for it, I guess. All right, Matthew, well, that's your number nine.
My number nine is Helldivers 2. Is this on your list?
It isn't, but I did love it.
Yeah, I didn't think it would make your list because I know you're not really a multiplayer guy. This is a multiplayer game though, for people who don't really like multiplayer games. And I think that was the magic behind it and why it became a phenomenon.
It was not a hero shooter. It was not something, you know, very complicated. It was basically Starship Troopers-esque universe, shooting lots of aliens in a kind of EDF style way with Metal Gear Solid V style controls.
And it was very, very cold at the start of the year and we all sat indoors in February and played this game. And it was a genuine phenomenon. I played it for about 18 hours, I think, in the end.
It was enough time for me to unlock a lot of its tastiest upgrades and enjoy those and have a bunch of very in-depth session with several groups of friends and have a good time. I thought it was a very rewarding experience to play with friends and to have that level of interactivity where you land on this planet, you have several objectives to complete, but how you do it and the chaos you get up to along the way is kind of up to you. And it gamifies my favorite part of playing Halo, which is clubbing someone on the back of the head with an assault rifle.
It's basically a whole game of that. That, those interactions and how you troll your friends are arguably more interesting than the actual interactions you have with the aliens in this game. But nonetheless, it's the box of tricks they give you that make this game absolutely magic.
Just what it feels like to call in an airstrike. That's just fantastic in this game. They have been layering in different elements since then.
I might play it again at some point, but I think it is dependent on you having the right amount of friends to play it with and them being up for playing it. And that's probably dissipated a bit because that's fine. Not all multiplayer games have to exist forever with people playing them to be a success.
That's a false notion that has been pushed by the internet. But as a phenomenon to participate in this year, it was meaningful and like I say, a great multiplayer game for people who don't love multiplayer games. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I really like this for all those reasons. Just feels really nice to play, like really nice controls, like you say, that Metal Gear Solid V-ness of it. It's just so responsive, some amazing animation touches.
Yeah, I do want to jump back in, so I thought they've added the new faction in the updates and cars as well, which look like they've got like big Warthog energy. So you just know you've got to like fuck with each other in that car. That's going to be fun.
Yeah. As it's getting to the winter months as well, it might be that people have more appetite for playing it again. Yeah, I thought it was super, super good.
As I mentioned in last week's episode, just the idea of the actual hell dive in the title dropping to a planet, it's a phenomenal little interaction in a game that's full of them. I mean, there's so much funny stuff that can happen in this game, like someone getting trapped under the rescue vehicle when it arrives, when you call it air support and you leave. So, so good watching an ICBM go off in the distance.
Just a game full of great moments, great repeatable moments, a true unexpected success from this year, but a deserved one. So definitely wanted to recognize it here. What's your number eight, Matthew?
My number eight is another game which has not been mentioned, but only because it came out quite recently, but has already become a huge obsession for me. This is Xenotilt Hostile Pinball Action, which is the sequel to Demon's Tilt, which came out a couple of years ago, which you might be familiar with. Really beautiful pinball game, very twisted aesthetic, and the kind of pinball table that could only exist in a video game.
It's kind of beyond the realms of physical possibility. That first game, Demon's Tilt, was all sort of hell themed. This one is a bit more cyber-punky, sci-fi spaceship.
I think there is a narrative to it. I don't really understand what it is. The table is basically like three pinball tables welded together, a small one at the top, a medium-sized one in the middle, and then a bigger, more traditional playing field at the bottom.
The excitement every time of just managing to get the ball all the way to the top table. And you're like, right, we're going to do a little bit of damage up here. And you're kind of pinging around.
And then you fuck up. But then you're like, it doesn't matter that you fucked up because you're now into the second table and you're having a little bit of fun. You're trying to do as much there.
You're trying to activate the weird little story elements and the requirements that are attached to every sort of scoring strand of this game. But then when that goes wrong, you're down at the bottom in this bigger table and then it really counts. You don't want to go down that hole.
But I just love that constant rhythm of like, right, we're back at the top. We're going to go on this very slow journey down. If I can make this work and the longer you stay at the top, you're like, oh yeah, I'm having a great run and all the while, lasers are going off, there are explosions, weird things are bursting out of the table.
This game is like bonkers to look at, really hard to follow, not in a bad way, just in a, oh my God, the scores going up by the millions. It's all kicking off. I've played this mostly on Steam Deck, where it's just very like moreish one more go, but only by playing on PC, I'm like, oh, this is what I'm actually looking at when I'm playing this game.
Like there's all this like quite fine detail in the table, but you only get like the broad version on the tiny Steam Deck screen. If you like the sort of hypnotic loop of pinball, I just think the way this pushes it to, you know, impossible extremes, the weird aliens that come out of each part of the board and then you're fighting them off and you're trying to get deeper into the next sort of layer of scoring on each part of the table. There are gun turrets across the thing so you can collect ammo and then set these gun turrets off and they'll shoot like smaller enemies for you.
So this is like auto turrets firing. That's absolutely rad. There's a perk system where if you land in a particular place, you can change the behaviour of the table.
So you have a huge amount of control over like what you're doing in any one given run. And I haven't got massively far into it. You know, I love pinball games.
I'm slightly shit at them. I've never been very good at like tilting and nudging tables without like fucking up. I just feel like without mastering that, I'll never get too deep into it.
But when you do work out like the prerequisite for triggering a certain motion on the table, or you beat one of the boss characters, and then like the next phase of the boss character comes through, when you break new ground in Xenotilt and discover a part of the table you've never seen before, or a mad graphic or a sound effect you've never heard before, it just feels really exciting. You're really motivated to play again, and I've just been sitting there playing this thing for hours and hours and hours. I think it's so good.
It's so lively and exciting. We've come a long way since fucking Space Cadet on Windows.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking of when you said Xenotilt actually. Yeah, it looks really good. I like that you've had multiple entries so far of like, bet you didn't hear that, see that one coming, did you?
Not anymore. They're all conservative as shit. Here on out.
Yeah, mine are all pretty conservative. So this is interesting.
Not at all. I haven't played that.
Oh, well, that's like, yeah, that's as, you know, that's as Kim Newman as the list gets really. But yeah, like it's, no, it looks really cool. I love the look of this.
The tables look like super, super neat. I really, yeah, I'm kind of curious about this. And I do like the idea of, you know, a kind of a simple thing done well is something that I always enjoy in games.
And so the idea of something I've not really thought about or engaged with in a video game for a long time, like pinball being done in this quite radical way, having this story element, having all these different kind of mechanics coming off of it. That is cool, man. I like the sound of that.
So, yeah, an interesting pick for sure. Yeah, good stuff.
The music sounds a bit like Ace Attorney also, which is like an extra tick.
The real reason it's on the list emerges. No, it sounds good.
Miles Edgeworth comes out of the, that's the final stage, comes out of the middle table and you just have to fire, fire balls into his mouth.
That's like a bit for us to do at some point is Matthew comes up with like guest DLC for Ace Attorney in every other game that came out in like 20 out of 20 games.
I thought you were gonna say two giant men design a pinball table and you're like that is deep into like the 600s, you know?
Yeah, if we get that far, that's deep in the mid 40s energy to that one, I think. Yeah, very cursed. Okay, Matthew, my number eight is the far more recognizable Still Wakes the Deep, the first person horror game, second first person horror game on here, Slash Walking Simulator, a little bit of both, I think, because that's very much the Chinese room's DNA.
The developer of this, set on an oil rig off the coast of Scotland in the 1970s, essentially disaster strikes and your character who has a checkered past back on land, has to work out a way to get off this rig and also save his colleagues and friends on there, while avoiding numerous The Thing style monsters on there. I think it's okay to say that at this point, this game's been around for a while now. But without spoiling it, some of those monster designs are absolutely phenomenal.
That's part of the magic of this game. The way the 70s setting is realized in terms of the tactile feeling tech, and just the sense of place, and the amazing Scottish voice cast gives it such a specific flavor. And I'm rewarding that as much as I'm rewarding the game, which is the game is a fairly conventional first-person kind of horror-based experience, I would say.
There's nothing about it that's radical as such. Though it is more mechanically in-depth than the Chinese Rooms games previously were. You do have to find ways to avoid the monsters, to get the monsters to kind of leave you by creating noise in the distance and basically creating distractions for them in order to survive.
It's got a little bit more going on mechanics-wise. So I appreciate the fact that it wasn't just another walking simulator. I feel like that genre did max out a few years ago, and there isn't necessarily more to say about it after Edith Finch.
I think taking a step further into survival horror was the right move for this game.
Yeah, yeah.
I really liked it. I thought it was great. I think it's getting a bit of notice on end of year lists, and I think it deservedly so.
Like I say though, I think it's the tone and the effort put into script writing, narrative design, all of that. I think it's the exact right combination of things that I just thought deserves rewarding from this. It felt quite original to me.
What do you think?
Yeah, no, I absolutely agree with you. I love that there is a bit more going on under the hood. For most people, they would probably come at it like it was an alien isolation.
A lot of bits in this game is where you chuck hammers from one end of a big room to the other while an angry Scottish head with tentacles kind of writhes around and swears at you, which is obviously delightful. But yeah, it's the stuff in between I really loved. You know, the oil rig itself, the way they established the characters.
Like it's almost a shame, like how quickly the horror element kicks off. Like I would happily probably spend like another half an hour just hanging out with all these dudes, because the next time you meet them, they're not really up for chatting.
There's no ox patting in this game at all. You get one very short room of it and that's it really.
Yeah, and it's just great dialogue, authentic enough that they needed to add traditional English subtitles for non-Scottish audiences. Well, not us, but probably Americans. Yeah, fantastic, like what I call place and they really get it.
Every bit of the oil rig is used. Feels like you really go around the houses in it, which I enjoyed.
Yeah, this is my game pass hall of famer from this year as well, because it's six hours long and so it's kind of perfect for a subscription service like that. You can just kind of blast through it a few evenings. I've recommended it to so many people who like games, but are not in our kind of like, don't play as much as we do.
People who maybe play like two to five games a year. This is the game I've been recommending to people. It's like, oh, you got to play this.
And if you got an Xbox PC, just play on there, you know.
It's like, FIFA and this. Yeah, if you like FIFA, you know what you're going to love. Yeah, a game that also has Scottish people in it.
Yeah, I imagine this will end up being quite a big BAFTA game next year, because it's just, but it deserves it. That's what BAFTA is for, is for celebrating this kind of thing.
I feel like it definitely was overlooked in like writing and voice acting awards.
Yeah.
Because that, like, there are a few better written games this year and very few better performed.
Yeah, I read it. Yeah, those parts of the game, it's just, yeah, there's just a lot of craft in it. Lots to appreciate.
And yeah, I hope that developer gets to keep making games on this scale that have this level of production values. Because I do think you see some cool shit in those six hours. It doesn't feel like a cheap game.
And I think maybe traditionally that you don't necessarily associate the walking simulators with spectacle necessarily. But this game sure has it. Yeah, really thought the monsters were great in this.
Especially the big head that Matthew leads to. That fucking ruled. What's your number seven, Matthew?
My number seven is Dragon's Dogma 2.
Higher on my list.
Oh, we finally have crossover.
Finally. My number seven is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
Higher on my list.
Okay, so what's your number six?
Animal Well. Is this on your list?
It's not.
Last year, we disagreed on Tears of the Kingdom. This is this year's Tears of the Kingdom, I think.
Right.
We were just on a slightly different page with it. One man project by some called Billy Basso, working as the studio shared memory. You play a small blob who descends to the bottom of a big well, where there are lots of animals, thus Animal Well, and you have to light some flames to get out of it.
It is a kind of puzzle platformer with Metroidvania elements, in that you are collecting tools to help you push further out. Why would Savo is that, like there are lots of Metroidvania around, they have been over the last few years, and some of the tricks and things they do, like begin to blur together a little bit, you know, the same kind of progression and backtracking rhythms and structures, and you just, you begin to feel like, oh, it's this bit of the game where we're doing this thing. I actually liked how Animal World kind of mixed up the formula, you know, for one, you can kind of go in like any one of four directions from where the game starts.
You can kind of tackle the four challenges of the game in any order. It's quite organic in that way. It's not as tied to the equipment as Metroidvania's can be.
They tend to be rewards for finishing a particular path full of puzzles, more puzzles than platforming. The actual platforming in this game is really very limited. Like you've got quite a small jump.
And when you do get to the end of those paths and start collecting these pieces of equipment, they're all quite interesting, I think, like they don't just take the standards of the genre. You know, the first few things you get are like a slinky, a frisbee, a firework, and, you know, it has slightly quirky mechanics tied to those, and puzzles I hadn't seen, you know, I'd seen variations on them, but nothing, you know, exactly like this, just because the items behave differently. But like I say, like, much of this game is a kind of a less about bringing this item to this place, and more about just sort of figuring out the mysterious vibes of the animal well, you know, often using hostile animals and turning them to your advantage by using their particular behaviors to solve bigger puzzles.
It's a game that famously kind of goes a lot deeper than it first appears. I'd say there are like three levels to it. You have the kind of top level where you're trying to achieve this basic goal of getting out of the well.
And then there's a second level where you're, finding these hidden eggs, which I would actually lump in and say is part of the main quest line and should be considered part of the main quest line because in that stretch of the game, once you've like learnt the basic skills and whatnot, you're finding your inventory doubles in size. There's twice as much game as there initially appears. The map is much bigger than you think it's gonna be.
Rooms you've been in previously can be quite dramatically reinvented by this late game equipment. And I thought that was quite thrilling, just the density of discoveries and surprises in this space. On top of that, there is this third level, which I didn't really get into.
Like, it's very cryptic stuff. You know, there's like code breaking and stuff to do with speed running. And, you know, it's a game that's been designed to be played kind of by the community and people helping each other out.
There's literally a puzzle which you need. I think it's 59 other players to solve. You will get like a bit of a puzzle to put together.
And all that's very playful, but don't feel like you're getting shortchanged or you're not seeing what animal well is by not engaging with that. Like that stuff'sâ¦ it's a little bit smug, to be honest.
That level of the game. And I was in this review discord when we were reviewing this and I enjoyed it up to a point. Like I enjoyed talking to fellow journalists about where do we think this egg is or whatever.
But when some people pulled ahead into the even deeper like meta stuff, I was like, no thanks, like this just isn't for me, I don't need to do any of this. And, you know, so if you have read about that stuff, don't be put off by it. This isn't like, you know, the Witness style kind of wankfest or anything like that.
It's, you know, there is a very accessible, enjoyable puzzle adventure game. And that's what I really reacted to. I had a fucking fantastic time, like, you know, 10 to 15 hours or whatever it was, kind of quizzing my way through this weird world, getting little chinchillas to do my bidding, shitting myself when a giant ghost fox chased me.
I'm sad it didn't click with everyone, but yeah, I love this. One of my only platinum trophies on PlayStation, this game.
Oh, right, wow, okay, that is in deep. Yeah, I still have no platties to my name, Matthew.
You know what my other platinum trophy is?
Is it Astro Bot?
Well, yeah, that was my other one from this year, but my third one that I have from the past is, of course, it's the Centennial Case.
Yeah, okay. I feel like I should start-
Only the Primo Platt's Foward Castle.
Yeah, I feel like I should start doing the Paranormousite thing with that, where I go like, what's the subtitle to Centennial Case?
Yeah, it's Centennial Case. Is it a Shijima story?
A Shijima story? I should start saying that after you start saying the Centennial Case, because it does seem to come up.
That can be your new bit for 2020.
Yeah, I look forward to it. It should be good. I feel like that game somehow comes up every episode now.
I don't know how that's happened. It's either that or it should be a scramble will come up. Or Paranormal Sight.
It's that trilogy, basically, of games. Okay. Well, yeah, I don't want to repeat what I talked about last week.
So I feel like I said my piece on it. It doesn't need more dunking when you are praising it. Yeah, I think my feeling was a little bit that the true triumph of this game was marketing, that being associated with a YouTuber allowed it to get a level of sort of attention and success that a similarly budgeted and good metroidvania would just vanish on Steam without a trace.
I felt like that was the real triumph of this game in a lot of ways, was fostering that attention. And I'm not saying that's not a skill, because I work in games marketing. It is.
But in some ways, I think that maybe has overpowered the narrative of what the game actually is. Or at least that's how I felt at the time when it was released. But here we are a few months later.
I do feel like it was on people's radars before Dunkey or whatever his studio is called, you know, decided to publish it. And, you know, this bloke, I've just been listening to his episode of My Perfect Consul, actually, Billy Basso's episode. And, you know, he just did it all by himself.
I think he's just like a really focused guy, made a very specific thing, wanted it to have secrets that would last for months. Yeah, I just love the vibes of the thing. But I, you know, I do get it.
Like it's, it has the look from afar of something that is going to be quite annoying. But I promised that I didn't find it annoying.
No, it's cool. It's a cool pick. I have no further notes, Matthew.
Yeah, that's okay.
Yeah, okay.
We will never talk of Animal Well again.
Who knows? Maybe I'll get to it at some point. It's on the old Switch.
I've given up on, what's it called? The Lucas Pope game. So that's now...
Oh, what a heartbreaker, Obra Dinn.
Obra Dinn. I just felt like, I felt like work to me, man. It's just not my sort of thing.
It's okay that I'm just not, I'm not a brain box like you. I don't think I have the... Genuinely, I'm too sort of C-grade GCSE.
Oh, I don't know if that's... I don't think that's true.
I think it is. There's some things like, I'm just, my magic is appearing smart, but not actually being smart. There's like, there's nothing underneath it.
It's all bluster. That's my whole thing, basically.
I'm sure people... I appear silly, but I'm secretly like, reasonably smart.
I appear silly.
I do appear quite silly.
But yeah, that's, you know...
My worst nightmare is that anyone thinks I'm a serious person.
All right then, my number six, very different vibes, is Space Marine 2, third person action game. As mentioned earlier, about eight hours long. Shooter and action game, really.
Lets you be a Space Marine, a sequel to a, I think a 2011 or 2012 THQ game that was developed by Relic. This is not developed by Relic, completely different developer. Saber Interactive.
I believe this is mostly made in Europe this game, even though the devs, who I think have been out there talking about it, are based in the US. That's actually like something you suss out when you watch the end credits of this, I would say. So I think this game is great for a few reasons.
It's a really nicely paced third person, kind of like cover style shooter from the time. You don't use cover because you are a Space Marine, you are superhuman, you don't need to be in cover. It's a game of clearing out hordes of tyranids and later on lots of chaos monsters that turn up.
With your two pals, you can play them as AI companions or you can have real humans drop in with you, and you are running through basically a ton of scripted set pieces on a gothic looking Warhammer 40,000 worlds. In between missions, going to your little citadel or something wherever space marines hang out in between. But you get so much Warhammer 40,000 spectacle for your buck here.
And even if you're not really engaged with it, and I'm not really engaged with this universe that much, I appreciate the iconography and the sort of craft that goes into it. I think this game is really good at making it seem incredibly exciting. It celebrates it really well.
It makes the space marines seem just rad as fuck. And the weapons are just really kind of like beefy feeling. The melee combat is well judged.
There's not tons and tons of depth to it, but it didn't need depth. And I think the fact that its success does speak to the fact that people are after games that are 10 hours or less and offer a lot of value in those 10 hours. I think this really does.
And it was sold at like 50 quid or something like that. It's a proper like 360 hours game. But it looks absolutely top of the range.
It's the first thing I played on my new gaming PC. And I found I locked into it, playing it on PC way more than I did on console. It's just, it sounds so good.
It looks so good. It really just, it felt like, actually feels like properly next gen when you play it on a beefy PC. So I really rate this.
And then like since then, they've been adding to the multiplayer element of it. And if you jump into that, you get different enemies to fight and like different missions to do. And I don't think it's necessarily got like the longest tail in the world to it, but I don't think it needed to.
I think what it was just really ticked a box for me this year. So, to have like one scripted shootery thing from this year, I thought about Call of Duty Black Ops 6. It's pretty close.
But I thought I only wanted to be on your list from how you spoke about it.
I really liked it. I thought I thought like there are still some like cool missions in the second half. I think the first half was like the real highlight of it.
It's only because I only wanted to have one of this kind of type of scripted action game on my list, even though I do have two first person horror games on the list, I guess. But they're very different, still wakes the deep in mouth washing. So, Space Marine 2 just nudges ahead a tiny bit for me.
So, that felt like the right pick. And yeah, I just, by the end of it, I was like, God damn, if I can play, if there are like five more games like this about different Warhammer 40,000 factions that they can make to this standard, I think that they could just be huge. This could just go on and on.
So, I do hope that that happens off the back of this. But yeah, if you want like the highest quality 360 throwback you can imagine, that's what this game is and good for them, I say, Matthew. Thoughts?
Yeah, that's great. So, I played this at Gamescom last year and I remember thinking, like, there's such ambition to this and it ran like shit at Gamescom on the PCs that they had and I thought if they can tidy this up and like make it work, it's gonna, you know, just as the sensation of like mulching thousands of enemies and the way it sells the even bigger scale of the army with like what's going on in the backgrounds and things in the sky and all that, you know, it really, you can't really see the seams of like where the enemies you're fighting and the enemies of the fake background war kind of begin and end. But it, like you said, it was so rough, I'm really, and it was meant to be coming out like in 2023.
I remember thinking like there's no way this is going to like tidy up. And I'm just glad that it got the time. It clearly needed to like really land that because it's a great, you know, trick or visual effect.
Yeah, it really is. And it's funny to see that their new Turret game looks like the same thing basically, but with dinosaurs. But that's all right.
I think that it's okay to basically they got their own little third person swarm based kind of like corner of the shooter market. And I think that's a cool thing to be able to own. Yeah, so I mentioned this level last week, but the last level of this really does deliver.
It's a proper sort of like I think it at first, the first couple of levels, I was like, this is good. But I don't know if this gets to those like gears of war heights of spectacle. And then it really, really does.
You just have to bear with it. There's an amazing bit where there's loads of Imperial Guard going across this bridge where you're kind of like fighting in parallel to them alongside. And then yeah, some of the stuff that kicks off in that last level is just absolutely amazing.
It really does deliver on that side. So good for them. It's one of those nice success stories from this year, Matthew.
Hooray.
What's your number five?
It's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
Ah, we finally get there. Two places apart after all that, Matthew.
Yeah, not much in it.
Not really. No. Do you want to kick off?
Yeah, like we've talked about this game a lot this year. I obviously went in quite hard and fast on it when it came out and had a really, really good time. I absolutely love this game.
I've talked a lot about its wild excess and how that spoke to me, and that is definitely what I'm reacting to on some level. Like just the amazement that no one seemingly said no to like anything in this game. You know, be it like a mini game for every activity, loads of cutscenes, boss fights, locations, tiny locations blown out into massive locations.
Like changes and extensions, they simply didn't need to do to sort of pay any kind of homage to the original Final Fantasy VII. I mean, Gongaga, a place you can walk past in Final Fantasy VII, is turned into like a massive jungle with rubbery mushrooms and like a huge children's choir singing this sort of Earth song. It's balmy, like how overblown this is.
And I do like that and respond to that because, not because I'm shallow, I just, I like it when people go all out and just take endless swings. I probably like this game as much as a soundtrack, as I do a game, you know, along the same lines as Kid Icarus Uprising, or the Smash Brothers games. It's just an epic audio project.
And that stuff, you know, means a lot to me. I listen to it all the time. I think it's banger after banger.
I even like the terrible kind of sort of J-pop song about the dog. The one that goes bow wow wow bow wow wow. But if you put all that aside, because we have talked about that particular stuff over and over again, under it all, I do fundamentally rate what they've done with it.
You know, I think whichever bit of Final Fantasy VII you love, and it's a game with a hundred things that mean a huge amount of different people, I feel like that moment will have been treated with care, maybe changed beyond recognition, but they will have pumped so much sort of just budget into it and make sure it is here in some way. I'd say most of it is successful for me, bar Shinra Mansion. Maybe we can talk about that in a sec.
I just think they make the party feel a lot more relevant as a group through this stretch of the story. Like, if you don't have the party with you in Final Fantasy VII, often they just vanish for hours upon end and may as well not exist. Here, you know, everyone has stuff to do, a part to play in combat, there are sections which push different characters to the fore.
It's where a lot of the bloat comes from, it's how a 15 hour game becomes a 90 hour game or whatever, just because it's trying to make sure everyone is accounted for. I just think you have a much better sense of them, like I think Barrett, Yuffie, Aerith in particular, way more appealing to me in this game than I think they were the OG. For this stretch of the story at least.
I like the variety of enemies and the boss fights, I like the puzzle solving element of the combat, how do you stagger these things, every new creature is a new thing you have to figure out. So it isn't just the I like all this shit, I do like the mechanics of the battling, I like the characters in the party. As someone who doesn't have a deep emotional tie to the OG Final Fantasy 7, I thought this kind of gave me exactly what I wanted really.
But I am interested to hear your thoughts now that you have valiantly finished Rebirth.
Yeah, it was something I felt like I owed the listeners was to finish this podcast. And it is so long, this game. It's a real double-edged sword for me.
I think I agree with a lot of what you say there. Much the same as I did felt this way about Remake, I think that Rebirth, sort of like the combat system, every single character feels like you're playing their own action game or their own kind of like action RPG, like within this larger game. They feel so meaningfully different.
They're very generously designed characters. It makes total sense that you only get Red 13 and Yuffie as the new party members in this one and that they're waiting to give you Sid and Vincent in the next one because...
And Kate Sith.
Oh, and Kate Sith. Sorry.
Also fuck Kate Sith.
Yeah, also fuck Kate Sith. I like that rolling the dice and seeing what happens there, but they do just feel mechanically distinct from each other in this really, you know, it's in a way that's completely next level compared to how different they are in the original FF7. In a lot of ways, they largely behave the same.
They just have a few different specific abilities. I mean, the way that material works is basically built to, you know, in some ways homogenize your party because you can just move sets of material between party members. This game is built so each character feels specific and the dynamics in combat therefore change depending on which one you're controlling and which ones you choose to add to your party.
Love all of that. The presentation is amazing. It is like the proper, this is what people, I think, think of as AAAXS, I think, because there's just so much here in terms of minigames, in terms of worlds.
Something I really like about the open worlds, which I think are a bit of a mixed bag in terms of activities, you will burn out a little bit on the things they get you doing in these open worlds. But I love that they are all different to navigate, to traverse. They all have different methods of navigation.
The Gongarga region has the chocobos bounce you between bits of the environment. I saw some critics didn't really like that, but that was actually my favorite part of the open world. I really love that area.
I guess maybe I'm the only Gongarga stan. I didn't mind that section of the game. And I just really like that.
It just made the areas of the world felt really distinct. It really does give you the open world Final Fantasy, the open world Final Fantasy that you imagine in your head when you're going around in that world map in the original game. I think it's really generous on that front.
Were you impressed when you get the boat? Were you surprised that actually you could navigate the world?
No, I think that nothing tops getting the buggy in this game. I think when you leave Goldsauce and you have the buggy in there, so I was like, oh, that's really cool that they did this. I thought that was the method of transportation you were alluding to as a really cool thing.
No, it was more like, oh, there's literally a physical body of what... These locations are actually part of a coherent, connected open world.
Yeah.
You don't really realize it until you've sailed across a very boring, empty ocean. All that. But I imagine there's some trickery there and they don't really coexist.
But I was surprised that they had attempted the world basically.
Yeah. It's a classic Jack and Daxter loading world in the background thing, I think, so it seems seamless. I mean, I'm sure the SSD is going into overdrive when those areas are loading.
Yeah. Really impressive. It makes you realize they probably are going to do the high wind in part three.
They probably are going to let you fly between bits of this physically, which is an exciting prospect because they have to scale, built this world basically more or less. They've built it to scale. It's very impressive.
What else do I like? I think the combat system is like the mix of tactical pause and real-time action. It's particularly great for regular enemies you face in the game.
I think that's where it works really well. I think where it falls down is when you have boss encounters and bosses do lots of animation bullshit that locks you into moves. They do flurry attacks, knock you down with all kinds of bullshit.
You have to watch along animation while some nonsense happens. None of that really happens when you're fighting the enemies in the open world, but you still get all these encounters where it is stimulating to go through it and to figure it out and I think they've really like ratcheted up what that combat system is capable of from remake. I felt like I was wondering if it was nearing its limits in remake a little bit, but then this game just shows, it makes you think so much more about how you stagger enemies, like you say.
Right, there's some positivity.
Okay, go on then.
I think this game has the worst pacing of any game I've played this year, and that's why I didn't get my top five. I'm glad you actually didn't put it right near the top of your list.
Do you think I was going to make this my number one or something?
I did wonder if it would be in your top three, and I think those pacing issues are near fatal. I actually, in retrospect, didn't mind the Cat Sith mansion stuff as much, because I thought that the end of the game felt so, so protracted, without spoiling it, but I mean, everyone knows who's played FF7, that you go to the city of the Ancients at the end. There's some rudimentary puzzle stuff that plays out in the area that goes on for hours and hours, and I found that so boring.
That, combined with the fact that, yeah, like any little bit of the game from the original, they can protract into a four-hour dungeon or a side quest or something, I just felt like, I thought, as a man who surely thinks a lot about how games are paced, like this game, this is easily the downside of this game. The bloat is out of control, and you could slice multiple hours out of this and improve the game, and there's no other game I played this year where I feel that's the case, but I think that those pacing issues, combined with the fact that the finale feels like it goes on forever in this game, multiple boss fights back to back, means that I just think it makes it harder to love than I expected based on the reviews.
Right, yeah, I do see that. I think, I don't know, the way I played it, like even though I played it in a more intensive burst much earlier on, I spent, I did a lot of the side activity and the world activity and that, you know, it makes it an even longer game, but it also puts a bit of distance between like, the dungeons and the story and like the heavy boss bits and you know, you can go for a long stretch of time without any of that. And I think that helps break it up and it maybe seems less egregious.
Like I genuinely didn't have, you know, I've seen, you know, basically you're running commentary on this on the Discord. And I was dreading it. I was like, oh God, he's having such a bad time with this.
This is going to be, this is going to be a difficult one to talk about.
It's got some low lows this game.
It has got some, I do think they are accentuated if you're trying to take this game at a clip. And it is designed, you know, and I think we discussed this, you know, on DMs or something that I feel like it's, it's imagining a player who does all that stuff to level up. And if you don't engage with all that side activity, like the difficulty or there are certain difficulty spikes that can get away from you a little bit and become very frustrating.
Yeah.
You know, because there were bits even, even spending all that time doing it where I felt like I had to dial it right down because it was, I was getting my ass handed to me. That fucking, like the Vincent stuff in Shinra Mansion, I thought was really difficult. That I fight against.
That I did. I did that first time, the Vincent one. But I think the problem with it is, the game becomes a bit addicted to knocking your squad mates out as a part of the struggle of the combat.
And so I think in the second half of the game, you start to lose the feeling of empowerment of controlling these characters unless, like you say, you get very far ahead of that curve and do loads of open world activities and that too is a flaw, I think.
Yeah, yeah. And so, you know, I do see all that and I definitely agree with the ending. I actually, having now played, and obviously the ending to this and the ending to disc one of OG Final Fantasy 7 are quite different in terms of, you know, this one has always like meta shit, but I don't, as a beat, probably one of the most famous story beats in gaming, I don't really rate it.
I don't really like it. I don't think either is particularly effective. I find both story bits very confusing about what's going on, what could be achieved, what's being sacrificed.
I mean, this one adds all this meta stuff on top, so it's even more confusing. But like, you know, I'm not precious about how, you know, did they butcher the end of disc one? It's like, I don't think it's a particularly great moment.
Like on paper, what happens is cool and interesting and emotional, but like what the deal is, like Sephiroth and the motivation is pretty confusing to me.
So he just wants Black Materia to destroy the planet. Then he's going to use a planet to cruise around the universe, basically finding other planets.
What's her role in? I don't really get her role in all of it.
I thought she was like something about the White Materia and stopping the Black Materia from actually happening. Like it was the what she was doing, the praying was part of stopping what happens at the end, because doesn't like Black Materia burn up from the Aerith livestream stuff. Sorry, I'm spoiling the end of Final Fantasy VII for you there.
No, but it's, well, I don't understand it. Both of them were a bit of a shock to me, to be honest.
Well, I do have another thought on this, which is I still think that this would be better if it was a straight FF7 remake for a few reasons, because it is in conversation with the original game. It's like you say, there is some meta stuff in this. That was pretty obvious from playing the original as well.
But here, they really triple down on it. I would say that's a missed opportunity to just condense the Midgar section and condense what's here into one great game that retells that story for the simple reason of you want to make this story relevant to today's players. That's surely like the upside of remaking it, so millions more people can discover it.
But instead, it boxes itself in as like a thing to be appreciated by existing fans. And I think that's maybe like a missed opportunity. I just think that it's so simple, the visual presentation of the original, that a straight remake would be absolutely fine.
I mean, we've seen this with the Rezzy series. Those Rezzy remakes work really well because they are faithful to the original thing, give or take a fucking tower from Rezzy 3 or whatever. But here, it's like, yeah, it just has to do something else.
It has to serve some other master. And I think that existing fans feel a little bit frustrated by it. And if you're completely new to it, this could be completely baffling some of the events in this game.
And so I think that's a weakness as well. But I do still like it. I think that, I think, yeah, high highs and low lows.
It's again, it's almost exactly how I felt about remake, except you have the bonus here of it's in an open world as opposed to a very small amount of real estate in one city.
Where did you land on Queen's Blood by the end? Yeah, your name.
I'm still mixed on it. One, okay, so the music is banging, obviously. And some of the strategies that emerge are really good.
It's a bit like, why aren't there more opponents in it? It's quite, it's like actually a bit, it feels like a bit of a half-bedger, because in the first half of the game, they're like, oh yeah, Queen's Blood, you know, got this tournament on the boat, all this stuff. And then I feel like you run out of people to play Queen's Blood against in the second half of the game.
It almost feels like there's more they could have done than they didn't do. But I think that-
Yeah, I mean, there are people in the world, you maybe have to look for them a bit harder, and there are certain locations you can go to to play just the shit ton of Queen's Blood. Like in Custodale Soul, you can go and do the puzzle variation of it, and that's really fun.
They're really good, yeah.
Yeah, that stuff's great. Yeah, I mean, as someone who really like Queen's Blood, I feel like I played, like, I don't know, 20 hours of Queen's Blood in this game or something. Like, I feel like I played maybe not as much as I played Gwent, but close.
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.
Oh, it sounds so good at the start. You're like, yes, this is on.
It's got a lot to it in terms of, basically it's a game all about finding your one or two bullshit go-to strategies, and then using that to exploit some poor AI over and over again, or before the AI kills you with their bullshit strategies. That is the game, and I think that does create this thing of either massive success or massive failure, and it's not really an in-between, do you know what I mean? There's never really a game of Queen's Blood that ends with, well, whatever.
It's more, it's a bit like, ha ha ha ha, or I'm about to throw my controller, and nothing in between, so. Yeah, a weird game from this year. What a strange old blockbuster they made, with the bones of Final Fantasy VII, disc one.
Yeah, very odd. Yeah, I think, me putting it at seven is me saying, I don't think this is among the very best games of this year.
And that's okay.
Yeah, but it's special in numerous ways. Baffling in others.
Our friendship can continue. It will survive this.
This is not even nearly as tense as Tears of the Kingdom last year, where just, that was a much like, yeah, that was a much more challenging for the friendship, I'd say. God, I've been talking for ages, Matthew, but we're coming to my number, my number five here. I've gone with Silent Hill 2 Remake.
Now-
It isn't in my list.
I will caveat this by saying I have not finished this. I'm 80 something percent of the way through, according to my PS5 menu screen. But I had to put it in here, because I think it is a wonderful way to experience what Konami's Team Silent came up with in 2001.
This boundary pushing in terms of theme, Jacob's Ladder infused horror game about a small town where almost everything you encounter seems to be, it's either spaced out residents who seem trapped there, or monsters that seem to represent some part of the subconscious of James Sunderland, the protagonist. And I think there was, I mean, there was a relentless amount of skepticism towards this being by Bloober Team, who made the medium of games that people are not very fond of. However, I think it is absolutely brilliant.
It's got, it's very faithful in a lot of ways, and it's got some things it does that the original couldn't do that I think are its own, to its own merit as well. The absolute magic trick of this game to me is the way it uses the mannequin enemies in the game is fucking brilliant, because in the original game, I didn't really think about them at all. They are freaky and you do, you know, and they do come out of nowhere sometimes and you do fight them, but I don't, this game, because you've got a 3D camera, it's over the shoulder, they do all kinds of things with silhouette, with hiding them, with having them scuttle out from under tables, from having them just there in plain sight for you to realize they're there or not realize they're there.
I think some of the room placements in this game, like when you're going through the hospital or the apartments or the prison, it's just like such, it's like A plus horror design, just really surprising and scary and brilliant. There's so many bits where I went, or I wasn't even necessarily scared, I was like, well done, like genuine round of applause. That's fucking amazing how you use this one enemy type to freak me out.
I think that combined with the fact that the narrative stuff really lands in this, they've kept the other worldly feel of the story, the slightly spaced out nature of all the residents is still here, and the fact that you can't really crack what's going on behind James' eyes as such, and why he's so doggedly persistent, and then the truth of what's going on in the story obviously emerges deeper into it. I think the fact that they've just, that's executed at such a high level, all the narrative stuff, it's a really beautiful looking game as well. I think it really pushes what you can do with tech.
It's a small location, but it's got a phenomenal amount of detail. I think this is brilliant. I think this might even be slightly more faithful to its source material than the Resi remakes are.
Yeah. What do you think, Matthew?
No, I see that. I think you've overtaken me in this now. And yeah, I kind of liked how sort of hands off they've been in a way, like to let the original speak.
They've done loads to it and it is greatly changed. But it feels very 20 years ago in just that you're kind of left to your own devices. You know, you're pottering around this.
It just feels like a map full of enemies waiting to jump out and get you. But it feels like a huge map. And you're just sort of taking it at your own pace.
You know, occasionally there are these very artful cutscenes. And obviously this is a game with some like incredible character beats and revelations, you know, hiding away in those. And so those cutscenes really land.
But like, it just feels like you're playing without being pestered by like weird interactive cutscenes. There's no ox patting. It's very stripped back.
It's just like you in spooky ass buildings, combat and puzzles. And there's something kind of old fashioned about that that I really liked.
I think that's really struck a chord with people. I think people wanted that from a survival horror experience this year as well.
Yeah.
And the fact that it's in Silent Hill 2's clothing just is, you know, it's a great sort of vessel for the type of experience it is. I think in some ways that creates some limitations. Like the amount of enemy types, it's like, it feels very PS2 in that respect.
There's a bit of repetition there. But they've ratcheted up so much with presentation. Like the sound design is amazing as well.
How they use the radio coming out of the dual-sense controller is brilliant, as you pointed out previously Matthew, but also just like things like where you go into the yard in the gallows in the prison area, and like the noises you hear of what is clearly something out there. Just like little moments like that where you're going through the apartments, it's just so good at shitting you up in so many ways. They've thought so precisely about how to mess you up at different moments to do fake outs with the radio, have an enemy seem near then disappear.
They even treat themselves to a little cheeky early appearance of Pyramid Head standing in red light, which absolutely freaked me out. Just, it's very nicely done. And yeah, I think it's way better than anyone thought it would be.
And yeah, I think it's despite its simplicity is a strength, I think. So yeah, it's really, really something. Yeah, Sun Hill 2 remake.
I'm looking forward to getting to the very end of it, but not one part of it has disappointed me so far. It probably does peak around the hospital or the prison, like depending on the type of play you are. I think the hospital probably is the peak.
But yeah, like I say, it's amazing that the Mannequins have managed to upstage the nurses. The nurses were like this iconic, the enemy from this game. But I think that the Mannequins, I think they're just the designers at Bloober just looked at them and went, right, let's get to work.
Let's do every conceivable fucked up thing we can with these things. Absolutely love that. So, yeah.
Brainstorming. What's the worst thing a Mannequin can do? Go.
Yeah, it's great stuff, Matthew. What's your number four?
My number four is Rise of the Golden Idol.
Not on my list.
By Colour Grade Games. I loved Case of the Golden Idol. When it came out a couple of years ago, it's basically a series of short murder mysteries presented as little dioramas.
You look at them, you collect all the terms, and then you insert those terms into a written account of the scene to show that you've understood what's happening. Lots of sort of deduction puzzles, a little bit over-diney in the way that you kind of absorb information and have to match different pieces of information to get your answers. It's, you know, you have to trust me on that front, it really works.
But I think what I really appreciated about this and it goes for the original too, but often I think my favourite bit of reading mystery stories and obviously I read a lot of like Japanese crime, but also other mysteries, it's probably like the opening of books where you see the cast list, you find out like the location that the book is going to be set in, you know, you're waiting for that first death to happen, you maybe don't know who's actually going to be killed.
And it's always a stretch of a book where your like brain is at its most active, you know, it's whirring up, it's developing theories, doesn't even have a death to play with, but it's just a really exciting kind of like possibility space, I guess, and that only grows more limited when you're reading books, as detectives begin to sort of tick off certain things or work out, well, it can't have been this. And so like for me, books always start at their best. And I think The Rise of the Golden Idol, you know, because it is built from these like enclosed, sort of self-contained vignettes, it feels like diving into, you know, 15 or however many cases there are, but say 15 like murder novels, mystery novels in a row.
It's that constant thrill of clicking on the next chapter and seeing like where we are, what's happening, who's died, has anyone died at all? And that, I think, really is the magic of the game. It's just this constant being plunged into, oh, shit, I can't wait to figure this out, you know, why are we at a barbecue?
You know, why is a man doing a weird interpretive dance? How is this auction I can see about to go horribly wrong? You know, it's a game of just constant, oh, I can't wait to dig into this and get, you know, kind of tuck into this.
And I just, I don't want to say I'd play like a hundred of these cases. As long as they keep making more mysteries like this, I will just keep playing them and really digging them. And, you know, they've promised a year of DLC for this one.
But I just, I'm just desperate for people to go all in on this, just so they keep making them. Colour Gray Games should never be free from the Golden Idol. I just, this is it.
This is what I want, you know. Let this be like Morse and run for 20 years, you know?
You know what? I did go and play the original after you talked about this on the podcast about a month ago. And it is a really great formula.
I can see exactly why this has like sunk its claws into people. It's just such a brilliant container for mysteries. Like the ways in which you can layer complexity on top of it, just gives it this, yeah, like so much potential to tell different types of stories.
Really good. I got a couple of friends playing this off the back of like one Blue Sky post I did for this. They got way more into it than I even did.
This is a bit of a like, I want to play it on my parents' couch over Christmas kind of game for me. I want to sink into it then. But yeah, it's cool that this has really struck a chord with you.
And it feels like this, the first one, like got a bit of attention and was snowballed and success. I feel like this got a lot of attention from people. So it's found its audience.
It helps that it's all on Netflix. You know, you can just play out on your phone. Yeah, good stuff Matthew.
I'm pleased that these live up to your very high standards for Detective Games.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay. Cool.
What's your next one? Your number four.
My number four is Astro Bot.
Not on my list.
Oh, you shit lord. Oh, come on. Really?
I just had 10 other things I wanted to talk about.
Yeah, pinball over Astro Bot. All right.
I mean, I think it's great.
But like I said, it's Astro Bot is probably 11.
Funny, because I feel like about a month ago, I asked you Astro Bot is going to be on your list, right? You went, yeah. I think you literally said yes in response to that.
I think when we were at pizza.
Yeah, it's been knocked out, so I played something else I preferred.
I don't know. I think that's such a Nintendo head take that is.
I think like, did I put a single Nintendo game in this list?
Well, no, but we know what you're comparing. We know the prism through which you look at Astrobot, Matthew. It's been established on the phone.
I thought it would be a more interesting list to talk about things.
Yeah, I mean, Astrobot is not short of a claim. That is true. I think that this belongs on a top 10 of the year that's got rebirth on it personally.
But to each their own, Matthew, that's entirely up to you. I think with a bit of time to cool off from this, I just dropped into the Christmas level they gave away for free this week and just rediscovered all of the different platforming mechanics they put in here, the monkey climbing, the stopping time, all that business. Just going through another hub world just reminded me of what a generous and delightful game this was.
Perhaps was not best experienced when churning through it, like back to back in a couple of weekends, which is how I did it. And then getting, I think, like the weakness of this game that we acknowledged as a factor was the fact that there is no there is no normal difficulty in this game. There's easy levels and then there's the rock hard levels at the end.
And that kind of is, those are the two modes of this game. I think maybe like left a tiny bit of a sour taste in my mouth. But going back to it, just showing the casino level to a friend and just looking at some of the highlights from this and the different PlayStation past each levels they did, a really like generous great game.
People wanted a full, fat Astro Bot experience after playing Astro's Playroom when the PS5 launched and they got it and it really delivered. I think even though your PlayStation heritage interest or mileage might vary, it's a really great imaginative 3D platformer, a genre that doesn't really exist in much of a meaningful way these days, give or take the Mario games, there's not much really around. Even if the Mario games set a really high bar, I think to most people this is just a delightful experience this year.
To go back to, I actually did see a few levels where I was like, you know what, I do fancy dipping into that again. I do fancy being hosed down with delight again in the way that the Super Mario 3D world or 3D land did for me. It's definitely that mode of game it reminds me of.
Even if Astrobots, the iconography of all of its different enemies isn't terribly memorable, it's just that I think they get most of the basics spot on in terms of mechanics. So, yeah, I think this is a real highlight of this. It's just such an easy game to play through.
Like, something like Rebirth really felt like a challenge at times. This was like a warm knife through butter, this game. It was very easy to get through.
I accept all that. I think this is a tremendous game. Easily the best 3D platformer that isn't a Mario 3D platformer, for sure.
In any other year, it would be on my list. It was on my list. It got pushed out by something.
I had some late things added to this list. There were some things I wanted to celebrate. There were some things that, as I played, I thought, oh, I've got something a bit more to say about this than I do, Astro Bot.
Maybe that makes it a bit fake, see? You know, just trying to have a list that I thought I could say more about. I do think Astro Bot is great.
I think it has limitations as an actual platformer. But like you say, because of that difficulty gradient thing, and some of the PlayStation heritage stuff, doesn't really land for me. I don't really like the character levels, to be honest.
Really?
Yeah, I like the one which...
I like the LocoRoco one, because it is very different mechanically. But the other ones, I just felt like they were a bit undercut mechanically.
God of War Uncharted, those really landed for me. Horizon doesn't do much for me, but I thought those two were great. I mean, I don't know, they don't have to be like...
You know, reinvent the wheel just for a little Uncharted past these. It could just be a third-person shooter. It's not the end of the world.
That is true. But I did really like this game. This isn't me being like Nintendo weirdo.
It's better than any Nintendo game I played this year, for sure. But yeah, I just had other stuff I wanted to talk about.
Yep, fair enough. I mean, there's a little bit of that kind of curation that goes into the list. You know, it's...
Yeah. Like, I genuinely, I really fucking like that Bimbo game. Let's not put this on Xenotilt.
Let's not put this on Mini Shoot Adventures, a game that is superior to Astral Ball.
I'd rather come out of this episode with a new recommendation than like Astral Ball again. But...
Yeah, I guess so.
But then, you know...
Yeah, but that's... I don't know. The list serves multiple masters, I guess.
But yeah, the longer this is in the rear-view mirror, the more fond I am of it. I think it's a proper, like, if you get a PS5 day one, this would be on the list of games you would absolutely recommend, I think.
This and Stellar Blade.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, Stellar Blade for the dads, Astro Bot for the kids. Matthew's Cursed PS5 Bundle, available now from Curry's.
Okay, what's your number three, Matthew?
It's Balatro.
Higher on my list. My number three is Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown, the best game I played on Nintendo Switch this year. Absolutely.
High production values, Metroidvania by, I think, Ubisoft Montpellier, that team. Athletic, exciting, sort of like, Sekiro-ass action, Metroidvania game. Just really delivers spectacle, challenge, excitement, adventure.
It's a really like, it's just a really, it's everything you want from someone doing a big budget version of a genre that's become very indie oriented in recent years. In some ways, I think it's like the flip side of Metroid Dread. It's like what you would do with a more melee focused combat system and that kind of like way of making a Metroidvania as opposed to projectiles and technology.
It's much more about like, yeah, like magic powers and melee combat. And then, yes, like Dragon Ball Z ass, like finisher moves and bonus attacks and that kind of stuff. It has a great sort of like layered map for you to unpick.
It does everything you want from Metroidvania. The fact that it's a Ubisoft game, like maybe makes you think it's going to hold your hand a little more than it does. It's got a pretty tight parry window.
It's a pretty demanding game. You can change that, those settings if you want to. But I think the challenge is really part of the DNA of this game.
I think it's absolutely wonderful. And it seems like it's just not sold as much as it deserved. It's really been in the kind of like, get it for Â£15 on Black Friday deals, which is, I think, unbelievable.
This also shows that a game can still wow you on Switch when the developers really know what they're doing. This is just 60 FPS. How is it doing it?
I don't know. It looks absolutely amazing. I wonder if this game would feel a little bit like you've not really found the right home for it, playing it on a PS5 or an Xbox.
I do wonder if this is supposed to be experienced in a handheld way. Because in that way, I think it's very dazzling. But if it's next to all the other games you've got on your PS5, the visual achievement of it might be lost.
But yeah, I think this just really delivered for me. This is a start of the year game for me. I just could not put it down until it was done, until I did everything on the map.
I thought it was brilliant, Matthew. Thoughts?
I still haven't finished it. I'm only about seven hours into it. It came out, I was on Access, so many games having to cover it.
It just keeps slipping through the cracks. And it's one that when I have tried to go back to it, I've been like, I kind of need to start this from the beginning. Like I've lost all the muscle memory of it.
And it is a demanding game in that regard. But I was having an amazing time with it. I think everything you say is true.
It's just so stylish. It's a bit like with Metroid Dread, just really exciting to see a company throw like this kind of team and resource at this particular genre. Like you can elevate it.
And you're like, you know, Catherine was absolutely obsessed with this game and everyone I know has finished it, like rates it as highly as you do. So yeah, maybe this will be like one I finally conquer over the Christmas holidays.
It really does feel like Metroid Dread unlocked the potential of this game. Like it does some of the same tricks, like pulling the camera in on the character when doing like a mega attack and then seeing like a cool animation up close. Just it feels like it uses the same box of tricks to make it feel blockbuster-y.
Yeah, it's great, man. It's really good and I don't think it's been forgotten from this year because critics really did rate it, but it was right at the start of this year. I think it's literally January this game.
So yeah, in some ways, I think it might have found its audience if it was a Switch 2 exclusive, like at launch, that might have been the way for this to find the audience it deserved. But as a late game Switch experience, it really delivers. So yeah, I love this man.
This will be Â£10 forever now and you owe it to yourself to play it. That's what I think. Okay.
So what's your number 2, Matthew?
My number 2 is Indiana Jones and The Great Circle.
Here it's good.
It is. A tricky one, obviously. You can't talk about it.
I haven't finished this. I'm right in the meat of what feels like the final act of it. But this is just absolutely brilliant.
If you like Indiana Jones, I think the way it understands that character and gives you exactly what you want from that character, not just in video game form, but just full stop after two Indiana Jones films, which I think just missed the mark in various ways. In Crystal Skull and Die of Destiny, that isn't a controversial claim. I genuinely think it's as good a bit of Indiana Jones product as the earlier films.
It sits alongside them. I think the cut scenes in this film and in this game and the storytelling and the performances are just stellar. Troy Baker's Indiana Jones is so good.
It's not justâ¦ There's bits where it's just an amazing impression, but just the general vibe of it and the writing of it in a particular way. He's constantly muttering all his historical learnings under his breath.
He's just full of knowledge and you're just always hearing him when you're playing the game. That's really exciting. I think the actual cutscenes have genuinely in places like the wit and choreography of something that Spielberg made.
That's so hard to do in an actual film, let alone a fucking video game cutscene. There's some choreography where you end up fighting in this little room with the bad Yvoss and just the way this follows that and the kind of slapstick element of it. You know, Spielberg always has an amazing eye for that, that kind of, sort of the consequences escalating and they've just really understood it.
That alone makes it just essential, as someone who likes Indiana Jones. But then you've got like the actual game itself, this first person puzzle stealth fisticuffs game. I've seen some people go, well it doesn't really do any of them brilliantly, but it all kinds of adds up to something more.
And actually I think they all do exactly what they need to do. I think the puzzles are hands off enough that you get to have a little bit of a thrill of solving things. There's a volume of puzzles that suits in Indiana Jones' game.
He is an academic, that's the thing he excels at. Not just the story, but the side missions. They're just stuffed with temples and dungeons and traps and weird devices and giant stone doors that open when you slot things into the right holes.
And that's that God of War thing where there's as much good material off the beaten path as there is on the main central quest line. So just the whole thing feels so rich. But then you have this open world element where you're walking around investigating mysteries, organically picking up the trail of certain things, meeting all these weird and wonderful characters, sneaking to enemy camps, putting on disguises.
People have likened it to Hitman or Immersive Sims, there's certainly some complexity to the environments and freedom of approaches to make your way around them, but it really does feel to me like Riddick, which obviously they did back in the day when when Machine Games was Starbreeze, and just that sense of being in a character's body and being in their world, and you're constantly waiting for it to put a foot wrong and do something to kind of take you out of that world, or that doesn't sound true to it, which is something that happened in the later Spielberg films, I think. But this one, the illusion is just so complete and there's so much of it. I've played it for about 30 hours.
I don't feel like I'm really anywhere near finished with it. Exploring the Vatican, hitting fucking Nazis with frying pans, the natural comedy of deciding what to hit someone with, because you go into rooms and it always reminds me of that scene in Pulp Fiction, where Bruce Willis is in the pawn shop and he's trying to decide, you know, he keeps like one-upping himself and then he ends up with like the samurai sword or whatever. It's kind of like that.
You've got like a frying pan and then you're like, oh no, wait, there's a hammer, I'll pick that up. And then you see like a full sledgehammer and you're like, oh no, I'll pick that up. And then that's the thing that's going into the back of a Nazi skull.
And that's just so good. I hope Machine Games were going to make a good game, but I think this is the best thing they've made by like a long way. So coherent.
A world I love being in. What a treat at the end of the year, like the perfect Christmas game. I know that makes it very awkward for you, Samuel, but it's true.
I think this is fucking brilliant. The best thing Xbox have put out in... I can't think of a last time that there was something this good.
What do I say? Let's think. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
I remember when we were sending out review codes, I told you pre-embargo, like make sure you play this opening before the world gets hold of it, which I think was a good call. Yeah, it's funny, because I've played the opening area and a big part of the Giza area, the area set in Egypt. I played those areas about five times each because I was learning them for a preview of what we did.
In the Giza area, there's so much in that map that every time I played it, I found different stuff each time. I really love the hand animations in this game.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's just so... How much they convey of that character in those hand animations, it's just, yeah.
It's really, yeah, it's really bespoke. You know, and I've seen some people being like, oh, I want it to be in third person. But like, you know, you get to see him...
The bits you do see him in third person are where he's doing, like, the things you probably most want to see in third person. Like, he's swinging across gaps on his whip and he's clambering around, you know, in the cut scenes themselves. Like, I don't feel like you get shortchanged on seeing Indy and being, like, in his body for, like, punching someone.
And, you know, it's one of those sound effects that, you know, it just sounds like the earth cracking into every time you clock someone on the chin. It's just, they've just really nailed it, you know? I think it's like up there for me with, like, Batman Arkham, Spider-Man from Insomniac in terms of, like, these guys really got it and I really hope they make more of it because it's just like, I will definitely have more of this.
I've not even finished it, you know? Depending on how it ends, like, it could have been in the number one spot. That's the kind of fun I'm having with it.
But, yeah, it's, yeah. Oh, it's a good game.
Yeah, those devs deserve it. They're brilliant. Okay, cool.
So I have no idea what your number one is, actually. Why can't I? Is it really obvious and I just can't suss it out?
Maybe. I mean, yeah, it's something I've talked about and liked.
Okay, weird, Lynn. Okay, all right. So my number two then is Balatro.
Balatro is here. An absolute life-wrecking game that happened this year. A true phenomenon, a massive, massive success, a rogue-like, where you play poker hands to score points, to reach like a certain score amount in order to succeed in a level and then progress.
And you collect jokers to amplify the effects of those hands, and then you can level up those hands with different power-ups as well. Absolutely fiendishly addictive, loads of different types of decks you can play with in order to alter the experience, new things to kind of complete, and then like a whole range of challenges to complete too. Sort of like a challenge mode thing that I've, a layer of the game I've not really got into.
But a game so addictive, I had to literally set myself the restriction of only playing it to and from London on the train, giving me two hours a week with it because there were just days I played 10 hours this game. It was just, it will fill as much time as you give it. And it's like one of those games where you explain it to people and they think they won't get it.
They think they'll be like, well, I don't like poker. And like, and it every single time it wins them round. I've never heard anyone say, oh, Balatro is a load of old shit.
I didn't really get what the hype was. I mean, everyone gets it. It's just once you get over that very small hurdle of the poker hands thing, it really like seeps in.
And there's so much character embedded in the music that we talked about last week. The different designs of the jokers, the different jokers you can find as you go. Yeah, the very peculiar vibes of it that are just so winning.
Yeah, I really love this. Just the indie phenomenon of the year and totally deserved. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, everything you said basically. I just, I like this. There's so many routes to success in this.
I feel like, not every hand, but most of what it gives you, if you can kind of recalibrate your thinking, you can probably make a good fist of it. And that to me is the mark of a great, whatever we call this, roguelike, or starting with a fresh set every time. I love the experimentation and coming up with new combinations.
I love that it's not super strict. I'm not saying it's a pushover to win, but I feel like it's kind of happy for you to absolutely trance it and to get a basic combination which just carries you to the sort of finish line and then invites you to have a bit of fun, seeing if you can really rack up a sort of obscene number by getting some extra cards. Yeah, I just love that sensation of getting a particular card where suddenly your tactic for that run sort of locks into place and you're like okay we're going to be doing this you know I'm gonna you know I've got this card so suddenly it all becomes about turning all these cards in or as many of these cards into kings as possible or like we're only playing pairs but we're going to play pet you know these crazy pairs that that escalate and multiply in all these weird ways it's just it's so fun fun this game and I haven't even like I don't feel like I've pushed that deep into I've played loads of it but I'm just happy like you know I you know you can push deeper into the difficulties and there are modifiers which change how the runs behave but I'm generally just very very happy you know seeing what weird combos it comes up with and will the magic happen for me this run and listening to that cool music and I like that it isn't combat I like that it's just a game you know I like that it's like some thing that could have been on windows you know next to Solitaire except it's just really loopy you know I like that it doesn't have to dress it up as anything it's just yeah it's a fucking card game and it's about cards and that's just so clean you know.
I agree I haven't maxed this game out by any means I know some people who have. I yeah I've just been happy to have spent probably 40 hours in its orbit this year. I've bought this game three times already I've bought this game on Steam and then I thought you know what it's good to have it on Steam Deck but it'd be nice to have it on Switch the extra portability factor bought it on Switch and then I was like you know what I don't always want to take my Switch into London but I've got a phone bought it on my phone bought it for my dad on his phone bought him Google Play credits to buy this I really just think it's I just yeah it's that thing of like ah I want every every dad who ever played Windows Solitaire in the 90s should should discover this game and have their lives changed I'd really firmly that's like an ideology I really believe in a very petty ideology a very ridiculous ideology but um yeah Does it make me a pervert that I played this on PS5?
Ah it's a bit strange did you just have the music going in the living room constantly was it driving Catherine mad?
Yeah driving Catherine up the wall.
That is like a form of torment that is I think that's like there's definitely some spousal.
She'd come in and I'd say welcome to Hotel Balatro. I think I've imagined.
Stop trying to make Hotel Balatro happen Matthew.
I'm just saying it's place like a listening and I know that they do. Hotel Balatro.
Yeah it's just great to see this beer deserve success this year. You're like yeah millions of people bought this and it was exactly as good as everyone said it was.
You won't have heard this yet when we're recording this but Jay Bayliss picked this as his Game of the Year for a little segment on last week's episode and made the case for it purely on the basis that it inspired him of like there's still so many games that haven't been made. It's still possible to come up with so many creative ideas. Like no one would have predicted this but you could have made this 20 years ago.
He obviously puts this much better in the soundbite which you'll have heard by now. But I think that's true as well. It's just like how awesome that weird, weird poker rogue like is one of the games of the year.
Yeah. I honestly think like the presentational sort of like upside of this, like the just the fact that it looks like about 25 to 30 percent nicer than any other like basic card game you've seen. It just makes such a huge difference.
Just that extra infusion of character and detail is like, I think that moves the needle massively. It just looks so, so appealing, so much more appealing than a lot of these games tend to, to me. And indeed, it's spied like so many imitators.
Yeah, Jay is right, as ever, he is a great thinker on games. Good stuff. I look forward to hearing that segment, Matthew, in my future, but the listener's past.
Okay, so then that was my number two and your number three, Balatro. So what is your number one, Matthew?
My number one is Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth.
Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is one of the first games I played this year. One of the first games that I really loved this year, got me feeling really excited, feeling like this is going to be an amazing year. This is how good it is in January.
What's it going to be like for the rest of the year? And it's just really stuck with me. And if anything, what happened with me and Metaphor Re-Fantasio made me kind of double down on my affection for it and how much I liked it.
Increasingly in my tastes, I'm beginning to kind of get a bit tired of global threats or challenges that are so big in games that they're kind of unfathomable, all broad depictions of good versus evil. I'm beginning to find that stuff like so unrelatable that it's beginning to become a bit meaningless and it's happening in like the television I'm consuming. Like I basically can't watch the superhero and the Star Wars stuff.
It says nothing to me. But what I love about Infinite Wealth is that it is about very recognisable people and human problems. You know, it's about employment, it's about ageing, it's about illness, how to be a good person, like taking stock of your life, your reputation.
And I'm not saying I see any of myself in these characters, these middle-aged Japanese gangsters, you know, who are kind of ridiculous in lots of ways. But I feel like putting an RPG in that contemporary setting and talking about those things, it just resonated with me way more. Like I'm so much more invested in this group of characters than I am in any other group of characters this year.
I think Ichiban is just such a good dude, and in a year which was really sour and bitter, I just found him just so cheering. This is a guy who's like very rough around the edges, he isn't perfect, he's very believable, but he's also good and he's trying to do good. And you know, famously in this game they also pair him with Kiryu from the older Yakuza games, who in this game is very sick, he's dying.
That's out there, I think, hopefully not a spoiler. And it's about him coming to terms with that, and taking stock of everything he's done in his life, and their different outlooks, and how they help or hinder one another as they're trying to solve. This admittedly quite silly story, if I make this sound too wanky or highfalutin, it is fundamentally another Yakuza game with underground shopping centres and casinos, and a bit where you fight a giant shark.
But I found there was stuff I could get my teeth into in this one. His group of friends are really likable, really relatable. It's like middle-aged Mass Effect, except instead of a spaceship where you hang out with everyone between missions, there are various bars in different cities, whether that's Hawaii, where this game is mainly set, or back in Yokohama, and just going to the bars, hanging out with these very well-written, very well-played characters.
This game was just such a good hang. Maybe it's the perfect game for this year, it's just exactly what I wanted, and I'm just doubly sure of that now. Whereas when I played Metaphor, for example, it was going for something so grand, it was trying to share these ideas about political systems, what can and can't be fantasy, and it's all fine, but it's also sort of meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
I feel like this is a game which wrestles a lot more with things that are true in our lives, compromise and disappointment. But still being a kick-ass, really fun Yakuza game, I do think it's a really special game, weirdly. On top of being the big stupid Yakuza which has an Animal Crossing game and a big Pokemon game and giant sharks and cowboys with rail guns and an attack where loads of poodles eat someone.
It has all that but there's a real heart to it which I really liked.
Yeah, I know it's an absolutely monstrously long, all-encompassing thing.
It might be Stockholm Syndrome again.
But much loved. It certainly feels like this particular like a dragon RPG offshoot has been a resounding success, a bit of a creative pivot that's gone down very well. It's cool that they found a way to extend the story of Kiryu into this.
And I know that the protagonist, Ishibana, has gone down so well. The choice of setting just seems cool. Like I do want to get to these games at some point.
There are now three of them to get through to catch up. But I know they're very, very long, all of them. But yeah, it's cool that this has found an audience and they can keep making them.
And people are not tired out by them despite their length. They just find them very moreish. Like they're watching a TV show or something, and they're willing to just go on that journey with it every single time.
That's probably what it is. It's that kind of long form storytelling. Like you've got such a relationship with the characters that they can take you to places that are like long form TV shows can.
Yeah, that's it. And like I like the idea that those particularly adult themes are what makes this resonate with you as much as the the CitiFund stuff. Yeah.
Yeah. I just wasn't expecting it.
You know, like they advertised it as, you know, it's the Yakuza Hawaiian adventure, you know. And it was just like way more than that, I think. You know, maybe accidentally.
I don't know. It's like a very sincere game.
You excited about the pirate spin off next year, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, that's...
Yeah, it's kind of like, I liked that, that more grounded side of this so much that a little bit of that is like, do I really want Majima doing all that bullshit? You know, like, is that actually where I am now with this series? I mean, it's important that it can be different things.
But spending like half a game with a cancer riddled Kiryu, going back to all your old haunts and having flashbacks to all the scenes from the previous games and like weighing those up and seeing whether you were like a kind of a good influence on it. It's a little bit kind of Christmas carol-y. He's a bit like a kind of ghost of Christmas past.
He's like observing all the characters he's helped over the games. Like to go from that to, I'm a pirate and I've got a ship and we're going to take over the way. It's a little jarring.
Yeah I can see why maybe one side of that coin is more interesting to you than the other. Damn, infinite wealth.
It is. It's the wolf hole of Yakuza games.
Oh dear, that's such a you comparison point. A good fitting number one for you though I think for this year, Matthew.
Yeah, and again, I do feel mean about Astrobot.
Oh well, I think that's like, I think it's like 10% too shitty, I think. It's outside the boundaries of acceptable, sort of like, game of the year behaviour.
Acceptable behaviour?
Acceptable game of the year behaviour on The Back Page. I think you knew that you were sending a statement when you made that decision.
I really wasn't trying to do that. I promise this isn't me playing the Nintendo card. Nintendo disappointed me this year.
This was a bad Nintendo year for me.
Yeah, just Matthew exchanging the existence of theme parks for like one nine out of ten Mario spinoff. You know, that's the kind of thing we're talking about there. Yeah, I'll let the listeners decide.
I'm really curious to see what the response...
Bad. I'll tell you now. The response will be bad.
I think you're going to get... It's going to get a disproportionate amount of chatter relative to the rest of the list, I would say.
And I will say, well, tell me which of my heartfelt 10 picks I should delete for the Astro Blast.
The answer is Mini Shoot Adventures, Matthew.
The answer is Mini Shoot Adventures. You are right.
No, it's your list. You do whatever you like.
I'm telling you, you're going to fucking love Mini Shoot Adventures and then we'll see, you know...
People will love it eventually. Yes. No, you pick whatever you like, man.
It's never stopped me from picking a mod or whatever, you know, just sort of like it throwing or like picking Destiny for the best game. All it did was release an expansion.
That's OK, but I promise I'm not being a shit lord. I promise. I promise.
That's like the Nintendo stamp of approval for Matthew Castle, the I'm not being a shit lord stamp of approval. That is on this podcast.
I promise. Anyway, you're number one.
Yes.
I've kind of forgotten what it's going to be, but.
Well, have you? I mean, I appreciate the K-Fabe.
I'm trying to give it a bit of drama for the listeners.
Yes. So what has happened is that off air, Matthew has accidentally rumbled by number one by going, we didn't talk about X game. And I was like, no, because that's my number one.
He did that right before talking about his number one. So he knows full well that my number one is The Mighty Dragons Dogma 2 from Capcom, the boldest AAA game I played this year, an RPG slash action game of enormous length, but also just so ambitious. Quests that just fucking break because they exist ambiently in the world and are too complicated for the game to always simulate without any problems.
It's a really far reaching and exciting game that is a long awaited sequel to a game that I'm not that familiar with. This was a game I really went on a journey with this year. And my journey in this game is defined by my adventure with Randy Newman, with Barry Chuckle, Ian Dixon from Capcom's Porn, who I summoned in, and my idiot cat pal Douglas, my own creation, who went along with me for this journey.
And it was absolutely wonderful. The scale of this game is amazing. Massive monster fights, that literally the only downside to this game, in my opinion, is the monsters.
Monsters don't have a massive amount of variety. There's only so many of them you can encounter. And you will encounter a lot of giant eagles you will fight in this game.
You'll grab on to them a lot. You will stab them a lot in the same place as you'll have similar types of encounters. But this game is generous in so many ways.
The side quests, I think, are fantastic. If you put the side quests in this game next to those in FF7 Rebirth, it just seems so much bolder and more interesting. Just multiple outcomes sometimes, or just really horrible outcomes sometimes.
You can full on fuck them up and they just disappear and that's it for good. That happens sometimes as well. I think it's just like this lateral look at what an RPG can be.
It's a different take of what an RPG can be. And the weird thing is that it's great at those things, despite the core fiction not being very interesting. It's a very generic fantasy universe and the actual stakes within the universe don't ever feel that important or that meaningful.
But it's a great game at creating stories that lets you create stories by going out there, fighting monsters with this select group of pals that you summoned in and making it feel like you're putting enough of your own stamp on the game and taking enough genuinely original experiences out of it, that it feels uniquely rewarding. The exact mode of RPG is just really spoke to me this year, and on top of that you have all of these different classes that allow you to play the game in these different ways. Some of them are not the most instantly rewarding.
They're like heavier classes where your attacks are very slow. There's the trickster class where you're very fast, it's very exciting. That's because I think the game wants you to feel like one member of a party.
It wants everyone to feel like they're having their moment. Even though they're just your AI companions, they will have their moments in these massive battles. I really love that about it.
But the real magic of this game to me, or the way in which it goes to the next level, is the end game of it, which I won't spoil because I know this is a vast game, and the end game is basically the last 10 to 15 hours of the game. It's out there waiting for you to find. But I will say that what leads to it, what happens to the world as a result of it, what you face in that world, and what the outcome, the ending of that end game is, is some of the best shit I've experienced in a game in like, I don't know, the last 10 years for sure.
It's wonderful, wonderful stuff, it's bold. I thought this was absolutely phenomenal. I just, and also again, that I was like, I was a bit tentative about the start of the year.
I was like, well, I know that people like Dragon Stogma bang on about it and make a big deal about it. And I just think of it as the game that you, where you climb on big monsters and stab them, Shadow of the Colossus style, and call in some little AI mates. And it is those things, but a lot of the ways in which it is thrilling and transgressive is very deep into the game.
You have to go on a long journey with it to get to those real high points, but it's well worth it. So this is no question, this is my number one game of this year, Matthew. Thoughts?
Yeah, I absolutely love this. I mean, maybe I should have put it higher than seven. Like, hearing you talk about it there, I'm like, oh yeah, it's fucking good.
It's so like what I want from a fantasy RPG in terms of scale. Like, it feels big, but it's not like hundreds of hours, you know? It's like a, I don't know, 30 hour campaign, maybe?
Probably? Probably can get through in that time, but I've been at it so long.
Maybe a bit longer than that, but it doesn't feel like unworkable. You know, it isn't, you know, a Skyrim or anything like that in terms of how big the world is. Kind of reminds me of like, it's way bigger and more ambitious than a fable game, but it kind of reminds me a little bit of a fable in that it feels quite kind of handcrafted.
It's like very present action, except here the action system is designed by like, the Devil May Cry team, so all the moves feel fucking brilliant and like the collisions of sword on monster and climbing them up and driving your sword into their skulls, you know, it feels, you know, good like a Capcom game should feel. But you never really have a sense of like, statistics whirring away under the, you know, under the hood, you know, which is something I'm not as big a fan of in other RPGs. And it is a reason I like Fable, which is why I made that comparison.
I just love the pawns. I think the pawns just breathe so much life into this game. You know, the roads are full of like freaks and weirdos that other people have made.
You'll bump into like Kratos or Homer Simpson. They'll talk to you in like a weird medieval voice. They have a surprising amount of personality for like 200 soundbites.
I think it does have a pretty good impression of co-op gaming and running around with a little gang of lads, except one of the lads is Barry Chuckle, one of them is Randy Newman, one of them is whatever overpowered thing you've bought with your currency. It's really special and that end game is Chef's Kiss, totally unexpected, so much effort to keep that a secret. It doesn't feel like it's really out there.
I've never seen it on Twitter or anything.
No, because I think everyone who experiences it is like, oh, you should get to experience this fresh and see what it is. Because that is true. It takes a bit of effort to actually do it, to actually get to it.
A little bit of going through the original ending a few times, but good lord, man. It's everything you could want from, well, what would the real escalation of this game be? It answers that question.
It's wonderful. Yeah, so thrilling. That's the thing.
It would have been a top five game for me anyway, but that just took it that step further. The stakes feel so real in that as well. It's, man, so good.
So, so good.
The run I had at the beginning of the year of Infinite Wealth, Dragon's Dog Mature and Rebirth, that's why I thought it was going to be an unstoppable year. Some of my favorite things were all bunched up then to give that impression.
Yeah, absolutely. It was definitely a lot of long games in a row in that first half of the year. Long, good games that have made our top 10s.
You wouldn't have wanted to have spent a minute less with Randy Newman.
Well, you know, every now and then I would swap out some people, but I would have the fondness for my old party of Barry Chuckles' northern accent, Randy Newman doing his posh Harry Potter boy thing, and my idiot Douglas going, I'm not sure about this cave or whatever the fuck he's talking about. Sounding like Charlie Brooker doing a silly voice. That's what Douglas sounded like.
Yeah, really good. And I talked about it before, but the quest where you can basically let the shock keeper turn his wife and child into sand. And then the dawning realization of him asking, like, where did they go?
And then their deaths. Like, rebirth could never dream of such a thing when it's asking you to go and find some chickens or whatever. It's like, you know what I mean?
It's just that, and that's an outcome I did Matthew, cause I'm a shit. And that's what role playing is and Capcom got it. So yeah, I hope they get to make another one of these.
Honestly, just like 30% more creatures to fight. And I think this might've been a 10 out of 10 for me. Yeah, it was close though.
Well, that's it Matthew, we did it. Two top 10 lists, bloody hell. Shall we?
Only one upset along the way.
Yeah, it was pretty tame in the end.
I thought you might have picked UFO 50. That's why I was surprised about your number one.
Here's the maths I did on UFO 50. I asked myself, was there any one game in UFO 50 I liked more than the 12 or 13 games that were in my contention? And the answer was no, it's a cumulative.
You might say that's bogus maths and you should reward the effort. But I do think that UFO 50 is going to get plenty of acclaim without us. It's going to do fine.
You know what I mean?
It's very much the indie astro bot. It's allowed if it's not there.
I like you. I had the same question of, did I get my arms around this truly? And I wasn't quite sure I did.
So it had, it was like floating around six, seven, eight, nine for a little while there, you know?
Yeah. I had some other things that like, basically when astro bot couldn't make the top ten, it formed out certain other things.
Right.
You know, like there was a moment where like, Rise of the Ronin was in there and I was like, I can't do that. I said, they'll literally kill me if I did that. That's like unacceptable behavior.
Yeah.
Anyway.
That's funny. I like that. The rules of, yeah, the unspoken rules of the top ten.
There are, you can't cause a discord civil war with the top ten.
But I do engage with the whole of the lists. We've talked about a lot of great games this year.
We have. Those are two strong top tens and as ever, I'll tell you, they're like 50 percent the same and 50 percent different. I'll tell you something, that's kind of like the, that's sort of the, there's a Venn diagram that forms this podcast.
We're not violently opposed on it. Even if it's not for you, there's no disrespect.
No, I think this is a very respectful.
There's no disrespect, right?
There's no disrespect. This is a very gentle diplomatic podcast. Okay, let's recap our top 10s, Matthew, because I think that would be handy for the listeners to have.
Also, I'm not writing it down for them, so they can just have it here. That's the most, I'm done with podcast admin for the year, I'm afraid. So that's it.
But I will try again in 2025, I promise. Matthew, what is your number 10?
Mini Shoots Adventures.
I picked mouth washing. What's your number 9?
No Case Should Remain Unsolved.
Helldivers 2, number 8?
Xeno Tilt, Hostile Pinball Action.
Still Wakes the Deep. Number 7?
Dragon's Dogma 2.
Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Number 6?
Animal Well.
Space Marine 2. Number 5?
Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
Silent Hill 2 Remake. Number 4?
Rise of the Golden Idol.
Astrobot. Number 3?
Balatro.
Balatro. Balatro. Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown.
Number 2?
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
Balatro. Number 1?
Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth.
Dragon's Dogma 2. Two games with dragon in the title. Computer Games.
Good year for dragons.
Computer Games. We did it. Well, I hope people enjoyed that podcast.
It was quite undertaking. I reckon this is probably the biggest project of my year, even more so than the games that I launched this year in my PR career. It's just like a massive undertaking.
But we always try and treat it really seriously. I think that's a really strong set of picks right there, Matthew. I think we did the listeners proud.
I hope so anyway. That completes the regular Back Page pod feed for this year. We'll be back in January with our 2025 Predictions episode.
Always a fun bluff, some steam kind of episode, that one. For Patreon subscribers, however, there is an extra podcast for the end of this year, The Best TV Shows and Films that we saw this year. Looking forward to talking about that, Matthew.
That drops right at the end of the year. I think it's on New Year's Eve that will land around then. So look forward to that.
And yeah, patreon.com/backpagepod, if you'd like to support us generally. There's a Â£1 tip jar tier. There's also the Â£4.50 XL tier for the two extra podcasts that we make every month.
And yep, you can look forward to our Two Giant Men Play Bully Scholarship Edition in January. There's always more pods. Matthew, have a great Christmas.
This was fun.
You too.
Yeah, and catch you later. Bye bye. Goodbye.
