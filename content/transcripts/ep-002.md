Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm your host, Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
How are you doing today, Matthew?
I am very good. I've just emerged from a 30-hour session with Immortals, where I've been chopping up Greek mythological monsters. So this is a very pleasant break from that.
How are you doing, Sam?
Yeah, I'm not too bad. It's, I'm in the throes of Black Friday, which will date this podcast horribly if someone discovers the episode, like say six months down the line. So I'll avoid any more, avoid any more topical references.
Yeah, I'm playing Doom Eternal at the moment. I feel that's a fairly timeless thing to be playing. Whereas Immortal seems like something that people might forget in a few months.
Yeah, I think so, ironically, given the name. Well, actually, they're both Eternals and Mortals. It's all a bit similar.
I saw your tweet last night saying that you shouldn't be playing Doom Eternal past 11 PM with your old man eyes.
Yeah, I feel like you can't quite keep up with the action. I feel like I'm about 80% at the right speed for it after 11 o'clock, and I can barely manage it during waking hours, so yeah, that's my experience with that phenomenal first-person shooter with lots of good secrets, a little mini review for you there. Speaking of reviews, Matthew.
Nicely done.
Yeah, I kind of. When we started this podcast, like me and Matthew, we have a background in print media, working in games. This isn't to say that we think that we're like the golden generation or something when it comes to like criticism.
But we did work in games media for a long time and feel like there's a contingent of people who follow us on Twitter, I guess, who are kind of like, we're into that stuff. So we thought that talking about some of those experiences in podcasts might be good while also kind of connecting it to more modern day stuff. Made no effort to do that this week because this week it's all about game reviews, the process of reviewing games and scores we got wrong, which is a juicy subject and not just wrong in like the sort of we overscored a game but also underscored a game and yeah, lots of variations.
So what's going to happen is we're going to talk a bit about reviewing games and what that's like. And then we're going to go into each of us are going to talk about games that we reviewed that we felt like we got wrong and we'll kind of alternate and there's a lot of soul searching with this one. Yeah.
And like we go quite far back in time as well. So like, hopefully, you know about games from a decade ago. If not, a lot of that might be quite the skill, but I think we talk about some pretty mainstream stuff.
So yeah, we good. So yeah, Matthew, talk to me about reviewing games and when you first started on working on NGamer, what was what was it like to review a game for the first time to you?
Kind of nightmarish, to be honest, because of the very specific case, the first game I ever reviewed was Red Steel on the Wii, the notorious Red Steel, which was just a perfect storm of nightmarish factors in that it was, I'm pretty sure, the first ever Wii review anywhere in the world. The first one printed, wow. It was my first review for a magazine, the first review in this new job that I'd only had for about a month, and it was my first trip away with the magazine.
I went over to Paris to play it. So there was a lot of unknown elements, and it was a new console that we didn't really know how it was going to behave, which, as you can probably imagine, any one of those things is kind of horrible and a bit of an obstacle to get over. Weirdly, like, now in hindsight, I don't know if you'll agree with this, but the thing I hate the most is having to review from an event, mainly because I'm not...
I mean, talk a bit about our individual review processes, but I'm not very good at making notes, and I tend to sort of submerge myself in something and kind of write alongside it, which you don't do in an event. You have like two days to basically mine it for every opinion you're ever going to have or you're ever going to have in a magazine and then move on. And that was like my first ever taste of that.
So this was, take us back, this was like late 2006, right?
Yeah. Yeah, this was, yeah, this would have been, I think I played it early November. It was right at dead, it was right on deadline.
I remember it was really, really tight. I had to write it over the weekend. I went out there for two days to Paris, Ubisoft Paris Studios, which is quite far from the, like the massive kind of, when you see pictures of these big glamorous sort of, you know, they're huge sort of Canadian studios they have.
This is quite far from that. It's a lot smaller. I had no idea what I was doing really.
And you know, sitting in a room, I mean, you've probably done a lot more of these sort of review visits than I have, I think, over the years, because we didn't really do a lot of them with Nintendo games, but just having to sit in a room by yourself with the people who made the game, like looking through windows and stuff, it is...
That sucks, yeah. I did a few review events. They feel like they've gone away a little bit, although I think you still try...
People... Publishers still try and do them for multiplayer shooters. Obviously, in a pandemic, you can't do it the same way.
And I think that's actually been quite good for getting review code early this year. Like, I've noticed outlets have had review code a lot earlier than they might normally have, which seems better to me than doing review events. But it's also like, the specific circumstances of a review event, I found they always made me hate the game more.
Because I thought, well, I can't just go and have a drink of water anywhere and wander around. I'm like, all I can do is like, take a small break and then go back to this computer in this dark room and stare at the screen. And so yeah.
It's weird though, because I think sometimes, I think what they're probably hoping for is that there's some weird alchemy in the room and everyone gets like high on the game and then their excitement fuels each other. And that's where you get these massive obscene scores from, you know, because often they're over a couple of days and you have evenings together with other journals. Like I tend to be, you know, left to my own devices, quite kind of keep myself to myself.
I don't really talk with other people when I'm reviewing games in my own time or at home or in the office. But at those events you just find that there's a bit more kind of stuff moving between everyone and they, you know, on the multiplayer thing that you mentioned, I actually find it sometimes does help as well because the best a journalist is ever going to be at any shooting game is playing against other shit journalists. So everyone comes out thinking, well, actually, this is the battlefield that makes me okay at battlefield.
And it's like, no, it's just that the general public who are good haven't come in yet to kick your arse.
Hey, I'll have you know, I am moderately good at Apex Legends until I get sorted into a bracket with players I can't beat and then I have to stop playing it after I've had a tantrum. But yeah, the review thing is weird as well because I don't know about you, but no one really taught me how to review games. There was a review template when I joined Play Magazine.
Here's a big difference between you and me, right? Like you're on NGamer, part of the N64 magazine, Superplay?
NGC as well.
NGC Legacy, right? I was on PlayStation Magazine that was independent, quite irreverent, a bit laddish, I suppose. I don't think it was loved in the same way that your magazines were.
Your magazines are still... I see people collecting your old magazines and talking about them on Twitter and stuff. Whereas Play, I don't think the world noticed that Play vanished, even though Play sold more copies than NGamer did by quite a long way, which I think is quite interesting actually.
I think that speaks to Nintendo audiences versus PlayStation audiences, first of all. But also I think that... I don't know, I just think there was a slightly better editorial going on in NGamer at the time.
I think on Play, the thing I remember we had, we had a review template and in it, it just said, avoid cliches like, war, what is it good for when you're talking about a first person shooter with war? That was kind of... I don't remember anyone else telling me, oh, this is how you review a game or whatever.
Maybe it was different for you, I don't know.
No, not really. I mean, like, I guess we had all those years of the magazine that you, if you'd read them, you kind of just had a feel for what the mag wanted. In definitely terms of voice, you know, it was, it was quite personal, quite silly, weirdly, like we always wrote in the plural, though.
So even though it was quite personal, you'd put all this weird personal stuff in, but it was always like, we, that always threw me. You know, there's reviews that refer to like, our uncle, as if people got the same uncle and he did something, which is preposterous, but lends its own charm. I still feel much more comfortable not writing with I.
Obviously, we did that too, and it made no sense. Yeah, being on PC Gamer was the first time I could actually write in first person.
Do you like it?
Yeah, I do, because now I understand how to do it. I didn't for a few years when I was on PC Gamer. I felt like I was writing blog entries in the magazine, but then I kind of got used to when and when you don't say I and relate a specific experience that you're having.
But it's definitely like a weird one, a weird old quirk of magazines for sure.
Yeah, because I remember I don't think my early stuff, my early years, is particularly great. Like when I go back there, I think it was in the right spirit of the thing and people seem to stomach it. But it was a little bit try hard.
But I remember when I wrote the Red Steel review, and then the greener, it was probably like it was my first review. So this kind of makes sense. But it's probably my most edited piece of work in terms of like the amount of feedback I got.
That was basically like they use that one review to kind of hammer me with lots of stuff. I mean, I think the problem, not a problem I used to have, but like I may be back then lent more naturally towards like an edge like style. That was always the note I used to get from greener who is Mark Green, who is the editor sort of legendary Nintendo magazine figure.
And yeah, he'd always be like, oh, this is getting a bit edgy. You know, it's not edgy as in edge magazine, not as in, you know.
Well, you're well known for your edgy personality.
Yeah, exactly. So you know, there's nothing wrong with edge magazine, but it was a very different tone. And the thing they always came back to was like, oh, imagine you're telling your friend in the pub why this thing is good.
And that was basically the guy. That one line is the guide. And if people ask me, that's probably the thing I recycle now and tell them is also, it's like you're trying to entertain your friend in the pub or tell them about this thing, tell them what they think, you know, you know what they like.
You know what a general Nintendo fan likes. Kind of give them that. And I've kind of stuck with that ever since.
Do you think your like review style or review voice has changed massively over the years?
Yeah, I think I'm now really confident in calling the shots on games where I've played so many hours of them. I just know exactly what I'm doing. So, the last game I did a big review on before I left PC Gamer in 2019 was The Division 2.
And I played like 50 hours of it. And I felt really comfortable making calls about what was good and what was bad without feeling like I needed to kind of create a sort of structure for the review or make sure I'm ticking off specific things like talk about the graphics or whatever, which I think is a bit more, you're a bit more like partitioning off sections like that when you're first, when I was first starting out, that's how I found it. I was like, oh, I better make sure I talk about the soundtrack and I better make sure I talk about how long it is and the graphics because that's very much like an old kind of 90s mag style of doing things.
You still get that bit, but now I feel like I can talk about it, talk about games in a slightly more experiential way, not kind of like that kind of new games journalism, like you're reading a diary feature thing, but just find it easy to make, you know, to critique a game and then connect it back to a specific experience I had playing it, you know. That's how I feel like my style has changed. How about you?
Yeah, I think, likewise, and there's definitely a confidence over, you know, been doing this for about 14 years now and, you know, I'm quite sure of my opinions when I'm playing a game. Like I can form, the review forms quite naturally in my head as I'm playing things, which helps. Yeah, I think the big thing I shook was just, there was a lot of try hard stuff early on, you know, I was trying to be like, hilarious and zany and NGamer was a funny mag, but it wasn't a cynical mag, you know, and I think a lot of the funny games writing, when people think of funny games writing, they maybe think of like PC Zone, the kind of Charlie Brooker type stuff.
I'm not very good at that. Like I'm not a caustic funny writer. I'm quite bad at bootings.
But I think it can, so I've sort of settled more comfortably into just being trying to be kind of good humid about something. I wrote a review of Hotel Dusk, the DS sort of Twin Peaks-y motel set adventure. And I wrote it as a like a detective novel, and it is probably the worst thing you will ever read.
And I can't, I just can't even look at it.
I can top that. It wasn't in a review, right, but when I wrote a cover feature on GTA IV, I wrote a diary from the perspective of Nico Bellic, the main character of the game, as a box out. And like, it was the most, it's like, I mean, it's a piece of fan fiction.
But like, I think my editor at the time suggested it, but I read it back and it was so embarrassing. I mean, people are a bit harsher rock stars writing, but like, I mean, you can definitely tell the difference between my copy and theirs, I would say.
Today I killed my brother.
I think it's just kind of like, it was kind of like Travis Bickle kind of like, chuntering to himself about how the American Dream betrayed him. Yeah.
Well, my hotel dusting didn't seem that bad. The thing that makes me laugh was that our production editor, which people who don't know magazines, that's the person like, all your copy goes through and they basically get it on the page and they fix it and they basically make you into the good writer that you seem on the page. They must have thought it was just total dog shit, that review, but they just humored me and everyone was nice and polite, but it was just, I don't know, I was a real fanboy for N64 and NGC and they didn't do anything like that.
So I don't really know where it came from, but I was just desperate to leave my mark because I felt like there were writers who did and there were writers who didn't. And the legacy of the mag really tripped me up many, many times. I became really hung up on it in a way that I just don't think anyone else was.
Yeah, it took me a while. It wasn't until, see, I never really had the legacy problem because I don't think I worked on any magazine that was truly loved until arguably Sci-Fi Now that had quite a nice little audience in 2010. I worked on that, but then also Games TM which Games TM definitely had an audience that appreciated it.
So I didn't feel the kind of weight of it so much on play because I knew, I mean, I actually thought the writing and play was really good at the time, but like, I think that it wasn't something I couldn't do. It felt like I was like 18 when I started working there and I just felt, oh yeah, writing about PS2 games, being irreverent, that is like my dream job right now at 18. So it was fine.
But what I lacked was someone to come in and say, your sentences are too fucking long, and you know, you should stop using semicolons and all that stuff. That didn't really happen until I was on PC Gamer many years later. I had like a few good mentors when I was working on those earlier mags, but not for that specific meat and potato stuff.
And I think that that's definitely like a kind of future difference, as future production editors are just very like, we're here to teach you the craft as well as like fixing your shit, you know?
Yeah, yeah, I had some great ones. Chrissy Williams was the first prod head on NGamer for about a year and a bit. And then afterwards, it was Charlotte Martin who went on to edit NGamer towards the end.
And yeah, Charlotte, Charlotte and both of them were absolutely brilliant. Charlotte was like super into the mag as it was as well. And by that point, I think my writing was so prevalent in the magazine or whatever that it sort of felt a little bit like almost was sort of in house style.
Yeah, the weird thing was always writing for other mags, like writing for Edge or writing for Games Master. Games Master is quite close to NGamer actually. I often think as a side note, Games Master is slightly maligned in an unfair way.
Because actually, the writing in that was really funny and sparky and it was a lot about games. But I think people had this perception of it being this like kiddyish thing or the connection to the TV show. I don't know, but I actually hold it in quite high regard.
Same. I read it a lot when I was about 13, 14. I read Games Master pretty much every month and thought the writing was really strong because it was the same writers from the other future mags.
That's what I didn't realize because I used to read it and I had to meet the team page and there are about 25 people on it. And in my head, that was a magazine written by 25 people as a huge team. I was like, man, they must have so much fun writing that mag.
And it didn't even occur to me that half the people were permanent staff on other mags I also read. And it didn't even compute that, oh, wait a second, this might not be true.
So the other thing I wanted to ask about on their reviews was scoring games. So obviously the kind of process is one thing, but the actual score. Scores have become weirdly contentious in recent years, and I think that's just because people on the internet take things way too seriously.
But I think that I really like scores as a kind of metric, but also it's an entertaining factor of a review. How did you find the process of assigning a score to a game?
Yeah, I think I'm like you, I do like scores. I like the sense of context they create at the end, even though so many games aren't like for like and can't really be compared. I like the idea that you are compiling this huge scale and it becomes about like slotting games into that, which is where, and that is actually where a lot of my scoring comes from.
I felt like, oh, it was kind of like that, but better, or it wasn't quite as good as that. And so the score would reflect that. I really was reacting.
I wasn't just pulling them out of my arse, which I think some people do do. And it only really works if everyone's on board and kind of respects the kind of sanctity of everyone else's scores. Because we often have, I mean, we never argued about scores on NGamer because, you know, we're fundamentally mates and there were bigger things to argue about constantly.
But there was, there were definitely times I felt like, oh man, you really like overscored or underscored that and it's put everything out of whack or, you know, this thing is definitely not as good as this thing I've played, but you've scored it higher and do I have to now have to go higher to like match that? There was a bit of weird sort of back and forth in that sense. But fundamentally, I like them.
I like a big, I like 100% score as well, rather than out of 10. I like the nuance of what's the difference between a 73 and a 74.
Yeah, I think it definitely varies per outlet. Obviously, like an edge 10 out of 10 means a lot in the context of that magazine. But I loved seeing on PC Gamer that Half-Life, the original Half-Life got like 96%.
But the Deus Ex, I think, got 94 or 95.
Yeah.
And I like that difference. It's just, it was, yeah, like you say, I always thought about that. When I reviewed GTA IV, I was scoring it in the context of a magazine that had given San Andreas 98% and Suffice City 96%.
So in my head, I'm like, well, what is the slot in that kind of like bracket? And, you know, it could be quite a complicated process. But yeah.
So, Matthew, we're going to move on to talking about the game review scores we got wrong. And so I think, like...
Are they all wrong, wrong or some of them questionable?
Yeah, I think that there is, I could, when I looked at mine again, I thought there are no outright howlers there. There were just like a few right, I kind of got it wrong by a few degrees, or the process threw me off, or something just went a bit amiss, or I just didn't quite get a game, which happened a few times. Yours, I think, are much more interesting.
Obviously, like, you've already kind of mentioned Red Steel, so I won't go into that too much. But I think process is a big part of it. Like, a lot of mine are from earlier in my career, because I didn't really understand what I was doing for about...
It's like this idea of some idiot with a head full of numbers just throwing them at a game and hoping for the best. I don't know what I'm doing with these words and numbers!
I think I was just a terrible writer, but people were very nice to be imagined and told me I was good, and I think that kind of filled me with a bit of natural confidence. But it took until about 2009 for me to... for the promise to kind of shine through a little bit.
But, yeah, whereas I've seen some of your earlier reviews, and I think they're very good, but I mean, like you say, it could be just a mix of having such great prods and etc.
Yeah, definitely. They got rid of all the crap.
So yeah, I guess I'll start with one of mine then, Matthew, unless there's anything else you want to add about the review process.
No, no, no. I'm sure we can fold anything else in.
Yeah. Cool. All right.
So my first one was 2007's The Darkness on PS3, which I gave 91%. So I don't know if you remember this game. It was from Starbreeze.
Back when Starbreeze was mainly composed of the machine games people who now make the Wolfenstein games. And it was my first big review. It came out in 2007, and I had to go to 2K's offices to review it, which itself was quite intense.
I remember feeling like, oh, this is very intense. I was like, just turned 19. I thought, oh, this is very intense doing this.
I'm away from home reviewing a computer game. And I think I kind of overscored it just on that basis, really, where I just thought, OK, this feels like a big deal. And first of all, it is a good game, for sure.
It's like a kind of weird first-person shooter, sort of like gangster game hybrid, with some World War I elements in them. It's based on basically a shitty comic book from the 90s. It's one of the original Image Comics, which were obviously huge selling, but mostly built around the art first.
And people have come around on some of them. But I maintain they're not amazing comics. So they kind of retrofit this weird mythology into this first-person shooter.
I think I got it wrong, because the 360 version was a lot better than the PS3 one. The PS3 one had hideous loading times. I'm not sure I even mentioned the memoir review.
And I definitely should have done, because every time you walk from a subway into a street, it would load, and you'd have to watch the main character just sitting around.
Did he say he didn't like monologue?
No, he just sort of looked at his guns and sort of looked into space, sat on a chair. And like, there's so much of it spent doing that. And it also looked a bit weird on PS3.
It didn't look as good as it did on 360. But I think I was like, I just thought it was such an interesting game at the time. I think I just got it slightly wrong.
I think I got it wrong by about 15%. That probably should have been like a 75, 76 kind of review.
Yeah, I enjoyed it. I have a weird memory of the darkness, because I went on my first ever American press trip was a 2K thing where I went to see Fantastic Four on the Wii. And everyone else on that trip was seeing the darkness.
Which at the previous stage, that's when that game's maybe at its best, because it seems very glossy. It's got a lot of exciting stuff. For an hour, it's quite intense and flashy.
And they were all like, oh my god! They weren't American, they were Brits who were with me. Everyone was talking about how good the darkness was.
And I'd just seen the ropeiest 4 out of 10, Fantastic Four, I think it was Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer tie-in. And it was just miserable. So the darkness always seemed very exotic to me for that reason.
Yeah, that sums up the gulf between the Wii and other consoles at that time in terms of software, doesn't it?
Yeah, one you get to pull people's hearts out with like a demon tentacle and the other one you're like looking at a blurry thing that might be Michael Chiklis as the thing. You're like, is that Chiklis?
Or is that something on my screen?
Or is it Dean Norris? Is that some of the yoghurt on our CRT rub screen?
I'm glad that my story about this game yielded a much better anecdote from you. Let's move on to one of yours. You might as well introduce this one because I don't think this is public knowledge until now.
It might be public knowledge.
It's not that big a deal.
I reviewed Zelda Skyward Sword. I did it for NGamer but I also did it for Edge where I gave it a 10. I gave one of the fabled Edge 10s.
Which is a weird thing. I'd seen an Edge 10 from afar. I talk about it with some reverence because if you know Edge magazine you'll know they haven't given many 10s to the point that when they do it's kind of an event.
It's treated as such internally as well. I remember when they were giving, in the run up to giving Mario Galaxy a 10, there was some kind of buzz of excitement. I remember Tony, not the editor, coming over to Mark Green to basically sense check it.
And that's how you could tell something big was coming down the pipes. It's when they go and talk to other people who've played it to sort of, you know, what do you think? It's almost like it has to pass all these secret tests.
Weirdly, when I reviewed it, I wrote the review. I didn't actually score it. This is how I remember it anyway.
I didn't actually score it because I think I was sort of leaning towards a nine. And, you know, I wrote this review, which I'm really proud of, and it remains one of the things, like one of my favourite things I've ever written. And, you know, more so than the NGamer review, I think.
And it, like, it does read like a ten. So I can sort of understand. I think they wrote, raised it with me as a point saying, oh, do you think, you know, do you think this is actually a ten?
Because you seem to really, really like it, and I did really like it. And it ticked a lot of my boxes. In hindsight, I don't know if I'd take it back.
I think every word of that review is how I feel about the game, and it's true. But I think maybe there's like a universality to an edge ten, which Skyward Sword doesn't satisfy.
So what are the other tens apart from Mario Galaxy? Is Bayonetta one of them?
Yeah, Bayonetta.
Obviously a rich Stanton one. I don't know if he's ever confirmed that, but you can tell just from reading it though. Stanton wrote that.
Bayonetta, LittleBigPlanet 1.
I don't think that's quite stood the test of time.
I think they gave one to Rock Band.
Well, I could see that. Rock Band was like a culturally significant moment.
Yeah. Did Breath of the Wild.
Nice.
Which I think they had to after I came. You couldn't give that a nine.
You've ruined Zelda.
That would literally be like, you know, a bunch of folks outside Future Publishing Bath.
You've ruined Zelda now for every generation of edge writer.
Yeah. It's... The thing I just go with Sword is it ticks a lot of my personal...
But there's stuff it does that I really like and like stuff it doesn't do that I don't care as much about. You know, a lot of people basically like it. There's no overworld in that game.
And it's just a load of done. It's just a load like a constant puzzle dungeon content and they hate the motion controls. At that point, I'd done, you know, whatever, five, six years on a Wii magazine.
I knew what good and bad motion controls were. I felt really, really confident on that. I know lots of people are like, well, they just don't work, which I just...
it just isn't true.
Well, with the... especially with the Wii Motion Plus, like if you play Wii Sports Resort and stuff, you could really see the difference.
That's the thing. And to me, it felt like a bit of a full stop on Wii in that. I genuinely felt like I could see all the through lines of stuff they'd been trying out elsewhere, how it culminated in this.
And this was really their, like, absolute best case as a complete game that tries to sell you on motion controls. And I'd been in the motion controls trenches for all that time and felt like, yes, that should be celebrated. Lots of people just dismiss it out of hand just because it has motion controls.
They're like, oh, I hope they re-release it without them. And it's like, I think you'd find it a much blander game because it is really built around those.
I think it's good because you sound to me like you are still pretty certain that that's a 10 out of 10.
Well, maybe this is, I say this is a score I got wrong. This is a score, I think if you put all my scores in front of a panel of people, this is the one they'd say, that's wrong. And a lot of people, a lot of peers have told me it's wrong without knowing that I wrote it.
And they're like, well, what a joke. Hilariously, I wrote it. And one of my predecessors on N64 and NGC wrote me an email saying, like, that I absolutely, you know, love that review.
That's, that's like, that is a genuinely, it sounds like I can bigger myself up, but it was like one of my kind of Nintendo writing heroes reached out to say, I love that. You know, this review was so, you know, this, this, you know, you've really, really, you know, kind of nailed this or, or you've, you know, you should be really, really proud of this. And then when they actually played the game, they fucking hated it.
And they're like, wow, you completely oversold that.
Did that hurt at the time? Did that hurt at the time?
No, no, not really, because it took it in good humor. Like the thing they like, they said you made your character, they like the writing and it was something I was going to mention was part of that legacy thing I was talking about working on the Nintendo mags, like N64 and NGC were quite famous for like legendary reviews of the big games like Ocarina of Time, Mario 64. Those are the reviews that are still talked about by the fans of those mags.
And I was so desperate to write one of those. And I don't think I ever did while on Endgamer, but I think that Edge review like is my version of that. It's the time I was like, that is it.
That's the one. So I'm really proud of it. But, you know, if you hate it, don't like farb on my house or something.
It's fine.
No, I think like I've always really like the way Edge scores games. And I think they've kind of that process has been pretty consistent over the years and like has yielded a lot of like really good calls.
So yeah, I love that it's still anonymous. I think that's really, really important.
Yeah, I completely agree.
I feel slightly tacky just saying I wrote that review because there's loads of stuff I've written in Edge that I would never put my name to even though I'm really proud of it. But I just feel like the mystery of the magazine is kind of important to uphold.
Absolutely. Yeah. So yeah, good.
Thank you for that glimpse behind the curtain.
Your next one I see on the list. This is a biggie. I'm interested about this one.
Yeah. So next one, 2008 Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots. I gave that 92% for Plane Magazine at the time.
And that was very much informed by my score for The Darkness, because the highest score I'd given at the time was 91%. And I thought, I can't give the fourth Metal Gear game less than that. So that was a stupid, arbitrary bit of the process.
I think that score seemed fine at the time, but I don't think this game has stood the test of time at all. And there were some reviewers at the time, including Edge, actually, who gave it like 8. I think Eurogamer gave it an 8.
So did Games TM, and they were correct. 8 was like the right score at the time. But I think we talked about this a bit on the last episode, but when you're on a kind of single format mag, it sometimes feels like you're doing a bit of double duty of like being a cheerleader for the platform, and as well as being like a critic.
So in this case, I think that kind of played a part. Also, this was a really weird review event. I think this is a fairly famous review event, but this was like a Paris event where we played in the Grand Hotel in this giant basement, and Kojima was there, Hideo Kojima, the game's director and the creator of the series, and he was kind of wandering around watching people play, which felt like I was in some kind of weird experiment.
I was just saying like, smells like a 10 and things like that near you to try and influence you.
It was a bit awkward because there's a whole bit in that game where you have to inject the character vamp, I don't know if people remember this, with like a syringe, and loads of us hadn't figured out how to do that. And so we were all stuck on the same section because Kojima was walking around and it felt a bit awkward. And also the other thing is the review restrictions for that game were just stupid.
Like it was really a long list. I don't think you could talk about anything past a certain chapter. Right.
Story wise, it basically made it very hard to call out the game for having those terrible long cut scenes. And that was a real kind of like, I think a real kind of example of why review events don't work. It would have been much better to just have the game in our Bournemouth office and play it.
But yeah, it was just, that was it was a weirdly intense process. I interviewed Kashima at that event too. And I wonder if that was swimming through my brain a bit of, oh, wow.
Like a year before, or like a year and a half before I was walking around my hometown listening to Hideo Kashima Productions podcasts about this game and about his games. And now I'm in Paris playing the new one before anyone else. And the creator of the game is right there.
And I'm like, and I was 19 at the time. So I can't help but feel like maybe that was playing a bit of a part. Yeah, that's it's weirdly intense, you know.
Yeah, it's a weird one over because I feel that, you know, that's that it's almost a game that you don't need to score. Like it is sort of an essential PlayStation experience.
Yeah, you did need to play at the time. That's the thing. So it's not like I kind of eats away at me that one.
But I just think the game's cutscenes are just it is an unpermissibly like bad game in terms of how it how it wastes your time. It just thinks it's OK to have like hours of it's got like probably about three or four hours of cutscenes total in that game. And a lot of them are quite bad.
It's which it was very different experience from playing Metal Gear Solid 3, which is largely considered the best in the series, well, minus five in terms of gameplay. But in terms of story, three is considered the best. And I think that four is the opposite of that in a lot of ways.
It's not it doesn't kind of cut things out where it could cut things out. And it's overburdened with law, whereas three stripped it all back.
It's got that really weird bit where you walk around Amsterdam or wherever it is.
Yeah, that section doesn't work at all. That's the other thing is it's not really a good game to go back to. If you pick it up, it doesn't really it's not Gears of War quality as a third person shooter, like not even close.
It's not really an interesting stealth game. There's nothing interesting about the stealth or you blend into environments. Your invisibility suit takes on the color of the textures.
But I never really saw a practical application of why that was interesting in terms of stealth gameplay, whereas I think five has got lots of really good stealth systems. And so I don't think that holds up. I think people would mainly remember it now for the Shadow Moses section, where you go back to the original Metal Gear Solid setting.
But even that's quite, it's just a worse version of playing Metal Gear Solid 1, because you're not doing anything as interesting. All the enemies are gone. There's just these little robots around.
And you fight a boss in the same place you fought Sniper Wolf, and it's not as good as it was in Metal Gear Solid 1. So I think that if I scored this now, I'd probably give it like a 7 out of 10. It's one of those things you should play if you're a Metal Gear fan.
But it was a real pre-recession game, I think, and that review event was a very pre-recession review event as well. It's like we've got all the money in the universe for these ridiculous live action sections at the start of the game and these tie-ins with iPod and Playboy and all this stuff. And so, yeah, I don't think that stands the test of time.
I think I was wrong about that one.
Post-recession, it's all tie-ins with sausage rolls and Greggs and things like that.
I feel like 5 is a very post-recession game in terms of how stripped back it is. It's kind of like, this is just a game. There aren't even that many cutscenes.
And apart from the licensed music, there's not really much in the way of frivolous details.
Ten minutes of Keith Sutherland as a snake.
That's all we could afford was a day of Keith Sutherland's time. So, yeah, that was my second choice. So do you want to talk about your next one, Matthew?
Yeah, so I said Mario Kart Wii, which I gave 88% on NGamer. And Mario Kart Wii went on to be a massive getaway. I think it's one of those sort of sold 20 million copies or whatever.
You know, this was at the height of the Wii's mad power. But it is a game in a series I love, but I have no love for this particular game. And I literally look back at this score as I do some of the later ones.
I just have no idea where it came from, this 88. This was a proper nightmare review event. This was one day with Mario Kart Wii in Nintendo.
I think it was like Nintendo's like Frankfurt offices or something.
They got rid of the tree house at this point.
No, nothing as juicy as that. This was just like one of their Nintendo of Europe offices, which are literally just like marketing offices. We went there, played through the campaign, played a few rounds of the various battle things, played like, I think it was like set up to mimic the online, like it wasn't live because the game wasn't out.
And I never thought it was right as a Mario Kart. Like I just, but it felt this was a very rare case where I felt like that just wasn't a review people wanted to hear or it just wasn't what the spirit of, you know, the spirit of forgiveness, it maybe deserved forgiving because it was in NGamer. If I'd reviewed it for someone else, I wouldn't have been so forgiving.
Like it had all the classic stuff, but like I fundamentally think it's really bloated, as in it had 12 races on each track and they're really wide. Like there's just no shape to any of it. It's a really shapeless Mario Kart, I think.
But people loved it because I think because of the online and because of the time trial stuff, but I just, I had no joy from the core of it. So it didn't matter like how many different ways they were of playing that core. It fundamentally didn't work for me.
I hated the bikes. I thought it just looked crap. And I think Nintendo secretly know this because after Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart got fucking amazing.
There was the Mario Kart 3DS, the 7, that was amazing. There was the Mario Kart in the Wii, Mario Kart 8, which is just like... The best.
That game is magic. It is a spectacular. It is a like, pardon the tacky term, it's like a AAA Mario Kart.
It's everything you want from it. And it makes Wii just look like total amateur hour. I really hate...
We never played it in the office, Mario Kart Wii, which was a sign that it was bust. As a local multiplayer game, it was totally bust because it was so designed for the loads of cars in online. That one I really regret.
I don't think anyone would question that score. No one wrote in going like, you've scored it too low or too high, but in my head, I'm like... In my heart, anyway, that game is not an 88%.
It's like a 6.
I think you were... I kind of get where you're coming from, and I agree with the principle there, but I think you had a tricky thing to do in those days of the Wii where Nintendo weren't really making as many of those kinds of games it was well known for on the GameCube or the N64 or the SNES because they were making these more mainstream-friendly versions of existing series. Now, obviously in the case of Mario Galaxy, that didn't matter at all.
It's just a pre-mo 3D Mario game. This very much felt like the hardware had morphed the software in a negative way. And so you being on a Nintendo magazine at the time, trying to be enthusiastic about those decisions must have been quite complicated to weigh up, I would expect.
Maybe it's just a scar of us going through this process of trying to be a hardcore Nintendo magazine at a time when Nintendo were not trying to be a hardcore Nintendo. But they still had it in them. They were still doing Galaxy, which was obviously just pure magic.
I loved Mario. I went into that mag with a huge... I think the last GameCube game I had really played to death was Mario Kart Double Dash.
It's also just a case of having to make a call really quickly, which I'd say a few of the other scores I regret also came out of. Just not having the time. Mario Kart is like an album you buy and you listen to for months and months before you know if you actually like it.
That's sometimes true with Mario Kart too. I didn't really dig Double Dash to begin with, but at university I must have played hundreds of hours of the battle mode. You find the bit that clicked.
I think it was also because the battle mode in Wii is so dire that I took it as a personal insult because I loved battle mode in Double Dash so much. I was reviewing it on behalf of my three friends who I played with at university. But that's maybe not particularly fair when you're writing for an audience of thousands.
Also, Mario Kart Wii was a phenomenally successful game.
Yeah, and wherever we scored, we wouldn't have made or broken that game.
No, but maybe you were tapping into how people felt about it at the time, which was, wow, I've bought this console, I've bought two games for it, I'll never buy more games for it, but boy, it's fun to play at Christmas with the whole family. That was very much what the Wii was about before people really turned on it. All right, so my next one, Far Cry 2, which I gave 7 out of 10 for X360 magazine in 2008.
So this is another of those games that I think has a real cult status. People kind of revere Clint Hocking, the game's creative director, who then went through a long period of working at different studios without releasing anything and has just recently released Watch Dogs Legion. But when I asked him about the notion of a Clint Hocking game at E3 last year, he rightly pointed out that hundreds of people make this game.
There is no Clint Hocking game to it. I have sensibilities that inform the game, but I'm paraphrasing here. He wasn't cross, was he?
No, no, not at all. I think he was just very keen to point out that these Ubisoft games are enormous and they require hundreds of people working really hard. Ubisoft had a load of other designers there who worked on the game, so it wasn't like they were saying, oh, it's the Clint Hocking game.
It was just a really cool opportunity to speak to him. Anyway, I gave it 7 out of 10 because I thought it was quite formless and joyless Far Cry 2. That was kind of what people liked about it.
You've got to go find the jackal and you can do it at your own pace and you form these alliances with these different NPCs. Then there's quite a significant late game twist that people really loved about that system. I don't think I quite played it enough at the time when I was reviewing it, but also I didn't think it was a very fun shooter.
Your guns jammed up a lot until you upgraded them. Things set on fire. Set pieces were quite...
You had malaria.
Yeah, exactly. That's famously quite a divisive system, but I wasn't a fan of it. I think it's quite telling that later Far Cry games would lean much more into being basically arcade-y shooters that happen to be set in an open world where lots of chaotic things get thrown together.
It's really incoherent. I think the newer ones, I don't really get them at all. You're just driving a truck and then you'll see three vehicles pull up, guys start fighting, and a tiger will come out of nowhere and start attacking a dude.
I see what you're going for, but this is just too chaotic. I don't think Far Cry 2 was all that, apart from the setting and the fire effects, they were very nice, but I thought it was quite a boring first person shooter. Do you regret this one?
Yeah, I think it probably should have just got an 8 out of 10. I did play it a bit more afterwards and enjoyed it slightly more, but I'm not massively off here, but I think that Far Cry 2 is still a game people talk about 12 years later, which makes me think I probably did just miss what was kind of magic about it, because I didn't give it enough time when I was reviewing it, which is, you know, a factor when doing this. So what about your next one, Matthew?
I'm going to jump Red Steel because I feel like I've talked about it endlessly. You know, like I said, while I stand by most of the stuff I said in the review, if the score seems off, it's probably because it was those weird circumstances, and I was wrestling with lots of lots of stuff. I want to do a weird double bill of Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations, which is the third one, and Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.
Trials and Tribulations, I gave 81, even though it is one of my favorite games. And Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth, I gave 79. So that's only 2% less, and I fucking hate that game.
And I was just looking at these scores, and they just really jumped out at me. How can I have only come to 2% difference, even though I really love one and I really dislike the other? And I think it's something to do with, like...
I think there are certain... The downside maybe of scores is that if you are religiously adhering to certain stuff, and you're trying to put everything in context, there are just a few weirdo games that don't quite fit in anywhere. And if you try and play by the other's rules, it kind of messes them up.
You know, like, I don't... You know, I think the logic behind The Ace Attorney only being in 81, which is still a good score, but, you know, it's easily like a 9 out of 10 for me. And I absolutely love the story, but that's all it is.
It's just a story. And I thought, well, you know, this is a video game, and we're meant to be celebrating the kind of interactivity. I had this idea of the one thing it was trying to do, it did brilliantly, and I don't know why I didn't reward it for that, rather than mark it down for not doing stuff that it wasn't even trying to do, really.
So with this, what had NGamers scored the other two Phoenix Wright games?
Basically, all around that, around the 80 mark.
Yeah. So, see, if I was in their position, when I played that first Phoenix Wright game on my DS Lite in 2006, I was blown away by it because I'd never played a visual novel. It was just amazing.
But it did seem like critical reception called on it, because, like you say, there's not much innovation. And I think that a big thing they did in the first one was they added that case at the end that required you to do the different DS functionality. It didn't work all that well, but it did at least suggest that some effort had been put into expanding it, whereas the next two, I think, were just the games on GBA but made for DS.
And maybe that was a factor as well.
Yeah, that could have been a factor. Yeah, I felt like it just wasn't started. It's weird.
So I reviewed a few games like Ace Attorney or Professor Layton, things like that, for Edge magazine over the years. And weirdly, they were kind of like sixes in Edge, I think, because they're weird criteria. They've never quite fit in any kind of criteria.
And it's taken them to some weird places. I just don't... Now I would be a lot more comfortable just reviewing it on like the pure joy it brought me, where I think for some reason now I felt like I really had to justify it on some mad invisible scale.
Well, the 100% invisible scale. And the Miles Edgeworth one, I just have no idea what I was thinking because I really dislike that game. I think it's such a lowlight in the series.
So I had no idea what I gave it, 79. I just maybe just couldn't bring myself to like comprehend that the thing I once loved was rubbish. But it got good again, so I'm kind of over that now.
That's fine. Did you review the fourth Thirfinnits right game, the one whose name I've forgotten?
Apollo Justice. Yeah, I think they got an 8 as well. They're all like around that mark.
That one I'm a little cool on as well.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a strange thing. I just think when something's so in your wheelhouse that sometimes bumps up the score or messes with the score in weird ways that other games don't. Yeah, that's a strange one.
That's an interesting example for sure.
This next one I'm super of yours. I'm really, really keen to hear about because this does seem like madness to me.
Yeah, so I reviewed Batman Arkham Asylum for X360 magazine in 2009. I gave it a 7 out of 10. My editor at the time, Simon Miller, talked me into giving it an 8 out of 10 and I think he was correct.
And most people would agree with Simon on that as well. So yeah, I'm a big Batman fan for sure. And this was like the ultimate Batman game.
So you would think, you know, why wouldn't you love it or whatever? And I think this was one that suffered from the fact that I played it so much in preview that I'd started to really see the flaws of it. One thing that was really unusual about Arkham Asylum is they sent out preview code that had the very famous scarecrow sequences in them.
That was, I think, a really good decision because that would never happen now in the world of kind of like NDAs and people really kind of managing information in games and stuff like that. But it really allowed people to see what Rocksteady were going for in terms of narrative ambition and doing something a bit different. So that was really cool.
But I think by the time the game actually came out, I think I played the preview build twice and I was kind of like, ah, I have to do all these sections again. And I really started to zone in on the one thing I really hate about Arkham Asylum, which is the fights with bigger enemies are terrible.
The sort of Titan Brutes.
And people really forget what a large part of the game they constitute. When people remember this game, they think about the setting and what it's like to kind of glide as Batman, to do the Batman combat, go into his Batcave and when the plane turns up, all those are really good moments. But people don't remember the last third is basically fighting those big enemies over and over again.
And there's no real nuance to it, which I think is a shame because the combat is otherwise so good when you're fighting individual enemies. And I think that that's why I think The City, the next game in the series, is a lot better. But I think I did score this wrong because I just had to remember what games were like in 2009, but a Batman game that came out of nowhere and just blew people away the year after The Dark Knight came out, people were so ready for it.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh God, it was magic. I was really, yeah, that was like one of the few games here. Like you say, it just genuinely blew me away in that generation because I hadn't played any of it.
You know, I was on Nintendo Mags, so, you know, just playing as a punter without knowing much about it. It was just an absolute thrill. And you're right, it is locked away in my head.
It's just like, oh, you know, I'm one of those boring people who will be like, oh, Arkham Asylum is actually the best one. But then I only remember the first half of it because I replayed it recently. And yeah, you're right.
It's like, it is shaky. It gets much shakier. I don't think the boss fights are very good in it.
No, none of them are. None of them are. Whereas I think there's only one real good boss fight in the series.
That's the Mr. Freeze one in the second game. But I mean, yeah, I mean, I think 7 out of 10 was very harsh when you...
Yeah, and it was just so polished and exciting to see Batman done, like, well, you know. And it's a good Batman. Like, I like the version of Batman as well.
Yeah, they do his universe really well. It's a really good kind of like, sort of an old boss of mine used to use this description of Star Wars. And where the first Star Wars film was so good is that whole universe is out the corner of your eye, and it's not about the universe.
It's just there in the background. Whereas I think that works really well about this game, too, is you don't have every single enemy in there. You have, like, hints of the different enemies in his universe, but you get just to, like, a handful of them, and it's enough to make you feel like, oh, I'm in the DC universe.
You know, all of this, I'm coexisting with all of this. Yeah, so, yeah, I was wrong about that one. I would definitely call it...
Eight might have even been a bit harsh for X360. We weren't edge, like, maybe we should have just given it a nine and got on with it. But I think I just got into my head a bit too much about the big enemies and so, hey, you know.
All right, so the next one's interesting because we both have it. So, yeah, do you want to introduce this one?
Yeah, this is near...
2011, near, I think it was? I think it was 2011, near?
Yeah, which I played on 360. I gave it 65% and my quote on Metacritic is quite easily the best, not very good game we've played in a while, which I think shows the beginning of me wrestling with like trying to review games which are maybe like destined to be cult classics.
Right, yeah.
How did you score it?
I gave it 54% for Play Magazine on PS3. And yeah, I don't think I even vaguely tweaked the elements that would go on to define it as a cult classic. I just thought it was a bad action game with really annoying cutscenes and loads of boring minigames.
Yeah, I still like NieR or Tomasa or Automata, however you pronounce it. But I do wonder if a lot of people reviewed it through the lens of knowing that the first one is a cult classic. Like not many of these kind of classic seven out of tens, but some people love them games, get sequels.
But you don't often review knowing that you've got that sort of in its past. And yeah, I find the series quite hard. Don't get me wrong, the NieR or Tomasa or Automata.
Auto Tomato, I believe it's called.
Yes, that's it. It's like the much better game. I think it's a much more satisfying action experience and it does more obviously interesting things.
But yeah, this one like threw me at the time. And I think it took a couple of years for people to start talking about how much they sort of liked it or that it sort of went from a guilty pleasure into like, oh, actually, this is quite good to the point where it's now getting like remade next year because it deserves like a second swing, I believe is the case anyway.
Yeah, so I really love Auto Tomato. I would give that game a 9 out of 10, where the PC version not as bad as it is and the fact that they never addressed it was pretty bad on PC. It crashes in a bunch of places, but I really love the world and the sci-fi storytelling and the way it uses replaying the game to tell a continuous narrative.
The combat is really good, obviously, because Platinum made it, whereas I think this first game just... I don't think the first game is anywhere near as good. And you're right, it's really unusual that a game like this gets a sequel, let alone a sequel that sells like millions of copies.
Now Nier is big business for Square. It's like comparable to Final Fantasy in terms of its success in that second game. When does that ever happen?
Good for them, you know, for taking a punt.
I don't think the guy was wearing the moon head back then.
No, but then I didn't even know who the guy was.
That's something that's changed. I think they got a lot savvier in how to sell the second one. It is a better game, but I think there are other factors as to why it landed better than the first one, or so much better.
A massive factor. I think it's the Final Fantasy XII character designer to design the main characters, and it's like, well, you can tell the character designs are way better. Like, it's just a much...
Like you say, it just immediately grabbed people's imaginations, I think, with this kind of loose S&M design to the...
Yeah, the first one's just like some barbarian bloke. He's just some big bloke.
Yeah, he's quite a boring-looking bloke. It just looks like he could be played by Christopher Lambert or something in the film. So I didn't get it at all.
I just thought everything about it was quite bad. This very tedious story with your kid who is sick and you have to go out and get stuff for the kid, and then this other character turns up with a sword who's wearing skimpy clothing. I got none of it, but to be honest, I probably didn't give it enough time.
I think I played it for about 10 hours, but everyone was kind of like, oh yeah, well if you play it for 30 or 40 hours, then you start to really get its magic. And part of the process of reviewing games is sometimes you don't always get that.
I knew something, the quote on Metacritic, like I knew something was up with this game, and I think I acknowledged that I hadn't quite pinned it down. But, you know.
Yeah, you were quite spot on there. I don't think I got that at all. I think I just said this is a bad action game, and I don't like the progression system, it's confusing.
Yeah.
So I think I'm probably more wrong than you on that one. Alright, do you want to do your next one?
Yeah, this one I'll quite quickly, just because I'm quite embarrassed by it. We reviewed WiiWare games at the back of the mag in very small, little throwaway reviews, and we scored them out of five stars, so they wasn't on a percentage thing. And I gave Bit Trip Runner, which I don't know if you remember, was part of this retro anthology.
Well, it wasn't, I thought they released them separately, and it was this very old school, 8-bit looking auto runner, where it was like auto failure if you didn't jump over it. I don't quite think it's a rhythm game, but it's got that level of very tight choreography to the platforming. I gave it one star.
I hated it. I had a really rough time with it. It made me really, really cross.
And I just sort of went for it in a way that it was just dumb. It was just dumb and stupid. It isn't a one-star game.
It's completely wrong. Because I think like GamesTN gave it like nine or something. Because I remember talking, I'm pretty sure it was like Ash Day.
I was talking to an event about this. And he was genuinely disappointed in me. I think I actually lost a lot of respect when I was like, oh yeah, I get it.
Like, it wasn't like a ha ha ha, I'm going to kick this game's face off. But I was just so cross. And actually looking back at it, you were like, it's like the one thing I'm like embarrassed about.
I've never done it again to the best of my knowledge. Where I thought, you know what, I can't, you know, you can't just do that kind of bullshit. You can't just throw something in the bin and completely dismiss it.
Just basically tantamount to an angry YouTube comment. It's verging on like these stupid lazy developers. And I hate that.
I hate people who are like that. You know, I'm not all happy, clappy, everything, you know, let's look for the best in everything. But that's one I feel like I didn't give it a fair shake.
And like I haven't done that again since because, you know, it's amateur to do that.
Yeah, I think the language of games criticism has changed enough now that like that sort of take is frowned upon for sure. And this came up a bit on Twitter recently, I think. But yeah, it definitely seems low for what I remember to be a fairly well liked series.
But I did the same thing. I think like if you looked at any of my old play reviews where I gave, I think I gave like the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix game like 30 something percent, because it was kind of just a Wii game that had been retrofit onto PS3. But you used the analog sticks instead of the Wiimote to cast spells, which just did not work.
And I think I was very cruel to that game and a few others like it.
But sometimes a game can just get you on a bad day. So like that does happen.
Yeah, and also like I feel for the devs, but there are still publishers who make the decisions behind those games. And ultimately, as part of your job is to call that out. Like it is good to be respectful of the fact that there is no game made where people were lazy.
It just does not happen. But at the same time, like, I don't know, you have to call out bad decisions when you see them still. Because even if they're...
Yeah, for sure. That was, this wasn't that. This was just me being an asshole.
Yeah. Okay. Next one for me is Assassin's Creed in 2007.
I gave that 58% for Play Magazine. And I think that was too high. So I'm up and down on the Assassin's Creed series.
I think that, I think its legacy is both good and bad. I think that for a long time, games were kind of flattened out a bit in terms of difficulty for a while. And I kind of blame Assassin's Creed for that.
Until like the From Software games got big and difficulty became like a bit more of a thing people were into. And I think Assassin's Creed was a bad game. Like the first one was definitely bad.
It was a terrible action game, very, very simple sort of counter-attack based action game with very few combat options. And I remember when I interviewed a developer about Assassin's Creed Unity in 2014, they said, we want to get back to the first Assassin's Creed game feeling of like, choose to do this assassination however you want. And I was there thinking that wasn't the first game.
The first game was chase after a dude and then knife him after doing a couple of bad minigames where you eavesdrop on people in this...
Oh, structurally it was abysmal.
Yeah, it was bad. In this very pretty open world, like very impressive technically at the time, open world. And I was very down on it.
And this score, I fiddle with a lot. I think like a lot of people that imagine felt the same way about Assassin's Creed and scored it low. And Games TM gave it 4 out of 10.
And I think that was correct because I honestly think that these were, I'm not giving myself too much credit here, but like pretty much all of the Imagine outlets were in the lowest bracket of that first game on Metacritic.
Right.
And I think if people hadn't called Ubisoft out for the problems in those games, I don't think that second one would have been as good. And this is where I think that actually like giving low review scores is ultimately good for games generally. I think that all the things that we called out were fixed in the second one, had more variety, a much better structure, a really good main character, a really good story mode, all this stuff.
And all that stuff was with things that we were calling out for the lack of them in the reviews. So I think we were spot on to like camera Assassin's Creed.
Yeah, I think so too. I remember playing that because I remember playing it for a bit, hating it and giving up on it. And then when 2 came out and everyone started reviewing it, saying this is amazing, I thought, wow, I better finish one so I can enjoy the story of 2 better.
And I can like literally howling with despair at Assassin's Creed 1, trying to finish it. It was so monotonous and the like just had the limited spread of what you could do in that game. It looked amazing and it was probably of that generation, you know, one of the first big next gen looking things.
Definitely.
Really.
And I think a lot of people reviewed it as such because they were just like, oh, wow, I've never seen a console game do look like this before. But blimey, it was just what a total misery that game was.
Yeah, it was nothing. I don't think there was anything fun about it at all. The platforming, combat, it's all pretty much automated.
None of it was fun. So yeah, that was that was quite a big one. I think I think I like went down at one point to like 46%, something like that.
And then I think I taught myself into like, oh, no, maybe a bit high. I mean, it is technically impressive. And again, it's that continuity of like, well, we've given some right shit, like 50%.
And so maybe being a bit harsh on some obvious art history has gone into making this part of this game really good. It's just it doesn't work overall. So quite complicated.
But yeah. So what's your next one, Matthew?
This one's not massively spicy, but it was Resident Evil Revelations, which I gave them 90%. And in my notes here, I've written, a bit of a 3DS drought made me too thirsty.
Those are rough early days.
They were. I mean, that was pretty more so than other things. And the 3DS launch lineup was pretty bad.
And I liked the hardware a lot. I was a big fan of the DS. I thought 3DS could do some great stuff and the good games did come.
And this was like the first big, it was like a graphical showcase. And I don't know why graphics became such a sort of bug bear, you know, because we were on Wii and we were always like the laughing stock of, you know, the office because our games, you know, even the good looking ones were, you know, it was always a tribe of art design over like technical heft. And this was like a really shy and it looks amazing.
And it was like a work compared to everything else in 3DS. It was like impossible to comprehend like just how it was working, how they were doing it. It looked great.
It looked and sounded great.
Yeah, you know, and it felt like a big system seller. But it's in hindsight, it's just, I think, still evidence of a series that was still figuring out what its next move was. It was still living in that weird shadow of Resident Evil 4, which hung over it for so long, you know, still a little bit now, although it's largely out of it.
I don't know, Resi Remake 2 feels like a version of Resident Evil 4 to me.
Yeah, but I think it felt like it, I feel like they were trying to one-up Resi 4 for a few games, and it just wasn't the right way to go. They were becoming more and more actiony and losing trade. This had a bit, you know, the kind of haunted ship.
It was a bit more like sort of trad Resi 1. But I think fundamentally, the shooting, it feels like non-existent. It just feels like the number that pops out of things when you shoot them is that's the thing that's hitting them.
There's no sense of a bullet. And you're shooting these very vague meat monsters, which compared to the exciting headshots of Resi 4 or whatnot, or what you're trying to get to, it's just not a very satisfying feeling game. And you can't say that about a lot of the Capcom, whatever their failings, Capcom Resident Evil often feels quite nice, the newer action ones.
So that was just like a bit of probably feeling a bit of pressure from where everything else was and the need for us to have something to gloat about probably overinflated that one. It's not dire, but it's not a 90.
Yeah, I think I really remember what the early days of the 3DS were like. It was just a real bleak, there's nothing to play on this kind of system. And then within about, I think even like a year, Nintendo got Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart onto the market.
And it's like, okay, this system is amazing. You just needed the right games for it. And yeah, that was like a real early big third person game.
So I get it. But you can definitely tell in the responses to the game when it revealed a release on other formats later on that it was definitely an also-ran Resi game.
Yeah, for sure.
Yeah, no one's favorite. My last one then is Lego Batman, the original Lego Batman.
Who hates Lego Batman?
Probably best known as the game that is used to crack the Wii software for piracy. That was Lego Batman, wasn't it? I think that's the game.
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't do it, but I know that you can, I think there's some kind of exploit you can use in the original box copy to crack the Wii software.
Surprise it open.
I don't really understand the ins and outs of it. I remember reviewing it and thinking, so I don't think this is an all-time classic or anything, but I gave it two out of five for 360 magazine, which is different from X360 magazine. And that was quite harsh.
There was nothing really, like you say, remotely offensive about it. I think it's just that I think the other Lego game's strength was being based on films and TV shows meant that you had really good touchstones for the cutscenes and stuff, whereas this was like an original Batman thing. And I thought it was just really boring.
And I think I just turned on the Lego games quite quickly and then came back around to them when they started getting really good again.
I quite like this one. I think it had the Danny Elfman soundtrack, which was like, I was a big Danny Elfman sort of nerd, so that was...
The second one's loads better, though. The second one's got the open world.
Yeah, definitely. It's just the one that had Superman as well, right?
Yes, and you took off and then the John Williams Superman theme. Which is one of the best moments, I think, in any game that no one talks about.
Yeah, it is weird. It's weird how that is one of the best moments in any game.
Well, do you know what I mean, though? It was just like, I can't believe this is in a Lego game. I feel like this is a Superman experience I've been waiting for in games forever.
It is the best Superman game by like a million miles.
Yeah, yeah. So that's a short one there. But that takes us on to your final one, Matthew.
Yeah, this was just like this Disney Epic Mickey. I gave it 86.
Was it good?
Like everyone was so like high on Disney Epic Mickey, which sounds mad, but you've got to believe me. This was this was the case.
I remember.
Just because it was the third party game where like they were really pulling out all the stops. You know, Disney were throwing huge amounts of money at it. You know, Warren Spector was making it.
It just felt like, wow, this, you know, the guy who made their sex is coming. He's making a wee exclusive about Mickey Mouse. I can only half remember the thing, so I've probably butchered this, but like they had to get the right.
There were certain rights to Mickey Mouse had been given to someone else.
Was it the Oswald the Rabbit thing? They had to get the rights?
Maybe it was Oswald the Rabbit. They had to literally trade like a real human being, like sports presenter on one of them Disney related networks. They had to trade like an actual man to get the rights to this cartoon rabbit.
Imagine feeling like, wow, that rabbit is more valuable to Disney than me, a human being. What a slam. If only I could remember the details, but that's definitely true because that was their big thing.
They made this big talk when we went to see it. We all, bizarrely, they introduced, they showed us the game in a special, modified double decker bus. This Disney Epic Mickey bus.
This is such a late noughties games, media event nonsense.
And more respectively, brilliant at talking about the game.
Was he driving the bus?
He's super into Disney history and stuff. I just thought it was, well, obviously not. I gave it 86, but that was just me buying into the hype.
And it's embarrassing to say that, because you're like, what hype? It's Disney Epic Mickey.
I remember this, the hype though. What people probably don't recall about this game is that I think whenever they revealed it in Game Informer or something, it was described as like Disney via Bioshock, and the concept art looked amazing. Oh, it was amazing, yeah.
Because it had this big thing where you had a paintbrush that could paint in objects, and he had like an eraser brush that could destroy objects. And it was this thing of like power of creation and destruction. What kind of Mickey are you going to be?
Are you going to melt like Goofy? And you were like, wow, cool. You know, it sounded so exciting.
And there was some interesting stuff with the brushes, but fundamentally, the platforming was just horrible. And it basically boiled down to like, there's a door in your way, a raise the door or paint in some blocks to jump over the door. It was just really basic stuff.
It had these 2D levels, which paid sort of homage to classic Disney cartoons, which we were like, wow, this is so cool. But I don't really like classic Disney cartoons, so I don't know why I thought that was cool. It's like most of them star kind of racist crows.
So it was like jumping around with lots of racist crows. Not a very satisfying platformer, just bought into the Epic Mickey hype and good god, 86. And then the sequel came out and everyone drugged it with like 4 out of 10s.
I think it was just really obvious it was just a bad third person platformer when it came out.
Yeah, I don't know what happened there. I should have known better.
I'm so down on other platforms, third person platformers, 3D platformers. I'm so down on Crash and Spyro. And somehow this terrible example of the genre sort of snuck past me and I gave it an 86.
More than Phoenix Wright, Drosser Tribulations.
I think you just, again though, people are going to be divorced in the context of like the Wii had no games. It just needed games.
It should have known better. I really like Man Alive. It's like, it's one of those, if you go back in time and assassinate Hitler, you know, I would go back in time and punch myself in the face before I gave Disney Epic Mickey 86%.
Yeah. I think even it's like Disney cartoon thing had been done and I think, Disney's Epic Adventure, Mickey's Epic Adventure or something on the PlayStation did something similar like, yeah, I mean, it happens, you know, like, yeah, I think a lot of these high scores just happen when you're on a platform that's deprived of good games and then suddenly a game that's not terrible comes in, like, that was where I found I was making like my worst decisions when I was on play.
I made a terrible mistake.
All right, then, well, those were our games. Those are the ones I could think of, like, after this, I think I felt like I was pretty good at scoring games later on in my games media career. None of my PC Gamer scores really stand out as like, oh, that was a terrible error.
Like, I gave Metal Gear Solid 5 like 93%, which I think people would say is a bit generous because they really hate the ending of that game and the fact that it just kind of ends, but I disagree and really love that game.
I gave it a 10 in OXM.
Nice. Well, it's just I don't even agree about the ending. I think it's got an ending and I like the ending, but most people don't.
And even if you don't like the ending, it's like 40 hours of the best technical stealth game Kojima ever made.
Yeah, exactly. And the take I will not tolerate is the take that says ground zeroes is better.
Oh no.
That's just like, I just can't be doing it.
I didn't even know that was a take. I can't even comprehend someone thinking that.
It's like, well, the game is the exact same thing, except there are loads of different bases you can go to and do stuff anyway. So yeah, to close out then, Matthew, we've kind of addressed this with you, I guess, as a bit trip runner, but I was curious to know what the lowest score you ever gave to a game was. What about percentage wise, an NGamer, could you remember this?
So I find it tricky to pick out. There was a game, I don't know if this counts, because it was a bit of a joke score, but it wasn't. There was a Japanese import game I reviewed called Doki Doki Majo Shin Pan.
And I don't know what, well, I have vague memory of why we reviewed it, because it was slightly controversial, but it was about, you went to a, you were a witch finder, a witch hunter at a school, and one of these teenage girls was a witch, and the only way a witch's birthmark would appear was if you got their pulse racing. So you had to sort of rub their legs and stuff to get them excited, to reveal them as a witch. And it was just grim, and we probably shouldn't have reviewed it, but it seemed funny at the time, and instead of a score, it just got no.
With a percentage sign.
They had to modify the score box to fit it, and it just said no. Which was probably, like, technically, like, I guess, the lowest score I've ever given. Like, I wouldn't even countenance giving it 1%.
It was just, it was just boring and tacky and salacious and unpleasant. So, yes, what about you?
Well, I was thinking about it, I think in terms of how numbers work. Lord of the Rings Conquest, which I gave 1 out of 5 for 360 magazine. Again, different from 360 magazine.
That was the lowest score and I think that, I think I probably should have given that 2, but it was terrible. People don't really remember this, but the makers of Star Wars Battlefront made a Battlefront game with Lord of the Rings. It came out, you know, not long after Battlefront 2 did, a very beloved game in retrospect, but it was absolutely terrible.
It was a really budget translation of the Lord of the Rings universe, even though on paper I thought that is such a good idea for a game. You've got all these hero characters, you've got the different sides, you've got the different settings. What a great idea.
It was just really unbalanced. All the wizard characters were really overpowered, and they'd do these AoE attacks that would knock you over if you were a melee fighter. It was in such poor shape when it released.
It's probably one of the worst games EA has ever released.
This one passed you by completely.
Yeah, 2008, I think it came out. But yeah, I gave that one out of five. I think that probably was a review where I gave it an unprofessional kicking, even though I'm sure that a pandemic didn't make it bad on purpose.
I bet it was a matter of time and resource in not getting the same investment that Star Wars did. But yeah, it was just a shame because I was quite big on pandemic games. I enjoyed the Mercenary series, and I thought the Battlefront games were really good.
I quite enjoyed the Saboteur that came out in 2009, the last game. But yeah, I think that was the lowest. I was just a devastated Lord of the Rings character, and now I'm very over Lord of the Rings, so I don't care what happens to it now.
I'd rather... The things I'm proud of are where I pinned down why I really loved something, which I think is harder to do. I think it's quite hard to articulate why something works and why it works for you and why it might work for other people.
Those are the reviews I admire, rather than the kind of lethal drubbing, I think.
I completely agree with you. That's certainly the way most people review now. I find myself getting a lot less frustrated by reviews now than I did maybe 15 years ago.
I think everyone's better. Even the jokes about the people who used to be held as bad reviewers are no longer really that bad. It's all fine.
Yeah, absolutely. Well, that takes us out of this episode of Matthew. What a fun discussion that was.
Yeah, it was good. So full of regrets.
It was good to air those out so I could move on with my life psychologically.
