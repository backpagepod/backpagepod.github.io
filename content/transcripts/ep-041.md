I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, is this the longest we've ever gone without recording an episode together? It's been more than two weeks, right?
Oh yeah, it has, because we did a batch. We got a batch in the can, as we say in the biz, and yeah, it has been a while.
Yeah, summer has ended.
I hope we remember how to do it.
Yeah, exactly, well, I just talked over you, so that's a good sign.
Oh jeez, we never do that. I think we should just call it quits.
Yeah, that's it. This is the end of the podcast. We're gonna go out on a bang as I talk about 20 or so more pointless purchases that I've made on eBay.
So Matthew, I was actually really shocked to discover that the first Bad eBay Games Court episode we did was back in early March. So it has been six months since that episode. Where did this year go?
It's crazy, right?
Unbelievable. Time flies when you're having fun.
Yeah, we have a big question mark there. And an umlaut over the U for no reason. Okay, cool.
So yes, Matthew, I suppose before we get to that then, I've got 20 or so more purchases for you to order in Gamescore and decide whether I live or die, which will be fun. The PS2 mini draft, we haven't discussed the results of it on the podcast yet. So I won by about 55% to 45%.
There was a really solid effort from you actually. And I was curious what you made of the results.
Yeah, I'm sort of surprised it was that close. Because obviously that episode doesn't end on a high for me. And I think a lot of people coming out, you know, they're so colored by the pick of Red Faction that they forget all my other good stuff.
So I'm glad that some people really sat there and thought about it and went, you know what, actually, there's some quality here. Yeah, for a non-PS2 person, I think I did okay.
Yeah, I think what it taught me was that if you have two or three games that people really love, that can triumph over having a more consistent selection of five games or 10 games. I think people really just love Vice City or Metal Gear Solid 3 and that did a lot of heavy lifting for you. Yeah, definitely.
Yeah, and so it made me think, actually, that perhaps picking Tony Hawk instead of Burnout was the wrong pick because maybe that Tony Hawk remaster got that series out of the system a little bit, whereas Burnout feels a bit more elusive these days. But yeah, there's some thoughts there. But hey, we're on your home turf next.
So later in September, we've got the N64 mini-draft that is replacing our best, previously advertised, best N64 games episode. We think this is a more fun format to do it and also less time-consuming to prepare. So yeah, I think that'll be fun.
How are you feeling about that one?
Yeah, it should be good. I mean, again, it's kind of whether you just push into more interesting spaces or go for the crowd pleasers. Yeah, we'll see.
Yeah, it could be chaotic, that one. That's one where if you go first, you may have an advantage inherently as well. So yeah, excited to see how that goes.
So Matthew, on top of Gamescourt, later in this episode, we've got a brief segment about Deathloop and No More Heroes 3, which I've been playing the former, you've been playing the latter, so people can look forward to that towards the end of the episode. But in the meantime, then, let's crack on with the Gamescourt retrials. So basically, for people who didn't listen to the first episode, it's in our archives, obviously.
I have spent a lot of the lockdown during the pandemic buying games on eBay for no real reason other than I think like restaurants were closed. So I thought I will just hoard, I will hoard DS games in lieu of having like meaningful experiences with my girlfriend. So that's essentially what happened there.
And I survived the first sort of like trial, but now we've got a retrial coming up, Matthew. And I'm curious for you as the judge coming into this, what do you make of revisiting the Games Court idea?
Yeah, well, you know, I'm interested because obviously a lot of these purchases you've made have been made in the shadow of the first Games Court. So I'm wondering if the threat of execution, which I should point out is how Games Court concludes if you fail. It's a pretty bleak ending for an otherwise quite jolly segment of this podcast.
And I wondered if the threat of death would maybe inform your purchases, make you a bit more of a careful buyer.
Well, oh, I mean, yeah, a jury's out quite literally on this one. It's actually, I would say it starts bad, like real bad, and then it gets better. And I think that people will enjoy the variety of games I've got in this episode.
I mean, actually, a lot of them are inspired by, you know, listening to you talk about working on Endgame or uncovering DS games. So there's a lot of Matthew Castle fodder in here.
Well, that would be pretty churlish of me to say those are bad games. I can't just come and turn around on my old opinions just for the sake of trying to push you towards the electric chair. Is it an electric chair or is it lethal injection?
Well, it's inspired by the Phoenix Wright games, right? Do they ever tell you how they're killing them?
No, they just say execute.
Oh, nice. Lovely. You know, seems like a fair system, but yeah.
It really is like I do quite like that as a sort of bit of drama in those in those games. So it's like, oh, that is actually like really grim. But it's like it's all puns and sort of like wacky animations until someone gets the electric chair.
But it all happens off screen and is never mentioned again.
Yeah, you just get confetti on the screen. Congratulating you on a job well done.
Oh, imagine being having confetti raining. Because the person who is accused, you know, the person you reveal to be the baddie is in the courtroom at the time. So they're also having that confetti rain on them, despite the fact that they know they're about to be executed.
Yeah, they're being wheeled out as like, you know, the confetti goes off. And it's like, yeah, no confetti for you. You're going to be dead in two days, grim stuff.
So yeah, that's fun. So basically, if I die at the end of this, there can be no more Gamescore, unless somehow there's a Phoenix Wright style, I don't know, like a stone is used to summon my spirit from the dead to put me on trial again in future.
Well, yeah, you can possess a spirit medium. And all of a sudden, you will appear in their outfit.
Yeah, exactly. I will be dressed as Pearl Fey, which will be a treat for everyone involved, I'm sure. Yeah, so good stuff.
Yeah, so what's interesting with this one is that I think like to add a bit more drama to it. What we're going to do this time, I'm explaining this as the person who's on trial, but for each guilty verdict, as in for each game that Matthew decides that was not a worthwhile purchase, I lose three points. But for each not guilty verdict on a game that I bought, I only gain one.
So the stakes have never been lower, frankly. It's going to be exciting stuff.
So I think this speaks to a quiet confidence that you're going to walk it, because that's quite a hefty penalty for a bad game.
It is, but I will say Matthew, I mean, just to kind of like tease what's to come, I have two Sonic games and one Pokemon game. So, you know, there you go.
I should add that like, you know, my judgments, they aren't based on popular opinion. They're based on just my wins.
Yeah, exactly. That's just the law.
I believe judges say that at the start of trials.
That's basically Judge Judy's whole deal, isn't it? That's like, you know, this is, I operate as my own judicial system.
I just want everyone to know, this court operates on like, gut feeling, rather than technical law.
Okay, to kick off then Matthew, so last time we did this, the courtroom was rife with all kinds of like, wacky characters. We had a poorly rendered Chewbacca from The Masters of Terris Carsey in there. I think I had the L Block from Tetris in there, like wearing a suit.
He had to go take a call from his wife at some point. Wario might have been there. I can't really recall.
Who's in the courtroom this time for this trial?
We've got all kinds of people. We've got Herlock Shomes from The Great Ace Attorney.
Okay, has he been doing some background work on me or something?
He's kind of like my private investigator, so he does the investigation segments, but he likes to sit out and watch. We've got Wario again.
Great, great.
I think he just wants to see an execution.
That's sick fuck.
That's very much Wario's deal. We've got a load of Pikmin, piled up and wearing a coat to pass himself off as a person. I think they might also carry you to the execution chamber.
Wow, that is what they're good at.
That's very much their deal. Just to make some noise and really get the place jumping because I like an energetic court, we've got a load of tap dancing monkeys from Riven Heaven.
Okay, good. It's a pretty wild bunch. Yeah, it is.
Maybe some other people will enter as we go on and let's see what happens.
Yeah. Okay, so I got to pick a lawyer for this. I requested Miles Edgeworth, but my request was denied.
The request was like basically on the basis that I knew that the judge respected the lawyer. So I thought, well, that will help a little bit. But Miles Edgeworth wasn't having any of it.
So I've been assigned one of the Payne family to represent me. Oh, unfortunately, his wig flew off as he entered the courtroom, which is, you know, not a harbinger of things to come, perhaps. But yeah, so yeah, so before we kick it, we kick off with this, it will probably be a while before we do another Gamescore episode, because I noticed that my purchases basically stopped when the lockdown lifted.
And I could basically spend my money on doing the thing I enjoy more than anything else, which is going for lunch with my girlfriend in Bath basically. So I think these were definitely filling a hole during the pandemic times. I've also reached a point, Matthew, where a lot of the tasty DS games I want are so expensive that I can't really justify it.
Like a couple of the Castlevania games and Ghost Trick. I've given up on Ghost Trick. I almost got it from CEX, but they were out of stock after I bought it.
So I just bought the iOS version in the end. But oh God, it doesn't look as nice on my iPad as it would on a DS. That's tragic.
But yeah. The other thing is I actually found out I'd bought three fake DS games on eBay. And I realized afterwards what a sucker I was because I thought I got such a killer bargain for Apollo Justice on DS.
I think I bought it for like 10 quid and it's like never available for 10 quid. It's like always 40 quid. And I was looking into it and I realized that yeah, there is like a way you can tell that your DS games are fake.
There's an indented arrow that points down from the cartridge that tells you where to place the console. If it's indented, it's fake. But if it's like glossed over, it's got like a glossy effect, then it's real.
That's basically the way you can tell. So Apollo Justice was fake. And I had a weirdly Mario and Luigi partners in time was fake.
Who's building their criminal empire off of cloning those?
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, exactly. So yeah, that was that was some fun. But I'm guessing Matthew that you're purchasing habits, you still don't really hoard stuff, do you?
You're just not at all. So are you are you putting the fake games in the in the, you know, are you presenting them today?
No, because I've owned those for years. And I actually only discovered they were fake, like recently.
So these are all they would have been. Even if they're good games, they'd be guilty, you know, guilty charges just for like being a dupe.
Yeah, does that mean that? Yeah, I am contributing to crime. Does that mean that I've already lost like six points based on those?
Well, we won't we won't include them. But had you try to include them? Yeah, that would have been would have been the case.
I thought you were going to say I bought three 3DS games and I discovered that they were fake because they were all on the same cart. And on the front of the box, it was called 1000 Games in One. Wow, lucky me.
Catherine's got like a Game Boy game, which is called like 100 Game Boy classics.
Okay, so Matthew, should we take a short break then and then we'll come back and the judge can convene the court and deliver any opening statements. Would that be appropriate?
My decision is final, as has been said. It's based entirely on gut feeling. You can't argue with any of my critical opinions.
Also, I hope there aren't any pit men in here today pretending to be a person in a coat, because I've already said I don't want that in my court. So let's find out what happens.
Okay, good stuff. On a complete side note, I was so shocked to learn recently that the hunters in Halo are actually like worms inside a big carapace. They're like a big parasite-y thing.
That was quite...
I always thought they looked a little bit like the Pepper Army monster.
What, just inside some art battle armor?
Yeah. And I'd just like to add, it's quite nice that we can have this conversation, you the defendant, me the judge. It's nice.
It's a nice way to start.
This is what happens when the judge runs his own mad Colonel Kurtz style justice system.
That's like the idea that someone's on trial and they open up by just telling an anecdote about Halo to try and just endear themself to me.
Exactly. Yeah. Okay, good.
Are you going to bang your hammer now? Do you bang your hammer now and we have to bring out the first exhibit?
Yeah. I wish I had a soundboard that I could do the hammer. If we ever get to the third criminal court, I'll do that.
Well, no, the good thing is I can cut in the Phoenix Wright sound effects because there's a soundboard where you can download all the MP3s.
Oh, nice.
Don't tell Capcom that in case they sue us.
Bang, bang, bang.
Oh, no. I'll cut that sound effect in as well.
Okay, good stuff. So, exhibit A. It's as bad as it gets to start with Matthew.
I don't even remember why I bought this.
Judge Matthew, please.
Yeah, sorry, Judge Matthew. Okay, so as I present this, Payne's wig has just flown off.
Oh, that's a good sign.
That's the second time today.
I'm going to make a note in my big judge's notebook that that is suspicious.
Okay, exhibit A. Oh, God. It's Detective Pikachu on 3DS.
I bought this for £13.50 on the 28th of February. I don't remember why I bought this other than thinking, will this be... This is kind of a novel idea for a Pokemon game.
It's a kind of point and click adventure thing. I got it, played it. It's really, really boring.
Like it's a point and click game for children with no taste, basically. Really, really disappointing. So I can't justify it in any way.
I know this is not going to go in my favour, but you've just got to own this shit and get it over with, Matthew. Where are we at with that one?
Yeah, I mean, there's a tiny little voice in my head says, well, you know, it's part of an interesting varied collection, you know? Like it's an interesting curio to own, but it's just not very good. And it reminds me of the film, which I also didn't like.
So, yeah, I mean, that's just straight up guilty.
Yeah, fair enough. I've seen that film twice now because my friend came over last weekend and insisted on putting it on. It is pretty terrible, isn't it?
I mean, like, if money is for anything, it's to get Bill Nighy to explain the origins of Mewtwo. It's just wild. Okay, yeah, so that's fair that that's gone against me.
I don't contest that. So we'll just move on to Exhibit B. Oh boy, okay, so like I said, it gets bad, then it gets better.
So we've got Sonic Chronicles The Dark Brotherhood on DS, which I bought on 28th of February for £4.77, which is very, very cheap. So I did originally own this. I don't know what happened to it over the years.
I might have given it to my brother or something. But Bioware RPG with Sonic characters, I remember thinking was like a seven out of 10 at the time. To play it now, it's like not very fun.
It has the kind of sort of Mario Luigi combat style sort of where you're tapping the screen to perform different moves. But I don't know. It's actually like a bit of a headache of a game that we've talked about on the Sonic episode about how the soundtrack's just a series of bleeps and bloops.
So it's just very confusing. Yeah, I don't really rate it. But again, I think like the thinking here was as part of a varied DS collection, with which I now have about 100 DS and 3DS games combined, I don't think it's that bad for the price.
What do you think, Judge?
Well, I think I actually think I like, I didn't kick the face off this in Endgamer back in the day, because I think I was swept up with just the, oh, someone's really putting a lot of effort into something, or it felt like they were treating it with a bit of respect, which always got you a few bonus points. But that was back then, I think the Sonic Dark Brotherhood discourse has clearly sided on, it's not very good. And it's in this period that you bought it second hand.
I mean, I could have probably forgiven the original purchase. It's mad that you've bought it twice. So yeah, I mean, this one's guilty as hell.
So six points down, right?
Yeah, you're currently minus six. Which means, you know, Wario is rubbing his hands together. You think he's going to get to see a corpse today.
And a coat just collapsed mysteriously. Okay, good stuff. This is where it gets slightly better.
So this is exhibit C, Ghost Recon Shadow Wars for $3.99 on the 6th of March, 2021. 3DS game. I think I bought this straight after we recorded our excellent and best 3DS games episode with Joe, which is one of my favorites that we've done.
This came up. It's by, designed by Julian Golop, the XCOM creator. It is like XCOM.
It is basically XCOM with Tom Clancy characters. A little whiff of Metal Gear acid on the PSP as well. Just kind of turn-based military style of it.
It just reminds me a bit of Metal Gear acid. So I played a bit of this. It's a perfectly good XCOM-like and probably one of the most interesting Tom Clancy games there is.
What do you think, Judge?
Yeah, I mean, this is like the sort of secret best 3DS launch game or one of the bests. Maybe there's one I'm forgetting. Yeah, absolutely rock solid.
Julian Gollett brings some charm to it. I wouldn't say it's a particularly characterful game because of the Tom Clancy kind of does for that. But yeah, absolutely rock solid, very enjoyable, little turn-based tactics game.
Doesn't exist in any other form as far as I know. So buying this for £3.99, that's a great shout.
OK, good stuff. I must admit, I thought this is, this really is like good, really good for what it is. It comes slightly before.
People really appreciate XCOM again. I feel like that for axis game in 2012 completely like reverses polarity on people's perception of Julian Gollop. And he suddenly like everyone's like, Oh, no, this guy is like a games industry legend and all of his games are really good.
And he kind of been making different versions of XCOM on different platforms. There's a Game Boy Advance one. I can't remember the name of it.
Yeah, Rebel Star.
Tactical Command or something.
Yeah.
Yeah. So, yeah, that's he's just been doing his thing quietly over the years. And now I think he's genuinely appreciated for it.
So that's that's cool. But yeah, I think, yeah, this is not that they had much competition, but yeah, best 3DS launch game. That sounds sounds about right.
So Exhibit D is a Project X Zone on 3DS 16th of March, 20 pounds, which is a good price for this game. So mashup game with Sega, Capcom and Namco characters. The Namco one's less exciting, I would say.
But Matthew, we talked a bit about this in the 3DS Games episode. What's your take on Project X Zone?
Yeah, I mean, it was almost more exciting to write about and anticipate than maybe play. Like, I don't think it is an exceptional game. I mean, it's exceptionally weird.
And a lot of I think a lot of thought and effort has gone into it to kind of bring all those universes together. You're right. It does suffer because the Namco stuff is exceptionally weird.
Like, it's not a good advert for Namco's in-house characters. But yeah, I'm not in love with it as an actual game. But the idea of it's wild.
I think it's a very I think it is a cool thing to have in your 3DS collection. £20? Yeah, I mean, I have to take your word for it.
That's a decent price. Yeah, why not? Sure.
Not guilty.
OK, cool. I almost bought the second one because that's got the Yakuza characters in it. But yeah, I did play a bit of this before this episode.
It's like it is like a tactical RPG sort of way. Yeah, but we do kind of real time combos as the battle start. It's a very odd thing, I would say.
But I can see how it gets the most out of its different characters by allowing them to do their own sort of specific animations from their games and stuff. It's just very, very strange, the pitch of it. It's like there's like a weird sort of strain of sort of like Japanese mashup games where you'll see characters from like Evangelion and stuff in a real mid-budget, like 5 out of 10 game.
That seems to be like a thing that happened for a while, but... Yeah. So Project A, so yeah, I don't regret buying this, but yeah, £20 was pretty good.
It generally goes for about £30 or more. So next up then Matthew is Exhibit E, Heavenly Sword on PS3. So bought this on 16th of March, wait sorry, 19th of March for £1.99.
So almost no money at all. To the point where I don't know why someone even bothered going to the post office with it. It's like you might as well not send it and not have to go anywhere.
I'd pay £2 not to go to the post office personally. So yes, I own this.
That's a terrible business plan.
Do you ever play this one Matthew? I think it passed you by right?
Yeah, this one passed you by. So like this one's based entirely on gut feeling. What did you make of it when it came out originally?
So I thought it was like an interesting 7 out of 10. I'm sure people who have listened to this podcast have noticed that I have quite a lot of affection for this weird early part of the PS3 lifespan. I sort of like a love-hate thing.
That's partly why I picked this up. I have like most of the PS3 exclusives on my shelf and this is one I didn't have. I actually haven't played it since it first came out when I gave it, I believe 76% for play, I think.
Maybe 78. So I gave it a guess of like a 7 out of 10 at a time judge. So factor that into your...
Yeah, I mean, I think Stockholm Syndrome may be playing a part here from those early PS3 days. You've seen it and you've had an opportunity to go back to those heady days. Something about the price of £1.99 on this makes me feel like the world has decided its value.
I feel like I haven't played it, but my gut is saying this has got to be guilty.
Wow, OK. That's like a bit of a shock verdict, I think.
It's... That's the court.
Because every time it flies off, one of the pitmen goes and catches it and brings it back.
Matthew, why is there a coat moving around on the floor of the courtroom?
I don't know. It happened during one of my many subway breaks.
This is some legal system you're operating here. Okay, cool. So yeah, I think that the next three are like pure Matt Castle choices.
So I'm pretty sure...
They better be for your sake. Currently, I've got my guy firing up old reliable. That's the electric chair.
Okay, good. Yeah. I love the idea of firing up.
I thought he was going to give it a test run. Just get someone to sit in it and then like, hey, Gary, just sit here. We'll just...
You have to sort of spin a wheel to charge it up.
It's like a DS mini game. He's got to deal with the stylus on the screen, you know.
Yeah, that's exactly how it works.
Okay, so exhibit F is another code to memories on DS. That's bought on the 31st of March for £8.78. So Matthew, why don't you talk about this one?
Because you know the game so well.
Yeah, this is Sing's first DS game. A game that for a long time was just sort of famous because it has a puzzle that you solve by closing the lid. Sing's sort of original gimmick and the thing they were famous for was using the hardware brilliantly in lots of different puzzles, where I think now actually what a lot of people look fondly on is more the tone and vibe of their games.
But back then it was more just like, these guys are so gimmicky, it's wild, you've got to play it. Yeah, I have a lot of affection for this game. I don't think it is their best work, like narratively.
It's quite simple. It's a lot more puzzle focused than story focused. I actually, when I interviewed for Endgamer, there was a writing test where he had to write a, you know, a hundred and fifty words review roundup style review before the interview.
This is what I wrote about. So I have a natural affection for it, because that's because I feel like I own my job to it a bit. Yeah, like a bit of a curio seemed to do better work, but I simply can't punish someone for including this.
So yeah, that's not guilty.
It totally belongs in a broad kind of like DS, 3DS collection as well, I think, the game like this. I will say, playing it, I didn't think the writing was very good. And I think that actually this kind of applies to the next game I'm going to pick as well.
But I sometimes think these games have like an amazing vibe but getting their own way a bit when it comes to mechanics or being a bit tedious for no reason. Whereas maybe like Hotel Dusk boils down what sings good at in a better way than this, Matthew, I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, this has like, this is shaped more like an adventure because you're going to this island to like try and find something. So it's got a bit more like momentum to it, which maybe sits at odds with their more mellow vibe where Hotel Dusk is about just hanging out at a quite boring hotel and so it kind of plays into, you know, their vibe better. But, you know, let's let's not try and talk yourself out of this one.
This is this is not guilty. Let's let's not color it.
Yeah, this is my only shot of not getting electrocuted. So I should go with it. Okay, Exhibit G is Flower, Sun and Rain on the DS, which I bought on 31st of March for £9.99.
Now, I think this is a worse game than another Code Two Memories because this really gets in its own way with like arbitrary mechanics and slow bits and stuff. I played about an hour of it, Matthew. I got to say it's like it's incomprehensible, but I would defend it as like a good curio for a DS collection again.
What do you think?
Yeah, I mean, I recommended it to pseudo fans back in the day. It is baffling. I think it's baffling to the point that I don't think it really makes sense as a standalone game.
Like it ties into the bigger pseudoverse in a way that you can't appreciate on DS because the other bits aren't there. It did make me laugh though as a standalone thing. I like the mad music.
I was probably more into pseudo-thing back then than I am now. But yeah, I mean, I think this is a cool curio to have in a collection.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, it's certainly an interesting game. I feel like a lot of the visual style of it is great.
It's a weird thing, the 3D graphics on the DS. They could be quite rough. And in this case, it's both rough and beautiful at the same time.
But you get the sense that this would... If Suda made a game that had this vibe, but wasn't so heavy on arbitrary mechanics and wasting your time, it would probably be quite successful and acclaimed. Because his writing is fun.
So good. Alright, cool. Another one in my favour.
Slowly getting out of my death sentence here.
I mean, you are still firmly in the death zone currently.
Okay, good. Good to know. But I think I've got a strong streak coming up.
And then one possible danger zone at the end is going to be interesting. So, exhibit H Matthew is Contact on DS. So, I bought this on the 2nd of April for £4.99.
Now, this is a game I know very little about, but isn't the little man in it your avatar on Twitter?
It is my avatar on Twitter. It was my reviews avatar in Endgamer. Because when I joined they were like, you need like a sprite to represent you.
And I didn't pick this because I particularly like Contact. I don't think it's an amazing game. It's quite a baffling RPG with some quite strange mechanics.
But almost like the Suda stuff, it has this amazing kind of character and a sense of style to it. This one, yeah, I'm going to put my hand up and say I've never actually finished Contact. That's how much I didn't get on with it playing it.
But it would feel churlish of me to execute you for something which I've used as my avatar for almost 13 years. Is that churlish?
I don't know. Well, the judge is making the rules here like a mad dictator.
Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to... I don't know.
I'm looking around the court, looking into the eyes of everyone.
Don't look at Wario.
I can see Wario wants me to do it. He's up for it. He's like guilty.
He's chanting guilty.
He just wants blood. That's all Wario wants.
He's chanting, and he's sick, and I don't know if I want to kind of humour him, really. The monkeys look sad, so I'm going to say not guilty.
Okay, good. Wario is furious, of course, and throws one of the monkeys. An act of aggression, unnecessary.
Okay, so exhibit I. This is where it gets interesting, because this could go either way. So I bought X-Men Origins Wolverine Uncaged Edition on April 11th for £2.99.
So I partly bought this as research for Best Games of 2009, because I wanted to talk about it a bit, because I knew it was one of the oddities of that year, that they made an 18-rated Marvel game, where Wolverine just goes around slashing dudes and blood goes everywhere, which is something you never see in the films. You do see it in Logan a little bit. So I thought I'd buy it and play it.
I didn't think it was very good. I think that actually if you compare this to action games of its time, like the higher-end stuff like Devil May Cry 4, I think Devil May Cry 4 holds up really well compared to something like this. This is quite rough, but in sort of magazine freelance parlance, Matthew, it's a great two-pager.
You make a bit of money, you finish it in six hours, you've got it done by Sunday night, and you can enjoy the rest of your evening. It's a classic, you're a staff writer, go review it kind of job. So that's this one, Matthew.
What does the judge make of it?
Yeah, I think you're right about where this fits in, is that kind of throwaway, six out of ten freelancers like it. I also think it's like the end of a certain era, or maybe an era that had already finished at that time, so maybe it's kind of more of a callback to just sort of quite childish violence. It's the kind of games that a 12 or 13 year old really wants their big brother to buy them.
You know, it kind of taps back into the kind of, you know, like the Mortal Kombat thing and the Soldier of Fortune. It's like needlessly violent, not in a very interesting way, but probably like gory enough in screenshots to kind of tempt people. I kind of have an affection for that sort of genre of games.
Like, they're not great, but I think they are quite key parts of like an adolescent gaming diet. You're right, it's not the best game, but I think I'm going to say, I'm going to say not guilty because, you know, it makes me think fondly of old bloodlust. I mean, really, I should say guilty because, you know, if I have such a bloodlust, you know, I can literally make a person be executed today, which would be rad.
I'm going to do the grown up thing and say not guilty.
Okay. Yeah. I know the judge just said rad about killing someone.
Well, sorry, I shouldn't give away. I mean, it would be awful and it would weigh heavily on me.
Okay, great stuff. Okay, good. In no way is this a sham trial.
So, yeah, I think we're about halfway through, Matthew. Got a few more here. I think you're going to enjoy these next few as well.
I mean, we're about halfway through. I will say you were still in the death zone.
Oh, okay. I think I might... It could go either way here, so we'll see how it goes.
But, okay, so exhibit J is Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword on DS, which I bought on April 15th for £5. Now, this is a weird game, because I thought this would be a 2D throwback game to the Ninja Gaiden games, but it's not that. It's like a 3D game.
You hold it like a book and you swipe the screen to perform sword attacks, making it a bit more similar to the Xbox 360 Ninja Gaiden games. I think I might have bought this because they remastered them early this year. That remastered sounded like it was a bit of a bust, unfortunately, because those original Xbox ones were exquisite, but you can play those on backwards compatibility.
But yeah, did you play this one, Matthew? Because it's a very strange game, a very strange spin-off to exist.
I did play it. I remember thinking this was okay. I remember thinking this was a...
Like, clearly some thought had gone into how to translate an experience into this quite unique hardware. I am such a sucker for book format DS games. Like, that instantly kind of gets me on board a little bit.
I remember this looking quite nice because it... I think it has the sort of... Or maybe, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but the sort of Ninja Gaiden-y sort of pre-rendered backgrounds.
Yeah, and the 3D characters actually look really good as well, considering.
That's the thing, it frees up a bit of heft for the character by doing that. Yeah, I can't remember if it was an amazingly satisfying technical experience as a fighting game, but I certainly don't remember it being terrible. I mean, I'm probably giving away too many easy shortcuts here to future purchasing decisions, but I think simply for being a book-held DS game, I've got to say not guilty.
Okay, yeah, £5 is a good price as well, I think, for some areas.
Yeah, I'm surprised, because that feels like it would be harder to get your hands on.
Yeah, I think it's because it's published by Ubisoft here, so there's loads of copies floating around. Yeah, I think the one criticism I'd level at this is that it can sometimes be a bit incomprehensible between movement and slashing the screen, but I will say that the act of slashing the screen at enemies feels really good. It feels like nice, kind of chunky combat.
And yeah, that's something I don't think I've really enjoyed in other... a phenomenon I've not really had in other DS games, so I think it's definitely got a place. Okay, another one in my favour.
So the next one, Matthew, I've not played it at all, but I know you would have played, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. So this is Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, which I bought on April 17th for £22. So another DS game.
I remember you didn't like one of the later Castlevania DS games when we discussed it on one of these podcasts. But what do you make of this one?
This one is brilliant. This is the best DS Castlevania by far, I think. Now, there is disagreement over this.
A lot of people like Order of Ecclesia, which is the one I don't really like. I think the problem with... Why?
It's fine. I think the problem with the other DS games is that Dawn of Sorrow was the first one, and it just... it lands so perfectly for me that they can't help but suffer afterwards.
I think the big thing in this is that it's, you know, very much like Symphony of the Night. It's just a big-ass castle, very satisfying to explore. Like, the actual construct of the world is really, like, coherent.
It really sells you on this one massive location. There's a little bit outside as you kind of come up to it, where the other games just get a lot bittier. And, you know, they may have more sophisticated action systems, but actually, like, the act of exploring a castle is super important to me in this series.
So I think Dawn of Sorrow is absolutely rad. A big, kind of, really deep sort of weapon system where you can get all kinds of different fighting styles. Loads of really good secrets.
Looks absolutely gorgeous. I mean, this team always made amazing looking sprite games. Yeah, I think this game's absolutely fab.
Okay, good. It looks fantastic as well. And these feel like games.
I just can't see them porting to other systems because they're on DS. It would take too much work. You can see why the GBA ones are, like, being rumored for a re-release.
But this would probably take Konami more work and I just can't see them doing it. So, yeah. 3DS, but as DS purchasers, yeah, they're good.
But I will say these games have become incredibly expensive to get hold of. Mm.
It's just they're good.
Yeah, exactly. Their reputation's grown and obviously Konami just stopped making them as well. So, all right, cool.
That's, yeah, nice to hear your take on that one, Matthew. So, exhibit L, this is a really interesting one and one that I think people asked us to discuss on a previous Best Games of X episode, but didn't come up for whatever reason. So, Silent Hill Shattered Memories on Wii, about 28th of April for £47.
All the Silent Hill games, including, like, Silent Hill 2 on PS2, which was a, you know, it was released in Platinum. It was, like, you know, dirt cheap for years and years. All go for, like, really, really high prices now because YouTubers have basically, like, stoked up the mythology of these games to far exceed their actual quality.
It's like, it's a really weird thing. But I was really curious what you made of this one, Matthew, because this is, like, considered a kind of cult favourite Wii game, but I understand that you're not as massive on it as some other people. Am I wrong about that?
Yeah, I'm not as massively into this and I, but it's a tricky one this. So whenever it comes up, it's sort of widely held as this cult classic, just like a great survival horror game. And, you know, every year or so there'll be a bout of excitement about this on Twitter.
And I kind of sort of hold my tongue a bit because it just feels sort of churlish to wander into that conversation going, well, I don't like it. And it's not that I don't like it. It just doesn't entirely work for me.
So the big problem I have with Shattered Memories is that it really clearly delineates between when you are in peril and when you aren't. So you're exploring the town and the gimmick in this one is that the town gets like frozen in ice. And that's when the monsters come out and you have to run away from them.
But the deal is if there is no ice, you know, and it's quite clearly a break, you know, a cutscene happens and it's kind of semi scripted. And it basically means if you're not in ice world, there's no monsters, which I think really undoes the tension of this. And then when you are in the ice world, it's always an escape sequence, which means you are running towards an empty bit of the level.
So all the monsters and interesting stuff is behind you and you don't actually see any of it. And I think that is just, I think that is a huge flaw with this game, that it either has no monsters or you can't see them because they're behind you. And so it's kind of theoretically scary.
I just don't think it's scary at all. But it is beautifully made. It's incredibly thoughtful.
It was written by Sam Barlow, went on to do her story and others. And this was a classic, someone really putting a lot of effort into a Wii game. I know it was also on PS2 and PSP.
It was clearly made for the Wii in terms of like remote functionality and everything. Very packed with interesting ideas. It has this sort of framing device where you're talking to a psychologist and the answers you give them affect things in the world.
And it also allegedly registers like how you play it and alters the story. So like if you focus on certain things, it will change elements of the story. I must admit I found that stuff kind of more interesting on paper than I did in the game.
Like the psychological depth of it is more clever than super obvious. Like you'd have to point out to me what the changes were. Like it just didn't have that effect on me.
So yeah, I completely get why people love this game because it's so packed with interesting ideas. But I think it is also a bit of a bust as a pure horror experience.
Yeah, okay. I'm gearing up to... I haven't played this yet.
I'm gearing up to play this a bunch of Wii games. And I've got my Wii U out and the sensor bar plugged in and stuff. So I will definitely give this a try.
I find this fascinating. This was made in my hometown of Portsmouth.
Yeah, it's word climax. They had a studio on basically a pier.
Yeah, it's Gunwolf Keys. Did you go there on a trip?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, wow, yeah. It's inside basically a shopping complex, which is quite funny. Just find it fascinating the idea you could live around Hampshire and make a game that's got like Akira Yamaoka music in it.
That's just like kind of wild.
Yeah, yeah, it is. I'd say like outside of the original team's games, it's definitely like the most interesting one they did when they started sort of farming out to the west.
There's a bumpy ride for Silent Hill around this time.
Yeah, I think I've got to say not guilty really, because like my personal problems with it, it's more just a question of taste rather than it being like a bad game.
Yeah.
So, yeah, that's a not guilty.
This one will also probably never re-release, and also, you know, because obviously the Wii stuff is like inherent to it. And also, I think the price will just keep going up over the years too, so it doesn't feel like a bad purchase to me. Yeah.
Okay, good.
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's certainly an interesting thing.
Okay, cool. So we've only got, I think, seven left now, so we'll fire through these. So, Exhibit M is Resident Evil 2 on PS1, Matthew.
I bought that on April 22nd for £16.95. I think this is because I think there was something up with how I couldn't get Resident Evil 2. Oh, yeah, we've talked about this before.
Resident Evil 2, you can't buy it on PS Vita unless you get it on the US store, I think it is.
Which basically means reformatting your Vita.
Yeah, which I couldn't be bothered to do. So I decided to just buy a PS1 copy and play on my PS3. I was, admittedly, I bought this around the time we did our Resi episode, so I was just in that headspace a little bit.
I never finished the Resident Evil 2. I think I might have finished the Leon campaign and not the Claire one, or the other way around, but it's been a long, long time. Had revisited these.
As we discussed, the remake is quite different to it, really, in terms of the feel and everything. So, yeah, a bit of a curiosity purchase, but a beautiful copy of it I got from CEX. I assumed they just put it in a new case or something, but it looked really nice.
It looked like a brand new game, basically. What do you make of this one, Matthew?
Yeah, I replayed this on Vita. I went through the FAF of reformatting and all that just before the remake came out, so I could have a bit more of an informed take, sort of refresh memories. Yeah, you know, it's a classic.
You can't really argue with Resident Evil 2. I still remember when this first came out. We didn't have a PlayStation, but I remember seeing a very brief clip of it on a TV show, and I think it was like the zombies pulling themselves out of the drawers in the morgue.
I remember just thinking, that is going to be the scariest thing ever. I couldn't imagine anything scarier than that at whatever age I was. Yeah, I think it holds up really well.
I don't think you can really argue with that.
Yeah, the price isn't bad either. This is another series that's gotten quite expensive to hoover up. Survival Horror, I think, is just such fertile ground for YouTubers that people like the idea of artifact kind of horror games.
Younger generations who weren't there at the time to actually play these. Plus, I did actually start playing the original Resident Evil on my PS Vita. That game holds up really well as well.
They're just fantastic games.
I've only ever played the original one as the remake.
Yeah, and I think someone pointed out they're both worth experiencing. I can absolutely see why, minus the terrible cutscenes and voice acting, the style of it at the time would have been so dazzling to players. It really is the ultimate collision of cheesy pop culture nonsense and genuine class.
It's a genuinely classy game, but about something quite trashy. That's what's fantastic about Resident Evil. I don't regret that one.
That's the energy of this podcast, too.
Yeah, basically. Talking about trash, it is like gold, basically. We have a few more then.
Exhibit N, Matthew, is another Matt Castle game, I think. Golden Sun Dark Dawn on DS. I bought this for £19 from CEX on May 15th.
I did start playing the GBA, original Golden Sun, recently. I thought it was pretty cool. Pretty cool RPG series with action elements.
Looks really nice. I think anytime there's a Nintendo Direct, someone fruitlessly says, make a new Golden Sun Nintendo, which they're never going to do. I was curious, Matthew, what you made of this DS one, which I don't know loads about, but I know is 3D, right, as well?
I really love this. I think I liked it more than most. The thing I love about this is that you have kind of these sort of summons, which the kind of combat sort of built around, that give you different combat abilities, and it's kind of turn-based combat.
That's all fine, but what I really liked is that the kind of summons you have also translate to kind of abilities in the real world, like action abilities, and there's almost a sort of a light Zelda element to it, like the, you know, the dungeons, you use your powers to kind of navigate and solve light puzzles, and it's just enough to push those dungeons above the usual layer of... It's kind of a problem I have with general JRPGs, is that, you know, the dungeons are just like endless corridors full of random battle encounters. There's very rarely any interesting like gameplay hook or angle to them.
But here, like, your magic powers do have a use in the overworld, and it sells you on this quite kind of sort of adventurous sort of spirit that this game has. That's what I really like about Golden Sun. I thought this did...
This did a really, really nice job. I thought this was great. I loved it.
Oh, okay, great. Sounds like another one in my favour there, Matthew.
This is definitely not guilty.
I know some people are less keen on it and some people who are keen on the Game Boy Advance games weren't as into the DS one, but I just thought it was... I thought it was class.
It's actually kind of weird that the series ends here because you'd think that this would be... This is such a golden era for so many Nintendo series that suddenly blow up on DS, but this is kind of an exception where it just sort of ends here.
Yeah, I might just guess it didn't do the numbers. I wonder if there's a lot of DS games which are kind of hangovers from the GBA period where they're like, well, of course we'll do a sequel to that. It was big on GBA, and then the character of the DS is so different.
And by the time you know that, you've already far enough that you're like, well, let's make these things. It doesn't really fit into how we talk about this console. Golden Sun did not get a lot of love for Nintendo in terms of conference time and stuff like that because they were too busy talking about Wii Motion Plus or whatever.
So it's just a game that didn't fit where they were, even though it's perfectly good. Great, even.
Okay, yeah, good stuff. Well, it certainly feels like another good addition to my DS collection.
Yeah, and one step further from the electrocutionist chair.
Cool, cool, cool. All right, then. So this is where the...
Sorry, that actually suggested that the person who runs the chair is called an electrocutioner, which I don't think is the thing.
Yeah, I don't think that's like you go to a careers fair when you're a student and they're like, hey, have you considered becoming an electrocutioner? And this is a picture of a man.
And it's like, well, it's an electricity-based executioner. They're like, oh, yeah, I definitely... It's just that.
Okay, this could really tip it either way, this one. So exhibit O is Sonic Colours on DS, which I bought on May 16th for £4. Again, who is sending these games out for such a low price?
How can you be bothered to go to the post office? Crazy. But I bought this around the time we did the Sonic episode.
I just wanted to kind of fill in some knowledge gaps. It was so little money. And the Sonic Colours games are considered probably the most acclaimed of the Nintendo era of Sonic games.
It's like perfectly fine to mix up the usual Sonic formula. It has very nice 2D art, I would say. And generally speaking, I think it's like another of those sort of 7 out of 10 DS Sonic games, really, Matthew.
But did you ever play this one?
I didn't. I only played the Wii game, which makes it feel unfair for me to put any kind of pressure on it.
Did you kind of accept that was a reasonably good Wii game?
Yeah, the Wii game is good. Like it's probably the best of the 3D Sonics.
Yeah, that's probably why they're remastering it this year.
Yeah, and it makes, that makes sense. The DS one, I just don't remember. I mean, if it had anything particularly special, probably I would remember it.
It's very difficult because there's like, I'm weighing up lots here. Let me, let me talk you through my thought process here. I'm weighing up a lot here as a judge.
You know, I'm thinking what's fair. Yeah, I'm thinking, you know, what's going to get people coming back to my court room?
What? Like a WWE pay-per-view or something?
Sort of. I want to make sure I put on a good show for the crowd. Because even though it's free to come in, like we do sell merchandise outside, it's one of those courts.
You know, just the drama for the listener.
Don't forget to pick up your shirt that says, I watched a man die in Matt Castle's courtroom.
My parents went to games court, and all they got was the whiff of death in their nostrils. For the sake of drama, let's say guilty.
Okay, I wasn't expecting that. If it was the Wii one though, it probably would have gone in my favour.
If it was the Wii one, absolutely fine. The DS one, I don't really know what I'm talking about, so that sounds like a good excuse to send the man to his death.
Okay, I guess I can't argue with that logic. All I can do is make my case for my final four games. So, Exhibit P is Lunar Nights on DS.
This was, I believe, the only Kazuhiro Productions DS game. It's kind of a follow-up to the Bokutai series. This was £22.49.
I would say it was one of the highest rated games in the system. Very acclaimed when you look at the DS on Metacritic. I saw this pop up and I think it was £80 something.
I was like, okay, that's interesting. I remember them talking about it at the time. Kind of like a shooter-y thing.
I've never played Bokutai. It always seemed conceptually flawed being in the UK, which is perennially overcast. But people seem to quite like it.
Bokutai hard mode.
Yeah, exactly. Go live in Sweden during the night time.
Yeah, wherever it is that Al Pacino is in insomnia.
Yeah, where is he in that? He's like in the north of... Is it Pacific Northwest, something like that?
Yeah. That's the thing. If Al Pacino had taken Bokutai with him in that film, he would have had a much better time, because even though he can't sleep, he would have ruled at Bokutai.
It's also the era of... That was the era of Bokutai too. So, yeah, a real oversight.
I'm surprised they didn't do that tie-in.
A real oversight by Christopher Nolan. So yeah, it's kind of an interesting game. I will confess I've not played it yet, Matthew.
But they took out the solar sensor thing, but basically, apparently, if you plug in the Bokutai GBA cartridge, you can bring that functionality back, which is quite a funny idea. So I thought this was an interesting curiosity purchase. I sort of stand by on that basis.
It has really nice art, the screenshots look really good, and felt like a good kind of like secondary DS game for my collection. So where do you stand on this one?
Yeah, I've got to put my hand up and say I haven't played this one either. But, you know, I remember thinking, oh, it's sort of a, you know, it lost its unique selling point a little bit. But like you say, you can connect it to the thing.
It is gorgeous. It's a really handsome game. I mean, purely, you know, this podcast is a very like Kojima friendly zone.
Everything except like everything except horny Kojima that we're friendly to basically.
Yeah, even then though.
Are we going to do our episode about Quiet? Ten Reasons We Love Quiet.
That's a piece of merchandise I'm selling outside a game school.
But a really bad like knockoff version.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm horny for Quiet. Yeah. Listen, it would be uninformed of me.
I mean, it's uninformed either way, but I'm going to say not guilty.
Yeah, I think this is definitely like one that I'm going to play in the next couple of months. I'm a DS. I've been cycling through these.
I've made a concerted effort to play a lot more of these for this episode. As people might have noticed, I've got thoughts on some of them. A mixture of like sort of oddball adventure games that kind of get in their own way with wacky dialogue and mechanics and yeah, just other kind of like weird DS oddities.
So, yeah. Okay, cool. In which case then, we come to Exhibit Key, Matthew, which is a bit of a hard turn here.
This is Alien Trilogy on PS1, which I bought for $4.99 on eBay. Can't remember why I bought this, but I put it straight to my PS3, played it. It's basically Doom with Xenomorphs and was acclaimed at the time.
And it might have been because they announced that Aliens Fireteam Elite game actually, which has big 7 out of 10 energy based on the reviews. But yeah, so I don't know if you ever played this one, but...
I haven't. You'll have to tell me all about it and in such a way that I end up liking it. So come on.
Okay, yeah, so it basically loosely adapts the story of the films and has the kind of usual alien FPS kind of mechanics of the little motion tracker going off and then them kind of like popping out of nowhere. I think the fact that it has this sort of like Doom style, sort of like old ass graphics works in its favour. It's considered a better game than the later kind of like more 3D-ish Alien Resurrection that released on PS1.
It's really, really straightforward. It's walking around levels and shooting aliens in the dark. And I think that is always quite a good formula for a game.
But this happens to be one of the better ways to enjoy that experience that exists in video games. There's obviously an increasing amount of bad alien games out there.
How does it handle alien only having one alien?
It's basically like it doesn't really delineate. The story isn't really a story. It's just a series of levels basically.
I think the Alien Trilogy thing is just maybe it's because Die Hard Trilogy existed and they thought what happened to that. But you're right. You can't really doomify the original Alien, can you?
Or Alien 3 really. That's not really a factor. It just feels like Aliens writ large really turned into an FPS.
It would be really interesting for someone to have one game which actually acknowledged the unique character of those three films and try to pay homage to that.
Yeah, this is not that game.
It's just not that game.
It's much more like Doom or Dark Forces in first person. But I do think it was definitely a win purchase, but it has lots of fucked up looking variants on the Alien. And I think just a good oddity from a weird era for this series where it was just turned into a commodified for action nonsense and merchandise.
You know what? Listen, you make a compelling case. Like I say, I haven't played this one.
I know, you know, I've read plenty of positive things about it. I'm going to say not guilty.
The Alien Queen, they do in this. I have not reached, by the way. I did watch a quick clip of it on YouTube.
It looks really fucked up coming out of the dark. It's like really a nasty sprite thing they made for it. Yeah, big Echo the Dolphin vibe.
And of course, the Alien Queen joins us in courtroom today.
Yeah, it's great to see her. She's wearing one of those I'm Horny for Quiet shirts.
Yeah, it's awkward though because on the other side of the courtroom, there's Ellen Ripley in the power loader.
Yeah.
It's kind of, that's a bit orcs.
Yeah, that's tough for everyone involved. So, yeah, wow. Okay, it's like Harvey Birdman this court basically, isn't it?
Okay, so, second to last game here Matthew. This is Fear on the Xbox 360, which I bought on July 20th for £2.75. So, first person shooter from Monolith.
Very straightforward like going through offices and shooting dudes, but the gunplay feels really nice. I remember this being like in early days, like pre-Halo 3. The Xbox had a weirdly good amount of FPS games early on.
I think that just became like the DNA of the original Xbox and that just carried on to 360 with horror elements as well and quite a nice physicality to the combat. I thought this was backwards compatible on Xbox One, but it's not, which is really weird because you'd think that this would be a game that they'd make available, right? But yeah, I don't know.
For some reason you can't, but obviously I still have an Xbox 360. It's plugged into my TV. I've played this a little bit before.
I don't think I ever owned it. I think I borrowed it from the office or something. But yeah, I thought I'd just play it because I want to do a bit of research ahead of a Halloween episode we've got coming up, Matthew.
And yeah, Fear on 360. Did you ever play it?
I played Fear on PC.
Nice, yeah. That would have been a good place to play it too, I guess. But I just fancy playing on my TV.
So what do you make of it?
Yeah, I mean, I love this game. Really great aggressive enemy AI. Just really punchy to fight.
I love the horror element because it's like super old fashioned scares. It's like jump scares and spooky J-horror stuff popping out of holes and things. Like, I don't think it makes any claims to being sophisticated, which is why it's good and actually works.
I loved Fear on PC. If that's indicative of Fear on 360, then this has got to be not guilty.
Yeah, this was a good port. And this is an example of a series that really loses the thread of what it's good at very quickly. The second one is very, it's got like mechs and stuff and it's just not the same thing.
Yeah, it got too wrapped up in the lore of its stupid horror verse with like Alma as this sort of horror figure. You know, it became very much about like her backstory and unpicking all that. And she was much more effective as just this like scary sprog kind of jumping out.
There's a really good jump scare on a ladder in this. I think I'll remember as like an old timer.
Yeah, like you say, it's not sophisticated. It's just like we watched three J-horror films in the early noughties and thought it'd be rad to have an FPS where she pops up.
Yeah, super simple. It's weird because settings wise, it's quite drab. It's like offices and things like that.
It doesn't do anything exceptional in that space, but it just feels so good that it kind of steps over that perfectly fine.
Yeah, between this and Condemned, you had some quite interesting games coming out of Monolith at this point. It's a shame they just sort of like, I don't know, I guess now they make Lord of the Rings games. What can you do?
Yeah, so I don't regret buying this. £2.75 is almost nothing as well. Nothing at all to just play this on my 360.
So yeah, what does the judge make of this one? Not guilty?
It's not guilty.
Okay, good. Is it even possible? Actually, maybe we should save that for the end, whether I've actually like, it's even possible for me to have turned it around at this point.
But last one, Matthew, is Exhibit S, Burnout 3, Takedown. I bought this on August 9th, which I think is just after we recorded the PS2 mini draft episode where you selected this for sports.
Very clever. Picking something which you know I just endorsed.
Well, this was one I only played a bit of at the time around a friend's house. I played a lot more of Burnout 2, actually, which is also very good. But £4.95 this on the original Xbox runs backwards compatible with 360.
Obviously, you know, arcade racing, whack the nitrous button, you know, have some nice crashes, use the after touch thing to turn them into super fun stunts and stuff. The most complete Burnout game of the original type of Burnout formula. So, Matthew, I guess this is a not guilty, right?
I mean, this is a shame because we could have had a really spectacular ending here. But you've saved, I mean, you've arguably saved the best till last, or one of the best till last. It's a great game.
This is the one the Burnout team themselves believe is like the fullest exploration of that idea. It's their favorite of it. Yeah, and it's just great fun at the time.
Just looked amazing. So, it's such a pizzazz, you know, there's such showmanship to this game that I really, really enjoy. It's big daft, really good fun.
Yeah, this is not guilty. It's not guilty as hell.
Yeah, yeah. I played a bit of it the other day and I was just like, oh, there is no modern equivalent to this, really. That's what's the bummer about it.
It's just like, of its time, I guess. But I don't know, people would still enjoy this if it still existed in this form, you know.
Yeah, well, there's always dangerous driving.
Yeah, is there a second one of those coming out at some point?
Well, they must be working on something. Yeah, I quite like the first one. And it doesn't have the same, like, you know, sort of scale to it because it's a much smaller team.
But the actual core, you know, mechanics of driving really fast and dangerously and the excitement of that, I think it nails really, really well. I just think that some people struggled to get past the fact that it is like visually a bit simpler and doesn't have the same level of just polish and expense.
Yeah.
But it's, you know, I actually thought the last one they made was pretty great.
Yeah, I think that it would help if the name was a bit less Alan Partridge Presents on VHS, Dangerous Driving. You know what I mean? Like, it's got that kind of flavor to it.
Like it's Crash Bang, what a video. It's got a bit of that vibe to it. Whereas Burnout is such a perfect word to describe that series.
That's a great name for a game, that is. Dangerous Driving is a little bit more of a hard sell. So, I don't know.
Yeah, maybe if a second one, if they just, you know, they've built a load of assets for that first one, they'll just amp it up and maybe it will get closer and closer to that Burnout experience. Like you say, it sucks and no one's really making it otherwise. But yeah, so we've reached the end, Matthew.
We got through a whole bunch of them there. Like I say, that's probably the end of Purchase Me for a while. You can see there that like I've only made three in the past like five months.
So it's slowing down a little bit because, you know, I'm double jabbed, baby, and going to restaurants, you know, I'm out there in the real world. So what's happened? What's the verdict from the judge?
So the numbers, I'm just tallying them up. So obviously, if you're into the minus numbers, you get executed. If you're into the plus numbers, you walk free.
But there's a chance that Wario might kill you out in the entrance hall.
Yeah, strangle me with one of the promotional T-shirts or something.
So that would be the twist at the end of the film if you do walk free. The final result, I can reveal, you have four points.
Oh, so not guilty.
Not guilty. The court celebrates, the monkeys are tap dancing, the Pikmins are, I don't know, they're carrying Wario out because he's just collapsed out of disappointment that he's not going to see a man die. Even Ellen and the Alien Queen are embracing.
Yeah, yeah, Pain has retrieved his wig and he's one of the little Pikmin broi over to him and that's good. So yeah, I'm shocked actually because I really thought those first few would actually properly kill it, but I do think that my taste in games is still reasonably good despite the odd flashpoint of complete nonsense.
Yeah, and they're very much like my personal kind of bugbear picks, so it's, you know, I imagine you would have won by more points if you'd had a more reasonable judge.
There's also the thing of like, I thought that A, that I do find it, you know, genuinely enriching to hear you talk about these old games I might have missed. I also think that DS is like the best format to collect for because of the such a vast range of games. So many of them actually released in Europe and even if they didn't, you can get them on import on eBay and stuff.
It's actually like a brilliant machine to collect for if you can avoid some of the ludicrous high prices for some particular games.
And the fake arts.
Yeah, exactly. Some of the point now where it's like put up or shut up for Akami doing and Ghost Trick and stuff. I'm not sure I can get into like spending £50 plus at a DS game.
I don't think that's very me. Yeah, it's just a bit too much. So we're staying excessive.
Yeah, I think so. But yeah, faster, a great little console. And yeah, that's why most of my picks come from that.
But yes, it was fun doing another game school with you, Matthew.
That was, yeah, glad, you know, as much as I give it the old big talk about how much I want to see an execution. You know, I'm glad that you live another day. Yeah, if only because this feels like, you know, quite a lucrative podcast format.
Yeah, I think so. The electrocution has been sent home unpaid. He only gets paid by the execution.
By the electrocution. Yeah. Oh, God.
So Paul went out for the electrocution.
Yeah. And he asked himself, why didn't I train in another field? Why did I only train in this field out of university?
You've got to remember, this whole trial, he's been cranking that wheel to power it up. That's tough. He's been playing a DS minigame for a solid hour.
Think of that guy's wrists.
Yeah. But this guy's been training it for years, Matthew. He's been stealing radios and GTA Chinatown Wars for like a decade now.
He prepared for this. Okay, good. Shall we take a short break then, Matthew?
And we'll come back with our thoughts on Deathloop and No More Heroes 3.
Welcome back to the podcast. So in this section, we've got a few listener questions to go through, but we're also going to talk a bit about Deathloop and No More Heroes 3. Deathloop, first of all, Matthew.
I've been playing this. I've played seven hours of it on PS5. I have Deathloop in my house, which is amazing.
So Arcane Studios has made this first person game set, a time loop on an island, and you basically have to kill all these targets in one day in order to break the loop. I think there are seven in total. And yes, they're called visionaries.
And in this preview code, I basically did the first stretch of the game. So Matthew, what are you kind of curious about with this game? Where should I start with discussing it?
Well, I'm kind of interested in like, what first stretch sort of means, because in my head, this is just a giant clockwork sandbox. Does it actually have like an introduction?
Yes, there is, the way it starts basically means that you have nothing, and you are just trying to figure out what's going on. And then over time, you get this, you can perform a series of objectives to get to the point where you're ready to like take on the loops properly. So, but later on you get Reprise, which is an ability that lets you die twice before you actually die, which is very key to your strategy in this game.
Sometimes dying can be part of your strategy, but then you'll come back to life. And you'll also collect a resource called Residuum, which you can use to infuse your gear. You spend a bunch of it basically, you can keep a gun or a power or like a weapon trinket between playthroughs.
And over time, you're accumulating like a vast arsenal of stuff you can sort of depend on. So the time loop thing is more punishing at first than it ends up being.
Right.
And to get the powers in the game, they're called Slabs. You have to go and kill one of the visionaries. Yeah.
And then you have to spend a bit of Residuum to keep the slab between playthroughs. And these are your sort of like Dishonored style abilities, like Shift, which lets you do the Dishonored kind of like movement stuff. And Carnesis, which is kind of like thwacking an enemy with a giant tentacle or something.
It's like a, you know, a telekinetic physical attack. And then you've got stuff like Aether, which turns you invisible briefly. So for a bit of a stealth approach.
Havoc, which I think like makes you more powerful briefly and makes you take less damage. So yeah, quite a lot going on in terms of powers and stuff. And at first, it feels very overwhelming, Matthew, trying to like keep track of what's going on.
And because there are four areas to explore at four different times of day, there are technically like 16 variants, 16 levels total, you know?
Oh, yeah. I was going to ask actually, like how different are they at different times of day? Is it just like lighting, or do they actually change kind of what's going on and?
They're very different, because the thing is that you might go to a place, just pick it randomly, and like, you know, nothing might happen, but you might find a few clues and stuff. But later on, you'll find an objective that makes you realize there was something you needed in that time period, but you just didn't realize it as a player, because you didn't know what you were looking for. This game, there's a massive part of this game, is about like creating a kind of breadcrumb trail for you to follow and just being like, well, I know that this person does this at this time, and I know that this thing is meant to happen at this time.
So what if I go here first and do this? And that's like a massive part of it. Yeah, things like enemy placements change massively.
There are like events that will happen only at specific times. It definitely feels like the same space, I would say, but they change things like the weather as well, and obviously the lighting. So yeah, a big variety.
There are some things that one area might change over the course of a day, and then at the end of the day, it will be a completely different state to how it started.
That's interesting.
Yeah, it is. It's a weird one, because they don't want to spoil anything about the story at all.
Yeah.
So I'm being very tentative with how I talk about...
Yeah, no, I was kind of interested, like, you know, I guess that was sort of tied into my first question, like how on earth you embargo something like this, where, you know, in theory, you could see so much of the game from like minute one, if you so chose. But, yeah, I guess this is the thing to sort of discover as you play it. In the actual set, when you were in an area in one of the time periods of the day, is there like a time limit?
Is time moving in real time? Or is it more like a Hitman level, kind of just a sort of a forever place?
It's, well, in Hitman, occasionally, there are timed levels, right? Like Paris, where things happen at different times.
Oh, yeah, I guess certain things don't loop. Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
Yeah. So, but this seems to be immutable. So you get there and then everything's kind of as it will be, constantly, it doesn't change.
So you can just go and explore and stuff. There might be a couple of exceptions to that, but I don't, for the most part, I think you can just take your time. You can like kill every enemy in the environment.
You can go explore every building that you can want to explore. You can stay for as long as you like, basically. It's just that when you leave, time moves forward.
Yeah. So you've got time to make it. Yeah, because my concern with this is that you are going to constantly be up against it, and it was going to be more of like a speed running exercise.
Yeah, it's definitely not that. You can be as considered as you want. You can take your time to go around the environment and try not to get caught by enemies.
So something I talked about my Tech Radar preview for this is that I think it's much more of a shooter than Dishonored is. In fact, it definitely is. Some players will try and play it stealthily.
There are ways to do that. You get a nail gun early on, which is obviously meant to be some kind of quiet kill stealth weapon. I will say that the first one I got didn't seem to take out enemies on a headshot, so I thought it was a little bit pointless.
So I switched that for a shotgun. But later on, you'll find a better version of the nail gun, which will take out an enemy on one shot silently. So you can play it as a stealth game eventually.
But I would say that from the sheer volume of guns they give you and the fact that you don't have loads of powers to begin with, you do end up playing it like a shooter that happens to be like, have a stealth system baked into it.
Right.
It feels like a lot of the videos they've been showing have been focusing on the action right. Just like hop in this building, hop out of here, shoot this guy. I love that kind of like Dishonored style speed run stuff that you see, where it's a lot more violent.
So yeah, it's a really interesting game. It's a bit of an acquired taste. I wonder what Dishonored fans will make of it.
I think the fact that it's more of a shooter might prove divisive, but I think it is a good shooter. The guns feel nice.
Do you, you know, with that kind of slightly punchier kind of action focus, do you still get a chance to explore? Does it still feel like a kind of a classic arcane world in terms of like, you know, the kind of the nuance in the environments and things like that?
Oh, yeah, like for sure. It's like beautiful looking sort of biomes, as it were. The levels look really, really nice.
It is genuinely interesting to see how one area of the map might change over the course of a day, how one door will be open at a certain time of day that isn't open later on. That sort of thing. Like there are different places that will be open at different times, which is really cool.
I like that. Yeah, the detail is certainly there. I think that if anything, it requires you to be more careful of making sure you don't miss a clue or like a document.
Pretty much everything you find in the world is not just for colour. It's about leading you to another potential clue to get you closer to your goal. And that's really interesting because there was a room that I had entered many times over and hadn't noticed one document that was on the floor or something.
And I read it and it was like it put another clue in my objectives to kind of follow basically, another place to go at another time and try and learn something about that place. So it rewards you being careful and paying attention to those details.
That's cool.
Yeah, it goes to a lot of pain as well to tell you who the different visionaries are to give you like a breakdown of their personalities and stuff. They feel like big characters in the world, which is nicely done. Yeah, there's only one level.
So the way they got around the, you know, not spoiling it, is they only gave you one level to capture basically, which is you go to a location called Carls Bay. It's kind of like a bit of a rundown sort of port area. And there's this sort of like kind of preacher style woman called Harriet, who's in a hanger, sort of delivering some kind of sermon in the hanger.
She's like in a kind of like a little sort of cockpit that's protruding from like another room. She's sort of standing in this little cage cockpit area, delivering the sermon to all these dudes. And she's got like, if you get caught, she's got like a little gas trap thing next to her that she'll activate.
The first thing I did was try like snipe her from, from like a vantage point up high in this hanger. And I missed. And so she activated the gas and I thought, okay, I've completely fucked it.
But I did after like getting to a massive firefight with all the people, the other NPCs in the hanger, she goes into this little safe room. And there are trip mines in there. And I got into a firefight with a couple of her bodyguards.
And then one of them accidentally tripped the mines and blew her up as well as the two guards. So I don't know if the game intended to do that, but it considered it a valid approach. And the thing is that you can go kill these targets over and over again.
So it's not enormously significant how you kill them once. The whole point is to how do you figure out how to kill all of them in one loop? So yeah, quite interesting.
And there was definitely, definitely another way I found to go in at least one other way to go and take out Harriet. That was, you know, much more careful than the way I did it. I was just being impatient.
And also I didn't want to spoil what that other way was for players, because again, I'm very frightened of embargo details, Matthew.
Is she in different places in different time periods?
I feel like your whole journey in this game is trying to figure out how they're all going to be in one place or two places or three places. I don't exactly know based on those seven hours, but it definitely feels like that's what it's going towards. It's like, you know, this is this is just the first time you'll kill this person.
And yeah, you come to see and if you kill a target more than once, you can upgrade the power that you take from them. So there's an incentive to go do it multiple times. I've killed, yeah, I've killed one target three times, for example, and getting more efficient at each time.
So which is quite good because there's a bit of mastery there too. You get better at doing each time and more efficient.
How's the like rival assassin?
So in our playthrough, we're playing a single player mode. So she was AI controlled. She turned up three times in my first seven hours.
She's quite a good mechanic. I remember I was in an area with no objectives and I was just kind of wandering around the thought, okay, it's a bit... I've kind of like wasted a bit of time here, but I'll just farm some Residuum.
Then I'll leave. Then she turned up and like just started shooting at me. And I was like, oh, that's quite cool actually that I can, you know, you think you can think you're safe.
You can think it's very quiet. You've cleared out a map full of enemies, but then she'll turn up and it's like, okay, it's a bit... now it's a bit tense.
She's like reasonably easy to kill, I would say, at least in a single player. But I can totally see how a fully powered up human opponent could be like devastating in that. So there's an interesting risk reward to that.
I must admit, I'm really excited about doing it as a player, about going into other people's games. It's the ultimate like, trolling sort of thing. I'm assuming though this game has...
something to regulate. Regulate it though, so you can't... you don't have Juliana coming into your game like every 10 minutes or whatever, because otherwise it would be an absolute pain in the ass.
But as a kind of like...
Presumably, like as you play it, you'll know certain times and places that other players are gonna be like bottlenecked. You know, your knowledge of the world that you build up by playing as the hero, you can then apply as the assassin.
I don't know, this... you will... the game gives you reasons to go to every place every time, basically.
Yeah, so it could be... it's got a lot of potential, I would say. It definitely feels like the missing piece of the preview...
the preview build is not seeing how that works. But she's still a good like single-player threat for sure, and you can't... it's not just killing her.
You have to like unblock some kind of signal, go across the map and unblock a signal in order to reactivate your exit in the level, basically. But yeah, it's quite interesting. It's more of a detective game than I thought it was going to be.
And less of a time loop game. Like less of a... I guess what I mean by that is less of a roguelike, you know.
It's not really a game about dying and starting again and changing your strategy. It's more a game about like, you know, knowing the end of the day is coming. So what will I achieve in this day that I can then pick up again tomorrow and and then like start, you know, start again.
So yeah, intriguing Matthew. I'm unsure what players will make of it. I think it's...
they've definitely taken some risks with it, which I admire. But a bit of a bit of a different flavor to Dishonored that's built on some of its bones, you know.
Yeah, exciting. I cannot wait to play it.
Yeah, it should be good. So Matthew, you have been playing No More Heroes 3. We had code sent to us by Nintendo via Heaven Media.
Thank you very much for that. We really appreciate it. And so Matthew, you've been playing that.
What's the deal with this one? I was fascinated to see it got four and eight out of tens, that kind of range. And I thought, fantastic.
This is definitely a pseudo game. So, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, it's like No More Heroes 1 and 2. It is about a series of boss fights that you are climbing the ranks. This time it's a load of aliens who have arrived.
I think that the story ties into Travis Strikes Again, which was the kind of weird mid game that they made, the sort of smaller indie thing, which I actually haven't finished. So some of the stories lost on me a little bit. Yeah, I didn't really know what to expect with this one, because in my head, No More Heroes 1 and 2 kind of come before a kind of a slight change in Suda51's work, where it gets a little more, a little bit more, I would say kind of maybe like clean cut in a way.
And I think No More Heroes games are a bit more of a kind of crossover from like early weird Suda and sort of modern, slightly more kind of conservative Suda. So the idea of him going back to this world, you know, I was intrigued to see kind of which version of him we'd be getting. It's pretty wild.
It's actually kind of... It's been a while since I've played a Suda 51 game, and I think my favourite thing about this new one is just being reminded of all the stuff that I do like about his stuff, which is the kind of mad sort of stylistic choices, the kind of the fourth wall breaking, the hyper violent cut scenes. It's like super obnoxious in a way that games kind of aren't that often anymore.
Really indulgent, but in a sort of self indulgent, but in a really fun way. I kind of missed it and I kind of missed him. Like, you know, the mad interface, all the weird kind of buttons and prompts, like just like leaving, you know, just just going, you know, button prompts in this kind of flood the screen with just like hundreds of words for the button prompt and things like that.
It's really hectic, buzzy and exciting. And yeah, like kind of interesting as a kind of combat experience. I think it's probably the best of the No More Heroes, it feels to me.
Like it's simplified a bit. He's got rid of the high-low stance. He's just got like strong and weak attack.
But there's sort of a timed dodge to get like a little burst, a sort of bayonetta-ish sort of slow-mo. And there's like a selection of special powers that you can drop at certain times sort of like a drop kick and things like that. It feels super fast and poppy.
Like the enemy types feel a bit more interesting. Like it feels like there's lots of different aliens that you're fighting. And the kind of combat feels a bit more interesting around that.
So like technically, it feels kind of super engaging. It has this weird technical thing where in the fight, it's quite smooth. It's like 60 frames and quite fast and quite gorgeous because it's got all the hectic pseudo fruit machine and the death blows and it's shrieking and there's all lights and sounds exploding.
That stuff's rad. But then when you go into the open world, like it's such a technical mess, which obviously sucks, but it does make the fights feel like super lush when you're in them, which isn't intentional. I swear, like if he could get the world running smoothly, he would.
You know, I think it would be pretty mad to kind of hobble your game like that. But like, you know, the open world is like rough as fuck visually. Like it's like a horrible draw distance, a horrible frame rate.
I've basically be going around on foot because getting on the motorbike is just, it's just gross.
Is it worse than the first one?
It's been a while since I've played the first one. Probably not. Similar to though.
Like it's kind of, it's, it's kind of audacious for something that's sort of ropey in this day and age. I mean, you know, when you see the technical breakdowns people have done on YouTube and stuff, and they're like, when it's in handheld mode, like the resolutions like 240p or something, like it's, it's wild as a technical experience. At the same time, kind of, who cares?
I mean, with the pseudo games, like if you're going to get really hung up on that, and that is going to stop you from enjoying it, I don't know that this was ever particularly for you in the first place.
Yeah, you were never, you were never playing his games, basically.
No, I'm like, I've seen some people who are like, you know, who go sort of go the other way, and they were saying like, you know, I'd be sad if it wasn't technically fucked, and you'd be like, well, that's mad. You're clearly insane. But, you know, I'm of the, I can kind of put up with this because it's so interesting.
Like, I will take a big, messy, interesting thing over a big, polished, boring game for sure anytime. And that is like the essence of him. The boss fights are like tremendous.
The enemy designs are great. There's lots of like weird gimmicks and twists. It's funny.
I find it funny. You know, it's very puerile and, you know, it's mostly just him snarling, you know, tons of swear words at everyone. But it makes me laugh.
I love how violent it is. It's really childish. Yeah, I just, I don't know.
Like, I just play it. It's been a long time since I've played one and two. Two I like less than one.
But this, like I'm already like super into it. I'm just having a really, really great time with it. I love the tone of it.
I love the music, its style. Like I just, I don't, maybe my tastes have kind of sort of, you know, they're a bit more set in stone now than they were back then. And, you know, I like this kind of, you know, I'm fully on team kind of rough and charming.
So, you know, it maybe resonates even more. But yeah, it's great, really, you know, exciting, proper No More Heroes sequel. What a cool thing.
Yeah, like, you know, more than a decade later.
I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, like there's some stuff in it as well that is like, I guess it's like really beautiful, like hand animated opening sequence and things like that. Like there's lots of weird little side things, weird little mini games, twists in the boss battles, strange kind of puzzle mechanics that come out of nowhere.
You know, I've only done a couple of them as well. So like there's there's plenty of weird stuff to come. I think the only thing I was a little unsure of is it's changed the format where there's now not like a bespoke level before the boss.
You kind of go around the city, sort of warping to these like self-contained arenas, where you sort of do kind of qualifying fights with aliens. And once you've racked up enough of that qualifying kind of currency, you then just go and fight the boss. So it's not like you go to a location, there's a level and then it ends with a boss fight.
And some of those levels were quite fun in the older games. I kind of liked the little stories they told, the locations they took you to. So it maybe feels like even bittier than it did before.
Whether that's like irks me more as I play the whole game, I don't know. I'll be waiting to see. Currently, I don't mind it as much, but that's the one change.
I'm a little like, hmm, sort of, is this right? Is this good? Lots of really, really long, excessive conversations about the films of Takashi Mike as well, which is very, very indulgent.
But, you know, if the sound of that really turns you off, probably don't play this.
Okay, yeah, yeah. Is it like big on references to like other games as well? That seemed to be like a thing they were kind of doing in Travis Strikes Again.
Is that part of this?
Yeah, definitely like films and games, like it opens with like a big kind of like alien riff. Yeah. But, you know, packed with all that stuff.
It's, you know, it's sort of, it's No More Heroes, you know. It's got all, it's, you know, it's incredibly self-referential kind of like artificial place. I will say like it references the other games quite a lot and the characters quite a lot.
It assumes like, for example, that you have played Travis Strikes again. That seems quite key to it. So probably play that before this.
That's quite a big ask, actually. I hadn't considered playing that, but I think it's often in the Steam sale, that one. So I'll look out for it.
Yeah. Yeah. But it's, yeah, it's just, yeah.
It's lively and fun and sort of, I don't know. It's weird. I played a bit of The New Ratchet and Clank this week on PS5.
I bought a pre-owned copy of it. And that is a game which is like sort of technologically kind of about as zippy and clean and polished as you can be. But man alive, it is so boring.
It is so boring compared to something like No More Heroes 3. Like it's just, I wish there were, you know, more people in that kind of pseudo-51 space who are making these big kind of like sort of big weird swings that are kind of hopeless in so many regards. But like the few places they do land, they just, you know, they sort of cement in your memory like instantly where Ratchet and Clank is just this big like polished pudding, you know.
Well, I mean, you know, the idea that you would consider a big polished pudding to be a bad thing Matthew is preposterous to me. I know you love a good pudding.
Well, I love pudding. Yeah, that's a terrible choice of words. It's just like, I tell you what, Ratchet and Clank, it's like plodding perfection, you know.
And you're like, yeah, okay, fair enough. But this is like, I don't know, this is the real deal.
I saw that Joe Scribble's liked Ratchet and Clank, Rift Apart. Do you consider that as a betrayal as a former editor?
Not at all. I just, that was, this isn't a Ratchet and Clank podcast, obviously. But the thing, I can't get over how shit the characters are.
The writing is terrible. It's so babyish. Like, and it's just not, and I know that's not aimed at me, but it feels like a game aimed at eight year olds.
That's the thing I don't really understand when peers are like really into it. Like, be into the action by all means, but the world is like, it's like the worst Saturday morning cartoon. I just don't get it.
It's not knowing. It's not ironic. It's not surreal, interesting in any way.
That's the thing which bugs me about Ratchet and Clank. It's just a cackling villain. He's just so lame.
Like, whenever Doctor Nefarious or whatever he turns up, you're just like, shut the fuck up. You know, I hate that guy. But it's just not aimed at me.
Yeah. Okay. That's fair enough.
Yeah.
But this though, you want to see like an alien just chop off loads of heads endlessly in cutscenes and everyone sprays blood like giant, like 20 foot fountains. This is the game for you.
Okay. Good stuff. Yeah.
I can tell I'm going to like this. It's going to be a game I put on my Christmas list.
I think it's great. Like I fully expected it to be terrible because I think, you know, I think he has been a bit all over the place for a while.
Yeah.
But I'm like, oh no, this is good. And it doesn't feel fake. You know, he could do a tribute act to himself.
And I think it feels like authentically shoddy in a way, which I haven't seen from him in a while. And that is an endorsement.
Yeah. No, that's just in screenshot for me. It looks exactly like the game I want it to be.
So, yeah, I'm so pleased he's made it and that people can play that entire series on Switch. That's really cool.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Cool. All right then, Matthew, let's close out with a couple of reader questions.
So they're both quite long. And as ever, they're tied up in our very strange universe of stuff on this podcast. So, number one, hey, lads, thanks for providing me with hours of enjoyment as I commute up and down the M1.
Really love what you do, especially the Daft episodes where you're both CEOs of your own studios. I was just listening to your handheld console episode and had an idea I wanted to share. We've already explored how disastrous your planning is for a press conference, but what about a whole physical event akin to Gamescom Pax 43?
How would Big Sammy Holdings or Matt Castle Productions entice gamers out to a physical two-day event again? Your picks could be your three paid-for influencer slash celebrity endorsers. Fucking Randy Newman is going to come up again.
I just know it. The one big experience that the convention offers, i.e. cosplay competition, VR arcade integration, etc.
What's in the welcome pack that comes with each booth? What would be on your panel schedule? And I'm sure you can come up with better ones.
I hope you're both keeping well and congrats on the podcast success. That's from Jimmy Bowers, who also left us a review on Apple Podcasts. So thank you very much.
Matthew, what is the Matt Castle Productions physical two-day event? First of all, what's it called? Do you have a name for it?
Oh, I don't have a name for it.
Yeah.
Oh, man, I should have thought of a good name. I mean, it would probably be like, like I'm quite literal with my with my titling of things. Productions is bad.
It's got to be a similarly bad name.
I think it should be Matt's Castle and then like brackets productions.
Oh, well, I do love a bracket.
Yeah, or something where it's like something and then brackets. It's a games convention.
Yeah, I think for me, I'm just going to go with Big Sammy Fest 2021.
Oh, yeah.
You need a vaccine passport to get in. I'll just make that very clear upfront.
We're pro jab on this podcast. I want to make that very clear. And we're pro people not dying.
So, yeah, that will be on.
Unless it's game score.
Yeah, I think we're pro people not dying will be on the program you get when you come into the convention center. Yeah, that's like our slogan. What about your paid for influencer or celebrity endorsers, Matthew?
I feel like I've got to be true to my conference. Yeah. So like people have seen the conference.
They're going to expect Barack Obama. Obviously, also that gets in like the legitimate press because people will just be interested in what that guy's up to. So again, I still think that is sound business practice.
Take a break from producing Netflix shows.
I was thinking like a whole like a obviously Randy Newman, of course, but like a hologram.
Okay, right.
So it's like if you're not into Randy Newman, okay, you know, if you can imagine such a thing, you're still probably just dig seeing like a really good hologram.
Right.
So that that works on two levels.
Yeah.
And finally, I thought I'd hired John Mulaney because he hosted your conference.
Oh, my God. That's so fucking shitty. How dare you, sir.
And it will look like he switched sides, even though it's just a paid gig. It will look like he's in somehow endorsing me. So that's what I'd do.
I see. So the hologram is of Randy Newman, is that right?
Yeah.
Is that because he the real Randy Newman was too injured from the E3 conference to come? Yeah.
I mean, I don't think the real Andy Newman, as you know, is suing that Castle Productions because we hurt him in that car accident.
Yeah.
So this is just like a static image of him. Because we have like we own anything that happened to him while he was during the conference. We own all that imagery.
So it's a hologram of him falling out of a car.
That's great stuff. Yeah.
So it's like a free-falling Randy Newman hologram.
When you walk in, it collapses on you, the hologram. And it's like you were really there. OK.
Good. So if you're taking something from me, I'll take something from you. Shootakumi is coming to mind.
Oh wait, no, he works for you, doesn't he? Shit, he can't do that.
But he's literally an employer.
Yeah, just like Agent 47, who's also on the board. OK, fine. I will bring the Pikmin in the jacket from Games Court.
I've survived that. I'll bring them along. I think people will find the Pikmin very cute and that would have that would have its own appeal.
It's tough with influencers and celebrity endorsements because I don't those don't get me excited as a person. I probably bring Henry Cavill because he like builds PCs and people think it's very hot that Superman makes like big computers. That sounds like a bad like the Sun headline, doesn't it?
Superman makes big computers. Yeah, so I think Henry Cavill is like a good show. Obviously, he's Geralt of Rivia as well.
Maybe I can awkwardly make him sit on the in a bath on the on the stage.
He's like, is this really cold and I'm wrinkling. Can I get out?
And I'm like, no, we paid you for two days. You have to do it.
So I've got to sit here for two whole days. Go home at six.
And I think like what I'm going to do is try and steal a bit of your thunder and invite Michelle Obama to my conference.
Interesting.
Yeah, I think it will suggest some like tension in the relationship like that they're they're quite split on Matt Castle Productions as a prospect. She's prepared. She's prepared to back its like nearest rival.
So yeah, then we got some red Pikmin in the jacket, Henry Cavill and Michelle Obama. Perfectly normal, normal all day at Big Sammy Fest 2021.
I wonder which of those three will have the biggest cues for all that.
Also, will I have to vaccinate the Pikmin? I don't really think about that. Okay.
What's the one big experience that the convention offers, Matthew? I suppose the virtual Randy Newman kind of works for that.
Yeah. I mean, that's already exciting. I feel like most people have got their money's worth just seeing a hologram of a falling Randy Newman.
The gimmick is that I've imagined it more as an E3 stand, I guess, is that it tries to recreate the Games Journal experience of E3 and Gamescom. So it's a lot more like the person, like each guest has like a sort of slightly harangued PR who looks after them. There's like a little seating area.
You get to eat some lukewarm mini burgers. You get to like get quite stressed because you can't find a Wi-Fi password. That's a key part of it.
And get led into a series of white shapeless box rooms to see quite sort of tired shootakumi doing presentation on different games.
Just shootakumi and no one else.
Well, and my other developers, but shootakumis. I feel like it's really the headline act.
Yeah. Yeah. I suppose I should probably lead into my stock of developers for this one.
You can come play Hollow Knight Silksong at my convention.
Why are you always leaning on this? I really feel like you've been dining out on Hollow Knight Silksong.
What are the two times it's come up, including this? Yeah. Well, you know, it's the game people want to play.
I mean, what a big draw that is.
What if it's a bust? If that game comes out and it's pure seven out of ten, oh my God.
How wrong can they get it? It's just a Metroidvania, you know, like a sort of... I'm sure it'll be fine.
Yeah. So yeah, I suppose I need something bigger than that. What else do I have?
So obviously we own Rockstar Games, Big Sammy Holdings. So what's going to happen is there'll be a car you can get into and a man will come and carjack that car from you. It's the GTA carjack experience.
That's just traumatic.
Well, no, you'll get thrown onto a crash mat. Like there'll be no physical injuries.
That's still not good. I don't want to be thrown on the ground of any sort.
Well, I mean, I personally think...
In my leisure time.
I think the combo of that and Hollow Knight Silksong makes this a damn good convention.
I just think... I think any event where no matter the circumstances, you have to pick yourself up off the ground, something bad has happened.
Yeah, but I mean, you know, we're seeing that through the prism of being larger gentlemen where it's harder to get up.
You really think your company is going to appeal to small men?
Well, we hadn't really thought about our demographics by body size. Oh, big men. It's not like, what, do you think big Sammy Holdings rules out people who aren't big?
Is that your suggestion?
A lot of hefty dudes getting shamed by a carjacker.
I suppose also, here's another thing we could do, right? We've bought Kazuma Productions, right? So Hideo Kazuma is going to have different film people on stage all day doing talks with them.
What he wants to do more than anything else is talk about films. So we'll just do that. So you can come see Kazuma on stage too, be caught in a pretend carjacking, and meet some real-life Pikmin in a coat.
So I don't know, fun for the whole family, question mark? Who can really say? So yeah, okay, good stuff Matthew.
What's in the welcome pack that comes with each booth?
I've only got a USB stick in the shape of Phoenix Wright's pointing arm.
I thought you were going to say some Renny. That seemed like it would be good for you. Oh, that would have been good.
But when the day comes, you've already taken them all out of the bags because you've needed Renny so bad.
Yeah, the whole thing should be sponsored by Renny. That's a really good shout. But I think you have to have a themed USB stick because that is primarily the swag you get.
In which case then, my USB stick has a picture of Hollow Knight's song on it and that comes with each one. And Matt Castle is furious because he thinks I'm leaning on that too much. That dials up the rivalry.
He releases a Twitter rant video about Silk's song beforehand, going, it's going to be a pure 7 out of 10. Fuck Big Sammy Holdings.
I'll get John Mulaney to write it so it'll have some good jokes and Obama to perform it so it'll go really viral.
But no one will pay attention because I've got a naked Henry Cavill in a bath on my stage, a cold bath, in front of an audience of thousands.
They're like, oh, we regret to inform you on the second day that Henry Cavill has hyperthermia.
Yeah, he's now in a warm bath at home trying to recover. Okay, good. God, that got so weird.
Okay, so yeah, welcome back. Yeah, I've got a Harlem Night Silk Song USB stick, mostly just to annoy Matthew Castle. So what would be on your panel schedule?
I've really done mine, I suppose, with the Kojima thing, Matthew. Have you got any ideas for yours?
I mean, yeah, outside of just Shikutakumi showing off my amazing Smash Brothers, but with the cars from Forza in it. Yeah, that's basically it.
Yeah, okay, good. I hope you will see it. I don't know why we decided to run them both on the same weekend, but we have, so that'll be fun for whoever goes.
See you at the Excel Center, I guess. Okay, good. Do you want to read out this one, Matthew?
Greetings. Your recent Zelda episode was great. Glad to hear in the subsequent episode that it was well received.
Don't tell Alice of the alabaster titan fame, but I need this podcast too. That's a reference to the Electronic Wireless Podcast show, which is the RPS podcast. As much as I enjoyed them in the moment, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks burnt me out on Zeldas, in no small part because of that handholding you guys brought up at one point.
As a result, neither Skyward Sword nor Twilight Princess has ever touched my Wii. Except for backup purposes. I'm pretty psyched to play them both now though, as it sounds like they're both heavy on dungeon puzzling, but place more trust in the player.
The burnout's had time to cool, I figure. Thanks for the excellent breakdown of the best of the series. Cheers, Particles.
Side note one. When you mentioned Zelda's weird owl in the Steam Deck episode, I 100% heard that the game has weird owl in it. The popular musical comedian.
Which was confusing, yet somehow plausible for a hot second there. So many urban legends around those games. Side note two.
MCP, more popularly known today as the official stylization of Matthew Castle Productions, was also the nickname of the Master Control Program. Rogue AI and the main antagonist of 80s cult classic video game film Tron. Coincidence?
Yes. Bonus question for potentially hot takes. Link and Mario want essentially silent protagonists.
If one ignores their cartoons, how do you feel about Mario's rise to incessant jabbering in his games these days versus Link's wordlessly shouty approach? I hope this holds up post-Spirit Tracks. How about versus Samus' monologue and primal death scream approaches?
Oh, she screams when she dies. Right. Does Mario talk that much?
Not really. He just sort of makes like little one-off noises and words, right? He doesn't, you know, have conversations.
He's like excited because he's jumping.
Yeah. Woo-hoo! And all that stuff, you know.
Yeah, and all that. But I'd say that's quite key to his character as well. Like, I like that, that he does that when he's jumping.
It sells me on how fun he is. I'm having fun. He's having fun.
Yeah. What would you have us put?
We're all having fun.
Would you have us put Charles Martin out of business? What a sicko. Geez.
Yeah. I mean, I'd argue they have every sound they possibly need him to make now. And don't need to re-record it for every fresh game.
And Matthew Castle's like, I just want to cut off the line of money going to Charles Martin today. Out of some kind of spite.
For too long. He's bled us dry with his whooping.
We never live as one more than a sentence, right? It's not like he's, you know, talking about... Bowser took Peach again.
I'm so upset and very depressed.
Yeah, I mean, compared to Ratchet and Clank, the guy is still on mute. Yeah, I like his noises, so I guess we just don't see eye to eye on this part, please.
Yeah. So the Samus thing, I mean, there is a game where Samus talks a lot, of course, and that's Other M, which is, you know, she doesn't come off very well in that. She's just very sort of like, you know, sad and stuff.
It's a bit of an odd game tonally. I'm sure this will probably come up in our next episode, won't it, Matthew?
Yeah, it's, I don't know. Yeah, you kind of got a bit... Samus is this kind of silent kind of character, kind of plays into the loneliness of that world quite well.
Like, I think one of the problems, yeah, with Other M is just the fact that you just hear from her so much and, you know, the character in your head probably doesn't sound like that if she did have a voice at all. So her just sort of shrieking on death in, like, Metroid Primes or whatever is... that's fine.
Yeah, I don't really know what approach they're taking in Metroid Dread, because I've not really been watching any of the things. I wanted to be a surprise, and, like, Nintendo seemed to really be going out of their way to show, like, every pixel of that game. So I'm...
yeah, it's quite tough to avoid spoilers at the moment.
Well, it's because it's like the one game they're releasing this Christmas, basically. So, yeah. Yeah.
But they're showing off, like, I think it's going to have some, like, classic bosses in it and stuff. I don't want to see any of that. I want to see that in the game.
Yeah. That's fair enough. I guess I just feel like they've got to sell it hard, because maybe, like, this doing well will, you know, be a big deal or something.
But, yeah. Okay, fair enough. Yeah, I think we've answered that.
But thank you for the kind words about the Zelda episode. I think it's possibly our best one. I really think that was a phenomenal bit of podcasting.
Yeah, it was fun. It was fun. And I hope you do play and enjoy Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess.
I will say there's a certain amount of hand-holding in all Zelda games, because that's just like Nintendo's designed to get you through it. I mean, it's subtle, I would say. It's not just...
it doesn't just say, do this. Bar a couple of examples. So I don't have a huge problem with that element of them.
But again, that's me. And it's all in the Zelda podcast. Let's not go back into that.
Absolutely. Yep. Which you can go download now if you haven't listened to it before.
So imagine Bad eBay Games Court. The retrial is your first episode. There's so much lore built up at this point.
Oh yeah, very confusing.
Yeah, don't worry though, because next week's episode is the best games of 2010, which is a good starting point. How are you feeling about that one, Matthew?
Any fool could enjoy it.
Yeah, how are you feeling about the process of selecting games for that one, Matthew?
Yeah, alright, I must admit, I need to put the work in. I've got to do a bit more planning and prep for that one.
Yeah, same. It's a big year as well. It's like one of the biggest years.
So yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing Matt Castle complain about looking after a farm and Red Dead Redemption again. That's always fun. So yes, thank you very much for listening to this episode.
If you'd like to follow us on Twitter, we're Back Page Pod on Twitter. If you'd like to leave us a review on Apple Podcasts, we'd massively appreciate it. That helps with our visibility and grows our audience.
So anytime someone does that, we really appreciate it.
This is something to chat about on Discord.
Yeah, exactly. Oh, we got another review. That's how sad our lives are.
But we do appreciate it, so thank you very much. But Matthew, where can people find you on Twitter?
I'm MrBazzle underscore Pesto.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts. As I say, next week we'll be back with an episode about the best games of 2010, the latest in our series.
We've done 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 so far. So we're really getting through them now. Thank you very much for listening and we'll be back next week.
