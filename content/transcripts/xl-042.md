Hello, and welcome to the back Backpage XL, a patron exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello Matthew. How's your weekend been? Have you noticed that the British weather decided to skip normal summer? And we had fucking red hot, like, you know, red alert sort of nuclear blast summer. And then We've gone straight back to Rain and you know, these the typical horrors. Is that pretty much like why why can't we just have Moderate summer. What happened to cloudy summer? Fucking love cloudy summer. Any thoughts on the weather, Matthew?

Matthew
00:57
Uh well I've spent most of the weekend indoors. So I haven't really engaged with the weather as much as you, clearly. Are you trapped there? Can you not leave the house or No, I just had a really, really lazy weekend. I had a uh quite a busy week and um Yeah, I've just lounged around in tracksic bottoms playing video games all weekend.

Samuel
01:17
Sounds good and this time not even under under the obligation of recording for the podcast. Just enjoying them in your spare time mostly. Just enjoying them in my spare time, that's right. Well that's nice. I went to Bradford and Avon for a cooked uh cooked dinner. That's not the right term, is it? Cooked dinner. Sunday dinner. That's the they're all all dinners are cooked, aren't they? Most of them are cooked. Or at least prepared. Um yeah, I went to bunch of grapes in Bradford on Avon, which uh is apparently the best roast in Somerset. It is very, very good, very, very high standard. But um that is a town. That absolutely fucking shuts down at 3 pm. There's just nothing to do. Like the the quality of the coffee shops that are open after that time drops dramatically. And then by five o'clock I'm not even sure anything in the town is still going. Um so Yeah, it's one of those places where I think they're like above having a Sainsbury's local. It's that kind of place. Um I don't know how much time you spent there, it's right down the road, but I've just I just never ever go there, but The roast was a good reason.

Matthew
02:10
I think I went there one time when uh just after I got made redundant on RPS. Uh I had a Sunday lunch with my parents. Ma uh maybe that was that. that place. I don't it wasn't it was fine, the roast dinner we had. It's up a little hill.

Samuel
02:25
It's sort of like you know, yeah, on a little hill, sort of most of the way up.

Matthew
02:29
It's Yeah.

Samuel
02:30
I can't Yeah, and it's very like old pub sort of feel to it, you know?

Matthew
02:34
Yeah, I think uh I think I did go there, but all I really remember was, again, the whole redundancy thing. I couldn't tell you what the roast potatoes were like. Oh.

Samuel
02:43
I thought they were excellent actually. That was of a very high standard. Um but I did have a slight uh a social like mishap on the way out. Um I killed the mayor of Bradford on Air. I'm on the run. Oh yes. Waf hopa. This is my final podcast. They'll never catch me. Yeah, so I well I just there was a procession of like oh well I was just I was just leaving the place so minor but it was just a bit awkward because I just I just saw red in it for a very preposterous reason. Right. So went to leave the place after having a lovely lunch. And there was a procession of like six people in their like f I'd say six posh looking people in their forties, saying posh there to just make you like them less. Um but um okay. They all came in one by one out of the rain very slowly, dried themselves off, and like just So so slow, even though we were stood there waiting to get out. And then the last guy came through, dried himself off. And then like Uh thought he hadn't like closed the door properly, went back to close it, and then like went back to close it again and I just saw red and then I just like I just pushed past and went and went we're leaving and then like I just I felt like he was like disregarding Like us standing there. But then he like shot an absolutely foul look at the person I was with. And then and then afterwards um I was told that perhaps I might have been the one who was in the wrong and a little bit impatient. And so That's been like the sort of the the key event of my s my very uneventful Sunday so far.

Matthew
04:05
You've already been put through faux par court this afternoon and f and found wanting by uh by your by by your friends and family.

Samuel
04:15
Yeah. Well this is like um you'll have to ace attorney style go and find the other person down here their side of it and then sort of like and some kind of buffoonish Lotter Hart style, um sort of like a bystander who was there and randomly took a picture of the event to establish the truth. That's now your job, Matthews.

Matthew
04:31
I just don't know if I could be a defence attorney in that situation because I feel like if I felt like the other person was actually right, you know, I don't know if I'd be able to say that given uh you know, our you know

Samuel
04:43
friendship and working relationship Yeah it's true oh you can tell I've not podcasting a week I started with the weather and I'm talking about a very minor s minor social incident that occurred when I was in Bradford Avon Ah so it's alright, it's an Excel, it's Patreon, isn't it? Don't don't put any old shit in here. The same rules don't apply but beyond the paywall. Um Yes, okay, so uh absolute fucking cul-de-sac of a podcast started there, I apologise, but I promise we do have a good episode in store. Um Matthew, I did want to kick off um by asking you about the Nintendo Direct that occurred last week and um I think maybe it's the most annoyed you've been by the Discord in some time um judging by judging by oh sorry, yeah, that is that is confidential like WhatsApp uh.

Matthew
05:27
I'll say I was watching it and having quite a good time going, Oh, that looks quite good or I'm quite into that. And uh yeah, when I went into the Discord, it was just so sour. It was people doing that thing where you do like a sort of slightly snide live commentary of something and it's all very good if everyone's on the same page but if if you don't agree it's a just a bit depressing. So you're like Oh, well I thought it was alright. Just felt like I couldn't be part of the conversation. 'Cause you just gotta let people have their fun, haven't you? Yeah, I thought it was fine. In general. Like lots of lots of games, lots of things we didn't know about. Nothing I'm Hugely sort of pumped for. I didn't think there was anything sort of transformational there. Fire emblems but a pretty pretty juicy one to end on. I have a better idea of what the next six months of Switch two looks like which which is what I wanted.

Samuel
06:16
Indeed, yes. I think it for me it was probably okay, that's how I'd describe it. And But that's alright. There was definitely some key gap uh knowledge gaps being filled in there. Like we didn't know when Metroid was coming out, for example. And we needed that to plot to plot our um Metroid Games ranked episode with Jay Bayless later this year. So we now know that's gonna happen in December, which is use which is useful. And um, you know, Mario Galaxy 2 came back, that was the w people were all all fucking complained about that a few years ago and now they're all like, uh, whatever, where's the new Mario game by the developer who just released a Donkey Kong like f two months ago? And you're like, what world do I live in? Um so those are the things that I bristled out. I I honestly thought the Virtual Boy thing was awesome. I I I know that that got such a weird response from people. Some people are like, oh who cares? Like it was shit. And then other people like me who are like intrigued by the novelty of it. And so I thought I thought it was cool that they brought that back. I thought I was dreaming for a second. That's a a so that's like an announcement no one saw coming, I would say. That's like That's the only thing less likely than that is them doing a Wii U virtual console on the Switch 2, which would which would be even more preposterous. And you can buy like a a separate gamepad to go with your switch to go with it, which is a again a f quite a funny idea. But where did you land on the virtual console thing? Good or bad? Yay or no?

Matthew
07:32
I I have played one when I was on Endgamer, so I I feel like I've scratched that itch for myself, but I've d that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to scratch that virtual boy itch for themselves and s and see what it actually entails. Yeah, I I guess like the thing which I was a little bit like tired of throughout the whole presentation was like the amount of extra tat they were selling. And so the virtual boy kind of got bundled into that in my head of uh they want me to buy a virtual boy and a t and a talking flower that flower that everyone famously hated in Mario Wonder. Uh the idea of having that in my house. It it just I don't know, it's a little bit Alamo, you know, it's it's the side of Nintendo I'm less interested in, but You do need it in order to play the thing, so uh we haven't pre-ordered one. Will we pre-order one? I don't know. It does it does feel like it's like five hours entertainment max W with virtual boy.

Samuel
08:29
The separate peripheral element of it is kind of annoying. Like it's uh there should be some other way you can engage with it, you know, whether it's backwards compatible with LABO or something something like that.

Matthew
08:40
'Cause there's like a cheap cardboard one you can get, right? And it's it's just some kind of lens covering. Why can't they just sell three D glasses with that lens covering? Why do I have to put my head in a weird box?

Samuel
08:52
It looks very similar to the solid eye that came with the Metal Gear Acid 2 on PSP thing, where there's that comical image of a giant cardboard box like on top of a PSP turning it into this like Yeah, what looks like a little kind of fortress from an RTS game or something. Just very preposterous. Um yeah, I definitely won't be buying the plastic word of that. That's um that will just be junk in my house if I buy that. Yeah. I I think I think I agree with you th about the the tat thing generally though. A lot of amiibo in there as well, which I thought they were kind of dead amiibo, but I guess not, you know.

Matthew
09:22
Yeah. I mean that's just you know, you've got the amiibo collectors over a barrel. You know, as long as you keep making them and apparently I think these new ones are a little bit more expensive than the old ones I was reading today. So Good luck filling out those rest of those shells of those pricey amiibos.

Samuel
09:39
Crossy lava strikes again, Matthew. Yeah.

Matthew
09:45
I thought Uh Dragon Quest VII looked really cool. I really liked the art style of that particular sort of remake, that it isn't just another of those sort of 2D HD things which uh i I've kind of a little bit over on now. I thought High War Warriors Age of Imprisonment is looking quite fun. Uh the first one was quite fun, but obviously let down by some tech issues on the Switch, so slightly sort of punt punchier version of that. Looked like there were some bits where you were flying your little zone eye device around in the sky like a little fighter jet segment or something, which I thought were quite cool. A bit of Fatal Frame 2, always always into that. I mean I don't know if it's just uh a redo of what they did on I think they did a Wii U one. So yeah, curious how much of a remake that is.

Samuel
10:33
Why have they why have they remade all those backwards? Didn't they start with the last one that work backwards? That's really really confusing strategy there.

Matthew
10:40
Yeah, I think 'cause well the one that was on Wii, the Fatal Frame Four, obviously looked a bit more modern than some of the others. So I guess it made sense to kind of bring that one back. Also it hadn't been out in the West, but so I I can understand that. But um Yeah, Fatal Frame, uh you know, good spooky time up for that. Um Dangan Ramper 2 with uh it suggested with like a new campaign. I mean short of getting a Dangan Rampa 4 That'll probably be all right. Um unless it's just like a little narrative, you know, uh sort of throwaway thing. But it sounded like it was like trials and new murders and whatnot. Yeah, those were the things. And Fire Emblem, those are the things that I I thought looked quite good. Um I'd say I'm I'm in the middle on Metroid Prime, but being pushed towards Liking it more just by the big baby reaction of the internet to that fucking motorbike. Because This thing of like I've seen ten seconds of something, so I'm just gonna like imagine the rest of the game and then complain about the game I've imagined. I just don't have time for that. Like I think if you can trust anyone to take something and see an idea through and find something interesting in the idea Tends to be Nintendo, like they've got a pretty good track record of not releasing massive pieces of shit. I you know, I can understand. You might not look at that and go, Holy shit, I'm a hundred percent on board, I completely understand this game, but I I did I did get very bored of people throwing their toys out of pram about fucking Samus' bike. I just who gives a fuck, you know? Haha.

Samuel
12:15
Yeah, I I I sort of um I did expect that that would be your reaction to the reaction to be honest. I Um I did I I just knew that would annoy you. Um but yeah, I'm I'm definitely still up for playing that, you know, having played Metro Prime early this year. I think that The the sort of revelation I had playing Original Metroid Prime was that maybe there is there is actually only so much you can really do with the formula of this. It is like a quite a set thing. I don't I would actually find it rad quite hard to radically change what it is 'cause what it is is quite a uh quite a particular thing. It's not like it's an FPS that you just go, what can we do with an FPS? It's a very specific 2D game type translated to 3D and it has to function in a particular way. And so yeah, reinventing it's quite a tall order. So I don't know. I can't get angry at a motorbike, man.

Matthew
13:04
Cause Metro Point three had a bigger scale to it in that you went to lots of different locations and you flew between them in the ship, but I don't think anyone could say getting in the ship and watching a cutscene as you flew between planets was a particularly interactive or rewarding experience. So I can understand the idea of we want to have a bit of scale to this, like maybe we did in Metro Prime 3. but we also want there to maybe maybe a bit more playable connective tissue. Like I I just saw people kicking off about, you know, oh I can't wait to get on that bike and spend a hundred hours in an open world collecting five hundred shiny trinkets. And it's like Why do you think they would ever do that in a Metroid gun? Like that there's just nothing in that trailer to say what that's gonna be. Like the emptiness of that world said this is this is like A to B. This is just to give it a bit of colour in between. I'd be amazed. It's not like fucking Assassin's Creed, you know? It's just bonkers. It's bonkers, what people imagine. Uh and it's like, have you never played any fucking video games in your lives? Oh my god, it was like the night of long mutes on blue sky. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

Samuel
14:14
The Knight of Long Mute's amazing. Oh dear. Well, I mean that's uh a great feedback, honestly. I I enjoyed your take on the direct there. I think um Yeah, I I was sort of I've came out of it thinking, Oh, that's alright. I actually genuinely really looking forward to playing the two Mario Galaxy games. We're gonna do an episode on that probably probably early November. That's T B C but probably early November, so With there's like a r roughly a month for people to play them and for us to play them and think about them a bit. Um we have a few things we want to do in between, like Ghost of Yote is out as well, so we want to cover that either in a what we've been playing or a separate episode. So Mario will come after that, but there's only to Rush a Mario Galaxy episode. We want it to be good. And that film is out next year, so I imagine that'll be a nice evergreen little episode for people to look forward to, Matthew. Um damn it, I forgot to make my joke about Bradford on Avon being like um Bath Shivering Isles, like Bath DLC, and now the moment's really passed. So it's just And underlined it several times in the plan. It was in my it was in my version of the notes in like size twenty-five fonts and I fucked it. Bath shivering aisles. Okay. Um now we move on to the subject of this XL episode. which is all about old Atari games. Um I have subjected Matthew and myself to Atari 50 to dive into the back catalogue of mostly the Atari 2600 or VCS um to Basically, discover a part of gaming or like rediscover a part of gaming as it might be in some cases, that we do not talk about that on the podcast very often. And I thought that the sort of like crash course educational element of it, combined with playing loads of old games back to back, not for very long in most cases, as you'll d as you'll discover very soon. Um would make for a fun episode. Um however I did this um during our week off Matthew and I just want to know did I ruin your week off with this XL episode?

Matthew
16:03
No not at all. I I did some of the playing before the week off. you see, so and then I used uh your guidance uh to steer me towards uh some things that I'd missed. Uh so no I no I I didn't let it become a thing. Um I was yeah, I I was quite sort of disciplined with it. I think you've you've played uh definitely engaged with this more than I have.

Samuel
16:28
Yeah, I I would say so, but I would say uh like not massively more. I mean uh getting through Atari fifty, which is basically a digital museum. that it you know is compiled by um digital eclipse who I think are like the long-term sort of Atari compilation um overseers but have also been doing some other more interesting stuff in recent years Um, you know, it is it was released in 2022, they've expanded it with a bit of DLC. It's like um in its very nature, it's all about giving you the context behind the games. And I think that that is the part of it that ultimately ended up making this quite a fun exercise. And so that's the thing I got into more than the games themselves, I would say, is the idea of contextualizing things. Like that is actually quite a gift to have from what is basically a retro compilation, which are are ten a penny, but you know, it made me think about how most retro compilations do not give you any context, how it is just a pile up of Mega Drive games or a pile up of Sonic Game Gear games and You know, or sorted ephemera that you don't really take that seriously because you know, partly because it doesn't always warrant being taken seriously. A retro compilation by its nature means you're always going to get uh quite a lot of duff stuff in there alongside the few classics that you want to play. But this is like quite an unusual project as we'll get into. So it didn't it didn't ruin my my um week off the episode the week off the podcast, Matthew, for the simple reason that I fit it into three evenings ultimately, which I think is okay for a you know for an episode of this podcast. Um Don Draper voice, that's what the money is for. So that's okay. Um the Patreon um money of course. So You know, I don't really mind that at all.

Matthew
18:04
Um I think Catherine objected to it more than I did because I dragged her into one dose of it. I was like, on the first evening I was like, oh, this'll be fun. Let's take a look at this. She was just so appalled by the state of some of the games that I've had to play it when she's not around.

Samuel
18:21
Yeah, that's yeah. Okay, so I definitely want to get a bit of context for what you you know before you ruined Catherine's evening with that um that whole situation, Matthew. What was your relationship to Atari games before this?

Matthew
18:33
Very very thin. I'd say outside of the extremely obvious Yapongs, breakouts, asteroids, etc. I had no r real knowledge. You know, I they they exist in my head kind of pre n you know pre-nez, I n I have an idea, like a visual idea of what those games look like. But most of the stuff is uh second hand or just opinions inherited from games magazines or picked up over time, years and years of hearing just the ET story recycled, it's things like that. It's like the it's like the top ten hits. The ten things everyone knows about Atari I probably also knew. Um but outside of that, uh yeah, it it gets very thin on the ground and I never had any desire to go back and and look into it. So Yeah, all of this was a bit of an eye-opener for me.

Samuel
19:23
Yeah, I would say it was a similar situation for me. I knew one kid who had an Atari 2600. Or VCS. I don't really know what the fucking accepted terminology is for this, but um I like saying 2600 more, so that is probably what I'm gonna say more here during this episode. Um I think one was was the VCS a rebrand when they released one of the other ones. I think that was maybe what happened. I thought it was the VCS to begin with and became the 2600 later. Well that makes more sense, right? Because it's a series, so yes. Well to be fair, there was a lot of a lot to ingest in those. Um so and and I will just say that that is symbolic really of the the many goofs you're likely to hear during this episode with two people who know nothing about all this. are passing comment on it. So, you know, it's good to get like one mistake out of the way early because you're gonna hear many more, basically. But um I knew a kid, yeah, who had a uh who had a VCS 2600 And he had like Pac-Man and a few other games on it, but he also had a master system and it was around the time I had a Mega Drive. And I remember him being so down on it. He was like Yeah, you know it's a it's a pain in the arse to use. I don't like using it. But I m I I specifically remember the wooden panelling on it and how particular that look of the console is because it it dates it so much. It you know, even like In the mid-90s when, you know, this would have been. I just remember that looking old as shit to me. Like the It just reminded me of like my granddad's stereo, that wooden paneling thing.

Matthew
20:52
Was it your friend's primary console in the mid-90s? I don't think so. Like I think he Okay, because that would be rough.

Samuel
20:58
He had quite a lot, but he didn't he didn't have he didn't have loads of Uh so he's he skipped that 16-bit generation. He had no SNES or Mega Drive, but he got a he got a PlayStation pretty early. Right. And He was like a slightly spoil kid. He had quite he had cut quite a lot of that stuff. But he had loads of these like eight-bit era stuff. I wondered if it was maybe because His dad ate in earlier because his dad was maybe into it at one point or something, because he had a NES, a master system, and an Atari 2600. So I feel like that might be, yeah, he might have had that as like handy downs, but then yeah, as soon as the PS1 launched, he he had that, he had Metal Gear, he had tech and all that stuff. So Yeah, I remember it looking seeming old as shit and not being very excited or even that curious about it to be honest. And then that is basically Ye You know, and like you, I had played some of these games just ambiently. At some point you just play Pong, don't you? It just happens to you Pong. And and same with like with Pac-Man, Breakout. Like, you have encountered some Atari games in the world at some point just from This there's some situation where that's occurred, you know what I mean?

Matthew
22:03
Yeah, I I tell you what one area where I would often see them, uh back in the day when we were trying to find random screenshots of Nez games. You'd often end up looking on like Moby games for inspiration and I don't know if you've if you've looked at Moby Games screenshot gallery recently, but Um it bunches together all the screen or it used to anyway, used to bunch together all the screenshots from every platform of the game. And so within that you'd have the shinier, like the NES version or an Amiga version or whatever. But then you would also have the Atari 2600, which it it often was like an interpretation of the game for that hardware rather than the game itself and you'd always look at those and be like woof I'm so I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm block playing whatever that is. Um uh which is uh definitely something I felt many times preparing for this episode of just like a I cannot believe things were like this

Samuel
23:08
Well that's the funny thing is uh I wonder for our older listeners who are very familiar with these games, what it's like listening to two podcasters who who do anchor um everything in like um sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four-bit and onwards references. Like do you Do you feel like we have a comprehensive enough understanding of games without having this layer of expertise? It's something I thought about while I was playing this. I thought, would that annoy me as a listener to to to perceive that knowledge gap, to know they don't know? the the games slash horrors that I know. And like uh yeah yeah I mean it reminded me of fact the fact that I I think Atari was a huge thing for uh the founder of Imagine Publishing, um, one of them because um they had an Atari Star Wars um arcade machine. in the office and it never worked. It was like right by the water machine, which seemed like a bad idea. And that's like a final destination scene waiting to happen. And at some point it got Yeah, it just it just it never worked the whole time I was there, but it was always there when it was that was there. And so I didn't understand it, but I remember th seeing images of what the actual game looked like and being a bit bummed out I never got to try it 'cause I thought It's got those nice um vector graphics I'd like to see see that kind of in motion. Um but yeah, never happened. And I also uh at some point I have seen that fucking um computer space machine. It might just be because it's a very famous design, but it's like a you know kind of like a yellow 2001 a space odyssey looking thing. um with like these soft edges, so it looks very sci-fi. I've I've seen that at some point. I feel like either in person or I must have seen it like extensively talked about. in a video or a TV show or something. But this is bits of iconography from across these years which do do kind of make sense to me. But um Yeah, my lot knowledge this period definitely very very top line. And so I think uh my understanding, Matthew, is that Atari brought games into the living room. That was a a big part of what he did. They, you know, and They before this made arcade cabinets, uh you know, they kind of like teed them up to um to sort of take over the the living room. They were there with their the 2600 and over time They flooded the market with low quality products. And then the crash happened, um, which was partly caused by Atari, but where the blame gets placed on, you know, a as part of that. It was a bit a subject of discussion by some of the game designers in this Atari 50 compilation actually. And then by the time you get to the late 80s after the crash, Nintendo and Sega arrive. with much better games. That may annoy our listeners to hear. I don't know, but my understanding is that they they just made s slightly sharper games and slightly Um and deeper games as well. And that when you play through Atari 50, I would say it's very obvious they have nothing as good as the Legend of Zelda on Nez or Super or Mario Bros. Like I would say that's That is and so it would appear that superior design combined with the fact that Atari was very shit at like Basically figuring out what the next generation of their games console would look like and become dependent on the 2600. So it's its lifespan stretches out way past when it's Really still cutting edge technology. And then you have Nintendo and Sega right there ready to just steal steal their business. Is that The rough shape of it, do you think?

Matthew
26:38
That sounds like it. It's it's weird playing the game because the way it's structured. all their arcade history, which, you know, is arguably, you know, very s sort of successful and where a lot of their kind of like critically acclaimed game ideas are shown. That's all like bundled right at the start. That's like the first strand of this collection. And then after that you're just into sort of console struggles for 20 years. And as a result of that, you kind of can forget that the that the arcade sort of relative success story's still kinda going on. So that's that's the that's the only bit I'd add, is like they're still doing arcade stuff in the background and y they seem to be generally doing okay with it, was was my read on it. Yeah, you're right actually. That's like the they they are happening concurrently those two things. Yeah, that's that's the thing you have to keep reminding yourself. And it helps that a lot of the games on the consoles are ports of much more successful games. in the arcades and then so you're you're constantly kinda going, Oh right, this is happening at the same time that's happening, I get that. Um but yeah I I th I thought the major takeaway was yeah company struggling to uh like what to do next or like how how to to weather the the generational shift between consoles theirs being the first one and never really understanding it. Yeah. I mean they made like seven was it like seven successors almost, I think To the 2600? Um all numbered like sometimes higher, sometimes lower, always more powerful. God knows what was going on with the numbering.

Samuel
28:20
Yeah, it's um i it's interesting because there's a little bit of uh I would say like an apology tour going on with some of the discussion in this because they talk about the idea that The 2600 was a you know huge success. It sold, I think, thirty million um, you know, units all in, which is, you know, massive and uh you know at the time that it they were huge they were owned by um by Warner and during that time they you know it it basically made bank for Warner. um before things started to go wrong. And they say that because there was no established pattern for how do you succeed the you know, like a console in the market in this way, that's what that's what led to their struggles with the 5200, the 7800, um the the XEGS, the Lynx, and the Jaguar ultimately. Um so, you know, it's I I would say though that I don't I think they just fucked it personally, um, hearing the story. Like I thought, well, uh the idea of like a successor product to uh you know, especially in technology, the idea of a product that succeeds another because it's superior technologically. Surely there was like another paradigm for that elsewhere. Surely even in like in the the world of like arcade games, the technology moved on so quickly you would understand why you know, sort of like pushing things forward would be important to people. Um I would say th the combination of them being I think they got they're they're a little bit trapped by the fact that they were i originally an arcade developer and a lot of their games were made for arcades and I think that a lot of their problems stem from the fact that they don't make Many huge games that break that original paradigm and in fact they are so dependent on the same view Asteroids, uh, you know, like um Sentibane breakout. Sent Sentibe Breakout. They come up over and over again. Missile Command. And, you know, they make new versions of those games and you don't see the design moving forward in this super meaningful way, um, even as the technology is getting better. And so I think they're kind of like They'll they were almost sort of uh too successful out of the gate and then I think they were just obsessed with trying to like replicate that and hope that it would the same few things would still work while also making slightly dodgy hardware decisions. And The other thing that happens is that it this is also covered by Atari fifty, is that they become a pretty successful uh you know home computer um company as well. Like they sell affordable computers at the time that I believe that the Apple II was like the the big, you know, sort of tasty piece of home computer technology. And for a little while there they are they're doing alright. So Yeah, super interesting company, but you see it slipping out of their grasp as time goes on. And by the late eighties it just seems quite apparent that they're never really gonna uh you know, as you were following this chronologically in Atari 50, they're never gonna get this back. Like in you un you start to understand why I would say. Um so Matthew, like I say, for we did use Atari 50 for this episode. A lot of our knowledge that we're gonna, you know, we're basing this on is is from that. Um A third DLC focused on Namco games is coming soon before that compilation. You know, three years later they're still adding to it, which I think is really cool. Um but I I was wondering what you you made of Atari 50 as an overall project. I think we should talk about some of the um interview content and anecdotes there, 'cause I I personally thought that the Atari fifty element of it was probably superior to playing the games themselves for me in 2025. Is that how you felt too? 100%.

Matthew
31:46
But it did carry me through because seeing the enthusiasm and love that the people in the the documentaries had for it. But it it definitely helped contextualize it. I definitely think As as a package for me, um the the best stuff was when they actually had super fans like around the games talking about them. Um so very much that there's quite a bit of Tim Schaefer in here, um, who is obviously just a huge Atari head. and passionate about the whole project from start to finish. Like, you know, he's still a e evangel uh ev evangelizing you know, the homebrew scene years on, you know, was even into like um the links and you know uh talks about his frustration at you know, all his friends being into like Game Boy and he was into this, but I I felt like whenever he he he kind of popped up, uh, I kind of understood the appeal of it a bit more than I did with you know, some sort of older developers and, you know developer legends saying like how they did it. Um but but I guess you need both sides of those and that's that's why it works quite well as a collection. But I I I I think a version of this which is just like the history lessons and people talking about how they made hardware that I I hadn't ever played before. um is slightly less appealing than people kind of putting it in context of like why this was good at the time, like why adventure was exciting or why Yar's Revenge was exciting. you know, what what it was to actually be a player of these games. Um I thought whenever it kind of like sort of humanized it a bit more, I thought this was like really cooking.

Samuel
33:35
Yeah, I I like that too. Like it has a little bit of cliffy bee in there. Yeah. And I I I was like trying to sort of it's quite hard to sort of date Cliffy Beans. He's sort of he's he's he's looked the same for about twenty years. Um we cut him open and count the rings. Um yeah I enjoy the I enjoy the Tim Schaefer bits of this too and I actually think they could have had a few more Super fans discussing a little bit of context there. But I will say that this comp this compilation's I think achievement beyond the the anecdotes and the context is that I it got me into the headspace enough of if I was a kid and like I got you know th this cartridge home and I played this game for the first time. at home in my house, how would it feel? And like occasionally the occasional moments where I could just see like the magic of it or I could just imagine myself spending a summer playing that game. Like it The timeline nature of it does allow you to get in that headspace, I would say. So that's another way in which I think it's successful because you are so you are placed so firmly in the context of the time by this by this museum format I'd say that's that's true.

Matthew
34:42
Th the the bit of it which did make me laugh is because every game comes with like an interactive box and instruction manual and all all all that stuff, which you definitely have to read to like pass most of these games. I never stopped finding it funny, the gulf between the quality of the box art and what the games look like on the 2600. because they sell you on an incredible fantasy. Like who e like I I I think they talked to a couple of the illustrators in some of the documentaries, but There was someone who had like almost a bit of uh oh who did the Indiana Jones posters? Oh, uh Drew Streuser. Yeah, almost had an element of that like very like photorealistic pictures of like knights and all this exciting stuff happen and you were like wow this this really like evokes an exciting world and then you play the game and it would inevitably be two rectangles. bouncing a block against each other in some variation. And you'd be like, whoa, which of these blocks is that amazing for a realistic night? Um and yeah, like I can imagine a kid looking at those art And and then looking at the games and being like, What is going on?

Samuel
35:56
Yeah, it's um it's funny because the uh sometimes I I was like um impressed by the extra materials that the Atari made at the time to go with it. So um some of the more interesting games from the Bunch here, and I'm not saying uh I'm you no I did not use the word good. were the sword quest games, which were three games in a Nintendo four game series that um they got the comic. Um they have a they have a comic with them which helps helps you to figure out what the elements of the game are and the comics of a very high quality. It's done by, I believe, Roy Thomas and uh God, I've forgotten his name. He's like the one of the most famous Spider-Man writers ever. Jerry Fuck, I forgot his name. I think he's the writer who killed Gwen Stacy.

Matthew
36:41
Um anyway, he's a he's a comics.

Samuel
36:44
I've can't believe I've forgotten his name. I'm not actually great on um Silver Age Marvel. I will find I'll find his name before the end of the episode. But It was of such a high quality. And then I looked at the comic that came with Yahs Revenge, which they made a big deal about, and it's one of the worst things I've ever seen. Like it was it was just so It's like a year seven art project or something by like uh sort of someone who's in like second um level sort of art class like it i it was su it was just so unimpressive and I was like How is it the same company that put both these things out? And it it's what you realize is that at the time they were figuring a lot of this stuff out as they went, and so something's just had the investment and they tried something and something's just were might be a bit shit, but it c it came out anyway. It happened anyway. And that's kind of interesting education of this. Um something else I noted from the materials, Matthew, is I thought there was massive magazine energy. to the fact that for a long time, that most of it seems like most of the first half of the VCS lifespan, they went with 23 games in one style, um, kind of like uh messaging on the boxes where

Matthew
37:53
Yeah.

Samuel
37:54
All it really meant was like a mode or a minor change or a different level. And like, but that had big like magazine, eight free gifts energy to it.

Matthew
38:03
Um, yeah. I made that connection, but now you say it, I absolutely see it. Yeah. Oh there's so many twenty-one and it's like twenty-one m modes of of the same quite bad Cowboy shootout game.

Samuel
38:19
Yeah. So I I really valued the effort to to bring that stuff in. In fact, there were times where I thought they could actually have had a bit more documentary stuff than they did. Um Like the cra the the details on the crash, you know, it's a you know, yes, it's an era we all know what it is in its rough shape, but it was so fundamental it changed the livelihoods of uh all the people work in this industry and you only really get about like I think three or four minutes on it. It's not it's not super long. I think maybe there's a bit of assumed knowledge there. Well they you know you know about the ET thing. Here's a picture of the fucking landfill site where the ETs were buried. Yes, very good. And so they kind of like yada yada it a bit, which I kind of get. But um loads of other stuff I really liked. Um I would say I I I put this on blue sky, but um Missile Command, the the port of that for the VCS, which is one of the most impressive ports that I you know that I think is in this collection. You're like, wow, that would have been really impressive to have at home. Like how they've captured the essence of this game. Um sold over 2. 5 million copies. Um the um uh Rob uh Rob Fullop who worked on on this, I'm probably saying his name incorrectly there. Um expected a substantial bonus check that year, but was instead given a coupon for a free turkey. Um this led him to quit Atari and co-founder publisher Imaj. And there is literally a picture of the free turkey token. Included in the Atari 50 compilation and I love that shit.

Matthew
39:39
That's that's got big future giving us all a £10 Marks and Spencer's food voucher as our Christmas bonus.

Samuel
39:46
Yeah.

Matthew
39:47
Giving someone food for Christmas as their Christmas bonus is quite Dekenzian as a concept.

Samuel
39:54
Wasn't that 2014 or something?

Matthew
39:56
Like a year that they were really like not doing very well.

Samuel
39:59
I mean they should have just given us some free shares. They weren't worth anything at that point and we bought and made some money later on, but oh well. Um yeah, so that was really interesting. Um I did like understanding as well just how badly paid these designers were. Like they're on like $20,000. And I would say treated pretty horribly by Warner at the time. Um this guy, is it Ray Cassar? Just sounded like I think he's dead, so you can't libel him. Absolute piece of shit. Like all-time piece of shit. Was that the vibe you got about him as well, Ray Cassar?

Matthew
40:30
They they s certain people because obviously they're either dead or not involved in the documentaries, they only exist as as headshots that you see a lot. There was quite a kindly man who kept appearing that everyone seemed to like. Um and it just made me laugh that he only ever he appeared as like twenty different headshots. It was always the same sort of mustached incredibly seventies photo. Um I did like all that stuff. I think the some of the promotional materials to call them adverts seems wrong because I struggled to see where these adverts would be placed, because they had some of them like five hundred maybe five hundred plus words of content on them because they just had such dense paragraphs explaining like what the game was or extra things. It was just interesting to see people not really know like how to sell these things. You know, that they're almost adverts that look like magazine pages and there were some magazine pages in the mix too and it was interesting seeing like developers being quite present in the fan magazines uh for these games and so it's not just a company working out how games consoles and games are gonna work in the home. It's like everyone working out how are we gonna talk about these things and show them and depict them and what is the first games media that comes out of this, you know.

Samuel
41:50
Yeah, like um they talk a bit about Atari Age magazine in there, right?

Matthew
41:54
Which is Yeah, that's it.

Samuel
41:55
Yeah, so that's like a key a key part of it. But yeah, I agree, not all of it was super clear where it would be. Um This probably requires knowledge of the the US games media landscape in the eighties, which we we definitely lack. Um so I don't really know what was around then. Um so I couldn't I couldn't really comment, but um I would say definitely very very off the time um sort of advertising in terms of like and I mean that across the entire compilation right up until the nineties where they're literally including images of um Sonic and Mario being eaten by a Jaguar, um which could not be a less accurate um depiction of what was going on in the console market at that time. Um absolute stinkaroonie of a console. Um yeah, so so really good I did I did enjoy that. Um I also I I must call out the clip very early on. where there was disagreement about whether drugs were being done um at Atari, which is something that I think Kotaku covered in a piece a few years ago that like it was When the the money was flowing, there was a bit of a debauched um atmosphere there. There was some discussion of like brown envelopes full of um full of weed in this. Um And then um I think one of the co-creators of Pitfall um very sternly going, I didn't do any drugs and I didn't approve kind of thing and then um cutting to another guy going like yeah there was one guy didn't like us doing drugs, so he moved his office to a different building. And I loved I love that they were candid enough to talk about that. I would say Atari 50 won me over instantly with that kind of um that kind of frankness, you know, which You can only really get when you've like lost, you know? Like you when you when you're the losers telling the story in retrospect, you can be honest about that stuff. You'll never much in the way that we know quite a lot about what went wrong with Sega, you know, but we we know nothing really about how Nintendo operated during the same time period. But You get a transparency here that I would say is is fun. I think that had a bit of magazine energy. Did you get that as well?

Matthew
43:43
Yeah, d yeah, I'd say I'd say there was a bit of that. Um yeah, d definitely I I I maybe got more of the magazine energy from the from the kind of the super fans, sort of editorializing it a little bit. Um 'Cause there are there are there were moments where I tell you one thing I I I I I did not criticism as such, but something I uh that could have helped. Is it it it it never really gave you Uh it told you like, oh this game was sold two million copies and was really successful, or this game was one of the more popular ones. You didn't really get a sense of how maybe 90% of these games actually performed. uh, like whether they were critically acclaimed, whether they sold loads, were they considered bad, which I mean th they probably weren't going to say like, oh by the way, this game was scored like thirty percent in the magazines at the time. But I w I would almost like to have had that. Like I felt there were there were some games I y you know, I was playing and thinking, Well, this is so rancid. Uh like I don't really know why it's here and w like was this considered rancid at the time? Like I would have just quite liked to have known. Like some of them I looked up after the facts just to see what the consensus was and people like, oh yeah, this is terrible. Um and y you know, it's I don't really know who they were protecting by not like including that information or being a bit more open about it, 'cause it's all the past, you know? I don't think anyone would be too upset if you were like, ah, we all knew this thing was a bust.

Samuel
45:13
Yeah. I I actually I f I found I s I was starting to be able to read between the lines on this on this because I noticed that if something was acclaimed and did well they would go out of their way to tell you that, oh yeah, Yahs Revenge was like really good and also they'd include more materials for that one game. And then they w well they would deliberately deliberately point out praise when it's a game that was significant. And then they would say they would just go pure cold objective fact when the game was a piece of shit. And so that was like as much as much as they really throw you a bone on that. But I do agree with you. It might be nice to be like, you know EGM said this was dog shit. Like that might actually have been like quite good context or something.

Matthew
45:59
But um I played all these twenty six hundred games and I didn't know like Aside from like the obvious big hitters which everyone's heard of, like, are are are these meant to be good? Like what what what am I meant to be thinking about this? Or or what were they thinking about this at the time? Maybe it would have helped a little bit, but it's a minor point.

Samuel
46:22
Yes. So I suppose like This is the big question, Matthew. What did you make of the games overall in Atari 50? I would say I mostly had a bad time playing them.

Matthew
46:30
Um Uh at one point I turned to Catherine and said, I'm actually surprised video games took off as a medium, given that this is what they were. Um there's some quite rough stuff here. And I I don't mean this in like too shitty a way, but it it it def it gave me like an a newfound respect even more than I already had for like Sega and Nintendo for like where their games were at at the same time.

Samuel
46:56
Yeah.

Matthew
46:57
Because everyone goes, oh, it's iconic, it was legendary, it arrived and it was revolutionary and transformational. But because I didn't actually have that sort of foundational knowledge in what people were playing before that, you just take it for granted a little bit and then you're like, oh yeah, the step up here is enormous. And Uh you know, that may just sound like needlessly dunky on it. Don't worry, there are some things here I liked that we'll get to, but my general vibe was You know, I just I I don't know, I'm just too steeped in modern gaming to like even imagine a time where this was good. One of the first games I remember playing myself was like a Chippendale game on the NES and being like, Wow, I've never seen anything that you know, looks as good as this or is as good as this that you that a game you can play that's amazing. Like you know, you're like trying to imagine your like six or seven year old self reacting to like fucking warlords on the twenty six hundred and I just don't think he would have gone for it. Um but it's it's I don't know. I I I maybe I just struggled to put myself in that headspace. So I'm I'm kinda curious Uh how you go on, because you seem to be having a better time.

Samuel
48:14
I actually um yeah, I mean I I would say that I'm slightly guilty of maybe feeling like as we approached a a a more familiar time in video games, I got more excited to see what Atari were making. Oh definitely. Because Because I know in nineteen ninety one Sonic the Hedgehog came out and I know what that game looked and sounded like. And it was and you realise, like you say, y putting it alongside what Atari was putting out in the early nineties is It was light years away. It must have been absolutely astonishing to play Sonic the Hedgehog and after playing these games. Like it incredible. And I actually just felt a little bit like. It's just such a sort of good c it's such a good cautionary tale in in this about like it seemed like such a mistake that they sold to Warner. Like that was so like it just fucked the company basically from there and it was a race to the bottom from there. And so you have this what feels like this early explosion of creativity and then just sort of like It just sort of never really progresses in a meaningful way. And then the most interesting thing happen that happens with the 2600 is that It becomes this sort of hobbyist platform and has such a remarkably long life that you get quite far into its lifespan and people are still making interesting games for it. That part of the 2600 was was interesting, but I will admit to feeling like a bit of existential despair every time a new fucking missile command like port came up or like, oh yeah, we we put it on this this for this Atari console didn't do very well. It's like another what the fu they they did a fucking uh I can't believe I'm playing Millipede again, the inferior the inferior centipede sequel. Like how is this happening?

Matthew
49:57
The sexy centipede

Samuel
49:59
Yeah and then it would be like I it s it was so har there were some things where it was so hard to relate to what it would have been like in the moment that it felt incredibly abstract to me. So the idea of like s so s uh sword quest which I mentioned was like a Fan sort of fantasy series where there was almost it was almost like a viral game or something where there was like there were like real life elements to help you solve it. And it was It basically a form of like adventure game where you walked between all these different identical rooms until you came across a mini-game, did that, and there was some larger meta puzzle to unpick involving the aforementioned um comic books that came came with the with the games. And they did three of them. Um they never did a fourth, but they included a fourth um digital eclipse on this compilation I there's a little tribute to it, which is A nice idea, but I will admit to thinking that those games were completely rancid. And so I really had to like it really took a leap of faith to be like Yeah, I I believe you, game design man, when you tell me that this was this really mattered in the moment. And so I had that experience a few times where I just I just felt too far away from what it was to understand it. But then You also have this thing that hits you of, well, there's a reason that the Atari sort of like successors were successors, that they were They are the building blocks of game design, yes, and not much more than that in a lot of cases, but they're really strong building blocks. This is why they got a foothold. This is what people wanted. Pong asteroids in the house and you understand why, because they you know, there's a a beautiful simplicity to them. It's you know, and there's a few of th those games that really um tick that box. But There was there's a lot of shit in here. Like it's it's it's maximalist in a way, but like you will just you will despair a lot of these if you are millennials, I would say, like us. So Yeah, it was a really interesting deep dive, but oh my my god, I never ever want to see another version of fucking I mean Warlords, I was like I can't believe I'm playing Warlords again. There's a bit of that to it. Breakout definitely. I think Breakout is boring as shit. I do not want to play Breakout ever again. Um Yeah, so uh definitely had that Matthew. Uh so what are the highlights of what you played, Matthew? Maybe a a top five if you have one?

Matthew
52:13
By far and away, like the best, most playable, legitimately great game that's in this collection is Tempest 2000.

Samuel
52:21
Yeah, I I completely agree with you on that, yeah

Matthew
52:24
Um which is Jeff Minter's Jaguar game remixed or reimagined as Space Giraffe. Uh I talked about Space Giraffe on a podcast a few months ago and clumsily went, oh I think this is based on Tipus 2000. when now I'm like, oh well obviously, you know, just the same same guy. But in terms of like taking the arcade attitude of the company and the arcade roots and giving it a bit of like 90s energy with these like mad visuals and this like techno soundtrack and w weird sound bites that they've sampled, all very what we now know to be sort of Jeff Minter's thing. Yeah, seeing it here, it's It's you know, it's like a game from space compared to the other ones. You know, it's like completely out there and it's got a real clear vision to it and attitude to it and it's still very you know ver very f fun and and and sort of fizzy to play. Yeah, I'd never really like put one on one together that's that that this was a Jaguar thing.

Samuel
53:27
Yeah, I was um surprised by that and uh th this is a great example of They don't pass comment on the other Jaguar games you've played up onto that point. Spoiler alert, they're all dog shit. Um but like with this one, they're like it's it was basically a surprise killer app is how they put it. Yeah. And Yeah, it's absolutely it's like a ready-to-go XBLA game, basically, Tempest 2000. Like it it moves so quickly, it looks beautiful, it sounds great, it's oh it's so good. It's so good, it's like Wow, I've really been playing some terrible games on this and this just reminded me of how terrible some of these has been, you know?

Matthew
54:03
And it's interesting because something that they do in Atari 50 is that they've remade some of the classic arcade games in like a m modern in-house style. Like they they've they've sort of paid homage to them and a lot of them it just means they've taken the game and and added like quite a sort of shouty, like neon electric style to them, so they all look a bit like geometry wars. And I wouldn't say many of those like particularly had the juice. Like the rules they were playing with felt, you know, too too like minimalist or old fashioned or i and I I found that like jarring with th this very modern skin they'd put on it, where actually, you know, Tempest two thousand does feel like, you know, s someone has taken something old but has something completely new to say with it and um kind of put those

Samuel
54:57
those other, you know, remakes into sort of start relief. Yeah. The sort of like jump ability in that and the power-ups just turn it and it just turns it to such a different fun kind of experience. And honestly, I've played none of Jeff Minter's games before. So all this is pretty all this is pretty new to me, but obviously I've played loads of things that have been inspired by this in terms of the st aesthetic and um soundtrack, etc. Um that's a good call, Matthew. Like uh yeah that's that is my number one on my list as well. So glad we agree on that. What else do you have?

Matthew
55:28
The the jump from that one down to the next is is so extreme. And you're probably gonna think this is shit, but I I actually didn't mind ninja golf. Oh, I I thought it was like a a novel charm to ninja golf. Yeah, it that felt to me like a bit like a modern indie game where someone's taken golf at plus ninjas. Just f it felt a bit sort of m modern and silly compared to some of the other games. Um the the actual golf mechanic, very very basic. It's just like a direction of a power meter, but it's it's there's uh no like golfing physics or simulation going on here. But between each hit you then run to your ball in a like a 2D side-scrolling uh kind of action gauntlet as a ninja fighting other ninjas on the golf course. It's not a good golf game, it's not a good ninja game, but I mean it was something. Like it I like like there was there was enough here that I could react to it for five minutes. Which isn't true of like a lot of games. I like that.

Samuel
56:28
I think a lot of people at the time said that Ninja Golf was well when you see people talk about it now, they're like, Oh yeah, it was it was novel. It's not outstanding at either the ninja part or the golf part but as a combination it's kind of a fun game.

Matthew
56:39
Yeah I thought that was that was okay. Again I I don't really like any of these. I picked Ruiner Pinball just because it's a pinball game that I could actually play. I don't think it's a particularly good pinball game, but it seemed to be Cold War themed and it I did like That the flippers were giant missiles.

Samuel
56:57
I didn't really understand how to like make the right flipper move in this. Like it was I wonder if the controls were fucked or something, because I can make the left flipper move but not the right flipper move, so I just sort of Quietly noped out of that one.

Matthew
57:09
Oh yeah, well I yeah, again, like I managed to make them work for like all of ten to fifteen minutes. Um like quite an eye strain. I mean really this gets a pass because I you know, I just like Even a bad pinball game, you know, it's still kind of pinball and you can play it for a little bit and go, oh yeah. And yeah, it had quite an obnoxious art style, which was which was something. Uh of of the oldies, uh the one which I thought was the best, and despite being all uh wheeled out eight million times, was Missile Command. Yeah, I you know, you're firing missiles up at missiles coming down, uh trying to sort of get in the path of incoming missiles. Slightly different that. They're kind of predicting the movement of something and reacting to it. Uh I'm not gonna say I I I was in love with it or I'm like gonna get a fucking missile command tattoo now. But uh O of of like that that generation of like, you know, Pong asteroids break out. A lot of them I thought I've played. much better versions of this elsewhere. Uh this is st you know, it's still reasonably singular.

Samuel
58:16
I agree with you. I I think the specific Cold War inspiration of it as well, like the That makes sense. I also thought that the uh Atari Lynx version of Missile Command was probably the best one. Like it looked very handsome, um, but was still about about as simple to play as the 2600 mate. I like a don't I don't think I maybe actually you do control the multiple missile um posts but I found it's slightly simpler to play than the arcade one but Just has really beautiful sort of like pixel art explosions. You can imagine it as a GBA game. It's you know it's which is the nicest thing you can say about an Atari Lynx game, really. But I agree with you, like it's this missile command I would say that I felt like I was locked in first gear playing through Pong, Breakout, etc. And then you get to Missile Command and you're like, oh no, this is immediately way better than those things, you know? Yeah.

Matthew
59:07
And the last one, which, you know, uh you you put me on too, or or y y made me take a second look. I quite like Yar's Revenge.

Samuel
59:15
Yeah. Yeah.

Matthew
59:16
I uh I agree. It's cool. Which was uh as the guy the guy said in the little mini documentary, the first video game with backstory, he boasted about having stayed up all night writing like the fictional history of um What to me appears to be a fly that occasionally shoots a laser at an eye. But um w whatever. And like you said, gave us one of the worst comic books of all time. Um but yeah, I mean it's kinda weird, but p i pla playable enough Oh god. Yeah. That's the best you can say for some of these.

Samuel
59:55
I I sort of understand where you're coming from. I think I largely feel the same, but like I I think that um so my top five is centipede I put in here. Um I think original arcade centipede, I was like, oh no, this this is good, this is fun, this has got a simple idea to it and it works pretty well. I'm not gonna tell you like it's a you know, you should play this over fucking like any other sort of like, you know, vertical shooter. If you have Ikaruga on your on your Xbox like I do, no need to play centipede really. Um, but I would say it's just something that like w the fur one of the first games that really clicked with me, um, Centipede um is it. And I will say that the the the console port of Millipede was alright, actually the one they included in this. It included it throws in a few more complex elements. um to mix it up. But it never changes drastically. It the Centropy just gets faster, the map gets more cramped. It's just quite a good for a solid formula, I think. I've put Yar's Revenge at four. I agree. It's just really There's something about the the homing missile and the fact that you have to be you have to posit basically the game is um you have to blow up the shield of this alien ship um while it periodically fires at you and a very slow moving, increasingly fast moving as the levels go on. um missile floats towards you and um in between is this kind of like weird 2001 a space odyssey style field kinda kind of strange mistron quality to it like The neutral zone where you you cannot shoot um the enemy in there. And so there's a lot of like it's all of a game all about positioning basically and and kind of like move keeping yourself moving at all times. And And then once you've broken the shield you get to the kind of enemy core, is it an I something like that, Matthew? Um you basically um have to like make a homing missile fly towards it, but get out of the path of the homing missile before it blows you up. It's got enough moving parts to it where you're like, this is genuinely decent. And I I could say I would definitely have got into this as a kid, like, for sure. If I had only this and it was the eighties and there was like no you know sort of like n very l few good TV shows on. Um I could see why this would be This would be very appealing if you got like a lot of spare time on your hands and not as many things vying for your attention as you do now, um, you know, by a factor of about a hundred. Um so I really like that about it. And um despite the terrible comic book as established, um yeah it's just something it's just that little twist on top with the homie missile thing that just makes it I I think it just a bit uh more than just a simple throwaway game, you know?

Matthew
01:02:24
Yeah, the thing I didn't understand here, and this is maybe my fault for not engaging with the law, is You reload your cannon. The the cannon is the only thing that can kill the eye, but you have to touch the eye to reload it. You have to like fly up to it and then fly back. I didn't really understand what that was trying to convey.

Samuel
01:02:43
Oh right. I thought it was that you can only make it home by being next to the eye. as it shoots, like as opposed to it reloading, it was like you have to be on the enemy in order to fire it.

Matthew
01:02:55
No, you touch you know it's touching the eye makes it a

Samuel
01:02:58
Oh right. So you do you don't have to actually be near the eye?

Matthew
01:03:03
Then get the fuck out of there 'cause I didn't want to be near a big eye or f dis Obviously.

Samuel
01:03:06
Two uh two giant men misunderstand Yah's revenge. Um that's the that's the episode.

Matthew
01:03:11
Listen, if anyone knows Yah's inside and out and can explain what exactly is going on with that, but I thought it was like you go in, touch the eye, get out of there. then fire the missile from a distance, which was quite hard. But your technique does sound better for hitting it, yeah.

Samuel
01:03:26
Yeah. The other thing I was a bit perplexed by with Yars Revenge is why there's only two layouts for the shield, seemingly. Like I got through Four levels, I think. And I believe it's just like there's a square, there's like a rectangle one and a one that's slightly boomerang shaped, and that's it. And I'm like, why aren't there like Like 90 different shapes. Surely that would be fairly simple. I'm talking here knowing fucking nothing about the memory limitations of the VCS. They're definitely not hidden away in like one of 17 modes. That was one of the one the one of the games that didn't have that on the box actually. So yeah, so I I think Lars Revenge Lars Revenge. Who the fuck is Lars? Lars von Trier's Revenge. Lars Revenge um was perfectly um perfectly fine. And then yes, Missile Command on Lynx, like I say, but any of the missile command the the VCS ones was pretty impressive. Like I say, that would have taken over a summer for your boy and if I had it back if I was alive back then. You can't cosplayer is it though, can you? Not really, no. Um Solaris is my number two, which is a pretty late in the day game. I think it came out ten years after the VCS launched in the I think it was the late 80s. And this is a game that quite graphically advanced considering the the hardware. But basically like a a bit I think it's a bit of a for uh is it a forerunner to Elite or maybe maybe it's not actually it might be after uh I can't remember um where it falls in that timeline. But It's basically an arcade shooter with rudimentary 3D. You blow up spaceships and move across this galactic map, like hyperspacing your way to different areas to refuel to like save civilians and they're gonna keep moving. And I thought that of all the different space shooters of this, and I'm afraid I found most of them rubbish, including Star Raiders. I thought this was the the most playable of them. And the fact that it had like the kind of adventure exploration map element to it on top of that meant I thought it was just Just pretty cool, like pretty amazing for you know the limitations to the hardware, which I've I'd seen what else it could do, and what else it could do is not very impressive generally speaking. But This was cool. Did you play Solaris Mackie?

Matthew
01:05:24
Yeah, I did. I I str I struggled with all the in cockpit pseudo 3D shooters. throughout Atari history. Yeah. But then I'm I've I've always struggled like old school elite as well. Like I just I I I find that visual style very hard to get my bearings in. Um And so I just go, yeah, not for me. There was a guy in one of the documentaries was who was like, I still uh get out the old Atari 800 and play Star Raiders now, and it was like, what? You're insane. You're insane for doing that. Why aren't you playing like fucking X-Wig Alliance?

Samuel
01:06:05
It would have been taken to CX long ago, Star Raiders. Um yeah, I think that the um Star I I found that most of these Atari space games had like collision detection issues where I couldn't work out where the enemy ships are blowing up in relation to my ship, but it felt like they're in the middle distance and then suddenly my ship had blown up because we'd collided. And I was like, oh That seems that seems uh annoying. But I thought that um Solaris was slightly better for this and slightly f it felt quite fast moving for what it was, and I like the the hyperspace jump thing was quite impressive for again for what the twenty six hundred could do. I'm not saying it's better than Star Fox sixty-four, it's not, but it's like, yeah, I I I I I probably slightly preferred it to Ya's Revenge in the end, because I did quite a lot of it. Um Tempest 2000, my number one, Matthew, as a agreed. I mean Yeah, an absolute bolt from the blue. Holy fuck. I cannot believe Atari reversed into making something this good so late into its lifespan where it make made so much, so much crap. So um yes, good. Um Now for the stinkaroonies, Matthew.

Matthew
01:07:14
Uh I I really struggle with Sword Quest, and we gave that a proper go. Uh it's so cryptic, this this maze you're in, and then you're picking up random objects, and if you had a certain object in a certain room, that room might behave differently. but I couldn't really interpret what any of the objects were. I didn't want to keep consulting the instruction manual. There was a there was a one room which I'd describe as like the worst version of Frogger that that's ever been made and watching Catherine trying to do that that's that's when she noped out of like Atari 50 being a communal experience. Um Yeah, uh just yeah, really, really cursed. The what was going on in the Jaguar era was well was wild. Um th some of those games. Trevor McFerr.

Samuel
01:08:04
Oh yeah, that was rough. I mean So it's basically a side scrolling shooter, but with like loads of anthropomorphic creatures, but looks oddly ugly. Looks a bit like um a bit of the old Donkey Kong uh country visual style.

Matthew
01:08:23
Yeah, sort of digitised sprites, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that was really rough. Um Atari cart. Uh which is like Atari's answer to Mario Kart and them going, uh have we got any characters you can put in a cart that's iconic like Mario? And they're like Uh that fucking bear from Crystal Castles. Um I I will now read out the roster of characters in Atari Kart Matthew.

Samuel
01:08:48
We've got Bentley Bear from the Crystal Castles game, which by the way I did not think was very good. Scully Regius, Pulpito, Mistress, Volky, and Ptarbigan, but it starts with a P, so Petarmigan, perhaps? Um Honestly, the most blorco lineup of all time. Where's like centipede and millipede? That's two. Yeah, you can see them really struggling to make characters happen. Can you? Where's yours? Well why isn't the fucking Yars driving one of these cars, you know?

Matthew
01:09:20
And it and it's also just a dire, dire version of Maria Gart. Um really, really ugly. I thought They had like a they had a thing which the internet described as open world Star Fox called Cybermorph. I thought was absolutely abysmal. It had these t terrible digitized bits of speech. I mean it was a Jaguar game, you know, in uh you know, uh sort of polygonal 3D, so it had you know it looked a little bit more cutting edge than whatever the fuck was going on with Trevor McFer, but Uh again I d I s could yeah, I couldn't really get my head around it, didn't feel nice to play, wasn't interested by it, kept crashing, a weird face kept saying sort of spooky lines in English.

Samuel
01:10:05
No music, I don't think, as well, or like Limited music? I can't remember, but I just remember thinking the soundscape was weird for that game. Yeah.

Matthew
01:10:13
They were they were rough. I think and y what you said earlier was bang on. Because you knew what other people were doing at the same time, you couldn't get that out of your head of like Well, people were playing like Link to the Past while this was happening and goddammit, you know, look at this thing. Also, it being like the most powerful games machine at the time? Like ha wh how? You know? What happened? Yeah. Like why why not have anything to demonstrate that? Or at least what they included in the collection, I'm aware that Jaguar has some a Doompour and Alien vs. Predator and whatnot that are maybe shinier. Yeah, those games were and they were properly rotten. And it just I don't know it Reading the struggles of that machine and then playing these terrible games, you y you just thought, well, I can un I can fully understand why this happened. this way. The weirdest thing in this whole collection, actually not to to keep coming back and dunking on Bentley Bear But the Bentley Bear Sprite in the I can't remember if it's the arcade original or if it is yeah, no, it would be the arcade original because he hasn't got that much detail on his body in the 2600 version. He's wearing an incredibly kinky pair of boots. Like, he's got a really weird energy that character. I was like, what is going on with that? Like They read as like he's wearing like stiletto leather boots which just dis just not connect with or or or the Bentley Bear that I was being sold on the poster for Crystal Castles. And that really stuck with me. Um I really li like I

Samuel
01:11:58
Yeah, that's um that's funny. I mean, the list of stinkers is not um is not short. I mean, I would say that every single Real sports game that was not the volleyball one um was pretty bad. The later tennis one they did was pretty good actually. When I was playing that tennis one, I did think is tennis like the easiest game to do?

Matthew
01:12:18
Because tennis is always pretty good.

Samuel
01:12:20
Yeah, and also it's tennis is j is just pong, basically. Like it's all you're d really doing is adding a few animations to a game you've already made.

Matthew
01:12:27
But it looks cool because it has because you've got the depth of the core, it always has a slightly 3D feel to it, like the the foreground and the background. Like it's just uh it just always works as a game.

Samuel
01:12:38
It's true. The the Real Sport volleyball one I think was was no was notable because they did do uh later version of it on the links, I think, and it it just looked it looked really nice for the limitations of the hardware. Like the you got the very particular sort of beach aesthetic they were going for and it's It's like playing a rougher version of like Windjammus or something, basically. It's like um, you know, sort of similar a vibe to that. And yeah, the the version on um on Lynx is alright. Um, but um yeah, uh it's I've got many other stinkers here. So uh well I think this is not like the worst game, but like Junkyard Dog and then Which is both on both um Lynx and Jaguar. I would say the Lynx version, I mean if you're gonna push it a touch better, but we're talking about the difference to like a maybe a three and a four out of ten game here. Um I mean, when you re when you clock that was happening at the same time as Sonic the Hedgehog, you just feel a bit like aggrieved, I would say. It's sort of like that's That's rough the kid who got junkyard done.

Matthew
01:13:44
It's just a guy in a junkyard throwing coins at cats. Real strange energy to that one.

Samuel
01:13:51
There's a lot of just stuff in in general where you're like, what was behind the There's no strategy behind the software being made here. It's all just ports of stuff you've played a million times already, and then just like some bullshit. Um and it's That would happen over and over again. I mean, yeah, Sword Quest, I agree. I thought terrible, um, to be honest. Um, just I I'm I'm sure there were elements of it that were very exciting at the time. Um, but yeah, not not good um at all. Uh yeah, I think you might actually you might actually have kind of caught most of like the really key ones that jumped out. I mean, I thought that Cybermorph was so awful Um and I was annoyed to read that the sequel was considered quite a lot better um because they addressed a lot of the criticisms, but obviously you know A late in the generation Atari Jaguar game is completely meaningless. Like that's you know, no one bought the console anyway. It sold like under, I think, a quarter of a million units. So It's not like anyone was out there buying the sequel to a launch game that was already terrible. But yeah, like I read a review for s Cybermorph that said It This is ten times worse than Star Fox on the SNES. And like I just thought what a devastating takedown that is. You see the very vague promise of like what basically PS1 kind of almost parity graphics can achieve in a game like that. But then the quality of the experience is so poor, it's kind of shocking. And then it really feels like they just don't make Any effort to ensure that the Jaguar games are good while also having the very cursed controller with loads of fucking buttons at the bottom of it that do nothing. So it looks like a big telephone that's in your hand. Like it's Just oh just incredibly round said.

Matthew
01:15:34
Throughout their history they could never shake the half this controller looks like a TV remote. It's such a weird thing they keep coming back to where it's like you've worked out the hard bit, you know, like the D-pad and a couple of buttons where your thumbs naturally sit. And then they're like, oh yeah, and then there are twelve like numerical buttons in the middle and you're like no what no one wants that this is absolutely insane like what an absolute design dead end to have been stuck in for all that time And and like they talk about other consoles coming out with like equally heinous controllers, which they're like, oh shit, we've gotta make a new controller to we've gotta match this dog shit controller over here. It's just like It's like three idiots all chasing each other's tails while like Nintendo and Sega are just sort of very quietly getting on with it, going, Yeah, let's just strip this right back. Makes perfect sense. Like who needs a controller with like fucking twenty buttons?

Samuel
01:16:34
Yeah, it's it's very true. I mean I will I will confess to like a lot of these games are already leaving my memory. They're exiting because they're just so Unmemorable. There's like a there's a few games in this as well where they're like, oh it's an unreleased prototype, then you play it and it's terrible and you're like, well, well yeah, you know, like that's that's that's what happened. Um I do have like a few honorable mentions for games that I thought were interesting if not amazing. So Canyon Bomber, which is a game where you sort of like drop diagonal bombs to score as many points by like Hitting all these different layers of bricks as you go. Like not amazing, but alright. Um, there's a very rudimentary tic-tac-toe programme in here, which I think uh would have been something that my dad would have played the shit out of, but Again, like I imagine probably quite revolutionary to have that in your li in your living room at the time. The game a game that Mark uh Mark Cerny worked on was uh Major Havoc, which was an arcade game where it's sort of like Tom Francis's heat signature if you've played that, where it's like a sp it's like a sp, I mean uh perhaps over generous there and like a It's that really is two games and one, not like in the um Atari box advertising sense where it's a bit of space combat You awkwardly land your spaceship on um on a on this enemy ship and you go inside, get something, and then have to escape before the ship blows up, basically. Um with some of the worst platforming you've ever played. But the sm and I mean heinous. But um some of the um but the I think the spaceship combat bit was actually good and it had those um those arcade vector graphics which were nice.

Matthew
01:18:14
What is it that you know It happened with Major Havoc and it happens with uh Rogue Squadron III, that they're amazing at the space combat and they understand how a ship works, but the second you become a man They just shit their pants.

Samuel
01:18:29
Yeah, it's so it's so true. But like that was um a great example again of like I you know what that the space combat in that again was better than the combat in um Star Raiders, which I just every time I played a version of that, I was like, why is this so shit? It's just terrible every single time. Um, yeah. I But that probably does end the ones I got really excited about. I suppose like a shout-out for adventure, you could see why that mattered in a pre-Zelder world, but you have no reason to play it now, you know, as being chased by these big chickens as identified by um Cliffy B and um Tim Schaefer as you rudimentary carrying items between rooms. It's not that exciting, but you can see why it mattered, you know. Um

Matthew
01:19:10
Yeah, I thought all the ones which trop which had more of a like narrative concept behind them would get you excited by like You're on an adventure, you're going into a haunted house, and it would inevitably be a load of rectangular rooms with maybe like one ghost in it, and the whole game hinges about understanding a confusing inventory system like when you pick stuff up and drop stuff in different screens. Because Haunted House, for you were like, oh is this gonna be like a proto-resident evil? And it was just about like constructing an urn across three floors.

Samuel
01:19:46
Yeah, that's just probably under underwhelming. Yeah, really just doesn't go anywhere. Um also this compilation was determined to make minor 2049er happen. Oh yeah. And I'm here to tell you no dog, that is never happening. I mean I it just basically a game where you are walking along surfaces, uh in theory mining, these little like bits of the floor below you disappear to suje to show that you've mined that bit of it. While sort of jumping on enemies and then try not to fall down these gaps and then do all the climbing again. Um, not good in any of the versions they presented here. Then I looked it up, Matthew, on Wikipedia. And um there's a there's a bit that said um uh Richard Stanton in his book A Brief History of Video Games 2015 said that minor 2049 was generally forgotten in the wake of Super Mario Bros, 1985. Um but that this is like that's included really as a kind of like, here's an example of one of the actually good um third party games that are being made for the VCS. But then But then and which makes you realise just how bad some of the other product must have been. Like um I would say it starts to make you realize why a video game industry crash might happen if you're being fed excessive dog shit on this machine because When even like it's when its best games seem to just be like a small handful, it just makes you wonder what other horrors were out there. trying to get like twenty thirty dollars from you, you know? So yeah, that came to mind. Um the only other thing I wanted to call out was like a an interesting sort of failure. was the game Basket Brawl, which is definitely not good, but the Atari Lynx version, it's a basketball game where you can like knife the other players during in the in the middle of a match. Just Again, completely unhinged. Would never have happened on Sega or Nintendo's watch, but NBA jam. Exactly, yeah, that's probably what they were going for. So That's pretty much all I've got to say on the games, Matthew. So um yeah. I mean I but I did enjoy still the kind of like it was like playing shit UFO fifty a lot of the time, you know? So Okay, uh which I guess is what they were going for with UFO fifty anyway. Um, okay, so I was wondering if you had any top line observations from that about The different areas of Atari as presented here. Um and can I ask what you thought if the the cautionary tales were to come out of the Atari story?

Matthew
01:22:10
Like I mentioned earlier, definitely how crucial the handover moment is between consoles, you know, whether you support an old machine, how you treat it, what the new machine should do. The uh you know, answering questions about backwards compatibility. You know, maybe not reflected so much in the games, because a lot of the games were just the same between the machines as they were presented in in the collection. But in terms of the actual like information in the museum, the thing it seemed most hung up on was like where did it go wrong? What did we what did we You know, did we identify the wrong part of this machine? Um I thought it was quite interesting actually when they talked about the the home PCs bit, the the 400 and the 800s. they were saying like, you know, we were trying to kind of position this to be a like you say competitor to to the the Apple II. Um but you know, internally, like, we were just interested in making games on it that we'd already made you know, they were just you know, everyone kind of involved in this collection anyway, was interested in the game side of it and um you just get the feeling like people weren't all kind of necessarily pulling in the same direction. Um there's a lot of like us and them anecdotes about bad management decisions and then the people actually kind of like trying to make something of what they get given. Um yeah, I'd I'd say that was like the that was the the thing that jumped out in terms of, you know, like Whenever even now when a console generation changes it's a bit of a sort of hold your breath moment, you know? Because it can it's it's where everything can go wrong and where there's everything to play for if the last generation wasn't good for you. Um And yeah, just seeing them have no previous experience, like what it is to make those decisions when no one's ever made those decisions before. I I thought that was That was like a good cautionary tale.

Samuel
01:24:10
Yeah, absolutely. I think it's just making sure that your um your hardware proposition is coherent and like that that people understand what it is that's being sold to them. Because I think with the uh is it the 5200 have I got that right? Um is it I I just want to double check I'll get that right actually before I keep talking because it'll be really annoying otherwise if I get that wrong. Uh it was a 5200. Is that I think um they say in the documentary that basically it was similar in spec to the PCs that they were already selling and therefore didn't represent enough of a leap to the people, um people at home, um, the consumers. And so it wa it only sold like a million units, you know, c relative to its predecessor, which sold thirty million, and they kept making games for its predecessor. And so It was a it's an it was annoying to watch them make these mistakes because I will admit to watching it and thinking I kind of I kind of was rooting for them in some ways. You know, I want I like the idea that They say that it's kind of like a a precursor to Silicon Valley in some ways, that when, you know, when they were making this stuff, like this was uh innovation in America. America were like the leaders on this stuff. And, you know, that just Uh that must have seemed very exciting in the moment and then very heartbreaking when it was over. When they have um a final interview with Nolan Bushnell in this, he talks about the idea that for more than twenty years, Satari has been in the hands of people who don't look after it or care about it. And it's a bit like, well, who fucking sold it to Warner in the first place? Like why did that happen? Because you know, it just all these things that t seem to contribute to like bad decision making, like you say, people not pulling in the right direction. Just kind of a bummer. And I hated seeing them flame out with the Jaguar in the way they did. I was like, what is this piece of shit console? Like look at the hardware be like this is so bad. Why are these games so bad? Like they talk about how the company's on its last legs, but we're gonna take one last shot at making a console. So why wouldn't you make the games for it? Good? Why would you not look at the snares? and the Mega Drive and be like, well that's as good as we need to be. If we can't make games as good as that, we've got no business being in this industry. And so That's another causary tale really. It's the lack of self-awareness, you know, um behind some of those those decisions. Um yeah. When I played Fight for Life on Jaguar, Matthew, which is a beat-em-up that was incredibly slow and boring. I just couldn't help thinking that Tekken, which was out around the same time, felt like the moon landing by comparison. Like these are like cavemen, and that they were like, yeah, landing on the fucking moon. I mean, yeah. So That was that was so bad.

Matthew
01:26:42
I showed I to sort of sort of bookend Catherine's experience with Atari fifty, I showed her that today. um at lunchtime because I thought oh you'll get a kick out of this. I think s someone who worked on Virtual Fighter was involved apparently. Yeah that's right. Yeah. And so it kind of has some uh you know, it looks a little bit sort of virtufied or tek and adjacent, much worse. Uh I thought it was baffling that the health bars only appear when you attack someone. Like you can't see with how little health they've got until you're punching them. And all the characters were called things like Steve and Ian. Like no not like not like you know, Ian Mercury or something. It was just Ian. Uh and so Catherine was watching me just kick a man called Ian in the head while his health bar occasionally popped up. It was so slow. Felt like I was kicking him in the head for like three minutes and he still hadn't died.

Samuel
01:27:34
It came out it came out in nineteen ninety-six. How is that even possible? Like Tekken came out in nineteen ninety four then on ninety five i ninety five in PlayStation, like Oh shocking.

Matthew
01:27:46
It is that that was a r that was a real shocker. I saved the Jagular stuff too last I thought, oh that'd be like a treat. You know? I know that's got a bit more juice. Let's see what they were doing. And then you see it and you're like, oh no. So I played it before I read the museum about it, and then I read the museum was like, yeah, that's right

Samuel
01:28:05
Yeah, and again they just see you know the best stuff ends up being all these games they designed like almost twenty years earlier in some cases, you know? So You know, they ha they have like uh uh I did you play the very unconvincing um three D version of Missile Command?

Matthew
01:28:20
Oh that was terrible.

Samuel
01:28:22
Yeah, that was rough. That was.

Matthew
01:28:36
very important task in my hands.

Samuel
01:28:37
I was gonna ask you, did you ever play a a port of one of the arcade games where you were like genuinely impressed by, oh it's cool that they got this to work on this? Did that ever happen when you were playing these?

Matthew
01:28:47
Not really, but well I not to my eyes, though having watched them talk about how hard it was to program games for the 2600, like There's there's qu what one of the best bits of this actually is is them sort of breaking down like exactly like what a a weird kind of thing it was to work with. And they're like anything working on this is like a minor miracle. So if it looks like or behaves anything close to these much more powerful bits of arcade hardware, that was just so unlikely. you know, and the fact that people stuck with it and squeezed some quite uh you know quite ambitious things from it over the course of like whatever fifteen twenty years. Um Yeah, I I kind of I i I felt a little bit uh uh not bad for it, but I uh y y y you could have some appreciation of what was going on, you know. Y it wasn't just a load of old shit where I thought, well that was a load of old shit. Why didn't they make better things? You're like, oh I understand why why things were the way they were.

Samuel
01:29:53
Yeah, for sure. I sort of um I felt bad for some of these guys as well who had designed these games that, you know, revolutionized an industry and then like by the late 80s, like you know, barely a decade later, were looking for work in some cases or founded new companies. Like the The guys who left Atari um to go um co-found Activision and then like were basically out of work after the crash. That's very modern games industry coded, I would say. Um there's not the the you know the sheer volume of games I guess is maybe a comparison point, but otherwise, you know, obviously the landscape today is completely unrecognisable. But there was a bit of a like guys chewed up in the machinery element of this story that I thought was kind of compelling throughout, you know, because a lot of these guys' successes are only really remembered by you know, people over the age of fifty. You a the likes of you and I are never really talking about David Crane in any rede real detail, do you know what I mean? But that's a significant person to people who read Retro Gamer magazine, for example. One of the last things I wanted to ask you and I kinda know the answer to this already, Matthew, really, so I don't know you know why I'm bothering, but were there any games missing on here you were curious about playing?

Matthew
01:31:02
I guess like the Nintendo ports. Um I would have been interested to see those, just see what was going on there. Um there is this Activision shaped hole in the game. Like there's a bit in the museum where they're like Activision made amazing games for twenty six hundred. Bye! And you're like, oh, okay, we're not gonna get to see any of those. Um but we do get to see Crystal Castles and those kinky kinky boots. Um so uh Ye like I'd say the holes feel pretty obvious. I don't have the knowledge or the specialist knowledge to know if there are like hidden gems missing. I did look at a couple of best Atari 2600 lists and best Jaguar lists to see if there are any titles that you know weren't on here and there seem to be a you know a few obvious ones like like I said, Doom and and um Alien vs Predator on the Jaguar. But any that jumped out to you is like, oh I would have killed to have played X. Well, there's no kill to have played as such, but I would say Alien vs.

Samuel
01:32:01
Predator on Jaguar would be my number one for sure because Everyone says first person shooter. Obviously, we know there's a a great later PC version by Rebellion as well. But Would love to just see the see that running on this. That would have been cool. And um yeah, I I share your curiosity about the Doom and Wolfenstein ports. Uh from the 2600, I would say Pitfall was the main one I wanted to try because I it was actually really helpful to contextualize what is pitfall and why does pitfall matter. And when you realise how rudimentary a lot of the kind of adventure shapes games or anything resembling that were on this system, you realize why something like Pitfall would have been a big success. Um and then yeah, like Pac-Man I'd like to see running on here, they are putting out a collection. of Namco games. I'm not sure that's got enough pull to me for for me to buy that compilation, but nicer completionists. Like you know, a similar Activision collection would probably go down really well, I imagine, with people who or you know, maybe understand these games a little better than we do. Um the vector arcade version of Star Wars would have been lovety lovely to have on here. Um would have been amazing to get that on here, but I understand why obviously I believe that that was actually included at as well as its Empire Strikes Back and Return of the GLI variants on one of the Rogue Leader games on GameCube is an extra Matthew. So I learned that while researching this. Um Yeah, the Doom and Wolfenstein ports, I wouldn't mind seeing other Jaguar. I I was very just very curious about the Jaguar. I was a a PlayStation and Saturn contemporary that was that was doomed, but still had a fair few games on it. So Wouldn't mind just seeing a few more of of that because yeah, like I say it's a bit closer to what I recognize in terms of modern games. Um Defender 2000, which is another of the Jeff Minter games that are on here, and I think it was a similar kind of like Up rares and stuff. That wasn't on the Jeff Minter um collection they did either, which makes me think that game might be lost to time in some way or or something like that. Because yeah, why would you not have it here? Um and like I say, I would I would like to play the sequel to Cybermorph to see if it's any better, Battle Morph. Um but that um that was not included obviously. So yeah. But otherwise, I don't know. It was comprehensive enough for your boy basically. Um Yeah, so one of my other final questions here, Matthew, are there any series or developers you'd like to see get the digital eclipse treatment based on what you've played here?

Matthew
01:34:15
The access and everything is you know, you'd like to hear this this level of storytelling around pretty much anyone I would uh you know I'd I'd be interested in. Um Maybe in terms of like some like British publishers you could probably do this with. Maybe do like the Team 17 story or um maybe like Cygnosis.

Samuel
01:34:36
Yeah, oh Cygnosis is a really good shout actually. Like that's I would imagine they'd be interested in a developer like that as well.

Matthew
01:34:41
Yeah, I'm just 'cause they were like uh you know, I know it's not quite the same thing as like we were also a hardware manufacturer, but Anyone who's gone through several generations and has like changed or or you know, had to had to undergone big changes to kind of s you know, keep up with the times and change their output and their style and what is the through line, you know, what it what is there you know, missile command that's always there or, you know, what is the thing that kind of ties these things together. Um yeah, I'd probably be be into that. I think they've been like Uh I think Team 17 have put anniversary editions of things which have had sub supplementary materials like this, but um

Samuel
01:35:22
Yeah, there's a Digital Eclipse Worms collection, I believe. Oh my god, or well Worms Armageddon. Ash worked on it.

Matthew
01:35:28
Oh right, yeah, well there you go. Yeah, so you know that that that's that stuff always works. Yeah, those ones jump out saying, Oh, Nintendo, I mean you know, i I just don't you know, that's just not a thing that's gonna sort of happen. I feel like Nintendo are curating their own history, where rightly or wrongly and however you feel about it, you know, but they are So putting that stuff out there. You just have to fly around the halfway round the world to a literal museum to see it.

Samuel
01:35:53
Yeah, it's not like you're really gonna get a guy going, oh yeah, I was eating a lot of convenience store chicken when I made ice climbers. Like that's not gonna you're not gonna hear those anecdotes.

Matthew
01:36:02
You are getting these people who Uh retiring, like you know, people who've been at Nintendo the whole time, like the Star Fett Fox uh character artist chap who did the r like the interview rounds this last year because he made that that game under his own steam and with that suddenly came like a big batch of well here's how X, Y, and Z worked at Nintendo Um so maybe like more of that will happen. This did m remind me that maybe not from a history lesson in terms of the stories behind the games, but uh I think Rare Replay did a pretty good version. You know, oat was a pretty good attempt to document a company. I actually think Rare Buryplay did a better job than Atari 50 of making me like understand the individual games by sp specifically the older games by like drawing out little like mini games and tutorials and that they kind of helped you find the fun in them in in a way where you're just kind of left to your own devices in Atari 50. Um w which is maybe a different approach, but I did I did like that

Samuel
01:37:04
Yeah, I I it made me want to actually I've not I've never like given Rare Replay a proper go. I've just played the games individually and this definitely made me want to check that out and see what the deal is because yeah that I think that context would be would be good see how they do it.

Matthew
01:37:18
Yeah. Um those games are way better than a lot of these games as well. Like they're just off that era slight you know, ten years later that everything is just a little bit better.

Samuel
01:37:26
Gotcha, yeah, okay, interesting. Uh it's Mr. Pants isn't included, is it, Matthew? I mean, uh I I assume not, but uh um Um Yeah, so I um I would say I agree with you about Cygnosis. I think that This would actually be a really good way to for Sega to put out a new compilation of stuff um would be to have this kind of format. You could just do this You could do it in like um in parts maybe. You could do probably one that is Master System and Mega Drive, then one that is Dreamcast and um oh and then one that is Saturn. I think you could probably do it that way and th they would each sell and think people would really appreciate that and they are a bit more in the realm of they talk about They have their older developers out there, they talk about this stuff. Well, quite a lot of this stuff is known. Like they do a lot of, you know, retro gamer covers and and things. Like uh I've known them to be quite open with access. I think they'd be perfect for this. Um uh treasure would be great for this, because they've kind of stopped making games as well. And you know, I think feasibly a lot those games would fit on to one compilation as well, but there's just enough of them where You could have some great, you know, in-depth storytelling about each one. Um if you've got that like um McDonald's or Burger King game, whatever it is they made on there, that'd be really fun, for example. But so I'm my hope is that they just that these collections have become successful enough that maybe they're getting approached by people. Like they're doing Mortal Kombat next, I believe, and that's collecting a load of old kind of like ports and things like that. And they've got, you know, a load of um uh sort of behind the scenes material for that they're putting together and so yeah I it's a great little venture. It's really you know it's sort of it's quite close to what journalism is in some ways. But um Yeah, so I'd I'd love to see more more like this for sure. Um and my final question, Matthew, is um finally, um Atari twenty six hundred Ye or um Donkey Kong or Donkey Kong Bonanza, which would you rather play in 2025? This won't surprise you, but it's Donkey Kong Bonanza. I did feel bad for the guy in this who says Everyone always pulls up the you know like the first screen of Donkey Kong on um VCS and says, what a piece of shit, but you didn't know what I was working with. I love that little annie doing this. Uh refelt for him. That had big big print magazine energy, I would say. Well the episode is over, Matthew. Thank you for taking this journey with me. I'm glad it didn't, you know I'm sorry um that it claimed one of Catherine's evenings, but I'm glad that you um It didn't ruin your week off at the end of the day. No, no, no, no.

Matthew
01:39:50
And I I'm pleased I got to see Bentley Bear in his weird boots.

Samuel
01:39:54
Um Bentley Bear the star of Atari Karts. Um and uh The second XL episode that we're doing later this month, um, the pop culture one, is about Mad Men Season 1. Matthew, I think, has enjoyed researching that um more than he has this episode. So I look forward to diving into some of the characters from that one. But thank you very much for your support. We are talking about doing something similar, maybe with the um the games, the NES games that are on Nintendo Switch Online Obviously a slightly different proposition than what Atari 50 is, but um playing a bunch of old games in an afternoon and talking about them, that might be something we do um pretty soon. So look forward to that. Matthew, let's get out of here. The episode's done. Goodbye.
