Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew, when we spoke the other day, you told me you had uh an update for me on JC's Kitchen, which for newer listeners is a place in Bath that sells meat more consistently now than it previously did. The long-running joke with this place was that despite the food being very, very good You couldn't depend on him to be there. Um but in the last year or so he's definitely changed his ways. He's there very regularly in Bar City Centre. And it seems like he's got a bit of an audience going on. But um You went there and had observations on uh on how it's been going lately. What's the uh what's the latest?

Matthew
01:02
Well so my big question was why is he no longer doing bubble and squeak? 'Cause that used to be his thing. Sort of grilled chicken with bubble and squeak and some nice sauces. It's sort of in it done in in a sort of Philippine style. And I sort of asked him, well, oh, didn't you used to do bubble and squeak? So I didn't want it, you know, just in case there was like drama behind it. Um didn't want him to think I was like negging him. And um He wa he s he explained to me, said he said, well we did, but then we got uh the council moved our tent to the bottom of town where it currently is, outside McDonald's. And he says around here it's mostly student footfall and students don't know what bubble and squeak is, so I had to change the loaded fries. That is bleak.

Samuel
01:46
What a bleak update. Damning of bar students, really. Um do they really just does Jen Alpha really not understand what bubble and squeak is?

Matthew
01:59
He also said like you know, the cost of living crisis, the amount of power it takes to boil thirty kilos of potatoes every day, like is quite pricey. Yeah, that makes sense.

Samuel
02:09
I did assume it was a bit of a Cosie Lives based thing based on the fact that during the pandemic his food was getting closer to the £10 mark and it might have just tipped over. And I feel like he's been doing everything to keep it down a little bit. So um The chips allow him to do that to Matthew. So uh it it sounds like it's working out alright though for uh uh for old JC. I had the loaded fries.

Matthew
02:29
They were fine, like the bubbling squeak was next level for me, so that is a shame, but I can also sort of understand and you know, he didn't sound very happy about his positioning in town, which is obviously on the council. So yeah, there ends this true crime episode.

Samuel
02:46
Yeah, um real case files, JC's kitchen. I appreciate the update. I mean I feel like he's got a prime position in town compared to where he was on Bog Island, which is basically like I've basically like being given real estate on the DLC Island of Fable 2. It like it's might it might as well not exist.

Speaker 3
03:03
On on the main map of Buff. So um I tell you what, I bet the citizens of Albion know what bubble and squeak is though.

Samuel
03:10
Is it bad that Fable was my only go to reference there?

Matthew
03:13
No, that's fine, I think one location that's far away from other locations.

Samuel
03:16
I think it was a DLC Island in that game, but uh Yes, I'd have to go back and check really. But here we are, Matthew, the final regular episode of the year. After this, we are not coming back until January 9th for a regular episode. There will be a Patreon episode that goes up on the 31st of December, which is our favourite TV shows and films of the year, the XXL episode. So that will happen. But otherwise we're going to have a little pause just to replenish and prepare for some of the pods that we're doing early next year, including two giant men, um play GTA 4, three giant men in fact, because we plan to have Jeremy Peel join us for that one. So here we go, Matthew. We're wrapping up again for the year. And um wow, I feel like we we take the prep for this episode more seriously than we ever have. Um each year it just seems to escalate the amount of work that goes into it. How are you feeling about it?

Matthew
04:02
I definitely agree with that assessment. It feels like every year we try and just cram more and more in so that we can have I don't even know what we're calling it, a comprehensive, not correct, list of best games of the year. But I have also heard Game of the Year podcasts which are like eight hours long and I think, well that's like there must have been a lot of work must have gone into the recording for eight hours. And we're not doing that. Maybe we should be, the amount of time we put into the games, maybe we should be aiming more for the 6-7 mar. I don't think so.

Samuel
04:33
I think like by th by hour three It gets weird and we start flagging. And uh I just don't see what could be accomplished in the bad lands that lie beyond hour three, you know?

Matthew
04:42
I get that. I do get that. Um yeah, but in terms of I don't think the madness has gripped me as much this year actually I'd I you know, I looked at what I had and we looked at what I hadn't played and there were just some things which, you know, could have been contenders that seemed so out of reach that I didn't even bother, where in previous years I might have like Chucked in a couple of hours just to see if they were worth it.

Samuel
05:03
Yeah, I think I agree with that. I um I definitely feel like I played at I think I played upwards of I think four or five games for 30 hours or more, which is more than I would typically do. But, you know, I did the games I did play, I I played comprehensively, and I thought that was a better approach to to finish about fifteen to twenty games um in that bracket rather than try and play thirty-five to forty games, but have a bit of a superficial uh sort of like perspective on those games, which I definitely think in 2020-2021 I had a cut I had a few games that I could describe that way. But um yes, these days I take it very seriously. We do all the what we've been playing pods throughout the year, which it gives us the ammunition we need really to to do this episode. Justice. Um so yeah, I thought about this all week to be honest. I've been counting down to it. And to be honest, I also thought I'd have an extra month of evenings to focus on this than I did, but um December ended up being an absolutely jam-packed month so I actually haven't had much time this month to play things. So because you just had to go to Gav Murphy's special party. I didn't regret it. I had a very good time and you were much missed, Matthew. Did you regret not going to that?

Matthew
06:12
Yeah, because I was having a really rough day at work and just getting like a fun message from you going like how fun it was.

Speaker 3
06:19
Didn't and I think I got a message from you saying, Oh yeah, someone just put a tube to my ear and yelled at it.

Samuel
06:24
Yeah, that wasn't great. Yeah, not ideal that. Um not not what you want really in the Christmas period or indeed in any period really matter.

Matthew
06:31
If you'd put a split screen of like you laughing away with Simon Parkin compared to me having someone shriek in my ear through a tube. Like I don't think you could have a more dramatic golf in experiences.

Speaker 3
06:46
Yeah, that's true. I I feel like I and I think I only spoke to Simon for about fifty fifteen minutes, but it was lovely to um to catch up with it.

Samuel
06:51
Oh I bet I bet it was a nourishing fifteen though. It was. um and uh podcast host and talk to him a bit. It was actually really nice to be honest. Um there were other people there. John Hicks was there, um pe previous podcast guest. Andy Robinson was there from VGC. And after several beers, I think I brokered some kind of agreement, Matthew, where They would come on our podcast. So one of them would come on our podcast and we would go on their podcast. Like a hostage swap. It's a little bit of that, yeah. And so um and he was like, Oh we're gonna email you January 2nd about this. And I was like, okay I look forward to it. So that might be happening next year. Um so um you can look forward to that. Um but yeah, and then I dashed off to have another Christmas dinner in a different part of London. And uh that was quite a day for me. Next day felt terrible. Oh two dinners. That's what they call you. It's almost as if humans aren't supposed to have four thousand calories in a space of about twelve hours, but um I pushed that to its very limit. Um so yeah that was nice and um in exchange fo I have no takes to offer the listeners on the Outer Worlds 2, which is what I could have been doing instead. Um, but but I failed you on that front. I didn't finish Baby Steps either. So Um I'm afraid what I've got is what I've got, but I really did put the um the time in to try and get a list that I was happy with and I I do I do finally have one. I chopped and changed loads. um across the past few weeks, just re-examining, playing little bits and pieces here and there, watching little bits of it and just being like, Oh yeah, I did like that.

Matthew
08:14
Or oh yeah, it's a bit cooler on that.

Samuel
08:16
Um yeah.

Matthew
08:16
So ironic is when you were talking about not playing Outer Worlds 2, two dinners sounds like one of those negative perks you could get in the game. your character is always carrying around the extra weight of two dinners.

Samuel
08:28
What what's that game where you can get you get given like a a nickname in sort of invert commas and then I feel like it'd be Samuel Two Dinners Roberts in in that RPG. Which which game am I thinking of when I mean this quite country? Yeah. I can't I ca I you know what it's not coming.

Matthew
08:48
Hello two dinners. Should we go for a drive?

Samuel
08:51
That'd be perfect. Hopefully they'll implement that for uh Forza Horizon 6. That'd be great. Um yeah, old Samuel Samuel 2 dinners while driving around Japan would actually be like quite accurate from my experience of going there. So that'd be good. So Matthew, the big question, was 2025 a great year for games or merely a good one?

Matthew
09:09
I think it was a good year rather than a great one. For me personally. But it maybe felt more exciting to others if you were a fully on board the Claire Obscure train, B live for Hades and Hollow Knight, or C a more open to online multiplayer. uh none of which are true for me. So yeah, I d I f I f I feel like there was a lot of buzz and there was a lot of excitement, but I was outside of the tent for a lot of it. I think the discussion around games has been pretty funky this year. Like I f I feel like I've heard more about the n the narrative around certain games than I have the games themselves. I don't know if that's just like a general sign of the times, or like you know, the particular batch of games we had, you know, maybe that's ever more efficient algorithm doing its thing, or games media being a bit more squeezed than it was, or just people generally feeling a bit more stressed, tired and angry. But uh yeah, I feel like the the discussions around games have felt quite quite small. A lot of interesting stuff that I've just not seen mentioned or discussed at all. But I think if you did keep your head down and sort of stay focused on the sort of matter at hand, you know, actually kind of playing lots of games and thinking about lots of games. So I think there is there's loads of really interesting stuff. I mean I was always playing good games. I just don't know if I ever played anything that was like you know, a ten out of ten for me and spent most of the year just being sort of annoyed about the s the state of the conversation around games. It's it's how I feel about the year in a nutshell.

Samuel
10:51
Yeah, I think that's very well put, to be honest. I think, you know, there is far too much discourse around the creation of games and The finances of games as bitched about on last week's um podcast about the uh yeah, that was my worst discourse of the year, game budgets, where people are arguing and they don't even have all the information. That was really dumb this year that that that that happened. And it kept happening and then it happened again at the end of the year somehow. It came back. Um so, you know, the at least welcome return of a discourse, if there was an additional award, I would g also give that to game budgets. Um yeah, I agree. I think there's a little bit of like Because the industry's had such a harrowing few years, it's sort of like the the the sort of cloud that hangs over it, I think, drives some of this conversation as you identify there. Like it you can't help but feel like there is a certain amount of distress. And so maybe in feeling like you're talking about the you know, the the thinking behind certain decisions or whatever, that somehow you are diagnosing that distress in some way or you're coming to terms with it because You're trying to understand a little bit why one thing might work, but something doesn't work, why this thing happened, why this thing, you know, didn't happen the way it should have done, whatever it might be. I do think that the the endless layoffs just um have created a sort of industry obsession with itself that is definitely feels noisier than it did previously. And um but in terms of the overall games I do agree. I think that This was a year where I think it would have been quite easily easy for um the likes of uh Silksong and Hades 2 to set the narrative on the indie game side and just come in and sweep those Game of the Year awards. and just really kind of take over. And it I don't think it quite happened that way, to be honest. I think uh you know, a a bunch of games that no one really saw coming as game of the year contenders. um sort of like came along and um shook things up and I think that that has made for a more interesting year. That said, I do agree with you that almost everything on my list is a bit of an eight out of ten to me. Like it's not I've got two I think like nines I could be talked into in positions one and two. But then the rest are eights without a doubt. Um so yeah, that's that feels weaker than last year where I would have said that Indiana Jones, Astrobot, Dragon's Dogma 2 were all nines for me. Um yeah, I mean maybe like um Dragon's Dogma was more of a a flawed eight, but it was my favorite game of that year, certainly. Um so yeah, um this year not quite as straightforward. Reminds me a bit of that um twenty twenty one uh year where We had like uh some really cool indies and then like Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok, but otherwise it felt like COVID kicked loads of games down the tracks. Um And so on the blockbuster side. Um and even though there were plenty of blockbusters this year, um, they weren't the games that necessarily um stood out in all cases. Some certainly did. Um but others did not. So I agree, Matthew. Good year, not great year is that we're not going to be able to do that.

Matthew
13:47
While I'd say, you know, there's probably like eighty percent crossover between all the lists, the remaining twenty percent. Th there's always something quite interesting. Like it I I don't think I've read a list where there hasn't been something which I just I've not seen anywhere else or maybe not even heard of and so I feel like that stuff is happening. It's we always bang on about like discoverability challenges and and whatnot, you know, when there's so many things happening. But, you know, I think there is a definitely an interesting you know, shelf of things, which also suggests that there's loads of other stuff outside those lists, you know, which we can sort of, you know, uncover over the next, you know, year to come or whatever.

Samuel
14:29
Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, speaking of the year to come, it is absolutely stacked next year. So obviously we have Grand Theft Auto Six coming at the end of next year. That has moved um from uh its original release date in spring. We have 007 First Light, new fire emblem, uh new gears of war. They think they confirmed that um E Day is coming out in a in a post on social media in the last week or so. So That is definitely happening next year. We know Fable's coming along next year as well, because that got delayed. Saros, the spiritual um sequel to uh Returnal as well from House Mark. So I think myself and Matthew might dig into Returnal a little bit ahead of that game. Might be a cool thing to talk about that we've never really discussed before. And um Wolverine is coming next year as well from Insomniac. Um even though in my head I'm a little bit like that's got the possibility of slipping because it's at the very end of next year. Hopefully not. But um yes, curious about that one. Um Forza Horizon 6, as mentioned, there's a new Onamusha game next year, which is very exciting for me, of course. Um Pragmata for all the the Xbox 360 siccos out there, um like myself and Matthew. Um new Resident Evil coming very early next year, Requiem. Um now with um slightly aged Leon S. Kennedy, who actually still looks younger than me, um despite the fact he's supposed to be like the old man version, but um has met numerous many fewer crags than me Um even though he started working at that police station in nineteen ninety eight um as a grown man and I was a ten year old boy. That's tough. Um Judas next year, um this there are two Star Wars games next year, a racer g uh Star Wars racer game that just got announced, the game awards. And Zero Company, which is basically XCOM with clone uh soldiers. I'm looking forward to that immensely. Uh Tomb Raider remake and a Halo remake as well. Plus loads of Nintendo stuff we don't even know about yet, Matthew. Um so when it comes to Blockbusters, I did want to get your thoughts on this year. And I guess like looking ahead and looking back how this year sits next to 2024 and 2026.

Matthew
16:22
I wouldn't say it's been like a killer blockbuster, not being, you know, hugely into the whole kind of hollow night thing, which I know felt massive when it arrived, people who who were into to Silksong. Uh and the multiplayer thing, you know, I feel like there were some quite big hitters, some very shiny, expensive looking things, sort of taking multiplayer by storm, but that's just not a like a world I'm part of at all. So um to me it you know it felt it felt quite small. Certainly in this kind of traditional sense. And it's weird 'cause Nintendo put out loads of stuff, but uh they were all like a little bit odd or a little bit kind of quirky in some way and so They didn't necessarily have you know, I don't think they had like a a ten out of ten in the pack anywhere um to do some heavy lifting. Um Sony's lineup didn't do a vast amount for me and you know, Xbox in terms of like Xbox traditional sort of you know in-house first party games is pretty much non-existent this year. So Yeah, it's like it's it's not really been uh it's I mean certainly not compared to that, you know, embarrassment of single-player riches for next year.

Speaker 3
17:33
Um this year's bit felt pr pretty thin. I don't know if if you experienced the same. In recent years I've come to depend on indie games or third party developers to provide those experiences more maybe more so than I

Samuel
17:46
uh ever had in previous generations where I feel like they really you know, I don't I don't feel like I've had a moment this generation with PlayStation games, for example, like playing Spider-Man or Uncharted 4 or God of War from last generation. Certainly impressive games along the way, and I think there is potential for them to get something like that out before the end of the generation, but it might just be a bit of familiarity at this point because you know, the the these games are all in a kind of similar character driven mold. Um, you know, they they are all distinct in terms of their mechanics, but There are certainly a a sort of character-driven elements to these games that has come to define that whole um Sony sort of like bracket of single-player games. And on the Nintendo side, it's a bit sporadic. There's there's usually like one to two uh Nintendo games in my in my list each year. And this year there is only one, but it is a game that I thought was was re was really impressive and did not make me regret buying a a Nintendo Switch to um without revealing what that very obvious game is. But Yeah, there's certainly um a couple of things along the way where I've been a bit like, ah, that's not quite um that didn't quite hit the way I wanted it to. And that thing of I couldn't have predicted at the start of the year what the key games from this year would have been. You know, I I've I've gone out of my way really to challenge what I see as my sort of homeland genres. You know, I I put less time into Ghost of Yote, a game I'll go back to. in order to play some types of games that I'm just not I wouldn't typically have really checked out or given any time. Um but that's because I feel like uh the podcast is better if I sort of like embrace that more experimental philosophy on playing games as opposed to just sticking to my stomping ground.

Speaker 3
19:25
Yes and no. I s I still think there's a lot of value in hearing a Absolutely rock solid take on the most mainstream game of the year.

Samuel
19:33
Oh yeah, I completely agree. And I think I've got a couple of those. in my list for sure. Like it's not a list of really obscure things. In fact, um if anything I still feel like despite my best efforts I had a I have a pretty superficial uh sort of like picture of the year and what I've played because I look at some of these other game of the year lists and there are games that I've uh not got around to still Matthew and Roger didn't do that yet um My guy my guy Rog just left in the he left in limbo there, that's tough. Um and quite a few of the other sort of like slightly interesting weird things that uh you enjoyed this year. I've not really had the time to check out, like them the root trees are dead, um, which is a game I have seen a bit of discussion of in this game of the year period, one of the very first sort of claimed games of the year. Um sort of like, you know, something that really captured people's imaginations and was talked about early on. Um or like um the seance of Blake Mana, which I expect to be in your list. That's another game that I will play at some point, um, but didn't get time for. So um I try my best, but uh it is tough to play everything. Um but yes, where those games come from Just is endlessly surprising to me. You just never know. Like, despite me reading out all those blockbusters there, I bet the best game of next year If it's not GTA 6 is something that we don't even know is coming yet. I bet that's that's gonna happen again. And I bet that'll keep happening as the as the years go on. Um, you know, and but uh but at the same time I would also love it if my list next year has seven of those games in it. That'd be really cool because I want all of those games to be good. Um so Fingers crossed. Um, okay, so Matthew, the other thing I wanted to ask was the Switch 2 launched this year and I mean when we talk about narratives, the making and selling of things, bogging things down, the tariffs chatter around Switch 2 was maybe the most boring thing I've ever lived through. Yeah, on on sort of like social media and media more generally. It was a very real concern because play-doh US government just doing random bullshit. That's it's a completely fair narrative to um to sort of like have out there, but it was also really boring. And I think there's a bit of skepticism around the Switch too, and certainly around the pricing of the Switch to And yet, now as people start to fear console prices and gaming PC component prices rising next year, I think a games console where the price starts with a three um is actually gonna be quite um quite welcome in the months to come. And it seems like the Switch 2 is doing gangbusters. But I feel like as our, you know, resident Nintendo head, I wanted to kind of get your Your sort of like overall picture of how the Switch 2 did this year.

Matthew
22:00
I I'm I'm re I'm really pleased with it. I really like it. I'm I'm really happy I got one at launch and I've I've really enjoyed the games for it. Um I wouldn't say I feel like vindicated, like I didn't necessarily think it was gonna be like a you know a ten out of ten experience and there were definitely sort of questions hanging over it and these things are only as ever good as as the games and thankfully it's had a uh you know a couple of real winners I'd say. But the numbers and the s the sales of its success surprised me a little bit. Cause I feel like it's kind of quietly getting on with being like massive in the background rather than necessarily feeling like a huge thing that that's like constantly at the front of your mind and You know, I don't know if that's just because they haven't had like one clear out and out sort of 10 out of 10 legendary Nintendo title kind of level game. to kind of like dominate the conversation this year, you know, or just if people have come to it in drips and drabs, like it's always very pleasing to see people on the Discord picking it up, you know, in the last couple of weeks and I've seen a lot of s well satisfied customers. I've not seen many people say like, oh I really regret this. And I think a lot of people have. that kind of uh instant reaction of oh this is nice it feels good in the hands, you know it's worth the money and I don't know, maybe the the the story of the Switch 2 launch is like more one of relief rather than excitement.

Speaker 3
23:28
Yeah. Is maybe the vibe around it.

Matthew
23:30
I don't know, that's like good enough. Uh and particularly when Like you know, I feel like there was quite a lot of negative abuzz around it and you know if there is a negative narrative you know that you can latch on to, you know, people will absolutely milk it and Th there's been so many with Switch 2, you know, the game cards, the lack of a pack-in, the price, is the screen very good, is the mouse unnecessary? you know, if the e every angle has been like f fully explored. But almost despite all that, I think people still come away thinking, like, yeah, it's pr this is pretty good and I quite like the games on it and I'm I'm having a good time on it and it it seems to you know, be comfortably picking up where the Switch One left off and sort fulfilling the same kind of role. It would be great if, you know, they could speed up the process of getting more indie developers on there and you do hear a lot of chatter. about people struggling to get their games on that platform and that's a bummer because the Switch One was beginning to feel quite kind of tired with you know where people were aiming their games sort of technologically and I think the Switch 2 could handle handle a lot of things more comfortably, so I hope they sort that out. But I mean I don't know, I've liked the cadence of the games, I've liked the quality of the games, I've liked the variety of them. Uh I think they've done a pretty good job balancing like new stuff and updating the right series where they maybe don't have something to say, you know, so giving you very shiny versions of like Kirby and Zelda, you know, that'll do for now. I think the Switch Online service has been like pretty well supported, like the GameCube selection is already quite interesting. So yeah, it's just lots of like small little victories. The one thing I d definitely don't like about this era of Nintendo is how reliant they are on that that terrible app to sort of talk about themselves. Like I feel like they're constantly releasing this little piecemeal news announcements or things which would be better kind of gathered in like one juicy hit the conversation never really gets to explode, like they're always just kind of sort of updating it as it goes along and it it it feels it feels quite sort of unflashy and not particularly fun to me. You know, like I don't want to hear about the existence of a game through that app. You know, I'd rather hear like a rush of news in a Nintendo Direct or something, but maybe that's just me not wanting 'cause the rest of the time that app is like you know, here's a 3D model of Gucci and I just don't want that. So Yeah, but but like that's I mean that's a minor thing, you know, that's just you know I think the message is fine, it's just uh the you know the message m method is leaves a little to be desired.

Samuel
26:19
So there's a Nintendo Music app. There's the Nintendo Today app. There's the Nintendo, is there a store app as well?

Matthew
26:26
Yeah.

Samuel
26:26
A separate store app. And then is that does Alamo have its own app as well, Matthew?

Speaker 3
26:30
I don't think Alamo has an app. And I certainly don't have an Alamo app.

Samuel
26:34
Okay, yeah, I haven't asked you how you're getting on with your Alarmo actually. That's uh maybe that should be best say for a Patreon episode um so people can discover that that uh uh exciting information behind the paywall Yeah, so um a lot of apps and uh you know I do think some of the things that they're doing up is pretty cool. I feel like they've given a lease of life to some games that Either I thought everyone had bought on console or that maybe didn't do as well on console as they should have done. So um Star Wars Outlaws, for example, had a has had a big old push from Nintendo because I think they're quite proud that this game is very well optimized um for for the platform and you know it is a is a game that notoriously did not sell as well as Ubisoft wanted it to and I quite like the idea of things getting a second go around on switch to and maybe that becomes its profile a little bit. That um, you know, sort of uh different things can succeed there because they're connecting with different kinds of audiences than they previously found on. um PlayStation and Xbox or PC, which I think is is definitely true for Nintendo platforms. It is its own particular audience. And so it's cool to go into that bestsellers chart and see some slightly unusual things selling. I do agree it'd be nice for more indie developers to have that dev kit, like um, you know, there's a couple of games in my list where you're like, that should be on Switch too, but I just don't think that the um You know, either the developers haven't been able to get it out yet or those dev kits are not available, whatever it might be. Um, that's definitely something. Um I agree with you about the cadence of games and more generally, I think it's pretty a pretty solid output I think like you say there's no ten out of ten stunner stunners exactly.

Speaker 3
28:03
But um But there's also n nothing less than a seven.

Samuel
28:06
Yeah, it's a real s well uh well it dep I'll challenge you on that perhaps when we get into the list, Matthew. Um But uh there's certainly, you know, like it feels that every two months or every month even this, um and it's been I think it's like probably four games already that I'd quite like to own. I own two of them and I've asked for a a third one for my for Christmas um from my my parents. What have you asked for? How embarrassing is it?

Speaker 3
28:31
Uh it's not that embarrassing. It's um it's Kirby Air Riders I asked for that. So um we'll see if I get it. That's all right.

Matthew
28:37
Yeah. I can just I I mean there's like buying it online and not having to think about it and like Picking it up in the shop and thinking my 37-year-old son wants this pink ball. That's got that's got a a different energy to it.

Samuel
28:50
Yeah, I guess so, but You know, I just try and reassure my parents. Maybe I'll like send them a link to my LinkedIn page and be like, I I do have a career as well, you know, it's not like just the pink ball. There's like other stuff going on. You know, I've had I've had I've had multiple girlfriends, you know, like help me out help me out here. I'm doing okay, you know? The pink ball is simply one of my um one of the things that I have just going on on the side. Uh you know, so yeah, like um I think they're doing I think they're doing alright. I do wish that battery life was better on the Switch too. It's my main caveat with the console But I have no problems with the screen, I have no problems with the hardware. I like that they improved the store a little bit to get some of that garbage out of the um the different sale pages. I feel like you see less of that than ever, that's good. And I agree with you that the selection of GameCube games Really solid start on that, and I look forward to seeing where that's going. And it's just cool to have people excited about hardware again, even if it's sort of low-key excitement. That's good, isn't it? A bit less of the old um cynicism. And if it did feel like people were just ready to meet the Switch 2 with a bit of cynicism. And I'm glad it's not been the uh I'm glad it's not been the case because Yeah. I like seeing Nintendo do well, you know? Um so yes. As do I. Indeed, Matthew. So which types of games popped off this year? And was it a weaker year for any particular area of games?

Matthew
30:01
Uh I feel like like we're fully in the the roguelike-like era. That is games which are like other roguelikes. So like Bellatro-likes, Vampire Survivor-likes, Hades-likes. I feel like there's Every other game seems to be, here's a loop, start from scratch, collect some stuff, see what happens, play for half an hour, maybe the score goes crazy at the end, maybe it doesn't. back to the beginning, uh you know, and and and no sign of stopping. I've seen people talk about, you know, their most played game this year just being like demos of games like this for next year. And we're just yeah, we're just so so in that place and it's weird because I kind of I've made a bit of a sort of conscious decision like not to not to really engage with that stuff as much anymore. Like I've I almost feel like not that it's wasted time, but I I you know I I don't like being dragged into these endless loops. Like I'm I'm attracted to things which are a a bit more finite and the idea of having something I'm gonna play for a thousand hours. doesn't particularly speak to me and you know I played a demo of that one with the the there's the upcoming one with the coins, the raccoon coin machine. Oh yeah, yeah. I think that might have been like the sort of uh sort of broke the camera's back, you know? In terms of these machines were like Absolutely mindless soft penny munching time wasting things when I was a kid. Do I really want a digital version of it which doesn't rely on real money so it can kind of keep me ensnared forever. Do I want to feed virtual two pence pieces into my PC? uh for 500 hours in 2026. You know, and I could see just from the demo like how artfully conceived it all was to drag you into one more go and I I I think at some point y you know well you don't have to put your foot down, but maybe I am putting my foot down and going, nah, I just don't think that's for me anymore. So that's that's that's been a bit of a bummer because I know there's loads of great stuff happening in that space, but I so just I just d wanna I just wanna out really.

Samuel
32:15
Yeah. I see also that game Clover Pit that came out this year that was like v like um the slot machine, uh but like you know, like sort of a casino in hell basically and It's sort it did take off. It's sort of like one of those meme games you buy it for like five or six quid and then maybe you play about it and talk about it and it sold like a million copies straight away.

Matthew
32:38
Like oh here's this thing that people lose themselves to it for real in real life and ha ha ha let's do it here. I don't know. I'm like

Speaker 3
32:48
Yeah. It's beginning to g I'm getting the ick about it, I think. Yeah, I don't I don't really have that so much, but I do my worry with the roguelike structure is that games length g the length of games is being artificially inflated by the roguelike structure.

Samuel
33:02
And that's where my disillusionment with those kinds of games is really stepping in, where I'm like, this could have been ten hours shorter, or this could have been five hours shorter, but you wanted this to loop. You wanted me to wait until a thing happened that was really beneficial for me to to push through. And in my head I'm like, I I almost wish you could deliver all these same ideas in just one 10 hour stretch, you know, or whatever it might be. Or maybe it's the the same each time and it's more predictable or or just something like a different solution to that because It does, it can feel like wasted time, and it's exactly why I didn't play Clover Pit because it looked like wasted time to me. I just thought, well, the best thing that happens is I play this for like seven or eight hours and I go, oh, that was so Moorish, and then it gets an honorable mention on this podcast. But I think when push comes to shove, I would rather chuck that time at something that does have a beginning, middle, and end, you know

Matthew
33:55
And so Yeah, I think I think that's that's very much where I am and I don't wanna play things where like victory j only becomes inevitable through time Yeah. That does not speak to me anymore. Uh yeah, it just it's just a switch has gone off in my head where I'm like, nope. So if I even get a whiff of it, I'm like out. Oh that's interesting.

Samuel
34:15
The irony is one of the games that led me to a similar place is in my top ten. Um it it truly like um pushing that to its limit. But yeah, it's um even though it's some amazing games have come out of that space Uh like even going back to something like FTL a game I genuinely love, that the difficulty was such a kick in the shins each time you played it, it was like It does it just became time wasting at a certain point. And I think I even feel that way about Into the Breach these days, where I fire it up and I'm like, well this is just like time down the sink, really. It's sort of like until I get the right conditions to to finish it. And it's it's a bit bleak to feel that way about a whole subsection of games. That said, I will play Recoin, Matthew. I am kinda Yeah, yeah.

Matthew
34:57
Yeah, I mean it's I mean I've already seen like some people announce that that is Game of the Year 2026 and I can see that happening. I can see that being a thing. Like PlayStack have just got a great eye for, you know, w you know what people are gonna like and and you know what the next big thing's gonna be. But um I just think for my own sanity, I'm like, oh, I just don't know if I can.

Samuel
35:20
Yeah, I I do get you. Um it's sort of it's gonna need to be something special, I think, for me too. to play a roguelike at this point. In fact I'm already kind of dreading like Mine of the Hollower, a game that's got phenomenal pixel art that we played that demo of, and that just seemed to be like the old Dark Souls thing of Ah, we just want you to play it over and over again. That is a beginning, middle, and an end thing, but it is also still like Ev so much of it is about time taken from you now as opposed to what happens in that time. It's about how can we just keep you engaged for longer? And I don't want to be in it for longer. I want to get my arms around what all those ideas are and then kind of like bounce basically. And so I don't really I would think I'd rather play the fifteen hour version of Mid of the Hollower over a potential like twenty-five hour version, you know? Right. So that's just sort of how I'm I'm left feeling about about some of these some of these things these days. Um you're right, that they are different things, but it's sort of like I'm conscious of the time that games take. And if I feel like it it's being wasted now, um I may just bounce even if I've I've only got two chapters of Matthew the old country left to finish, Matthew. So that's just that's just the way it might be. Maybe I just want the time back to put into something else. Um perhaps that is also a getting old thing though. And um the roguelike thing may also be a a similar deal. I actually think that it is struggle uh you you would struggle to pick any connective tissue between the really key games from this year more generally. I think that it is a bit more unexpected what the genres might be. And I think that what the indie games that succeeded this year have in common with previous years is that I think a lot of the most talked about ones are all doing something you either haven't seen before, or is a fresh spin on something you have seen before, but not in a while, maybe, and presented in a way that really captures people's imaginations. Like the really unique Indies are still the ones that jump out. I don't think another game that's in the Hades mold will ever break out again in the same way 'cause people will be like, Well, I've played I've played this before and there are games that have ripped off Hades and I just don't think they really um they really jump up the sales charts or really stand out in a any particular way. I think it still takes something uh fresh, something you've never quite seen before. Uh a configuration of things you've never quite seen before to really stand out. I don't know if you felt that way too.

Matthew
37:37
Yeah, I mean I think that's even true for Hades too. You know, I I know some people have gone all in on it, but there is a sense of Yes, it's this excellent thing, but like wow, this was so fresh once. And now it is not, it's an expanded bag of tricks, uh, but it's the same bag of tricks and That's a that's a little bit of a bummer, but you know, hopefully they'll come up with something, you know, properly fresh next.

Speaker 3
38:03
Indeed. Uh so how was your year on a personal level, Matthew? Uh I'd say pretty boring, uh, but in a welcome way.

Matthew
38:10
Turned forty this year, didn't have a lot of drama with that. Tried to get a little bit healthier maybe as a result after some uh yeah, concerning tellings off from the doctor. The most exciting thing that happened to me this year is uh I got over my fear of fancy dress at work and at a Halloween party, dressed up as Danny from the Shining. Which you know was a bit of a mental hurdle for me because I don't really like that kind of stuff. Uh and then instantly regretted it because everyone thought I was marrying.

Speaker 3
38:40
So um So good. Uh if only had Catherine there dressed as Luigi. That's uh that's something that happened to me.

Matthew
38:47
It turns out uh uh uh a larger man can't put on b blue dungrees and a red top. Um even though there was no hat and no M and Mario doesn't wear Converses. I knew I should have bought the fucking trike. If I bought the trike, ever would have been like Kid from the Shining. Amazing.

Speaker 3
39:05
Like Mario When has he ever been on a trite? Well, people might think think it's Mario Kart though, that's the problem. They're like, Oh, couldn't you afford a cart, Mario? I'm like, No, I'm Danny on his famous iconic tripe Someone just goes du and then you just have to start pedaling really fast out of the bar. Um that could have happened, Matthew. But uh yeah, that's That is funny. But the joke was on them because I won best costume at that party. If you stood further away, they might have thought you were Danny from the Shining. You'd been like, oh look at that, that distant man over there.

Matthew
39:36
I think that's I'm just so enormous that I Just it's very, very hard to picture me as like an a tiny eight-year-old boy. Like I r and the dungarees just make me look like I am in uh a Mario or more like some farmer character. If someone was like Oh, are you like Jonathan Kent?

Speaker 3
39:54
I'd be like, you know, that would be more of a believable. Which one? Which Jonathan Kent?

Matthew
40:00
Like the one from the most like

Speaker 3
40:05
Yeah, I c okay, I c I could see how you might approximate that.

Matthew
40:08
Like a larger man with a belly.

Speaker 3
40:10
Yeah, I mean in in Dongarees I just I had more sort of like redneck energy than I did anything else.

Samuel
40:17
Well I think you have a I just watched Deliverance the other day on that note. Um you don't want to really go with cosplay as one of those lads so that's a bit too cursed I think. Um but yeah, so I I do think that y you know, relatively speaking, you are sort of like if Danny from the Shining is Squirtle, you are Blastoise. Like you are just like you know, you're You're unmistakably not the same thing anymore, you are just bigger. Um so I'm sorry that happened to you, but I think maybe next year you just dress for your your size a little bit more. Like goes wreck it rough or something, you know? Just sort of like where people might just be like, Oh yeah, I know who that is. Um But I'm glad to hear about the Helster. Sorry, Wreck It Ralph is probably like less flattering than Parquet was fine. We were we were doing okay there. Um let's go with that. You just gotta start crash dieting like I do Get fat over the course of four weeks. Have two weeks where you you um you have uh like do the five two diet, and then it's gone again, and then you just begin the cycle again, eating loads of bullshit over the course of a month. It's not recommended by doctors necessarily, but It's working out for me, Matthew. So two giant men go on a crash diet. That's coming next year on the XL tier, so look forward to that. Um we'll be tracking Matthew's nutrition day by day. It'll be uh be a good time.

Speaker 3
41:28
Um, so yes, that was Matthew's year. That was it. That's all I did in the whole year was dress up for one evening as Danny from the Shining.

Matthew
41:36
You did some other stuff. You go to the theatre a lot. I mean it's not particularly uh Juicy stuff for for podcast chat. I saw loads of films which you heard about in our film podcasts.

Speaker 3
41:45
I went to the theatre lots in London. Saw stereophonic. We talked about that on the po on the podcast.

Matthew
41:50
Yeah, that was fun. That was fun. Um I actually I'll tell you something that was a like a little a little bit sad. I did the I did the least amount of games writing I've done in the last twenty years this year. Right. There's just less work going about for it, you know, and you do sense it. And because I'm not a full-time freelancer. I can't really begrudge not being like someone's go-to guy, you know, when there are people who like it is just the thing that they do full time. But yeah, I think I reviewed like one game? Two games tops? Hmm. Damn. Which is yeah, I mean that's that's that's crazy. So yeah, that was that. But then I got to go to the Switch 2 event and that was nice. That felt like Proper good old fashioned like being back on Endgamer, just you know, I've got four hours to play a load of games and fill my head with opinions and Yeah, I like that.

Samuel
42:39
And what a great podcast we got out of that as well. And the um the Switch 2 launch. I feel like we got both amazing pods out of both those things this year. Yeah, it was fun.

Speaker 3
42:47
Yeah, it was a good year for the podcast as well, I feel like. We Oh yeah, absolutely oh yeah, I should say, like that's you know, that's what makes it okay.

Matthew
42:55
Like we should I I d I definitely have an outlet, it's fine.

Samuel
42:59
Yeah, I mean we crossed uh nine hundred paying subscribers on Patreon this year, which was very flattering. We've uh done a few bits and pieces behind the scenes to make it a bit easier to listen to the podcast and the platform of your choice, so If you subscribe to the Patreon you can very easily listen to um the Excel episodes on Spotify now as well. And I think that's led to a bit of a spike in people um signing up, which is uh obviously really flattering, uh 'cause the more money uh that kind of goes into the podcast the more we sort of reinvest it back in the podcast. Like you know, we put a lot of time into it, so we're very grateful um for all the support we get, especially because we know it's uh challenging out there in terms of cost of living. So we um we are really really grateful and we take it really seriously. And uh yeah, it's been um it's been good on that front for sure. How has your personal year been? Ugh It was alright. I started and ended the year with the same job, um, but had a different job in between. Um so that happened this year. That made it. seem maybe more dramatic than uh it actually was. I'm actually I'm ri I'm I've touched wood, I'm absolutely cursing myself saying this. I'm just craving a more straightforward 2026. I would quite like a consistent year. Um but you know, that we'll we'll see how that goes. But yeah, I don't know. I started the year working um in PR at Bethesda, as I'm sure listeners of the podcast know. I am Basically, like I'm technically a contractor, I work for a PR agency and do their kind of UK PR. I also do their Nordics PR now. So bas um dealing with journalists I've never dealt with before. Um having to translate uh Finnish, which is um a hell of a thing. Um there are some turns of phrase in Finnish that are just like so confusing. I'm like, this is basically like the mythology of of an RPG game. Like it's I'm j I'm genuinely baffled by uh some of their sort of like comparis the comparisons that are made, like their normal things, and I'll be like Should you be comparing this film to a fish? But like it turns out that but then I'll Google it and it'll be it will be and it turns out it is a real phrase and I'm like I wish I could get the example I I mean, but it was something about it was like the number one headline on s on this game's website when I went on there. Was something like Um thi this film is like a uh a herring in pickles or something like that. It was that that kind of phrase where that I thought that's gotta be a translation error, but then I looked it up and it this specific fish uh sort of like phrase was a real thing. And I was like, okay, well they're you know each country just ha is completely different from the other

Speaker 3
45:23
And so um kind of like their equivalent of like top banana or something. Yeah, exactly.

Samuel
45:28
Or just I mean we've got loads of phrases like that in Britain that if someone said I'm in a right two and eight and you gave that to someone from Finland, they'd be like, What the fuck are you talking about? And it's like well You know, Cockley rhyming slang is sort of its own uh kind of like comedy mythology, really. So it's you know, it's um it's tough. But So yeah, I um I do that and um it's probably also quite obvious to listen that I very much enjoyed doing that. I enjoy working on Indiana Jones uh last year. I worked a little bit on Doom the Dark Ages this year, a l a a very tiny bit I worked on um the Oblivion remaster that came out this year as well. And some Fallout stuff and Elder Squirrel stuff. Um so I uh I'm you know it's it's it's it feels like the right thing um I should be doing. I briefly worked on gamesindistry. biz this year as well and uh I hired um Lewis Packwood there, um the features editor, who is um definitely one of the best hires I've ever made. Um he's amazing. uh sort of gain for that website. And um yes, uh so I did enjoy working there as well. Um You met the Benz? Met Leslie Benzes, yeah, that did happen before the all the tears began for Mind's Eye. Um we sort of knew it was uh it was gonna happen but um You know, that was uh an interesting thing that happened this year. And um yeah, it was did a uh stage uh sort of talk with Jay Bayliss, Matt Handrahan who came with us podcast this year. And uh that was fun and uh develop, that was cool. And yeah, but then went back to PR, um where I I feel like it's a bit different to games journalism and maybe what more um more I'm in the headspace of, but to be honest it was just a case of I was at a job I really liked and I got the chance to go back. It was definitely no um no commentary on um the GI job, which was um which was a great opportunity as well. So yeah, that's what I'm doing these days. um to sort of like do a bit of PR on my own LinkedIn page um and CV, which is always fun, isn't it? Um but yes, I am craving um touch wood, a very quiet 2026. So we'll see how that goes, Matthew Um because I'm trying to buy a house at the moment, and that's a whole fucking saga. So um yes. Um and apart from that, nothing happens to me. And so now we move on. Um so Before we get into our top ten list, Matthew, is there anything you wish we got to this year that we didn't have time for in 2025? So as in specific games. Yeah, or just like even stuff related to the podcast, like things you wanted to do, or or anything like that really.

Matthew
47:44
Uh well, as we all know, I have no ideas for the podcast, so no on that front. I'll just go along with it. I've played about an hour and a half of Kirby Air Riders, which was enough to go, oh, this seems really fun, but I Probably need to have a proper sit-down with this and get my head around it 'cause it is a little bit odd. Looks absolutely amazing. Some very, very shiny graphics going on um when I can tear my eyes away from the you know the madness that's kind of unfolding on screen. A team I really wish I'd played, the Altars.

Speaker 3
48:18
Oh yeah, I thought that as well, 'cause it popped up in a bunch of the Game of the Year lists, didn't it?

Matthew
48:21
Yeah. And it it just it just sort of passed me by and um Came highly praised by Abbey Stone when I met up with them for for a drink a few weeks ago and the idea of it intrigued me and the idea of all these like weirdo sort of um alternate path s selves meeting and working together. Um also the one the one that I I'm sort of toying with trying to play over the holidays um as I have, you know, a chunk of time. I actually really want to give um Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines two ago. Oh right, yeah. Marsh Davies was singing its praises, saying that it it actually had pretty good story and shape to it. I just feel like the conversation's been dominated by what it's not comparing it to the original game, which I don't have any great affinity for, I must admit. But to hear him say this is legit for these reasons made me think, ignore everything else they've heard. It's one of those recommendations you get where you think, I kind of Need to listen to this person.

Samuel
49:28
So Yeah, that's uh that's a good shout. Uh I had a few of a few things like this, this year, Matthew, so I did intend to to finish Death Stranding and therefore play Death Stranding 2. Um but I just it dawned on me that just wasn't going to be enough time to do that. So um yeah that is a bit of a another ongoing project for me um to try and solve. I was quite excited. I'm quite excited to dig into the Final Fantasy Tactics uh remaster they did this year, um, because that seemed to be a very celebrated version of a game that I know is like totally beloved by a subset of that audience. So that is something I would definitely like to get to. Um there aren't like that many other games though from this year where I'm like dying to get to it. I've already started some of the ones that I want to I want to finish, so I will do Ghost of Yote, I will do um the Outer Worlds 2. And uh yeah, it's uh there's there's been no shortage of games in that sort of 8 out of 10 um kind of bracket. I do want to go back to that Metal Gear Solid um Delta Remaster at some point because that was a really tasty looking thing. Um, I will finish at least one of my Silent Hill F playthroughs as well. Um that just it seems like uh work because of the combat in that game. But um Nonetheless, uh I will get to that. Um yeah, podcast wise, I sort of like had some ambitions to do a Half-Life episode this year. I finished Half-Life 1 and 2 for the first time, and uh I got most of the way through Half-Life uh opposing force and I did blue shift and um I've got the episodes to do still for regular Half-Life but If you believe the rumour mill, there is a Half-Life game coming next year. Um and so if it if that lands then, that might be the time to do an episode on that series, Matthew. So um yeah, but otherwise did everything I wanted to. We played so many old games for the podcast this year, from you know The GTAs, the Mario Galaxy games, Metro Prime, um, you know, even like more recent games like we did the Indiana Jones episode, for example, that was Really good and I've I've really enjoyed doing those two giant men play episodes are the ones I look forward to the most now when we do them. Um aside from the draft. So um Yeah, I uh absolutely fucking monstrously long list of games I did finish this year, just not all of them were from this year. So that was uh that's what came to mind. And finally, Matthew, before we take a quick break and come back with our top 10 lists, can you remember which games you called the best of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 and 2024 on this podcast?

Matthew
51:46
I asked you this last year. I think I can.

Speaker 3
51:48
Yeah, okay, go for it.

Matthew
51:50
2020.

Speaker 3
51:52
Desperados three. Correct. 2021. Is that Metroid Dread year? It is the Metroid Dread year, yes. Then Metroid Dread.

Samuel
52:02
Uh I'm waiting for Graham's fan site to fucking open. It's taking its time. Um yes, that was Metroid Dread, Matthew.

Speaker 3
52:08
Well done. Um very good. 2022. That's too early for Tears of the Kingdom.

Matthew
52:13
That is the fuck happened that year.

Speaker 3
52:16
It's something weird. We talked about it relatively recently, this game.

Samuel
52:20
We talked about I don't want to give you too many clues here, but we talked about one like vampire survivors. No, it wasn't. That was number three on your list though. Yeah, it got to number four on my list as well.

Speaker 3
52:31
Um is this uh is this a Xenoblade year? It was, yes. Uh well done. Xenoblade three. Yep, very good. Now 2023. That's gotta be Tears of the Kingdom. Yes, that was Tears of the Kingdom.

Matthew
52:42
And finally last year. This is either Ballateral or Infinite Wealth.

Samuel
52:50
Uh you went with infinite wealth and Infinite Wealth. You actually had Indiana Jones at two and Bellatra at two.

Matthew
52:56
Yeah, I remembered it wasn't Indiana Jones because I hadn't finished it, so I didn't know exactly I I didn't want to like properly anoint it without having played it all the way through. Yeah, okay, fair enough. When I do this.

Speaker 3
53:08
That was like Indiana Jones got to number two just from the Vatican.

Samuel
53:13
Yeah, it's a tough game to squeeze into the very end of the just 'cause I think you had something like about nine days between the release of the game and the podcast. So I mean I'm seeing it I'm seeing it pop up in a bunch of game of the year lists this year. So I think um people are sort of Come to it later, maybe when it would land on PS5 or whatever. But when we do this next year, we should swap. So I've got to guess what your ones were. You have to guess what my ones were.

Matthew
53:35
Oh yeah, I should have

Samuel
53:35
prepped this and asked you but I haven't prepped it. That's alright. I think I remember mine off the top of my head. I think Apex was my 2020. I think my actually no I've forgotten my 2021. Oh wait no that was tunic 2021. 2022 Can't remember. 23 is definitely Jedi Survivor. 24 was Dragon's Dogma 2. Um 2022 then I'll find out what that was. Yeah, I'll really hope that's not coming to mind, but I'm sure when I see it, I'll be like, oh yeah, it was that fucking game. And it was. . Oh no, that was Tunic 2022. So what was 2021? What a mystery. Is this where a fucking Norco is my number one? A hitman 3. There you go. That makes sense. Hitman three. Okay. Norco. Well I like Norco, but Yeah, we were big Norco heads. Yeah, um it's me, Norco.

Speaker 3
54:16
I don't know if that developer's made anything else or y in the meantime, but um Pro just still dining out on all the that Norco green Which is uh substantial.

Samuel
54:26
Okay Matthew, let's take a quick break then and come back with our two top ten lists of the best games of 2025 Welcome back to the podcast. So yes, as ever, two top ten lists, whoever get whoever whoever fuck's sake. Whoever has a game has a g game high struggle to describe but I didn't even start this time. I was on the first word and it went wrong. Okay, so if a game appears higher on one person's list, we'll talk about it when we get to that position in the list. So we'll go one the other person will go higher on my list, and then we'll uh we'll wait to reach that point in the list before talking about it. There's a more concise way of discussing that. If you're a longtime listener of the podcast, you know what I'm talking about, and you've heard me butcher that literally hundreds of times at this point. So um alas. Okay Matthew, before we get started, what's your most disappointing game of the year? I always ask for one thing that just didn't quite set your your engine going. Um just to sort of like, you know, get a little bit of a a taste of how your year went on the on the sort of more disappointing end I guess. Yeah.

Speaker 3
55:40
So I've got to limit it to one. Well you can ma maybe like do one and then some like honourable mentions. It's it's probably got to be Metroid Prime four. Ah yeah.

Matthew
55:49
Yeah. I say that I wasn't expecting like some great ten out of ten. I almost feel like it's it's lucky that this game ever came out just because, you know, it had such a turbulent time making it to release but it's it's like merely fine in every way. I don't think there's anything like bad about it. I think there's some stuff which is great about it in fact. Like there's it the way it looks. I think the controls, like I love the the pointer controls, the motion controls. particularly, you know, they were great on Prime One remastered, but yeah here like buttery smooth, so good. I I just felt it it It felt a little bit too streamlined and frictionless, and every level just feels like a massive tube coming out of quite a boring desert and I enjoyed my journeys through those tubes, but the toing and froing, the art of backtracking, which I think is key to Metroid and masterfully done in Metroid Prime 1 is uh really lacking here. You go into the levels once and then you go into the levels at the end of the game when you've got all the powers to sort of strip them of a few leftover power-ups and that's really how it works.

Speaker 3
57:03
It st didn't feel very elegant to me. Yeah, it's funny because I have only played the first five or so hours of that game.

Samuel
57:11
But even though I would I thought some of the boss battles are pretty cool, um, it just I just felt like my heart rate was so low while I was playing it. It just never It just never excited me, it never really intrigued me. It it never really created a sense of mystery about the place. Um or just really I I managed I just sort of quietly dropped it without even consciously doing so. I just sort of forgot about it. Which is sort of like the most damning thing you can say about a game really. Um yeah, I didn't have loads of riding on it. I mean I came to Metro Prime properly this year when we did that episode, but Uh yeah, I sort of um it would have been nice for it to have surprised, you know, in the way that Dredd did. Um, but uh yeah, didn't happen. So that's tough. Um yeah, okay. Um so I've put Mario Kart World for this. Um this not a bad game by any means it is good Mario Kart. But it just doesn't um

Speaker 3
58:06
I guess there's just maybe nowhere left to go with Mario Kart. Apart from everywhere. That's what Mario Kart Worlds promises.

Samuel
58:13
Yeah, and you know, it is I I did think there was a a cool kind of novelty to the continuous nature of the tracks, but I guess not so much that it really captured my imagination. It still feels like the same game despite that. And I did like the sort of It it was cool that slightly trippy journey from one space to another and just seeing the the the world change around you as these you know, they have to find a way to make all of these different, you know, types of geography kind of coexist basically. That's cool. And I did really like the knockout mode they added to it as well. That was cool. But I guess I just felt like I've played too much Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in my life for this to feel like something I truly need. And that's despite this game having an absolutely phenomenal two thousand one of Space Odyssey ass take on Rainbow Road, um, which really delivers. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. And if it's your first or like You know, you have first Mario Kart experience or you haven't played a Mario Kart game in a while. I think this game probably um will delight you more, but just inevitably felt a little bit too familiar. Is that too harsh, Matthew?

Matthew
59:21
I've heard this said a lot about it, so uh you know there is there is obviously some truth to it. I'm happy after Mario Kart 8, which felt like basically the perfected version of that kind of Mario Kart. Uh, I think they were right to, you know, try and challenge some of the conventions and do do something different with it. Whether or not that entirely works for people. Obviously we hear from a lot of people who it hasn't, but this game's been phenomenally successful. I think it's interesting that they're still kind of tinkering with it not as full on as like a constant live service game, but you know, the fact that they're, you know, rerouting some of the tracks and you know, trying to sort of draw out more fun from it. I think that's that it that shows an interesting ongoing conversation with it. I r I really like it. I it ha i I will say it hasn't made my top ten.

Samuel
01:00:14
Yeah.

Speaker 3
01:00:14
That's what I mean is disappointment is almost not fair. It's almost like It could have b it could have been one of the games, but it just Yeah That's like an expectation thing.

Matthew
01:00:24
Where you know Nintendo have have this habit of reimagining something, you know, or they they've come out of this run of basically making like the very best versions of loads of their long-running series. So the idea of like a Mario Kart that is, you know, to Mario Kart what Z uh Breath of the Wild is to Zelda, and it isn't that, you know, it's like a big swing, but also one that doesn't quite work. and doesn't quite deliver on it. I just I uh yeah, I just see some people are like, oh it's a load of shit. It's just a load of shit, this big open world that they've made and I think I I I think that is so wrong. But uh not enough that I would You know, I'm not gonna pretend it's a ten or anything.

Samuel
01:01:07
Yeah, it's sort of uh disappointment, I mean uh you know, it it's sort of maybe that word is too strong. It's more like the potential in my head versus the reality. This game is not mine's eye, for example, which is probably probably deserves it more.

Speaker 3
01:01:20
I did play that for an hour and a half. And it's better than that Sonic Racing game this year. Definitely better than that, yes. So um

Samuel
01:01:25
Yeah, but I think it's just I thought that when that came along, I was like, oh asso, that is a sure thing in my top ten. And it just um it just isn't in there either. So um yes, but uh Good to sort of like set the tone a bit. I think people were waiting for us to maybe have the Metro Prime 4 conversation, Matthew, but yeah, it's true.

Matthew
01:01:43
Yeah, I mean we we we're gonna do a uh uh what we've been playing in the new year quite early on where we round up some stuff that we haven't talked about and I think that would be a good place to really get into Metro Prime 4.

Samuel
01:01:53
Yeah considering the jokes we made about open world being you know sort of like empty or filled with stuff and it's sort of like it is like the the green crystals and some quite nice uh sort of land land masses but not loads else so um Yeah, there is more to say there, but I don't even know if I'll finish it to be honest. So um yeah.

Matthew
01:02:12
Oh it's worth it's worth seeing through to the end, I think.

Samuel
01:02:15
Well yeah, okay. I'll give that s I'll give that some thought. But um it's certainly I will say this for it. It is a nice looking game. And on that Metroid episode we did, I sounded a little bit lukewarm on how it looked. So they I think it was more that it was made for the Switch, therefore how nice can it look? I think was my more my response to it. But It is it is actually a beautiful looking game. It looks nicer than um Metro Prime remastered for sure. And they've still got it when it comes to Wild Direction. It's um it's just uh the actual game design part of it that's um patchy and inconsistent across the game. So okay Matthew, let's get into my top tens then.

Speaker 3
01:02:52
So do you want to kick off with on your number 10? I'm gonna kick off with my number 10 This I think is the only game I haven't talked about on the podcast. Ooh, intriguing.

Samuel
01:03:01
Yes, it's gonna be a bit more predictable than normal, I think, basic but because of that, you know?

Matthew
01:03:05
Yeah. Uh from my number 10 I am picking a free bat browser game called Clues by Sam. Oh, okay.

Speaker 3
01:03:15
Here he goes. Here's a little dose of bullshit to kick things off. The mini-shoot adventures of 2025 is.

Matthew
01:03:21
Yeah, so I've been I've been like dabbling with what I would describe as daily time wasters for years and years, you know, like trying to find a game which it sort of holds your attention like Wordle. I did a bit of the New York Times mini crossword, Vulture Cinematrix. None of them have ever managed to enter my my routine kind of consistently. None of them have quite got the juice for me, but this is a game very much in that mold. Um it's called Clues by Sam. It's free to play. Um if you just search for Clues by Sam, uh you can find it on on Google and I play it on my mobile every day. The way it works is uh you have a grid of 20 characters on a 4x5 grid And the game is to work out who on the grid is innocent and who on the grid is a criminal. Each person on that grid has a little statement written under their name, though to begin with you only get one statement. And uh they they give you a they give you a fact, they give you a truth about about the grid and how it's behaving. So they might say, so and so on row one is one of the criminals. or I'm neighbouring three innocent people and then the game is basically using those statements it gives you to logically deduce who is innocent and who is criminal. When you get a correct answer, it gives you another statement which helps inform further thinking. Interestingly, you can't just spam it. You know, if you if you try and guess and the game's creator deems you currently don't have the information to know that for sure, it will let you guess, but it'll it'll say like actually you don't have the information to prove that. When So, you know, let's put that on hold for now. Maybe it is the you know, there's a hint of crime to it in the fact that they call them criminals that kind of caught my imagination to begin with. Like I wouldn't say this is a detective game. Like it's that's just how they've skinned it But I uh I f I find it really compelling. I do it when I'm eating my lunch at work on my phone. It has a range of difficulties, so every day you go in and it'll be like today's is easy, today's is tricky, today's is a nightmare. um and they take a different amount of time. But it's nice to have a a little something like this when you're munching on a sandwich or doing something a bit mindless to kind of give you a bit of focus. And I'm always very jealous of Catherine, she does the full suite of New York Times mini games it seems and like none of them quite do it for me. But um Yeah, this one I really like, Clues by Sam.

Samuel
01:05:55
Yeah, it does look like Guess Who via the New York Times games uh sort of. Um but you know, I I I could see why I think it's cool to highlight something like this. Um I do think I would be bad at this, but maybe I should play it and um No, I think you'd be alright, like.

Matthew
01:06:12
I tell you what, it's it's like the It's like the big brother of the um the three box statements in blueprints. Oh right, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here's some clues giving you vague information. Can you combine you know, the the vagueness into like one solid truth elsewhere and yeah, it's just nice. I like that you have a little journey through it. Sometimes There are like little jokes hidden in there. Like sometimes people will just say like a little thing instead of having a clue and sometimes like the way he's named the characters or the professions, it feels like he's like you know, nodding to, you know, films or games or other mysteries.

Speaker 3
01:06:51
So it's very like characterful, very charming. I do wonder if the presence of um Comic Sand has put you off at all, Matthew, because

Samuel
01:06:59
It is so like pared down looking that it's almost like kind of uh it's just kind of funny to look at and here the here the game is just thing is like it doesn't matter because the mechanics are clearly like all the game is. So it doesn't matter how it looks but Um it is the thing that jumps out when you Google it is just. That is a lot of comic sans on that grid. Um so that is true.

Matthew
01:07:21
Um no I I know it's powerful enough to get me to overlook that.

Samuel
01:07:25
Yeah, that's cool. I'll um I'll give this a go and um I'll talk about it in that f in that episode we do early next year of Games We Missed. Um exactly the sort of thing I would play on my phone. over Christmas, really get into, then get my dad into. And then my and my dad my dad in his uh in his undiagnosed fashion would just play that all year and then tell me like eight months in I've played this every single day for like the entire year. And I'd be like, okay, cool.

Matthew
01:07:50
Yeah, 'cause you really can only play it one you know, one grid a day and you can't go back into the archive as far as I can tell, so it it really limits like how much you can engage with it.

Samuel
01:08:01
Yeah, okay. That's uh that's a a bit unexpected for the uh for the end of year list and I do know like that you always like to bring a surprise to the table. I think I've talked about everything else on this list Hey, it looks like uh that guy Northern Lion got behind this um uh in a big way. Uh so yeah, definitely keen to give this a go. Do not let my um my response to it in my superficial response to it um sound uh dubious because it does look like a cool game.

Speaker 3
01:08:26
You engage engaged with this more than I thought you were going to

Matthew
01:08:28
Yeah, it looks like. That's quite a promise.

Samuel
01:08:31
Yeah, like do you know the the last game I got my dad hooked on was a little game called Bellatroy Matthew. So um he's still playing it twelve months later And uh I wanted to think of another uh Bellatro like to get in play. Do you think he's gonna be a big recoin guy in twenty twenty six? I don't think so. No one gave me more grief for like putting two pence coins in those machines and Skegnes than my dad. So um I think he'll be out on Rakoin, unfortunately. But uh yeah, we'll see. Um see if it he'll give that a go. My number ten is a game I have talked about in the podcast before. Number ten is is is always a tricky one I think. You kinda set your stall out a little bit. And so um it's also though where you're not gonna put, you know, one of your absolute favourites of the year. So Bit tricky, but I eventually decided that after shuffling the number 10 position five times in the last week, that Shinobi out of vengeance is my number 10, Matthew. It's the best combat of any game I played this year, 2D or 3D. Had a wonderful rhythm to it. The depth of something like um bayonetta or dev my cry, um except in in 2D and um just perfect at layering on uh the sort of like the power curve of it so um it feels insurmountable some of the battles early in the game, but then um you just progress in terms of your your movement and your combos and your just perception of where enemies are on screen, how enemies behave, and you just slowly master it and the curve is just perfect. It In about 16 hours, um you'll be done, but you'll have um you'd have gotten so so good at this game. Um it is definitely not terrific as a platformer. That is the weakest part of the game for sure. Um but I did really love the maps in general. There's a a slight metro vania uh sort of like flavour, I guess, to the structure. Not in terms of it being one big map that you unpick, but it it being uh certain parts of the level that are gated um by you needing certain abilities so that you can just jump back into those levels. and um quite easily uh sort of like find the thing that you were missing or find the secret that you couldn't get to previously and um slowly accumulate um completion of the game as you go. And I really love that structure because it did feel like it had a little bit of the Metroidvania flavor without um without necessarily asking too much from you time-wise. Um had some uh some cool, slightly wacky uh chase sequences in between uh levels as well. Um I think there was one where a big battleship is firing at you and you're just um trying to avoid all these different shots while all these like these di these dudes come along on little jet skis and try and Fuck you up. Um that was cool. And the art style was really nice, sort of sh cell shaded, but um a little bit a little bit painterly. I guess a little bit sort of like anime-ish, a little bit manger-ish. And um some maps I just really love. Like the the Neo City map in this was my favorite. It's like four different directions you can go in in this metropolis that looks Very kind of Tokyo like, but Tokyo through a sort of Sega prism. You see, sort of like um I think it's I think various different bits of Sega hardware are referenced on uh billboards around this level and um yeah it's just so beautifully lit um with all these different um neon colours and yeah a really um really kind of fabulous to sort of traverse some of these um some of these maps. There's also a fish market level that I really liked as well, um, where it's just so it's like the most visually stylish take on quite a mundane location you could really um you could really imagine. And I just sank a uh bank holiday weekend into this when it came out and I've really had a great time with it. And Even though I think it is that the platforming element of it and the gliding sections I've mentioned before, including on the previous episode, is like a a definite flaw. I still think it's worth celebrating in spite of that flaw. So I couldn't I couldn't admit it from the top ten just because there's a couple of bits near the end that don't quite work because there's so much in it that does work. the real kind of like mastery of 2D combat that the developers uh lizard cube demonstrated here. And uh yes, that's why it's my number 10 Matthew. Any thoughts? Nice.

Matthew
01:12:29
Yeah, I remember this sort of happening in real time. You getting the code and being like, oh cheers for that, I might give that a go. to oh this is pretty good to oh man I c I can't stop playing this to you've done the whole thing in like a couple of days and that's that's like It's very rare v f you know, from my perspective anyway, to see you like completely lose yourself to something like this so quickly. So um yeah, I guess testament to that that power curve.

Samuel
01:12:58
Yeah, it really um it really just delivered and uh I've I yeah I um It's not like I'm a Shinobi guy, you know, it's not like I'm a there's a there's a top layer there's a top layer of Sega stuff that that I get and I celebrate. But there's Shinobi is in that sort of like second layer that I just don't really have any experience with and I know that many of our listeners will have experience with that. So I really just came into this completely fresh, but um I was yeah I was I was ready to be won over by it and um I think it is really cool. Um I know that the Switch version launched in a bit of a naff state, um so I guess I can't recommend that. I imagine on Steam Deck it's perfectly fine. But yeah, beautiful looking game, definitely deserves to be experienced on um hardware that can handle it. What's your number nine, Matthew?

Speaker 3
01:13:42
My number nine is Luminesur Eyes. Not on my list. Not on your list. Couldn't handle it, eh? Haha!

Samuel
01:13:52
Well, let's explain one fundamental difference of our Luminez Arise experience, Matthew. You played the journey mode on easy and I played the journey mode on normal So that is a really key differentiator here. That's on you.

Matthew
01:14:06
So yeah, Luminous Arise. I played it on PS5. It comes from Enhanced Games and Monstars Inc. uh which is the same pairing that did Tetris Effect a few years ago. And th this is a very similar deal in that it takes the classic block puzzler game Luminous uh and turns it into uh an all-singing, all dancing kind of audio and light show, very, very hectic visual star with like crazy trancey music. I I will say up front, this is the first time I've like properly done the Luminous thing. I wasn't a big PSP guy. I don't have that affection. Like I feel like a lot of my peers Lumines is like a seminal title for them. You know, I don't I don't really sort of ha have that relationship with it. If you've never played it before Blocks are dropping down onto a grid. They're two by two in design and they come in two different colours. The aim is to place the blocks so that you form a two by two square to begin with of one colour and then that becomes like a bigger block which can then be scored from but The aim is to build up bigger and bigger squares by placing the blocks to build the shapes from within the shapes. I'm not doing a good job of explaining that, but it'll make sense if you see it. It has this sort of r rhythmic uh element to it in that the blocks aren't scored until this scoring line passes over them, and that scoring line is sort of timed to the music so in very hectic songs it can move a bit faster in quite sort of slow tempo songs it moves a bit slower so you know the actual kind of like speed that you're having to kind of act at and think in is tied to the music so hectic tracks you have to be super fast and efficient slower tracks you can kind of take the time a little bit more and build up some crazy combos. I am absolutely terrible at this game. Even playing on easy like I was I was dying loads. But I can feel myself getting better at it and to me this felt like the sort of antithesis or maybe the antidote to what I was feeling. with some of those roguelike games where I felt like I was kind of a passenger on a power curve that was going to happen with or without me. I liked being reminded of the feeling of just getting my head around a mechanic and an idea that I wasn't familiar with and trying to master that. No way near mastering it, but you know, to begin with I I couldn't make anything happen. Now like I'm still getting like C's and D's, like the lowest ranks you can get in this game all the time, but occasionally I'll get a B And like occasionally on a particular run, I'll have managed to to sort of like plan ahead enough to build out a much bigger block which will trigger a big combo. or I'll use this uh mechanic called the burst mechanic, which I think is new for this one, where you build up this meter by by scoring points, and once it's full up you can trigger this burst mode where the aim is just to build one giant square and the bigger that square of one colour gets, it kinda pushes away blocks of an opposite colour, to sort of make it easier, and then that big block turns into just a huge scoring block at the end of the burst mode. There was a similar mode in Tetris Effect where you could like slow it down and you basically became superpowered for like 10 to 15 seconds and it has that energy and I I've just f found this a r a really satisfying experience, you know, that learning experience, but also then just drinking in the sights and sounds of this game, you know, every every board of it. I think they refer to them as skins, technically, every skin of each level. th the two blocks that you're juggling are very different things. Like it's very rare that it's just a coloured block. So in one, you know, you might be arranging green peppers and red peppers. In another it's like a seashell and a blob of water. or a candle and a lantern. And then those themes kind of bleed out into the background and and the music themselves matches it. So, you know, you you can get like a mad sort of shuddering bit of trance music while these two like robotic sort of skeleton hands are kind of grabbing at the blocks in the middle but then you have like yeah something a bit jaunty and high tempo when you're suddenly doing all these vegetables and it suddenly feels like you're in a kind of busy hectic kitchen and you know, then it's very, very calming music as you're arranging seashells in front of like, you know, a Hawaii sunset. And I just I like the the feeling of pinballing between all these different like vignettes and the different sort of emotions they sort of draw in you and the the different kind of pacing and tempo of the music. It just feels like, you know, your ears and your eyes are giving this like proper workout, you know, in the same way that that uh Tetris did. I actually find Tetris a much more relaxing game than this. Like I think there's always a baseline of stress in Luminous for me anyway, which means I can't just like, you know, fully kind of, you know, lose myself to the music or anything. But um Yeah, I just I just really like it. I really like the process of getting better. And yeah, I I really like goofy sincerity of all its like weird, dreamy visuals and you know, the song lyrics are all the soundtracks by this this group called Hydelic and they have a a p singer called uh Krista Young's uh who did a lot of the s the the songs for Tetris Effect as well and here, you know, they're all very similar, like these sort of, you know, lyrics about sort of trying really hard and and striving and we've all that we're all in this together and these big sort of nafs of cheesy sentiments while lovely visuals play out. I just uh I was really taken with it.

Samuel
01:20:05
Yeah, I I think that The presentation is amazing and I really commend the developers for like you say, onboarding you in a way that Luminez never had before and a great litmus test of how successfully they do that. is I went back to the existing Luminez game on Switch, um, which I can't remember the name of, remastered or Mega Mix or something like that. And I just got so much further in it than I ever had before because the techniques were ingrained from those tutorials. Like I just I remember the Saturday night that I just played every one of those tutorials back to back. And it's like intensive, but that's the point. They are like, we want to comprehensively teach you how to do this to get, you know, the the likes of you who have never been luminesc heads over that hurdle. and to really engage them. And so I really commend them for doing that. I think they did a great job. I did like this game. The I did, you know, the presentation is amazing. All those different skins are really good. And I did think the music was mostly great. In the same way that I really rated Tetris effect. I think that the difficulty of it I did struggle with because I think that the normal difficulty Makes sense up until a point and then I think becomes completely unreasonable. And so I bounced on it the third level from the end of Journey. There's the final I think it's like it's four or five in that level, four or five different skins. And when you get to the last one on normal The blocks just start dropping instantly. And there's like no The only way I think you can actually do it is if you have used the burst mechanic so comprehensively to keep the board clear. that those blocks can drop instantly and you can just you can just sort of make it work. And in general I think there is a bit of a s a structural, a sort of like an intriguing structural note to this game that is You are almost limping from one burst to another in terms of how you play it. Um, because you are dependent on that to clear the grid and just to keep yourself, you know, in the game. And I just thought it was too unreasonable, that last bit of that last level, and that's when I just uninstalled it. I was like, actually I think that I think I am good enough at this to do it. But I think this is like this is actually like this is a leap from what I perceive to be the right difficulty for this bit of the game because it jumps so It jumps so far, I was just like, no. I just no. I'm sorry. But it's a great it's a great achievement in so many ways, but You ask you ask too much. That is a hard mode ass twist in that level, and it's just too much. So I know that you've played it on easy and you've had a have a different experience, but

Speaker 3
01:22:47
I have played it on normal since, I should say. Okay, what the h entire game or just parts of it?

Matthew
01:22:52
No, no, not the entire game. No, I'm playing through journey on on normal as well, and it is much harder. I I I absolutely take the point, but I just f I almost feel like it doesn't it doesn't matter if I can't do it. If enough of it goes right, I still feel good about that. Like I can feel good about a good 20 second stretch of this. So even if I then lose I'm like, oh well, you know, I'm gonna get another D ranking. Like I don't I don't really care and I don't

Samuel
01:23:20
But I d if I don't know if it's just a different sort of ki kind of approach or I I I resent your healthy outlook on this and demand to you get in the toxic dirt with me, Matthew Castle.

Matthew
01:23:32
I think that it's the same but it is the same relationship we'll have with Tetrisvet. Like I'm not very good at Tetris.

Samuel
01:23:37
Yeah.

Matthew
01:23:38
And I think that has that has some of the same campaign problems in terms of there are there are a couple of levels where it goes so fast that your whole grid fills up and then that's the grid you start with. you know, when you then shift to the next sort of peaceful quote unquote grid. That is a weird tricky thing. I th you know they're definitely applying the pressure and then releasing the pedal and then applying it again. You know, they they're clearly having a bit of fun with that. But Um I don't know. I think I'd feel different like if I was anywhere near to being actually good at this game

Speaker 3
01:24:11
But but 'cause I'm just like, ah, it's good enough. Well that's a good way of looking at it. But I think that it's we it was within reach for me.

Samuel
01:24:19
I could feel myself getting and I just thought, ah, you snatched it away. You've just made it a bit too hard. And I think that Yeah, it just it was it was just a bit of a bummer. I felt like I was on that path to being like, oh I actually truly get this. I could really see this path to enlightenment. While I was slapped on the old accessibility settings like we discussed and I could actually see what was going on on every screen, which was helpful. Um and don't resent them making that artistic choice, but either because my eyes are fucked or like it's just too difficult to discern. Yes, I did fear the transition sometimes to a level where I was like, oh god, I cannot tell these light bulbs apart or whatever it might be. Um but uh yeah like it's I do think it's I I think if you can just let that go and it and and take it as an experiential thing, which is how I played Tetris Effect. I played it on my Oculus Quest and it was a great you know, just playing it on yeah, like a easy difficulty or whatever just made it a very steady and enjoyable experience. And For some reason I just decided I have to understand how this works. To t to enjoy it on the level I want to, you know?

Matthew
01:25:21
It it rubs your face in it a bit because there's so many more mechanics in Luminez, like scoring mechanics. you you are constantly aware that like something good is happening now or like nothing good is happening now. Like in Tetris, you know, it's so pure mechanically. is so stripped back, like there's there's not really a huge amount you can do with it where yeah here it is more of a thing. I mean it is the difference between You know, for me, Tetris effect is like a 10 out of 10, and this is an 8 out of 10. Like I do not think it is as good a game at its core, Lumines, as Tetris. Um but other people who maybe are good at the game and know how to get those high scores, they've probably got like more to work with here than they have Tetris. Like there's there's more to master and but there's also like mm more to irritate you at the same time.

Samuel
01:26:13
Yeah, it can never be quite as elegant as Tetris, that's the thing. Like it's Tetris is unmatched in that respect. Um yeah, it this is a game, this is a puzzle game that asks what have you done for me lately? And it is always asking you that. Um just watching that combo meter go up and then you see the same the same basic combo meter you just saw flash like several seconds ago flash again and it's like yeah that's because we had to restart again because I didn't have continuous success to feed into this game. And that is a that is a loop that is more punishing just by its design than Tetris, where it's very self-evident if you fucked up Tetris. You just look at the screen and you're like, yeah, that's a fucked up Tetris screen right there. Like, why what was I thinking with some of the placement of those L blocks, for example? Um Yeah, so I think the fact that it's inspired such a passionate conversation, like I definitely I think that if you uh have any interest in either Tetris Effect or Luminez historically on like the P in the PSP games or wherever you might have played it before, Xbox Live Arcade. It is still it is still good. I think I do agree it's an 8 out of 10, probably, but yeah, just I don't know. I just it was a bit of a slightly cool end to it for me, you know, for that very reason, Matthew.

Speaker 3
01:27:22
But Um good to have the video. I've got a piece of the soundtrack on uh YouTube Music. Very good.

Matthew
01:27:29
Very cursed insight into my life there.

Samuel
01:27:32
That and uh Kelly Clarkson's under the mistletoe, whatever it is. Underneath the tree, please. That's it. Sorry. I did listen to that song the other day and I was like, oh yeah, I do know the song actually. But I refuse to believe that a twenty thirteen Christmas song has entered the canon. Not in this Brexit ass country. Slater's still in that canon, but Kelly Clarkson is not, is my take, Matthew. But uh Well you know, I I'd be well out for the hydelic uh Christmas um anthem. That would have been quite a cool uh DLC for this game.

Matthew
01:28:00
I mean that would've been amazing DLC. They had play it on Christmas week and you get like a mad hydelic Christa Young's cover.

Speaker 3
01:28:08
of uh underneath the tree. Yeah, trying to match little snowmen and reindeers or something like that.

Samuel
01:28:13
Um or something more visually interesting than that that I'm sure they can come up with.

Matthew
01:28:17
In in uh Death Stranding 2 at the moment all the NPCs are wearing Santa hats.

Samuel
01:28:22
Oh that's cool. That's a nice touch. They've added um snow too. Oh no, actually I can't talk about that yet because that game's gonna come up uh a bit later in this podcast. So tantalizing tease there. I don't know if they've added snow though, Matthew, to my number nine, which is rematch because uh it's hard to play football with snow on the pitch, as we all know. So um sorry, I felt like a local radio DJ um with that kind of link. That was an incredible partridge-esque sample thing. What can I say? At least self-aware about it. Okay, so they made a football game where you only play one footballer on the pitch in competitive um 3v3. 4v4 and 5v5 uh matches. Um a superficially arcady game with an amazing amount of depth. Um it is pretty much all played online competitively. And the art style is this almost slightly like wooden sort of like carving type character design. Not a million miles away from um developer Slowclaps uh previous game, Sifu, which is also very visually distinctive. A really interesting game in the sense that it it gives you the kind of like the scope to do everything that you want a footballer to do with controls that are highly readable and like Unmalleable and just allow you to chain together everything you want to do in terms of passing, controlling the ball. flipping the ball over players' heads, volleying it. If you're a keeper, you can land the most precise throws and um and sort of um and goal kicks and It's really like this one-to-one with the experience of playing football. And I found that so refreshing in contrast to the likes of um FIFA and pro Evo where football is so abstracted in the way that you control these different teams. You do one thing with them and then you've passed it along and you never quite feel like you have that full level of control. But you really do in this game with this third person um camera. No game has given me more unbelievable highs and lows this year. Just uh ritual humiliation of someone saying, Good job, when you fuck up a really obvious shot where there's there's no one in goal. Um but then like the absolute elation when you you pull off um something unbelievable. um like flipping the ball over two players' heads and then kind of whack it in the top corner. Just what feel like feels like what I remember playing football at school in the sense that I would be shit 85% of the time. And then the other 15% I would do something miraculous. And I feel like I had that same thing here. And I did talk about early in this year about how our rematch really does remind me of what it's like being in that that situation and and the the absolute joy that football can kind of create, the fire it puts in your heart when um you are really locked into it. And I've just had some amazing games with this uh this year and like Uh uh so few games feel like they're the same because of that layer of level of player control. So when you're up against an opponent, the the skill level can vary so wildly that You can be completely out of your depth, even if you have a really good understanding of the game, because there are some people who just like really do just, you know uh sort of like understand how every little part of it moves, the like almost martial arts like precision of how you how you play this game. Um and it was really a A summer love affair for me rematch, Matthew. I banked 30 hours of it. I've not played loads of it since then, but that's just because there's been so many other so many other games. Um It's one to one with what C Fu accomplished, except in in football. And I think that's an amazing achievement. And uh yeah, so I I really rated it and you know I am keen to represent the multiplayer experiences that are meaningful to me in these lists because I think, you know, it's it's uh so many great things happen in that area of game design as well as the the really cynical bullshit that people hate, like the the endless character shooters and all that stuff. Like All of that happens, but then some remarkable things you've never seen before also happens in the multiplayer space and rematches one of those games for me this year. Thoughts.

Matthew
01:32:19
Mm. Uh Despolote DLC when?

Samuel
01:32:24
Uh yeah, I I like Despilote too, but uh football not quite as good, obviously. Um but yeah, two really goods you know, sort of like uh different perspectives on on football really, but where the love of football is is identical, you know? And they celebrate.

Matthew
01:32:39
I feel like I got to read lots of British Games journos being whisked back to their twelve year old selves this year, whether in rematch reviews or despilote of just sort of what it is to play uh not professional football as a kid. That's quite sweet.

Samuel
01:32:55
Hmm. Yeah, for sure. And I think it's telling that FIFA never really creates those memories, you know, but rematch does. So it definitely has done something new.

Speaker 3
01:33:04
And uh yeah.

Samuel
01:33:06
I don't really know uh sort of like what kind of long tail it would have, but I don't really consider that my problem either. It's a twenty one pound game, it was on Game Pass. Even if I only play it for those thirty hours, and I suspect I will play it for more more than that. Um, that was a a great investment and I really think that if this game would come along When maybe like in within five years after Rocket League, it could have been absolutely enormous. Um, but now there are so many things vying for people's attention that it's um And inevitably gonna be difficult to hold on to it in the same way. But that is not my problem. Um I'm celebrating the game design of this game. Do you think it's as good as Rocket League? I think it's what it offers is more more specific in its appeal than Rocket League. I think Rocket League is truly Arcadian, pick up and play in a way that this this simply is not. This asks you to reach at least a certain level of mastery of it before you go in. I wouldn't dare hand this to just a normie and be like, Off you go. You've really got to just like spend about ten minutes practicing before you actually know what you're doing. So um yeah, it's But it is um but it is phenomenal if you go on that journey with it. So uh yes, rematch Matthew. What's your number eight?

Speaker 3
01:34:14
My number eight is split fiction. Higher on my list. I knew there had to be one. It had to happen eventually.

Samuel
01:34:21
So my number eight is dispatch Matthew. Not on my list. I didn't think it would be. So yes, amazingly entertaining game. Possibly the second best superhero piece of media I've consumed this year after James Gunn's Superman film, which I enjoyed a lot. Really just um came out of nowhere as well. You know, I I I I there were like whispers of some ex Telltale developers have done this. Me thinking, well That was a game type that really had its day, and we all kind of moved on, and the games have diminishing returns, so how exciting can this be? And yet, it has become one of the, you know, the a true phenomenon of this year. Um it's a superhero workplace comedy where you are basically managing um a dysfunctional team of uh superheroes or kind of more like anti-heroes or borderline villains in some cases. And you're addressing emergencies around um Los Angeles, specifically the Torrance area, um, and you are basically navigating relationships of these different characters. You are trying to match the characters to the situations based on what their specialties or personalities are. And you yourself um used to be a superhero it players out in the prologue and then um something bad happened to you and so now being having this desk job is sort of what you've been reduced to. And then you gradually build these bonds with these different superheroes as you go. It is not even really as interactive as the Telltale games were, as a piece of interactive storytelling. It does have QTEs and it does have bits where you make choices that characters I will remember and that later have a bearing on the story. And yet, much of the time it feels like watching an animated um an animated series, but the animation is phenomenal. Uh there is no doubt in my mind that the management mini game in this does not deliver. The developers break the rules of it constantly to get the outcome that they want. They even in the last in the last um chapter of the game, there's there are eight chapters in total. They all take about an hour to finish, though the last one's slightly longer. They even mess with the percentages where what you see on screen, the percentage of um the percentage chance of you your suit your hero is finishing a mission is not what the game is actually doing. Um they can force failure even if you have like 71 and 69% or whatever. And you should be succeeding. I had this today. The game will say no, actually, you didn't do it. My question is why even have the percentages at that point? Why not just be honest with the player about what you're actually doing with the game? It does that kind of shit all the time as a mechanic where your your heroes can sabotage each other and completely fuck up your playthrough. There are friendship pairings that you'd only know if you play the game through twice and understand who the different friends are. Uh and I ask like why would you force players to play it twice to even understand that bit of the game? Because in a game with where choices matter, surely the first playthrough should be the one that is like the most special and the one they should be focused on. And so for that reason, flawed game, amazing piece of entertainment. And but still an easy recommendation, I think. It's twenty-five pounds. And especially to folks who don't play many games, much in the same way that The Walking Dead was when that came along from Telltale in 2012. I'd I actually have no real qualms recommending dispatch despite those misgivings, Matthew. Thoughts?

Matthew
01:37:35
Yeah, no, I I'd I'd agree with all that. Um, you know, I I enjoyed you know watching what I've watched of this. I think I'm about halfway through it. Yeah, I do wonder if there is a world where the actual like dispatch game is more of a game and you know this this really comes alive but then that that would come at the cost of like uh how light it is on its feet and how quickly it gets through those episodes. I do like the episode length and the actual length of the minigame, like within the the narrative cladding is is just about right. You know, so I think if you if you did kind of punch it up into something more and make it more of a strategy layer or something. But um I I like that setup, you know, and I like the You know, I like the idea of blending those two game types. Um yeah, I just wish the mini game was a was a you know uh a little less transparent what it's doing at times because yeah I've I definitely felt them grabbing the wheel but also pretending it's still meant things to have, you know, where do I invest my skill points and when do I use items and you're like, well, if you're gonna be deciding this stuff without me Do I really need to think about any of this? Yeah.

Samuel
01:38:47
Yeah, and so that's why I don't think it can be uh near the top of my list. Um so it has to be like bottom bottom five, but it is still like you can see a world in which a new version of what Telltale used to do happens, whether it's just through this developer or people take keys from it. It it really helps that they it looks so much nicer than those creaky as fuck Telltale games started to look late in the day. Um where they just the technology was not was not really up to scratch with what other games were doing at that time when you got to the late 2010s and stuff. But This is just so sharp. And even if if what you're what you're playing is not hugely interactive, it's a great way to consume a story, to enjoy a story. Um great characters, um, I think across the board. Even the ones I thought I'd hate I was quite endeared endeared to by the end. And the animation in the last episode in particular, absolutely outstanding. I think it really delivers on its finale. So I'd encourage you to keep going, Matthew. And um Yeah, like I say, 25 quid. I just don't think you can ask for more. I recommended this to two people who do not play mini games. They were both like fucking loved it. And That's that's great in itself, you know, because there are some people who are more interested in the story part and the gameplay part. We are more preoccupied with the gameplay part because of course we are. It's It's our background, it's what we're about. But um yeah, a recommendation nonetheless.

Speaker 3
01:40:04
What's your number seven, Matthew? My number seven is The Seance of Blake Manor.

Matthew
01:40:09
Not on my list This is Spooky Doorways uh historic detective game. You play an investigator called Declan Ward. who's looking for a missing person at a country retreat in rural West Ireland uh that is due to host a seance at the end of a weekend. So you have two days to find this missing person, in investigate all the other people and all the staff working at this hotel and work out what's going on. Now the conclusion I ultimately reached with Bleak Mana is that it's not necessarily the best detective game. Like in fact I don't think you really do much detecting. Like it's more about using your time wisely to walk around and harvest information about guests and the situation and the hotel itself and Once you actually have that information, the game does a pretty good job of mapping it all together into this big sort of like facts network and the the thing you have to deduce from it is is so obvious by the time you've collected all the information that I never really feel like tested in the way you would be in like a Golden Idol game or an Obra Din. So it's kind of nothing like those. In fact the main case where you're kind of whittling down anyone in this hotel who could be a suspect into the disappearance of this person, you know, that feels like that's gonna be like the big sort of act of detecting that defines this game and by the end I actually felt quite railroaded into what the solution was. Like I didn't feel like there was much challenge to that at all. So you know, maybe there was a time I thought this was gonna rank a bit a bit higher on my list than seven but th i the ending I was a little cooler on, which I hadn't played when we talked about it in the episode. But despite that I think the thing It does have this amazing vibes. It really sells you on being in this like creaky, spooky house with all these kind of weirdos, there's lots of like little groups of people kind of clustered in the library or in the dining room and you're kind of catching little glimpses of people and maybe of spooky ghosts and the floors are creaking and the doors creak and as the evening comes, as the you know you're you're working through the day in like hour by hour slots and As it gets darker outside, like the whole mood of the place becomes a little spookier, a little eerier, and it it's a really great like autumn-winter game. Like if you play it across you know, five evenings or something this Christmas holiday, I think it would really suit the mood of that. And it also does an amazing job of It's kind of been the closest thing I've played to capturing that kind of country house mystery that Agatha Christie used to do so well, where you have all these larger than life characters interacting with one another and getting to know them, get to poke around in their rooms, working out their schedules so that you can encounter them at the right time of day around the hotel. I think that's that is like the legwork that makes up like 90% of most mystery novels. And it's not stuff you tend to do in detective games, like they get to the act of like finding contradictions and accusing people, all the exciting stuff that comes at the end of the story. And I actually really like that they sort of you know, wallowed in that that weird investigative middle ground and like really let you kind of stew in this in this huge group of people and they've all got something to hide, they've all got a part to play in the mystery and I thought that stuff was was so brilliantly done and I've never really seen that someone kind of attempt to juggle that many characters as part of one mystery and I I really admired it for that. So It came out being, yeah, great vibes, uh a great attempt to kind of capture the sort of novelistic energy of of a traditional detective story, uh if maybe not like the next great sort of deduction game, you know, that people might be hoping for after say Obradin or whatever.

Samuel
01:44:19
Yeah, it was I don't think there's any game that I've not played from this year that I've read more about because I was really intrigued by the fact there was no initial critical reception to this at all apart from the Guardian and you.

Speaker 3
01:44:33
And no one else covered it. Well, I am the country's second paper of notes, so And so that slowly changed and more and more people have played it.

Samuel
01:44:42
Now it's popping up in all kinds of game of the year list. So Um you yourself and Keith Stewart basically carried the PR campaign for this on your back. It was probably Keith. I think it was more Keith. What you think the the Guardian with its like 80 million readers versus us with our six thousand listeners are somehow not the same, Matthew? Um yeah, I agree that that was um interesting, but I've seen so many different takes on this that like like what you're saying that as a detective game maybe at least something to be desired for some people, and that the focus on writing in the game means that it lives or dies based on that writing and some people simply do not like the some of the writing in this game or they find it inconsistent or I've seen a all manner of takes on this, but I am I am so up for it. And um yeah, I like I I think the the kind of setting in uh sort of context alone makes me intri makes me intrigued by it, as well as the fact that I kind of feel like I know what this developer's deal is having pray having played um Dark Side Detective and knowing that They're sort of like less mechanics driven and more like Isn't it fun if you poke at the world and see what kind of writing and storytelling it gives you back as a result of doing that? And so I kind of feel like I get what their deal is. Um but yeah, I mean it's uh interesting to hear you've called on it a little bit, but um it's also nice to have a more complete take on how how you feel about this game after the fact.

Matthew
01:46:07
Yeah, I just said when I was playing it, when I was in the middle of it, I was like, this is so good. This is so my jam like I thought, oh this this could be like my game of the year. Like I love this so much. I love being in this place. I think uh as I said in that episode when we discussed it in more detail, it has a bit of that hotel dusk juice in terms of like one place you become really like intimately familiar with and a set piece in this game is opening like a door that's been closed to you for ten hours and just going in and being like what the hell is in that room, I must see, I must know, and it's probably the same like chair graphic and bed asset that's in most of the rooms. But the the sensation of there could be something behind there is so strong and uh they they do such a good job of that. So Yeah, there was there's like a middle ten hour stretch of this where I was in just like mystery game heaven. Um And it it absolutely makes the cut for that. It's absolut the wild thing is they've got a Darkseid Detective 3 coming out next year.

Speaker 3
01:47:11
What?

Matthew
01:47:11
That's great. Yeah, they've announced that, yeah. I don't know if they were working on them in tandem, but that's like that's happening. Well good for them. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3
01:47:21
Spooky Doorway. They fucking make games. Haze Light and Spooky Doorway are Matthew's two favourite developers. If you make good games and you make a lot of them, I mean what what more is there to do? That's the formula.

Samuel
01:47:35
Well the other thing is that this game is I've seen it for about like twelve quid on Green Man gaming and stuff. Like you can get it pretty cheaply, so it's not like They're asking twenty five quid. Like if if you're even vaguely curious about the kind of detective experience Matthew describes there, won't cost you a lot of money to

Matthew
01:47:51
Dive in and see um see what the deal is.

Samuel
01:47:53
Um but still only on PC, right Matthew? So that's the other only on PC.

Matthew
01:47:56
It must come to console though, like it had such a good console control scheme. I played it with a dual sense pad and

Speaker 3
01:48:03
Yeah, it all made perfect sense.

Samuel
01:48:04
So Yeah, I will I will try and play this before our January episode and have um some kind of take on it because I do think it's the kind of Detective game, I'll be able to get my head around, so um yes. Oh yeah. We'll see how that goes, Matthew. Okay, my number seven is Avowed by Obsidian Entertainment. This is a first-person RPG by a studio who People only ever seem obsessed with talking about the games they they once made and not the games they uh have made um these days. See also um uh Pentiment from a few years ago. You know, there's some uh it's a really interesting studio. They had a really productive year. They put this out and the Outer Worlds 2 and also Grounded 2 came out this year as well. Um Pentiment was a few years ago, but like um you know truly some amazing output um from that developer. Um I really like this game. This is uh yeah, like a first person RPG set in an isolated part of the Pillars of Eternity universe, which I'm not that familiar with to be honest. I know it's their kind of like, you know, sort of container for um the types of um CRPG experiences they wanted to build back when they launched that Kickstarter. and uh made the two pillars of eternity games which are both very well regarded. It's about a land, it's called the Living Lands, and it's undergoing this kind of like uh cosmic plague basically um that threatens to kind of like completely destroy the land so um you're like commune with uh bits of like tree that uh like connect you to this the god that's behind this plague basically and so The entire land is under duress for various reasons, and I couldn't help but wonder if there was some kind of COVID inspiration behind the story, because it's like a way of life in these different settlements is being lives are being eroded by this thing that's changing the world around them. But what it amounts to really is a first person game where the combat is fucking amazing and it's not always a genre um that ha you know that yields amazing combat design. It's often functional combat and amazing storytelling. And I think that this game actually made a really great creative choice by being like, you know what we're gonna get right? We're gonna get platforming. Shooting, swinging a sword, all of that is gonna feel fucking amazing. No matter how you decide to play this game, it's gonna feel great. And so I went around the whole game with like a sword in one hand and a gun in the other. And at times it feels like you're playing something like Dishonored or whatever. It has that kind of like feedback where it it really rewards um whatever choice of weapons you've decided to kind of like put put into the mix. And it's so it's an interesting one in the sense that I think that it starts with its best map and then each map after that has slightly less impact. Um but I thought it was a really solid meat and potatoes RPG, um, married to that great combat. And it was I think a fifty or sixty hours I played in total. And I really love some of the side characters in this. You do have um a little party. You can only ever take two companions around with you at a time, but that's okay because there are only good two two good companions and in your party as discussed last week. Um Kai the Fishman being my um being my highlight. Um but it's a very like um It's a cool fact.

Speaker 3
01:51:09
So many times in this podcast.

Samuel
01:51:11
I should really look up what the uh the other the other companion I like is called, um just so I fucking have that to hand.

Matthew
01:51:17
Kai the fishman voiced by Garrus.

Samuel
01:51:19
Yes. Uh Marius uh the dwarf is uh who's also in the game as well. Um they may have uh it may have a non um a non-dwarf name in the Pillars of Eternity universe, I'm not sure, but they f they function as dwarfs. They basically live in Moria um and they have dwarf-related problems going on. So um That's definitely their whole deal. Um, and there's lo there's like a load of great narrative moments in this. Like early on in the game, you are I'm gonna say this because I think It is a spoiler, but I think it will tantalise people into playing it. And it is half off in the Steam sale right now. It's £30. And I think that's a great price for it. You get loads of game for that. You get like assassinated in the town square of like the first city. And then like you're you're basically like everyone thinks you're dead, but you basically are brought back from the brink of death. And you have to get out there and basically investigate who tried to kill you. It's a fucking great hook for like an RPG quest. And it's got a a bunch of different quests like that that either have like a cool choice associated with them. It's not like a massive um array of choices where the world will kind of warp in all these different ways. They're well-behaved quests, but they're really well written and constructed quests. Um And there's some quite bold storytelling in there, storytelling that I would perceive as political myself. Like I think that it's a lot of that inspiration you can really feel in the writing. And I I was just Pretty impressed with it overall. Like it's a like a solid 8 out of 10 RPG for me. And it feels a little bit like it deserved more attention than it got this year. Um but like I say, 30 quid, I don't think you can really argue it. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
01:52:46
I've only played sort of five or so hours of this, so I didn't I didn't didn't properly lose myself to it. But even from that you could tell that it was gonna be It f it feels quite like handcrafted, like the world is big but not so big that it just feels like a load of random caves with random loot. Everything feels like it's there for a reason. you know, there's you know very specific platforming, there's interesting buildings, interesting p you know, if you can get up somewhere, there'll be something interesting up there to find on purpose and yeah, I l I like that sort of that kind of intent.

Speaker 3
01:53:20
It's kind of this is almost what I imagine Playground's fable to be. Oh right, yeah, I can see that. Because there's sort of like it's not one big open world. It's like f

Matthew
01:53:29
Yeah, rather than yeah, rather than just a massive sprawl that's gonna feel really organic, it's something which is uh yeah, a bit more sculpted and focused. If Fable does have a bit of that energy and can get as much right as this game clearly gets right. That would be like a huge win. Yeah, for sure.

Samuel
01:53:46
It's uh you know, I mean what what were the the the worlds in Fable 2 and 3 but, you know, uh just a series of like self-contained locations really with little offshoots to go and explore. It's not like you were exploring th these vast sprawls in the game. And so yeah, I I actually really like that approach here. They did I think in the start of development they did plan on having an open world, but you I agree what what you end up with is Oh, it'd be really cool to climb that lighthouse over there. And it is really fun to do that. Or like I'm gonna climb this massive tree that over that overlooks everything in this world. And That feels really good. And it's really unusual for that to be the strength of a first-person RPG. It's not really what you think of this genre as doing. Um and so yeah, I think it just that that very specific configuration of elements. Um I think a vow's a little bit special. And I think over the years people will warm to it more and more and I hope more and people more people discover.

Matthew
01:54:36
I need to I need to pick this back up and go back to it. I clearly really like it. And it has like flint lock pistols as well. I love all that kind of, you know, steampunky kind of or whatever they call it, flint flint punk.

Samuel
01:54:48
Yeah it's got a few it's got a bunch of mushrooms as well. Um so if you enjoy the work of Jeff Vandermeer you may uh you may like the the sort of like The the sort of like amount of mushroom related activity going on. I endorse these mushrooms. But I won't do that, so I'll spare people that.

Matthew
01:55:10
Well that's uh that's actually something I can add to the personal developments this year. I've uh tried eating mushrooms again. Oh right, okay. And I've have you has your perspective changed? Well, when I have uh the the Kingsmead cook breakfast at the Kingsmead kitchen, I'll scrape my mushrooms onto Catherine's plate so she can have them.

Speaker 3
01:55:28
But I've had them twice this year. I've eaten mushrooms. I love some fried mushrooms, man.

Samuel
01:55:32
When I have bulldog noodles, I just chuck a load of fried mushrooms into that bad boy, the Carbonara one. And it's um it's a it's a treat, I tell you. Um but enough about that, Matthew.

Speaker 3
01:55:42
We move on to your number six. Mind number six is, he says if he brings up his notes. The root trees are dead. Ah, not on my list. Oh. S you surprise me. Detective Castle strikes again. Yeah.

Matthew
01:55:56
Uh this is a detective game came out quite early in the year. It's set in nineteen ninety-eight. You are investigating the family tree of a family called the Root Trees, which is a sort of candy dynasty. They've made all their money from basically selling fr fruit flavoured pastels. They really sound like round trees, but apparently The root trees, round trees, that isn't a thing. Like it's pure coincidence that he p he called them the root trees. But anyway. You're investigating this family, uh there's some kind of will dispute in modern day. So they've basically asked you to work out Who all the living relatives are. Like work out what is the state of this family and who might inherit this money because of it. You investigate the family using a 1998 internet browser, so quite rudimentary web pages, and you also have access to various newspaper and magazine archives. It's kind of a a sort of Sam Barlow alike. You know, it's a bit like her story or something like that where as you find information, you're typing it into this internet browser to search for keywords to see if you can find m more information if you can unearth more information because every person in the family tree you need to find out their name, their job and find a picture of them. And obviously that gets pretty tricky the further you go back in history. You know, you're going back through like five generations of this family and there's just less media about and It is yeah, it's it's a a huge deduction game. Like, if if this piece of information over here works alongside this, can we work this out? You know, is this person secretly talking about this person in this book they wrote and you know, whatever information you can find about them, you have to just fill it in and Then it does that Oberdin thing where every time you fill in three entries that are correct, it will tell you, and then you can kind of tick them off the list. But I love that process. I love the sense of trawling through information. I love deducing these things and coming up with the answers. I also really like that it's. not necessarily a story about like murder and traditional crime, you know, it's it's actually quite relatable, the idea of I just want to research this family and there are crimes in that family's past, but you know, this isn't a big sordid tale. It's actually some of it's quite wholesome. It's just nice to play a mystery game that isn't about who is this body and who killed them, you know, it's it's got more in common with like Facebook stalking like your old school friends or researching your own family tree on like ancestry. com. And I like that it tapped into probably sort of journalistic tendencies that lots of people have when they are you know, the internet is a powerful thing for sticking your nose into other people's lives. And I I kinda like that that that energy to it. I think the only thing stopping it from being a little higher on my list is that uh it has this like expansion, which is like a new part that they've made for this release called Root Tree's Mania. um which is sort of set a little bit after the the the events of the main game and I found that a little less satisfying. It wasn't that it was like sloppy, but it it was trying to be like harder I think than the main campaign. And I think the way that it kinda like it artificially sort of spiked some of the difficulty by just adding all this sort of bullshit which you had to then sort of, you know, work out sort of fat from fiction and I I didn't really enjoy that as much. So it's not a total slam dunk, but the the core game of investigating this family, a really original take on on a detective game and uh yeah, very satisfying way of spending a few evenings.

Samuel
01:59:46
Yeah, I I do like the idea of people taking those Sambarlo mechanics and, you know, sort of doing something a bit different with them because I feel like with his games they're always in service of telling some kind of personal story. It's it's like um it's in the Steam Cell, it's like thirteen quid Matthew, when um I got ten pound voucher and I am really tempted 'cause I have seen more people talking about this. The idea of like The Ancestry. com thing. It's a great that's like a genuine modern preoccupation for people of a certain age, and therefore it's a great uh sort of like framework to build a mystery around. So I am definitely intrigued by it. It's um it sounds cool every time you talk about it. But um that's that's true of all the detective games you play. You always make them sound so cool compelling so uh well it's just because it's my favourite thing it is yes and uh is it is this the last one on your list now it's not

Speaker 3
02:00:34
Oh wow, okay, bloody hell. Um truly uh a a massive year for this particular type of game.

Matthew
02:00:40
I was there was a point where I was only gonna allow one of them on my list and I thought, you know what, why why do that? They have three of my favorite things, that seems dumb.

Samuel
02:00:48
Yeah, plus I think it's what the listeners have come to expect from you as well. So um curious if this one would have made your list then, Matthew, based on the diminishing number of slots we have left. Promise Mascot Agency is my number six. It's my number five. Ah, well, then let's talk about it. Okay, so um this is a game that's come up many times this year, um so it's probably not surprising to hear us uh hear us discuss it again. It is a game set in a cursed Japanese town where you recruit mascots and then kind of manage them in this agency, sending them to different events to frolic essentially, doing things that mascots do. And um you have to pay off this massive debt. You are um a member, an exiled member of the Yakuza. Um and so you have you are now teaming up with this um with Pinky, who is basically like your co-manager. um uh a sort of like a mascot in uh the slash being um in the shape of a of a severed pinky but also has like big thumb energy. Um that's very much the the vibe of Pinky. An incredible character, an incredible cast of characters. And basically like a a PS2 scale open world um with uh visual novel elements. Um this is the developers of Paradise Killer. A game that I know Matthew liked a lot. And so it is really quite an interesting fusion of genres as an open world game. It's um it's got like busy work, but it's got a PS2 amount of busy work, so it is manageable busywork. A You are not gonna play this for as long as Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Um and that is most welcome, but it is still a world that's got cool secrets to discover where just going at going across it is um is and exploring and finding things is quite therapeutic. You have cool things you can unlock for your little um your little car that takes you around this world, um allowing it to go in the water and to fly. Um when it flies, that's fucking awesome and it goes faster and faster. And in general I just think it it succeeds at everything it sets out to do. It's really funny. Um it's got some really well-drawn characters, it's got loads of great little visual details in the world that give it personality, like the collectibles you find of um like a a t a like a tape of a a DVD of a certain anime that the is clearly referencing something in real life and all those kinds of touches that just enhance the feeling of this being le at like a real place. Um just really fantastic game and the first ever platinum trophy I got playing a game, Matthew. So um yeah it really um hit the spot. Thoughts Matthew

Matthew
02:03:17
Yeah, I'd I'd agree with all that. Uh I I just I found all its various loops so so so compelling For for me, uh as much as I love all the mascots and I love meeting all the characters and sort of unpicking their stories, which is the more kind of Visual novel feeling bit, you know, but that they're all great. Uh I I really like the core driving around in your little truck. collecting things and the truck getting like superpowered over the course of like ten hours to the point where, you know, a task that seems insurmountable from the outset, like how many things there are to collect. And then you're just absolutely sort of swooping all over the place, firing rockets, whatever. You know, you're so powerful by the end. Um i I think it's s it's like the first game s since Crackdown to really name th nail that Crackdown power arc. Yeah, I can see that, yeah. I was not expecting that to be true of this game about managing a mascot agency. It's and it's and that's just like one of the things which is really interesting about this game. Like great voice actors, so much specificity. so much clear developer love and intent in like everything it does. Yeah, just but it feels like like truly handmade. Like a you know, could only have come from these people, which in our world of fucking AI horror shows It's so reassuring that properly singular things can still happen and be this good. And also uh that a game that does have smart, interesting things to say about politics, but never ever gets bogged down. It like it's so light on its feet, so funny and silly and you know, it never kind of like lectures or sort of hectors you. It's it's just it's really, really well judged this.

Samuel
02:05:08
Yeah, it's also it's really cool to see you know, a a different a slightly different type of genre tackled by an indie developer. The idea of the the the PS2 scale open world game taken on by an indie developer is really exciting to me, but It it feels like something that no one's ever really taken on in the same way. I'd love to see other people tackle what's our version of Vice City, but all the things that inform what it looks and feels like and what the story is is nothing to do with Vice City because that's a really cool notion I think. Um Well done to Kaisen GameWorks. I'm glad you um you put this in your list, Matthew. I was a bit nervous it wouldn't make it for a second.

Matthew
02:05:47
No, no, it's just it's just it it feels like it's

Speaker 3
02:05:50
like being a core backpage text this year.

Samuel
02:05:53
Yeah. I just wanna celebrate it to I just want to make it very clear to people how good this is and you won't be disappointed playing this. So Okay, um okay so we come to my number five, is that right? Okay, my number five is Blue Prince. Not on my list. Is it really not? No. You're really gonna make me go to bat for blueprints. I was kind of expecting you to put it really high, and so I would have I would come in and be like W well I had mixed feelings on it, but XY and Z, it didn't make your list. I thought this was gonna be the other detective game on your list, Matthew, but It is not. I guess you've uh oh I know what the other detective game is, I figured it out. No you don't. Is it not the DLC for no. Oh! Then I have no idea what it is. Is there a detective chapter of Donkey Kong Bonanza that I'm not familiar with? The detective layer? Is that a thing that happens? We'll see. The Agatha Christie layer. Yeah.

Matthew
02:06:48
Turns out it was Cranky Kong what done it. It's just a country manner, except there is also Donkey Kong smashing through like pianos and stuff. And everyone's like, oh dear, who invited him.

Samuel
02:06:59
Okay, well I'm in the unexpected position of having to explain what Blueprints is, because um I'm the only one who put it in this top ten. I'm surprised this made you a list. Well, I guess I'll explain my rationale. So um Welcome to Mount Holly, where every dawn unveils a new mystery. That's the uh the ta the the log line of the game. Basically a game where you go to this same mansion every day, but the layout changes each day. And you have to build the layout as you go in board game-like fashion, constructing this vast layout and trying to figure out how to progress really and solve the mysteries of this um of this mansion. Um there's some sort of like poshboy inheritance nonsense in the story that I never really engage with, to be honest. But um the actual experience of going through this manor And it the rooms changing each time and you never quite knowing what you're gonna find the next day, like whether you're gonna see a room type you've never seen before, whether you're gonna unlock a a permanent element of progression, like uh some kind of advantage that you have each day or um you know like more steps to for you to get through this manner or whatever it might be um different advantages as you start each day. Um I just I found it absolutely Beguiling and so compelling. Like it was I was locked in when I played this, even though I think it is quite flawed and frustrating in different ways. Um R and G just has such a bearing on what kind of experience you have, whether it's a game you finish in 80 plus days like it did for me. Fucking monster of a a campaign just to see the first ending out of several, um, or finishing it in 20 days um in a complete breeze, which seemed to be other people's experience. And as you go Having to repeat these different types of puzzles over and over again, including these horrible bullshit dartboard puzzles that basically ask you to have like sort of fucking complex mathematics knowledge that no normal person has because everyone knows people who study math are uh a level and above a absolute psychos and so why would you want to get involved? You could be studying drama or or English literature. What are you even doing?

Matthew
02:09:00
Where's anti-math screed coming from?

Samuel
02:09:02
Well it's more that like I feel like In some ways that you y I mean, it's made by a one person developer, Tonda Ross, so I'm probably pronouncing that incorrectly, but it it feels like a game of one person's interests kind of manifests in such a specific way. that I think the game doesn't really care if you like it or not. And I do actually really like that about it. It's it really is like not afraid to be you know, impenetrable or difficult and to not meet you halfway on certain things. And I think that it made it a great shared moment of this year to see how other people engage with it, how other people would be frustrated with it, how other people would just absolutely adore it. How some people would really lock into the story, how some people like me would just sort of write the story off because who cares about posh people? It's not interesting. Um and so even though this kind of like puzzly game that is you know, it's just it's just stacks upon stacks of different puzzles and like meta puzzles in this almost like uh I guess like the witness-esque kind of way, where you're trying to put together what the larger picture is over the course of days. I think it's just it's kind of a great moment that happened this year. And I really just even even with all the frustrations it gave me, like it was It's a singular game, man, and I think it really deserves the success that it's had and the critical acclaim that it's had. So, yeah, I I'm surprised it's not on your list. I thought this was Even with its flaws, this is a just a you just it's undeniable from this year, you know?

Matthew
02:10:33
Yeah. Oh i is it's an it's an undeniable like one of the games of twenty twenty five and Definitely that month everyone was playing it and discussing it. You know, I enjoyed being part of that. I enjoyed observing it. I just think fundamentally I f I felt more frustration playing it than I did Elation, and I feel like I had a smoother ride of it than you did. I'm f fundamentally opposed to the idea of a a game where there is mystery and things that you want to experiment with, that you can sort of come up with theories that you want to test. But then you can only test them if the game serves you up the right rooms, you know, according to its its bizarre rules and It's not really a mark against the game, it's just how my brain works. I you know, I I want to be able to investigate things. the route my brain wants to investigate them and that is just not the mindset you can have for the blueprints. Like you you have to meet it halfway. You have to play by its rules and basically investigate what it allows you to investigate on any given day given the rooms it is served up and I could never quite get out of that headspace. You know the the games the the sort of thinky games that I like, you know, are games which let you think about them on entirely your own terms. And I found it it's crucially too irritating that this game didn't. So despite playing it loads and ge getting, you know, reasonably deep into it, I I I just could see how much more there was to it that I was never gonna be able to work out and I just didn't want to give it a hundred hours to have a chance of working that out and It so i i it at the end it left a bit of a bitter taste to be honest. Um that definitely like You know, when people are like, oh you've beaten you've got to the end room, oh well you've uh well done for beating the tutorial, you've got ninety-five percent of the game left to go, and it's like, well, I hate it then. I'm just not interested in that.

Speaker 3
02:12:38
Well that's just the dickhead who says that.

Matthew
02:12:40
Yeah, I know, but I c I I can't also divorce this game from from some of the incredibly smug people who surrounded it.

Samuel
02:12:50
Yeah, I get that, but it's sort of like I don't know, it's uh I think you've said nothing incorrect there. Um but and even though I was far angrier at this game than you ever were.

Speaker 3
02:13:01
Yeah, yeah.

Samuel
02:13:01
I just think I don't know. I mean, it's not something I would normally engage with, but it properly locked me in. And um even with all those flaws in mind. and the knowledge that I will never ever go back to it. Nor do I even really want to know what the secrets are. I don't really care. I've no I don't need to to to know any of that. I just uh yeah, it's a game that was not afraid to be uh you know, to really just like uh confound you and leave you thinking, what the fuck was that? And I don't know, I like the idea that nothing diluted his vision of what this was. And I I s I wanna I want to celebrate that very precise cocktail that makes this game, you know?

Matthew
02:13:42
Yeah, absolutely. I'm I'm not questioning that at all. Like I don't even disagree with it being like in the top five of people games of the year or being nominated for game of the year or or any or it winning awards or anything like that. Like I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just my personal experience it it's just opposed to what what I enjoy in a in a more cerebral game.

Samuel
02:14:05
Yeah.

Speaker 3
02:14:06
Uh okay, well that's um that's fair enough, but uh I'm glad we at least got to talk about it in this episode. I didn't think that was gonna be the point of disagreement in this episode. Well I honestly assumed Blueprints wasn't gonna get a look in from either of us. Yeah, no, I it was even it was higher than this.

Samuel
02:14:21
It had it at four. Uh it never got as high as three, but I was definitely um interesting. There was no doubt it was like one of the first games I put in the list. It's been there ever since. It's not You just it yeah, there was just a there's like a f a 30-hour block of time that it was just deleted from my year by this game. I just remember playing it on my Steam Deck in bed nonstop. And uh I can't I can't tell you to not try and have that experience because i it's worth it even if it even if it kicks you in the balls repeatedly for a laugh, and it will.

Speaker 3
02:14:51
It's still worth having. So uh yeah.

Matthew
02:14:53
If I'm playing the Root Trees and I've got a I've got an inkling that Grand Pappy Root Tree was in Boston in 1913 I don't wanna wait for five hours for the fucking library to turn up, for me to look up Grand Pappy Root Tree. That is that is just how it is.

Samuel
02:15:09
Yeah, and it's it also not the only game from this year where its fan base is so unbearable it makes you question whether you even like the game in the first place. I That That is like a common occurrence of this year. Um yeah, quite a lot of people vying for like worst fan base this year.

Matthew
02:15:24
So yeah.

Speaker 3
02:15:25
That should be a category uh to Keely's game awards this year. What's your number four, Matthew? The 100 line, Last Defense Academy. Uh not on my list, but uh is on my Steve Wish list, Matthew. You know, I'll come clean.

Matthew
02:15:38
I haven't done all hundred endings of this, um, as should have been evident from our conversation with Lucy a few weeks ago. It's a strategy RPG embedded into a vast visual novel structure that takes its cues from Zero Escape Series. in that you have to explore all these different branches of alternate history to get the kind of complete picture. So something you learn in branch one may reveal something more in branch five and so on and so forth. But because of that branching structure and because each of those branches, you know, is a f fully featured story in its own right. You know, this is a game which can famously take you up to 200 hours to reach all 100 endings, which I have not done yet. But I will keep chipping away at it. I think it is that structure that I fundamentally love, maybe more than, you know, the strategy RPG element, though that's that's also fine for reasons I'll go into, but What I love about Zero Escape and Uchikoshi, who is the creator of that and is like one of the key writers on this one here. is that depending on the order you approach one of his stories, you get to know different information at different times, and you get to know more about different characters in different orders. So information you bring from one telling might impact and colour how you perceive a character in like another branch of the story. That's quite an interesting way of doing a branching narrative where it becomes this big sort of soup of cross-references and your sympathies are gonna be constantly shifting based on how little or how much you know about any one given character, the order you play it in, you may really you know, hate someone and then realize in another storyline that they have the capacity for great bravery or great kindness which changes your reading of them and I think that stuff also bleeds quite nicely into the strategy RPG elements because in the stories different people live and die in different branches. The actual characters you have on your side to like fight alongside is different in each branch and it avoids you ever just becoming over-reliant on like your five favourite party members because there might be a version of history where they are now all dead and you suddenly have to work with all these characters who you didn't really rate before. So I actually think it draws out the best in that kind of like sort of almost like fire emblem style game where you're protecting this school over the course of a hundred days. So I I just I think it's uh i incredibly ambitious, but also somehow in those hundreds of hours doesn't really lose sight of like what is really good about this structure. You know, it's not just doing it for the sake of doing it and showing off like they're There is a reason and there is kind of a reward for m for making a story like this. And I think that's the thing that really impressed me. Like I've seen him sustain it over 30 hours but sustain it over a hundred to two hundred hours. That's something entirely different. So it's a a really neat game. You just have to have a a strong appetite for anime bullshit.

Samuel
02:18:52
Haha This is a proper real heads no game of the year and I really liked um what Ash said about it when he did the um his little segment of last week's episode. Uh it was his game of the year. Um and uh yeah it's uh it's it's something that I only really only really the time commitment of it that's put me off playing it really. And um at least within this window in which we, you know, play the game is to actually reach the end of the year list. Um however I definitely will play it at some point. It's it's an interesting quirk of the the modern age and it goes I guess goes back to what I was saying earlier about the idea that games want more time from you than ever. And sometimes that's in service of roguelike mechanics and sometimes that's in service of peeling back the layers of a story, as this does. And as Silent Hill F did this year. And um yeah, I kinda like the uh you know, the the idea of asking people to get involved um but also setting expectations Matthew because it does feel like uh it will really reward you if you go on this journey with it game but also it's not a journey that everyone that's gonna be for everyone, you know.

Matthew
02:19:55
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean it I I just from the outset you think 200 hours like no chance, but uh I don't know. There is something to be said. I think you could probably just play through the core story and have a pretty good time with it. But um yeah, you'll find yourself hooked for sure by the end.

Samuel
02:20:13
What is the Ash said like two hundred days was the was the sort of optimal one Matt he he says something about something about like how long you should at least play it for to get the sort of like idea of what it is and to To see some pretty cool stuff. But um yeah. Although I feel like in a similar kind of um in a similar sort of bracket I have 13th Sentinel still unplayed from like five years ago. So yes. Um I'll have to weigh that up. Um cool Matthew. Uh right. What is your number for? My number four is a little game called Arc Raiders, um, which really uh sums up the difference between you and I, doesn't it? The uh you picking Hundredline and me picking this. Not a game I thought I would get into at all, to be honest. Um I can't think of a more boring genre name than Extraction Shooter. What were they think were they thinking, the people who coined that? Like that's like saying office that's like office temp work um is a genre name. Like, don't do it. Like it sounds boring as shit. What were you what were you thinking? However, this game did break open that genre for different people, and what that genre is is basically going into uh these maps that where other players are vying um for a finite number of resources with you and then trying to escape the map before you are shot dead um permanently as in there is permadeath in this game. And people take your stuff, meaning that you leave with nothing. But if you get in, get out, maybe kill some players along the way, then you're gonna have a really exciting and rewarding time playing this. And even better, what if you encounter those players and you form some kind of fragile alliance or a very brief truce or you just pass ships passing in the night and you just say Uh have a good evening mate, which um I've heard Phil Savage say um while playing this game um at least a couple of times. Going in going into these maps and never really knowing what's gonna happen. So it's a really compelling game type if you can get it right, and They have with Art Raders. It is a game set in a future earth where these mechanized uh I guess they are basically just like fancy robots have taken over the have taken over the world and silo style you are underground in this city called Speranza um just trying to uh uh make keep humanity going basically and so you periodically have to go up to the surface to um to to farm resources and take them back with you and continue civilization. That's basically the setup of the game. And so what that amounts to is you load into a map. There's 30 minutes counting down and you have to uh basically see what you can make of it. Maybe you'll have a run where you kill a few robots, you get some um get some sort of like parts for crafting, then you kinda leave again. Or you might have a run where You find um the blueprints to uh to create a shotgun, um which you can then do permanently if you can get it back to your base in time. You'll encounter a few human players where They might say don't shoot using the in-game voice commands and then start shooting anyway and maybe you'll overcome them and um and make off with their stuff. And then maybe you'll have a a a last second escape where you call up this um you call like the metro and um you climb onto the metro and you're ready to leave, but then some other players just suddenly jog on and start shooting you. But you hit the controls anyway. And you escape with your stuff regardless, and you go, phew! I made it out with all of my stuff and had some awesome player encounters as I went. It's really hard to explain why this game is so magic, but It's really good at creating those emergent narratives, basically. The the thing you always used to get from playing Day-Z, but you sometimes had to wait hours and hours to do. They found a game type, a container for it. Where you can have those moments constantly, those Walking Dead style moments where you never know exactly how people are going to behave. And it's it's been great for that. And the It's wonderful fun to play in trios. You have so many more firefights that way, but people seem to be having a more wholesome time with it playing it solo and just kind of like Getting on with their stuff and just everyone shouting don't shoot each other and the joke I've made two times before, people just playing it like Animal Crossing, going back and crafting their shit basically. And however you enjoy it um is good by me. But I've I've I really enjoyed playing through it in trios because the objectives in the game are completely rudimentary. They go here, pop this on this, come back with a copy of this, and It's really straightforward like tick box fetch quests basically, but they give you just enough of a through line to keep you wanting to progress because they give you more and more kind of like permanent upgrades and and sort of like you know heighten the ceiling of what you can actually achieve on a given run and Make it feel less intimidating the more you play. One of the objectives was fucking go to this memorial and stick this hat that's fell off of this little stick. onto back onto the stick again. And you do that and then the objective is complete. You're like, that is a such a fucking like naff objective really. But it they are just excuses to get you into the field to create these little choke points where you're like What if I just hung around this junkyard where I know like newbies have to go to do this and just hunted them down and like took their stuff? And that is a way you can play the game and it have you done that? Have you picked on newbies? No, but I did say to Phil and Tom What if we just had bastards evening where we were like, forget the way we've been playing this to date. Forget our conventional morality where we do not shoot unless we are shot at. What if we are just the dickheads? And I think their response was like, they laughed, but I think they were like, that is the most Samuel Roberts thing you could possibly uh suggest. Um but um that has not happened yet. We still play it like the way we would like people to play it, which is We get on with our stuff, we don't shoot each other, and so um and so yeah, it kind of goes goes from there really. But yeah, some uh really different kind of like map designs in this. I talked about Bluegate last week, um a great open world kind of like map to explore, but There's some like really kind of fiery areas in this where you just go into these town squares with a fucking massive robot patrolling it and there's loads of people vying for the same stuff. It's so great at creating player drama and so uh undeniably my sort of like key multiplayer experience of this year. Thoughts, Matthew.

Matthew
02:26:23
get a slightly better idea of what it is and um it becomes more and more enticing. I just I'm so out of the multiplayer ecosystem. Like I just don't have anyone that I play multiplayer games with. that I f it feels like that's so integral as having the right group of people. Maybe this is maybe this is what we could play on the fabled backpage stream Oh that might be good, yeah. Um You could s you could take you could show me can you do it in duos or would we need a third person?

Samuel
02:26:49
I think they might have calibrated it so you can play in in duos. Um Yeah, I'd be curious to know what you kind of made of it. I think you might have two or three really bad experiences and bounce on it. And that is the strange thing about it is you can have an evening where all the right things happen, where you make loads of progress. Then you can have an evening where you fucking lose everything. And we've had both, I would say, about six times we've played this, maybe like four or five times, but It's wild highs and lows playing this.

Speaker 3
02:27:15
Um yeah you lose everything. Is it literally back to square one as if you were a new player?

Samuel
02:27:21
No, they very I think they very smartly calibrated this um in a few clever ways. So you have a safe pocket in the game. So if you find a particularly juicy uh sort of like blueprint or weapon that you want to stash. Or maybe not weapon actually, but like let's say you find a a key to a location on another map and you know you can get some cool stuff there. You can pocket that I an item to take away with you. So it's not a complete bust. You can leave with something cool. And like I say, as you accumulate blueprints, you can make more and more Of the guns that you used to have to collect in the field from scratch. And you get more and more money and there are vendors you can just go of replace your your loadout with basically without it costing that much. I think they've thought very carefully about not making it too punishing. Um whereas my big my sort of bummer playing Marathon earlier this year was just like it felt like s proper square one each time. And that didn't even have the the distinction of the maps being cool. Those maps were like really boring FPS maps. Um these maps are just are hot shit. They're very distinctive places. Um they're not all great, but um at least two of them are really good. And um I'm curious to see what they add to it. But uh yeah, it's a good candidate, Matthew. That or the um the roguelike mode in Hitman um world of assassination. Those those can be the things we can maybe play on our stream. Exciting. Indeed. So that's Arc Raiders. Yeah, it lived up to the hype. There was some uh there's a butt slight bummer with AI voice stuff in this, which seemed like a completely unnecessary. Um thing for the developers to get into. They got loads of money. Um so don't do that. It's my advice to them. And uh yeah, but that's just want to throw that navy in there. Yeah, I just don't see the I d their justifications seem completely flimsy to me and Just it's it's to bummer about an otherwise wonderful multiplayer game. I hear Joe Screbbles liked it on the um for his clip in the last episode, Matthew. So uh it's a proper you know, if if Joe says it's good, it must be good, basically.

Matthew
02:29:17
Um It must be good. What's your number three? Mind number three, I have talked about this on the podcast. It is a free itch game type help. Oh yeah, I remember that. This really annoying thing happened with Type help where when it appeared on the scene, loads of people loved it and told everyone they should play it. No one really likes to say what it's about because th the nature of the game, it's one of those sort of like, oh you kind of discover it for yourself. But I I think that you ni you need to know some basics. So you can skip ahead five minutes if you're desperate not to hear anything, but I just don't think anyone tries these things on if you just like trust me and then leave it at that. So it's played in browser uh on itch. You can just go and play it now. You are an investigator looking through audio transcripts of events uh at a place called Galley House where there has been a crime. I can't remember if at the outset they spell out the nature of the crime or what's happened and why you're investigating it. It's been a little while since since I dug into the opening of it. But the way that you are interacting with events is through typed transcripts. There's no music, there's no sound effects, there's no dialogue in this game. It's just typed documents on a computer interface. There is a a sort of introductory puzzle about how you access those documents. which is like the first aha moment that everyone has to go through and and sort of work out for themselves. But once you are into the the meat of the game You are basically following people in this house around the house and you are trying to track where people were and when. That is the challenge of the game. Like you're just trying to create a picture of everyone's movements in this house across a certain period of time. And you have to do this by listening, well, reading very closely to what they say. You know, sometimes someone will literally say Oh, I've just got to go off to the dining room and get something. And you're like, well, I know that in the next scene that person's gonna be in the dining room. So that's that's like a a a given fact, but like It's rarely that easy. Sometimes you have to sort of reverse engineer the past from things people say later down the line, like remember when we talked about blah in the blah? And so you get a little sense there. Sometimes I'm The number of ways it hints at where people are gonna be, it's that that's that's just a huge part of this game's magic. It is one of those deduction games like Oberdin, like Golden Idol. I would say it's almost one of the purest versions of that I've ever played. Just because you only have this text to go on, you end up holding this whole location in your head. This whole game has to be like conjured in your imagination. Now what a lot of people have to do is they play it in one window and they have another desktop window open with a Google Sheet or an Excel doc. to track people's movements because it's so complicated there's no way that you can just hold it in your head. But I I loved the act of having to like imagine this scene and in that it plays with what it is you're imagining. You know, you you you might learn these people's names, but it may take a while to work out their relationships or their age or who's powerful and who's not and and the different preconceptions you bring to that, you know, can put this crazy spin on the whole thing. So It's just so incredibly clever in the in in how much of a world it builds from these very cold text documents. Uh I w I was so sort of taken with it. My my two tips for this game are, well, one, the Google Sheet thing. You'll definitely want that to track people. Um second Find a bit of like appropriate music to play on your computer at the same time, because it doesn't have any music of its own. Like I just had this incredibly generic like eight hour like jazz noir mix on YouTube and it completely set the scene for it and it it just had the right vibes. But that's also key to unlocking some of its magic. You just want to create as much of the atmosphere of the game as you can as possible. It's it's really really good. Has moments of revelation That are as good as anything in Oberdin or Golden Idol. And also the nature of what's happening in the house Once you have worked it out, it's so satisfying to go back through everything with that information. It's it's one of those stories where There's a lot of things that don't quite make sense that suddenly you're like, Oh, I completely get this whole thing. Like it's a real rub your face in in how not how obvious it is, but how clever it all is on a second read through. So Even if it didn't have all that investigation stuff, even if it was just a straightforward bit of storytelling, uh the actual nature of of what's going on is is so cleverly executed in that piece of writing. Yeah, I th I thought this was just just absolutely brilliant really. The big mystery of this is that they're the team that made the root trees are dead. or the team that remade that for to s to Celex. That was also an itch game originally. They're doing a similar thing for this. They're turning it into a more traditional adventure game, which seems to have As far as I can tell from the artwork, like graphics and character art, I don't know if it'll have voices. I cannot imagine how they're gonna pull this game off if you can see stuff. Because so much of it is you trying to interpret what it is people are looking at. You know, when someone's like, oh my god, you're like, well, what are they looking at? I can't see it, I can only hear it. And yeah, that is like one of the great mysteries of 2026. How the fuck are they gonna remake this game without completely breaking it? We shall see.

Samuel
02:35:16
So how long do you reckon it'll take you for a complete playthrough of this, Matthew?

Matthew
02:35:20
F four to five hours.

Samuel
02:35:22
Oh, that's alright, so it's definitely like a do it in one evening kind of job.

Matthew
02:35:25
Kind of, yeah. I mean the game has um you can save it and you you can like through the the browser itch thing you can download your save and pick it up again if you don't do it. But yeah I'd say it's yeah you could one evening of like I'm just gonna sit down and do this thing. I think it'll be pretty obvious in the first twenty minutes if it's for you or not.

Samuel
02:35:47
Right, yeah.

Matthew
02:35:48
Like if you enjoy the process, then there's loads of that process to look forward to. If you don't, then that's all the game is. So Like you're either in or you're out.

Samuel
02:35:59
Indeed. Well, um I forgot I forgot to do that thing people ask us to do where we say the names of the games again. I'll say it right here for this one. Type help. I will also link this in the um the show notes, I'll just say it's Matthew's uh number three and um you can play it here just to not spoil it. But um yes uh a pretty easy recommendation isn't it? Just go off and check that out for free. So um Wow got so high. All those other detective games it muscled out. Type help, what out.

Matthew
02:36:24
I just thought it was so pure. It's so like focused. Yeah, I absolutely brilliant. What an interesting thing to give away for free as well. It must have been an enormous amount of work to get this. Making sense.

Samuel
02:36:36
It's really interesting with you to see what you value when it comes to logic of the mystery versus like accoutrement of the mystery. Because that is like the push and pull with you, right? Because It's not like every ace attorney mystery is a fucking banger, but the the sort of comedy nonsense that occurs around the edges and like the characterization or the or the drama. You know, that's like a or the music is like a massive part of the appeal of it. But here you've opted, you've rewarded the most pure detective experience above all others, which is quite interesting, you know?

Matthew
02:37:07
Yeah, it's I tell you what it almost is, there's this I mean I I don't think this is better than, say, Oberdin, for example. I still think that's like the king of detective games, but You can see a transition from that, which is like full 3D environments you can walk around that are like rich with information. And then a level down from that you have Golden Idol, which is the crime scene as one basically static image. and the information you can get from that to this which is no visuals at all, just sound as rendered in text. And it it it's just quite interesting seeing them basically all do the same thing but with like fewer and fewer tools to actually execute it. Um I well I find that interesting anyway. It might not be for everyone. But if if that transition uh ki does catch your imagination, uh type help is definitely for you.

Speaker 3
02:38:05
I think I might be more of a Blake Manor simpleton, to be honest, man. Yeah. Interesting.

Samuel
02:38:19
Okay. Well, um we come to my number three then. Which I have a feeling might be higher on your list. It's Donkey Kong Bonanza, Matthew. It's higher on my list. Okay, then we come to your number two.

Speaker 3
02:38:29
Death Stranding 2 on the beach. Ah, not on my list.

Matthew
02:38:33
I had to include this. I don't know if it's how easy it is to recommend people who haven't done the whole Death Stranding thing, because. One of its great strengths as a sequel is it gets to what's fun about Death Stranding, which is fundamentally a game about a man walking over an open world and linking up society by making deliveries. You sort of deliver things between various bases and factories and military installations. And Death Stranding 1 was a a a lot more hard work than Death Stranding 2 because I feel like it had to establish like this world and the rules of the world and it had to do quite a lot of heavy lifting which made it very slow at the beginning and Walk very slow throughout 'cause it was constantly having to introduce these quite knotty, confusing ideas and death stranding two Because it just sort of assumes you know what's going on with all that. It can just sort of get into a far more relatable story for starters. So it's far more driven by the characters uh Sam Porter Bridges played by Norman Reedus, like there's a there's a more emotionally resonant event that kicks off this story and and drives him through it and he meets people who are, I'd say, more recognizably human and more winning than like the freaks and weirdos who dumped exposition on him in Death Stranding 1 But you can only do that because you have done all that crap in Death Stranding 1, basically. So your mileage may vary based on that. And the second strand of it is that mechanically Kojima basically loads this up with all the ideas that he developed in the course of Death Stranding 1 and then just goes crazy with it. What started as a almost a simulation of hiking across difficult terrain where you had to like balance your body weight and make sure you weren't like overburdened by carrying too much and There was like a quite a yeah very physicsy sort of simulated element to it. In this by halfway through this game there You've got jump pads that launch you through the air like Mario and you fly around in slow motion and then you land perfectly safely, you know. There are all kinds of like weird gadgets and gizmos that that sort of fling you and catapult you over this map and it's it's completely ridiculous and it feels like it's Tapping into something completely different to the first game. Well the first game was sort of edging towards that, but it was just a bit more sort of serious-minded. You know, this is a game where Yeah, like you say, you're catapulting yourself over the top of a mountain, or you're catching demons in like special grenades, which are basically poker balls, so you can then summon those demons at a later point to attack people and Everything you do in this game earns you a new gadget or gizmo, which makes it more and more outlandish and more fun to play and I think people tend to sort of forget this about Kojima, but he is a b you know, a big ideas guy and his games, you know, he clearly surrounds himself with big ideas people who pack the game with like weird little interactions to find and odd things that can happen and this game there's so much more of that. It's it's really just like wading through what like m mad bullshit is have him and his like developer mates come up come up with next and uh I I found it such a such a pleasure to kind of get to grips with, you know, on top of all the the more meditative elements of meditative elements of traversing this landscape and bringing order back to this kind of chaotic land, you know, that that it can do all that at the same time that, you know, the zip lines are getting wilder and the vehicles are stranger and There's all this like automated things you can build to make the process smoother and I I find it such an intoxicating like wealth of ideas that I I just c couldn't help but sort of be impressed by it i i it really isn't for everyone, but if you are at all tuned into the the Death Stranding thing, I d I just thought it was such a such a better game, so so much more fun than the first game. Some extraordinary cutscenes, beautiful music. It looks absolutely unbelievable. It's so cutting edge. And it's like also just as a PlayStation 5 exclusive. You know, it's it's a game that just uses every bit of that hardware, you know, the dual sense movements, the triggers and the tactile vibration and all that. It you know, he really pulls out all the stops and is trying to impress you. It's a a great first party showcase, you know, which maybe doesn't matter to people, but I I do like it when people like really do pull out all the stops like that. So yeah, just Just just a a a great all-round game this.

Samuel
02:43:28
Yeah, really interesting in in the sense that I think that what you identify there about the first game being kind of divisive, um, or at least like an acquired taste, means that the number of people it feels like there aren't that many people out there to really tell the story of what this game is. Like I I think it's a kind of Right. You are if you're in when I felt like when the reviews came out, all the people who were invested in the first one were like, come and play this. But I think you actually do need it laid out as you lay out there to be like Actually this is the kind of like Kojima firing on all cylinders game that you desperately miss from the days of Metal Gear, and he's doing it here. But you might have to you ha you have to, whether you like the original Death Stranding or not, you have to push through that in order to see all this other cool shit that he's made for you. Um but it just feels like this ended up being a bit under the radar this year for whatever reason. Um in the versus some other blockbusters. Like it I don't think it sold anywhere near as much as Ghost of Yote did, for example, which suggests that maybe the PlayStation audience are like May just it w the first game was perhaps a little too strange for them, a little too you know, like maybe not exactly what they wanted from Kushima. No, it sold well. But I feel like the people who really loved it was maybe a small percentage of that audience. Whereas with Ghost of Yote, it was like we've kind of made the same thing for you again, but with some nice additions. Um Yeah, it's almost like you have to get through that kind of gateway to get to all of this stuff. Um which does sound exciting when you put it like that.

Matthew
02:45:01
So uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it is it is wild. If I was still working on games magazines, there's like a thousand box outs you could do about this game. Like so many weird little things can happen and like magic moments and things which feel like huge lifts, but you'd only ever find them if you know, you really paid attention and you followed certain weird instructions. The fact that it's the kind of game which has added Santa hats to all the NPCs because it's Christmas, like it's It's just one of those games. It's like a game that's, you know, seems to care a little bit about how it's how it's perceived and it just always puts on a show. Um also like you know, not to be too leering Kojima emoji from our Discord, but like he does cast some incredibly beautiful actresses and they get to do some amazing action sequences. The stuff with Elle Fanning in this, the fight choreography that she does in the cutscenes is unbelievably cool. Like it it's proper like you know, back when he used to do amazing like metal gear cutscenes, it's it's that mode of Kojima. Like he really, really delivers.

Samuel
02:46:17
So you just gotta push through the very mournful and strange um and sad uh first game to see all this amazing shit. Um Which I'm not saying is like I'm not saying is bad by any means, but is it is definitely an acquired taste the first game.

Matthew
02:46:30
I and I d I just don't know what would happen if you dive straight into this one I just don't know if it would make any sense.

Samuel
02:46:36
Yeah, it's sort of like I w I will get to this eventually. You putting this this high, it's like a a proper statement. Um yeah, without a certain Nintendo game from this year would have been uh your number one, which is uh you know, it's high praise from you. And I don't think I don't think we talked about it since our first episode where we did discuss it, so It sounds like your relationship with it has only deepened since you first talked about it, you know?

Speaker 3
02:46:58
That's just but by the it it gets to a point where he's like

Matthew
02:47:03
You've proven that you can do all the navigation that I need you to do properly in this game. Like I know that you can climb any terrain. So let's start having some fun. Let's give you some really wacky gadgets. Or like, you've done enough combat now. Let's give you a giant cannon which just like rains down fucking demonic death on like an entire encampment. Like, he just he just goes for it. Um that's cool. Yeah.

Speaker 3
02:47:27
And it keeps going all the way up until the end, those like sort of breadcrumb trail of like madness. Yeah. Okay, well very good Matthew.

Samuel
02:47:35
Um okay so my number two then is split fiction. Um this is lower on your list, this is in the bottom half of your list, but I thought this was an exceptional co-op game from this year by Haze Light Studios. It is a game about uh two writers um one who writes uh generic uh sci-fi um with a bit of a cyberpunk tinge and the other who writes terrible fantasy I mean genuinely awful um Mio and Zoe Um they become trapped in their own stories after getting involved with this tech startup who are basically uh basically ran by a you one of your classic ghoul billionaire uh archetypes um who's harvesting people's ideas, trying to steal those. And um It's all but it's all predicated on the idea that like we'll bring your ideas to life and you can kind of enter them basically. That's how they get the the writers in the door. Um as if like ideas somehow are like really hard to get Um as opposed to like good execution of ideas, which would surely be the uh the thing you'd actually want to steal. Um but what it amounts to is basically uh A two-player co-op game in the It Takes Two Mold from 2021 where you are going through these different worlds, um, alternating between uh fantasy and sci-fi and just uh uh a mix of combat, uh platforming, um puzzles and um usually elements that involve multiple players um some of the best uh set piece design um outside of naughty dog um that I've ever seen in this game. Um really really impressive in the if you're into that kind of uh scripted 360 era uh set piece and we definitely have a soft spot for that at this podcast. Um this is a game that somehow makes designing those look effortless. And there are so many different ideas in this game. It's kind of unbelievable. It's almost like they basically just made Uh uh uh but basically just chose a premise that was so wide reaching they could do absolutely anything and have this real like game jam feel. um to all the different stuff you get up to in this, whether it's transforming it to different animals, um riding dragons, riding like vehicles through Tron style vehicles through sci-fi cityscapes. Um just really um I guess like uh to use Matthew Matthew's phrase describing Death Stranding 2 really goes for it. And even the offcuts of the game that really don't fit into the main story Um they have um have you uh go off and do them as side stories and so you get a little snippet of a a world that could have been or, you know, like a story that could have been and like one cool thing will occur there or one really strange thing might occur there. Quite a cursed one with far farm animals early on. There's another one with a big cake later on that's quite playful and cool. And there is, as um as discussed in last week's episode uh w uh like our favorite moment uh one of our favorite moments of the year in games, like our favorite set piece of the year where there is a sun that's going that is dying and it is pulsating and you are jumping between bits of cover. Um and that that feels properly sort of like Gears of War or uncharted coded. And it's um but and yet the execution is still so so good even though You know, they've never really done anything to this standard before this studio, but here they've really raised their game. And so I really believe that the the two player um split screen co-op experience is like an untapped market. I'm surprised more of them have not sprung up in the wake of it takes two. But they're gonna be tough title holders to um to unsee because this is really, really good. The only thing you can level at this game is the actual Story and writing is not that good. And yet somehow it doesn't matter because it it's all about that couch co-op experience, you sharing those moments with a friend or a partner. Thoughts Matthew?

Matthew
02:51:14
Maybe I should have put this high. I did I did really like this. I d I wonder if it just suffered a bit from being like uh early in the year that I'd sort of forgotten about it a little bit. When we were doing that last week's episode and we were talking about best moments and I was just looking through some of the side stories from this, it almost wasn't in my top ten and then that shunted it up there because I was like, well this has obviously gotta be in there because They do like a whole SSX clone just for like three minutes. Like they don't need to do that, but they do it anyway and committing to a card game It just lets them do so many more interesting things that than any game can do if it has to scale down to one player or up to more players like if it solves so many problems by just being like yes co-op only. I also something think something about the split screen and the amount of real estate you have to actually look at. means can do things at a slightly simpler visual level while still looking really really impressive. It's like everything is just good enough for the amount of time you actually get to scrutinize it 'cause it's so fast moving. It it really feels like they've worked out the formula for making loads of quite exciting, polished sort of AAA action adventure game. but doing it without like destroying their team, costing five hundred million dollars or taking ten years to do it. And that's like crazy that like That there's so much of this after it takes two, so close to it takes two.

Speaker 3
02:52:42
I just hope they never lose that that spirit.

Samuel
02:52:44
Yeah, it's like going for it but having the higher level execution as well. Um Uh yeah, like and you as you identify as you alluse to there, no naughty dog game this generation. I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being cross-gen intergalactic when that finally rolls around. A multiplayer Last of Us game that no one got to play or even see. I would love to have played a naughty dog game, um, either this year or last year, which feels like it should have been the time that one of those game came out c one of those games came out, but I mean, you know, it's co-op is a different paradigm, but like you say, they're i they're using they use the the idea of co-op so well in terms of what they visually present you and do such amazing things with it. I mean, what a great studio. Um I I yeah, I hope they just I I too just hope they kind of ask themselves, well, how can we go even further with it next time? Um because I do think that by the time their next game rolls around, there actually will be more games in this fame. Um we're finally starting to see a couple that look a little bit like it. So yeah. But that's exciting to me. It really people just want to play games on their couch with a friend and they want games to cost 40 quid. That's just Two fundamental truths about modern video games. So yeah, uh, what is your number one?

Matthew
02:53:55
My number one is Donkey Kong Bonanza. There it is. Which may come as a surprise. I don't know. I didn't so I will say I didn't think Donkey Kong Bonanza was gonna be my number one until something very specific happened, but I think the game that released on day one, I really love it. A gleeful ode to wanton destruction with beautiful technology, gorgeous looks. amazing feedback and uh sort of evolving powers that I think really sell you on that fantasy of smashing every level to bits. I think it raises some really interesting challenges for the what is traditionally the 3D Mario team? Like how do you build level design when your character's core mechanic is he destroys levels and basically shrugs off anything you have planned for him and I think the game is successful like 80% of the time. I think there's definitely bits of that game where where it's still trying to find its feet and I think it resorts to some collectathon tropes a a little too much. Like the end game of it I don't think is like hugely exciting going around collecting loads and loads of fossils just by smashing levels into basically dust. Um but I think when it does work out how to make more of a challenge from an environment that can be fully destroyed, like when it adds more dangers and threats and where land suddenly becomes very precious and you know is the thing that's keeping you alive suddenly having this character who can destroy everything becomes a bit of a liability and I think there's some interesting tensions there I think there's some wild visual invention to this game and I gave it four stars in my Guardian review, which is why I maybe wasn't thinking of it for n for number one. But what has happened since then is th the release of the the DLC Emerald Rush. Now I know this is slightly cheating. because the core game doesn't have the DLC. I wish it did. I think it's really really dumb that it doesn't. I think at the very least Nintendo should add Emerald Rush to the Nintendo Switch Online subscription like they did with the Splatoon DLC. So if you have the core game you get this as a freebie because I think it is a quietly extraordinary mode in terms of unlocking the full potential of that character in his moveset and actually making a game type that makes maybe more sense for him than anything in the single player game. Emerald Rush, if you haven't played it, is a roguelite mode, so despite up top saying I was sick of them, um I have uh Because I'm a hit terrible hypocrite. I have allowed this Nintendo one through. You basically have to smash emeralds for Void Kong. You get um ninety seconds um to to s smash up at emeralds and then in the next round he'll want more emeralds. The kind of hook of it is that you start the game with a core Donkey Kong as he is at the start of the game, like your entire skill trees locked off and so as you're exploring the map looking for these emerald crystals you're also collecting his powers which are hidden around the map You're hitting fossils which give you certain buffs. Ums can stack in some crazy ways. You can complete these little missions that Void Kong will drop into the map, so like kill these four enemies or go and high-five the the parrot squawks or whatever and uh as you do those you're earning more powers you're also getting chips which you can then go into your skill tree and buy your powers back. So over the course of these contained rounds, you're getting more and more powerful, which in theory should let you get further afield and reach the emerald crystals you haven't reached. So it's it's almost like the power curve of the whole game playing out in the course of one game of Emerald Rush. What I like about it is it still has the what really does work about roguelites, which is, you know, the buffs it starts serving you and the powers you happen to unlock. they begin to sort of steer your thinking, you know, like, oh this is gonna be a great round where, you know, we multiply all the emeralds I collect from gems, so I'm gonna really focus on that or This is around where the mission Void Kong gives me suddenly have crazy high rewards, so let's focus on that. And uh, you know, or maybe the bonanza power you unlock. Like if you get one bonanza power or you get the bonanza special attacks with it, which are like the transformations. You know, that may change your thinking. You're like Well, I'm I'm the zebra Donkey Kong for this one, so I can run really fast and that's gonna change how I maybe think about this map, and I just thought it made you think about Donkey Kong, his relation to the landscape, his moves, the damage you can do, how you make shortcuts by powering through those landscapes. All of that makes so much more sense when you're r racing for these emeralds and it's almost like if you told me they made the core game so they could make this game. I I d I you know I wouldn't question it at all. You're like, oh yeah, this is the natural conclusion to to what is happening in the main game and You know, that isn't to diminish the main game. I still think it's like a tremendous time and you know, probably the thing that you'll just play and enjoy and and that's it, full stop. But It this is the icing on the cake that for me knocked it up above type help and and death stranding too into the top spot. So and it quite a recent development, but I'm absolutely hooked on this mode. Ah you know what, I like

Samuel
02:59:27
I don't like contest the pick, but the fact that it is paid DLC that gets it the top spot. Ah, like it's that is a slight bummer. Like it I know I know like to it completes the experience for you, but it is almost like it couldn't do it alone with what they gave you on day one.

Matthew
02:59:45
Um which is but I I can't go I can't go back from it now.

Samuel
02:59:49
Yeah, but I don't know. I don't know if you would you have allowed this from like another from like a Sony game if it was like a paid DLC or like I feel like you've made a special provision. Yeah, of course I would if it had a meaningful

Matthew
03:00:01
Yeah.

Speaker 3
03:00:01
Yeah, I guess I I I yeah I just couldn't see you tolerating this from a non-Nintendo game.

Matthew
03:00:11
Right. Like simply for the sake of like I need something that that that shapes this a little bit. And that's that's I that reflects where I'm currently at with these games.

Speaker 3
03:00:22
Fair enough. I am being a bit um No, no, that's fine.

Matthew
03:00:26
I wanted to ask I wanted to ask the question.

Speaker 3
03:00:27
That's all.

Matthew
03:00:28
No, I I wish it I wish it wasn't. Uh I sort of I can sort of understand why it isn't it's maybe not like a universal experience or it's such a pitch to like a core sensibility. You know, like You've mastered all this, but you want a little bit more. Well here it is. You know, I can understand not wanting to put all that work into something which is just gonna maybe sit at the end of the game which Is everyone gonna complete that core game to actually reach it? Who knows? So I do get it. It is messy. I apologize for that. Well it's 13 quid on Shop 2. I ignored it on launch, the the Emerald Rush thing. I only really tried it on a whim like a few weeks ago. Um, but I've just been playing loads of it basically in downtime and Uh I think about it loads. It's really got its claws into me and it put some stuff into context which maybe didn't make complete sense for me, like just in Donkey Kong Bonanza alone. Um like some of the ideas, like some of the costumes, the stat booths, all that, the almost like the light RPG elements. I was like, I don't really know what you're going what you're going for with this. Like none of this game feels tailored to that, but it does feel tailored to this. Maybe that's a flaw of the core game and I should ding it because of that, but Well come on. It's my only Nintendo game in my top ten. That is that is fair.

Samuel
03:01:51
I will say that I've not played this DLC and I considered making this my number one um early this week any regardless um based on the core game. I gave this this is my number three And I think it is a game that the the core game there is that really lives or dies based on the world that you're on. When it delights, it is Nintendo at its very best. When it when it feels like the the transformations that you unlock when they suit the st what the the style of world they've built and the ways in which you uncover its secrets or the ways in which you interact with the land mass. Like um when those things line up, it is absolute magic. But it is a it is a very broad canvas of a game as you kind of allude there. Like it's hard to work out exactly what they're going for all the time. But there's just so much so much that delighted me about this, the fundamental smashing through things, feeling of it, the fact that terrain deformation's at the heart of a game when so few games have ever really done that meaningfully. I mean we talked about Red Faction Gorilla when we discussed this game originally, but you know, it's a kind of a mystery why games haven't experimented with this more. I guess that's probably because it is quite hard to figure out what the rest of the game is exactly. Um however I just think it's for the for a a near launch title of the Switch 2, not quite like a month after launch, it was exactly what I kind of wanted. To see from Nintendo. It was something you could not do on the Switch. It was something that needs the technical grunt. And it was like a bold new take on a on a familiar character with new ideas and loads of game for your money. It's a very long game. Um I actually think you should play this. Like kids would play N64 games in the 90s and chip away at it over the course of like six to twelve months. Um I think that's the optimal way to play it. I don't actually think that It should be churned through by 30 something men for the purposes of making podcasts. I think it should be in enjoyed in in bits and pieces. I think it's a game that's designed to be consumed like playing a Mario 64 or or or um Banjo Kazooie or Donkey Kong 64. I think it's meant to be played in that way, um, is my personal take. I think if you have children in your life they'll be delighted by it because those core interactions are so much fun. Um and I believe that a sequel to this game could easily be a nine out or ten out of ten. I see New ideas, and I see loads of potential for those ideas. And there's the the resort layer that you go to in this game, which is basically like have a little holiday between the levels. Absolutely delightful, just a series of like beachy islands, really. It looks like a level from Marrow Galaxy, honestly. And then you get this um liftoff ore. Where you basically um you you you pick it up, this kind of like rainbow-colored rock, and you chuck it and it forms a physical ramp in front of you. And then You just make so much use of this one mechanic building all these interconnected ramps to climb this really kind of like vertical level. And every time you see that, it it it gives you that fucking old barson and ratatouille moment of I didn't think a game could make me feel this way again. And I would say there are multiple moments like that throughout this game, but if The first time you get the like elephant transformation and start hoovering up all of the different you just start pulling bits of earth like into Donkey Kong um with this like m enormous vacuum. So so good. And so Yeah, even though I don't think it's like a c a particularly consistent game because of just how not all of the powers are that interesting, not all of the levels are that interesting. Um, you know, there are definitely like 10 out of 10 moments in this game, and I think it's a really special thing and a great reason to own a Nintendo Switch 2. Like I honestly think that by itself it's a great reason to own a Nintendo Switch 2. So That's my take on it, Matthew. I didn't mean to um sound like it was raining on your parade.

Matthew
03:05:41
No, not at all. No, I uh hey I'm I'm glad you enjoyed it and also went to bat for it.

Samuel
03:05:46
Yeah, well I mean what a cool game man. So um Yeah, I'd love to see what they do what they do next with this. Could be a few years, I guess. Well, um well Mario is presumably next in line, but um Yeah, and I would consider giving that DLC a go. It's like thirteen quid on Shop Two. And um I'd like to see if it captures my imagination or something. Yeah, it is it is a bummer. I know I know it is. Well one one good thing that's happened is I've noticed that Amazon has started dropping Switch 2 game prices. So while I think this was 63 quid for me at launch, you can now get this for like 50 quid pretty much on the dot. Um Which is su I think like a well worth it for that. And so if you chuck the DLC in, you're basically paying what I paid at launch, plus you get the complete experience. That's not so bad. So um Yes, Matthew. Um a worthy number one, and it makes sense that this would be your number one. I did expect this would be your number one, so um yes. Okay. My number one then is I'm afraid it's a very conventional choice this year. It's Claire Obscure Expedition thirty three. It was the game that was closest to no it and split fiction were both like probably nines for me, but Donkey Kong Bonanza was kind of like a borderline eight or nine. And I suppose I just thought that Claire Obscure maybe just did something I hadn't seen. Uh, how best to explain this? Because people know what the fucking deal with this game is by now. It is the breakout game of the year. It does the Japanese RPG in visually extraordinary fashion, both in terms of the art direction and it being a very shiny unreal engine game despite the small team that made it, yada yada yada. Everyone's heard that discourse and it's boring as shit at this point. But If you take away all of the real-world discussion and you think about the game in a vacuum, I think it you can start to tap back into what is so special about it. It's been so over-discussed this year. But it is like Uh what I love about it is I see like millennial tastes in like from game designers in this game. Like I see people who Not only the very you know the inspiration of like Final Fantasy X is very obvious, but I also see inspiration from Final Fantasy XIII in this game. It's people who have I think familiar experiences, if you like if you're a sort of someone who was born in the late 80s or early 90s and played Final Fantasy games, you feel like it's people who understand what it is you liked about those games tapping into it and sometimes tapping into the bits that are like that were that were less well liked. Um it's not like a a free form open world game. It's mostly like linear environments. I think it's much closer to Final Fantasy XIII than peop than Many people have really identified.

Matthew
03:08:26
Yeah.

Samuel
03:08:26
Um and I find that really intriguing about the game. But the confidence with which they layer on this Bellapoque, um very French art direction on top of that. And this very sad story of um a a painteress counting down um the lives of all the the humans that live in this land and the fact that like eventually they'll they will all be gone. And um there are a lot of kind of like young parents in this world with this anxiety of sending out these expeditions and just hoping this is the one that finally stops the painteress and stops people from disappearing in this very kind of like sad uh ritual that plays out um once a year. Um I think that that Context is just s is is so original and so bold, and they really commit to it. I think something this game does that's key to its success is that it is meta In a sincere way. It's a and that's a kind of storytelling I haven't seen in games so much. The meta-text, without going too much into spoilers, is part of the text of the game. They're intrinsically linked. And it's hinted at from very early in the story. There are moments where um it pauses and the character um Mael um uh sees that everyone around her is frozen but that there that there are other characters who she can interact with, um, that only s uh only she can see. And so you understand that there is more to this story than meets the eye. And what that is, is is is peeled back in this very bold way that will work for some players and not work for others. Um but it is almost like the the game has this kind of like layer of of self-awareness, but like the the meta layer and like the actual text are just sort of like welded together in this way I've just not quite seen before in an RPG. And I thought that was really well done, but it still doesn't really it doesn't undermine what the text of the game actually is. That's without spoiling it, what I think the storytelling achievement of the game is. Um And the characters are good, the voice acting is is solid. Um and the combat is r it is great. It is turn-based, but it does have the old um Mario RPG um or whatever uh your kind of touchstone for that kind of like QT-based interaction is. um at at its core and then it has like pretty simple progression outside of that. But it's got as well as having like a great main quest, it's got loads of great optional content. It has a very PS1 feeling Final Fantasy, um not open world exactly, but sort of like world map hub um to sort of explore and optional bosses are incredibly hard. And just demonstrates that they understand all of the things that made um Final Fantasy special. And I will say to you that um do your best to experience this in a vacuum. Don't read too much about what people are saying about it. Don't look too much at fan art. I said this before, but I really mean it. Like This is a game that I think would be it should be experienced in a memless world. You should be able to play it like it's 2002. Like it's me playing Final Fantasy X on my TV video combi. And I cannot I have to go on a weird forum to read what people think of this game and any kind of insight on this game. But instead instead you get it yelled at you on Blue Sky and Tumblr. And like I say that I say that only dilutes what the game is. I say This game is really special and amazing and like I think it's best to uncouple it from all of the real-world discussion because what they have made is amazing, even if it You know, it's it's become a very universal experience this year. Long-winded way of saying good RPG, Matthew, good Japanese RPG. They did a good job. Thoughts?

Matthew
03:11:58
Yeah, I mean, you'll you'll notice it isn't in my top ten. Um I I I just uh to be honest, I I I dropped off playing this um a couple of hours into act two. And it was so long ago now I almost struggle to remember why why I did but So appalled by the gesturals you were. Yeah, it was just all pure gestural hate. Um No, I think I I think there were just other things going on that I wanted to play or or do. I can s sort of see exactly where you're coming from and I th I th You know, I think what this draws inspiration from you having and so many others having such fondness and love for it uh I think definitely explains, you know, why this game feels so special to so many people. I would say I don't have that relationship with those things. that that it is drawing from necessarily. Um which I think is is part of why I thought this was good rather than very special or important to me personally. The story's the thing I'm like least into, the story and characters. Uh 'cause I think I've I just found it a little bit a little bit kind of angsty. Uh No, not that, just sort of teenager feeling and a bit sort of too melancholic and sort of drab. I don't know, I just it it it didn't it didn't gr it didn't grab me, but I am definitely in the minority on this, the way people have taken these characters to heart and like the love for them online and the love for the actors playing them like It it's it's it's it's just a thing where you're like, you know, good for them, you know, and good for everyone else uh enjoying this and having fun. I think that the The part of this game where I am in like complete agreement with everyone, I think the combat system is is like a sensationally good take on the on the Mario Paper Mario thing, which actually you know, I think we increasingly see the limitations of like the Paper Mario and Marion Luigi RPG and I I think they're the all the s the sort of gump they layer on here is entirely necessary to spice up what is like fundamentally quite a flawed system full of repetition. But here, like, the fact that every character has their own basically their own combat system mechanics for you to master and within that are incredibly malleable based on what upgrades you plug into them and the fact that they seem happy for you to just break that combat system, like crack it wide open. Like if you can work out the right combination of powers. that are gonna let you break it and do crazy damage from the outset. That's fine. Like well done you for working it out and I I love that sense of experimentation. So You know, that I was always really impressed with. I I will go back and finish it. I just, you know, I almost feel like I can't weigh in on it because I haven't seen it all the way through to the end. This isn't me just being like sour grapes party pooper. Um I I I j I just genuinely stepped away from it for for reasons I can't really re recall I feel like the explosion of love for this came slightly after reviews. I remember there being some more modest reviews at launch. Piece of gamer. And then it became this, oh, it's gonna be this year's Borders Gate or ten out of ten. So I feel like there I feel like there are people like me out there who maybe had a a more you know, modest enjoyment of it, but we feel like uh very curmudgeonly in light of it being Claire Obscures Year, you know, that doesn't fit the narrative to only like this game rather than love it. But so it goes.

Samuel
03:15:32
But I think this is a classic Japanese RPG thing where the audience for those games has always been like mega passionate and pretty substantial. But um I think that the it's a bit I think it's a bit of a circle in the Venn diagram. Like I don't think it has much crossover with people like other types of games. Like it's a little bit off by its itself, I think, the Japanese RPG. Um and I don't just mean that in the sense of like the gameplay mechanics, like the idea of term-based gameplay mechanics. I think they can have broader appeal. But it's the very specific thing you you mentioned, like the melancholy, the m like the melodrama more generally, like the the tone of these games and the stories and the characters. Like they are like designed to be loved, but then I think that if you don't lock into that They either seem perplexing or Maven seemed like slightly repellent. And so they've always but they've always been a bit like that. There's always been people who look at The Cloud's spiky hair and his big sword and think what the fuck is that? And that's just like and that's completely fair. If it's not for you, that's okay. And you know, I but I always found that to be the case. Like I had my friends who liked Pro Evo, Halo, um FIFA, GTA. And that's me. That's me. But those same kids those same kids never fucking liked Final Fantasy. Whenever I talked about it, they were a bit like I don't really get what this game's deal is. Why are they playing football underwater and all this stuff? And like that's just the Japanese RPG. It's designed to be loved by a subset of people, but they are never like the biggest games in the world. This has happens to be like a mega breakout. I think it being like a Game Pass game was probably a big part of that too. I think it meant that like it got it reached so many people so quickly. as a result of that. And um yeah, and plus it's another forty quid game. People people like forty quid games, you know? It's just I do. That was just well judged. So Yeah, um I don't think there's any y yeah, this this I d it don't surprise me remotely that you don't have it on your list, and I think that's fair enough. And there are plenty of people who will celebrate it, but in a very honest assessment of the games I thought were the year's best This was my number one. So um even though I I totally acknowledge it is not a very exciting pick because of how much acclaim it's had. It was, yeah, it was a a great experience. It gave me, it was a proper like meat-on-the-bone Japanese RPG. It wasn't superficially doing the Japanese RPG thing. It did everything. That Final Fantasy has always done and to a very high standard. So yeah, there it is, Matthew. Okay, shall we read out our top tens, Matthew, as we wrap up? And uh just remind people of what we had.

Matthew
03:18:07
Yeah, let's do it.

Samuel
03:18:08
What's your number ten? Clues by Sam. Mine was uh Shin Shinobi Art of Vengeance. What's your number nine?

Matthew
03:18:16
Lumines arise. Mine was Rematch. What's your number eight? Split fiction. Dispatch. What's your number seven? The seance of Blake Manor. Avowed. What's your number six? The root trees are dead. Promise Mascot Agency. What's your number five? Promise Mascot Agency. Mine was uh Blue Prince, um which I selected alone and had to talk about. What's your number four, Matthew? The 100 line, Last Defense Academy. Arc Raiders, what's your number three? Type help. Donkey Kong Bonanza, what's your number two? Death Stranding 2 on the Beach. Split fiction. And what's your number one? Donkey Kong Bonanza featuring Emerald Rush DLC.

Samuel
03:19:03
And uh mine was Claire Obscure Expedition 33. Those are the top tens Matthew, and uh as we reach the three and a half hour mark, I mean I think we really uh we were really comprehensive about our year and uh pretty happy with how the pod turned out.

Matthew
03:19:17
So um That was a good chat. No no upsets, no major upsets. No, not really. It was quite a predictable year in some ways.

Samuel
03:19:26
It was more interesting to hear what hadn't made your list and uh than what had. So um Yeah, it was uh that was fun from my perspective. I always enjoyed it.

Matthew
03:19:34
I was gonna say uh up until about three days ago, baby steps was also on the list, but uh playing it before this episode made me so cross that I cut it out in an act of childishness.

Samuel
03:19:45
Well you had a similar experience to me then. I mean it was really funny because I went to for reasons I won't go into, I went to Matthew's house briefly this morning. And um he just told me, uh yeah, last night we uh we in baby steps, like we had tried to get some car keys and uh it went wrong and then we went to bed in a mood and uh now it's not in my top ten and I Found that very funny. I thought about that most time.

Matthew
03:20:06
We got some keys. We had to deliver them to a watchtower. We got them out of the difficult cabin where they were found. We got them all the way over to the watchtower. And then Catherine fell over and they fell out of his hand. We think into a river. We never find the keys again. And it's like, well that's just that. You just they never spawn again.

Speaker 3
03:20:23
Yep, so uh, you know, it's uh certainly uh a bit of a

Samuel
03:20:28
Uh uh also a singular game from this year, but an acquired taste and I don't know. I don't ri don't know if I have the temperament for it.

Matthew
03:20:35
I think that's what they'd want. I think they'd want you to kick it out of the top ten in a rage and then come back to it later and feel a bit sheepish about it.

Samuel
03:20:41
Yeah, at least we got like one really good uh Simpsons meme out of it in our blue sky that blue sky post message. That was good. Okay. The podcast is done.
