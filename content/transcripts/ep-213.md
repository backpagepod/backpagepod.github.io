Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew, how's it going? I can't remember what we talked about in the last intro to the podcast. Oh yes, it was sandwiches.
So we covered that. Has anything happened to you over the weekend since we last spoke? Eventful weekend at all?
No, not at all. I've played some games that we'll be talking about in this episode, and Catherine was playing some games for review, so we had a very antisocial weekend. Her upstairs, me downstairs.
Perfect.
I drank some diet cokes.
I was wondering if you were feeling the tiny bit of sort of January doldrums, because I mean, I guess by the time this goes live, January is finally almost over, but I don't remember the last time a January felt this endless. I think maybe it's the lack of new games in the midst of it that's made it feel, not that there's been like no new games, there's been a few, but it's just, it's a proper old school January month for games, isn't it?
Yeah, that's probably fair, and I feel like we've been waiting for some films to come out as well, so, yeah, I've been kind of twiddling my thumbs watching the traitors. January is now defined by the traitors for me every year, and then applying and trying to get on the traitors and failing every year, so that's actually kind of eaten up a lot of my headspace, because I'm an idiot.
Nice, I watched Snowpiercer at the weekend, and that was my stimulation. So on the Patreon in March, we're going to do a Bong Joon Ho Films ranked episode. So making a head start on that one.
I've brought a Blu-ray box set of all the other ones, Matthew. So I'll be getting into that over the next few days. But yes.
You're going to become a big old bong head.
Indeed, that is the correct term for that person. So, okay, we have a What We've Been Playing episode, our first of the year. Always use these to kind of chart what we're playing across the year, and then it kind of...
This is like the groundwork towards the 11 months from now Game of the Year episode, isn't it, Matthew? This is the preparation phase. Is that how these episodes, is that how you see these episodes?
Yeah, just about like ticking off some of those positions, trying to, you know, the more you can start filling that top 10 in this part of the year, just the better the year goes. I think a lot of good stuff is released now. Like Spring has become sort of unexpectedly rich.
It used to be absolutely death on the magazines. But now I kind of feel like this is when all the 100-hour Japanese games come out. And so I play those and I'm quite happy.
Yeah, I mean, I am the same. I'm kind of waiting for Monster Hunter to hit. And then that will be my big game for February and probably March as well.
So that suits me just fine. But yeah, I don't mind these slightly quieter months. We've got a few things to talk about here.
I'm going to kick us off, Matthew, with Dynasty Warriors Origins, the latest in the long-running series, going all the way back to the PS1 from Tecmo Koei. It is a game, well, it's a series of battering hundreds and hundreds of men with like super-powered historical figures from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms book slash actual history. And this game is something of a reset of the series.
Dynasty Warriors 9 was not very well regarded, as I recall, Matthew. It was a bit buggy and well, quite buggy and didn't get particularly glowing reviews. Yet the formula has arguably never had a better sort of history or recent history or, you know, sort of like set of years as the last five years, as it's popped up in sort of Persona 5 and Zelda shaped sort of skins.
The Musou Warriors formula, however you'd describe it, has never been bigger. So, you know, it's arguably hit more people than it ever has before, but it's been a while since they've revisited the main series that kicked it all off. And here we are with a game that kind of resets the entire story, places you in the shoes of a Japanese RPG style mute protagonist with amnesia, classic sort of tropey set up, but puts you into contact with the three different kingdoms who will eventually vie for power in China.
And then you navigate the relationships with these different factions over the course of the story until it adds up to, I don't think it's the spoiling anything to say, you choosing which faction you back, which of the three kingdoms you back to essentially rule. And then the game splinters off into different paths based on that. So very ambitiously drawn way to sort of revisit this series.
At the same time, I didn't actually play Dynasty Warriors 9, so I don't know to what extent it's been iterated on and how many of these different innovations popped up in the different Warriors games over the years, Matthew. But it feels freshened up by a slightly different combat system. The battlefield is shaped much more by this morale meter than it was before.
That was always in the game, but now it really is kind of life and death in this quite profound way. And I would say there's generally a higher level of polish than I really associate with these games at the same time. It still has the rough edges and slightly budget feel in places that I also associate with this series.
And it also I think arguably makes it quite endearing as well as a proposition. Dynasty Warriors has never really been the most blockbuster of blockbuster series. But I was curious where you've landed with it Matthew and how you found it so far.
Yeah, so I've been really impressed by this actually. And it's kind of the perfect Dynasty Warriors for someone with my level of experience, which is having dipped into like weird ones here and there. I've probably got the most experience with the two Zelda versions of this they did, which I think definitely put the series and its mechanics on people's radar.
So a lot of people are kind of approaching this with a better sense of how it works. But I find the creation of this protagonist character who sits outside of history but in a kind of shadowy position, like without getting too much into their story, you know, they kind of suggest that there are sort of hidden puppet masters helping leaders throughout history, which is why you've never heard of this bloke you're playing as, but why he can bear all these key moments in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. But I think that really works for me, because I don't have a good grasp of the period, you know, from what I have played of different games based in that period, I haven't picked up enough of the history, I know some of the names, but I couldn't tell you, you know, who the quote unquote goodies and baddies are.
So having like this random guy walk in and everyone have to explain themselves to him, you know, in a more kind of like sort of JRPG manner, that really works for me, you know. I finally kind of understand the flow of what's going on, what the stakes are. I actually haven't got to the point here, it breaks into the different paths.
I don't know how far you are with this.
I'm up to the end of Chapter 2, beginning of Chapter 3, which is where it happens basically.
Right, okay. Yeah, I think I'm nearing the end of Chapter 2, with the incredibly unsubtle, is it Zong Dao, like the big fat purple bastard?
I mean, what a great villain. I mean, I too am impressed by this game, right? And it's funny, because when it started, I thought, oh, these cutscenes are interminable.
There are so many of them. There's so much flab between the big battles, which define the Dynasty Warriors series as well. Like you have these, what you would, I guess, like describe as their version of sort of random battles, right, little encounters that pop up in the map.
You go up to them. You take part, usually they ask for like two or three minutes. You kill a sort of general or two, then kind of move on with things, or an officer or two, then move on with things.
And then there are characters to interact with across this world map, a very kind of Japanese RPG style world map. And then sort of the game is then defined by about sort of like eight or so big battles per chapter. That tends to be how it breaks down with a lot of cutscenes in between.
And at first, I sort of bristled at that approach. I thought, oh, this is so flabby before it gets to battles. And then I think the where about where you are now around chapter two, I think the writing actually started to click for me a bit more.
And I thought, oh, there's a little bit more going on under the hood here than I thought there was. Because in some ways, I don't give you loads of context for what's actually going on or what different factions are doing or what's actually happening in China when you pick up. You just know there is corruption.
There is this emperor who is sort of like being advised by all these like 10 eunuch bastards who have to do it. Which I found fascinating, they were eunuchs. In fact, when I went and read up on those guys, that actually made me understand the story a little bit more.
I was like, oh, that's who these guys are. But they're basically just advisors who have been sort of like sticking their hand in the kitty, as it were, to just sort of like live a good life off the back of starving Chinese civilians, basically. That's sort of the set up.
And then there's the emperor dies, and then there's a vacuum that forms, and then, yeah, Dong Zhuo, he's the fat bastard who sort of steps in and takes power for himself. But I actually thought so. I think some of the writing is actually really good in this.
And even the voice acting is mostly flat. It's in place. It's pretty good.
And every now and then it has a little bit of that.
Do you play in Japanese or English?
English. Maybe that's a different experience. I don't know, but.
I'm doing my usual Japanese things. I'm an idiot.
That sums us up, though, doesn't it? The difference between the two of us. But yeah, and every now and then it just gets a bit closer to that Game of Thrones style sort of like political drama you actually want, you know?
Yeah, I absolutely get that. And I think the thing it does really well and makes perfect sense given how the battles work. So in the battles, you've got like thousands of people on the battlefield, but really it is decided by what goes down between the leaders of those thousands of people, you know, like you basically fight the commander who's a generic person or is a, you know, famous historical warrior or general or whatever.
And so then having this sort of downtime in between battles where you get to spend time with those people and talk to them and get to meet them, it gives a lot of context for the people you are meeting in battle. And you know, due to the nature of the story, people you fight alongside in one battle, will become adversaries later. And I imagine that will only get more complicated once you've actually allied with one of the three sides.
So I think that the decision to like really punch up those characters in between missions, almost with this like sort of social, it's not like persona friendship per se, it's a bit softer than that, but you can chat to people and get little missions from them. And you get like little sort of, not romance, but like friendship scenes, I guess, where you hang out with them. And they are so integral to the missions themselves, that I thought that that decision made perfect sense.
You know, like beforehand, in the ones that I have played, I've always felt like you've just had to have a natural grip on who's important. So when someone enters the battlefield, you're meant to be like, oh shit, it's that guy. And this time you actually have a sense of who they are, because you've gone to the pub or like, you know, eaten some fricking ham with them or whatever.
You know, the scenes are largely kind of like Tavern based so far for me. But that works really well. That seems like a good thing to double down on.
Yeah, I agree. It's funny because it's treating all of these real life historical figures like they're Marvel superheroes. They're almost like the friendships in Marvel Midnight Suns, where there's a bit of rudimentary relationship building that goes on when you do tasks for them.
But the actual interaction is designed, you can't romance them as such, but they are designed to be your pals. The fantasy is, isn't it cool that all these historical figures are your pals? And so the game doubles down on that.
And at the same time, just yeah, manages to inject a little bit of conflict into it. So I watched quite a good cut scene last night where one character talks about basically a terrible thing he did and now he sort of raises this girl he took from all these people that he killed and stuff. And this is someone who is introduced as quite a gentle character, so it takes you by surprise a little bit.
And it's, you know, I assume there's some kind of historical basis for this. If not, I'm sure Romance of Three Kingdoms provides some basis for it. But yeah, I agree.
It's context you never got in those games, which I would say that the characters in the previous Dynasty Warriors games and the difference is in this game, you just control the one character and occasionally swap in one of your friends, you know, one of these different heroes as your friends to play as in battle. You know, and in the other games you played as any of the characters you wanted. So there's a bit of a compromise there, arguably.
It's that those characters are basically just memes to me. Like Guan Yu, that guy was a meme to me. I was like, oh yeah, I like Guan Yu.
And it's like, I know nothing about Guan Yu. I just thought his barks in Dynasty Warriors 3 were really funny because the voice acting was jank as fuck because it was the PS2 era. And it's funny to come back to this years later where I haven't, I don't think the last one I played was a Samurai Warriors game on 360.
So not the same series or setting, but like it was a relative of the series. And to come back to it, it's actually what I found it quite cool to revisit some of these things, but they're recontextualized. So have you got to the bit where a certain character is revealed?
Yeah, I was going to ask you about that because it really, really made me laugh that the particular mission they were introduced in, they served the role of our beloved Mr. X. Just an unstoppable force.
So I mean, I thought that was brilliant. And in general, I think that the main mission design in this is of such a high standard compared to the early Dynasty Warriors games. So it's a proper sort of like ebb and flow of battle.
And you know, and a variety of objectives like this, the one mission we were describing there was basically an assassination that doesn't quite go to plan. I don't think it's okay to say that. But, and so it's, so the scale is slightly smaller, but they, so they find all these different ways to kind of keep it varied.
But when it comes to the big battles, they deliver the drama and the push and pull that you really want. There's a proper sort of like going around the battlefield, helping pals, sort of getting their health back up and capturing bases to raise morale. And then this very gradual feeling of like coming back from, you know, unbeatable odds to finally win.
And like it's, I think it, that is what I think it does better than anything else. But that combined with all the niceties around the outside has made this a better experience than I was expecting, you know?
Yeah, I think the thing I really like about it is that it has all the scale and shape that you might recognize from any of these Musou games, you know, in terms of the battlefield is full of people and you're battling your way through. You feel as this new protagonist character maybe a little bit more like a traditional 3D action game hero. Like, you have all the broad moves which you would expect from Dynasty Warriors where you're sweeping away 50 guys at a time.
But when you lock in to the fights with the people who matter, the commanders and the name characters, you know, there's a little bit more focus on parrying and dodging and using certain moves to counter their special moves. It feels a little bit more like a duel. And in the middle of the battlefield, that's really exciting.
But it also allows them to occasionally do, well, basically, boss fights, I guess, where it becomes, you know, they look kind of like, you know, a Platinum game boss fight or whatever. There's like weird attack patterns you have to learn and like big superhero shit going off. Like the end of, the one at the end of chapter one, like you're fighting a guy in an arena with always like tornadoes around it.
And it doesn't feel at all like my memory of Dynasty Warriors. Now, if that stuff is in there, that's just because I haven't played enough of them. But it feels like they can do everything you want in terms of the more general battlefield stuff, but can also like zoom right in for a very cinematic clash.
And then in the course of that cinematic clash, kind of zoom back out again and have all your mates arrive. And you're like, fuck yeah. And it becomes a Dynasty Warriors battle halfway through a boss fight.
And that stuff's really, really exciting. That's just a great use of almost like two skill sets. Team, you know, Team Ninja and the Megaforce and all that lot have.
Yeah, I agree with that. I think that the key thing this combat system has versus again what I remember of the Dynasty Warriors games is that you, it's got that very contemporary parry dodge element where you can, well, there's an ability you can sort of unlock that allows you to regain sort of like special move points when you do a perfect dodge. So that's one thing, but from the start, you can tap L1 on the PS5 pad and block an attack and then do a powerful counter.
And so it has at its core quite good fighting, but that's not nearly as precise or demanding as more recent sort of Souls-likey games have been, you know, by design. And so, yeah, I can't, I think the mix of elements is just right. And it's that thing where I went into this with like, I was sort of excited about this for this to be a guilty pleasure, but now I've been playing it for about 23 hours or something.
I'm there debating, am I actually going to finish this? Am I actually going to go all the way? Cause I am engaged enough by this.
And there's a lot of junky characters who I don't care about. Just sort of like, you know, like your various Shu and Wei guys are like, all right. And you're like, yeah, okay, fine.
They have no particularly distinguishing characteristics, but you know, my guy is Guan Yu and the main green dude, I can't remember his name. What's his name? I can't remember which is it?
Is he huge, Liang? Is that him?
There's another, there's like, there's so many like, there's like Lu Bu and then there's like Lu Bei. And yeah, and other people are like this. The green guy's got like two big dudes with him, that guy.
Yeah, yeah. And like you meet him at the start and they're a bit like sort of the shabby, shabby lads who are like, oh, you know, but we're sort of like, we're just sort of up and comers, really. But no one takes us seriously.
But aren't we, you know, we're sort of, we're nice guys or whatever. I can't remember the name of the main green dude now. It's much to my shame.
But Guan Yu's mates, basically. Guan Yu's boss and Guan Yu's various pals. Yeah, it's nicely done.
So there's a bit too much filler in there. And I do also think that if you don't understand what this series is, I do wonder if it's still maybe a bit of a, you need to at least have a fundamental understanding and liking of this in order to firmly recommend it. What do you think?
I feel like having played the Zelda ones, they used all the Zelda dressing to kind of teach me to play these games. And I understand the flow of them and what's important in battle now, as opposed to, I remember reviewing, definitely like a Samurai Warriors back in the day on NGamer and really struggling with where exactly my attention is meant to go. Because when you're on the battlefield, they say, here's the objective, get here and defeat this guy, this is how we win.
But as the fight's going on, reinforcements are coming in at scripted moments and they may come in and take the first territory you claimed right at the start of the level, all the way back on the other side of the map and you're like, well, do I need to go back and get that? It's amazingly how fast any weakness you allow and anyone you ignore, any situation you ignore can escalate into a fight ending moment. When losses come in this genre generally, but specifically in this game, they come for you so quickly and it's quite frustrating to lose a fight when you've been doing really well for 25 minutes, but just the one mistake you made.
And I wouldn't say it's a strategic mistake. It's just having that built-in knowledge of the game is actually telling you to turn around, go back to the start and deal with that. That's a key lesson.
But one thing I will say that really helps, and I don't know if this is new for this one, but when you do fail, you can rewind the battle and start it at different points. So you can basically rewind to the last point you felt pretty confident how you were doing, and you're like, oh, I remember this is where it went south because this fucker turned up and I ignored him. And then you can jump in then and kick it off and try and correct your mistakes.
That I really like. That is just a great quality of life thing. And Fix is probably my main problem with the series, which is sometimes you're just like, where did it all go wrong?
I have no idea.
Yeah, they give you this big interactive map that shows you where everyone went at different times. I think that was always in the series. But here it's like you can go back and forth to figure out exactly where different characters were when.
I realized they got fucked by a difficulty spike, because if you take a companion into battle, I think it adds some kind of weird multiplier to the morale where morale drops faster or allied characters drop faster or something like that. I read that on Steam. And then as soon as I stopped bringing side characters into it, that really helped.
The other key thing was that in a big battle, I kept losing over and over again, to the point where it became like fucking Edge of Tomorrow, trying to figure out what the fuck I was doing wrong. It was actually because I picked Guan Yu as my companion on the battlefield. It started me in a different place on the map than it would have started me if I'd have gone with Sun Jiang, the other guy.
Fuck me, I'm so bad at these names. Liu Bei is the main dude I was thinking of, by the way. Sorry about that.
I mean, there's about 800 characters in this game, to be fair to me. So, yeah, the other thing that they add to the battles, to heighten the drama over the previous ones, they do these things called Grand Battles, where there's like a thousand dudes you'll just see lined up. Then someone starts banging some symbols together, basically, and then it's like a proper sort of, uh, sort of like, you know, the big battle sort of crescendo moment.
And then you get these objectives where, if you kill a certain number of dudes in a certain time frame, you'll stop something bad from happening. Or if you can protect a character who's pulling off some bullshit, then they will wipe out loads of these dudes at once. And they, too, add to the sort of drama of the battles.
Fuck, it's a good game!
At those moments, like the huge battles, and they often start with a charge where everyone gathers and then you charge in and the camera pulls back to show you it. They're some of the most impressive graphics I've seen in a game, in terms of how smooth it is. It's pretty amazing.
The ones they made with Nintendo were often beautiful things, but they ran like shit. I think the second Zelda one they did, the Breath of the Wild one.
Age of Calamity.
Yeah, Age of Calamity. It is one of the worst performing Switch games I played. I really hope actually with Switch 2 they can re-energise that.
I'd love to play that and see it going at full swing. There are certain characters, if you played as the Fairy Fountain, she was so big, it was just like, welcome to like five frames a second. That's what this character's special ability is, they tank the frame rate.
So that sucked. But this one, I'm just a mate, up close everything's quite simple, but the amount it's throwing around, that is never not impressive as a trick.
It's true, even though what you're looking at is, I would say, 360 era from some angles. It's that classic new game with not quite triple A production values thing of like, in some places like the effects and stuff, it looks like a modern game. And then from some angles, it just looks like a 360 game because of the simplicity of the character models and stuff.
That is true. But I think when it all kicks off and the special move camera work is swizzing around you, and there's all the thousands of people. I'm not saying, oh, this feels next-gen, but I get the feeling of, oh, I'm playing a really nice current-gen version of this.
I feel like my console is doing something for me here. I'm getting a bit of juice out of it, finally.
Yeah, yeah, that is true. And those big battles just deliver. Honestly, they deliver so much, I think.
They just can be so exciting. The end of Chapter Two Battle is so good because there's a moment where you have a duel with a character who you do not expect to even turn up on the battlefield. That is amazing.
And just that thing of like Dong Zhuo has got to fucking die. So it made me think about like the Battle of the Bastards or something in Game of Thrones. Just sort of like, but just, you know, and it's amazing that it's able to simulate that.
Because again, I did used to just think of Dynasty Warriors, where you sort of gently go on tour around a battlefield, killing hundreds of dudes until you kill the right dude and the whole thing ends. But there's not really a sort of like set PC mentality to it. It was more, it was more just like, it's a big land of stuff where this, you've always got a scale with Dynasty Warriors.
But here there's like handcrafted moments and things you can do as a player to turn things in your favor. Oh, fuck, I do like this game. So I think of where I sort of like, there is a sort of thing in my head where I'm like, there are caveats, because like I say, it is flabby around the outside and it is so Dynasty Warriors.
I feel like you just need some history to understand what you're getting into with it a little bit. But it's like, it's such a good version of that specific formula. I'm really impressed by it, you know?
Yeah, it's good. They've, you know, it's, you know, like between this Nioh, obviously this push for Ninja Gaiden, we've obviously got to see how Ninja Gaiden 4 works out. But it's kind of exciting, you know?
Shet McCoy kind of got the juice.
Yeah, I agree. It's cool. So that's our first game of the year, like a nice January game to kick things off.
Yeah, enjoying that so far. So Matthew, what's your second game?
My second game is The Root Trees Are Dead. Are you aware of this one?
Yes. Is this a, this was an itch project that got turned into a full game with like proper art quite recently. And it's a bit, I've been told it's a bit like, is it Obra Dinn in miniature kind of thing?
Sort of. It's kind of like Obra Dinn meets her story in that it is fundamentally a deduction game, except instead of a ship full of dead bodies, you're trying to fill in the family tree of this family called The Roottrees, who are kind of, they've run like a candy empire for like the last 90 years. And so the family is absolutely massive.
You're trying to fill in their family tree for various narrative reasons. And for each member of the family, you need to find their name, their most recent or last profession, and a picture of them. And when you lock them in, you lock them in three at a time.
So a bit like Obra Dinn, you know, you put in three and then it goes, yes, this is correct. You've got the things right. The differences where in Obra Dinn, you walked around a ship sort of observing everything to learn the information.
Here you're armed with a kind of rudimentary version of the Internet set in 1996, I think. So it's quite a crude sort of like text browser. You have a sort of periodical website that if you know the name of a newspaper and a keyword, you can type it in and see if there is anything in there.
Or you can look up library books if you've got the author's name and the name of the book. And from this, you basically go around the Internet, collecting scanned bits of information, downloading photos, getting magazine excerpts, books, cassettes and CDs of various bits of music. And those are the things that you kind of dig through for information to try and learn out, learn who the Roottrees Are.
It probably sounds like a little bit boring compared to Overdine, because there you're in like big 3D recreations of like crime scenes. But what I do like about this is that they use the time period well in that the internet hasn't got everything on there. And the idea that you kind of glean a piece of information from one article and decide that it's important, then you quickly type that into your, you know, whatever, spider search I think it's called.
And then if that brings up a website which suddenly pings with a bit of information and takes you kind of off in all these different directions, it has the the exciting moments that Obra Dinn has of loads of dominoes falling, where it's like well if this is this, then this definitely means that. And that stuff's really fun. I mean it's very intellectually satisfying to fill that thing in and see it filling out.
And the nature of the family and what they do over the years takes you in loads of different directions. You know, some of them go into the movies, some of them become the sort of like evangelical preachers. Some of them just follow in the footsteps of the head of the family and take over the candy factory.
Some people fall out. You know, there are people who are of a questionable sort of bloodline connection, who other people want to like force out of the family. You learn all this drama and the sense of making a breakthrough and it feels a lot more relatable, I guess, because you are dealing with family trees, which people can do and if you ever have done like a My Family Tree or one of those websites, you know, it does capture the thrill of making a breakthrough and realising that this person mentioned over here actually could be this person here if you can only kind of firm up the evidence somehow and that sense of everything kind of clicking into place, you know, and it not just being about dead people, but being about the lives of all these different people.
It can take you in a lot more different directions, I guess, than a murder mystery can. It feels more like playing an internet detective, which I imagine lots of people have. Like, you know, you look up old friends from school and you want to try and work out who they are.
And, you know, you type their name in and loads of pictures come up on Google Images. And then you're like, well, it's probably not that person for this reason. And like, oh, well, they did move to that city, so that could be them.
Alexa Chung's on the telly, et cetera.
But that's, you know, what I'm basically saying, like if you're a cyberstalker and you've mastered the arts of cyberstalking, this is like a very wholesome way of expressing that desire without like upsetting anyone eventually, because it's a fictional family.
Using that skill set, you have no other use for basically.
Yeah, absolutely, you know, and it's just like being good at research, being able to put like these two pieces of information together. I will say some of it is a little bit obvious, like the second it ever gives you a name or the name of a film or the name of a book or something really firm. Well, I'm obviously searching that.
And it becomes a little bit in the later hours about scanning web pages for, you know, basically proper nouns you haven't searched for. And that way you can brute force your way through it, which I don't think you can in something like Obradin.
Her story you can a little bit.
Her story, absolutely. You know, like, you're obviously not going to search for regular words. The second there's any specificity, you're like, well, I'm on that.
And nine times out of ten, that will be the next step. So that there's a version of this where I think you could blundee your way through quite comfortably. Where I think it maybe becomes a bit more interesting and a bit more testing is that once you've put together the Root Tree family tree, that is the game known as The Root Trees Are Dead.
It opens up a second campaign which they've made for this retail release called Root Tree Mania, which is set a little bit later and is about the fallout of what you discover in the original game, where loads of other root trees have allegedly come out the woodwork and you have to basically work out who's legit and who isn't. So you're now digging through rumour and speculation and a lot of affairs and bastard children and things like that. It becomes a lot hazier and it does feel like a step up.
It does feel like Root Tree's hard mode. They changed the input device where instead of just picking the name from a shopping list, which is what you do in The Root Trees Are Dead, you have to scroll through the first names and surnames differently. So you have to start building names out and it feels like it's a lot more uncompromising.
It's like if you don't know what you're doing, I don't think you'll be able to make any headway in Root Tree Mania. I maybe enjoyed that a little bit more, just because it felt like there was more going on and it was taking everything I'd learned in the first game and kind of pushing it further. So yeah, I did have a really good time with this.
I just thought that there were bits where I felt like it was playing itself a little bit based on how obvious it was, what I should and shouldn't be searching for.
Yeah.
But that's... When do you ever get these Obra Dino-likes? You know, they're quite hard to make, making them watertight and so that you can't accidentally stumble on the end right at the start.
That takes great skill, I think. And they block you off in some clever ways and plant little crumb trails for you to follow. And yeah, I was generally impressed and thankful it exists.
Yeah. I think the fact that it's maybe got a slightly higher bar to succeed in some ways is maybe it maybe sounds like it's slightly more in of it in an advanced bucket of detective games as opposed to if it's your first detective game play this kind of thing. Is that fair?
Yeah, that's that's fair for sure. Certainly with with Root Tree Mania, which well you can't play that without having played the base game. Yeah, that's that's true.
I just think there's yeah, there's definitely something to be said that it's not about dead bodies necessarily, you know, it's it's just about people and what people do in their lives. And it's quite believable, like how the family sort of spreads out and goes in all these mad directions. And you kind of feels quite vividly rendered in your head.
Yeah, I think so, because every family has, you know, when you get into the realms of like, you know, third or fourth cousins or whatever, people you never meet, but you have like a tiny bit of a genetic connection to. And you've maybe heard their names over the, you know, you know, my mom will often talk about sort of her uncles that we never met or, you know, people like that, you know, that that layer, you know, several generations removed and, you know, it's because a lot of them have died, obviously, but there is this sense that you only ever know this quite small pocket of your family at any given time. And, you know, god knows who is out there.
Like, all these interesting people are in your family potentially, and that's, you know, that's quite exciting. If your family was as interesting as the Roottrees, that would be, it would be unlikely, because they're obviously, you know, they're a pretty wild bunch. But, yeah, it does get you thinking about that stuff, which is, you know, quite a nice thing to mull on.
Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't, if you want to sort of uncover a family history that's like nine blokes who look a bit like ugly versions of Freddie Mercury wandering around Sunderland. That's like my family tree, basically.
Really?
Yeah, I've got this, sorry, I don't think I've mentioned this to the podcast. I've got this running joke about how Freddie Mercury, I mean, I kind of need to see my dad to get this. Freddie Mercury is like, if he could plausibly be the hottest member of my family, it's sort of like there's something in the teeth in particular that just has a tiny bit of like Roberts energy to it.
We've gone down a completely the wrong path here with the podcast.
That's exactly the path I was hoping this would go down. I don't have any firm examples of this from my family, but that's interesting.
It's like there's so many people who look like... There's so many different versions of my dad on his side of the family. They all look like different versions of him, even the women in some cases, which is just super disturbing.
And I look a bit like my dad. But none of them have really gone on to do anything that notable. I agree that fundamentally most people's families are just quite mundane.
Well, there you go. If your own family tree is boring, then here's an exciting family tree. This is the experience I think people actually want when they're filling in those genealogy websites.
Actually, they dry out about four generations back. I hope you're going to find a picture of someone from like 1900 who looks just like you, but there are no pictures on there. And it's quite disappointing.
But this is that in full effect.
Yeah, on my mum's side of the family, there's like someone I've heard about who was... So my mum's side of the family, she's on her dad's side. Apparently at some point during...
I think this is bullshit, but this is exactly why I think people get into all this what's it in me kind of like genealogy stuff like you say, is that he owned a speakeasy during prohibition in New Jersey, which is a bit too heightened, I think, to be real and too interesting for a member of my bloodline to be involved in. But that is the sort of thing. Do you think that people investigate this stuff because they find their own lives so mundane?
Is that too cynical a thing? Or is it just an age thing where you become more curious about your family history as you get older? Because it seems to be older people who do it, right?
Well, I did a stretch of this at the end of last year. I got a free subscription to something, so I started sniffing around. There was a certain thrill of like, wow, there's someone 115 years ago who is my great-great-great-great-grandfather or whatever.
Like a Ruben Castle. You're like, that's interesting. I wonder what his deal is.
But what I really wanted was to see a picture. I think that's what most people want. They just want to see, like, yes, that's where I clearly come from that.
You know, I don't want legal documents that show me I came from that. I want a vibe with some guy from the 19th century.
You want you in a flat cap, basically. That's what you're after.
Yeah, or just anything. Just learn, or learn what they did. You know, the jobs and everything.
Just learn that they were, like, you know, like a famous policeman or something interesting. You know, did something of note. You know, I just, yeah.
I get it. Yeah, that makes sense.
Interesting. I didn't get that from The Roottrees.
No, that's fine. It's an interesting sort of dimension of the game anyway. Yeah, I think I've learned my lesson a little bit with detective games and think that maybe there's a certain type of them I jail with and certain ones I don't.
I did look at the Steam page of this. I was pleased to see it's found a bit of an audience, Matthew. People who like this really like it, which is cool.
But I think it's not quite my sort of thing. However, I depend on you to bring these games to my attention and explain them in a way that makes them exciting to the listeners.
I'd rather you didn't play them and we left it at that, then you did play them and then we awkwardly tipped around each other because you don't like the thing that I really like, aka the Obra Dinn effect.
Well, no. But I accept that Obra Dinn was masterfully crafted. I just don't think I have the brain for it.
Sometimes I just reach my intellectual capacity. It's not that hard for me to reach that. Then I go back to Dynasty Warriors Origins, where my lack of brain capacity is spot on for the task at hand.
That's the flamboyant Freddie Mercury in you. That's what that being these kids getting in. You just want to show off on the battlefield and wave a big stick around your head.
Just to be very clear, I'm not related to Freddie Mercury. He just looks a bit like my dad in certain photos. Anyway, time to move on.
My second game is Neva, a 2024 release that I picked up and thought I'd clear through in a 2024 mock-up effort, which also includes me trying to finish Star Wars Outlaws at some point, and probably a couple of other things that I've forgotten, but not too many things before the 2025 games rush really kicks off. But this game is by Nomada Studios. Think that's how you pronounce that.
The developer of it, it's a game where you play this young woman who goes around with a wolf companion. It's from the Developers of Gris game that came out a few years ago. It's a kind of like, I would say, Instagram-y platformer, sort of like nice art filters, lots of sort of a picture.
You're playing as a sad woman and I feel like you went past a lot of statues of women in various poses, just like very sort of of its moment kind of indie game success. It was like a huge hit, but I didn't totally get on with it because I thought it was too lightweight as a platformer, not very interesting. And I didn't really totally get the vibe of the world or the sort of overall sad lady thing it was going for.
Wasn't that interested? This one I was a bit more interested in because it's a side scrolling game with a similar art style. It's quite different what they go for using the same talents that brought Gris to life.
But it's sort of like a game where you play as this young woman going around with this wolf companion that grows over the course of the game. And it's a side scrolling platform game with puzzles, but also has a proper combat system to it, which sets it apart from Gris a bit, made me a bit more intrigued by it. The director of this game is called Conrad Rosette, which, no offence to that guy, is exactly the name I would expect for the guy who made this game in Gris.
This is the kind of analysis you only get on these bad guys.
Yeah, because it has no value. It's not helpful, and it probably seems vaguely offensive, but I mean, no offence by it, but you know what I mean, though? Neva's got big Conrad Rosette energy.
It's just something about that that fits. Published by Devolver, the game is divided across four seasons, and you are fending off shadowy monsters a lot of the time. The thing I wanted to say about this game is it made me think about how, in recent years, the indie games I've been seeking out, I've sought out, have been either incredible versions of things I've played before, like something like Hades, for example, or indeed I gave Obra Dinnigo, fine, I didn't get it, or something like I've literally never played before, like My House.wad or Bellatra, of course, or even the setting in Norco, for example, that was like a...
the setting made that, and the setting and themes made that quite a nice riff on a classic point and click adventure. So I've been a bit more specific, precise, for the things I've been digging out and leaving a lot of other things behind when I feel like I've played them before. And the funny thing about this is I do feel like I've played all of its different parts before.
And I don't think it's exceptional at any one thing, except the 2D art. In some ways, it makes me think about how we've been a sort of like, there are certain archetypes of indie games that have existed for so many years now that when something comes along that pushes particular buttons or tries certain things, they just don't quite register the same impact anymore. And that's hard for a little bit playing this.
It's got a tiny bit of like, Team Ico sort of relationship between player character and a companion, right? It's got emotional things that happen in the story. It's even got the shadowy monsters from Ico turning up and sort of attacking you and your companion, that kind of stuff.
It made me think this is a kind of game that would actually be a perfect first indie game for someone who's just brought a Nintendo Switch or something, but doesn't have years and years of history with games like we do. But I weirdly feel like I bring baggage to it by understanding where all the different parts come from. And even though I think it's like a pretty good version of all those different types of sort of like bits of game I've seen elsewhere, it didn't quite blow me away because that familiarity just, there's a slight diminishing returns effect.
Do you kind of get what I mean with that?
Yeah, absolutely. I think it's the thing that I remember when this was first announced, maybe it was during like a PlayStation Direct or a Game Awards or something. And I was watching it with a crowd of people and they all started joking about like beats that were going to be in this game and things that were definitely going to happen.
And, you know, by all accounts and from listening to other people talk about it, you know, a lot of those things do happen. And it's exactly that thing you're talking about. Like, you're just so familiar with certain kinds of stories and the person and the protector and their animal companion.
Like there are certain things you expect to happen and it sounds like those things do happen and it's quite hard to sort of disconnect your cynically aware brain that understands all these tropes and can see them coming like a mile off. And does it have any sort of any surprises or things where you thought, I haven't seen that before?
Not really. I think I do like the fact that the companion grows over the course of the game. And so the mechanics change slightly.
And, you know, Neva becomes a little bit more capable. And you've always got a slightly different mechanic in each season as well. So at one point you ride Neva through all these wintery landscapes.
And that's quite cool. So you feel like you're really crossing quite a lot of real estate on the back of this dog thing. But I don't think any...
There's nothing... Again, like there's some really nice things it does with the different layers of 2D art, which are visually spectacular. I thought that's cool.
And I'm glad I played this game to see this. But I would say nothing original, nothing out and out original.
So that animal is toast. I can just tell it. I can feel it in my bones.
Chance of survival, like 2%.
Well, I won't spoil it.
It would be a bigger shock if for me, at the end of that game, it was just fine. And that was it.
Yeah, I will say in defense of the developers with that specific thing, they are clearly aware of your expectations as a player for that. So I will definitely give them that. And they have thought about that, I would say.
But yeah, it's that thing of the execution, no real problem with it. But it's funny, when it's an indie game and not a big publisher game, I feel the need to explain myself a little bit when I'm kind of like, well, I've seen all this before. Do you know what I mean?
Whereas I wouldn't even blink when it was an open world game, we had to climb a bunch of towers. You know what I mean? But it just feels like you owe indie games slightly more for whatever reason, because they're made by smaller teams or what have you.
Yeah, I get that.
Yeah, yeah. So that's Nifo. Yeah, probably, probably an 8 out of 10 for someone who's never played this kind of thing before.
But if you're very familiar with the things that inspired this, it'll feel like a 7.
This is great. That is two great bits of assessment about Conrad Rosé and that. I'm digging it a lot.
This sounds to me like if on Game Pass, 100 percent.
Yeah, great weekend Game Pass. You'll probably finish it in one Saturday, about five or six hours long probably, all in. Matthew, should we talk about one more game then take a quick break?
That might be good. I've still got my cold I'm dealing with, so I might have a quick glass of water after this. But you've got another game here.
This is probably one of the more anticipated games of January, a proper breakout indie success that certainly in games media has a lot of people going to bat for it. So why don't you talk about it?
Yeah, this is Citizen Sleeper 2 Starward Vector from Jump Over the Age. Kind of... I mean it's an RPG.
It's set in space, you're going on various adventures, you have to make lots of decisions and they branch the story. But it has some quite tabletop feeling mechanics that define everything. In that there are dice rolls and turns and there are lots of timers and counters and if someone told me this was a digitized version of an existing board game, I would believe them because it has so many parts like that.
And I think it is heavily inspired by certain board games, but it is its own thing. Yeah, so this is a very self-contained sequel. There are a few callbacks to the first Citizen Sleeper.
Certain characters come back, turn up in different places. You are a... what's the best way of describing it?
Kind of like an artificial frame which is designed to hold a kind of human consciousness and do sort of menial tasks. Quite a sort of grim lot in life, but it starts with you being liberated from the organisation where you work, which triggers basically a constant chase in that you are trying to escape with your friend and your former master who has some nefarious plan for you is is trying to hunt you down. So the vague thrust is escape, don't get caught.
And that's slightly slightly different to the first game where it was set. You were a similar situation. You know, you're in this decaying frame, but you are on board a big sort of star station in space.
And it was about fixing yourself up, working out how to extend your life because your body was in this constant state of planned obsolescence, I guess. It was about survival in one place where this is a much bigger feeling adventure in that you're kind of escaping across this solar system. Picking up lots of friends along the way, learning their stories, doing little kind of companion quests with them.
I'd say it's a little bit more Mass Effect-y than the first one in the way that you are kind of building a band together and they all have a loyalty mission of a sort and their storylines run through the whole game as long as you can keep them. I say alive, none of them died for me, but as long as you can keep them loyal and working with you. So it's a much bigger feeling game than the first one.
Just as you go to these different places and each sort of planet or spaceship or star station or weird mining colony you find has a different thing going for it and one of the strengths of the first game and a strength of this one is its ability to tell these small stories. It's very elegantly written in almost that disco Elysium way. It's very text driven, very minimalist interface, but it conjures up the sense of where you are and the stakes of what's going on in just a few very elegantly worded sentences.
It's a very effective bit of world building on a budget where it can't necessarily show you every part of that world. But it really does pull you in. It's quite hypnotic and you do lose yourself to it.
I think what's interesting about this one and something they've spoken about wanting to really build on is that as a collection of systems and resource management, which is what it boils down to, the first game was quite easy to game. If you perform certain actions each day, you could actually generate enough money, enough resources, that you could keep yourself alive and achieve most of what you wanted to do without too much threat or peril. And that kind of negates some of the pressure of making difficult choices and drains some of the momentum from it because you're like, well, you never really feel the threat on a mechanical level.
And this game, I'd say, suffers from a similar problem in that you are being chased by this bounty hunter and wherever you are, they're always five or six days behind you, but you can reset that clock by travelling to another location and you soon learn how to master this this little belt of planets to always stay ahead of them and chip away at your bigger goals so they haven't quite kind of got on top of that. The thing they've introduced to try and sort this out is you have self-contained missions. Imagine them as like very hectic day trips where you basically go to a location, you get locked into that location, and all of a sudden you can't game all the other systems to endlessly drain resources.
You have to deal with whatever you took with you to that location. They're often very high stakes. They can go wrong in all kinds of way, and they're basically designed to sort of fuck you up.
They're designed to force you into making risky dice rolls. The whole game is governed by dice rolls. I could explain all that, but I feel like the game explains it, and I'd only be talking a lot about dice, which isn't particularly interesting to me.
What you have to trust me is that where the rest of the game very rarely put you in a place where you actually really have to risk everything, these are designed to be so tight time-wise, and have so many things that can go wrong and can escalate, that you're like, do I start sacrificing my health to try and get better dice rolls? Do I just power through with low dice? Do I take the negative outcomes?
Do I bet on riskier moves because we've only got three days and this whole spaceship's going to implode? So, and often you can fail them completely and leave them in such a mess that you think, well, this is going to be game over, there's no way I can crawl my way out of this. But then you are back in that that wider environment and if you have the sort of wherewithal to do it, you begin chipping away and manipulating the systems to kind of crawl back.
So it does have this quite nice rhythm of places where you go to risk it all and often pay the price and think, well, I'm never getting out of this. But you do find a way like the story finds lots of ways of not shrugging off your mistakes, but it wants you to push forward. It isn't about resetting, it wants your story to have big failed moments along the way and it can accommodate those.
That's definitely a strength. I almost wish that it could find a way of putting that pressure on in the rest of the game. It's kind of weird to me that there's only these self-contained places where it really felt like the shit could hit the van.
The rest of the place, I was like, it's pretty kind of gentle going again. I also think, and this is purely personal taste, and it may seem like an odd criticism, there is something a little bit on the nose and obvious about a lot of its positive outcomes and what it deems good. Everyone's very gentle, very kind.
Sometimes it's a little bit like reading right on Twitter feed. It has a bit of that.
Well, this is what let people level the Dragon Age a little bit, right? It's a similar thing of...
Yeah, but it's...
Does it lack a little bit of conflict between the friendly characters? Is that maybe something?
Everyone you meet is very decent, and it felt like 21st century decency in this mad scientific setting.
Right, right.
It almost felt like, can't we imagine situations beyond our own a little bit? Not to the point where I have take any issue with it. I just found it.
It's slightly pandering, maybe.
That's interesting. That's a genuinely interesting criticism, because it sounds like the universe they've created is interesting enough to take you through the rest of the game. But even the mechanics, despite the lack of tension outside of those mission bits, is certainly drawing you in enough for you to finish it.
That's definitely something. But yeah, it's sort of like...
They just have, like, everyone has, like, really recognisably good values, and they are good people for holding those values. I didn't feel there was any, like, spice in anyone I met. Yeah.
You know, there was no one I was really conflicted about ever. There is definitely a case to be made for, like, don't-fill-games-with-assholes who make us feel like we're having a bad time. Maybe people don't want bad hangs, but aside from, like, the out-and-out villain after you, there's, like, not a terminal softness, but something, something there that I was like, hmm, is this, is this quite right?
Conflict is not the enemy, that's the thing. It's, you know, it's, conflict is what makes stories interesting and exciting. And, you know, if Han Solo was just a nice guy when you met him, you probably wouldn't, it probably wouldn't have been as iconic a character as he was.
You, you know, you're sort of the reason that people like some of those massive crew members as they bring certain tensions into the crew, right? Some of them are nice, but some of them have their own perspectives that force clashes, that kind of thing.
It's weird, because it's all stuff that I like sort of fundamentally agree with, but I just, I don't know if I bristle at hearing stances given back to me. Let's start a co-op in space, co-operatives are great, and you're like, yeah, the solution here is to unionise, and you're like, yeah, and it's just, it's all things like that, you know, you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, of course.
Matthew needs to watch Taylor Sheridan shows now to get a bit of sort of like the other side in his life.
But hey, it's like quite a kind, nice version of space. There are some quite frightening odd bits in it with AI that you won't go into for like spoiling the story, but you go to some strange places and you're kind of forced to make some moves that you wouldn't necessarily think are entirely wise, and it definitely goes places. I had a good time with it.
I played it pretty solidly for two days to get through it. I'd just love if there was one amazingly written dickhead on this crew, or just something, you know? Someone there, because whoever writes it is clearly a very gifted writer.
I'd just like to see a bit more going on.
That's fair enough. Interesting set of observations there, Matthew. Did you play the first one as well?
A little bit of it. I actually went back and played it through because I was curious how it differed from the first one.
Right, right, yeah.
They both got different strengths. The single location of that first one does make it feel very… like you really know that place inside out and that sense of scavenging in this one environment is quite interesting.
But the second one obviously can take you to lots of places, which is exciting. So it definitely earns its place. I think if you love the first one, you'll love this one.
The on-the-nose-ness I would apply to some of the stuff in the first game too. So people clearly like this world and that viewpoint.
Indeed. Okay. Well, good stuff.
That's available on Game Pass as well, I believe. Citizen Sleeper 2. So yep, go enjoy that.
Or yearn for more conflict, as Matthew does. Okay, Matthew, let's take a quick break then. And we'll come back with three more games to look back on.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, got a few more games to discuss before we wrap up here. Slightly longer, what we've been playing than usual.
But, you know, we've, I don't think we've done one of these since November, Matthew, so it kind of makes sense. We'd have a few takes backed up.
Yeah, we'll only give the listeners a few wrecks to take away with them.
Indeed, or in the case of this next one, just some things that I did, and have no real strong takes one way or the other. Marvel Rivals is my next game. The latest hot character shooter, multiplayer thing, been very successful on Steam, and would appear to have broken through in a way that not all live service games have in the last few years.
Probably helped by having that property attached to it. An interesting game in the sense that the character designs I think are actually the best thing about it, because I think that people are very used to those homogenized MCU style designs of the different Marvel characters by now. And this game takes what I would describe as a slightly anime-ish, maybe even like My Hero Academia-ish approach to remixing the character designs a bit.
And I think that that is the kind of thing that will extend their relevance as the films go through these sort of like dicey years of people not being totally sure about them. Some of the designs I think are just exquisite. Like I love the Star-Lord design in this.
That's really, really good. The vast majority of them are good. Only a couple of them like Thor and sort of Wolverine that don't really sort of like don't quite work for me.
But it's a really nicely sort of like portrayed version of these characters and lots of interaction between them. That sort of thing. The game itself is is like pretty.
It's like at its base. It's really easy to pick up and play and quite enjoyable. And I will say I've only played a couple of evenings of this.
So not hugely informed, nor do I give a shit about people doing tier rankings or the e-sports scene or any of that shite. No one cares.
In fact, I'm going to do a tier ranking of all the root trees. All 56 of them.
Amazing. Yeah. So it's that thing where I think it's designed to be pick up and play and not designed to have that really high sort of e-sports ceiling.
The thing I've really got into, and I think this is something that often like amateur players do when they pick up these kinds of games is pick a tanky character and then do some bullshit and log off. And in this case, the Punisher has this thing where he pops up a turret and the turret can just do loads and loads of damage if you place it right correctly and the enemy team doesn't realize you're there. You just shoot them all.
You can just take out a whole team in like a few seconds if you're lucky. If you're playing against good players, they'll have like good counters to that. But I've had a few occasions where I've just cleared house and been like, hey, problematic Punisher at work and I'm having a good time with it.
However, after two evenings, I already feel like I've extracted all the joy from this I'm ever going to have. Which is maybe, I know that maybe seems a little bit pessimistic for something that's just come out, but I think it will probably be successful anyway. Success is not my problem, player fucking concurrence, not my problem.
But I do think that picking up playing it being like, oh, that's a really nice version of these Marvel characters. Oh, it's got all this voice acting in it. And then being like, oh, some of these powers are really cool, but I feel kind of done with it.
I feel like I've seen everything it's got to offer is an okay way to engage with a game like this. The pick up and play nature of it is really nicely done though. And it's a good hangout game, but it's weird to have been like, oh, wow, I really get this straight away, which is how I felt when I first started playing it, to reach the point of, I think I could never play this rev, I'd never play this again and live a perfectly happy life, you know?
And that's the journey I've been on with this.
But I'm trying to work out what it is that has to kick in to give you that feeling that you do need to come back. Like, is there not enough drama to it or?
No, all that's in there. I mean, it's got some of the standard kind of like hero shooter, overwatchy sort of modes of recent years, like the stand next to the thing while it very slowly moves to the other side of the environment. It has that, it has hold the king of the hills, hold the different checkpoints where you rack up points, it's got that.
They are in there. It's just that I think that maybe the special source for me with these kind of games and thinking about my relationship with Apex is finding a character where, well, first of all, I think Apex is just immaculate first person shooter design. And I've said this before, but like the player movement is the magic of that game, sliding around and how athletic it feels, how much control you're given over that as a player.
I mean, it's the COD 4 Infinity War team, right? These are people who know exactly what they're doing. With this game, it feels like a bit more like it is designed to be sort of junky and disposable.
And like not in a way that I think, I think for some people it will still be appealing enough to keep them coming back over and over again, hence how successful it's been. But for me, it's a bit like, I don't think it, I haven't quite reached the point where it feels like the game is for me, or there's any one part of it that's designed where I'm like, oh, I really get this, and I really, there's just something about the way this game is designed that really clicks with me. And I think that is what it takes me for a multiplayer game to really sort of sink in.
So yeah, I'm guessing you've not played this, Matthew. Have you encountered it at all in the wild?
Only in having to do little preview videos of it here and there for PlayStation Access, things like that. So I've seen it in action. I've not played it.
It's got lots of stuff collapsing in it, right? You can like...
Yeah, you can blob big parts of the environment. And then that's interesting because a wall will collapse and then the shape of the map will change based on that, for example. So I've seen Tony Stark fucking icing a couple of walls or whatever and then the map changing on the fly.
That is quite different. That is quite cool. So it actually does feel sort of like it.
I can't see this being a game that would ever work on phones. It feels like it needs a bit of the next-gen muscle to actually work. So that is also good.
It doesn't feel like sort of it's a game that's designed to be on as many formats as possible. It's sort of you have to go and seek it out on a nice PC or an Xbox or PS5. So yeah, it does look the part.
And yeah, the destructible maps are kind of cool, but I don't know. There's a couple of other things as well. This is a really specific thing, right?
But the Iron Man voice actor, the Tony Stark in it.
This is the good stuff.
This is the Conrad Rosette observation of this. He's the same guy. I think it's the same guy they got in Marvel's Midnight Suns, right?
And what I can't get out of my head is that he sounds like fucking Henry Cerny from Mission Impossible. So he's like, Pepper, Pepper Potts, Pepper. He's like, he's always talking like that.
This is Canadian Robert Downey Jr. I don't quite get what we're going for. And every time he speaks, he just sounds a little bit like this, and Pepper. It honestly just does my head in a little bit.
I'm like, it's that thing where I either want it to be 10 percent closer to Downey Jr. or 40 percent further away. But Jay Bayliss made this point when we were playing, he was like, the problem is that Downey Jr. is completely, that is that character now. So even though there's like decades of Iron Man history where that character is not necessarily the sort of like wisecracking playboy in quite the same way.
You know, he was always a genius with a silly Iron Man suit. But now it is just Downey Jr. and it's different sort of like bits of that. But yeah, every time that guy talks and like...
You think the race is on to enjoy Doctor Doom before it becomes Robert Downey Jr. Doctor Doom for everyone.
Yeah, there's still a bit of time. Yeah, but it's just I think of like, I don't want to call him like Tmoo Downey Jr. Because I think we've gone a bit too far down that route of like saying the little or Tmoo version of X. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But it's just like I say, either be further away or slightly closer. But in that hinterland, it's just a bit of a does my head in for me dog kind of thing. So yeah, there's my highly specific observation, Matthew.
Not quite my sort of thing. Intrigued to know if people, if the listeners have like clicked with this game and kept going with it. But I feel like I've seen all the good bits now can jump off, which is, you know, I know not the intention of these things, but I'm perfectly happy to have that relationship with the game.
So it's fine by me. And on that note, Matthew, we come to your final game of the episode.
This is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which I've managed to squeeze in about 10 hours with.
Impressive. On top of all, yeah, you know, sort of Citizen Sleeper and Dynasty Warriors.
Yeah, I have been caning the game since January. Catherine was away, so I got to play a lot of stuff before she was away. That's how we did it.
Yeah, like really early thoughts on this one, as I always ask you on these episodes. Have you played any Kingdom Come before?
No, I don't know why I didn't get to this. I mean, obviously I was sort of there on PC Game Boy and all the drama kicked off around it. But no, even though it sounded like it was sort of the sort of old school PC style, like a tiny bit rough around the edges, but pretty great at its heart, sort of like in-depth RPG that people would really dig.
That is the interesting thing about it. It's kind of like real life medieval Skyrim style game, big open world, you plod around, develop this character, you play as Henry, who is a peasant basically, you know, who over the first game gets a bit of a foothold in slightly higher echelons of his society and goes off to deliver a letter at the end of that game, where this game kicks off with him and his mate Hans Capon going to deliver this letter. It all goes horribly wrong over a very linear scripted two-hour tutorial sequence, which I quite enjoyed.
Hans Capon is this intensely irritating dude. He's meant to be everything that's bad about the aristocracy. He has absolutely no respect for other life.
He takes everything for granted. He's just a real pain in the arse. Constantly gets into trouble.
Doesn't really respect Henry, even though they have this strange friendship. These two hours are kind of him at his worst. It's quite a bad hang.
But by design, so I don't think that's a failing. They've written him to be this terrible asshole who you are semi-responsible for. And the first two hours are just him making terrible decision after terrible decision along the way, teaching her a little bit of sword fighting, a little bit of sneaking, you know, a little bit of socialising with characters.
And basically ends up that all the progress you've made during the first game is reset through a series of just drunken blunders and general idiocy, which I quite like as a set up for a game.
That's cool.
It isn't that some mad spell comes along and like strips you of your power. This isn't a world with magic or anything. It's just like enough bad decisions in succession basically leaves you stranded in the middle of nowhere.
No clothes, no money, no one to vouch for you. And, you know, in their eyes, you look like a peasant, you sound like a peasant, so you're basically fucked. You are where the first game basically started all over again, which I quite enjoy.
So I've spent this this 10 hours scrabbling for an existence, trying to get a foothold in this world. And if you haven't played Kingdom Come before, where it differs from most open world RPGs is that it's quite hostile towards you and it's quite stern with various survival mechanics. It sort of feels like it's simulating quite a lot from like your obvious things like how tired you are and how hungry you are.
So, you know, a bed you can sleep in and food you can eat, you know, hopefully not rotting food that will make you sick. Those are your two basics. But then it also has things like your charisma, your ability to talk people around and have access to all the kind of speech craft skills that you might associate with branching RPGs.
They're dictated by how clean you are, how nice your clothes you're wearing. So at the start, you're basically just in like a sack and covered in shit and smell terrible. It's really hard to make any progress because no one believes anything you say.
It's taken like 10 hours to even crawl out of the gutter a little bit. And I fail maybe nine in ten conversations I have with people. And you just have to kind of go with it.
And it feels like it's beating you down constantly because when you do finally make headway or you get your head around a system or you manage to level something up, you've really achieved something in this quite hostile world. So as an opening 10 hours, it's quite hard to sell. You might not have like a huge amount of fun.
You might have to recalibrate what's fun. If you want to see every quest play out exactly as you want it, you know, forget it early on basically. You've got to fail some quests to start levelling up.
It's one of those games where you level up individual disciplines by doing those things. So like the more you run, the better you get at running. You know, the more you sword fight, the better you get at sword fighting.
But it does mean you have to throw yourself into those situations while you are generally incapable of them to actually get that first foothold. Some people may find that just too aggressive towards them.
Quite bold. Quite a bold set of choices.
It is bold, but I think it fits the world because it's very like low key. Set in like countryside, a smattering of towns. You can go for hours without having a fight and you might want that because if you're fighting more than one person at the start of the game, you are gonna die.
About five, six hours in, I went to a poaching camp, I had to clear out and there were five guys there and it took me probably about an hour and a half of dying and reloading just to take down five guys and slowly whittle away at them and if you don't mind doing that and you find satisfaction in that, very slow, hard graft, it becomes quite rewarding. What I wouldn't want to be doing is reviewing it under a tight time constraint. I'm really interested to see what happens.
I think the reviews will be out by the time you listen to this. Forcing yourself to really rush through what feels like it's gonna be like a big game, it has the shape of a 100 hour RPG, I think, from looking at the map and everything. Trying to do that and bumping up against those systems, you can't brute force your way through, you have to lock into its rhythms.
That's always a big hurdle at review time, because people don't have the time to do that. I am quite happy to be making slow progress and I am enjoying it. It's got good vibes though, it's quite boring countryside, I don't mind trudging through it, I quite like the very nice grass effects, it's got excellent forest, this was something in the first game too.
It's a lot of tree variety, it knows that you're not going to be seeing anything more spectacular than a forest, probably. So it makes those forests and woods super authentic feeling and kind of gnarly to explore and that I really appreciate. It's like lacking anything deliberately spectacular and so you begin to reassess what you find impressive and you begin to think, oh, it's raining, this is exciting.
You see one lightning bolt and you're like, holy shit, that's amazing, that's the best thing I've ever seen. It's just because you've been walking in the mud for days and nothing's happened. And if you've got the kind of mind that can meet it halfway, I think it is going to be really rewarding.
Yeah, this is for the people who are saying that Stalker 2 is the best game of last year. I feel like this game is made for those kinds of players, primarily PC. Don't mind a bit of hard work to get to the good stuff, but the good stuff is something you won't get with any other game.
Yeah, that's right. It's like medieval RPG Stalker. I'd say it's got a slightly friendlier face.
While its core systems are quite abrasive, the actual missions are closer in tone to something like The Witch. There's a lot of humour in them. They go to some quite wild places.
They really take you around the houses. They're very flexible as well. You are constantly fucking them up and it will take you in other directions.
It's possible to do a quest which might take someone two hours, but you may accidentally stumble upon the final step of it just while you're exploring. And the game can adapt to that and has lines of dialogue to accommodate that. They've made a big point, I think, on Twitter.
So that it's one of the longest game scripts ever written. Because there are so many branching paths to all the quests. And that stuff I feel like most people would enjoy.
The level of narrative craft and the fact that they've tried to do it with good humour, that isn't necessarily something I associate with, like, a stalker. Which is kind of uncompromising in tone as well as systems. There's a version of this where without all that simulated stuff, this is as much a fun romp as like a Witcher 3.
But it can't be because of those things. I just did a quest, basically half an hour getting pissed up with these Hungarian horsemen, and that's quite a tropey RPG questline. They're going out and have it getting drunk, and then what wild adventures do you get up to, and you get so drunk that you see like a dog that starts talking to you.
But it's quite well observed. There's a really funny bit where, after spending a night getting pissed up with these guys, for about a minute you can speak perfect Hungarian. It's made me laugh a couple of times, which most games don't.
But then coming out of that quest, I was at maximum drunkness, which is like really debilitating in this game. The drunk you get, the lower your stats are. So it basically lowered all my stats to like nothing.
So I couldn't do anything. I couldn't find anywhere to sleep. I was starving.
I was tired. And I was stumbling around the country side, dying a lot. This is the other side of this game.
It's like have all this fun, but now you've got to deal with like the mechanical consequences. And there are lots of people who will just be like, fuck that latter noise. And I completely get that.
But I think it is worth pushing through for the fun that you have in the first part.
It's been quite a long time in development as well, hasn't it? It was I think 2018 or 2017, the original came out.
Yeah, that's right.
So it's like a long time. So it sounds like maybe the time went into like the polish around those narrative quests, like getting them super right, which is a good use of the time, you know? I like drunk quests too.
I mean, you know, it's sort of like also using it for actual sort of like comedic effect, like the all-timer transition of Red Dead Redemption 2. I think people always talk about this as like one of the great moments from that game where it seems like it's going to be a fight and then it cuts them all dancing on the bar. Like it's, it sounds like it's got a bit of that energy to it.
Yeah, that's cool. It's cool.
Yeah, it absolutely has. It's just that Red Dead... Actually, there's quite a bit of Red Dead in this in terms of weird context-sensitive controls.
You can talk to people or you can hold a trigger and talk to them for their core function. So, like, if there's a shopkeeper, if you hold one button, you trade with them. If you don't hold that button, you just have a normal conversation with them.
There's a lot of weird shit like that. Lots of tiered button presses. I mean, I spent hours trying to work out how to get my fucking torch out.
So, it was like one of those games, you know? Like, you are going to be on Google searching for this. This is like SEO dream for all the tippers, because there's going to be lots of people like, how do I put on a hat in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?
Because the menu screen is so confusing.
That's like Polygon and Eurogamer traffic sorted for the next year, basically. It's just, you know, all the most basic stuff.
Yeah. I was playing it thinking I could get like a million views on a YouTube tips video for this. This is absolutely like prime tipping territory.
It's all there, but slightly obfuscated, and trying to get to the heart of the matter is definitely trickier than it should be. But yeah, you know, worth persevering with. Obviously, I'll like play a chunk more and report back, see if it's got the juice later on.
I kind of like the fact that it's so obtuse as well, that it rejects being treated like any other sort of like game that you sprint through and then you're like, yeah, I've done it now. And then you have your thoughts and kind of move on. It's a bit like it's not allowing anyone, any of its players to do that, which I do sort of like the idea of like, if you want to enjoy all of the things within this, you have to play by its rules.
It's sort of, I don't necessarily mind game designers doing that, you know, that said, I have not been through, you know, all of the sort of like nightmarish instances you have to get to the good stuff, Matthew. So, you know, yeah.
I mean, it is like, I finally got a pair of trousers and then like a load of wolves attacked me so badly that my trousers were destroyed. And it was like, cool. But we go back to town and you're like, well, you won't guess what happened.
You know, all that work I did brewing up potions and selling them so I could get some trouser money back to square one. And everyone's like, put your fucking trousers on and you're covered in wolf blood and all this kind of stuff. And you're like, I'm just having a real day of it.
Could everyone just like just leave me alone for a little bit?
Hey, time was a PC Gamer editor could turn that into the greatest now playing that you've ever read, Matthew. So yeah, that's funny. OK, good stuff.
Briefly then, the last game I'm going to talk about is Warhammer 40,000, Dawn of War 2, The Last Stand, AKA the game that has replaced Apex Legends as the game I play regularly with my former colleague at PC Gamer, Phil Savage and Tom Hatfield, who used to work at PCG and is a friend as well. We play as a trio this specific mode of an RTS game that is basically like horde mode, except you control one Warhammer 40,000 hero, so it could be like little space marine lad, little imperial guard lad, little Eldar lad, or in my case a Necron lad, though I've been through a few different options here. You basically pick a loadout and then you face wave after wave of different Warhammer 40,000 factions in combat, building up to these climactic waves where you fight clones of your own characters, and then after that clones of your characters and one big chaos bastard, and that is basically the entire point of the mode.
We have played this, I would say since December, I think I've played 18 hours of this, something like that. And we only just finished it for the first time, completed all of the different waves for the first time recently, having unlocked enough stuff and getting the right combination of heroes in order to sort of triumph. And it's weird because I know that to you, RTS is like the least sexy sounding thing in the world.
And but in some ways it's not really an RTS, it's a bit like playing vampire survivors or something, because you're sort of like, even though you're not collecting things throughout the battlefield, it is about crowd control. And you have all these different abilities that affect the way that you deal with enemies. So for example, the Tyranid hero can summon in little Tyranids to do its bidding for it.
And that could be quite good, because you have a little crowd of units who can help sort of like deal with the crowds, that sort of stuff while you're firing away or using like your claws to hack through enemies, whatever it might be. My Necron sort of ability is basically like the Necrons in the tabletop game, it's basically unkillable. So you kill it.
And then as long as another party member stays alive for like 20 seconds, my character comes back with full health basically. So we built an entire strategy basically around the fact that I would die, but then also come back. Right down to the fact that Tom played as another hero that can clone different characters in the game.
And so when we came up against my clone in one of those later rounds, he cloned my clone. So we had two of me fighting on the same side against all these other guys. And it's really hard to describe why playing this is so satisfying.
But it's like gentle optimization. It's like, okay, well, we failed at wave 17 this time, but I think we can crack it if I equip this ability that basically lets me drain the health of every single enemy in within range so I can kill like 20 dudes within 10 seconds or whatever. Or I become invincible because of this one buff that I get for a few seconds or whatever it might be.
Or one of the Eldar characters can summon this storm that makes you invisible. You just go and stand inside it and you get left alone for a little while. Or they can summon a massive, massive storm that just zaps all of the enemies within it with like thunder and wind and shit.
And it's like really visually spectacular, like sort of different take on the RTS that I guess was a complete evolutionary dead end because this never went anywhere. They produced a load of heroes for it, but there are only two maps. Yeah, I'd always heard it was decent.
And obviously, Dawn of War is a series a bit dormant now, which is a bummer. But yeah, I kind of wanted to note this as this is a significant thing that's happened to me in games. But there's no other place for it to go other than talk about on this podcast, Matthew.
Any thoughts?
How did you start doing this? Why was this a good idea?
So we were like, we were so burnt out with Apex, and it's sort of matchmaking and getting like, basically headshot from across the map with a pistol or whatever by teenagers, so whoever the fuck is still playing that game. So that was one part of it. Another part of it was, and so from that we were like, okay, we can download like, we download a Darktide, because that's a co-op game.
And then I think Tom suggested it as a, oh, this, you know what's really good is this specific mode within Dawn of War 2. Dawn of War 2, the kind of game that, like loads of people are just picked up in a Steam sale. I seem to ambiently own it and all the DLC.
So I was like, yeah, sure, why not? And then it was just a thing that we tried one evening and we got so into it and suddenly like four hours had passed. And it's been like that every time.
It's like, we log on at 8.30, suddenly it's 1 a.m. and we've just been playing nonstop. And it's just, stopping for a break every now and then. But it's just like, oh, we didn't quite crack it that way, but let's try again with this, this and this.
And honestly, the range of the different heroes, it just means there's a lot of strategic depth to it. And it doesn't have a sort of like, slow build up of an RTS where you're building bases and shit, because it's literally just, your hero's there, here come the waves of enemies, good luck. And that's the entire experience basically.
How wide of a mark would I be if I'm picturing in my head a kind of co-op game where you're playing as three Tanias from The Alert?
Oh, it's sort of a little bit, it's slightly gentler than that. It's a bit like...
But are the characters steeper than a Tanya?
Yeah, they are because you equip, you can decide whether they focus more on melee or shooting, for one. Like you unlock new weapons as you level up and you unlock new abilities as you level up. And some of them are like defensive based, some of them are more offensive based.
And you start seeing the different ways that you can sort of like jigsaw all your heroes together. Dare I say it, my most hated genre, it's maybe got a tiny bit in common with MOBAs as well, Matthew. You know I fucking hate MOBAs, but you know, I will note that the synergies therein are probably, probably have something in common with that genre.
But it's a bit like playing as a, it's also got a tiny bit of Diablo to it as well, where you sort of like, you're just churning through waves and it's about optimization in the face of that and using different abilities with cooldown timers and stuff like that. But it's just got, it just, it's just got enough to get the blood pumping and the Warhammer-ness of it, I think just adds a little bit of extra spice on top, so.
Was this popular and lauded when this game originally came out?
I think it was celebrated by the fans of it, but it was, I don't think it ever became, well it probably, they did actually do a standalone version of it. And when you log on now, there are still, I think there's still about 300 to 500 people playing it when you log on. So there is a community that has sort of like glommed onto it.
But I do think that it's sort of, it's never really exploded. Because it's a mode within a mode. It's sort of, I don't know, maybe it needed to be a standalone game or something.
I can't quite see the world in which this becomes like a success. Is it a free to play thing or whatever? And certainly Relic is, I don't know what Relic's doing now.
They're no longer part of Sega. They've gone off to do their own thing. But Dawn of War 2 was a success.
But this was sort of like a cult mode within that, you know?
It needs like a PewDiePie or something of that ilk to come and celebrate it on a stream. Is he still a thing?
It's no Skate 3, but what can you do? So that's my last game of the episode, Matthew. But it feels like a nice note to wrap up on.
Yeah, what a wide variety of things.
Yeah, it's certainly a lot in the mix there before the big games really kick off with Monster Hunter next month. So looking forward to it.
Next month, Monster Hunter and Hawaiian Pirates or whatever it's called.
Yeah, and then Assassin's Creed and March, which people are saying is really good. So I've already got that free with my GPU, Matthew. So I shall give that a go.
Yeah, OK. Well, this podcast is over. It was fun, Matthew, to discuss these games with you.
But such a long time since we've done this particular mode of the podcast, I've really enjoyed it, actually. So where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky, at MrBazzle underscore pesto on X Twitter. I haven't updated that. MrBazzlePesto on Letterboxd.
Should you wish? I haven't watched many films this year, so don't expect much action.
Matthew's a good follower on Letterboxd. I've been enjoying it.
I was wounded by your lack of love for Strange Darling, or whatever it was called.
Strange Darling. Yeah. Someone made such a good point in my comments.
They said, if this film was presented in linear order, there would be nothing interesting about it whatsoever versus other thrillers. That dismantled the film for me in my head.
Yeah, but it isn't presented in linear order.
Yeah, but the same wouldn't be true for Memento. Memento is still an interesting film because of the very specific way in which that story is stacked.
Yeah, I do say that.
You know what? I like seeing my guy Kyle Galner out there doing stuff. You know, a big Smallville guy.
I like the Flash in Smallville. He was in Veronica Mars. I'm pleased to see him doing stuff.
Yes, nonetheless. So I'm Samuel W. Roberts on everything as well.
Twitter, though I don't update that much either. Blue Sky, I update that much more frequently. Letterboxd as well, Samuel W.
Roberts. Yep, enjoying that. That's been a good platform of late.
The podcast is at Backpage Pod on Blue Sky and Twitter. patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like two additional podcasts a month and to support us financially. We have no ads at all.
We are completely community supported. Very grateful for all the support we do get. Matthew, let's get out of here.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
