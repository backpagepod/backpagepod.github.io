Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we have some big news for our listeners that we just broke to ourselves behind the scenes.
Oh, when you say that, it sounds like it's gonna be like serious.
Yeah, or exciting, which it's not. It's the opposite of that really. Well, I suppose it's just necessary, I suppose, is probably the best way to put it.
So what's going to happen is in December, me and Matthew are gonna take something of a break. We're going to still make podcasts in December, including our Game of the Year episode, of course. We'll have that go live at the end of the month.
And there'll be maybe a couple of others, but that will be it. And we are going to pause our Patreon pledges for a month. So everyone who supports us on there, which we're incredibly grateful for, we're gonna just not charge you at all in December.
We'll still make those pods, and we will come back in January in full force. But Matthew, I think we've both decided we need a little break in order for the podcast to remain its best self. Is that fair to say?
Yeah, I think so. We've both had quite busy years. We've both got very busy end of years.
And I think we need to be able to like fully recharge and have a period where we're not working or podcasting. But we will do the usual end of the year stuff and that will all be fun. And we're already working on some, some cool stuff for the end of the year bits.
Yeah, definitely. So there will be bits and pieces for sure. And we'll make sure that you feel suitably nourished.
We also might put a couple of Patreon episodes live on the free feed as well, just to tide over some other listeners. But I'm sure that in this modern landscape where people have empathy for people's mental health, that they won't mind us taking a little break, Matthew. And like I say, if they wanna continue supporting us in early next year, we'd massively appreciate it.
And then, yeah, we'll carry on.
I'm getting big. It's Christmas time. It's time to listen to us talk about James Bond on the free feed.
Yeah, we can put that on there. I'm gonna put up the best Metal Gear moments as well for the listeners as well, because they might be getting that Konami collection for Christmas. So I'm modding it on PC so it works properly, has a widescreen or whatever.
So that's something for people to look forward to. We will make sure that you have some stuff to listen to over the break. But yeah, the other good thing is it allows me to go to Japan for two weeks.
So if I do that, I will come back with stories. I will do some kind of Akihabara sort of like spending spree thing. I'm gonna plan this trip incredibly quickly, but yeah, these are all things that will be good for us, I think next year.
Basically you'll get better pods in 2024 if we take a small pause at the end of this year. So yeah, that's happening.
Or based on my pop culture intake, you go to Japan and get killed in a very elaborate strange house.
It's like, oh, this piece of ice fell through me from a very conveniently placed ramp. That's how inconvenient it melted.
Or it all goes a bit audition. Come Christmas, you're basically parts in a sack.
The bonkers end of that book was when basically like the dad and it turns to his son and goes, oh, that was a bit fucking mad, wasn't it? That was basically the end of that book that you got me to read. I was like, oh, weird ending.
This is a great use of a Saturday nonetheless. That's happening, but this episode is what we've been playing. We've got a full roster of pods for November to come.
Matthew, we've got a bunch of games here. You've played loads more than me. Somehow, on top of the games that we've both played, which I know Alan Wake 2 and Super Mario Wonder, you have also played three other games.
How are you doing it? How are you keeping up with this massive array of stuff?
A lot of them I've only played a few hours of, and just enough to have an opinion. No more complicated than that, really.
Fair, okay.
Yeah, sorry, I haven't got some amazing life hack for you.
Okay, now we're getting into why Matthew needs a pause because he's just like, when asked questions like that, he just feels completely defeated, so. Okay, good. So, okay, first game we're going to discuss then is Alan Wake 2, sequel from Remedy, 13 years in the making.
And it is a really interesting proposition because it is a harder swerve into survival horror than Remedy previously did. Its gameplay mechanics are roughly similar to Alan Wake's in the sense that it is a narrative-driven game where you basically use light to burn this protective layer off of monsters before killing them, monsters normally being some kind of possessed human-type enemies. And that is all the same, but the presentation, I would say, has had a massive jolt in the arm, like the format in which that sort of story and gameplay is presented.
So you have two different main characters in this one. Alan, who is trapped in some other place, that is for the players to discover really, but basically like a sort of spooky alternate dimension. If you played previous Alan Wake games, then it kind of gives you an idea of what to expect here, although I played those and just didn't really remember what had happened.
And at the same time, you play as a character called Saga Anderson, who is trying to resolve larger mystery of what happened to Alan, but also what happened to this author who was connected to Alan as well. But it's kind of unraveling the mystery of what happened 13 years ago in the events of the first game. So I think that's roughly the overarching plot, although I haven't played as much of it as you, Matthew.
But I think what is really interesting is, like I say, that jolt in the arm it's had in terms of presentation means that storytelling wise, Remedy has set their sights higher, maybe than they ever have before, in terms of what they can do, in terms of narrative presentation, like it's the settings they take you to, the ideas they have. It's like, you know, epic games, sort of Fortnite money, basically just sort of bankrolling all of the big crazy ideas they might have had over the years and in the best possible form. It feels like it has no restrictions in the way that maybe it feels like Control did have a few restrictions in terms of what it could achieve.
So what do you make of that as a way into discussing this game?
Yeah, it's kind of interesting in the run up to it. A lot of the chat about how they were using live action and the fact that some of their preview beats revolved around long clips of like a... You've probably seen clips of this live action late night chat show that Alan Wake finds himself on.
And that kind of gave me the fear that we were gonna be in quantum break territory of you play a bit and then you sit back and watch 15 minutes of like so-so live action stuff. And actually the big surprise here is that, you know, not only that they've had this budget to throw at the kind of polish and production and some of the actors involved, but that they've also found maybe a more interesting way of mixing their live action sensibilities with the gameplay sections, you know, the interactive virtual sections, I guess. They do a lot of interesting stuff in this game with like, I can't really explain the effect, but it's, you know, they've always had live action clips embedded in the world.
Like you watch trailers on TV and it's got actors in and things like that. But they do some really, really nice stuff with like almost like projection in this game, where they kind of project live action clips, not onto walls, but like just in the air, almost like if you imagine projecting an image onto smoke, so it kind of hangs in front of you, but it's sort of see through. And they do a lot of interesting stuff where you can be in a space and then they'll project like in another space over the top of that.
So it kind of looks dual-worldy. And if you know anything about the world of Alan Wake and the fiction of Alan Wake, dual-worlds and light and dark are like very key factors. So having these weird morphing spaces are actually, it's kind of visually quite sensational.
I've not really seen anything like it. And there's been several moments where I thought, oh wow, they've really found a way of like folding, you know, their sort of love of film into a video game in a much more interesting way here. And often you'll be interacting with characters.
Like there's a, you have this sort of sidekick as Saga called Alex Casey, who is a, you know, modeled on Sam Lake. And you have his 3D model, but you will see then a flash of like the real Sam Lake as a video clip over the top. And you know, maybe all its talk of sort of duality and what all this means is a little heavy handed, but there's no denying that like in the moment to moment, I've found that stuff sort of magic to see.
I mean, it's really like very distinct visual identity, this game.
Yeah, for sure. I think it's really impressive what they do with like instant loading in this game as well. You know, where you will bounce between locations or something will just appear in front of you.
Or there's just this feeling that they're using all of the next gen bits, the way that the consoles are supposed to be used in a way that you've not maybe seen before. And I suppose like, I don't know why, but it's surprising to experience that in Alan Wake. I think it's probably not surprising in the sense that Remedy's always been big on pushing tech as we discussed in the episode where we had Simon on.
But I think it's just the fact that maybe it's a generation because it's a generation where we haven't had loads and loads of standouts in terms of games that make you go, whoa, what a great use of the technology. That when you play this game and you see the ways in which they are using technology, it does blow you away in that way you're maybe looking for. It just wasn't the place I expected to find it.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I mean, just the basic bitch take of like, wow, these foggy woods look really impressive. But then when you factor on top of that, the kind of pizzazz of the particle effects is your kind of zapping shadow monsters with your torch.
And then, like you say, the ability to instantly jump into the kind of both characters you players have like a mind palace type mechanic, which you can instantaneously sort of like warp into this room and you can do stuff which can then affect the world. And yeah, that's always good. Like fast loading is kind of the trick of this generation.
And it's been used in very few ways that have actually jumped out at you. Like I'd say between this and Spider-Man 2's fast travel have been like two kind of technical wow moments this year.
Yeah, definitely. It's nice to have that feeling. Final Fantasy 16 does it quite well as well, where you'll just instantly travel across parts of the world or whatever.
And even just loading into the game, you're like, oh wow, I'm just back in this straight away. Just that does have a little bit of residual magic, even if it's not necessarily as big as like, seeing the leap from PS3 to PS4 or PS2 to PS3, for example. That's maybe not what this generation's about.
But yeah, it's also just the fact that but the colors they use in this, it just feels like quite a classy game in terms of their references. It feels like they've expanded their references past being just a Twin Peaks pastiche as well. Like that's definitely part of the mix, but it feels kind of like weirder.
It feels like it's drawing from a more well-rounded bunch of pop culture influences. Do you get that vibe as well?
Yeah, it's interesting. Like when we had Simon on the podcast, he obviously said that they talked to him about like a true detective influence. And I think that comes through maybe at the start in that you are a lawman investigating, we're a law person, investigating a strange cult killing in a kind of forested area.
But I think it slips into like outright supernatural so quickly. I think those claims of sort of true detective being a big influence like faded quite quickly for me. Like it's very silly, this game.
For all I like about it, like I can't take it seriously like at all. Because I find it so over the top. And so where Alan Wake is in this game is just outright, like big mad supernatural bullshit.
And Saga's kind of half of the campaign is quite like the original Alan Wake in that it very quickly descends into madness. And, you know, you're in this seemingly normal town, which strangeness quickly arrives at. And so like the kind of claims that this is like a something more grown up sort of bunch of fiction.
I don't really buy. I'm not really feeling that myself. I actually thought from just like a couple of exchange messages or whatever, that you were going to be quite cool on this, or you were cool on this to begin with.
Yeah, I needed more time to cook with it. And I still do really. And I will keep playing in the run up to our Game of the Year episode.
But I think it's because that first hour is really quite a lot of hard work. And the other thing is that Saga's Mind Palace, sorry, Mind Place, which she's like, she says my version of the Mind Palace technique, the Mind Place. And I'm like, you just removed one letter from that.
But basically just means it's a lot of like interacting with things in the world in a kind of almost point and click adventure style way, really, and then being added to your archive of stuff, Ace Attorney style. And then you just jump into like a menu, where basically into the, sorry, into the Mind Place, where you arrange all of the things you've been collecting around the environments, all your different clues onto this big board. And there's a lot of like spamming, like, oh, does this one go here?
There's like these sub-headages of like cult killings. And so does it go there? No.
Does it go into victim's body? And I'm just, I don't think it's easy to engage with it as a detective experience, but it's kind of trying to get you to think that way. But I don't think it's like, it handles that side of things that well.
And so-
It's very linear, that side of the game. Like I wouldn't call this a proper detective game by any like stretch of the imagination.
No, and so I think it actually, it's quite challenging to push through that a little bit, because the game is asking you to do something very specific and you just want to get on with it and find out what the story is, but you're constantly pausing and jumping into this other screen and trying to solve this thing. And I think that created some, and still is really creating some pacing issues with it. And I think like when it sort of got to the slightly weird Alan stuff, which does feel like it's where all the big ideas have gone is what's happened to Alan, what's going on in Alan's world.
Like a lot of the big sort of like, I suppose you might call horror set pieces have gone, seem to be happening to him, at least in what I've played so far. I think like when the saga action kicked off and then it's sort of like it emerged the game is basically original Alan Wake cross with Resi 2 remake. It's, you know, you write down to the font, it's very Resi 2 remake as well.
I think they, it feels like they've even lifted the interface. That's when it starts to click. I'm like, I don't think this is quite as good combat wise as Resi 2 remake.
I think that Capcom are just sort of in a league of their own with that stuff. But it's close enough and it's definitely better than the original Alan Wake, which is in its favor. And yeah, they seem to have like just more of a grasp on what it is.
It's maybe, it's got the potential to be less repetitive. But I mean, I guess you are further into it. You can speak to that.
But I think, yeah, it was just that opening where it's quite challenging pacing wise, but then it eventually finds its footing. And then you're like, oh no, I kind of get what they're doing with this now. And then you're flipping between the two different characters.
And that is quite stimulating as a player experience. So yeah, it's actually like getting to the point where it's clicking now. But did you have any of those sort of like teething issues or were you gonna just stray into it?
Oh no, this is pretty cool.
No, a little bit. I mean, I like the sort of, you know, I like very, you know, expensive, polished detective games. You know, even if the actual detective systems were pretty basic or non-existent.
So ticks that LA. Noire box of walking into a crime scene and just thinking like, well, what the hell's going on here? You know, like there's been a big ritual killing.
There's always like weird symbols. There's a body arranged in a weird way. You know, I like the theater of those moments in 3D crime games.
So that works for me. The weird thing about The Mind Place is I think it becomes more valuable or definitely makes more sense as the game goes on. Because as you start flipping between them, like the chapters are quite long.
You can spend quite a long time with Alan. Or you can literally, once you have the choice to switch between the two, you can pursue either storyline all the way to the end or alternate if you want. So in theory, you could leave Saga for 10 hours or whatever, and then come back and not have a clue what's going on.
And actually having this mechanic, which step by step talks you through every scenario, is quite handy as an inbuilt recap. So I value that system there. If anything, I kind of wish there was the equivalent of that in Alan's world, because I have been playing it, alternating.
I do one chapter as one, then I switch to the other. And whenever I go back, I'm always a little bit like, what the fuck was I doing? What's going on here?
And it doesn't help that it's all very surreal and shifting anyway. But that was something I was down on at the start, kind of understood as it went on, so less of a problem. Yeah, I don't know.
I have this nagging feeling like it's all going to be total nonsense, you know. I've played, I don't know, I'm probably like halfway, two thirds way through it now, and I'm enjoying it. And like, beat to beat, there's some interesting stuff.
It takes you to some really fun locations, particularly a saga, like some of the weird stuff that they've added around outside Bright Falls. It feels quite true to the first game, but sort of elevated in certain ways. There's a really good theme park area that you'll get to, which is quite cute.
But yeah, I couldn't tell you what's happening in the story. I just don't understand it. There's so many layers of sort of weird meta nonsense that I don't know.
I think maybe you're just meant to just enjoy the silliness of it and go along, but I imagine there'll be hour-long YouTube videos breaking all the law down and explaining what it all means. I mean, there was for the original. I was reading about the original and was like, God, most of this went over my head or, you know, I kind of eye-rolled my way out of it.
And there's a bit of that here too. And that puts like a natural cap, I think, on how much I can enjoy it. You know, just the sheer daftness of it all.
And, you know, just that. I just got a feeling it's like going nowhere or it's going to be like the end of the first one, like a big to be continued again.
Well, it's interesting because what I realized about Alan Wake the character is that I'd missed his company, that he is the ultimate good, bad hang. Like he's, because I just heard his voice again. And I'm like, oh, here he is.
What a preposterous man he is writing his stories that come to life or whatever. Like it just, what a ridiculous character he is. But it's such a distinctive voice as well.
I think it's Matthew Perretta, I think is the voice actor, very, very good. And like that just sort of really sort of jumps out. And I'm like, oh, yeah, I just remember like Alan Wake felt different enough to the games of the time in 2010 that I just found it incredibly endearing.
And here we are 13 years later and blockbuster games are arguably like have even less personality than ever. And Alan Wake 2 is a game where a ton of money has been spent to do something quite specific. And even if I think that adds just adds up to vibes, you know, just like, yeah, I think that's still worth it because the vibes of so well executed, like the, you know, whether it's a live action segments or just like the beautiful environmental design, the way things are lit, the animation on different on like the characters faces, just presentation is just is immaculate.
And so I think where I'm at, I'm going to enjoy the journey, but you are further into it than me. Do you think it's too long, Matthew, as someone who has been going at it a while?
Yeah, it's quite a lot. I'd say every individual chapter is about 20 minutes too long.
Right.
Like just when you feel like, oh, I've really seen this area and it's sort of done everything you can do. And then there'll just be like another couple of fights. And like there just isn't the enemy variety and there isn't the depth to the combat that you get in like, you know, a Resident Evil 4, say, you know, in terms of like the weapon evolution isn't quite interesting enough.
You know, there is character skills and weapon upgrades and that kind of stuff. Like it's a fuller game than Alan Wake 1, but it's still pretty shallow as far as that genre goes. And so, yeah, like it definitely sags.
But then every chapter so far has had one thing where I've been like, oh, I'm really glad I saw this location or, you know, it does some big kind of gimmicky set pieces. I think Simon alluded to like, that they have their version of like the Ashtray maze, like a big musical set piece. They have like an equivalent of that here.
And when that happens, it is really exciting. And you're like, oh, this is amazing. I'm having a great time.
But yeah, the Alan levels, particularly are like all a little bit too long. When you get into them, like, there's this hotel that they seem to go on forever. And it's just like stress.
It's just a constant level of stress and tension that it needs to be able to like let off, you know, just let go of it every once in a while. And it doesn't, yeah. So yeah, it's good.
I'm not quite feeling the nines and tens. I'll say on this one.
But got a big eight energy to me this one.
Yeah, but like, you know, that's still pretty great in this year, you know? Like that's fine. And it's super interesting.
It's a game I'd like recommend like most people play just to see like, look what Remedy are up to. Aren't they interesting in that kind of mainstream space? You know, I celebrate that creativity.
I just wonder if it's sort of gonna be a whole lot of nothing in the end, but we'll see.
Yeah, I sort of feel that way too, actually, as someone who actually spent 50 pounds on it. I feel like it's shown me things I haven't seen in another game this year, and therefore it's worth the cost of admission.
Right, right.
Yeah, so I will persist, Matthew, and see if it breaks my top 10 for the year. But yeah, it's an interesting little thing. Well, not little thing, because Epic spent loads of money on it.
But I thank them for their sacrifices. It's a good use of spying like Ant-Man skins or whatever people do in Fortnite. So I'm happy with that, nonetheless.
So Matthew, what about your first game here? What do you got for me?
I got Chants of Senaar, which is Run Disk's language puzzler. I can't remember why I started playing it. Well, I've seen, it came out a few months ago.
I'm not like ahead of the curve on this one at all. And I've heard, actually on the Discord, I think lots of people had mentioned it as a thing they'd enjoy. You are basically a masked figure climbing a tower where everyone speaks a language you don't speak.
And the central mechanic is figuring out that language so that you can figure out the various puzzles that stand in your way. That may be anything from just being able to understand the instructions you're being given to be able to solve a puzzle to more complicated stuff, like being able to read signs or riddles or... The actual, once you've got the language down, the actual puzzles themselves are pretty simple, but what's interesting here is how they've tackled this system of deciphering this symbol-based language.
And for me, it plays a slightly more satisfying version of Heaven's Vault, that inkle game, which was also about interpretation and translation of hieroglyphics. You're an archaeologist in some sort of weird space world. Did you play that back in the day?
No, but I do remember it being just universally celebrated. Quite complex, but people who got into it were like, this is one of the best games of the year, you know?
Yeah, it was great, but it was very highbrow. Almost like, it almost resisted being a game in a way that I don't think Chants of Senaar does. I think Chants of Senaar is happy having kind of quite firm answers.
So not a problem with Heaven's Vault, but one of its big threads was that, you know, all the points it was trying to make was that we will never truly understand these civilizations and that what we interpret is only that. It's an interpretation. You know, it was a game which refused to say, yes, this is the correct answer, where this game, like the language has a very hard and fast meaning and it has mechanics in place where you get basically get the opportunity to like bank a few symbols at the same time and like lock them in place so that you know that, yes, this symbol definitely means door, this symbol definitely means open.
Up until that point, whenever you see a symbol, you literally bring up like the PlayStation keyboard and type in what you think it means so that whenever you see it, it will then put that word on screen. So, you know, you might, you may see someone kind of say like, point to a gate and say something and you're like, well, I know the thing they're saying to me is probably like, open that gate or open that door. So you put down your interpretation of it and a bit later you'll lock it in and it'll go, yes, that word's open, yes, that word's door, and that's locked in.
So bit by bit, you're kind of like actually chipping away at the language in a way, which in Heaven's Vault, you never did. It was always a little bit like, well, you know, makes you think. And as someone who likes quite like black and white, right answers, wrong answers in games, like, yeah, I don't want to say Chants of Senaar is like Heaven's Vault for sort of dummies, because it's still like, I'd say any game, which is about deciphering a language system is reasonably highbrow.
But it's a version, it's like, it's highbrow for me. It's like, it's the difference between an A at GCC and an A star, you know?
Yeah, that's the best way of putting it.
I'm very, like, I'm happy surfing along at my A level, man, you know? That's fun, we're, you know, Johnny and Gold at or behind Heaven's Vault is, like, quite galaxy brained.
It's like, Catherine was a big Heaven's Vault person.
Yeah, yeah, and she's much smarter than I am, so. Yeah, that's basically, but yeah. Yeah, and if anything, she played the demo of this and was like, oh, it was a bit basic, so.
It's actually the perfect comparison. Yeah, yeah. And so, yeah, you go through this tower, you work out this thing.
What I really love is the way that, you know, almost in that kind of Obra Dini way, the way it sort of seeds what the language actually means. Like, sometimes you'll see someone, like, barking instructions at someone and someone else doing something. So you're like, well, I know the thing they're saying to them has to involve these kind of terms.
And, you know, and then you'll cross reference that with what someone says somewhere else and how someone reacts to that. And gradually you begin to kind of like work it all out. And, you know, when you finally do slot the symbols in and it goes, yes, this means that and that means this, that's very satisfying.
So I feel like it leaves you enough room to do some actual detective work, but also gives you that hard and fast, like, you know, you can start building out more answers from these correct answers. And as the game goes on and you ascend this tower, you're basically making your way through tiers of this society. And each tier has its own language system.
So just as you've mastered one place, you're suddenly in a place where you don't understand what the fuck anyone's talking about. And like, maybe there are similarities. Maybe you can see like how one set of symbols has evolved into the next, and you can start kind of drawing connections there.
But I think it's a really neat balance of like sort of the cerebral and the kind of, you know, the clean rules of a video game, which both of which appeal to me. So it's, I think it's pretty great actually. You know, drawn in this very nice sort of-
Mobius style?
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, very handsomely done.
Like quite, you know, it feels like quite, I've probably been playing for like six, seven hours. I'm not quite at the end yet. It's quite, you know, decent size, but every area, like when you finally crack the code and you work out like what people are saying, and then you get to go back through the level and like you understand everyone and you realize that the guy who seemed very threatening was actually saying something quite nice to you, or this, you know, guy who kind of like quite aggressively waved a fist at you was actually just cracking a gag about another character you'd met.
And there's like enough payoff for like deciphering this world. Yeah, it's a cool little thing. Really weird that like Focus published this game.
Like I don't really know where it fits in the grand scheme of things. Like it's not like, not really an indie game, but it's not obviously like, you know.
A Warhammer game.
Yeah.
Doesn't have rats in it either.
Doesn't have rats in it, not yet. Yeah, I've just, I've enjoyed it. It's been very sort of nourishing to play.
Yeah, yeah, it seems like, you know, it's quite a feat to be, you know, like, let's not use the word indie because that has become, you know, a bit of a lightning rod in recent weeks. But, you know, sort of mid-sized publishers, you know, one of their lower budgeted titles you would expect, right, based on the way it looks and feels. But like, to get the attention it's been getting, regardless of that, in this year, given how busy this year is, I think does speak to the fact that it is quite distinctive as a proposition and probably bringing the barrier down for understanding the language element of it is probably exactly why it's resonating with people, because you don't need that next level of clever clogs to really wrap your brain around it.
Yeah, I think the heritage is part of it. It is like an Obra dinner at its heart or a Golden Idol. And I think if you're into those kind of slightly more elevated investigative games, I think that will scratch that itch.
That's definitely how it works for me. But not about murders like those games are, but language. And you do feel like a little bit of a clever clogs when you're like, oh, whenever I see this dash on a symbol, that means it's like a plural of this, or this symbol, this element which is repeated in symbols means there's a person or there's a noun in there somewhere.
It's describing all the jobs start with like a horizontal line or whatever. And you begin to sort of see that, like it must have taken them fucking ages to nail what those system symbols was. But you do feel pretty good about yourself when you crack it.
Mm, good stuff. Well, I do have this on the old Epic Games press card. So I'll give it a whirl in the coming weeks, see how that goes.
You'll think it's a load of old wank.
No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I really like the art style, actually.
Like the movies thing jumped out at me because I just love games that look like that. It's still something that I've only, you only ever see it intermittently as like an influence in games and rarely done that well. So it's, yeah, appealing for sure.
Okay, so another big hitter, Matthew, for our next one, Super Mario Wonder.
Yes.
So yes, this game asks the question, if we talk about how the 3D land and 3D world games, right, basically translate 2D Mario into 3D. This basically translates 3D Mario into 2D. It's the idea onslaught 2D Mario.
And I'm a third of the way through it, Matthew. I've done the first two worlds, climbed that big mountain thing basically. And I kind of want to save the rest for Christmas because it feels like the ultimate Christmas game to me.
But it has been so easy to play, so delightful. The ideas are so good. Each level has basically its own idea.
What is the power up, Matthew, that basically sends Mario into his big, kind of like, I've taken a load of drugs kind of state? Because that's kind of like the vibe of it.
What's the wonder flower?
A wonder flower, right, because the wonder seeds are what you collect, right? Yeah, okay, so you basically find the wonder flower and then it changes something fundamental in the rest of the level, where basically the level will become a set piece of some kind. It's basically like a 2D Mario game that asks, what if we use a bag of tricks that we never used in 2D Mario before and did proper set pieces, things that you just couldn't build in a Mario Maker game, essentially.
It's just like the Nintendo hand of God at work, basically, and it's absolutely magic. I'm just really just blown away by how good it is. But I think because when it was announced, I know there was a good vibe from it because it looked a little bit more interesting than recent 2D Mario games have.
They've been a little bit flat and on a bit of a critical decline as well. It feels like the new Super Mario Bros, people were just like less and less impressed by that each time it popped up. This does feel like they've genuinely got out of their way to surprise players.
And there was like this kind of surprise element to every single level by love. You just don't know exactly what it's gonna throw up. Sorry to repeat a couple of my tweets there, Matthew.
No, no, no. They're good tweets.
Thank you. But I think it's just delightful and a shock straight up to one of my favorites of the year. How do you feel about it?
Yeah, I mean, I think when you know the people involved in this, and I think we talked about this before, but it's the producer on this game is, or has been the lead producer on 3D Mario. So it's the guy who was the, he directed Mario Galaxy 2, he directed 3D Land, and then produced Super Mario Odyssey. They basically took him from EAD Tokyo or whatever that studio is now called, and put them as the producer on this.
And yeah, if you read the interviews, he applied the process, which was the thought process behind Galaxy and 3D Land to a 2D Mario. And lo and behold, it makes, yeah, another absolute sort of platforming dazzler. You know, it has exactly the same rhythm of Galaxy, of like anything can happen in the next level.
You're always excited to see what it is, you know, comes up with mechanics, brilliant mechanics, enemy types, transformations, you know, level furniture gimmicks, and then just instantly sort of throws them away and it's on to the next. His system, by the way, is really no more complicated than everyone on the team puts loads of ideas on like a thousand Post-It notes, and then they prototype all of them and just keep the best ones. Like he's often talked about this Post-It note system and they can be anything, you know.
What I like about it is some of them are mechanical twists, you know, like, you know, the Mario transformations or, you know, a certain sort of enemy as vehicle or, you know, something along those lines. And then sometimes the gimmick might just be a gag, you know, it might be, you know, a lot of plants are gonna sing a funny song and you don't really do anything. You'll just kind of walk along listening to this funny song or what happens if, you know, the Mario pipes will come alive and start wiggling around.
Like it doesn't really mean much, but you're like, oh, okay, well, I've not seen that before. That was funny. But then sometimes there are mechanics, but you're like, I could play a whole game at that.
You know, like there's a few levels which revolve around like rhythm and things only happening if Mario like jumps on the beat. And that's almost like a sort of Necrodancer type thing. Or there'll be, you know, I mean, God, and there's so like, if anything, it's so rich in ideas that you will have forgotten hundreds of them, like at any given time.
It almost has that Uncharted 3 thing where every level had so many like big set pieces. You only remembered like two bits of the game at the end. Cause you were like, oh, my brain, I can't actually hold this many stuff.
Especially things that only happen for like 10 seconds. Like, and that's maybe like, I wouldn't say that's like ever a negative, but you know, there are maybe moments where I've been like, I could have played like a lot more of that one thing. Or, you know, like some of, you know, 20 of these levels are extraordinary compared to the hundred, which are like merely very good.
And I made, you know, what if they drilled down deeper into the extraordinary rather than just throwing stuff away so rapidly. I also find it, and I think you've said this about one of the 3D Marys in the past. I actually, I find it a little bit exhausting.
Like I can't play it for more than like an hour, because after an hour, you've seen so much weird shit in this game that I'm like, I become sort of slightly dull to it in a way that I have to kind of step away, kind of go back to my boring life, kind of reset, remember what it is to be normal, and then come back and kind of get pulled through this sort of mad hedge backwards again. It's just, it's like almost busy to a fault. Yeah, yeah.
It's funny, because I was on a train journey, I started at 6.30 the other day, and I booted this at like 7 a.m. And guess what? It's too fucking early for Mario Wonder at 7 a.m.
When you've had about six hours sleep, it was not the one dog. So yeah, that is true. And I think that's why it's best played in bursts and you shouldn't use it up too fast, because again, you don't know how long it'll be till they make another one, right?
That's always the thing with Mario games. So there's that part of it. But I do also think that yeah, like the world experimentation means that not every idea works as well as others, like you say, but to just live in them for like 30 seconds is all you need, really.
Like it's, the one that stands out to me, actually, is the one where it goes top down, where basically like-
Oh, yeah, I know, but that's like, that's like galaxy, mad galaxy shit, I love that, yeah.
Yeah, I know, but I really love that too. And like I did, I wasn't there thinking I'd love to play a whole game of this, but basically you get the Wonderflower, and then like there's this sort of like, there's a particular sort of like blue background in this level that basically becomes the playing space for when you're walking around top down in this playing space, dodging enemies and stuff. And I was like, that is fucking amazing.
When it was over, I just felt like, wow, just well done. Well done on the execution of this, just for like, you know, basically like, yeah, 30 seconds to 45 seconds. Really, really good.
So man, what a treat. What an absolute treat. And I absolutely underestimated this.
And then I saw the reviews and I was like, oh shit. Okay, I guess this is like, you know.
I think a lot of people did. Like it's, you know, but I think that's more to do with just 2D Mario has been so conservative for so long. And like Nintendo, like it feels like they've not had to do anything interesting with it because they've all sold quite well because it's traditional Mario.
It's Mario as most of the public know it, is New Super Mario Brothers. So actually to take it and go, oh no, we're going to do something like really, really out there with it. And yeah, it's, you know, I always over rely on these Nintendo interviews, but I do find them fascinating.
You know, like you get a sense of some of these people from having read interviews with them in a utter ass over the years and seeing like people who have long been associated with 2D Mario really energized by this new approach and by like Mr. 3D Mario basically coming in and going, it's okay for us to go like fucking crazy on this. Like even Koji Kondo, the composer, who can sometimes be, you know, like he's been around for so long and you know, he's just sort of churning out the sort of same old stuff again and again. You know, he was talking about like all the mad bullshit he was suggesting for the game and like some, a lot of it didn't make the cut because his stuff was just too weird.
Like turns out Koji Kondo is like a mad freak. And like that I love. There was stuff in that interview about how one of the pitches was the whole game was going to have a commentary over the top of it.
Like that was one of the gimmicks suggested. Like there'd be sports commentators and that actually got boiled down to the flowers that are in the game now, who kind of pass comment on you as you go by. Cause they were like, it was too much to have just a mad voice barking at you for the whole game.
So instead we'll have these flowers that like, I quite like, I mean, they're dumb as hell, but like something amazing will happen. And then there'll inevitably be a flower there who'll go like, wow, that was crazy. And I'm like, it sure was.
You know, like they often speak exactly how I'm feeling. So I like them.
Sometimes they're like, that was a hard one or whatever. And you're like, yep, it was good commentary. They're funny because I think they take a tiny bit of a climatizing because they're not something you've encountered in other Mario games.
And the voice is a little bit, I don't know, it doesn't sound very Nintendo-y to me as a voice. So there's a bit of a, yeah, climatizing to that too. But yeah, I agree.
It's a nice touch. You know, it sounds like they had the right amount of restraint there in terms of implementing that idea. So that's good.
But it's really good. I mean, there's a lot of discussion around this game and difficulty and whether, basically it's a lack of difficulty matters. If you're having this kind of fun and it's throwing all this mad stuff.
And maybe that speaks to the stuff I was saying earlier where you think, oh, maybe I'd like to see what the hard version of each of these levels is. This mechanic has enough nuance to it to put Mario through his paces. I'd love to actually have to master some of these things.
Mastery isn't really this game's deal. It's more about just go with the crazy flow. And it's introducing you to so many ideas so quickly that it almost, it feels like they feel like they can't push it too far because they can't tutorialize anything properly because you're just there and you're like, it's almost that WarioWare thing of like, oh, right, everything's a bit slow.
Okay, I'll do that now. And like, oh, in this level, it's all upside down. Or like, now I'm a ball, or now I'm floating around, or now I'm walking backwards or whatever.
And they feel like, well, it would ruin the moment if it was then a fucking nightmare to actually do this. Like, it feels like they're willing you to the flagpole at the end of every level. But that's, you know, there have been loads of hard games this year, so who cares, right?
Yeah, and there are some levels that are notably harder. Like, they demarcate where the difficult levels are. And so you get some of that stimulation, even if you're not necessarily getting it across the entire game.
So yeah, I think it balances out okay. This is also just like, this is just the level of experience I am personally looking for at the moment. I think that's okay.
And also, some of the optional, what is the equivalent of the stars, the red stars you get in this one, like the purple 10 coin things that you can get? They're actually quite fucking hard to get. So, I'm not saying that necessarily adds like a mastery level to it, but you do have to kind of come back to those, I think, to really understand how to get all of them.
Plus there's the element where you basically have loadouts for Mario now, because he has these little badges, right? So they add kind of like different abilities too. Are they badges?
Is that the term they use, Matthew?
Yeah, yeah, they're badges. They sort of like give you like a floaty jump or a better kick when you're under water or things like that. So you're meant to like match them to the levels to...
I bet you can pull off some like mad shit if you match the right badge to the right level.
Definitely, but that again is just another layer of ideas they've added, right? Because they're like, okay, for this level, we want you to just be able to do this one thing. And so we're gonna give you the power to do that.
And that's not something that previous TD Mario games have done. So I don't know, I think that, I think it's got plenty of longevity in it. I don't think it's like, certainly got as much longevity in it as the 3D, the 3D Land and World games.
Like it's about as hard as those, I would say. And that's okay. I think for me, that's, you know, it does the trick.
Yeah, it has some of the same, I wouldn't say problems, but like, you know, one of my complaints with the 3D Land and World games, and I apologize to long-term listeners of this podcast, because I'm going to sound like a broken record here, but, you know, I felt like those games had a slight issue with escalation in that, like a level would introduce an idea, escalate it a little bit, and then it would be over just as you mastered it. And I think the same would be true here, except that like in this sort of, you know, this sort of three act structure, which Nintendo have talked about in the past in relation to the Galaxy games. The weird thing about Wonder is that a level will have its own gimmick and it will introduce it.
You'll probably spend like a minute in that mechanic. So like there's this weird enemy type, you know, there's loads of balls running around and you have to jump over them or whatever. But then when you get to the third act, which is normally where that idea would really ramp up and test you, that's where you have the Wonderflower and the level becomes an entirely different level.
So it's quite odd in that sense, you know, like maybe I'd like to see what those levels look like without the Wonderflower perhaps, or I haven't quite kind of unpicked that thought, but I think there's something interesting there, which is why this isn't quite like the galaxy of 3D games for me. You know, it is merely a brilliant 2D Mario game, and how lucky are we to finally get one of those after a long, long time, but is it like, you know, it's not like 10 territory for me.
No, but it is, I think it's firmly nine territory based on what I've played so far. Like it's, that's what it feels like to me anyway, but.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I want to sort of finish it and sort of see it through. I'm about two thirds of the way through, and it is brilliant.
Like it's like even like Mario's movement is amazing in the game and like the use of sound to like mark his acrobatics. Like there's like a little kind of guitar sort of strum when he jumps and when he does a butt slam, there's like a little tsh, tsh, like a little drum roll with a sort of cymbal clash.
And it feels, yes, it sounds and feels delightful to play in a way that the new Mario games just were so kind of mechanically conservative in that way.
Yeah, I knew they were never good, Matthew. I knew they were never good.
It's not that they're not good, you know, they are like, they're much harder games than the new Mario games, I think, than this. I was terrible and you see from around as the Wii U one was quite tough and the Luigi spinoff was a fucking nightmare again.
The ones before that were quite gentle, weren't they?
Yeah, the DS ones were definitely gentler. Yeah, the other interesting thing about this one is, and this isn't their original thought, like I've definitely seen other people say this, but it really reminds me of Rayman Legends in lots of ways. Like Rayman Legends also had that quite richness of imagination.
You know, it had, you know, maybe just because there are some musical levels, very different style of musical levels in Wonder, but that puts me in mind of Rayman. But also like the even the animated style on it, like where it's sort of 3D, but slightly hand drawn, so looks quite cartoony. You know, Nintendo never, you know, they claim to sort of exist in this sort of bubble where they don't react to other people's work, but there's a bit more of that kind of like slapstick comic energy of Rayman in this one.
Like it's quite daft, like a lot of the enemy designs are like a number of new enemies for one. Like there's so many more enemy types in this than there's been in a 2D Mario for years. And they're very like, they remind me of Rayman enemies, like the big balls and these weird sort of strange, multicolored animals with big bulging eyes.
They're very reminiscent of that, but like I say, not an original thought.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep playing it as well, Matthew, and kind of see how I feel about it by the end. And I think, yeah, again, I'm just gonna like take my time with it and not burn through all those ideas too quickly, because like I say, when it's gone, it's gone, but also it's just, it is nice to savor it and stop and think about it a little bit. It's like the perfect hour at a time game, basically.
So yeah, and I would like to play it with someone as well in Co-op, that is something I would like to try. That's another part of the game too. I can't imagine it adds much, you know what I mean?
But it feels very tailored for a single player experience because of the set piecey nature of it. But I'd like to try it. Some of the set pieces would be fun in multiplayer, like when the level starts turning basically completely, like in the entire land below you is like just spinning around and you just have to kind of like keep hopping over objects to avoid being like thrown into the abyss.
Like that sort of stuff could be good in four players. So yeah, yeah, good stuff.
I also wanted to ask very quickly where you stand on the new Mario voice.
I barely even notice really, to be honest. Like it's a bit of a shrug from me. Do you have strong feelings on it?
No, not really.
There you go. RIP Charles Martinet.
Or slightly throatier. There's certain sounds where you're like, oh yeah, that's a different guy.
Yeah. I don't really get why that was such a big deal, why they made a big deal about it while it was like, here's the going away celebration for Charles Martinet, or it felt like he was being put in some kind of cupboard. Very bizarre.
It was like an undertaking for Nintendo that. I don't know if it needed a big deal. They might as well just change it and not told anyone, and then people can notice afterwards and be like, oh, that sounds a bit weird.
Oh, they replaced him. Oh, okay, fine. Let's move on.
Anyway, so Matthew, another of your games here. A sequel to one of your unexpected favorites. So, yeah, what's the deal here?
The Talos Principle 2, a 3D puzzle game set in, well, I was going to say set in abstract mazes. Not so much. It's kind of a different one to neatly sum up of a Talos Principle, because it's a puzzle game, but it doesn't really revolve around a central puzzle mechanic in the style of a portal, say.
It's not a game where every puzzle is built out from one central idea. It's a game with quite a lot of puzzle types, a lot of them slightly old fashioned, like pressure pads or bouncing light beams to hit special light switches. Things which you've probably seen like a million times in lots of other games which have dabbled in smaller versions of these puzzles.
This just does a lot more complicated versions of them and sort of blows them out. In the first game you were in this simulated world solving room upon room of these sort of slightly abstract sort of physics-y puzzles, I guess. And you should play that game, it's very good.
So I won't spell it out exactly what happens. But where that game ends sort of births a new world which The Talos Principle 2 is set inside. This is now the real world, it's no longer a simulated world.
So this instantly has the benefit of being more traditionally beautiful. It's still puzzle chambers but they're embedded in these almost halo-like sci-fi landscapes, these big green valleys or strange mountaintops with little kind of weaving paths. It's a huge visual step up, it's like the AAA version of Talos Principle 1 and for that reason I think it instantly becomes a little bit more accessible because it just looks like a more traditionally pretty video game place that you'd want to explore using modern hardware to create some pretty spectacular vistas and where the first game communicated a lot through audio diaries and a booming voice of a god figure in that world and computer terminals, the world you've stepped into at the end of Talos Principle 1 has a lot of other robots in it, you play a robot I should say, there are loads of other robots in it, so there are characters you are meeting, talking with, and for that reason it feels like they've just taken the core idea of puzzle rooms from the first game but dressed it up in the trappings that I think most people would expect from most sort of story puzzle adventure games, you know, there's a prettier world, there are other people for you to meet, there aren't I mean, it's not like side quests or such, but there are more regular side activities.
So it feels a lot more welcoming to gamers who expect worlds to behave like this. Does that make sense?
Sort of. This is quite a hard game to get your head around generally. Because I think them going down the route of, it's set for the first one, a lengthy puzzle game from nine years ago.
It's actually quite a hard proposition up front.
Yeah, but that's their thing. It's technically set a thousand years after the first game. And in that time, basically in that time, what was a very abstract world has become a much more recognizable reality.
And so as a result of that, it is like more interesting, more accessible. It has the kind of sort of veneer of accessibility that the first one maybe didn't have. The first one was like, you are in a weird fucking pyramid doing like lots of like bouncing puzzles.
This one is you're in this beautiful forest doing, you know, a better variety of puzzles. So I didn't very elegantly sum that up, but I just think if you put both of them in front of most people, most people would go, oh, well, this one looks like something I'd actually play because it has people I can talk to and it has like more of an obvious story. It still has the same like big ideas and you know, it's absolutely packed with like sort of philosophy and myth and historical ideas, but they're just, they're packaged in a much friendlier way.
Like it feels like a big, it's never gonna push that far into the mainstream, but it feels like a much more mainstream game to me. And it's probably like a better hang because of that. Also, it just has a much greater variety of puzzles.
So it starts off with the, you know, very recognizable lights bouncing puzzles, but then it will introduce like a machine which kind of bores holes in the wall, a bit like a portal machine. So suddenly solid walls have holes in them. You can shoot light through those.
You can pass objects through those. And you'll have a world which revolves around that. And then in the next world, there'll be a machine which you have to pump different colored light in to produce other colored light to solve puzzles.
And then in the next world, it'll layer in. Now there are other robots that you can kind of project your conscious into and you're now playing like... Oh, what was that 2D game?
Not the Splitter. What was it called?
The Swapper.
The Swapper. It's like now in this world, it kind of plays like the Swapper for a bit. And in the Portal world, it plays a little bit like Portal for a bit.
And it just, it feels like bigger in every way, like way more ideas, a much faster like turnaround of those ideas, still has the ultra difficult kind of like almost witness level kind of hidden puzzles, like the meta puzzles there for the people who really like dug that stuff in the first game. But it also, it has a more obvious path through the game for the more casual player. And I think that strikes a nicer balance.
You know, I guess for me, what I like about The Talos Principle, and particularly the sequel is, you know, I find a lot of puzzle games, while mechanically very sophisticated, they're often so sort of reduced or like abstract in their sort of visuals that, you know, I just get like bored of looking at the same thing, you know, over like an hour and I have to step away from it. And so I've bounced off stuff, which is probably more sophisticated than this. But like, this strikes that balance of like, there's enough to the puzzles, but there's also like, there's enough like pretty graphics, really, it's like me.
You know, it's a bit like Chants of Senaar with Heaven's Vault again, you know, it's kind of, it's very smart, but not too smart, you know? It's just smart enough, it's the perfect Goldilocks puzzle game.
But it goes down smooth because it looks so nice.
Yeah, and you're just like, oh, this is really nice. This just, this looks like, again, that sounds crude. It looks like a modern video game, you know?
It cares about presentation a lot more than the first game did.
Yeah, it looks quite big budget, I would say. Like, just deceptively so. Like, it's a very shiny looking thing.
So, because obviously that first game landed, you know, right when indie games were massively taking off, right? And probably everyone, there was probably a weekend when nothing else came out and everyone hoovered it up and played through it. And so, years later, they probably thought, well, if we're gonna do a sequel, we might as well go all out.
So, yeah.
The first one is like explicitly built from assets from Serious Sam. And that was weird about it. It's like you're in a Serious Sam level, except instead of like 10,000 demons, there's a load of crates and pressure switches.
And you're like, oh, okay. This one is like, you know, it isn't that. It's clearly like moved along.
And yeah, it's again, like very nourishing. Like even if you don't like fully click with all the big ideas, it's gonna like introduce you to concepts or talk to you about things which you haven't really considered. You know, and I'm not like a student of philosophy.
I'm far too basic for that. But there's like enough of it where I'm like, oh yeah, that is true. That is an interesting idea.
As I, you know, stick another fucking fistful of starburst into my mouth.
You make yourself sound, yeah, sound more inferior than you actually are, actually, Matthew. So, yeah.
It's like, you're right. Oh, man kind of is like a machine as I glug down my fucking second bottle of Dr. Pepper.
Yeah, you're sort of like a croque monsieur studied with Renny, basically.
Right.
No, no, I think honestly the number one barrier to people playing this this year is that it is a sequel to a game that you might not have played at the time. And if you want to play that sequel, then that is a long ass play through. Like it's not going to be a short experience.
And so, and then you have that old sort of sequel anxiety of, do I just jump straight in? And I know it is built for that, basically. But you know what I mean?
It's something that people will probably, it'll probably be a boundary for some people.
Yeah, the tagline for the game is the past is prologue, which it's almost like, I read that as them saying, well, the first game is like, almost like a prequel. You know, like play this game, and then you could play the first game to find out how like this interesting story actually kicked off. Like it works very hard to introduce you specifically to this world.
You know, like the first game is ancient history, by the time you've turned up here, you know, this almost has like, the start of this is almost like a Fallout game, like the way you enter the world and like who you are and the amount of time that's passed from the first game. Like it's not just hand waving it away and going, that was nothing, like that's still there and it will deepen your appreciation of this. But I, you know, it's been a long time since I played The Talos Principle 1 and I didn't feel like there was anything where I had to like wiki it, you know, compared to fucking Alan Wake, where I had to watch like 10 YouTube videos just to understand like who I'm talking to at any given moment, you know?
Oh God, I'm doing a lot of that for control characters in that I'm like, was this guy, was this Finnish sounding guy in like control? I can't remember, so there's a lot of that going on.
Artie the janitor.
Yeah, well him I remembered obviously, but there was those guys fixing that little hut near the lake and I was like.
I think they're new for it.
Right, yeah. But again, deep dives, sort of like Wiki recesses.
Actually, that's reminding me another thing I actually really like about Alan Wake 2 is have you got to any of the rooms with Shaun Ashmore in them?
Yes, yes. Tim Breaker, my guy.
Basically, like their version of Resident Evil save rooms where you'd go in and they're bathed in a warm light and it plays a nice bit of music is that occasionally you're in a very scary place and you'll go into a room and there's just nice Shaun Ashmore in there and you're like, oh, well, this isn't right. Shaun Ashmore's here. He is kind of the evil within Claire de Lune.
It's like, if you can hear Shaun Ashmore, you know that you're gonna be safe in a moment.
Yeah, he's even humming as well. It's like you might as well be going, do, like the Resi 4 sort of safe music. He might as well be doing that.
That's, yeah, Tim Breaker, my guy.
Tim Breaker.
Okay, so Matthew, my last thing I was gonna discuss was, I was gonna talk a bit about Spider-Man, but we're gonna leave that for another episode because there will be another chance to talk about that this year. So I bought an Oculus Quest 3. I thought I'd discuss that a little bit because you and I like the odd sort of folly hardware purchase on this podcast, don't we?
So it was my turn to buy one. And I tend to buy one big hardware thing a year, whether it's like the Xbox Series X or, oh, well, I suppose I also bought the Steel Battalion controller this year. So that is still in the cupboard.
It will come out at some point. But yeah, I thought I'd buy this because I got, I would say like a reasonable amount of use out of my Oculus Quest 2. And I thought, okay, well, I'll sell that one on Facebook to some rando in a car park who hopefully won't knife me.
He didn't, by the way, listeners. So good news for everyone involved. Although he did test it when he was like, he got out of his van and then put it on.
And that was really strange. I felt like I was in some kind of way. I felt like I was in Westworld or something.
It was all wrong. So I bought this one. So the kind of like, the proposition with it is, is that they're trying to go for a bit more of an AR thing because the front facing camera on the Oculus Quest 2 was quite naff.
It was like black and white, very rudimentary, essentially just to sort of scan your surroundings. This time they put, I would say like a proper color camera on the front, but it's not that crisp. It's a very like blurry feed.
It feels like you're playing a Resident Evil game or something like Resi 7 where it's blurry in first person. But the idea is you can navigate the space around your home a bit more clearly because obviously you have this front facing camera and you can see what's going on at all times. That's cool.
But at the same time, the whole thing with the Quest hardware is a standalone VR. So they've made a little bit more powerful up the resolution of the display. And yeah, generally speaking, it's a bit more capable of more powerful experiences.
But it's been a slightly odd one because they kind of launched it with no games, which is bold, I would say. So I think what was supposed to happen was that their big game for the year is basically Asgard's Wrath 2, which is kind of like this RPG action game, sort of like hybrid. And it's a sequel to one of their most acclaimed Oculus Rift games on PC.
And it does work sort of standalone VR completely, but that's not out till mid-December. I suspect it was supposed to originally release with the hardware to show off. But they've got that.
There's a remake of the game The Seventh Guest, which is a big My Dad, Kev Roberts favorite. He was massively into that. So they've done that.
Before he entered into the saboteur, he loved The Seventh Guest. It's a big dad game, really, The Seventh Guest, wasn't it? Like CD-ROM kind of nonsense from the 90s.
So there's that. There's N Dreams has made like a Ghostbusters game. I've not played that, but that's, I think that got like okay reviews, I'm not sure.
Yeah, I've seen that in action. It was pretty smart, I thought.
Yeah.
If you can get the four mates who also have VR, which is always the challenge.
Yeah, absolutely. But they've given it, as ever with N Dreams, they put a bit of bank into making the games look good and feel good. So that's good.
And so you've got that. And yeah, that's sort of it for now. But there's also an Assassin's Creed game called Nexus.
That's out next month. I really fucking wanna play that. That looks pretty good.
That's basically like a best of compilation of previous Assassin's Creed games, condensed down to first-person bits. Now, the idea of jumping around in Assassin's Creed-o vision in first-person does sound like it'll make you throw up in a VR headset, but that's the sort of thing. It looks so good in the trailers they've put out, because it looks like they've got intricate first-person sword combat and stuff, and assassinations, and jumping between rooftops.
And I think I would really dig that. And so that has the potential to make the use of the hardware.
I hope they have a scene where, like, I hope the Assassin's Creed 3 bit is you just go and sit on a tree trunk and have a sulkers corner. Just a little sulk in the forest.
No, what they should do is they should do the boats in first person. They should do that, like cannibals flying past and shit, that'd be good. But yeah, so that's quite interesting, like a sort of pastiche approach to the Assassin's Creed series.
I definitely want to play that. But what it means is they've launched with nothing, basically, except for updates for games you might already have. So they've done an update, I think, they did one for Beat Saber, obviously, which is probably the most popular game on the platform, music lightsaber game.
They're doing one for The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, which is one of the favored sort of like light gun-y sort of shooter survival horror games, and there's a few more they're working on. But the big one that people have been talking up is this game called Red Matter 2, which is kind of like the sci-fi exploration thing. I played it only a little bit, but that has, I would say, some quite amazing visuals considering the limits of the hardware is this sort of like stand-alone VR thing.
It's actually pretty impressive, it's like looking at cool sci-fi shit in really crisp vision and realizing that if people actually do spend a bit of money making this stuff look good, the hardware can just about support it. Like it's definitely not PS VR 2 in terms of what it can achieve, but I always think that the dream of VR is the stand-alone VR experience. I think if you can nail that, that's going to work.
There's some version of your favorite game Pavlov, Matthew, that they're doing called Pavlov Shack.
That's the idea of you standing alone in your apartment, shooting yourself in the head.
That's got big Travis Bickle 2023 energy, hasn't it? That's a bit dark, I would say.
I think about that all the time, but that's genuinely changed me.
So I'm not sure what the difference is between Pavlov Main and Pavlov Shack. I mean, the word shack is quite off-putting, I would say, but it just means that you have to basically to find things that make the use out of this new hardware you've bought, that cost you about 300 to 500 quid, depending on which model you get. Basically means you just have to find a menu that says updated for Quest 3 or to go on to Reddit and see who's working on updates for Quest 3.
It's actually quite DIY and weird for a new hardware launch. It feels like they should have gone, actually, here's our big new game. PSVR 2, however you feel about it, Horizon, Call of the Wild, whatever it was, something like that.
Call of the Mountain, that was it. That was a killer app. It was maybe not something you would play for more than a few hours, but it shows you what the hardware was capable of.
That is kind of what you're after with VR. You want something that's big and shiny to show off the thing you've bought. To launch without one is weird, but the Oculus hardware experience remains immaculate.
I think it's just one of my favorite pieces of kit ever, just the menus and also those menus looking even nicer now, even crisper, works really well. I think when Asgard's Wrath 2 gets here, if that game actually does stand up, then it's a good kickoff point because the rumor is they've got a Batman VR game they're working on, they've got a bunch of different studios they own. There's some stuff they could probably port from Rift to Quest, if they're inclined and this hardware could support it.
But the slight problem with it is because it's backwards compatible with all Oculus Quest 2 games. It's maybe not an incentive for many VR devs to go back and make their games look prettier because you might sell a few more copies, but you are dependent on people discovering your old game versus just buying a new one. So in some ways, I think if the phone kind of like approach they've taken to iteration with this hardware might be bad for it.
I don't know if you have any thoughts on that, because I know you're not really tuned into that ecosystem.
No, not at all, but I am like fascinated by your ongoing relationship with it. I mean, yeah, it's hard to say, because I don't know what the limits are. Do you think it could play something like Resident Evil Village or is that like beyond it?
I think it's beyond it unless they scale it back. It's probably knocking on the door of it though. But again, because there aren't like games that actually show off what it can fully do.
You feel like you're actually not quite sure of the limits of it. So it's possible, maybe. I think they could like have a run at it.
But yes, it's in that ambiguity space. I don't know if it's quite as capable of doing PS4 level visuals.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, my relationship with VR is mainly being wowed by the more traditional games which have kind of translated in like the Resident Evil update, you know.
I'm really looking forward to the 4 VR update they do. I thought Capcom did a really, really good job with Village with PSVR 2 and like, you know, you know, the Gran Turismo getting in the cars and everything. And they just have like raw graphics on their side and I've kind of, I've just dabbled less with, you know, your more abstracted virtual worlds where, you know, we're sort of shoot lots of shooting galleries, lots of rhythm games, lots of things where I have to like duck under very fast moving bars and things like that, which is just, I'm just too old for.
I'm just too fucking unfit to play VR. That's the reality of it. That's why I haven't played my PSVR too much is because I've just, it just makes me very aware of what a terrible state my body's in.
I had to get on my haunches while playing like Beat Saber recently to do some fucking, I don't know, like Linkin Park, Jay-Z, Namonkor, bullshit and did, got on my haunches and thought there's a chance, like 5% chance I may never be able to stand up again, I guess. And that's the kind of like stage of life I've entered at 35 is it's just that it's more precarious than it was. So I totally get you.
Sometimes as well, like it'll be like, this is a comfortable VR experience. You put it on and then it's like, I need you to move sideways really quickly. And I'm like, that's not as easy as you think it is for me, you know?
So yeah, I totally get you on that. It's a funny one. But yeah, what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep an eye on what's coming out.
I'm definitely going to get hold of Assassin's Creed Nexus. I'm definitely going to get hold of Asgard's Wrath 2, Matthew, because that comes free with the headset if you buy it before January or something. So that's cool at least.
You get it as a pack-in basically, is the killer app. So I will play those and I will report back. But it's one of the strangest like soft launches for a hardware, piece of hardware I can remember because yeah, like it's just want to make Beat Saber look crisper.
Sure, I guess so. But yeah, there's probably more work to be done, but I will nonetheless pursue it. So yeah.
You have one last thing to talk about, right Matthew?
Yeah. Only very short because it's the one I've played the least amount of. I just wanted to put in a few words about Persona 5 Tattica.
Have you been following this at all?
Yeah. So I'm fascinated by the ever expanding roster of Persona 5 games and wondering what they're doing with each one. But this is basically like a turn-based tactics game, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Basically exactly that.
It has a few neat ideas of its own. Like the way it's folded in some of the Persona rules. So you have characters with gun attacks, sword attacks, and the magic spells that they get from their Personas.
But you can also, you amass Personas at the end of battle. You don't capture them on the field. They're kind of given to you on these kind of cogs.
And you can kind of fuse them to make new Personas. And then you can assign a sub-Persona to every character, which both boosts your stats and gives you moves. So it maintains some of the monster collecting element of the main game in that you can still create these like mad hybrids, which kind of keep the moves from both parents and let you do all kinds of wild stuff.
So like individually, your characters can be quite interesting on the battlefield. And it also has the thing in Persona 5 where, you know, when you knock down an enemy and then you get another go to extend your turn, that's like a thing here. Like if you can push an enemy out into the open and shoot them when they've got no cover, they'll fall down and then you get another go.
And, you know, I'd say at the heart of most sort of turn based tactic games that I like are mechanics where you can stretch moves for like impossible lengths and end up doing like 15 things in a turn. I don't know if this has that flexibility, but it has systems in place. It has quite interesting...
Do you remember the all out attacks in Persona 5?
Oh, yeah, of course.
If you downed like everyone, you could basically like bundle on everyone all at once. This has sort of that. When a single enemy is downed, if you can position yourself that that enemy is in the middle of a triangle between you and your other two party members, you can do an all out attack.
But as long as there's one enemy down and they're in that triangle, that move will activate and it will hurt any other enemies. So in theory, if you put your entire party over a whole battlefield, you could do an all out attack on the whole battlefield.
That seems a bit OP, doesn't it?
Well, yeah, I mean, it's quite unlikely that they'd be that spread out. Like the game's quite fast paced. Like there's like big rewards for completing each battle in like five turns.
So it isn't like very slow kind of XCOM mind games. It's about like pushing forwards, really like mulching through the enemies. That's the read on the early hours anyway.
But I do I do find it interesting that there is this positioning, extra powerful like positioning move and that the three of you, like there is a reward for keeping you apart, which is where they're most vulnerable, you know, because you're not there to kind of back each other up and kind of look out, you know, keep an eye on each other's backs or whatever. So that's that's kind of interesting that they have tried to do something new. The problem with this game is it's got this like it's got this like chibi art style, which I absolutely hate.
It's powerfully uncool for a Persona 5 game. Like the character art, like the fonts, the menus, it just feels really naff. Like it is not, you know, these games are like, their style and substance, this has like no style whatsoever.
Even like the text boxes just don't look right. Like the fonts they use, the way they've animated, just the shape of the text boxes, like instantly, like from the second one of those things pops up, you're like, oh dear, this doesn't look right. And I looked it up and it's made by, it's like made in-house, it's P Studio, it's the Persona Studio who are making it.
I just don't know what's happened. So I've made something like this lame from this license.
Yeah, it's quite an ugly looking thing in some ways.
Yeah, and I don't want to be like, oh, it looks like a mobile game, like very lazy criticism, but it does kind of look like it's so graphically simple and the battlefields are quite small and linear. It feels like, was this a mobile game at some point? Did this have, was it some mad, very fast paced take on mobile tactics and it's been turned into this fuller game?
But it's depressing. It's like this game, that's such a key part of its DNA is that it's much cooler than you are. Like it's meant to be.
You're meant to look at it and feel bad about yourself. But there are these fucking awesome teenagers doing all this cool shit. And this, you're like, well, I think I am cooler than this.
That's not right. It's like, it kind of adds up to quite a bad hang.
Yeah, so I think that the chibi character designs, like they are contentious, but I think the environments look genuinely bad. But they are, they're just very, very simple, because obviously they're set in this kind of like alternate universe kind of place.
It's like all set in like a, what feels like one of the Persona mind palaces, you know?
Yeah, and so it looks a bit off brand Persona anyway, because it doesn't have any sort of like, you know, verve or personality to the location. It just, there's a lot of like environments that just have barrels and like wooden fences stacked around. So it just looks a bit wrong.
Yeah, I can see what you mean.
In the dialogue scenes, the backgrounds are just like these quite crude 2D illustrations of like Cafe LeBlanc. And you're like, I have such fondness for that place. And it looks terrible.
It looks like if I drew the Cafe LeBlanc what it would look like, it's, I just don't, oh, it's so wrong. I just don't know what happened. I don't know, like, you'd think that would be like a brand pillar you'd protect above anything.
Is that, it has to be stylish as fuck. And this is, oh.
It's bizarre. It's bizarre because it's weird watching Persona be in this place where it's being, like, franchised. Because I still think of it as the oddball RPG series that blew up on PS Vita.
The one thing that did blow up on PS Vita was Persona 4 Golden and nothing else did. And now, Persona is such big business that it's on Game Pass. There are, like, multiple spin-offs of each one.
Persona 5 is basically a franchise unto itself. All these characters are, like, you know, sort of, like, are probably bigger than any recent Final Fantasy character in terms of how well-known they are and how distinctive they are and, you know, just... And then, yeah, it's just odd to see them in this where it's, like, I don't know.
It's, yeah, it's just, like, it's kind of... I don't say cash-in, but it has that vibe a little bit. So, yeah.
The fonts are upsetting me the most, though, Matthew.
Yeah, it really bummed me out.
I don't want to see... Persona 5 is quite this... It's a very special thing, so...
Yeah. I know that they've done this with the other games, but, like, if you look at, like, the fighting games or, like, the dancing games that they did with Persona 4, they at least were, like, coherent with the main game, like, the same kind of character models, the same sort of illustration style. When you lose that, I think, you know, even 5, like, when it did the Dynasty Warriors, the Persona Strikers, that looks kind of like Persona 5, you know?
The cast used to look the part in that one, too, right? They did, like, the proper animation and stuff, so.
Yeah. It's just, I don't know, like, is it, like, is it a push into a new art style so that you can, like, re-merchandise all this stuff in this art style? Is it as cynical as that?
I don't know, but, and it's quite, it's like 55 quid as well, like, it doesn't feel like, it's a weird old, it's a weird old thing, but I've only played, like, three hours of it, but I'm really not feeling it.
Yeah, I'm gonna skip that one. That's a hard pass from me, dog. I just, yeah, there's also, like, I can obviously just go back and play Persona 5 Royal if I want to, and see all the stuff that they put in that that I haven't seen before, and I give that a playthrough, so, yeah, I don't know.
It's sort of, it's nice everyone can play it on game pass for 20 minutes then move on, I guess, but bizarre. What a strange turn for the Persona series. I honestly just, in my head, had filed this away as, oh, well, that would be good, and I'd only even read it, yeah.
You know, what I was hoping for was, like, oh, it was going to be really good, and I'd be able to, like, secretly bank it as, like, my 10th game on Game of the Year, and be like, surprise, there was this really good attache of this game.
Yeah.
Instead, it's like...
It's funny, we both do the 4D chess thing for, like, Game of the Year. I'm the same. I've got to have one game that you don't expect to hear on there.
And I'm there, eyeing up, I'm easy on the bunker, like, am I going to give this six hours before we do the Game of the Year pod? Oh, what a time to be alive. Okay, Matthew, I think that's everything we're going to discuss.
Actually, I had one more thing here. Did you want to talk about the PS Portal briefly?
Yeah, I was going to say, well, I've played the PS Portal. I was curious if you had any questions about it. This is the PlayStation 5 streaming handheld device, which seems to have upset, like, a lot of the internet for not being, like, a new Vita and not being an actual, like, handheld gaming device, but being an elaborate second screen for your PS5 that only works by streaming from a PS5.
You mean Sony doesn't want to make another handheld that loses loads of money? I'm shocked to hear this.
Oh, well, it's like, if you go on any YouTube videos about the PS Portal, there are just so many comments underneath that are like, oh, well, you know, this is so dumb. This just streams from the PS5. You need a PS5.
Why didn't they just make a Vita with the power of the PS5? And you're like, have you fucking seen a PS5? It's, like, bigger than my house, you know?
Like, this isn't how these things work. It wasn't like, they were like, hmm, should we do a PS5 the size of a Vita or should we do a screen with two controllers attached to it? And it's, like, those aren't the options.
They haven't opted into this. Like, actually, and the other thing is people are like, it's 200 quid, you know, which is quite a lot, but like, the DualSense controller itself is like 70 quid. You know, so that, those components plus a pretty big, pretty decent LCD screens.
And eight inch LCD screens. So it's bigger than what you're gonna get on most phones. Like part of me is like, well, yeah, this kind of feels like 200 quid's worth of like electronics.
Like on paper, like what it is, is a thing which is 70 quid and a thing which is 130 quid stuck together. So yeah, I guess, I mean, that makes sense. But I don't wanna sound like I'm defending it too much.
Like it works as a streaming device. It goes through your Wi-Fi route. If you've ever done remote play on PlayStation 5, it's pretty good as far as these things go.
And I'd say the screen is big enough that it feels a bit nicer than like streaming to a phone with a backbone, which is the same technical experience, but on a much smaller screen. Like this is big enough that you could feasibly like enjoy quite a lot of games on it. Yeah, I just, I don't know.
Like it's probably not from like most people, but the like 5% of PS5 owners, it maybe is for like parents who don't want to share the TV with their kids or whatever. Like it does that well, I think. So that's my hot take.
It's fine. It's all fine, you know?
Yeah, your rationale of like it's a dual sense plus like, I don't know, a fucking Kindle Fire HD or something stuck together. It's like, I sort of get that in terms of cost. I suppose I also think that why would you buy this and not just buy like a Nintendo Switch Lite or something?
Like just, you know, like, but that's like, but that's not what they're selling. So I think like-
No, I'm just, I'm not defending, I don't want to sound like I'm overly defending the price of it. That isn't it, you know? It would be great if this thing was like 100 quid instead.
That would be like awesome.
Yeah, cause that's, you know, it's basically more than like, oh no, it's less than what the PS Vita costs at launch, but it's like, you know.
Yeah, when you look at it, you don't go like, oh, it doesn't look cheap, it looks nice. You know, it's got like nice, it's very solidly made, it's quite light, but the screen looks good, it's very glossy. You know, it looks like something that costs 200 quid.
Well, Sony doesn't fuck about with electronics, does it really? PS Move and Wonder Book aside, but it's like, I just can't, I won't feign any interest in it because it's not, it doesn't have any appeal to me. But then I say that as someone who has not really tried remote streaming at all.
Like that's just not entered my gaming lifestyle whatsoever. I just haven't had-
But you have total like command over your living space, so you don't need this.
That is a very generous way of saying, you're a man who lives alone. Like, that is basically what you just said, but you are correct. Like I have total, you have total command of your space because you're by yourself.
Oh, it is true though. No, no, that is true and fair. I'm trying to think of circumstances that have been in where this would be relevant.
I mean, yeah, I think like the TV thing is true. You're probably more used to this because you and Catherine are fighting for like screen time basically to get to play different games.
I think the thing where it makes the most sense like in my life, I haven't got one of these instantly. I've got to play one through work. Is that like the idea of maybe booting it up in bed, you know, like the idea of like playing, playing an hour of doing some fucking Dragon Quest grinding or whatever for like an hour.
But like that, that speaks to me. Like second screen of any kind, you know, or portable screen, whether it's the Steam Deck, the Switch, whatever, like the place I'm most likely is gonna be playing it out and about, I say out and about outside of the living room is sitting in my bed, you know?
Yeah, fair, fair. And it's sort of like Dragon Quest grinding. Is that a thing you do?
Well, not Dragon Quest. I was just trying to think of a JRPG. I couldn't think of it.
Well, I was just genuinely curious if that was something you were doing.
No, like, all right, you know, grinding my way through disc one of Final Fantasy VII on PS4, this would be absolutely fine for that. And the screen's big enough that you can play like, I, my mind went to JRPG, because I think of those as like, busier interface and you want to be able to read it all properly. Like, I played Starfield on my phone and it was a fucking nightmare, like reading all the stats and everything.
It just, it was just too small. It's like twice the size of my phone. Like it's, it's very, very viable as a, as a gaming device.
Oh man, imagine fucking doing a space battle in Starfield on a phone. That just feels completely incorrect.
10 hours of my playtime with it was on, was streaming on Game Cloud, whatever it's called, with the backbone controller on my phone.
And this is why we need a break, Matthew.
Yeah, I had to go down to Devon's and see my mom who'd broken her leg. So we had to go and like, you know, say nice things about her broken leg. You know, like you do with your parents.
But I also desperately needed to get in the starfield hours for this podcast. So, you know, I was sitting there talking to my mom, but then looking at my phone, she thought I was looking at Twitter. I was actually hanging out with Samco.
Yeah, just like landing on a planet that had like one sort of like facility on it and nothing else thinking, damn, it feels good to be a gangster. That was your weekend basically.
If there were two facilities, like the streaming would be like, oh shit, I'm gonna show you two things. And then the resolution would drop all the way down to 480p. It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I hope two guys don't come out of that door.
Yeah, this is a YouTube video in 2006 now. This is tough. Okay, good stuff.
Well, so yeah, we've learned a lot about you.
So, PS Portal, I just thought I threw out there that it's okay.
No, I like that we talk about hardware a bit on this because it is like, hardware that we sort of like spend 5% of our time using is actually ends up being quite relevant to this podcast, weirdly. It just comes, you know, like the Steam Deck or, you know, just whatever it might be. Like the, you know, I've thought about the Playdate.
I've not quite opted for it yet because as mentioned, the Quest 3 was my big hardware purchase this year. But yeah, I think it's nice to hear about, you know.
Playdate, once that's got old Lucas Pope's next game, you know that, that's when that becomes like a, you may have to pay attention to this now.
Yeah, absolutely. I don't know what the stock situation is on that because I was kind of like, I've been watching the Analog Pocket, but I've sort of given up on that because I feel like there's a mild grift element to how they do, we've got like exclusive colors and then it's on sale for like 30 seconds and then you're like, oh, I have to buy an eBay for 500 quid, I'd rather die actually, that's the worst thing I've ever heard. So no, thank you, as nice as your shiny Game Boy is.
So yeah, I prefer things that are in stock. That's my stance these days, Matthew.
That's why we want to take a pause of the podcast so you can dedicate more time to watching pre-order sites for the playdate.
Yeah, it's just very important to me. So yes, very good. So Matthew, should we take a quick break and come back with our last mailbag of the year?
Welcome back to the podcast. So, this is our final mailbag of the year. Thank you to everyone who submitted questions for the podcast this year.
We really appreciate it. If you wanna submit questions for next year's podcast, backpagegamesatgmail.com, and there's a Discord as well, which there's a link to that in our Twitter profile, and also our Blue Sky profile. So, you'll see a pod questions channel in there where you can drop in questions.
And we've been picking the, I would say a bit more selectively recently, because we get quite a lot of questions in there, and we wanna make sure we're not repeating ourselves, but we appreciate everything we get in there. But yes, submit your questions for next year, and we'll answer them as much as we can. So, this one, Matthew, do you wanna read out this first question from Jack?
Yes. Hi, Chaps. Really enjoyed your recent Spider-Man 2 discussion.
You touched briefly on the length debate. I wonder to what extent developers still fear their audiences will complain about the cost per hour of gameplay, especially with the rise of video game pricing. While people like myself welcome shorter experiences, do you feel that the majority of players in the West, and especially in the East, equate longer with better?
Will our appetites changing alongside the way we consume games? I, for one, would love to see Atlus, for example, reel in those runtimes, but can't help but feel I'm in an echo chamber. Keep up the great podding, Jack.
Yeah, it's a weird one. I 100% agree that this is something that players have begun to equate as longer equals better because they are inevitably being presented with big games that require a long time to play. And so, I don't know, if you are a bit younger than us, Matthew, and you don't remember completing Fable 2 in about 18 hours, you know, or Dead Space, well, I suppose you could play Dead Space Remake, you'd find out, but you know what I mean?
Like games that, you know, used to fire through basically like a game a week in 12 hours, and it was what it was. Then I think that this current paradigm of Horizon, you know, Forbidden West being monstrously long is what you're used to, or you're acclimatized to. So maybe you think more and more of games as things you buy like three or four of a year, and then you just play those.
And at the same time, I've seen that publishers now have developers to measure this stuff. So they've probably got data that tells them, that drives them mad because they can look at who completed a certain side quest in an open world game, sort of like the percentage completion stats basically. And so I do think that equating longer with better has happened unfortunately, but there will be a course correction at some point if data shows that no one is finishing their games.
And I can't speak for Matthew who is unbelievably prolific, but I struggled to finish my games this year, to actually get on top of all of them. I've just finished Spider-Man, but I've still got FF16s like last few chapters to do. And I've got Starfield to do.
If every game ends up being 20 to 50 hours, I think that's gonna cause a bit of a bottleneck and people will just stop buying new games and that's gonna create its own problems. What do you think of that, Matthew?
Yeah, there's so many different bits to this. You have the rise of subscription services, which just make games so much more accessible. And actually does game length matter as much if you have access to many more games?
Like is it the individual game that matters or is it like your general gaming time? You know, like are five 10-hour games on Game Pass equal to paying for one 50-hour game? I don't know.
The thing I find strange about the people equating like length with quality or that being an attractive quality in a game is that at the same time, I feel like there's a lot of pushback on the kind of games and the techniques that make games longer. Like the idea of like, we want games that are longer. They're good value for money, but we hate games of service, which are eternal games.
I don't, I can't quite kind of balance those two things out. You know, like the means of making games big is to fill them with open world crap, basically. Like that's what the industry's landed on.
And people are sick of that. So like, what are they actually asking for? Like 30-hour incredibly crafted story campaigns?
Like, I don't really know what people want. I'm hearing, I'm getting mixed messages, basically.
Yeah, it's funny to play Spider-Man, which people consider quite a lean game, Spider-Man 2, this year. But it still takes a fair amount of time to finish it. Like it's about, you know, I think it probably takes upwards of 20 hours for most people to clear the major map stuff, as well as the main story.
And like that felt long enough to me. Like I wasn't there thinking, oh, this is short for a blockbuster. I was there thinking, this is what a blockbuster should be in length.
It wasn't really, it's only because everything else has become so inflated by comparison, you know?
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure we'll talk about this in the Game of the Year episode, but I think this actually has been quite a good year for AAA story games, getting their lengths right, or having the right amount of stuff based on, like, how deep their systems were, or how big their worlds were, or the kind of games they set out to make, you know, things like Resident Evil 4, Jedi Survivor, you know, a lot of these things were just about right, in the same way that I think Spider-Man 2 got it just about right, but... Yeah.
It's hard to generalize, though, because, like, if I'm loving a game, then yes, I want more and more of it, you know? Like, this year I played, I don't know, like 150 hours of Tears of the Kingdom, and I love that game. I wasn't like, ugh, god, I hate this, too much of this.
Like, that was as much of that game as I wanted. But then Final Fantasy XVI, I was like, I would happily have had half of this game. You know, like, it varies case to case.
You always want more of a good thing, less of a bad thing. That's not a very spicy take.
Well, no one would argue, I think, that, like, Baldur's Gate 3 should be significantly shorter. People seem happy to revel in that game, in that world, right? So, I do agree, it's about, you know, the context of the game itself, but it feels like there are just too many big games jostling for attention now, and time is against everyone as much as money, really.
So, I don't know if that is sustainable, if you can just keep releasing, like, a new 30-hour game every month. Like, I just, where are people? We make a podcast, I struggle to find the time, but I try my best, you know?
But, like, the quality this year, I feel like we're owed quite a bad year next year.
Oh, yeah, we need another 2020, like, two big time. Like, bring on, like, one blockbuster that's good, and, like, eight Norcos, and I'm, like, there, you know?
Yeah, next year is, like, GTA 6, eight Norcos, and all the blockbusters from this year that you didn't play. That is the story of next year, I guarantee you.
Yeah, and, like, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, that's it. But nothing else, yeah, or just catching up with the Yakuza series. Then you get to the end of the year, and you can finally play Infinite Wealth.
That's basically, like, the journey. So, yeah. Okay, I think there's some good thoughts on that one, Matthew.
Okay, so next one. This is from Jorgen Ericsson Steen Johansen. I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly there.
Or Hubert on the Discord, much shorter. Much easier. Hi, lads.
I just picked up the recently released Metal Gear Solid Collection on Switch. MGS1 has unexpectedly become my personal MVP of the package. The unenhanced presentation has transported me back in time, to sitting on the floor in front of the telly, watching my mates stumbling through the very first level in absolute confusion.
We lads and neither of us understood a word of English. It might be an unpopular take, but I'm glad MGS1 still looks like shit. Anyway, the weather is shit.
The sun barely peeks over the horizon. It's cold, dark and wet, and for me, MGS1 fits the season perfectly. What are your favourite game and season pairings?
Matthew, what are your thoughts on this one?
Two classic autumnal slash winter games, Fable 2 and Twilight Princess. I'll always come back to Twilight Princess as a great autumn game. Slightly dying world.
Everything in that slightly kind of sort of burnished gold. I played it in a very cold room with the projectile shitting rats. That isn't a part of autumn, but it's, you know, part of my memory.
That, I think, has got good seasonal vibes. Like winter, specifically Christmas, I will always talk up Last Window, the sequel to Hotel Dusk, set in the days around Christmas and quite a lonely Christmas. The kind of Christmas where a load of lonely weirdos in apartment block are kind of forced to come together and celebrate Christmas because they got nowhere else to go.
That has, thankfully, never been my Christmas. But, again, immaculate vibes I really bought into.
Yeah, I think that, for me, the Rockstar games end up being quite tied to seasons. I don't know why that is as such, but like Bully, for example, has the full gamut of seasons because you're there for the school year. But the Christmas in that game is so evocative.
It's such a great, the entire town is covered in snow. And I think because you play a child character, you just remember the context of what it was like when Christmas would roll around. You would get genuinely excited for a time of year.
I couldn't even imagine what that's like now. As a man who never gets excited about like, you know, oh, we're in December, great. I'm a bit like, the most excited thing about me with Christmas now is I can go and have like one nice meal at a restaurant where I can order from the Christmas menu.
That's basically like what, that's more exciting to me than gifts or like Christmas Day. Christmas Day, I'm like, all right, we just got to get through this, you know, and then like, I can go play Silent Hill 2 in my parents' room, like, you know, yeah.
I never really, well, oboe head stalks you. I, some colleagues of mine this week were getting very excited that like seasonal coffee rangers were coming in at their various coffee shops that they bought their coffees from. Like, Special Cups, you know, like Costa have cracked out their Christmas Cup and Greg's has cracked out its Christmas Cup.
And I feel like there's a huge part of the world or life that I'm missing out on by not being like a big coffee drinker. Do you engage with any of that?
I actually can't be doing with people who use pumpkin spice latte as the basis for a personality. That makes me want to just fucking die. I just, I really just cannot be doing with it.
Like, it's just not my scene. I really do enjoy going for coffee and stuff, but it's a much more transactional relationship I have with it, you know what I mean? Does that tickle you, Matthew?
Yeah, that's just fine. But I guess our equivalent of that is getting, like, very excited by and making JC's kitchen a cool stand of our personalities.
Oh, I'm very embarrassing in lots of other ways, Matthew. Just like, no, just not in this one. I mean, yeah, it's true, like, Christmas sandwiches are basically my version of this, I suppose.
Like, the prep one's back, so that's good. That's always pretty solid.
Oh, I'm back on the old Pret Swedish Meatball Wraps.
Oof, I've not, I don't think I've ever had those. The wraps, I'm always concerned with the wraps. There's just not enough bread content to keep me full to, like, you know, I get to, like, 4pm, you live, sorry, you work right near a Sainsbury's, don't you?
I'd be ducking in there, getting a six-pack of Wotsits, and I'd be, like, three bags down by 5.30, that's, you know what I mean?
The wraps are okay, I mean, yeah, you're right. You know, it's quite thin, as a carbs go. But, and there's always the lucky dip of, you know, what's in the Swedish meatball wrap is the meatballs, obviously.
A spicy tomato sauce, which, for my very mild palate, is almost too spicy, and cheese, and sometimes you'll luck out, and, like, some fool will put way too much cheese in it, and then it's just, like, a big fucking cheesy meatball heaven. I'm like, oh, yes, this is amazing. Sometimes there's, like, no cheese, and, like, too much spicy tomato, and that's quite a bad hang.
That means I'm definitely getting an indigestion from that thing. So, yeah, that's Swedish meatball wraps.
Okay, it's good, and I can't remember how we got here. Oh, yeah, that's right, like, game and season pairings.
Oh, yeah.
No, no, I enjoyed that digression, I imagine our listeners would, too.
You know you've been going to prep too much, where they're like, they recommend to you, like, you should get the paid loyalty card. As in, like, we feel like we're taking you for a ride, but you don't have this.
Yeah, I think they make that seem a lot more straightforward than it actually is, and it's basically fucking game pass for sandwiches and coffees, and I just...
Well, it's mostly coffee, it's like five coffees a day, and what it has done, sorry, I don't mean to, like, turn this into a big prep thing, but prep is now, like, a place which has food, but if you go and get food, it means you're stuck behind, like, 50 motherfuckers getting their subscription coffees, and the people on the tills are so busy making all the variations of fucking coffees for people, it's like, who needs Game Pass for coffee? Like, that's insane.
That looks like a really fucking stressful job as well, because there's that little one, in the little one in the centre of town, there's, like, one person at the till, and then one barista making the coffees, and it's really bad.
I think they should have someone, they should have a till, which is only for, like, food people.
Yeah, yeah.
Like, cos I'm paying full whack for my food. I'm not there on a subscription service anyway. That's, that's going on.
Last thing I'll say about the pret menu at present is that little New Yorker sort of, like, sourdough bagel thing they've got, that is top-notch with the little crispy onions in it. That's actually, like, fucking amazing. You have to go to, well, that's because they only do it at Big Pret in Bath, Matthew, and you're going to Small Pret.
Big Pret has, like, slightly, like, about four or five more things you can't get at Little Pret, and so...
It's, like, five more minutes away.
Yeah, that could be up to, like, 30 calories that you're burning doing that, so you want to save those precious calories for the afternoon. Yeah, so that's the Pret thing. Okay, seasonal stuff.
Weirdly, I think I always tie Mass Effect to Christmas because I played in 2009, I played Mass Effect 2 for review, so I was thinking about that as my friend, my friend Andrew's been playing Mass Effect 2 recently and messaging me about it. I could really spend a bit of time with the Normandy crew over Christmas, sounds pretty good.
Let me guess, Captain Andrew?
Probably, yeah. But it's a bit less cursed than him being Barrett or whatever the fuck was going on in his Final Fantasy VII playthrough. Rockstar Games, like I mentioned, so Bully is one, but also I've got such a vivid memory, I'm sure everyone does, of playing Red Dead Redemption in the summer in 2010, so I consider that a big summer game because obviously much of what you're doing in that game is looking at amazing sunsets in the distance.
I think the last time I replayed that, I definitely played it in the summer and I get that vibe from it. Even GTA IV is a great spring game as well, because that came out in April or May time in 2008, I guess all those years ago when it released. But I think it's just because, again, New York is just a great sort of like...
New York in the spring just looks kind of amazing, because again, you've still got those sort of slightly earlier evenings and stuff, and golden hour and that sort of thing. I think GTA IV just captures those spring vibes really well, because obviously they're just putting so much time and attention into the weather effects and the way these things feel. I think that stuff just like lands better.
So yeah, Rockstar Games are a big one, and then Mass Effect for whatever reason. A little bit of Assassin's Creed at Christmas as well. I consider that a bit of a, you know, you just play the one they brought out at Christmas, at Christmas, and see how that goes.
Bait and big Christmas games.
Yeah, but that's a much more interesting pick, you know. So yeah, but hopefully that ticks the box there, Matthew. Do you want to read out this next one?
Yes. Hi guys, I'm a latecomer to your show. Haven't stumbled on a recommendation on our podcasts, and I'm glad I did.
Thought it might be fun to r slash podcasts. How do you say that? I'm not like a, I don't talk about Reddit much.
r slash podcasts, whatever. Podcasts on Reddit. Oh, this is disaster.
Hi guys, I'm a latecomer to your show. Haven't stumbled on a recommendation on r slash podcasts, and I'm glad I did. Thought it might be fun to sort old to new.
So I've started at episode one, and I've just finished your episode nine, Hitman Special. Good luck making it past that one. That's the one.
If you get past that, you're a real head, and you're in for the long haul.
That was a great episode.
It was a great episode, but it's our least listened to one, isn't it?
No, you're thinking of the James Bond one. That's the second one. That was like the one that no one listened to.
I think it took ages to break a thousand downloads, and then when it did, it was still pretty low.
Oh, that's what I'm thinking of. Okay, well, thank you. Episode nine, Hitman Special.
Cheating gets a bad rap these days, rightfully, but back in the day, every games mag had a cheats page. Do you have any favourite cheats from over the years? Also, I was wondering, what are your guys' takes on digital games versus physical games?
You might have already covered this in a later episode. We have. Game Pass is a compelling argument for digital will do, but are we really going to enter a paradigm where we can't lend, borrow, trade in or sell games we've paid for?
Where we pay £800 money for a console under the understanding that if we then agree to pay a further £20 money...
Sorry, this is making me laugh. He said where we pay £500 money for a console under the understanding that if we then agree to pay a further £20 money each month for the rest of that console's life, we can use it to play some games. Once again guys, great show.
I know it shouldn't matter that you're two voices from the UK, but it's great hearing from journalists who wrote for the magazines I read. Keep up the good work, Rick. Sorry, Rick, I really mangled the reading of that.
You're not going to get to this episode for another year and a half.
When you're listening to this episode in your nuclear bunker, and the rest of humanity has been wiped out, I hope you're doing okay, Rick.
I hope we took at least a million money with you as well.
So yes, I guess the first part of the question is cheats. Definitely my favourite cheat. I was massively into the GTA 3 cheats, because that game was too fucking hard to complete like a normal person.
So I was always getting the weapons one, and I had that burned into my brain. So I could still probably do that from memory, the cheat for that one. I know exactly when to tap the shoulder buttons for that one.
But the one I really liked was the Dodo plane cheat that turned any car in the game into the Dodo plane, basically. So you would just be precariously driving a saloon vehicle like past some skyscrapers because you've very carefully got this car to take off from a little ramp. And then you're just like, can't really turn left or right properly, but just trying to do the almost Arkham style gliding mechanism to keep it going.
And then just precariously floating across the city. I love that because I turned it on and thought, I'm inviting complete chaos here. And there's no real benefit to doing it other than it's just quite fun.
But it was the first sandbox game I played, and that was fun enough for me to just enjoy it for hours at a time. So that jumps out. I probably along with the Sonic 2 cheats, where you could basically just have all the Chaos Emeralds and then just unlock Super Sonic by having a load of rings.
But what about you, Matthew?
Yeah, I always got a shout out to Red Dead Redemption 2 as a modern game, which still had type them in cheats. It has a cheat screen. I like those cheats where they're like a little sentence.
So you like type, I want a load of guns or something, and then you get a load of guns. That's very endearing. Yeah, I mean, loads of variations on like invincibility and level selects in, yeah, like Mega Drive platformers, Sonic and all that.
That's a given. I remember James Pond 2 had a cheat where at the start of the game, James Pond 2's mechanic, he says, body stretches and you can keep stretching up and up and up and then you can hold onto platforms and then pull your legs up from the ground to kind of climb up high. But if you grew like all the way to like the top, like outer bounds of the level, there were a series of items.
And if you like nudged the items, which spelt cheat, you would get like a cheat menu. So yeah, I remember doing that. Like it just took so long to input the cheat and stretch all the way up there.
You know, we only ever played that game with cheat. So it'd be like, all right, well, here's the way we've started it. Let's do the three minute bit where we put in this cheat.
That took ages. I mean, like basically every PC first person shooter, which had like a console going in and doing like God mode to just like run around like murking everything because I was very, very bad. It took me a long time to get my head around like mouse keyboard.
So like I played loads of games or like the, is it no clip where you just go through all the walls?
Yeah.
All that kind of shit. And then you just sort of zoom out and get to see like, you know, what a half life level looked like from like a mile away or whatever. And yeah, I did a lot of that shit.
Yeah. I was big into that in the game Jedi Knight as well. Like it was just turning on sort of like, you know, sort of basically you could just float endlessly and then clip out and then just like, look at a level from far away and be like, wow, isn't that fucking weird?
Like, yeah. So I kind of, I kind of love that stuff too. I don't know what the appeal of it, just the rule breaking factor of it, I suppose.
But yeah, I don't like, I want that no one really, I mean, I don't know if this counts as a cheat actually, because I don't know how you unlock it, but remember Donut Drake, Matthew, we talked about this before.
The big fat Drake.
But they cut out, they didn't add to Uncharted 4, because by then it become basically like bad to do that. But I think it is still in like the original, the fat and the furious trophy is still in Uncharted, Drake's 14 remastered on PS4. You can play that on your PS5 right now.
The thing is, I don't think it is appropriate to make fun of people for being overweight, even though like I've got, he just, Donut Drake has a big me in 2020 energy after just ordering McDonald's consecutively for 10 months. But one comment I just saw on Push Square about Donut Drake being ditched and uncharted 4 was, This is terrible news. I live in Merseyside and real people here look like Donut Drake.
Dot, dot, dot, sad. That absolutely killed me. So yeah, but I don't know if he was a cheat or not, but he kind of like comes to mind as well.
But got a few different ones there, but obviously GoldenEye as well. So those are the classic cheats, aren't we? Yep, so they go without saying really.
What about the other part of the question about digital games versus physical disks, Matthew? So we do cover this later on. I think like my take on this is that digital licenses have sort of killed physical games a little bit, and the way that physical games work now is a kind of key for you to download like something massive onto your console, means that they don't have like loads of value on PS5 and Xbox anyway.
But on Switch, physical games do seem to matter still. It doesn't feel like you need to.
Yeah.
And that's what I love about Nintendo really, is that you pay your 40 quid and you just have the game. And if you're not connected to the internet, you can have a pretty good time. Most games don't even have a day one patch on Switch, you know?
Yeah.
I feel like my opinion on physical digital will change massively based on what Nintendo decide to do with the transition to the next Switch.
Right.
If they're like, you have to buy all your digital games again, I'll be like fucking furious. Like if there's no backwards compatibility, or if there is backwards compatibility, but it's only with like cartridges, because most of my games are digital, then I'll probably become like a radical, like anti-digital person. But at the moment I'm like reasonably pro digital, just in the name of like not having much clutter.
But then I've never really engaged with like trading and lending. I tend to just buy things like one and done. I'm not a very efficient gamer in that sense.
I know some of our listeners just from the Discord are like really on top of kind of squeezing it, getting as much out of every copy of every individual games, and fair play to them. I think this stuff probably means more to those people than it does me.
The other day though, I was just looking at like a stack of PlayStation games I had, and I had like Resistance 3, and then like Returnal, and like FF16, and I thought like Bloodborne in a pile. I was like, you know what? It's just nice to walk around a room sometimes and look at these things.
They are good. Game Pass is compelling, but they're not in your collection, and they are treated as disposable. You do sort of like move on from them.
I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, because I think that Game Pass has a lot of upsides to it. But I think it is okay to have, as long as your relationship with your physical possessions is quite healthy. It's nice to just look at them.
But yeah, I think I agree with you. If Nintendo changed the rules on this, I too will become...
I think that's like my Joker origin story.
I don't think they ever will change that though, because I think that physical games are actually genuinely valuable to them in a way that they're not to Sony and Microsoft in the same way. I think they just matter too much.
I just feel like they've made me buy into their digital ecosystem this generation in a much bigger way.
Yeah.
I hope that they respect that. That I've done that for them.
When I've spent 40 money, I want my 40 money to be...
When you were talking about just observing all these PlayStation games in their boxes in your flat and that pleasing you, that made me think it's yet another benefit of being in a space which you fully control.
AKA. Single Loser Man. OK, next question.
Hi gents, in anticipation of the release of the forthcoming Metal Gear Solid Collection, someone sent this in a few weeks ago, sorry about that, I recently revisited MGS5 Ground Zeroes. While the main story mission is the highlight of the package and remains fantastic, in the almost 10 years since release I had completely forgotten about the side mission called Intel Operative Rescue. This shooting gallery style mission tasks you with eliminating 60 enemies while escorting a critical VIP to extraction, culminating in a rocket launcher shootout with an enemy helicopter prior to the successful escape.
All good fun despite not really being very stealthy, but the kicker is the absolutely preposterous post-mission cutscene when it is revealed that the VIP you are rescuing was in fact a 2014-era CG render of Hideo Kojima himself, resplendent with sponsored spectacles and a what-took-you-so-long stinger he presumably had to get into the booth to record. Obviously, Kojima is no stranger to ensuring his presence in his own games. That's an understatement.
But this seemed to be a particularly egregious example of the art form. Which brings me on to my question. What is your favourite example of self-referencing in games?
Either in a positive or negative sense. Love the pod and keep up the good work. You make Friday morning commute that much more bearable.
Thanks from Stuart in Glasgow. Cheers, man. So I actually think Matthew, to conjure up a really recent example, like the way Remedy does it in Alan Wake 2 is actually fucking rad.
So the control stuff you can take or leave maybe, like they're like, oh, the FBCs here on the scene or whatever. But I quite like the idea of not all of their references are just like, it's literally from this game. In the case of Sean Ashmore, our guy in the Save Point station, he is basically like a living reference to Quantum Break.
And he obviously is called Tim Breaker as previously established. But I think that's neat. Obviously, the whole Alex Casey thing is like a Max Payne throwback as well.
That goes all the way back to the origins of Remedies of Studio. You've got that combined with the actual crossover stuff with Control. And I think that stuff is adding color, but it's not necessarily contrived in that MCU style way.
We've come to hate where it's an endless procession of blorcos. I mean, Sean Ashmore kind of is the blorco of the Remedy games a little bit. So what do you make of that as a take on this?
Yeah, no, it's... Yeah, they really lean heavily into it. And the one which really gets me is the Alex Casey being the face of Sam Lake, the voice of James McCaffrey, which, of course, is the same combo as Max Payne, the face of Sam Lake, the voice of James McCaffrey.
Except here he's playing another hard-boiled cop who talks a lot like Max Payne. Like, whether or not it means anything, there is some fun in like, oh, I can sort of, you know, I can see how all this is related. And I like, I think the thing I respond most to is just, you know, I like the idea of a, of a kind of a, you know, film directors who have like their acting troupe, you know, or the idea of Game Studio having that also, like the same pool of like weirdos that they've collected over the years, who they sort of find a reason to bring them back for like a little five-minute gig or a little ten-minute gig or whatever.
Like Nola North in Last of Us, for example.
Yeah, that kind of stuff. You know, I think like whatever they're actually doing with them and whatever their technical roles are in the story or whether they make any sense, it just reminds you that there are like people behind these games and they're friends and this is like a social exercise making these games and it's an excuse for them to kind of bring these people back and there is such affection for these actors clearly and respect for them and I don't know, I get some sentimental warmth from that. It's probably what I react to the most.
Yeah, I think that's probably like the most sort of like, in some ways that is the most interesting example of it. I mean, I was also going to throw in, for example, like I was very fond in the original Bayonetta of the Sega and Capcom references in there. So there was a bit of like Kamiya referencing his previous work in there, you know, talking about Kamiya and Brest Evil 2 and stuff like that.
I like that stuff. I kind of gave up on that for the sequel, which is a bit of a shame. But as I say, like Sonic Mania, does that kind of count?
Like there's like references to the series there, but those are like literally outside observers going, remember this cool thing about Sonic that we liked in the 90s and where Sega itself wouldn't have the self-awareness to include that stuff, which is quite interesting. But that's arguably, that perspective is arguably why Sonic Mania is great. So what about you, Matthew, any more to throw in here?
I really like Dandy Dungeon by Kimura. Is it Yoshio Kimura? It's a game about a developer leaving his like AAA background to set up an indie studio, which is exactly what Kimura did.
And then running into this sort of like fictionalized journey of, you know, he's against this like massive evil organization. You know, he's trying to bring them down with just the power of this weird little indie game that he's kind of making in his pants in his room. And that's the kind of the story that unfolds over this weird little puzzle game.
But, you know, Kimura was famously sort of in house at Grasshopper and everything. You can't help but maybe see it as a commentary on like Tencent coming in and buying all these studios that he grew up with. And then, you know, setting out to make a kind of a parody of that whole situation.
That I really like. Speaking of Grasshopper, it's not really self-referential, but it's like knowing like a lot of Suder's games are very self-aware. I don't know if that's quite answers the question.
But like, you know, in Flower, Sun and Rain, there's a lot of people who know they're in a video game. Does that count? Or does it have to specifically be the designers themselves in the game?
Well, it actually doesn't really. It's quite... I don't think the designer thing is so specific.
It's like it's almost like, yeah. So breaking the fourth wall is, I guess, a slightly different thing. But I think it's a nice example.
Yeah. David Cage as the Tutorial Man in Fahrenheit.
I still just think of that Andy Kelly compilation, The From Fahrenheit Now, where it starts with David Cage going, Hi, I'm David Cage and this is Fahrenheit. And then it cuts to the most insane clips you've ever seen. Just complete random bullshit.
An absolute favorite of mine. I watch that video probably once every six months to pick myself up. But yeah, those are some good examples, I think, Matthew.
It's slightly rare because you have to have Cache as a developer to be able to pull that off to begin with. And Remedy have worked really hard to build that up right. So they're one of the only studios who can really get away with it.
And Japanese creators with the likes of Suda or Shinji Mikami have enough Cache to be able to drop that stuff in there and for people to pick up on it and enjoy it. But most people can't really get away with it because they're seen as part of a big amorphous blob of people in a big studio or whatever. Do you want to read out this next one, Matthew?
Currently listening to episode 149, and I have an urgent question. How would Matthew rob a bank with the house robots from Robot Wars? Would people control them or just Matthew?
Are they sentient in this reality? What robot would he trust to carry the loot?
Yep, so that's a question for you.
That's from imgstrura63. This refers to a story I told in that episode where we were talking about Robot Wars and I said, I used to have a shtick about how I would rob a bank with the house robots from Robot Wars. The key part of that story is I used to have a shtick.
Long forgotten, I'm really sorry about this. I was desperately trying to think of that episode. I spout so much bullshit, I have no idea what I said 20 years ago about the house robots.
Only that I said it a lot. There was part of it, the only bit I do remember was Sergeant Bash has a flamethrower, right? The house robot, Sergeant Bash.
There was one called Hypno Disc, which had a buzz saw, like a spinning blade on it. There was something about the spinning blade throwing some flammable, like having some flammable vial on it and covering everyone in the bank with some kind of flammable liquid, which then Sergeant Bash basically became the kind of hostage taker because he is the flames. That's how much I can remember is that if you like, if anyone made a noise, Sergeant Bash was going to set everyone on fire.
It's not like very creative. I don't really understand why I was very unpopular at school. If this was the level of my banter.
Yeah.
Incredible.
I guess I'd have to be controlling them with lots of people. I actually had another shtick about robbing a bank with a marathon. I had this theory that if enough people robbed a bank, they weren't going to send 300 people to prison for the same crime.
You know what? People should not have let you watch fucking Insight Man in 2006. That was a terrible mistake on the part of this country to allow that to happen.
I used to think a lot about robbing banks as a 13-year-old.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, would people be jogging through the bank? What's the deal there?
I just thought the number of bodies. You have a marathon. They all run in.
The bank gets robbed. You're like, well, we know it was these 300 people. We don't know specifically which one.
So, what are we going to do? Have we got enough jail cells for 300 people?
That is very clever. I come to think of it.
It's just not worth the bother. Let's just let them go.
Yeah, it's not as clever as what if Sergeant Bash set everyone on fire. But, you know, it certainly has its merits.
Well, the thing is, look at Sergeant Bash. It's like a human couldn't do that plan because a human would also be scared of being set on fire. But Sergeant Bash is like, no worries.
Yeah, don't worry about it, mate. It's fine. Yeah, okay.
Very good. People seem to really like that 2001 episode, didn't they? That went down well.
So, I'm excited to do 2002 next year. It should be good. Okay.
Next question. Hey Podlads, what was your favorite or in your opinion the best piece of tap that came free with a game mag? It could be something that wasn't even from a mag you worked on or even a games mag.
Just something you still remember or even cherish to this day. Trying to think outside the realm of posters or cheat code books. Inversely, what was the worst?
Looking at you DS decals are probably the best. Cheers, Connor. It's not time to dunk on Catherine's DS again.
That's happening every week at this rate, so let's leave that. So the best thing I ever got with a magazine was definitely issue one of the Future Magic Planet Game Boy which came with two AAA batteries that you could use in your Game Boy Color from Energizer. They went straight in when I got my Game Boy Color.
I was like, yes, results. I will now play Super Mario Brothers Deluxe and have an absolutely amazing time, because that's what I did in 1998 or whatever. So that was good.
But I would say that most of the, I don't think any of the tack got long-term use. I remember a lot of frisbees that wouldn't go through the air like a frisbee is supposed to. That's my memory is like, oh, this magazine came with a frisbee.
I will throw it, and it just immediately flops to the ground and you're like, okay.
Bursts and deflates. How is that even possible?
Yeah. Then I remember defiling the front page of a lot of issues of the Beano, because they'd have attached a drumstick lolly to it. Then ripping off and being like, well, that's the first four panels ripped off of the front page of this comic book because I needed to get this sweetie off of it.
There's no narrative coherence to this mini-namix because I wanted this sherbet dib dab too ferociously.
Yeah. What you just described is basically my 1996. So that was good.
So yeah, those come to mind, but they were just mostly shy. I got really cursed, the mouse mat at some point, from some magazine. I can't remember what it was.
I think it was like one of those, it's like a vague 2000 era, sort of like pop culture thing that had like games, movies. And I think I only bought it for the mouse mat, got it out and it smelled weird. And I was like, this is bad.
But what about you, Matthew? Can you top the Energizer batteries?
I can't remember if it was NGamer or O&M that gave away like a little metal tin, the shape of a NES controller. That was quite nice. I used to store DS cards in that and just have it rattling around on my desk all the time.
But I was quite fond of that. I think it was Arcade Magazine gave away that Game Over book, The History of Nintendo. Nice.
Yeah, maybe it was slightly abridged, but it was still, I felt like the meat of the book anyway. You know, in that book, oh, what is the name of the guy who wrote it? Was it David someone?
Anyway, I can't remember. That book is still like the source of like a lot of the information we know about like the origins of Nintendo as a games company. Like most Wikipedia pages, you know, if you follow them back, we'll be pulling from that Game Over book.
It was like before everything went sort of super locked down and controlled in terms of PR and things. So that was really good. Terms of bad gifts.
I mean, the old timer was the NGamer Ice Cube tray that was made from the wrong kind of plastic, which if you put it in a freezer, it just shattered into razor sharp shards. It was so hard. Like, oh, it was a fucking disaster.
And we had so many of them left over that they gave it away twice. There was like another issue where we did like a lucky dip of like, it was one of four previous gift and one of them might have been the Ice Cube tray. That thing was absolutely rancid.
We gave away an inflatable chain chomp on NGamer, except I think the way you designed it, like it looked right flat, but when you inflated it, he looked like he was like really grinning in a way that a chain chomp shouldn't. And we used to call that wrong chomp in the office. We used to get readers to take pictures of like, where like wrong chomp in weird places and then we'd print them in the mag.
A lot of affection for that. Yeah, I'll tell you one that was amazing. I actually, Cube Magazine, the rival to NGC, gave away like an action replay or Game Genie style disc for the GameCube that let you play import copy of Animal Crossing.
Right, right.
So you could put that in and then it would load up and let you put in a US disc. So Animal Crossing didn't come out in GameCube in the UK at all or not until quite late. I can't quite remember.
It's like two years or something ridiculous like that.
Yeah, so like if you wanted to get in on Animal Crossing, this was the way to do it. So that was a good gift.
Yeah, those are some good examples. I think that one, that last one, definitely tops the batteries actually, because that was like a huge deal to be able to play Animal Crossing at the time.
It's a huge deal to have electricity.
What is this, the 18th century? Let's move on to the next question. Okay.
Do you read this one, Matthew, actually?
Hey up there, large man. What's the most ill-advised game based on a movie that you can think of? There will be Bud, third-person brawler, The Shining fighting game.
How about Apocalypse Now, hack and slash? Love the recent X-Sail episodes as well. Cheers.
That's from JustKai. JustKai is asking for us to imagine fictional movie times rather than actual bad movie times. Is that right?
Yeah, that is right. Yeah. I did actually give this some proper thought.
I got Platoon as a light gun game. That's just the little taste to get started. David Cronenberg's erotic thriller Crash, adapted by David Cage.
A lot of the same scenes with QTEs, just sort of like.
Surely that would be better as a burnout game. That game is almost Crash, but without the sex crash.
That's way better. Criterion's David Cronenberg's Crash. That's really good.
I heard a podcast about that film recently. I was like, what a lurid and weird bit of cinema that is. I've got Tar as a dating sim.
I've got a much darker one to end with. I've got Zone of the Enders of Interest, directed by Jonathan Glaser. Matthew, that's my last one.
I didn't like that one. Okay. That's what I got.
What about you?
All I wrote down was The Sims Dogville expansion. One of my ideas is The Sims House, except it's just chalk outlines and everyone in it is incredibly sad and being quite unpleasant to Nicole Kidman. This is the expansion for you.
There you go. We treated that question with the contempt it may have been of. So that's good.
Okay. Next question. Hello, big blokes.
Do either of you play much local multiplayer these days? If yes, what are your top picks? If not, what are the main blocking factors?
Which of any local multiplayer games do you wish you could try out? For a bonus, if time slash will to live allows, what are some of the best slash worst, most common exclamations when playing multiplayer with friends? EG.
Matthew's famous Yell of Piss. That was during Halo Infinite. That's from Balladeer.
I don't play as much local co-op these days, Matthew. I think the number of games you can actually play in local co-op is a lot smaller than people realize. It's like a tiny handful every year really, and only one or two will really break through that people talk about.
So I don't know. I think Mario Wonder is pretty much the last, the major one from this year, and even so I haven't played it in co-op yet. But the last one I gave a proper go was It Takes Two, and I had the awkward thing that game is about basically like a couple whose relationship is on the rocks.
Me and my partner broke up halfway through playing that game, which felt a little bit on the nose, I'll be honest.
You mean Dr. Hakeem's hilarious dialogue couldn't be new actually.
Sadly, it didn't quite work.
Hey, Samuel, what are you doing?
He needs to do more voices on this podcast. That's good.
That was an impression of him. That wasn't an inappropriate impression.
That's good. Brackets, this is not racist. But yeah, apart from that, I don't know if I've ever really crossed paths with me recently.
Like I say, Mario Wonder, I'd love to play. What about you, Matthew?
Yeah. I mean, my boring answer for this is that the person I'd have to play multiplayer games with is Catherine. She is much better at games than me and that's not fun for either of us.
Like I feel shamed, she feels bored. That's, yeah, so we don't do that. Yeah, like I just don't have a big culture of like going around mates houses anymore.
I don't know if people my age still do that. Like, I don't know, but sadly, it's not the case. I guess when I lived with Rich Stanton, we used to play multiplayer a little bit.
You know, we used to do a lot of like, it was more past the Pad Geometry Wars 2. That was big for us. Rich tried to teach me to play Street Fighter 4.
I guess, like, if Rich had been able to teach me to play Street Fighter 4, he would have had Street Fighter 4 multiplayer on tap in the flat, which would have been like his dream life. Like the idea he could just play at any, but I was so shit at it that that just didn't happen. Yeah, I don't know.
Like, I'm not a very competitive person, which is why I don't play multiplayer. Co-op, I do like and we will play co-op campaigns like I really hope Microsoft get their asses in gear and make Gears 6 soon because I really enjoy playing the co-op campaigns with Catherine in those. So yes, as for explanations, yeah, just I say piss a lot.
I say piss a lot in general, but that's just the thing I say a lot when anything goes wrong. Like at work, I say piss a lot as well.
Yeah, I don't really have anything like that. I mean, probably the closest example I can give you for this is that me and Jay Bayliss sometimes guess the show. We got a big sort of Super Puzzle Fighter 2 turbo thing going on and we are essentially evenly matched to that actually.
We weirdly will just alternate who wins games and one person will talk a bit more than the other one and then their brain will shut down slightly and then the other person will win and it balances out quite nicely. But there are just these instances of hard pauses as we are just trying to rack up the best combos or whatever and destroy the other player. But the trash talk is very polite.
It's like, oh, sorry, it really seemed like you were going to win there and then I did you at the end or whatever. I mean, it's not all that to be honest. You can tell with Matthew that he's out of his comfort zone when he's thrown into a competitive environment.
That was the funny thing about Halo is just that you felt like you weren't supposed to be there. You had that energy and so you were reacting to that on the fly and that was what was wonderful about it. And it's sadly why it was so fleeting.
But I think it's beautiful because it lasts Matthew so well. Okay, next question then. Do you want to read this one Matthew?
Hi, chaps. Simple one from me. What were your favorite and least favorite subjects at school?
If I had to predict, I'd go for Matthew's favorite being English literature and Samuel's being media studies. Least favorite is a bit more tricky, but I'd guess something like textiles for both of you. I remember this question because it made me laugh when I read it.
The assumptions made me laugh on Discord.
Yeah, and I thought it would be fun to litigate some of the less relevant to games questions. It's funny because English literature was my favorite subject and you're kind of right about textiles. I don't really remember doing textiles that much.
Weirdly, I just remembered a teacher I had called Mrs. Waffles.
That sounds like an Animal Crossing character.
It does. She was a rhinoceros actually in a dress.
She used to go, Every time you spoke to her, that's how she started.
I think she's dead now in real life.
That's killed me.
Right. How to get this back on track from that. I liked English literature, I guess.
I hated science and math, government and politics. Basically real subjects that real people have to know in real life to achieve things. I just couldn't be doing with any of those really.
But basically any subject where I got to be vaguely creative was good. I never did media studies because my mum taught me. She drilled into me that that is a subject that no one will look at university application and be like, oh, this was a serious person.
There was a lot of snittiness about media and film studies.
Yeah, but if I'd have done that, I would have probably enjoyed going to college, which I didn't enjoy because I was doing subjects I hated like history and government and politics.
So, yeah, about the shitty essays you would have written about Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Oh, that is true, actually, by not doing that. We have spared the world that basically, and I can instead charge for the same thing on the Excel tier of this podcast.
Yeah. Wait till you hear my Fight Club take anyway.
What about you, Matthew? Yeah.
Yeah. English, it's true. I really liked, least favourite PE, obviously, I was always scanning my way out of PE because I had quite a while, still have quite bad feet, quite, I won't go into it, I have some nail issues and things.
And if I played up like how sore my feet were, I could get out of PE, very much the sort of bone spurs of its day.
You need to get yourself some New Balance trainers, Matthew, like that's they completely sorted out my feet, they're just like, fucking miraculous, 170 quid though. Oh have you? Okay, never mind then, there's no helping you.
I thought you were winding me up because you know that I bought two pairs of the same trainers the other day to future proof myself.
How much are they, your trainers?
How much are they?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I don't know, like, well I do know. How much is too much for a trainer?
Well no, like I spent 180 quid on the last two pairs I've had, like each pair.
Oh no, these were like, I buy the cheap New Balance ones, so these were like £90, but I bought two pairs of the same shoes, so, because I basically wear them out, and then I thought, well this time I'll buy two pairs, so I'm going to wear the first pair out, I've got the second pair, and like, you know, I don't want my costume to ever change for people who've seen me.
Yeah, you've got a default skin, you know, like.
I have, I'm very much like one of The Simpsons. Jeans, blue jumper, grey New Balances.
Yeah, iconic stuff really. Yeah, okay, good. So where were we with this one again?
Yeah, anyway. Shoes. I tried to get out of PE a lot.
I hate to PE. I really hated specifically chemistry. I never understood it.
I just don't get all the fucking bonds, chemical bonds, all that, all the fucking chemical equations. I never understood a fucking word of that, that completely goes over my head. What else was bad?
Most of them were fine. I quite like drama. You know, that was fun.
Yes. I used to do cooking club after school.
Cooking club?
Yeah.
Was it like Breaking Bad? Were you just there making like crystal meth with your science teacher?
No, I was there making like a delicious Tex-Mex casserole.
That sounds pretty good, actually.
And like biscuits.
You never made that for me. Okay, very good.
You know, because then you're like, I can become like the source of my own, you know, food. I can make the things. That's quite empowering.
Catherine will hate listening to this because I don't fucking cook at all.
Your fridge like has so few items in it. That's what I observe whenever I've been around your house. It's like, because I'm getting to that point now where I'm like, I have takeouts, take out more than I should.
And I'm like, I feel like I'm worried that I'm only making three meals a week for myself now. How did they get this bad? Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, that's all right.
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, good. I think we've answered that one, Matthew.
So okay, so someone, the first question someone asked about in relation to this one, Matthew, was someone asked what our favorite big supermarket was. And I had no good answers to that really. I like, I like a browse around a Waitrose, but I never spend more than 20 quid.
Do you know what I mean? And even if I spent 20 quid, that would just be like some smoked salmon or something because the prices are out of control. But I don't normally go in for like dried meats, that sort of thing.
Like the vaguely good cheese is there and, you know, like the sort of sushi counter is pretty good. So I like that. But do you have any takes on the big supermarkets?
There'll be nothing to anyone outside the UK anyway.
Well, like obviously I started reviewing the big supermarkets on reviews.
That's like one of your jobs now.
Yeah, it is one of my jobs. I'm always getting pinged about how popular my reviews are. Finally, it wasn't my career as a games critic, but as a Sainsbury's critic.
Yeah, I mean Sainsbury's because it's on the way home. I quite like the chocolate chip cookies in Morrison's at the bottom of town.
Oh, yeah. One of the two Morrison's as established. There are two Morrison's.
That's basically my take.
Okay, that follows on to this next question from Vegetable Tart. He seems very nice. What is your favourite thing from the Lidl bakery?
I've never been in a Lidl.
The Lidl bakery is a bit like dog eat dog in there. It's a bit like chaotic. I first started going to that Lidl during the pandemic, and the vibes were not good, because there are lots of students and they're not wearing masks.
I don't think the vibes were good anywhere in a pandemic. I don't think it's fair to judge a place's vibes based on what its vibes are like in the pandemic.
No, but you know there was that certain contempt from students where they were like, we don't need to wear masks because we're not going to die if we get COVID, so fuck you. There was that vibe from students, do you know what I mean? Where they were like, we're straight back to the pubs because we're paying like, I don't know, like 20 grand a year just to even go to a pub.
That's basically like why we're here. So they were like straight back in there. And I was a bit like, well, I'm in my 30s and COVID probably won't be great for me, but I would rather not die if possible.
So obviously Little attracts a lot of students as a little bit of that. But the bakery is quite chaotic anyway. You arrive there and it will seem like, I don't know, people have just knocked shit everywhere and it's a bit chaotic.
But look, the answer is croissant, okay? This is good. So that's it.
That was a big build up to croissant.
It was. Next question, Matthew. Shall I read this one?
Yeah, I will actually. As the pod approaches its third year of existence with many enjoyable takes, some truly wonderful moments of podcast enjoyment, pumped listeners in-house references, a collection of truly exceptional guest interviews, anecdotes galore, loads of content, this very broad spread of a Discord and a Patreon with all of its excellent additional content. What do you guys think would have been a success when you went out to start this pod?
Was there a point where you realized you'd be on to something? All the best for the next year of the pod and long may it continue. It's from Ryan Cobain.
So I think that for me that I came into it thinking we needed that game review scores. We got wrong episode to kick things off. It needed something with a little bit of bite that we couldn't get anywhere else.
It was specifically tied to our sort of mag heritage. And I think that was that, you know, if you compare that first episode of PS5 versus Xbox Series X, which is notoriously shit. And we tried doing it again on the XL tier.
It was even worse. Just a fucking disaster across the board. And then we charged for it the second time.
Sorry about that, listeners. We made some good stuff since then, I think. It was, you know, but that game review scores got wrong.
That was like our personalities could come out. We could be a bit feistier. We could sort of like, you know, discuss loads of random, weird stuff, which is what we do a lot on this podcast.
So that felt like the one to me. But, you know, the fact that it's made us any money that anyone cares, because as people are pointing out, this is like basically when this is going live, this is a week out from the third year anniversary, Matthew, of the podcast. Like that's I just think it's amazing we have an audience.
So I do treasure it. And because Matthew's pointed out, this is the most organically popular thing that either of us have ever made. So we're just keen to hold on to it, not make it rubbish.
Hence why we're taking a month off so we can make sure it's good next year. But what about you, Matthew? Was there a point where you realized it was it was really clicking?
No, I guess like there's certain people, certain peers who, like, if they're into it, I'm kind of like, I feel good about it. You know, I want the approval of certain people.
Joe is a big advocate for us.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, that the right people seem to be into it was good. I mean, you do live in kind of constant fear of, you know, jumping the shark. And, you know, that's that's, you know, it will it will happen.
Maybe it has happened. Maybe it's happened this episode when I talked about Pret in a hot rap in fucking tediously granular detail.
About ten minutes of the podcast.
Oh, not bad. That was rough going. Man, I am so tired for a Tuesday.
Sorry, I've really I've made Matthew go and go with this one.
I was like, no, no, but it's fine. You know, this list of stuff Ryan has here, you know, it's really nice that all that stuff resonates. I'm really pleased with the variety of the podcast.
Like, I'm really pleased, you know, the guests who've given us their time and come on to it. I just like the mix of it. You know, I think if it was just one of, you know, the various strands which we've baked into it, I don't think that that would work for me as well.
So, yeah, I'm just glad that people put up with the kind of, you know, site grab bag style of it, I guess.
Yeah, I think, you know, the grab bag style of it is sort of my doing a little bit like I, you know, I sort of... Something that happens to me basically is whenever I've had moments in like job stuff, but the last, since we've been doing the podcast basically on TechRadar or whatever, I've been like, okay, I can switch off my work brain doing things that are like more work oriented and then my basically like creativity kicks in and like what fun stuff can we do? Having that as a thing to like just turn on the last few years has been so much fun because I don't work in games editorial anymore, but I love, obviously I have big editorial instincts and that stuff stays with me.
So I like this podcast to reflect that. I'd like to do some new episode formats next year as well. Matthew talked a little bit about some to mix it up.
So yeah, like it's just been great fun to keep making. But if Matthew wasn't into it, I'd stop doing it, but Matthew's enjoying it still too. So yeah, it's all good really.
How can I not enjoy it when I get to tell everyone my exciting plans to rob a bank with Sergeant Baff?
Set people on fire, great stuff. Okay, so this is a similar vein Matthew, I'll read out this question as well. In a similar vein, as the podcast approaches its third year of existence with many enjoyable takes, et cetera, are there any White Whales remaining subjects you want to get into or episode ideas you'd want to do if only you had the right guest, slash time, slash money, slash Steel Battalion controllers?
That's from Serrano. So my first, I have a few answers to this Matthew, but why don't you go first actually?
So a huge hole in our, in our guests we've had have been Nintendo Magazine people, which I'm very, very aware of. And like each person I've tried to organize to get on for a very specific reason hasn't been able to do it. Annoyingly, a lot of people who I used to work with work on, work at like games companies or things which are just, they're just too successful to be able to come on and talk shit about video games with us, sadly.
So like being able to talk to like N64, NGC people are kind of people I have a connection to, but Sam doesn't necessarily like that. That's entirely on me. So that's a thing I really want to get on top of.
Like, I feel like we've, you know, we've properly like broken down Zelda over the years. There's definitely Mario to be done. I always resist it.
I don't know why, but like a big, thorough, epic Mario ranking feels like something that will happen at some point. The Game Boy Advanced Draft, which has become a big psychological block for me for reasons I don't know. I mean, you know, your dream get in anyway, you know, you know, I love talking to other journalists, but you know, if we could get on people behind some of the games we really love and in the right headspace, like I love talking to Jamie about that kind of game design know-how and to like be able to talk about that with people behind, you know, other games we like as well.
That would be really cool. So yeah, a sort of vague pool of things. Mario is probably the biggie.
Like, you know, I was really pleased with the big Zelda retrospective things we've done, but we should do that for Mario too at some point.
Yeah, so we did do the moments thing on the XL, but that felt like a bit more sort of like half measured, didn't it? Yeah, so I think there is the mirror of that excellent Zelda episode you did a couple of years ago, Matthew, to be done for sure. So yeah, I think there's actually I've got loads I still want to do.
So obviously I want to do the Game of the Year 2002 to 2005 pods because that 2001 one was great fun. I'm not in a rush to do 2017 onwards because I think that will cover a lot of territory we're already quite familiar with. So I would like to redo the 2020 Game of the Year pod though.
At some point we did like threaten that at some point that we will go back and do that because that was actually like a low key amazing year for games. And at the time, I don't think we appreciate it as such. And now I've completed basically all the games that came out that year.
I'd like to talk about it again at some point. That'd be cool. I'd like to do a Red Dead episode when I finished Red Dead Redemption 2 finally.
That'd be nice. I'd like to do Two Giant Men, replay GTA 4, because GTA 6 is obviously bubbling up, so there's probably more potential to do GTA stuff next year. I'd also like to do San Andreas' 20th anniversary episode.
That'd be quite cool because that game is just singular, obviously with its scale for the PS2. I'd like to do another episode on covers. Me and Matthew talked about that.
I've not done one of those for a long time, but I think that'd be fun to talk a bit more about our mag stuff. Dragon Age, I'd like to do, because there's going to be a fourth one of those next year. There's going to be...
There's also... I'd like to do a Persona episode at some point, or maybe an Atlus episode, maybe to tie into that metaphor, re-Fantasia, or whatever the fuck that game is called. That'd be cool.
Or just one of the... Or the Persona 3 remake, something like that. I'd love to talk a bit about just their very particular identity that they have in the RPGs they make.
Matthew mentions, GBA draft would be good. PS1 draft would be good as well. I'd like to have more Edge editors on the podcast.
Obviously, Tony Mott is our white whale, really. We'd love to have him on. But we've never asked him, I don't think.
But we should start asking him, really, because we've had... All the Edge editor episodes we've done have been fantastic. So that'd be good.
We'd like to do... We've done obviously the MGS2 and MGS3 pods. We'd like to do MGS1 and MGS4.
We'd like to play those and have raw impressions of those and discuss those with Matthew. If the FF7 Disc 1 pod goes well, obviously we'll do Disc 2 and 3. That'd be cool.
PS2 Redraft, we've threatened that for a long time. We've just never really tried to gather the people for that one. But by the time we end up doing it, Matthew, it would have been three years since we did that original episode.
So plenty of time to talk about the PS2 again. I feel like we've refined that draft format so the first half's a lot better than it used to be.
I think we've been making this pod long enough that we can start doing gritty reboots of previous episodes too.
Yeah, that's it. But I always keep one eye on the future because I think talking about present day stuff, that's why I've never really let it become just a retro podcast because I like being engaged with games as they are now because I don't want to believe that the best days of games are behind us. I want to believe they're ahead.
Both of us are always excited and interested in new things, so that will always be part of the mix as well. Hence why we really like doing what we've been playing. They're a nice pause.
People do like listening to them. They are some of our most popular episodes. So that's good, but it's just about the mix, like Matthew says.
So yeah, plenty still left to do. PC Redraft, I might try to do with Jeremy Peele and Phil Awanyuk, who did our PC Gaming Classics miniseries, which now everyone's listened to on the Free Feed and really liked. They were great.
Phil, actually, he will be a really good guest to have on this podcast. He's a very charismatic, fun dude, much better looking than me and Matthew, regrettably.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. So yeah, those are the things we might try and do next year. So please look forward to it.
Matthew, that's the end of the episode. So we'll be back next week with a new episode. What is next week's episode, Matthew?
I've forgotten it.
It's a licensed games draft.
Oh yeah, a draft episode. That's fun.
I have no fucking idea what that is.
No, I'll send you some categories after this so you can think about it. But I've got some ideas. It's going to be good.
If you think I'm replaying any licensed games for that.
No, it's okay.
Another thing is coming this time.
Thank you for setting expectations for me and the listeners as low as possible.
No, no, I'm going to just... I'll remember them. These games are so good, they're burnt in the mind.
So that's good. And then on the XL tier, we will have the David Fincher movies ranked as well.
Oh, that's going to be intolerable, isn't it?
Yeah, it is. It's a really unsufferable end to the patron content for 2023. So that's good.
But yeah, if you'd like to send us questions for future episodes, backpagegames.gmail.com if you'd like to email us. And then there's the channel on the Discord as well. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I'm at MrBazzle UnderscorePesto on Twitter, and I am at MrBazzleNo UnderscorePesto on Blue Sky.
Matthew's got no fucking Blue Sky content. I've seen it. He's complaining about engagement.
I don't know what to do. Do I post it on both places? I don't know how to do it.
I don't know what to do with it.
I got unfollowed on Blue Sky the other day, and I was like, that's fucking rude. That's fucking rude. There's like no content on here.
Surely like even my inane shit is better than like nothing, you know, but brutal.
Even famous people only get like 500 likes. It feels like anyone can win that place, you know?
Yeah, it does feel wrong somehow. It feels like, I don't know, just sort of like a really, it feels like, you know, you've got Paramount Plus and everyone else has got Netflix. It's just like, no one's really paying attention, but yeah, anyway.
Okay, so Matthew, the podcast is done.
