Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and joined as ever by Matthew Castle Hello. Hello, Matthew. I thought as we're doing a mailbag this month, and they're never like the richest sort of like vein of podcasting, though I enjoy doing them, I thought I would like extend things out by talking about our next draft episode a little bit. Will you allow me to do that? Will that is that okay by you?

Matthew
00:43
Yeah, I will allow you to do that. Here's an exchange. I'll allow you to do that and you've got to forgive me if you can hear my cats yowling in the room next to me. Catherine's out, which means the cats are howling at the door. Is that because they miss Catherine?

Samuel
00:55
Is that what the deal is?

Matthew
00:56
Uh yeah.

Samuel and/or Matthew
00:57
I don't know if it's they miss Catherine or they love Kibble. Hard to say really. Or hate you. I don't think they hate you.

Samuel
01:03
I think they like you. A little bit of column A, B, and C. The funniest thing when I came round to your house to play Goldeneye for that episode we just did, I um Saw your cat sort of scratching um the her little post and then just like went uh looked over while wearing my glasses. And she gave me a look of like absolute horror. Like her the shape of her eyes has completely changed and she darted off. And I was like, I just And I can sort of get I sort of get it, you know? I was sort of like, maybe I should have taken my glasses off or something, but it was a proper sort of like you don't belong here look that As much as a an animal can communicate that, you know.

Matthew
01:40
One of our cats has sort of resting terror face. Okay. It's it's just a vibe. Fair enough. Always looks like You've just found her after you've been killed by the videotape in the ring and the face is all sort of twisted into a terrifying grimace. That's just her natural state. Well I don't mind that.

Samuel
02:02
weird episode we did talking about the film Barking Dogs Um Don't Bite, um, where um there was actually a dog uncontrollably barking in the background while we were discussing that film. That was so weird that that happened, but that's life living in a block of flats, I guess. Your cats are very nice, by the way. Just shout out to your cats, they're good. Um so yes, we have uh another draft episode coming up on the second week of February, second Friday of February, um with Ashley Day and Dave Scarborough. We do these quarterly at this point, mainly to stop Matthew from going completely mad because he has to do the edits. And um something always goes wrong um with with the recording. Um so that's part of it. But um I thought I'd read out the categories, Matthew, because we've agreed those via email. Or at least no one's really complained about them, so I think they're pretty much set. So it's gonna be the best um video game levels draft. Um I'm looking forward to this. So uh an episode all about specific levels in different games, uh the categories are First person shooter level, brackets single player, first person shooter level, brackets multiplayer, light gun stage, multiplayer level, brackets non-fps A platforming level, mission in an open world game or larger game, bonus level, boss battle, worst level and location I doom my worst enemy to live in, and free pick. How are you feeling about this draft, Matthew?

Matthew
03:18
Yeah, it's good.

Samuel and/or Matthew
03:19
Light gun level, I think, is very Ash decoded.

Samuel
03:23
It is that's like every draft though, there's a category I have to like I give to Ash as like a kind of It's like I'm meeting him halfway on his interest. That's why the Amiga category ended up in that last draft. Although that category did go down very well, so that was a good call. Um yeah. Dave Scarborough did suggest fighting game stage and you vetoed that on the basis that we've already got way too many categories, but yeah.

Matthew
03:45
Everyone knows that I don't play fighting games, so but it's like one category where I'm guaranteed to be on very thin ice and speaking with not a lot of sincerity, which, you know, not that I worry too much about who does and doesn't win these things. But it's it's not a good strategy for me to cede any ground to the fighting game community. So I am I'm really pushing back against any fighting game categories from now on.

Samuel and/or Matthew
04:08
But that g it gives you a great excuse to do your underdog shtick if you got Fine game category with Oh Old Castle on the ropes again.

Matthew
04:21
by sincere knowledge of the games. Yeah. And which is something that you know the the listeners decided whether or not I agree about Ash Tay. best sort of embodied in the podcast. So uh yeah, I I can't have another draft where I'm like, uh I guess I'm taking uh Tekken because uh I've heard it's good and No one wants that. I don't want that.

Samuel
04:46
Yeah, I did um sort of I did think it was so I think I was second place in that draft and I was I thought my picks are really good in the end. Um and I think that You could put my list next to his list side by side. I think they're kind of like it's re it really is sort of 50-50. But his knowledge was like undoubtedly it just carried that episode. So um I don't um begrudge him the victory. But uh this one's gonna be a bit more uneven ground. There's a lot you can do with these categories. It's not um I think there are some levels in some games that will be obvious picks and therefore vote winners, which you and I might race to get while Dave Scarborough's picking some Ghostbusters nonsense. He'll be like, Oh will you will you fight the marshmallow man in Times Square and Ghostbusters two thousand nine and we all laugh at him um because it's funny that he did that.

Samuel and/or Matthew
05:33
Um yeah just to clarify. When you've picked a level from a game, that game's off the table.

Samuel
05:38
Oh well that's a that's a good rule. We should incl I think we should include that. That's good.

Matthew
05:42
Because otherwise it could be, you know, if four people pick f you know, four great platforming levels from our galaxy, that feels a little redundant.

Samuel
05:49
Yeah, you're right, Ashley. Let's do that then. And it makes it just makes the episode more interesting as well. So yeah, okay, raising the stakes, I like it, because yeah, I think it is I did worry it'd be a bit formless. I almost brought forward the N64 GameCube one because I thought, well, that's an easy, easy sell to our listeners and I know it'll be good. But then I thought I like uh well we did the Japanese game developer one, I I like the idea of a bit of more of a conceptual draft, you know, where you have to think about it laterally. So I like that Matthew. So there's the categories. And we will introduce the rule like Matthew says there. Once the game's picked, it cannot be picked again. That's some good shit. I'm looking forward to that. So yes, that's coming next month And um yes, there's uh another is an interview episode coming next month as well that I think people will like a returning guests, all being well, and um some other stuff that I can't remember, but it'll be uh it'll be good, um a good time. Oh yeah, the XL bangers. Yeah, and a Patreon episode on the um the GTA four DLCs um to accompany this month's episode on GTA four. So Yeah, good stuff Matthew. So we come to the mailbag and we've had a bunch of questions. I will say actually with this episode we've got to the bottom of the pile of questions. So we are Inviting more for the next time we do a mailbag, probably in like March or April or something. Backpagegames at gmail. com if you'd like to email us. um or you can go into the Discord which is linked in our Blue Sky and Twitter um profiles and join there and you can go into the um uh I can't remember what it's called now, pod questions, that's it. You can drop a question in there. I scan through there and that's how I assemble the documents for these um for these episodes. And uh yeah, so that's it. Just um any questions you want to ask us, like the more sort of like a game or sort of games journalism focused ones tend to get the best answers from us, but uh people will still ask like or what's the best microwaveable chips? And then we're expected to give a very sincere answer to that. Um but um yes. Um I the odd fun one is fine too, but um yes.

Matthew
07:40
Each one of your five fingers has been turned into a chocolate bar. Yeah, can you put them in order and this kind of thing?

Samuel
07:47
Yeah, they're all just sort of like these weird dream logic food related things that I don't find myself sitting at my desk late at night going

Samuel and/or Matthew
07:54
Do I want my thumb to be a Fredo or not? And on that note, Matthew, let's come to the first question. Do you want to read this out?

Matthew
08:01
Hello, giant juicy lads. Please can you tell me three of your favourite 9 out of 10 games? I'm especially interested to hear why you love them, but also what makes them not 10 out of 10 games. That's from Stevie.

Samuel
08:16
I love this question, um, because the idea of differentiating between scores. I think what you've discussed this in the past, Matthew, is um you just know in your gut that it's the score is right and that that is a big part of why you give a game a certain score. Is that is that how you feel about this more generally?

Matthew
08:33
Yeah I think yeah I think so. I think we've got another question about scores a bit later in the episode so we can do some more score chat but Yeah, I mean it's it's tricky. I guess he he said favourite nine out of ten games, which helps, because you know, three nine out of ten games, there are, you know, hundreds of the things How did you get on with this?

Samuel
08:52
Yeah, so um three, uh it was I I wanted to like dig a little deeper than just games we talked about in the last few years of the podcast. So um went well no that's fine too. But like um I I came up with a I got like four basically. Um so if you want one from if you want one for the recent past, then Jedi Survivor is definitely a nine out of ten for me from um recent years. And um Uh Bayonetta is another one, the original Bayonetta. And um I also had uh original Dishonored for this. I could be talked into Dishonored 2 being a ten out of ten I think 'cause it's very much like the the top level, uh top level level of its craft. And then um Metal Get Solid 4, the Phantom Pain, Matthew had us nines as well. And I suppose like Metal Get Solid 4 or Phantom Pain. Did I say 4? I said I thought I said five. Anyway, okay. Melga Solid 5, The Phantom Pay. No, 4 isn't getting a 9 out of 10. That's like uh we'll s we'll have to see how that comes out in the wash when the HD collection uh volume two comes along, but Uh it will it will not be a nine, I'll tell you that. Um yeah, so Phantom Paint, and I guess like I'd describe it as as firm a recommendation as you can get while reserving The 10 out of 10 for the cro for crowning the elite of the elite. So I've talked about this before, but I gave out very few tens when I review games. Um so I was sort of like um I did give Grand Theft Daughter 4 uh a 95 and then it was changed to a 98. Um and I guess you could argue that's a 10 um on the basis of percentages. And then I gave um Mass Effect 2 a 10 out of 10. And Grand Theft Auto 5 are 10 out of 10. And I think those are all really good calls because they're sort of like saying in their moment these are the most important games. And like I think scarcity is key to the value of a ten. Um if you're giving them out all the time, then I think it becomes more interchangeable with a nine. But if you do save them for those occasions, like I'm saying, then um then yes. I would say with the nines I've picked there. There's at least like one or two things in all cases where you would say that they're there's a reason there's they're not like a they're not a ten out of ten. Like the original Dishonored is amazing in its f first two thirds and then that last third's a little bit stranger. And then in the second one they just keep the structure of that, the first two thirds of the first one, and therefore it's a better game. Bayonetta is um has like a couple of like non combat levels are just just okay, which is alright. And still a great game. Metal Get Solid 5, the Phantom Pain, sort of like there's a bit it's a bit odd how the game sort of like presents a story, I would say, is a is a big sort of like mark against that one. Otherwise like an amazing game also. So yeah, I guess like there's there's a a reasonable There are like caveats that would stop them from being crowned tens to me. Whereas the games I mentioned that are tens. I don't think anyone would argue that GTA V and Mass Fight 2 w weren't tens in their moment, you know? What do you think?

Matthew
11:48
There are sometimes games where I think there's nothing wrong with this, but like the core idea doesn't excite me like a 10 out of 10. Like the most this game could ever be is a nine. Like I don't think every game has the capacity to be a ten, just based on its ambitions or core idea. Uh do you agree with that or is that bullshit?

Samuel
12:07
No, I I I I do get that. Like um can you ever be so surprised by the sort of like how the game works inside its those parameters to give you like a a ten. What's the example of a like a game like a I guess like the container for a game where you're like a nine is the limit for this?

Matthew
12:26
Well I mean, I would say like everything in this genre, but it's quite hard for like visual novels, for example, to break out of that because I like if you review them like if you're a visual novel specialist and you're reviewing like within the genre, say you run a website that covers visual novels, then yes, you've got the full scale of it. But there's something quite hard about, you know, getting away with like Trying to give Shabira scramble a ten in edge, for example, it just feels like that that couldn't happen and that wouldn't ever happen. Right. It feels like it tops out at nine. I mean I it i it's a b it's a difficult thing to put your finger on and maybe that is completely wrong but I I definitely I don't know maybe that's just the thing I police myself with, actually, thinking about it. Maybe I just sort of think, well, this is you know, what more can you do with this really? But at the same time, you know, I'm not saying a ten out of ten is like a universal experience, but I guess it is the gut feeling. You know it when you see it.

Samuel
13:29
Yeah, I think the gut the gut feeling is such a a key part of it. Like all the games I reeled off there are my criteria. That's you know, it's just personal, you may completely disagree with that. And um Yeah, it does come down to you know these uh these things are subjective, so yeah.

Matthew
13:41
I th I I would agree with all your noise. The the only one I I think maybe is closer to a ten is Melgia Solid five. Just because I think mechanically it's kinda like peerless as a stealth game. But but but it it doesn't deliver on the Kojima story stuff that y that you might love. Like there's a version of that game which has both and is, you know, maybe even more special.

Samuel
14:07
Yeah, that's the thing. I I could be talked into it getting uh a 10. I just gave it um I think I gave it ninety-three for PC Gamer and I do think it's amazing. I mean if you look at the it's a game where there's weirdly not that much heritage from it. Um but then you play something like I guess Death Stranding kind of is like a follow-on, especially the second one, from what you've told me about it. But Helldivers 2 is a game that takes so much inspiration from it in terms of player movement. It's a game that if you've played MGS V, then you feel trained into um playing um Helldivers 2 and understanding it. So um you know it just shows that the developers of um Arrowhead have like incredible taste I would say.

Matthew
14:43
But yeah.

Samuel
14:44
Um but we didn't get your nines, Matthew, your favorite nines?

Matthew
14:47
One of my favourite nines, I'd say Red Dead Redemption 1. When you boil it down, like for all its strengths, it is quite a one note action game underneath it all. I'd say the same with Red Dead Redemption 2, actually. Uh you know, I th and that may actually also be a nine to me. Interesting. Just because I feel like every gunfight from the first to the last is exactly the same, like the thinking, the tactics, the feel, all those things feel great. But it it just doesn't really go anywhere as a game. But that is within that kind of perfectly realised fantasy of, you know, Digital Westworld and that absolutely rules. But I think shooting humans again and again isn't always particularly thrilling.

Samuel
15:30
Yeah, that's uh I think I agree with you on Red Dead One. Like I actually did almost throw that in here as a

Matthew
15:36
As an entry.

Samuel
15:36
Um I bet everyone always fucking complains about Mexico.

Matthew
15:39
It bucked me a little bit when Ed sh did that feature about Nines that should have been tens and pick Red Dead. 'Cause I was I've never been more convinced of one of my edge scores than the nine for Red Dead one.

Samuel
15:51
I don't think it is like the I think it's it I think even by Like if you just put it next to GTA 5, I think GTA 5 is like such an obvious 10 out of 10 game for just what it achieved in this moment. And Red Dead is like Red Dead is so close. Um, but I yeah, I think I do agree with you about the repetition of it. Not all parts of it as strong as other parts, like the overall kind of what it did. in terms of being a Western open world game it delivered on massively. But I think a nine's fine. A nine is not in any way.

Samuel and/or Matthew
16:22
It's still great. It's still great. Fundamentally a horse isn't as interesting as a sports car. So what are your other two Matthew?

Matthew
16:30
I put down Marion Luigi Bowser's inside story. Alright. Um like the Mario RPG format has severe limitations. By Mario RPG I can include Paper Mario and Mario and Luigi in this. in that the combat is a bit more like a puzzle where you have to kind of react to enemy turns and there's a you know a quick time event element to it and all that stuff's thrilling but when you actually get to the grind of doing fights again and again It's it's actually quite a flawed format. Again, it's you know repetition, which which gets me down. But I do think of all of them, and the reason Bowser's Inside Story comes up quite a bit on this podcast, is that I th you know the the art of these games is like how much can you distract from that repetitive loop at the heart? And this one, because you sort of spend half your time as the m you know, Marion Luigi inside Bowser and half the time it's Bowser outside. I think it can just sort of change tone, change the kind of mechanics of the fight, like within each of those paths. There's lots of variations. You know, it it it it really is uh you know a game where you just have to keep throwing distractions in front of people like every five minutes. or like the whole thing kind of collapses in on itself and for me this is this is the one which which does it best. Um so and I gave that a I'm pretty sure I gave that a a a 90 exactly in in gamer as well. So it's probably why it jumped out as like a definitive nine to me.

Samuel
17:59
Hmm. That's interesting.

Matthew
18:01
Yeah. And more recently, because I don't know if I did play a 10 out of 10 last year, uh, I would pick Donkey Kong Bonanza as a 9. Incredible art design, game feel, music, attitude. Like I I loved just about everything about this game, but I do think the difficulty curve and how it handles challenge is a little bit off. I just think it probably because they're having to design the game for like the worst case scenario Donkey Kong based on like how many unlocks you have. That's They don't necessarily predict you're gonna spend time collapsing every level in on itself, buying all the upgrades, and it just means you can monster through most of the game. And it's not until the very end, like the last couple of stages and the postgame challenges that there's really any difficulty in particular, I think. And I would just like that game to have a kind of a smoother arc through it. I'd like to feel a little bit more challenged earlier on. I think that's what kind of like holds it back from Ariodice where they just have so much more control over you know, Mario is Mario in every level and that's easier to build challenges for, but Donkey Kong is a you know, quite a difficult thing in that game. So I can understand the why it is the way it is. I just uh yeah. That's that's the thing that sort of sticks in my craw every time I go back to it.

Samuel
19:25
Yeah, it's almost annoying for me that game, but it just um It's probably like a I have it like right between an eight and a nine for me, bonanza. But that's only because I can hear it.

Samuel and/or Matthew
19:40
You sort of Um, it's sort of like uh maybe if that DLC was included for free, Matthew, and not paid, but um no, I mean I think the problem is You can't put a DLC that good in a game for free. What? I mean, the thing is, um, oh no, we're not gonna get into this. You dis you disrespect the people who made that mode

Samuel
20:03
And um if they did the same thing with Astrobot Matthew and it transformed the game similarly, would you give that its flowers as well?

Samuel and/or Matthew
20:10
Astrobot gave you free DLC and it it speaks to its freeness.

Matthew
20:14
By being merely fine. If it's really excellent, they would charge you for it.

Samuel and/or Matthew
20:20
I'm sure they'd charge you for it if it was really essential. Amazing. Anyway, the point I was gonna make was The point I was gonna make

Samuel
20:28
was just that um basically that it's too inconsistent as a game. Like not all sections of the game are as strong as other sections. Like already already as the game's fading into sort of like the rear view mirror I there are like three or four levels that stand out above the others. Um and that's that's okay because it's their first attempt at this new kind of like platforming, smashing shit up, character game sort of like paradigm basically. It's their first it's their first run at it. It's okay that it's not perfect. And I think that th you know, if they have another go at it, I think they'll get to a nine or ten for sure. Um but I really admire that they did it and I you know, I I I sort of don't Disagree with a nine necessarily because I would tell everyone with a Nintendo Switch two to to play this and I would say it's a great reason to earn a Nintendo Switch two and dis That alone sort of like speaks to its neneness, this fundamental nineness. So uh it's been a fun question. I've enjoyed this. Um that's your you've done three now, right?

Matthew
21:21
So we should move on to the next question.

Samuel and/or Matthew
21:22
All right, that was good. I'll throw in a fourth. Astrobot, there you go, a peace offering. That's also a nine. You don't believe that. You believe that's an eight eighty-two.

Samuel
21:31
What I'm hearing is eighty-two, Matthew. That's what I'm hearing. 82 Okay, moving on then. Um This is from SAFC uh Jack 91. After hearing about JRPG heads playing the victim about being underrepresented on the alternative game of the year awards, once again me taking a swipe at an audience, which is Just become a bit of a pattern on this podcast. Um, surely the real victims are point-and-click fans, a former mainstay now managed almost exclusively by indies. What would a triple A point-and-click game look like today? Uh it's true that there are still loads of these games. I mean I think that people who make games in the indie space around you know in this genre are annoyed that people say every year there are no more point-and-click games when they're making them. And that's like uh Tridon so everyone's bored of that discourse now. And so um fair enough.

Matthew
22:20
I say combine Kleenex with eyes.

Samuel
22:23
I would say that life is strange in Detroit Or like other quantic dream games do have their bones and point and click. Like if you wanna look where the sort of big big budget, you know w Basically like what the games would have been back then. Like even I know dispatch doesn't actually have any pointing and clicking, but I would say that the type of game it is is still in the evolutionary chain with those because it it links back to Telltale, which itself is point and click like it's it's kind of split off in these different directions. But what do you think, Matthew, genre expert?

Matthew
22:57
I can't speak for other point and click fans, but I think what got me into the genre so much as a kid and a teenager was probably more the narrative stuff, it was like the worlds and the stories and the characters and the humor of the things. Like I don't know if I loved them because I loved doing really strange puzzles. If anything, really strange puzzles often got in the way of L just enjoying the story and being excited about the story. And that's not entirely true. I understand there's a role wherein there's there's some satisfaction in some of them. But I yeah I can see a like a through line of the narrative dweebs enjoying point and click games go on to be the major y users for narrative games more broadly. And I'd argue, you know, that yeah, there are loads of indie point and click now and actually they're made to a standard that matches what would have been the triple A point and click games of the nineties. Like there's stuff in the Drifter, for example, last year, which, you know, I think is a pretty small outfit putting that together. And You know, that's to me feels as flashy and expensive and polished as Day of a Tentacle. or um full throttle, you know. It it like maybe it's a genre that like didn't need to grow. Like where the th where pointing clicks begin to falter as a genre in my eyes, was when they felt the need to become 3D games. You know, we had that that kind of generational awkwardness where people felt like If you weren't making 3D games, you know, 2D games were getting marked down in magazines for feeling a bit old-fashioned and backwards and old hat. you know, they got a bit of a chip on their shoulder. Gwynfandango, you know, an interesting attempt to, you know, have that kind of 3D character animation in those more traditional baked in backgrounds. But I you know, aside from like Monkey Island 4, which was a bit of a duffer, some of the broken sword games in 3D, like I don't think it's a it it wasn't necessarily a genre that needed to grow up and become more complicated. but in a world where everything is driven by the potential for growth and the opportunity to for for something to just sell you know endless copies the little kind of baked in audience you do have for point and click games I don't think's enough. Really, if you were going to do a triple A point and click game now, whatever that means. It just means pumping so much budget into it. Having like an animation team where it it you know it has like th the life and energy of a cup head or something. There's something that looks so truly extraordinary that it can only have been made by 500 human hands toiling for years and years and years, but I don't think you need to do that. I think you can hit the beats a good point-and-click game needs to hit. on a much smaller budget. It's why some of the best point and click games ever made have been made in the last few years by the Drifter team or WadgetI, you know, i it's uh Yeah, it's just unnecessary. I think I agree with that.

Samuel
26:01
As someone who back in the day one of my sort of like ill advised cheapo play dot com Xbox purchasers was Broken Sword, the Sleeping Dragon, whatever that one was called. The It was such a boring game that. That's like the most bored I've ever been, I think, playing that. Um just wandering around those near empty streets, just being like this is so dull, um having the worst time. So um I think I agree, Matthew, that um it it's uh it's a genre where the limitations are not really a huge problem. It's a good take. Okay. All right, next question. You want to read this out? Big boys.

Matthew
26:36
A lady in Japan has married a cardboard cutout of Kiryu from Like a Dragon. Well actually she hasn't, but that's neither here nor there. Okay. Uh is there a video game character whose cardboard cutout would help you in your daily lives or on special occasions, e. g. Christmas? As giant men, I'm guessing it might be awkward to have a figure you can't both literally and metaphorically look up to. That's from our superior. What a strange question.

Samuel
27:04
It is quite strange. Um so I sort of every mailbag I feel the need to like One person who's I've never seen a question for from before in that channel. I'm like, I don't want them to feel left out um even though I don't really want to answer it. And this is one of those questions really, but like But you know I which c which cobwhat character cutout do you want? Well, I did have a story connected to this. So a couple of years ago we were walking I was talking back from a a film with a friend, uh, and it was late at night and I was going down one of Bar side streets. And um someone uh and we like looked up because it seemed like there was someone at like a window watching us and with a light behind them. But it turned out it was just a cardboard cutout that someone had put by their window. And it shat us up so much. Oh we just w we because we both started at the same time, what the fuck is that? Like just sort of like someone staring down at you Um and that's just our overim active imaginations at work there. Obviously it was fine. It was there for like a week longer than it went, I don't know why. Um but with that in mind, I think that a scare is the best use of this. Like um I don't want like a cardboard cut of a woman or anything like that. Um I'll refer you to the very comical uh COVID ass story of um Ben Affleck um chucking out I think actually it was Casey Affleck who was chucking out a cardboard cutout of Anna Diamas after Ben Affleck broke up with her. It's just a great thing that happened um in our times. I think that's a weird cutout to have

Matthew
28:27
Even during a relationship as a child of the person you see.

Samuel
28:31
Yeah, but I like the idea that he has that and when once the relationship's over it has to go. So I imagine he had another one of J J Lo that he had to just get rid of when they divorced again.

Matthew
28:40
I don't know, but um I had a cardboard cutout of Uma Thurman from Killball Volume One of like her and her Yellow biker suit. It was so it was a video rental shop was throwing out some stuff. It was only like half height. It like came up to my waist. So it's this like tiny Uma Thurman who was in my university room and like house and uh for those three years. Um

Samuel and/or Matthew
29:05
Maybe why I was permanently alone. Did anyone did anyone taunt you say, Oh Matthew and his tiny tiny girlfriend? Did you get any of that kind of thing?

Matthew
29:13
No, I 'cause I was like a film guy. That was like my persona at at university. I was known as a film guy. So it made sense that I would have strange things like a three for Uma Thurman.

Samuel and/or Matthew
29:25
I wanna believe that Peter Bradshaw's house is full of like point of sale displays of DVDs are over the years.

Matthew
29:31
Yeah, but of like slightly more sophisticated fair, so it'd be like a black and white character from like a Finnish art house film.

Samuel
29:39
Anyway to answer this question, so I thought about that Halloween's probably the best time for this sort of thing, and I'd I'd spook people similarly to how I was spooked. And I'd get Lisa from PT as a cardboard cutout and just pop her at the window there, put the light on in the background while I'm just, you know, watching Seinfeld or something, and then just like leave it, leave it to her really. A That's the only real use I could think of in answer to this question, Matthew. How about you?

Matthew
30:01
Well I was thinking more along the lines of using cardboard cutouts to make it look like my house was populated when I'm on holiday, like the kid in home alone. when he has all the the models sort of dancing in the window behind the curtains. So I'd probably just pick someone who was just a regular human, because I think if it's like too weird a shape, people would be like Well that's obviously a goron from the server. So there's probably not someone in there, let's go and rob it. Um but if it was so I picked I was trying to think of the most

Samuel and/or Matthew
30:31
just regular human I could think of, and for some reason I thought of um the G Man from Half Life. He does have big IT guy energy, the G Man.

Matthew
30:42
Yeah, but he also has like disapproving stare, so you could have him in the window like poking his head around the curtains to s to make sure no one's doing anything bad to the cars parked opposite our house. So G-Man has that energy. Are you trying to Break into Catherine's car.

Samuel
30:58
Maybe like as they get closer, like you see um the outline of Barney from Half-Life 2 as well with a machine gun, and you're like, shit, they're not playing around. I better get out of here. And then like it turns out you have the entire Half-Life 2 extended universe in your um in your house uh of various windows, Matthew.

Matthew
31:13
Alright, I like that. Uh you talking about seeing uh cutout and it shitting you up has actually unlocked a memory for me of one time we were driving to Catherine's house and we sometimes take this weird route through like um the country's roads and we go through a small village called Schrooten mainly because we like to say Schrooten as we s in a silly voice as we drive through it. 'Cause uh that's the kind of people we are. It is though in it. But we were we were stopped at a traffic light in Shroton and we looked over to a house. And they had a life-sized cardboard cutout of Mark Heap in his Friday Night Dinners character. What? That's quite a strange guy. Um is it Jim? The one who fancies the mum. Yeah, the one who keeps turning up with the dog.

Samuel and/or Matthew
32:03
Yeah, yeah, that one, yeah. Bad hang. What a weird character to have, yeah.

Matthew
32:07
But like, yeah, what a strange thing. But s and every time we now drive through Shroton, which is every time we go to Catherine's mum's house. I always think that's where Mark Heap lives.

Samuel
32:19
I see, okay. Okay, next question. Um this from Jam Warrior I just exercised a 20-year-old personal demon by completing the Switch re-release of Baton Kytos. I fell off playing the GameCube original release three-quarters of the way through due to the disruption of a house move. For some reason the game lived on in my head all these years, nagging me that it was never finished, and I now feel spiritually lighter. Do either of the giant men have any unfinished business from video games past that haunts them? For context, I've abandoned many a game unfinished in my time. Just this one in particular always stuck with me. I don't know why. It's notable for more for being a bit unique than for being that good. Uh yes, that's the question, Matthew. Um any thoughts on this one? Like Games that you've started and never finished or abandoned things where you're like, ah, I should have gone back, that sort of thing.

Matthew
33:07
Yeah, I n I never finished Skies of Arcadia on GameCube, which I only regrets because I then sold my copy of Skies of Arcadia, not realizing it would one day be very difficult to get hold of on GameCube.

Samuel and/or Matthew
33:21
That's a good one. It's like literally the only one. Because you're pretty good at finishing games, aren't you?

Matthew
33:24
You don't really tend to meet those.

Samuel and/or Matthew
33:25
There's bound to be, but that's one like every time we mention Skies of Arcadia on the podcast.

Matthew
33:30
A little voice in the back of my head thinks, which I didn't finish because I traded it in probably for some shit.

Samuel
33:37
Yeah, fair enough Um probably for Star Wars episode 3, Revenge of the Sith or something like that. So that's what I want to believe happened, Matthew. Okay, uh so I've got loads of answers answers to this because this podcast in some ways has allowed me to uh exercise some of those demons, you know, by making episodes about them. So I mean top of the list there would be Super Mario Galaxy, GTA San Andreas and GTA Vice City. All games I played loads, but never finished them. But then we did podcasts about them, so it forced me to sit down and finish them and it was a a great time and we um we made some really good episodes out of them. So That's nice really that's kind of like that's my dream scenario really for how the podcast can be used. Um is getting through the backlog, but also um banking these um these very rich episodes on each of these games. So Yeah, but then there are others besides that I've just completely abandoned, never gone back to. So the worst one I think is Dragon Age Inquisition. So I played that. For about forty hours, pushing through the very boring opening chapters in the old uh hinterlands that no one likes, and then getting to the juicy stuff, I'd I got past the bit where that bloke turns up When when the shit gets serious and a load of people die, that bit of Dragon Age Inquisition. Um that was that was really good and I was enjoying it.

Matthew
34:52
Um but I don't know the castle with the Inquisition in it.

Samuel
34:55
Yeah, I'd met Hawk from Dragon Age 2 and all that stuff. Like I did all that and it was just kind of getting going and I don't know what happened at the time really that I just sort of abandoned it for like a year or something. So Feel like I missed my moment and now Dragon Age just feels completely over after Veilgarde. It's really sad that that's just sort of gone. So it's almost like There's not going to be a podcast-based reason to go back to it. So it'll just be have to be, I'll sit down and go through all of Dragon Age Inquisition again, which doesn't feel like it's going to happen anytime soon. So That aside, Matthew, I mean, I've got a bunch of Final Fantasy games like this. Never finished 13. Got close to the end of that one. Didn't finish six. Um haven't really got made no progress with nine, as I've discussed before. I don't I wasn't allowed to discuss nine with my ex-girlfriend because I started nine so many times and made no progress. Um no one is better at the um the sort of like dueling mini-game at the start of nine than me.

Samuel and/or Matthew
35:46
Um I'm fucking amazing at that um because I've played through it about testing games done quick the first ten minutes of Final Fantasy.

Samuel
35:54
Um and then Red Dead Red Redemption 2 is like a b a big one and um it will be tackled on a podcast later this year as we've discussed. And I would say that Tears of the Kingdom is becoming one of these, Matthew, because I played it for 30 hours and it's just sat there not being played and I have a new version of it to play, so I should get on with it. Uh well, I don't know, just y we've talked about this. It just Yeah, it it's not it doesn't have that magnetism that the first one did for me. Oh dear. Uh I won't get into that again, but um Not after you so generously gave Astrobot a nine retroactively that you did that you didn't believe anyway. Um you really have no others. There's nothing else like

Samuel and/or Matthew
36:37
an old PC game you start and you go back to like you really it's really just Skies of Arcadia for you.

Matthew
36:43
Well that well for the sake of the you know, coming up with ideas for this episode, I mean like I'm sure if if I had to ten more hours I could think of some other things which I've abandoned. But in terms of things which I actually would We'll think back on and be like Ah's a bummer that I didn't do that. That doesn't count all the games I've never started, which is you know

Samuel
37:10
Well you're much I think you're just much neater at when you start something you tend to finish it than uh than I am. I'm a bit more I think chaotic in that respect. So um that might be another key difference. Um hence me abandoning Assassin's Creed Shadows last year. Though that's not one of the games that I would I would add to this list. I'm comfortable with that. I've made peace of that. Um next question Matthew.

Matthew
37:30
Hello, what is each of your personal preference on review score systems? Are you a Guardian 5 star, Edge 10 out of 10, or PC Gamer 100% guy, or ultimately does it not matter? Does the publication score system alter how you write a review for a game? Is there another left field system that you would like to be used more, often like the Famitsu 40?

Samuel
37:57
So I like um I like all of them for different reasons. Um I had an argument recently with a friend about Letterboxd because I I will give uh films half stars on letterboxed and I'm like the half star is is considered and she just went well if I gave a film a three out of five a three point five she went so are three or gave a gave a film a four point five she went so are four And like she boils it down to it has to be on the five-star scale without half stars. That's like what it has to be. But I really don't believe that. I think that the half star on Letterbox serves a very important purpose. There is a I think there is a you know, in my head I distinguish between the 4. 5 I gave Eddington, the film Matthew didn't like, and compared to Southland Tales, um, to one battle after another, which I gave a four out of five. Um, you know, both very good films, but one I did one did resonate with me more and the half star has meaning there. Um but You know, that's uh that's just one way of looking at that kind of thing, I guess. So I guess an if you think about it that way, a ten-point scale is kind of perfect because it gives you that nuance. Um but at the same time a hundred point scale is fun, Matthew. I like it when Piece of Gamer gives me like a a 73. And my brain does round it up to the nearest, like, you know, if there's a seventy-three then I'll I'll be like, oh so it's closer to 70. I just sort of do that instinctively. But um Yeah, I don't know. And a five star scale is is severe but also makes for a great talking point. They all have their upsides. What do you think?

Matthew
39:22
We've talked a lot about scores on here. I am a big believer in the specificity of the hundred point scale. But that's because I come from games magazines which had the hundred point scale and most most you know, most of the ones I worked on did. I do think Hundred Points maybe made a little bit more sense in magazines where you could document all the scores you'd given, like you had a directory that was full of these things, and there was something quite fun about you know, a very specific breakdown of uh you know, the entire Wii library based on where it landed between one and a hundred Uh you know, that that kind of thinking tickled me back there. Also, you had quite a small pool of writers and they understood what scores had been given and I'm not saying that meant you know, on in-house stuff, you know, our uh scores on that hundred point scale were like more accurate or correct or anything. But like we you know we knew what the mag had given. You could give scores to to put something in relation to another game. Um but I to be honest, I'll work in any scale. Like if there's any commissioning editors listening, whether you use five stars, ten out of ten, one hundred you know, Carl's your guy, I'm around, you know.

Samuel
40:41
We should advertise your services more often on this podcast, Matthew. There's not enough house ads on this podcast. We should start doing house ads, shouldn't we? Just advertising Jeremy Peel.

Matthew
40:52
I I do think there you do think a little differently about sort of where to place a game maybe with like the f the five star scale. I think it you know, this is the thing I've definitely said before. I think it's really easy to give five stars. I think it's easier to give five stars than it is ten out of ten, and it's easier to give ten out of ten than it is to give a hundred percent. Like this it there's something a bit more sort of throwaway and casual about the five star system, in my mind, that makes it feel like, ah, it's five stars. Maybe because I associate it with films, which I associate with a lower buy-in of time and investment. So I'm like I don't know. Five stars fit films better for me, because it's like if it's a five or a four, you know, yeah, go and see it. It's fine. Um less at stake. It makes sense in my head

Samuel
41:42
Yeah, I feel like there's maybe it's just because seeing a film is a much more transient thing than s buying a video game. You know, buying a video game is almost always more expensive. Takes up more of your time is a more considered purchase. So, you know, a five-star film, ultimately, it all goes on the Odeon Limitless, which is 16. 99, and that's it's it's it's meaningless to me really, so it's fine. Um if I have a good time I'm pleased.

Samuel and/or Matthew
42:05
If I don't, so be it. So we both really rated Rental Family, which is a one star film according to The Guardian. Fucking hell, yeah.

Samuel
42:13
I mean I I think I gave that three and a half, and it's a really nice little film, but who knows what's going on with that guy. Completely baffling. Um but yeah, I think um Yeah, hundred point scale is fun, like I say. But I think ten point scale is perfect. That's sort of where I land with it. But um well I can say as a PR that Yeah When I s an embargo lifted on a game I worked on, and the first thing I saw was a Eurogame of five star. It was like, wow, five gold stars. It was quite uh it was quite exciting. So that's because they're gold stars. Well I can prop but what I can say is I I promise you that's a game developer. that the five star is very, very exciting and when they see that. And um yeah, I don't know, like I think that it does I think again, scarcity is the is the key thing here, like we were saying about the tens. If you don't have a five star that often, and I don't feel like Eurogamer does have five stars that often. It's normally like somewhere between two and four. Then yeah, then a five star can still like really, you know But if you see one of those every three weeks, then surely not, you know?

Matthew
43:10
But if I was a developer and I got a ninety-seven, I'd be like, holy shit, it went all the way up to ninety-seven. That's an incredible achievement. It was three off perfection. I feel so good about myself.

Samuel and/or Matthew
43:23
I'd be way more excited about that than a ten out of ten or a five stars.

Samuel
43:27
But the pro the problem is as well, we've thought about this more than maybe anyone else on the planet. And so So that is the sort of reaction that someone who is very au fay with scoring systems might have too. The specificity of a ninety-seven. Either way, Matthew, it amused me.

Matthew
43:42
I think we should we should make this into any future interviews we do with developers. or journalists is about where where they stand on this issue. What's their what's their favorite. Just to get some other perspectives other than ours for once.

Samuel
43:55
Yeah. Jamie Smith, what's more meaningful to you? A seven out of ten or a seventy-two? Asking questions the questions that the people really want to know. Okay, Matthew, next question. Um Hi Saman and Matthew, have anyone uh ever played hang on a minute. Um let me just rephrase this. Have you Ever played every game you wanted to on a certain console? Completed a console, if you will. For example, I think I have with the PS feature. There isn't one other game I can think of that I haven't played on it that I'd still want to. Some Angry Kurt. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
44:24
I have definitely played every game that I want to play or that are worth playing on the Wii U. And I would say probably Wii also.

Samuel
44:33
Oh, interesting. I did wonder if you might tick off three DS in that as well, because you were so you had your head in it so much at the time.

Matthew
44:41
I definitely did. The the problem with DS and three DS is Like the JRPG side of things. I haven't played it just because of the time investment. There are so many of those things on there. Like to be on top of all the Atlas games all the Atlas games, for example. That's what I don't have. So uh not quite. I'd say I'm like 90% of the way there. with what I want to play on DS and 3DS. Probably more so 3DS than DS. But yeah, Wii and Wii U, I'm pretty confident I've got those covered.

Samuel
45:14
Yeah, so I think for me the the three sixty kind of is this for me. Um actually is that true? Well thing is if

Samuel and/or Matthew
45:22
In terms of the classics. I would say PS3 more than 360. Um that's probably fair actually. So when I was thinking about this, I thought of of the recent recent-ish consoles. PS3 is the one that I'm furthest away from being on top of.

Samuel
45:35
Well, that's interesting because I don't know, I like I played I played I I played quite a deep bench of games from that era. Like I played the Motorstorm games, Heavenly Sword, all that kind of stuff. The only thing I could really think of If you t if you take Demon's Souls aside, because we don't really play those games on this podcast, as we talked about many times, then I would say that Nino Kuni is the one big game. I never really Or like, I guess like maybe you say Gran Turismo, but again, it doesn't really matter which Gran Turismo you play. Yeah, so I think that the PS3 is probably closest. 360's not quite there. I didn't I haven't finished all the Gears of War games, for example. Um but otherwise I think every every game that would be in like a top twenty-five list for three sixty I I have finished. It's a I've played so many of them. Um that I never really got to the end of. Like you must have felt similarly about that generation, because all the gate all the games were about

Matthew
46:33
I still like seven and eight out of ten's that I'd still be interested to play that I haven't.

Samuel and/or Matthew
46:38
Yeah, but I could still say I've completed the three sixty without finishing fifty cent Blood on the Sand, you know what I mean? Like I think that's alright.

Matthew
46:44
But like I took well then I'm re like Wii U is the one where I genuinely feel like I've played every game of worth on it.

Samuel
46:52
Yeah. Yeah, I did also think um about the PSP a little bit, similarly, because again it was a console I had in my head in a lot of the time. Um but I would say that this is like a bit similar to Matthew's um situation with DS and 3DS like uh I never played through Jean d'Arc, for example, or some of the other Scranics games that they pumped out on that console. Scranics made loads of good games for the PSP, um, including Final Fantasy Tactics, a game I still not played. So Yeah, I don't know, it's it's tricky, but PS3 definitely closest. Um but Nino Cooney is sort of like uh ah it would have been nice to play that at the time. I don't know why I didn't. I didn't have anything better to do in twenty thirteen, but um

Samuel and/or Matthew
47:29
I'd be interested to know if the burglar who stole my PSP feels like he's truly completed PSP in his prison cell. Indeed, they banged him up for life. Um okay Matthew, read out the next one. Hello Giant Men. After your recommendation of the sexy brutal, I decided to give it a go.

Matthew
47:47
I am enjoying the game but simply can't stand the Electro Swing soundtrack, so I've turned it off and played my own music. I've also got over 3,000 hours in the binding of Isaac, but recently the sound came back on in the settings, after it'd been muted for probably the last five hundred hours or so while listening to podcasts. I was struck by how overwhelmingly unpleasant all the squelchy sounds of blood, shit, piss, etc. are, and promptly turned the sound off again. See also the mode in Soma where the monsters don't chase you, originally a mod but then patched into the game. So my question, what are some of your favourite games that you love? but where you've made a conscious choice to change them from the dev's intended manner of play so that you have a better of time. Cheers, so you have a better time. Cheers, stride chicken

Samuel
48:38
Yeah, so the most recent one that came to mind here Matthew for me was uh when I turned the music off and Lumines arise.

Matthew
48:45
What?

Samuel
48:45
Yeah, I just needed to focus on the point. Well I just needed to focus on getting the pu the puzzle done. Like it was just Sometimes the sound effects were too sort of like chintzy and sort of driving me a bit nuts. And I was just a bit like, I gotta turn this off. And I just I just mute the entire game and then I hear nothing.

Samuel and/or Matthew
49:02
And then just Luminous Horizon is a game where I'd like to be able to switch off the Luminous and just enjoy the soundtrack. That's a great take.

Samuel
49:09
That's kind of the main example that really sort of came to mind.

Matthew
49:13
The only one I could really think of this is using the rewind feature on Switch Online games, like playing the retro library and endlessly rewinding when I died on like any boss. Cause it basically nukes the challenge from all those harder, you know, NES, SNES, even Game Boy Advanced games. Uh which is not how you're meant to play those games or experience them. But That's a huge help. Um I would say generally, like I I honestly struggle to think of times where I've adjusted a game. Like I think I'm I'm like the easiest player in the world for a game developer. Like I I'm I do not go into options. I do not meddle with stuff. If anything, I used to roll my eyes. at the babies under like the RPS videos who'd be complaining about the settings I was using in games like oh you're using a controller instead of mouse a keyboard oh you haven't adjusted the FOV What the fuck does that mean? I've never done that in my life. That is that stuff like that I find intolerably nerdy. I trust that a d a developer has created the version of the game they want me to play out of the box. Maybe that's naive, ts and maybe there's better experiences waiting me, you know, if I decide to go against that, but I've not got the time to be tweaking. I do not want to tweak at the beginning of a gameplay experience. That is not fun to me. Yeah. I'm against this. I'm anti adjusting it. I think developers when people are like review bombing something 'cause it hasn't given them this option or that option. I'm like, there shouldn't even be an option screen, you know?

Samuel and/or Matthew
50:49
When you go into when you go into Matthew When you go into Matthew's office

Samuel
50:55
There's a chalkboard there, he's wearing a suit, and he just writes on the chalkboard, NBT. Never be tweaking. And like if you And he goes No coffee for tweakers, he shouts to a guy at the back, basically. You can't be messing with the menus under Matthew's watch.

Matthew
51:11
I feel the second you started giving people these options is the time they started complaining about how the game was presented to them in the base version. Like no one knew that you could change these things in still people until People started changing these things. They should've kept it pure. I wanna go back to the Garden of Eden when no one knows what the fuck FOV means.

Samuel and/or Matthew
51:35
You're alright, but what you've identified is that gatekeeper gatekeeper motherfuckers who sit on the same two or three reddits.

Matthew
51:41
But it's infected consoles as well. You think so? Yeah, because console games now behave a bit like PC games and they're beginning to get, you know, like, you have to pick the visual mode that works for you. You have to basically work out what how this game runs best on your TV. Like do not want it's why I'm a Nintendo fan at heart. Nintendo give you no control. They're not interested in these things. I will say, as a side note to this, I'm not talking about accessibility controls. Obviously. Oh, I like that caveat at the end.

Samuel and/or Matthew
52:13
I'm obviously not talking about that before anyone acts.

Samuel
52:22
You can have a game. My eyesight's fucked anyway. I can't see the detail of high fidelity 30 fps. So I'll take a bit of smoothness at 60 FPS. That's absolutely fine. Yeah, I don't know. I I sort of uh I don't I don't mind a bit of that, but it's one of those things where I almost wish that the game would make the choice for me. What the developers think is best in terms of the visuals and then I can change them if I want to. Like I don't I remember when I first played Spider-Man on PS5 and they were like, which of these modes do you want? And I was just like Uh, you should decide, Insomniac. Like, you make this game, which one do you think I should be playing? Should Spider-Man be moving super smoothly on my screen, or should I be able to see the bit on those windows when he's s running alongside them or whatever, like reflections and stuff in the distance. You decide, Ted Price. Like you make that decision for me.

Matthew
53:07
And because they won't decide. That's That's why I mean that's one of the many reasons why Digital Foundry is so successful. Just to have someone out there who goes, just do this, this is the thing. And I'm like, thank you. Thank you so much for just telling me. Yeah, you've done all three of them. This one is the best, and you're like, great, that's all I need.

Samuel
53:26
You are so right on safe states though, like that I hadn't really thought of that as an answer to this question, but it really is Like i uh like the game um a game I talked about a few times in this podcast, Iron Hander on PS1. Amazing shooter. But if I didn't have save states, I wouldn't fucking get anywhere in that game. Like it's so hard. And um, you know, w uh any sort of like valor I've I've gained from playing that game is completely stolen. Like I'm edge of tomorrowing my way through every single moment of that game basically because your ship is fucking giant on the screen. And there's still loads of shit going on around you. And I'm like, I'm gonna save state the fuck out of this.

Samuel and/or Matthew
54:00
I bet I've d I've got more than a thousand save states in my game of Einhandler. Save state every individual frame that that game can have It's so close to that it's almost unbelievable.

Samuel
54:10
Like it's almost like every encounter. Because every encounter is kinda like you have to almost memorize. what enemies gonna be where in order to survive. Like it's so hard to just respond to things on the fly. At least it is if you're me. And I'm there thinking, if I had to like If like Square Circa like 1998 kidnap my family and like we're gonna like murder them if you don't complete Einhand uh We're giving you a thousand hours to do it like consecutively, but you can't you can't save your progress. I think my family would be dead. I don't think there'd be any way to sort of like do anything about that.

Matthew
54:41
What if they were like, but you can exchange one family member and have safe states?

Samuel
54:46
Oh yeah, I've got at least like two or three collateral family members that are going in the bin. If it comes down to that, that's fine. I've got a surplus.

Samuel and/or Matthew
54:53
Wow, we thought that would be a tougher bargain, but obviously not.

Samuel
54:56
I've got some like yeah, I've got like an aunt or uncle I can bid off.

Samuel and/or Matthew
54:59
It's absolutely fine.

Matthew
55:00
I The problem with the save state things, I'm so used to doing it now that I even do it in games, which I know I don't need them in. Like The Creating safe states in Luigi's mansion on the GameCube. An incredibly easy game.

Samuel and/or Matthew
55:14
But like every time I'm going into a room, it's like, may as well, just in case. Save state for a game you could finish in probably one sitting at a push, you know?

Samuel
55:22
That's unbelievable really. I love the idea of that. Ultimate lazy man convenience that is. Save states. Victory has defeated you, Matthew, as Bane would say. Okay, next question then is from Judge Fear. Large lads, thanks to Black Friday sales, I now have a PSVR2 and Ghost Town. Has Math Samuel or Matthew played any VR games more recently? Do you have any recommendations? Or should I be asking Ian Higton on Eurogamer? Uh Ask Ian Higton is my primary answer to this, Matt. If you have more thoughts, but what's your response to this?

Matthew
55:54
Uh well I can say I mean you've got Ghost Town, which is the is the thing I would have recommended, which is made by um fireproof, the team behind the room. Uh and sort of a similar thing in the room where you interact with lots of objects and like puzzle boxes, but sort of embedded into more of a sort of first person spooky. I is I I it's a horror experience in that you're exploring haunted places, but I'd say it's more like Ghostbusters sort of sort of goofy horror than it is like PT, I'm you know I'm gonna traumatize you for life. Uh but it's just beautifully made, really tactile. I really like that. I mean to be honest, I haven't played a huge amount of my PSVR two um ever since I shot myself in the head in Pavlov. Oh yeah. Dark life-changing moment That I mean that's the closest I've come to sort of dystopian sci-fi you know, like David Cronenberg's existence or something where I was like, actually technology's ch technology's too powerful and I shouldn't have done that.

Samuel and/or Matthew
57:02
I bought Pavlov after Matthew told that story.

Samuel
57:04
I thought, oh I won this existential dread. This sounds great.

Matthew
57:09
Yeah, terrible. That's one of the worst things I've done as a human.

Samuel and/or Matthew
57:14
Like the idea of it is terrible. That's really interesting. That's the that you feel that way about it. I really 'cause I crept off to a stairwell.

Matthew
57:24
So it feels a bit too real that it's a bit more. Yeah.

Samuel
57:32
So good. So good. We should do a top ten most despair ridden moments that we've done we've had on this podcast. I'm sure we've got plenty by now. Um all right. So yeah, I mean I think what Matthew says there is you know, Ghost Town was the first one. Ghost Town Pavlov is why he said that. Ghost Town is the big standout when you look at VR games that came along last year. Obviously Luminares Arise if you have a PS VR two or um PC based VR.

Matthew
57:58
Yeah.

Samuel
57:59
Yeah, so those are like two things you can play and you know definitely I I've not played Luminez Arise, but I did play Tetris Effect, so yeah.

Matthew
58:05
Yeah, what what I like about Luminez and VR, which I which I did play, is that a lot of the The boards like as these actions are happening, it's like spilling out into the arena, which is something I don't think actually happens in the TV version. It's like bespoke to the VR version of it and you know like all the water is like sloshing out and fruits like rolling all over the place and it's it's pr it's pretty amazing to see. I mean it's

Samuel
58:33
like a trippy way to play it, but it's a funny day to get this question actually because uh Facebook I'm not calling them meta, Facebook just closed three of their VR studios. And I think it was fairly obvious that Mark Zuckerberg never cared about video games and he was trying to hawk some office VR thing that no one wanted and three years ago and I'm always a bit suspicious of new money in games when there are like inv tourist investors who come along at like a big m a moment when games are exploding in value. But you don't really think they care. And I would describe I would put Zuckerberg in that bucket for sure. Like he's not a video game guy. Sad because like Deadpool VR was one of the big games that came out last year. That was made by the um Sposure Man um studio um twisted pixel and they are they've been closed down now. And so that whole MetaQuest ecosystem feels like it's in quite a precarious state suddenly. Um which sucks because the hardware is really good. But it does also mean that like I'm loath to really encourage anyone to invest in it or jump into it because It's loads of money and like all that's happening is developers who were making stuff are just going away. Um, so I'm a bit like about the whole thing to be honest. That said Um Arkham Shadow is really good, the um VR game that came out a couple of years ago. Um that's a meta a MetaQuest game, but it's really um Amazingly done, like it makes the the most out of the visual capabilities of that MetaQuest III headset. Um Beat Saber, really obvious one, but again, really, really good. Super hot VR. Um again you'll see all these on like the lists of the best VR games, but there's a reason they're on there. It's a lot of the kind of core classics uh remain as such. I know people like Walkabout Mini Golf. Only played a little bit of that one, but um they've done loads of DLC for that because I think it's like a actually a pretty popular, successful game. So yeah, while it's not in like the best state, it is still an area where interesting games do happen. So um I guess like yeah a bit of a bit of caution cautionary recommendations if that's a thing. But yeah. Next question Matthew.

Matthew
01:00:33
Hello Matthew and Samuel. I've just listened to the John Denton episode and I wanted to give you feedback. I enjoyed listening to Chet and John's reassuringly finite playlist and was sad when it stopped. Over the years I'd heard you mention John's name, and I wondered if there would ever be a possibility that he or Chet would appear on the episode. A couple of weeks ago I opened up iTunes and saw John's name on the episode title, which was a pleasant surprise. I had no idea that Chet wasn't Chet's real name. I don't remember John ever saying Chet's real name on an episode of their podcast, but I guess it did i I guess if it did happen, they would have covered it up through the editing. Uh, your views on UK podcasts I think are similar to mine, to the point where I will actively prioritize trying to seek out UK podcasts to listen to so I can support them in a landscape that is filled with American ones. Thank you for having John on and I appreciate all of your efforts producing the podcast every week. That's from Andrew. Not really question there, but

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:01:34
Yeah, it was just sent to the it was just sent to the inbox.

Matthew
01:01:36
I don't think it was a mailbag. Listen, I love talking to John. That was great. Um you know, his his podcast, their podcast, uh had a huge impact on so many other UK podcasters, so that was a really cool thing to get into. I won't take this end bit of this as like we're anti-US podcast, by the way.

Samuel
01:01:56
That was the one that was the one thing I was gonna chuck in here, is I don't I don't actively seek out UK podcasts, really. It was more making the point, I think, that in video games, it was a more narrow landscape for UK podcasts than I maybe thought it was when we first came up with the podcast. Like I think we were worried that we'd move into a space that was oversaturated. But then what we realized was it's actually like there are not really loads and loads of them. There are IGN UK, TCGS and like a few others of note, but it wasn't really it really was US dominated. There's maybe like 20 to 30 big US ones and maybe like five to ten key UK ones. So yeah, I think um that was more the point I was making, really. It's definitely nothing against uh US. But yeah, John was a great guest. Um if you're interested, Chet Royvas is on Letterboxed and um followed me a few weeks ago and he is it is fun without having heard his voice for more than ten years it is fun to um to read his takes, which are sometimes like I don't say contrarian, but like really spicy either way. Um which in a way that I just find very fun, but I remember being like part of that podcast DNA. So I think he's just that Chetroivus on letterbox if you want to give him a follow, so uh yes. Um okay, next question. Playing Rise of the Golden Idol, I'm very taken with the idea of an ancient civilization creating a dance-based language with a li very limited vocabulary and choosing to focus that vocabulary on such versatile, essential day-to-day words as forbidden, evil, and full. If you had to create a language consisting of no more than ten words with which to communicate your video game takes through the ages. What words would you choose? Also, sorry, but to ensure backwards compatibility with existing style guides, the first three words have to be Phantom Bummig, as from TJ Cleaver. A reference to uh Matthew Castle favourite there, I'm sure um real heads know as they say, Matthew. Uh what have what have you got for this? Have you got it down to ten words? La Dee Dah. Oh, I had La Dee Da as well, Dean Dee Diddly D

Matthew
01:03:55
Nimbly Bimbly. Well I took Ladi Dar as three words, and D Dim D as three words, Nimbly B as two words. No, that's everything, you're done. And uh for some reason I'd already noted down Phantom Bumeg. That's three words, but I took it as two. I don't know why. Bum egg is definitely three words.

Samuel
01:04:12
Well I went for the the full ten, but I I sort of I thought because the little like Can we not say La Didar as one word? I mean I did hear. Um it's sort of like but I like I like your approach. It's it's elegant. Um I went with short, long, time waster, amazing, fine, average, bad, stimulating, depressing, la Didar. Those are my ten. So um I think you can pretty much communicate everything you need to know about games there. Time waster is gonna do so much heavy lifting there, I think. That one's gonna get wheeled out a lot.

Matthew
01:04:39
I might swap nimbly bimbly for good hang uh and bad, because then you can make bad hang.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:04:45
You don't need hang twice, you can save an extra word there. Okay then Matthew. Um next question. You wanna read this out? Hello men of a similar size to myself.

Matthew
01:04:56
I've heard you use the term bad hang quite a lot, very apt. So who would you say some questionable NPCs in games are? So An NPC you would want to kill, an NPC you wouldn't want to be stuck in a lift with, and an NPC you wanted to see more of. PS, this is the only correct use of semicolons. They've used semicolons in their message. We obviously debated semicolons in a previous episode. Um Das for Jackie Boy34. I'm not getting into the semicolon issue. You just have to feel your way through them. That's what I'm saying.

Samuel
01:05:30
Yeah, much like the scores, really. Um Much like the scores. Much like everything in your life, everything in Matthew Castle's life you have to just shoot from the hip and hope for the best.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:05:38
I just have a feel for I just know when I need to use a semicolon. No, you are right about that. That was a good counter to my.

Samuel
01:05:45
It was more I was more making the point that if you see someone use like four or five of them in 800 words, then maybe. an excessive number of them or like used incorrectly or used where there should be a comma. Um you're you're you're twisting my words there, Matthew, but Anyway, these NPC questions. NPC you would want to kill. Um goodbye, Chadley, from the Final Fantasy VII Remake games. You are going straight in the bin, my friend. Chadley sums up a lot of the problems for the FF7 remake project. He wasn't in the original game. He is bloat and he brings game bloat with him. So in the bin he must go. Thoughts, Matthew?

Matthew
01:06:24
That's that's understandable. I I picked for NPC to kill actually now I've seen it written it down, this just seems really callous of me. I picked that homeless guy in Valentine in Red Dead Redemption 2, keeps giving you sob stories and asking for money. Right. He's an incredibly bad hang. I think it eventually turns out that he's like lying as well, so I'm on slightly firmer ground for shooting him in the head there, but Just every time I'm leaving Valentine to have him being like, Oh, Mr. Mister, yeah, let's kill that guy. Is that too callous?

Samuel
01:06:56
No, I think that's fine. Um that's alright. I mean it's I assume it's something you can do in that game if you want to, and um the game will react accordingly. Is that a thing you can do? I don't really know.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:07:06
I mean if you shoot anyone in Valentine, the people of Valentine aren't into it. So. Yeah, okay, I gotcha. Um, okay, well uh NPC you wouldn't want to be stuck in a lift with.

Samuel
01:07:16
So, having d just played through Grand Theft August 4. A few characters from this are sort of like swing around my brain, but I want to save some of my takes on those characters till we get back to it. So I would say uh there's a guy who uh controls the tank in um Graw 2, um Tom Clancy game, who is absolutely like terminal to listen to. He just goes No say it cannot do when you try and send him to a location. And I don't want to be in a lift with that guy. He's trying to get the tank into the lift And he keeps saying no say cannot do because the lift will not fit in the the tank will not fit in the lift. Um I mentioned like in my my bad hang of last year was Yatsley from Avowed. who just talked about shagging her husband like in uh too much detail and you're like, just give it a rest, love. Like there's a bit of a bit sorry, bit of sexism thrown in there, like accidental sexism. Um but yeah, a bit of like um I mean please keep it down. I wouldn't want to be in a lift with Yatsley, so uh

Matthew
01:08:12
Yeah.

Samuel
01:08:12
Um how about you Matthew, what do you got for this one?

Matthew
01:08:15
I I I must admit, um I originally I tackled this question, I went like I was thinking more like unnamed NPCs for some reason, like proper passers by, which why for NPC I don't wanna be stuck in a lift with. anyone from Fable. I I just I do not want any of those towns people in a lift staring at me, waiting for me to do something, because that's their whole deal, is they just react to you. And once you've done anything, like you scratch your nose, once you've got their attention, they're like locked in and expecting a show. Yeah. And I think in a lift that would be Quite an intense environment.

Samuel
01:08:49
You're just like, oh, I'm gonna have to fart and juggle my way out of this one again. And you're just you're just livid about the whole thing.

Matthew
01:08:56
Yeah. I mean also I think a fable NPC, if they were in a lift, they'd just be wigging out about being in a lift, 'cause if they don't see such things in Albion, so

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:09:06
That's a whole that's a whole other deal. NPC you wanted to see more of then.

Samuel
01:09:10
Um so uh I feel like it'd be too uh much of a Kajima emoji answer to go with Black Cat from the Spider-Man games by Insomniac. So I'll go with my guy Rin from Final Fantasy X. Um just like uh Shopkeep who's from with the Albed faction. Um he's always there on your airship, but uh I like Rin. I think Rin's one of my favorite Final Fantasy X characters, and he gets a lot less screen time than the likes of Seymour or Wacker, despite clearly being a better hang. So uh he kinda came to mind Matthew. What have you got for this one?

Matthew
01:09:38
I picked uh my beloved Vernon Roach Roche, the character I name I can never pronounce from the Witcher series. Uh I mean most of the stuff you do with him is kind of unpleasant because everyone's just out for a revenge and it's quite a grim world, but uh I I d I think he is got a sort of bit of honour to him and I don't know, I just feel like we went through so much shit in The Witcher 2 that I'm I'm like forever bonded to that character. So when he turned up for a few missions in The Witcher 3 I was thrilled but um really like that the best thing the C D Project Red could do this year is uh announce that that Witcher Three

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:10:17
Expansion that's rumored is real and that it it actually about him and you just play as Vernon Roch just going around having a good old time. Yeah, he's really your guy, isn't he? He's one of your guys, your top five guys. He is, and he's so grim looking. Like he just uh there's nothing on paper says he's gonna be a good hang, but he just I think you like surrounding yourself with characters, even if they're not always good hangs.

Samuel
01:10:40
I mean I'm maybe I'm damning myself here, but um What in real life? Yeah, I think so.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:10:49
hanging out with pricklier people than some people are That's definitely true. You absolutely are, yeah. You've got a few I wouldn't say I've got like an appetite for it, but I can definitely like tolerate. I I don't know

Samuel
01:11:01
He got a few more friends like that than most people, I think. So yeah. Um interested. Again, damning myself there. Yeah, yeah, that's true. This DLC has to be the most discussed thing that doesn't exist yet because there are like people going like, oh yeah, this this developer's making it. And it's definitely coming out. And I've known about it for like eight years or whatever, people are saying that you're like, Yeah, okay, alright, well then let's get on with it.

Matthew
01:11:31
It's quite a big thing to sort of get behind and go, Yeah, this is happening as that kind of outlet, you know? Yeah.

Samuel
01:11:36
It's weird they didn't do it in time for the tenth anniversary though. That's a bit strange. Because that'd be the perfect time for it, wouldn't it? But In any case, um they do have a few years to go until Witcher 4 gets here, I guess.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:11:47
So fair enough, Matthew.

Matthew
01:11:48
Should have put the the the Witcher 3 expansion three in the fantasy critic draft. Now that's a swing. I'm interested to hear Sam's take on the Donkey Kong Bonanza soundtrack, given his music tastes. I'm only early in the game, but I can't think of a Nintendo soundtrack this electronic. I'm feeling it. The tutorial sublayer, the tutorial slash sublayer 10 level was almost new order like. That's from Daddy Magic.

Samuel
01:12:15
I'm gonna disappoint you, Daddy Magic. I d I do like music in that vein, yes, but honestly none of the soundtrack in Bonanza stuck in my head beyond the cursed Bonanza transformation music, which obviously drills its way into her head. I didn't find it particularly notable. There's nothing Gusty Gardens galaxy level in there as far as I'm concerned, Matthew, but I can already hear you groaning in the background. So um what are you think. That was actually the chair groaning under my ass. I didn't say anything. That was my I thought it was disagreement and it was just a creak. What do you think, Matthew? Eh Oh dear. That's so good. Alright, in which case we'll just move on and pretend that never happened.

Matthew
01:12:54
I know what he's talking about. There's like a In in the foot in like the mining tutorial area, there's they're all listening to like beatboxes which are playing this like sort of like throbbing dunno na. I can see where the new order comparison's coming from.

Samuel
01:13:09
Yeah, plus there is that bit uh where um uh Donkey Kong just does like the entirety of Blue Monday um for like nine minutes. That's like a really good um bit of that game, Matthew, that I remember well. That's the end credits. Um apologies if this is a repeat question. I love the pod, but I'm an infrequent visitor here. I assume to the Discord and I don't blame you honestly. I'd be really interested in the lad's take on how objectively bad games make it to production. The developers must know at some point you have to soldier on polishing an obvious turd. It must be soul destroying for everyone concerned. The same must go for terrible movies. I believe it's probably planned completion bias. There is a great episode about this on Tim Harford's Cautionary Tales podcast. Anyway, I think it's fascinating. We'd love to hear a segment about it on the pod. Max Scarletto 8008. An interesting question, Matthew. Do you have a take on this?

Matthew
01:13:56
I I had some notes. I remember reading before Christmas towards the end of last year, there was a Camille interview on VGC. where he talked about Japan's culture of prototyping and exploring ideas until they were right versus the pressure to get something made by a deadline set by a Western publisher. And this is just Camille's take. But You would think an obvious thing that that novels a lot of people is time pressure and money running out and having to deliver and just not having the time to to explore a an idea properly. I mean that certainly explains how, you know, one specific cameo game scale bound, how that kind of went wrong. He sort of said the you know, Microsoft were just pushing to make it too fast and That wasn't how they worked. I I'm always a little bit nervous about talking about how things happen in game development, because I'm not a game developer obviously. If you are curious about it as an outsider as I am, I I do think one of the best things you can do to get an idea of how games do and don't work. is watch that uh Psych Odyssey documentary about Double Fine making Psychonauts 2. Because what's interesting that is you know the end game and you know that it's a good game. but you can see how bad an eventually great game can be. A masterpiece isn't a masterpiece from day one and you have to have a lot of faith and you know there are I'd say from a large portion of that documentary, you think. Well, I know this game's good, but this game looks fucked. And is bad, and I don't know how they're motivating themselves. And I would imagine that is true of most games, that there is d you know, just a lot of faith in an idea and getting individual parts right and hopefully having the time and money and runway to actually see an idea through. So you know, I don't know that that point comes where you're like, Oh, this thing's just fucked forever. I don't know if you would ever get to that point, you know, unless there was a firm deadline on it and you're like, well that just can't be d fixed in five months or whatever. That's kind of my take.

Samuel
01:16:08
Yeah I have a few thoughts on this. I think um I think uh having done a little bit of like behind the scenes like consulting and and that kind of thing, I think that you do You do get this light you do or don't get this lightning bulb lightning bulb light bulb moment fuck me I need to have dinner you do get this light bulb moment of A game when it finds the fun. And when it finds the fun, I think it feels like they they have something. And if the game feels like it's sort of moving along in development and never finds the fun, then it turns into a little bit of a deathmatch. I think you also do get It depends on the company's like self uh like a self awareness as well. I do think that the plan completion bias thing is is probably true. I think there is a certain amount of tunnel vision that comes with game development where, you know, you're sort of so invested in it because you've put all these years into it, so therefore it must be good. Kind of like feeling for it where Even if the game if the game turns out bad, then maybe it doesn't really occur to you until launch comes along and suddenly it's like not what you thought it was going to be and That can definitely happen as well. Um, good intentions and all that. But I think that uh this is why like mock reviews and stuff and that sort of thing it can be just so valuable because you can just have that moment of course correction or you can at least have the mo the moment of self-reflection of like To get this to be good, we need to move it, or at least, you know, people can have that information and not do anything with it, which might also happen. The game might still come out and be bad. So Yeah, really all kinds of reasons. I mean I just watched the a bunch of like Mark Darrell's amazing three-hour plus video uh about the the truth behind Anthem, which just closed its servers this week. But sort of like beloved anthem, the hero of the sub um m eighty metacritic draft that we did, Matthew. Um it was a case study in exactly how uh you know, good intentions and all that and how things can go wrong and This was I uh kind of extraordinary how badly this went wrong. This was doomed, seemingly, from what the video says, by a pitch that Casey Hudson made to EA's executives that they would make a bioware game that would make as much money as FIFA. Basically, everything that Bioware does, but on a scale and like multiplayer that like unlocks some next level of revenue because it sounded like bioware games did well, but not as well as maybe EA wanted them to or that, you know, obviously if you're if your your revenues next to FIFA are going to be tiny, but yes, they were always going to be because they bought Bioware, what did they expect, etc. But it then sounded like that pitch people were so into it, it was so successful in in terms of getting the executives excited that it poisoned all aspects of the game. Um because no one had any idea what form Hudson's pitch would actually take in terms of the game that you play. and it took a long time for them to figure out what that was, like years and years in fact. And then by the time they settled on what it was, it kinda like killed or claimed a bunch of projects in its wake, including the original version of Dragon R uh Dragon Age 4. um which I think was codenamed Joplin, something like that. And because they suggested the idea of bringing forward that Dragon Age game to where Anthem's release date was in around 2019 time. And um they said no, like it has to be Anthem. An Anthem has to be the next game 'cause that was the game that they are excited about. And again, they're all sold on this pitch. Um and it just uh obviously Anthem ended the way it did. It was Uh it just meant that like despite having fine fundamentals, there was no content in Anthony. That was the problem with it. Like they took so long to figure out what the actual game part was that it was almost too late to even make the game. It sucks because Bioware was an all-timer studio, but it was it it all started from that pitch onwards. It was it just seemed like a runaway train and they didn't know what it was and by the time they did it was too late. And so Really I think that's a it was a great um lesson in like um what can go wrong because one thing that Dara said in that that really stuck with me For a bioware project, it was unusually secretive. Like every presentation was like had a password on it, every you know, every PowerPoint and that kind of thing. And like apparently Hudson would drop little snippets of what the game was in in like meetings and stuff to tantalize because he knew that was part of the power of selling people to allocate resources to it versus other bioware games and that kind of thing. And the exact quote that he used was secrecy can be an enabler for poor communication. And then it sounded like poor communication doomed that game because They were just the bits of it weren't joined up. It's just a great like case study of this. So a similar to your Camille point, Matthew, I think that yeah, like it it really can just be best of intentions and then all kinds of things can go wrong. Things don't pan out the way you want them to want them to. Nothing malicious along the way, but it just it ends in tears and then no one decides to like Fix it, which is what happened without them.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:21:07
So yeah.

Samuel
01:21:08
Interesting, but um next question then, Matthew. Penultimate question. Many cafes in Japan do themed food around TV shows, games, anime, or really anything Often these are time-limited offerings. They often these often reference the show or characters in some way. For example, had a Ryu drink at the Capcom Bar I had a big blue fireball ice cube in the middle. We then had a Phoenix Wright chicken uh wing gavel to bang on onion rings. Sorry. I just understand what he was saying there in that in what the way that was written down. If you were to set up a short-term backpage pod cafe in Shibuya, what would be the Big Sammy and the Matthew Castle offerings of food, and what would your signature drinks be? Some Reg McFly Matthew.

Matthew
01:21:48
Well, I was really tired when I tried to come up with an answer for this on a train at half seven this morning. Which explains how I came to uh in honor of uh Matthew Castle Productions Uh close ties with Randy Newman. Uh oh god. This is one of these ones when I'm reading it now. I'm like, I just don't even want to say that. Uh This is so shit. It's a plate it's a plate with my face on it, but my face made out of peas. And the dish is called You've Got a Friend in Peas.

Samuel
01:22:29
Do you know what? I've only g written down like food items. I've not even written down a novel aspect to this. I think I just saw this and groaned and was like, uh. Um I So I I like you've got a friend in peas as an a as an as an effort.

Matthew
01:22:47
Yeah.

Samuel
01:22:48
I don't really have a I don't feel like I have distinctive enough sort of persona. Like I think Your face is quite notable.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:22:54
Like you know you notice you you see it, you're like, Yeah, that's Matthew Castle with me. What about your face made out of opulent salmon? Or Bulldog noodles, you know, that could be also be the Bulldack noodles for hair. That could also be the offense. Salmon for salmon for the The flesh.

Samuel
01:23:10
Yeah, again, I don't really sort of like the sort of whole big Sammy thing. I don't really know you can have like uh like this the small Sammy the medium Sammy and the big Sammy and it's just like And those are like meat platters and you could have some kind of like horrific visage of my face in the meat platter, I guess. That might be the kind of thing that they're going for here. I mean when I went to the Square Enix Cafe. I think I shared the very, very depressing Dragon Quest pizza that they had there. Like genuinely the worst pizza I've ever eaten. That includes all of the refrigerated and frozen pizzas I've had over the years. Like I just think that the staff at that cafe were out of their depth with that pizza. It was really just like more like hot floppy bread, as Alan Partridge would say. Um it just had like it had little like um It was like four different types of pizza on one pizza, but it all looked incredibly unappetizing and one was one part was blue like the little blue lads from Dragon Quest. Um oh it was so bad. But they um they redeemed themselves though with the um they had like a a Sunday that had like a chocolate buster sword in it. That was really good. So again, I but again I don't really know what that sort of like item would be that really sums up the sort of podcast. Like a chocolate version of again like a chocolate Matthew Castle that goes in Again, that's quite cursed a quite cursed item really. Um yeah, I don't know.

Matthew
01:24:31
I didn't have a good answer to see them Matthew, so I think I'm just gonna have to tap out and say so sorry mate, I mean Have you got a drink? Have you got a comedy drink?

Samuel
01:24:39
You got three types of Sami related meals. That's all I've got for you, alright? And some stories about Japan.

Matthew
01:24:44
I I uh I think just ordering the big Sammy is enough. I think so. That'll probably give you a heart attack.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:24:49
I wouldn't say that's any any better or worse than you've got a friend and teas, which is We move on to the final question then, Matthew. Hey, well my my drink, if you're interested. Is a is a cocktail. It's the Mat Hito. Oh, I really thought you were gonna say you've got a friend in Pete.

Samuel
01:25:05
And it was gonna be like uh some kind of other drink. That might have been good, but um that's good.

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:25:10
Yeah, Mat Heater, I like quite like that. That's alright. Um look at Matt it mat. Yeah, Matt He I I do like Ma Mojito. Yeah, I like a mojito as well. I like a pina colada, but I can really think of a Samuel Roberts related way you could tie that in. They're quite different uh Whoa Whoopa. We've got to stop doing Let's come up with comedy for the first time. That's a problem.

Samuel
01:25:27
It's like we get a lot of questions like this, and I'll be honest with you, I just think they're like They're like they're tough because I think people want a comedy answer. Like someone put in on like I think they put it on like the twenty-third of December, they said Uh what would you put at the top of your Christmas tree? And it's like we're gonna do the next mailbag in January. It'll be completely pointless to even answer this. And I don't have a comedy answer for you. Like Sometimes it's just I think the the better mailbag questions have a slight comedic element, like the NPC one, but still allow us to not like

Matthew
01:25:56
Not have to generate comedy bits on the fly.

Samuel
01:26:01
I appreciate the question, Reg, but I I got the big savvy for you. That's all you got.

Matthew
01:26:05
When I answered this question, I was literally looking out of a train window at like Chippenham Thinking, what can I do? What can I possibly do?

Samuel
01:26:12
Chippenham did not inspire the magic in you, Matthew, the sight of Chippenham. Um, a shocker. Okay, um I think I know what I'm gonna do for the drink, Matthew. I've come up with it. Okay, so you know the um Samuel Adams spear We're gonna have like the big Sammy Adams beer. That's what we're gonna have. That'll be the time. Done. Oh got out of that one. Thank uh survive just about it.

Matthew
01:26:38
I hope you enjoyed that. Listen to that.

Samuel
01:26:41
Really real insight into the creative process there. Last question then Matthew, did I read this out?

Samuel and/or Matthew
01:26:45
I love that that follows that incredibly insightful look at what Mark Darrow said about Anthem. I might cut this depending on how I'm feeling when I edit it. No no you gotta keep it.

Samuel
01:26:57
The scars the s uh the scars of making the podcast, it's nice to hide them sometimes and pretend we're always good, you know? It's just good to live in that reality sometimes. Do I read this out what this final one out with you?

Matthew
01:27:09
I just finished re-listening to the excellent top fifteen Nintendo games Triple Bill. Incidentally, these were originally the first ever episodes I listened to. That's a miracle that you continued, but thank you. Um Which I'm certain that every single listener adored. When are we to expect the total of nine episodes on PC, PlayStation and Xbox Top 50s? I eagerly await them, as do we all. By the way, I'm the guy that accidentally gave you the idea for the sub-80 draft, so when should I expect my royalties? Hope you have had a lovely weekend. That's from Joe S.

Samuel
01:27:43
Yeah, so the royalties, um so you get seventy-nine P, um, and we we can divide that into like eight checks for you if you want, um, of a few pennies each. Um so just let us know where that's payable too and We'll make that happen. I could probably claim that's gift aid, um, on my tax returns, that'd be good. Um yeah, so uh I think I would like to do these, but they w it was quite a big lift doing those three episodes. I mean I wouldn't do three, I'd do two next time, because uh however you might feel about the idea of doing three episodes on one subject that that was indulgent and not everyone liked it, some people really liked it. Um, I think that the first episode where we talked about the idea of list making as an activity, that's actually like one of our better editorial sort of based episodes and though that's like you know, that's like meat and potatoes backpage pod content. I think that by the time you get to the third end of the third one you're just quite tired because it's all been going on for quite a long time. But I don't know, what if we did It's like avatar. Yeah, but without a sexy varangue to really give it a bit of spice. Um it's just two men talking. Um yeah, so I would like to do PlayStation, I'd like to do that in the n at some point, but it's not on my radar for this year, and I don't feel a great pull to do it. Maybe it's just because The draft episodes are such a good way to talk about similar types of games, Matthew. What do you think?

Matthew
01:29:03
Oh like the Nintendo one was definitely helped by the fact that OM ended with two top 100 lists which like helped focus it was almost like a uh a starting point of like well the last time I did this exercise we came up with this And so as a launching point it was helpful where obviously I've not done anything like this for for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. But yeah, I mean I've been it's

Samuel
01:29:33
Yeah, and I think that there's you know, if you can look at what we're doing with the drafts now where we bring in Ash and Dave or extra people, like I think that revisiting consoles we've done, or combining consoles, mix and matching them, or just adding more perspectives so you get different types of games discussed. That's maybe a bit more in the realms of how I'm thinking about this stuff, you know, as opposed to hearing you know me pick like Halo 3 and in my top five Xbox games which is quite predictable um finding finding different ways to surface these things we talked about before is probably the way to go so Yeah, that's uh it might happen at some point, but um I don't feel a great pool to do it at the moment. So uh yeah. Okay. Well that's the end of the podcast, Matthew. So That was a pretty nutritious mailbag, really. I thought we'd fire through that in about 45 minutes, but somehow it took almost two hours as these things always do. Where can people get you on social media?

Matthew
01:30:25
Uh I am at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd and whatnot.

01:30:30
