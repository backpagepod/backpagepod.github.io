Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how's your weekend going?
Been looking at some wall damp in my house.
Nice.
Yeah, which obviously blows. Then I went to pub around the corner where I live, where they've just redone it. I thought it was a scary student place, so I haven't been in there.
I went in there because some friends pointed out that they had some consoles hooked up. She could go in there and play GoldenEye, or weirdly, on our table, the SNES version of Super Mario RPG.
Oh, that is weird. Was it presumably a SNES mini, right?
I think it was a SNES mini, but I couldn't work out how you reset it or got it back to the main menu.
Yeah. Oh, that's right, because what happened is one of my favorite burger joints, but one you consider too wildly experimental for your taste, Magu Burger. When they used to be based in whatever that sort of like DLC bit of bath is near where the other...
I don't actually know where anything is in the bath.
Is that Moreland Road?
Moreland Road, yeah. Again, this is just someone who's just lived in the center of bath for too long, really. Perfectly nice place.
But yeah, Magu, there, they used to have a SNES, the SNES Mini there where you waited as well. And so you'd inevitably get some very annoying kids who were playing like Mario Kart and thinking, why is this so shit compared to the Mario Kart I've got at home?
The funny thing about this Super Mario RPG is I hit the save file symbol and every single save file had been used, but it was all the first save point in the game. It was basically like five save files all in Mario's house.
Oh, I find that so cursed. It's like the idea of going to NQ64 and thinking I'm gonna start my playthrough of like the.hack series or something, or ZSRK, you know what I mean? Like, don't do it.
They also have, and this is something which is completely new to me. I mean, you may have seen this because you frequent bars more often than I do.
Let me down then.
Pint glasses that filled from the bottom.
How do you mean?
Well, when you pour a pint, it doesn't go in from the top. There's a valve in the bottom of the glass. They put it on a thing and it also fills the pint.
Wow, now that I don't know about, because I've just been, I'm a big Pepsi, sort of like max person these days. I don't drink that much.
Those glasses must cost a fortune because they've got a very elaborate seal at the bottom and there's signs all over the bars going, don't put your finger through that seal because your pint will fall out the bottom. It was absolutely like Cyberpunk 2077 shit. I was like, I couldn't believe it.
I was like, what the fuck just happened? Because you just put the glasses down, pressed a button and then it started filling up. You didn't have to do anything.
Yeah, the funny thing is that place in general is kind of going for a slightly neon lighty, kind of like Cyberpunk aesthetic, lightly I would say. It looks very similar to how the pub used to look, I would say.
Yeah, except darker.
Yeah, it is. And then now they have the neon lights to basically make it seem a bit more atmospheric, I guess. So I was just sat at a table and I was being lit up in pink and sort of blue light and I was thinking, wow, I've always wanted to be lit up like I'm in Blade Runner, but the sign on the wall just said milkshake or something.
And I was like, this is somehow not the most Cyberpunk thing that's ever happened.
Yeah.
So I guess you didn't get to see how fucked the N64 controllers were with that golden eye, because that's the thing I'm most curious about when I see an N64 setup, is how fucked are the analog sticks basically? Like that's always the litmus test, isn't it? But I'm guessing that table was taken when you got there.
Yeah, yeah, we didn't get to try it out. Yeah, there is something very un-Cyberpunk about being able to see Mario RPG in your eye line. Just that little squat Mario is not very futuristic.
No, indeed. And so, yeah, I kind of I do quite like it, though. The burgers are obviously excellent.
So, yes, that's our review of Nowhere in Bath. Yeah, available now. So, I've been watching Scott Pilgrim, actually, Matthew.
Scott Pilgrim takes off the anime. And I do really like it. I do wonder if I like it slightly less than other people because I always forget that with Scott Pilgrim, the thing I like the most is the premise, obviously, if this guy has to basically beat all the evil exes of his new partner, Ramona Flowers.
And it's a bit sort of like Naughty's Core, the story. And this anime sort of like flips out a little bit. As Jay Bailey, a friend of the show, put it very nicely.
It's basically rebuild of Evangelion, but for Scott Pilgrim, that's exactly what it is. It's not quite the same thing.
Has it got meat robots in it?
Oh, for fuck's sake, the meat thing again. I just forgot. I say Evangelion, you just picture a hot dog, basically.
No meat robots in this one. It is good, but I always forget that like, when it gets mega schmaltzy towards the end, and I forget that that's the part of Scott Pilgrim I sort of bounce off of. I quite like the sort of, I don't know, slightly acid-tongued characters and this kind of like idiotic center of it in the video game references, but then it becomes very, very schmaltzy and I kind of, I burn out a little bit on it.
Is that sort of something that you pass you by, Scott Pilgrim, Matthew?
Yeah, I quite like the film, but I think that's because when I saw it, that was one year I was at Comic-Con, and we saw the Scott Pilgrim panel, and they gave everyone badges at the start, and then they were like, if you've got this particular badge, you can come with us now and come and watch the premiere, and then we all walked through the streets and then watched the film with the cast and everything. And so it was really exciting. So I don't know if what I actually liked was how exciting that moment was.
Scott Pilgrim himself, I don't really like the character, in the film anyway, that's my only interaction with it. He's surrounded by always quite interesting people, and he himself, I'm like, eh, don't really care for this. And the music side of it, that's not really a world I care that much about.
I like the video game stuff, but I do not give a shit about the local music scene of Toronto.
Okay, good. That's sort of slammed their sort of indie music circuit.
No, I'm just not cool enough to like that kind of stuff. I was listening actually to, is it Brian Leo Malley?
Yeah.
On Simon's podcast, and it always bugs me when people are really into games, but also have stepped into the cool world of music. It's like you're both dweeb and cool, and as someone who is unable to make that transition, I just kind of resent it.
I do like it when your sort of like angle on something is like, I have been left out of this, and therefore fuck this thing.
Oh, that's like everything to me. Yeah, if I'm not interested in it, it's bad. That's how I basically get through life and make life palatable.
I just assume that I'm not missing out on anything good.
You're probably right. I've got nothing to disprove that, Matthew. I think that it's, the Scott Pilgrim character is, him being sort of hated is not that uncommon.
I think it's increasingly common as well, because, you know, he is a white guy, 23, dating like a high schooler, who he treats like shit, and then, and sort of like, I don't know, treats, I guess the whole premise kind of treats the partner, Ramona, as a prize to be won, which is again, quite a noughties core sort of idea. And again, this anime sort of like subverts that a bit. And none of that is, you know, was Brian Leo Malley's Circa 2006's problem, you know, to think about any of that.
So I definitely don't lay that at his door. But I think as time has gone on, people are just like, oh, this guy was kind of an asshole, but his roommate is super cool. You know, this, the Aubrey Plaza character, Julie in the coffee shop, super cool.
And his sister's cool. So yeah, I agree. It's about this sort of like supporting players.
And the show is sort of a bit more about them, I would say, than the Scott himself. So yeah, but that's enough about that, because that's not why we're here. Although it's kind of relevant to this episode, Matthew.
So we're doing another draft. It's been more than two months. Our last few drafts have been very sort of like, you know, sort of, we've been taking on a whole console at a time.
We've been trying to give those consoles their due. Really good sort of like first half, where we go to the history of the console, and then the hilarity ensues when me and Matthew fight to pick the best games for each console. Those all go really well.
Wanted a lighter draft to see out the year. This one was suggested by a listener, Koig in our Discord. Licensed Games Draft, Matthew.
So sort of like a, you know, not sort of a sub-genre, but it's an umbrella of games, right? It's a whole sort of like, I don't know, it's a whole area of games that is sort of its own weird thing with its own twisted history. So kind of an interesting one to get into, but it should result in a slightly lighter draft.
How are you feeling about this episode?
At first, I thought, oh, this is quite a small pool, but then as you think about it, you're like, so many things are licensed games, technically. It's actually quite rich. There are a few quite gnarly categories in there, but...
Yeah, I'm interested to see what you've come up with for it.
Yeah, I think these are some of my best categories, you know, sort of like Brad Pitt at the end of Inglourious Basterds. I think this might be my masterpiece, kind of like vibes, because I thought a lot more about, I mean, when we've done consoles, we pick genres, right? And that's not exactly what we've done here.
I think there's like one genre in there, but the rest are more sort of like, the criteria is a little bit more colorful, I would say. So excited to get into that. But Matthew, as ever, we have a preamble, probably won't be as beefy as our usual console sort of preambles, because I don't think there's as much to dig into here.
But the licensed game has a long and sort of strange history. Obviously, you know, you think about the sort of like notorious failure of ET and those carts being buried in the desert or whatever. Like the idea of the licensed game being bad goes back so, so far.
It's almost as old as gaming itself. The idea that licensed games are, you know, rushed. People pick up the license, churn out something to tie into a movie or a TV show, whatever it might be, rush it onto the market.
It's a pile of old ass. But because the license is so popular, it makes people buy the game anyway. And that was such, it was a staple of games for literally decades.
And you know, maybe it's profile has changed in the meantime. But Matthew, do you remember the first licensed game you played or owned?
I think the first licensed game that I played was Chippendale Rescue Rangers on the NES, which I think it may have been the first time I ever played a NES. It's like one of my earliest video game memories. And I remember them running around on telephone wire poles while these like robot dogs snapped underneath.
It was a video game. So it was automatically like the most amazing thing I'd ever seen as a whatever, five or six year old. You know, I imagine that's true for most people that they're probably the first thing they encountered in games was a high chance of being a licensed game.
Was it for you or?
No, the first game I ever played, I think was, or maybe I just watched it, was Super Mario Bros. on the NES. I remember vividly, like I must have been four or five at a friend's house watching that.
And I don't know if I got to play it or not, but I just have a memory of Fireball Mario sort of jumping through one of the first worlds in the game. Probably the first level. So that is, I think, the first game I ever played.
And if not that, I think it was Sonic the Hedgehog when my aunt and uncle got a Mega Drive in 1992 or something. So I was quite young, but the kind of like platforming mascots were my first touch point with games. Weirdly, I had to think hard about this.
The first licensed game I think I ever played was X-Wing on PC. So yeah, so I got, when my dad bought a CD-ROM drive for our PC in the early 90s, or maybe it was the mid 90s. This was like a game I got for Christmas.
It was before I'd even watched Star Wars. So it must have been 95, 96 times, something like that. Possibly even slightly earlier.
And so they bought me this game and I just looked, I remember looking at the cover. This is absolutely beautiful sort of like render of X-Wings flying towards a TIE fighter and there's an explosion and on the box art, it's a really beautiful thing. But that's actually quite an odd entry point to licensed games.
Yours is a much more typical I would say. I think that platformers, they're just sort of, all kids ended up with some licensed platformers in the 90s, right? Or ended up playing them.
And I think Chip and Dale, I know that those NES ones, are they Capcom games those ones, Matthew? I think they are, right?
Yeah, it was a Capcom one.
Yeah, so they had like, I think you can even get those still in like the Disney afternoon collection. That's somehow that's been on earth. You can still play that.
But I think all kids ended up having one of those. So the idea that my first one was a spaceship simulation game is actually quite strange. I was really just too young for it.
But I do remember after that playing the Aladdin and Lion King games as well. Those were like a huge deal in the mid 90s. And you talked about this before Matthew, but licensed games are kind of the blockbusters of their day, right?
Is that how you remember them?
Yeah, definitely. And it's kind of interesting this idea of like, licensed game equals bad because actually, certainly my Mega Drive experience was a lot of quite good Disney tie-in games made by Sega themselves. So they were like technically excellent, very solid platformers, really colorful licenses, very high production values.
Maybe I was like lucky that I don't think I was straying into the weird shit around the edges, which probably, you know, there probably was a big drop off. I know it was a platforming game basically based on every cartoon license. So, you know, if you had Aladdin and Quack Shot and Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck at one end of the scale, there were also like Ren and Stimpy platformers, which just look like absolute abominations.
So, there was a lot of that stuff. I say that one particular, because one of my earlier gaming magazine memories was buying a Mega Drive, like tips magazine, not really knowing it was a tips magazine. Like I don't think I really knew what games magazines were at that point.
And it used to just print out the entire game, you know, as the walkthrough for the game was just a printout of the whole level of a 2D platforming level. This issue had a Ren and Stimpy game in it. So, there were just these pages and pages of just platform formations with enemies.
Quite an abstract way to, you know, like I've seen all of Ren and Stimpy the game. I've like read, read and Stimpy the game. Like, imagine Ren and Stimpy the game as the Bay of Tapestry.
That's what these things look like.
Wow, what an honor that must have been to witness something like that. Amazing. It's funny because as someone who was playing PC, primarily in the 90s, I was sort of like on the outside looking in with licensed games.
And so, this friend across the street, so whenever he got a licensed game that was like big and shiny, I was extremely jealous. I remember him getting Rugrats Search for Reptar. That was in the late 90s.
That was when that Rugrats film came out. And it was quite a nice looking game for the time. It actually captured the art style of the show fairly well for rudimentary PS1 graphics because they are all fucking warped babies.
So, it actually makes sense, the juddering sort of like textures of PS1 graphics. So, yeah.
That should be the original working title of Rugrats is Warped Babies.
So, and it had like the voice actors in it. I remember just being incredibly jealous of that, but also because he'd just get demo'd there. So, it was just a snapshot into this other world of like, oh, what's this like, sorry, Disney magical racing tour and games like this that seemed quite fun in demo form.
And I was like, man, missing out on this on PC with all my good Star Wars games, this is tough. So, but in retrospect, I don't really think I missed out. And part of that is because many of them were bad.
And in the nineties, I think it was very much in the vernacular of, you know, sort of like, it was something that magazines talked about a lot was the idea that licensed games were rubbish and you should be wary of them and you should read reviews before you pick them out. And so I was aware of licensed games being rubbish, really, you know, quite young, probably about like nine or 10, really. So do you remember that as well, Matthew, that kind of like the atmosphere, a bit of that?
I remember it more clearly from the N64 PS1 generation. I think you could make a pretty solid 2D platform out of these games. And actually developers of notes like Capcom, like Sega, actually meant that there were some decent license tie-ins in that earlier generation.
But the shift to 3D and whether it's the jump in budgets or just that weird period that we've talked about a lot on here of just navigating that shift from making 2D games to 3D games, it knobbled a lot of people, licensed games or no, but licensed games were particularly rough. And I didn't play as many of them, but I read about a lot of them in Games Master. I have a really clear memory of going on a summer holiday with my family to a camping park, we used to have this trailer tent.
I had this little kind of compartment in the trailer tent, like underneath it that I used to live in. Like Harry Potter under the stairs. And I remember sitting in there reading the E3 issue of Games Master for that year, eating a fuse bar, which I'd only recently discovered.
And specifically laughing my ass off at a preview of the PS1 game of Dragon Heart. And they were just absolutely ragging on how much the sprites didn't... It was like one of those digitized Mortal Kombat style sprites of how much this sprite didn't look like Dennis Quaid.
That's kind of very typical of the time. Like the real shoeings people remember. And the reason like everything seems to get like eight, nines and tens now is because we don't have this tier of like absolute like two, threes and fours, which people took great pleasure.
I mean, God, N64 used to absolutely like savage, bad South Park tie-ins and things like that.
Yeah, it's funny though, because when I look back, there's actually a relatively healthy bank of decent 90s tie-in games, even on those platforms. Like obviously, things like Goldeneye are self-evident, but the likes of the Disney platformers that were on PS1 were pretty decent. Most of them were.
Okay, I don't really know that scene as well.
Yeah, most of them are sort of side scrolling games anyway, but people seem to quite like the Hercules one, for example, or the Alien Trilogy on PS1. I had a friend who was obsessed with Jackie Chan's Stunt Master, and he was like, this game secretly rules. There was the two Spider-Man games that were on PS1 as well.
Those are pretty decent, sort of like a precursor to what Treyarch would later make and then what Insomniac would later make. Obviously, Die Hard Trilogy as well. So there was actually a reasonably decent bank of these games.
It just happened to be that there's such a high volume of them that their reputation in general was rubbish because there was just so little gold amongst them. But when the gold appeared, it did mean that those games were able to become incredibly prominent. Every kid I knew had Die Hard Trilogy.
I don't know if these kids had even seen the movies or maybe they'd just seen like 20 minutes of it on ITV1, but it was a big badge of honor for a 12-year-old to have Die Hard Trilogy in their collection of PS1 games. That was definitely a thing. So yeah, it's a weird one.
I think quality has always existed amongst that. But I agree with you that that was the era of those games being roasted and you becoming very wary of that. I think that was one of the factors that would eventually lead to publishers stop doing it because people would see through it.
They wouldn't just buy a game automatically because it had a license. People just became wise to that in the 90s, I would say. How often did you buy shit games anyway because the license got you excited, Matthew?
The worst case of this, and I've definitely mentioned this before, was when I bought Revenge of the Sith PS2 game because I got pulled into Sithmania in the run-up to that.
Was that a thing? Sithmania? I don't remember that term specifically.
I don't know how it came to be given what happened with Phantom Menace and Clone Wars, but everyone would go nuts for those things. That's when the modern hype machine was powering up and it was just everywhere. If you read Empire magazine, they'd have a 40-paged feature about Revenge of the Sith and it tricked you into thinking that you were really invested in these things.
Why did I buy it? I was at university. I had no money.
I bought a full price Revenge of the Sith tie-in before I'd seen the film. But back then, that happened with Star Wars and The Matrix. There was just so much of it about that you were like, I kind of have to get in on every bit of this.
But that one doesn't make sense. I'm not even a Star Wars guy. I just have no idea what happened.
It was just a moment of madness, Your Honor.
I forgive you. But it's funny because I had the same thing too, where I was wise to these shit ties-ins and yet I had my weak points. I was desperate for a good Matrix game.
I was desperate for a good Harry Potter game at the time. I really wanted to see that. So I did end up buying things I knew were dubious.
As mentioned, one of my all-time bad games purchases was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone on PC, which I finished in a weekend and my dad sold to some like an orphanage or something.
You sold it to an orphanage.
It was something like that. Well, I think it was a very low price.
Yes.
Yeah, I think so anyway.
My sister had that one on PC as well.
But the thing is, I didn't learn my lesson because the next year, well, first of all, I played that one and thought, well, this is rubbish. Then me and a friend, I pressured my friend down the road, Donald, into renting the PS1 version which had the notorious PS1 Hagrid in it. That one is slightly better than the PC version, but it's still not a good game.
It's a platforming puzzle adventure where you don't even press the jump button. It jumps for you. It was so simplistic and not very good really.
PS1 Hagrid wasn't notorious back then. That's like a meme that's arrived since. Do you have a memory of seeing him at the time and thinking, well, there's something off about this Hagrid?
No, because I actually thought they did quite a good job of creating a sort of, not with Hagrid specifically, who I will agree is very cursed, but they did quite a good job of not trying to make it look like the film. It's probably because they didn't know what the films looked like, so it was under lock and key or whatever, but they created a sort of story booky, kid sort of like book art style. I think the characters are quite stylized, but it worked for the PS1's visuals, but it wasn't good, it definitely wasn't good.
And then I didn't learn my lesson for the next year either, because when I was on a holiday in Florida, and I went to the local game stop or wherever, and I bought the Game Boy Color Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but that was a banger, you see, because that was actually a Japanese RPG they'd made for that platform, and it was pretty good. It had a rad bowling minigame as well, Harry Potter notoriously spent a lot of time bowling.
Yes, so they famously go bowling for that half-hour sequence in the middle of the film, yeah.
But the ultimate one I never learned my lesson on, I was curious if you had this too, I never learned my lesson on James Bond. I mean, I didn't want Agent Under Fire, my parents bought that for me, but the Game Smags at the time were quite big on saying that 007 Nightfire was good, and they were kind of like giving it eights and stuff, and I ended up buying it because of that. And I think that was, I think in retrospect, I could admit that wasn't really a best-in-class first-person shooter, you know?
It was kind of like...
That was a big ending.
It was similar. Well, it was like a similar quality level to a lot of EA's licensed stuff at the time, where it was like glossy, but just quite empty, you know what I mean?
That era of PS2 first-person shooters, which didn't have the kind of like mega-wow kind of graphics factor of the PC games, but they also didn't have the charm of the N64 game. That era of Medal of Honor and James Bond, they just all had this certain kind of lifeless sort of sheen to them. We definitely did buy and play bad James Bond games.
We knew full well what we were getting ourselves in for. I mean, this happened on N64 too. I knew that no one who worked on GoldenEye had anything to do with The World Is Not Enough, and I knew that I hated The World Is Not Enough as an actual Bond film.
So I was like, well, I'm not even interested in seeing this story again, but you still buy it, just in case they were wrong. Everyone deviated from what was good about GoldenEye straight away. Like, no one ever went, oh, let's just do that.
Like, no one really ever did a proper attempt to just clone in GoldenEye. They all made them very linear, removed all the bonus objectives, made them really fussy. The World Is Not Enough had loads of, like, instant failed bullshit in it.
If you shot, like, your taser watch into an NPC, you'd be like, oh, James Bond doesn't do that. But my James Bond did, and he did it a lot. That poor receptionist at the bank at the start of The World Is Not Enough, she got tasered a lot.
Yeah, it's sort of like the vehicle sections they added too, which were, you know, prime sort of like EA need for speed territory, right? So it made sense they do those. But then the car sequences are nothing like a James Bond chase sequence, because it'd be like, it's like 25 cars.
You're going to blow up with rockets. Like, which film does he do that?
So yeah, it was very irritating. EA sitting on that license was incredibly fucking irritating, because they would just make this shit when they could easily just put another year into one of these games and make them genuinely good, but chose not to, chose to make them shit and chase that dollar. And it worked because they got to use GoldenEye's reputation to sell their shit James Bond games over and over again.
They kind of should have been put on trial for it somewhere, like in the UN or something.
It wasn't an eye-opener though, because I think that process was the means by which I learnt that games were made by people and different people, you know, like, I think I went into it, you know, after GoldenEye, I had the genuine thought of every James Bond game is going to be good because of James Bond. And then you go, well, actually, and you start seeing the scores for like, you know, I was really envious that Tomorrow Never Dies was coming to the PlayStation instead. And then you saw like the drubbing it got, and you were like, oh, okay, something's changed.
What's changed? Oh, it must be these these people are the they're the reason that this thing is good rather than the thing itself. So not not like a radical revelation there.
Well, well, no, but that's where like, you know, you switch your focus to perfect dark instead, right? Because you're like, well, this is where these people went.
Yes.
This is the thing that matters. Yeah, I think everyone kind of goes learns that lesson their own way. But, you know, I sort of like, you know, even with The Matrix as well, I didn't buy the end of The Matrix.
I knew it was going to be, I knew it wasn't going to be very good, but I needed to see the extra footage they'd obviously shot for it because, you know, they did. Wachowski's literally filmed the live action footage that's in the game, and they filmed it at the same time as the films. So, you know, it was even though who gives a fuck about Niobe and Ghost.
A game where the whole concept is, do you want to hang out with the two incredibly bad hangs from the film universe?
Well, I didn't, I didn't mind Niobe, I quite, you know, Jada Pinkett Smith circa early noughties, you know, that's a big thumbs up from me, dog, collateral. I was definitely sort of like my jam. These days, not so much, I would say.
The vibes these days are off, let's say. So yeah, it's sort of like, I was, I was game for it and I, it was technically very impressive Enter The Matrix, but it was also just all over the place again, very unfinished feeling.
The end of that game was going down a dark pipe shooting those squid octopuses. Like that was the grand finale to that game. The big set piece was the bit everyone hates from the films is like, oh yeah, let's, let's let's go out with a bang.
Let's do that for 10 minutes.
Yeah. And then ended with going under by Evanescence over the credits, just taking a cap off the early noughties ass experience of that game. Also just had that terrible objective.
We had to like shoot out the front tire of like an airplane coming down, like a runway. And the airplane was so poorly rendered. It just looked, just a completely unfinished the whole thing.
And yeah, all over the place really. But also it had the germ of the thing I wanted, which is impossible fights against agents. That's something I just wanted to do more than anything else.
I dreamed of that. And then I didn't learn my lesson again, because I ended up buying The Matrix Path of Neo, which is a much better game, but still not a good game really. But I did at least wait for that one to fall to about 18 quid instead of paying full price for it.
But again, I just needed to, you know, you have these other fixations when you're a teenager and you want these games to like fulfill that for you. And they so often just fell short. But even though I knew they were going to be bad, I still just couldn't learn my lesson because if they if a game got like a 71 or something, there was enough ambiguity there.
I just needed to find out what happened, you know what? Maybe there's be enough to tick the boxes. And sometimes, you know, like the Lord of the Rings games we talked about on that episode we did a couple of years ago, like the Two Towers game actually did tick that box for me.
It was quite short, but it was it was pretty good, I think. And then the Return of the King one was pretty good as well. So they weren't always duff.
What do you think their reputation starts to change, Matthew?
A lot of people would probably think they'd go away, but they actually just go and live on Wii and DS, like we had to deal with a lot of this stuff. And it was it was really rank. If anything, they hit like an all new low with that casual audience because it unlocks like a new tier of licenses that you would never have touched beforehand.
Because it's like this thing's being advertised on daytime TV. So all of a sudden shows that are on daytime TV become like valid video game concerns. And so you end up with 10% games based on all the quiz shows your mom watches and likes.
That was really dire. You know, I don't think there's like one mega disaster which scares everyone off. Maybe it's just the fact that there isn't a DS anymore, but people don't need to make these things.
Well, I think that's the thing. I think the returns just diminish when you have to make the games in HD. And, you know, the landscape becomes more competitive and it suddenly looks like you're making ass.
And you just can't churn this stuff out so quickly and have children buy them. I also think that a lot of the stuff went to mobile games. And there's a lot of like really, really dog shit licensed mobile games that are the similar deal, like the city-buildery things where it's like pay more to play now.
Just all of that absolute shit. I don't even really consider games.
Clash of Clans reskinned with Paw Patrol.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it was, but I think the moment that their reputation started to change can be isolated to a single game. And that game is Batman Arkham Asylum, because that game is not based on a license.
It's not based on a film license. It's based on the character license. But they, despite maybe some skepticism, they're going to pull it off.
They've only ever made one game before. They went for it with this original story set in the, you know, the name that's in the title Arkham Asylum, this one location, put you in there with a bunch of Batman villains. And you were sort of like trapped in this environment basically.
And it's sort of like a bio-shocky take on, you know, on this, on this asylum. As you kind of like figured your way out, this Metroidvania sort of structure to it. Just a super credible, like cool game that actually pushes a couple of different genres forward.
It's, you know, it's a very, it's a very good stealth game. That's not that complicated to play. That's kind of what it does.
I suppose it's building on Assassin's Creed there, but it also has a layer to it that is specific to Batman and not really linked to Assassin's Creed, which is the hanging from gargoyles bit of it, which again, ended up being influential. Spider-Man would borrow from that. And then at the same time, this, this sort of 360 degree sort of brawling, a free flow combat system as well was, you know, a genuine innovation.
And so you had this game that took the license seriously, did a really good job, and then also was a great game in its own right and pushed these genres forward. And in different ways, so a really important moment. And I think that starts to, I think this maybe leads to the end of the, like, NAFA Marvel games, or at least like it allows them to subside a little bit.
We don't have as many of them in the decade that follows. And then I think it starts to get people thinking laterally about what can you do with a license that maybe has some films or TV shows tied to it, but you're not necessarily just regurgitating what they're doing. So I suppose like you could say that Star Wars The Force Unleashed did something similar, because it's an original Star Wars story that wasn't tied to a film, but, you know, much less successful than Arkham Asylum, you know, creatively.
So, yeah, I think that's the moment it changes. What do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, I'd buy that. And also just the success of that game proving that you can marry that sort of iconography with something which is critically beloved and it does pay off.
Do you think license are more commonly associated with quality these days? Do you think that that has happened in the years since Arkham Asylum released?
I guess with budgets being what they are these days and like the risk attached to these games, the idea of just selling something on just the title alone doesn't seem to happen very much. I'm just trying to think of like proper licensed games that have come out in the last couple of years and, you know, they're all incredibly sumptuous, sort of serious efforts. IP is so precious to everyone that you have to kind of treat it with a certain level of respect that it didn't get treated with before.
Yeah, I think so. And then, you know, even stuff like the Hot Wheels games, for example, are quite well liked, you know what I mean? It's sort of like the license alone.
I don't think there's the same level of contempt where, at least on consoles, this probably still happens on mobile, where just the license alone is enough to kind of get you through the door. I think that they are being married to, you know, at least like a refined version of a game type that you know, or something like that. There are obviously failures along the way, but, you know, the ways in which Marvel's Avengers fails are very different to the ways in which a licensed game in the 90s fails, you know?
You see the effort that's gone into it, even if the game is not that good. So we've definitely been asked this before, Matthew, but are there any licenses you think don't get enough love or have potential to be a game?
Only because I started listening to one of these books on audio books recently. I'm really surprised no one's tried to do anything with one of the Brandon Sanderson books.
All right.
Just because he's massive, he's got this really like, uh, obsessive fan base. And as a gamer himself, like, I've never read anything, I'm listening to Mistborn on audiobook at the moment. And it's clearly the work of someone who's very into video games.
One of the reasons he is beloved, apparently, is his, like, magic systems are very sort of mechanically thought out. And in those systems, you're like, well, this this feels very video game. So in this book, people kind of like eat, it's really dumb.
They like eat metals, right, then like digest them, sort of burn through them in their stomachs to get, like, magic powers. So it's kind of like eating as ammo. And I'm surprised no one's gone, oh, that could be a video game mechanic.
That's that feels like an RPG thing. Yeah, maybe that.
That's interesting. Does that frustrate you when you read a book and it feels like it's too video gamey? Does that feel, like, maybe not, actually, because of the mystery books you like, are very gamey in their structure?
Not at all. You know, like, it's just a product of the times. Yeah, but it's fine.
Yeah, it's allowed.
No, fair enough. The one recently where I was like, I never even thought about this as a game, and then I saw a rumor about it and I was like, oh my god, that is such a good idea for a game, was Scream, because it's rumored that Supermassive is making it. And if I could work on any game, I would love to, like, that's the game that I think would be a dream game to work on, because you can get the voice, I'm guessing you can get the voice of the, you know, Scream, but the pretty, pretty easily, right, the killer pretty easily, like you get that guy.
And if you get that guy, you can basically lead into every single video game horror trope. You can do that. You can do all that stuff.
You can do like an intro where you're in a house, like watching TV, and then the phone goes off. You can do all that stuff they do in the film in a game. And like just that the idea of that is really exciting.
So if they are making that, I hope they really land the plane. Yeah, because I think that the potential there is extremely high. But it's actually like a few sort of like different horror series.
I think they would make some pretty cool games. Like I think the Hell House LLC films are on Shudder. Like those are basically like what if we did a slightly shitty sort of haunted house and opened it for business, but it kind of went wrong.
That would be quite fun, I think. And all the Escape Room films, Matthew, like those sorts of things. Obviously, like I know this sort of like you got the room games.
There's a very, very different vibe. But like the idea of that in a more horror context leaning into that sort of like those sort of Resi 7 sort of like moments you had where you had like a trap and you had to kind of get out of it, this saw style traps, that sort of thing like that. That could work.
There are also rumors that there are more saw games in the works. I'm not really a fan of that series. But, you know, again, like that's maybe something that feels slightly unexplored.
But Scream is the big one where I was like, I really want to fucking see that. I hope that is like good as hell.
What they show of the game should actually be the fake game from the start. So like you start playing a game, then it zooms out and you see what the actual game looks like. So they should do like the meta reveal.
They should do a little bit like you think you're going to be playing as this famous person for the whole game and they get killed right at the start a la Drew Barrymore.
Think of all the different video game stuff you can riff on. Like the idea of audio tapes. You pick up an audio tape and you hear the, you know, the sort of scream, sort of like the voice on it.
And like he makes fun of the idea of how contrived video game audio tapes are. Like, do you know what I mean? Like that there's like so much potential to do that sort of thing.
So I hope that that's what they do with it. And it's less more less of a kind of like, we try and make it feel like the film's kind of element because man, there's so much potential there. That's I heard that I was like, fucking yes, let's do that.
That's the thing. There's so much room now, I think, for high quality original takes on licenses. And that's where things have changed significantly, I think.
I suppose like to flip that, Matthew, are there any licenses you wish they'd stop bothering with?
This is probably more just like the desperation of a person who's had to review too many of these things, is like endless Dragon Ball and Naruto retellings. Because the story is like finite, everyone's seen it. Like either these games make up a new storyline, which is always shit.
It's always, here's like an adventure you didn't see from the whole arc, and they went off and did this instead, and that's rubbish. Or it's a really garbled retelling of what is basically a 500 hour long story, and they try and crush it into 10. I find them very hard work.
Yeah, Dragon Ball FighterZ though, quite a nice circumstance.
Yeah, I realise there are definitely exceptions. Except for that role. There was a good Ubisoft Naruto game on 360.
It had like the 2D fighting sections you'd expect from a Naruto game, but you also climbed around a 3D recreation of that world, and it felt very expensive, and it looked like Naruto Path of the Ninja, I think it was. That was good.
I only have made one Naruto game, and it was Ultimate Ninja Storm or something, and I only had it because I stole it from the Play Cupboard on PS3, so yeah.
Yeah, fighting game had lots of quick time events. They just released like the 6th iteration of that. I think it's called Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections, and you're like, no thank you.
That's interesting, from a big Naruto head. The Naruto-Boruto thing is not something I've looked into, the differences therein, but I'm sure it's very meaningful to the people who follow those. The license I wish that people would stop bothering with is Marvel.
I think that those films are going to drag that license down, and it's like, it's already happened, really, like the Marvels is absolutely cratered, which is unfortunate, as the only the second film they've made that's really got any women in it, which is unfortunate, or third film, rather. But like the, it's like that whole license is sort of like, because there's so much of it, the entire thing is dragged down every time there's something bad or inessential, and the last few years have been just like absolutely terrible for that brand. And now I think if you make a Marvel game, you can't release it without prejudice, you know what I mean?
Like people just are going to be tired of the license coming into it. There's not going to be that excitement to see it, I don't think. And the fact that Marvel, Marvel's Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Midnight Suns all flopped, suggests to me that it ain't going to happen, like all those games needed to come out in 2019 or 2018, you know?
And now it's kind of passed, like Spider-Man is an exception because Spider-Man is basically as big as all the other Marvel characters put together. That's such an evergreen character. And you know, I think that Wolverine game will do very well as well.
But when I see like EA's making an Iron Man game in a Black Panther game, those I'm like, I don't know if they're going to, you're going to want those to sell like 10 million copies, and I don't know if it's going to happen. You know what I mean? I just kind of wish they'd leave them a little bit and then maybe if they can creatively recover the MCU, which I don't think they're going to be able to do, honestly, I think it's kind of done for a little bit.
I think that it might be a bit, people might feel differently about it in a few years, but unless you've got a mega fresh take, being anything like the MCU in how you present those games is probably just not going to work out. That's kind of how I feel about it. So, yeah.
But they can keep making Star Wars games though, Matthew. We still don't have that many of those, so yeah, they're very welcome. Are there any upcoming licensed games that you're actually mega pumped about, Matthew?
I mean, we know nothing about it, but in machine games, Indiana Jones, that is obviously exciting.
Oh yeah.
Based on nothing apart from Todd Howard going, it's going to be really good. I am interested in Wolverine to see what Insomniac do with that. Wolverine's an interesting character in that you can go quite violent with it if you want, or you can do quite a toned-down safe version.
And I don't know in a video game what people would want or expect. You'd imagine something relatively safe to sit alongside Spider-Man, but very hard to say. A lot of that character's attitude is quite hard to get right in standalone things, as we've seen in the films.
And the only one that's ever nailed it as a standalone film took it in a very dark, edgy direction, which I just don't really see them doing. So, two games we know nothing about that I am interested in. Yeah, I can't really think of many others, to be honest.
James Bond, of course, but another one, really, where we don't think about it. So, yeah.
On paper, brilliant match. You know, IO have been making great James Bond games, basically. It's whether they sort of hold their nerve or feel the need to simplify it for a more mainstream audience.
Or is it enough to speak to the Hitman fans who would just play a re-skinned Hitman? I don't know.
I think it actually is looking, apart from those games, which I agree that are the sort of unknown quantities in a lot of ways. I do, you know, Indiana Jones in particular is, you know, I just really, really want to see that. That and 007 actually, I'm just like, I hope they really nail those because there is so much potential.
And for podcast episodes, there's so much potential for podcast episodes.
Well, there's that, but also just that they are long dormant, but they used to be flourishing, you know what I mean? There used to be so many games for each of those licensors. And now it's been like decades, really, without, you know, removed from that period.
So, you know, that is one factor there. I think that Star Wars does actually have a lot of potential, sort of like outlaws I want to believe will be good, even if I thought the E3 demo just looked like a very familiar experience. There's nothing wrong with it, look very polished.
And as mentioned, love the fucking fly from a planet into space thing. That's still something that I really want to see in a game and makes me excited. So that's cool.
Not sure really when that Quantic Dream game is coming out. Not totally convinced that exists yet, to be honest. They announced that way too early.
As we've discussed before, game announcements are basically now recruitment ads. So that's basically what happened there, I think. Then there's also the fact that probably the next Star Wars game we'll end up playing will probably end up being the third Jedi game, because they're just really fast at making those and they are locked into that.
They seem to know what they're doing with it and they're still hiring people for that team. So that would suggest that that series has got another entry to come, which is exciting. I think there's probably more we don't know about.
There's also a first-person shooter that Respawn is making that is inspired by Dark Forces 2 Jedi Knight, which is totally my sort of thing. Also, some former X-COM people are making a turn-based game as well. So lots going on on that side.
But I don't know if I ever really get like... I don't think any of these things will seem exciting to me until they're on my doorstep, and then I'll be like, fucking yes, let's go, if they look good. But I don't really sit around thinking, I hope someone makes a game based on X.
I just think that when they do do it, I'm just like, well, that is intriguing in the modern age to take a punt on such a thing. So yeah, I wait and see basically, Matthew. So Matthew, should we take a quick break and come back with a draft?
Let's do it.
Thank Welcome back to the podcast. So, the draft part of this episode then. The premise, we're building a sort of mixtape of games.
There's a bunch of licensed games that will arrive in the post, let's say on a Switch cartridge or something like that, and you have to pick the best one. There is a twist to this though, which I'll go into shortly. So, basically there are 10 categories here, and well, maybe it's probably makes more sense to go through the categories first, Matthew, then discuss the rules.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, go for it, yep.
Okay, so, category one, movie tie-in. Category two, TV show tie-in. Category three, 90 plus on Metacritic.
Category four, guilty pleasure. Category five, side-scroller or 2D game. Category six, 90s favorite.
Category seven, bad license, good game. Quite proud of that category myself. Category eight, cursed.
Category nine, the Coronation Street, the mystery of the missing hot pot recipe wild card category. So, basically it has to be either the license is weird, or they adapted it in a weird genre. The classic wild card category I've seen in many Back Page: pod episodes, Draft episodes.
And category 10, free pick. I'll go through those once more before we start. But the rules here, so movie and TV show tie-ins have to have tied directly into something.
Arkham Asylum would not be eligible.
That is not a tie-in of the Batman films.
No, or the animated show. Like is, you know, links them, absolutely, but not strictly a tie-in. So it has to be tied in for those categories.
Otherwise, I think the categories could become too blurry. And the other, the twist here is the cursed, the cursed pick, that has to be something that's actually cursed. Like the more successful a pick for that category is, is based on how cursed the game is.
So the normal rules of quality do not apply. So neither of us can try and go, I don't know, what would be a good example of this? Like, well, the Rugrats game I mentioned, for example.
I suppose you could pick that, but it's not mega-cursed really, apart from like how the babies look, I suppose.
We're not trying to smuggle a good game into that category.
Exactly. We are trying to, basically, we know that the duff, weird, bad things are also part of the licensed game story, and we want to reflect that in a category.
I think that's also sort of true for a wild card.
Yeah, I guess so, but I've actually, well, yeah, I guess that is true.
I don't know, that's what I've really struggled to think of anything good for.
Yeah, I've got something quite good, I think, for that one. So, yeah, as long as you don't beat me to it. But yeah, okay.
So yeah, so Matthew, any other thoughts on these categories in terms of how we've approached this?
I don't know if there's gotta be a little bit of debate about what qualifies as a bad license for bad license good game.
Right, right.
There's lots of things you could get in there if you honestly feel the license is bad.
Yeah, but no one's gonna argue that, you know, like Die Hard is a bad license, you know what I mean?
Yeah, so to be fair, I feel like there still may be some debate about movie tie-in, TV show tie-in. At one end of the scale you have, say, Aladdin, a direct scene-to-scene remake of a film. At the other end of the scale, I'd say you have a lot of, say Star Wars things, which exist around the films, and I don't know if they count.
Well, you know, your beloved Revenge of the Sith game, that would count, for example.
That would count, but like, would FZ1 Racer count?
Yeah, yeah, because it ties into the film and it released at the same time as the film.
What about games, this is very hard without like, revealing any thoughts, what about games that sit filling the gap between films?
What would that include? That's got to be a very small handful of things, right?
Is Enter the Matrix a movie tie-in?
Yeah, yeah, because it came out at the same time as the movies, I think that's fine. So, yeah.
Okay, well we'll see them a bit late, we'll see.
It depends how far removed it is from it as well. I think there's... I think you kind of know a movie tie-in when it's in front of you.
You know what I mean? I think also, we should also depend on the other person to audit the pick a little bit and challenge it. You know what I mean?
Like there's an element of that to this too. Okay, so yeah, okay, interesting. So yeah, I agree that some of this is tricky.
I think the Bad Licensed Good Game is actually maybe the hardest category. There's only a few handful of picks for that one. The wild card category is tough, actually.
Tougher than I thought it would be, actually. Yeah, kind of got there eventually. And then yeah, Cursed is sort of like, well, take your pick, really.
There's actually like hundreds of games you could pick for that one, really. But the one I've got is the one I considered the most cursed at the time. So yeah.
Okay, so Matthew, shall we do the old coin flip? Decide who goes first?
Yeah. What do you fancy?
Tales.
Tales.
Okay, so how this works then? So whoever, well, I get to pick whether I go first or second. If I go first, I get the first pick.
If I go second, I get two picks before it reverts back to Matthew. So that's how it works really. It's snakes for the first pick basically.
But before we get into that, I'll just read out the categories one more time. So category one, movie tie-in, two, TV show tie-in, three, 90 plus a Metacritic, four, guilty pleasure, five, side-scholar or 2D game, six, 90s favorite, seven, bad license good game, eight, cursed, nine, wild card, 10, free pick. And you'll get a vote for the winner in the pinned tweet at Backpagepoll on Twitter.
The poll has been breaking a lot recently, but I still don't have a better solution to that for now. Sorry about that. I don't want it to be like a broken poll.
That still requires you to have an account. So unfortunately it's the best we've got for now. So then, when I go first, I think I will go first, yeah.
My first pick is going to be category one movie tie. Then I'm going to take GoldenEye. So there are other things I thought about for this.
I did think about Scott Pilgrim versus the world, but I think in terms of the ultimate movie tie, and GoldenEye is that game really, that in terms of a game that's specifically tied to one movie, it is better than the movie it's based on, really. If we're being honest, it expands the world of the movie. It takes tiny scenes and blows them up into entire first-person shooter levels.
It's very front-loaded in terms of the, I would say the best levels come near the start or right near the end.
How dare you cast shade on caverns?
Some of those are really hard work on a replay. It's a very old game. It's one of the first good first-person shooters on console.
Obviously, it's dated in loads of ways. But as tie-ins go, this was the most coveted, most wonderful thing to play and enjoy in the 90s, so it has to go there. Matthew, what do you think of that as a first pick?
Yeah, it's a really clean pick. It makes me think I've got to come up with an equally clean pick rather than some bullshit that I was planning for movie tie-in. Yeah, I mean, big nostalgia play.
I know the listeners like it. Have the listeners replayed it recently? It doesn't matter.
They like it.
Well, if you play it on Switch, you'll probably hate it because the controls are so confusing that you'll wonder what the hell is going on. In some ways, I think they're re-releasing it. It has debunked it a little bit, which is tough.
Yeah, but it's a classic.
It is indeed. So what's your first pick, Matthew?
For my first pick, for bad license, good game. I'm gonna go Chronicles of Riddick, Escape from Butcher Bay.
That's the pick for that character, yeah.
Yes, yes, finally a good pick.
It had to be like 20 drafts.
It had to happen eventually. I was really worried about this one because I thought you might argue that it was a good license or you might argue that I'd defended the license by picking it once as a guilty pleasure film.
No, it's got Vin Diesel in it, mate. It's not good.
Yeah, the thing is, if this was an adaptation of Pitch Black, you'd be on a flimsier ground because that film is semi-critically acclaimed. But luckily, this is the only good bit of the Chronicles of Riddick mixed media universe. Starbreeze first-person narrative adventure sort of puts you in the body of Riddick in this prison.
You have to escape from Butcher Bay, as the title suggests. But it's just one of the most convincing. Or use of the first-person perspective outside of just like a straight shooter, like the physicality of being in the prison, the boxing, the fighting in it is really, really solid.
It's a really good use of Vin Diesel's kind of acting range, limited acting range. Very, very desirable. As a non-Xbox owner, I was spitting with rage that I didn't get to play this back in the day.
But yeah, when I finally played it on the 360 re-release, it really held up. So, bad license, good game.
Yeah, in some ways, I think this is the Starbreeze category. And all the picks I have for this are either Starbreeze Games or Starbreeze Adjacent.
Oh, interesting. I know that there are some bad comic book licenses out there, but I don't necessarily know what they are. I don't know if they are good or bad, so you have a slight advantage on me in that.
Maybe, but like, I'm not gonna come out here for the Spawn game, for example. Do you know what I mean? Like, it's this on Xbox.
That's not gonna happen. But yeah, I think the Chronicles of Riddick is a very clean pick for this category as well, because there is nothing else exactly like it. And yeah, it is wonderful.
It's so, so good. So I'm guessing you're taking the Assault on Dark Athena version, so you get the game and the extra bit we did for it, right? Yeah.
Glad to put it out. But yeah, an all-timer, an all-timer. I love that game so much.
It's a real shame it's lost the time, because that license has surely got no value. Get that fucking thing on Xbox Series X now. That's what I say.
My second pick. For 90s favorite, I'm gonna take Blade Runner.
Oh, that's a good pick. I thought about that too.
Yeah, so not quite a straight adaptation of the film. I think they referred to it as a side call in that it's taking place alongside the events of Blade Runner. It means you bump into lots of characters from the film.
You get to meet that guy who makes all the eyeballs. That eyeball guy, remember him?
Yeah, great guy.
A brilliant attempt to capture the look of those films using pre-rendered backgrounds that were absolutely gorgeous. I mean, it's such a fun, clearly defined world to work from and that they're able to build that out and take you into places you don't get to see in the film but feel like they belong in the film. A very moody detective game in its own right.
Do I actually love it as a complete narrative experience? It's got a slightly confusing structure in that the time it takes to do stuff can cause the story to branch and it's not always clear exactly how some of that works but as a Blade Runner experience, it feels like the real deal.
Yeah, it's a weird one, this, because I think it is sort of like, it's stated in the ways that I think all point and click games are kind of dated from the time. But I think the look of it is extraordinary. Like it's amazingly rendered, sort of depiction of that world.
And I think as well that since the game came out, the film's reputation has only really climbed in reputation too. So, and if you're looking for more to enjoy that is adjacent to Blade Runner, you basically have, you know, the 2049, obviously, from 2017, but then you also have this. And there's not loads else besides that, like other things to kind of get your teeth into.
So I agree this is good. It's a shame that that redo they did didn't quite pan out the way people wanted, but you can play the original still on GOG or Steam or whatever. So it's...
It should have done a side call to the sequel where you just follow like what Harrison Ford's up to for the like runtime of that film, just bumming around Las Vegas in that jeans and t-shirt.
Yeah, and got that guy who played him in The Fate of Atlantis to do the voice, Matthew. Yeah, that'd be good. I was thinking about that film the other day, actually, because that's a weird one in the sense that I feel like I'm against everyone else in terms of how I feel about it.
It just didn't do it for me that way. Apart from how it looked, it actually felt a little bit, I don't know, I thought the story itself was straight to DVD a little bit, even if the film is, the film, there's nothing about the film that's straight to DVD, like the way it's rendered, like the way the city looks, how it's shot, obviously, by Roger Deakins and how it sounds as well. All of that is amazing, but the plot, the idea of like, there's a, you know, that Deckard's got a kid with Rachel and then the Jared Leto thing, and then there's some like weird sort of faction who are like, oh yeah, we're in favor of the AI.
I just thought it was all quite, yeah, like just felt like a sort of, I don't know, sprint of the mind's eye. We wrote a tie-in book that came out after the film sort of thing. Like I just, there's something about it that doesn't feel authentic to me.
I can't explain why. So that's a weird one for me. But yeah, this game, on the other hand, it actually like looks and feels like the film does.
So yeah, perfect. Okay, right then. So back to me.
I'm gonna take category two TV show tie-in. I'm gonna take The Simpsons Hit and Run. There were other games I considered for this, the South Park Games, for example, because there are two of those.
There's not necessarily the cleanest pick between them, I think, for a draft, because the first one's kind of considered better, but there is another one as well. I don't know, I couldn't quite unpick that in my head, but there is only one good Simpsons game, and it is Hit and Run, and it's still not that good, but it is highly coveted. I've last picked this and probably last discussed this for our Xbox versus GameCube draft, one of the most tense episodes of this podcast, because I'd just started working in PR, I was very nervous.
And so, yeah.
It's nice that you can now celebrate this in a more relaxed episode.
Yeah, The Simpsons Hit and Run is basically a GTA ripoff by Radical Entertainment, who would later go and do prototype and incredible whole-cultimate destruction, they were big on the GTA, sort of like open-world rifts. This one sort of like approximated the look and feel of The Simpsons quite well. It was, but the main appeal was being able to drive around bits of Springfield for the first time.
They had to geographically map out what this world looked like. And it was very appealing on that level, even if I think it's sort of like it's, it's sort of like charms are limited by the fact that the game is quite annoying. It's quite annoying to drive around, your cars blow up quite easily.
And the sort of like Simpsons of it all does, you know, there are like loads of characters around. They got the voice actors, they got like a writer for the show, Matt Selman, to do the script. So they did, they did all of that.
There is the very cursed music that is not Danny Elfman music. That is, that is not so good, or Ralph Clausen rather. But I do think that as a depiction of the Simpsons and their world, this is probably as good as it will ever get.
And I wouldn't be surprised if at some point they do a remake of this, because there is a lot of built-in nostalgia for this game. It sold an absolute ton of copies. So on the list it goes, thoughts, Matthew?
I replayed some of this for when we did the GTA Clones on trial.
Oh yeah, yeah.
I get it. You know, you're a much bigger Simpsons head than I, so I know that this is quite a treasured thing to said Simpsons heads. It was a little bit like punching robot bees to start off with.
It's fun enough, but I think it will do well as a draft bit.
For TV show, it's actually quite a narrow field. It's like there are not many, there are many notoriously bad games that are based on TV shows, the likes of The Shield or whatever, like this, you know, Miami Vice. There aren't many out and out good ones.
So it was, yeah, it was kind of, it was between this and South Park and no others to me really. Yeah. So, okay, interesting.
So what's your next pick, Matthew?
For 90 plus on Metacritic, I'll take Batman Arkham City.
Interesting.
I would have taken my beloved Arkham Knight, but it didn't get a 90 on Metacritic.
Because of the Batmobile, mate.
Because idiots didn't understand the Batmobile.
No, they understood it. They understood it would get a profit.
No, they didn't get it. They didn't get it. But that's okay.
It's okay. A misunderstood genius of Arkham Knight. Okay, this, you know, this isn't sort of tied into anything specifically other than the Batman license.
But as a depiction of that world and what it's like to be Batman and stalking a really iconic range of villains, Arkham City is a proper action adventure masterpiece. I love the kind of metroid element of it. I think the size of the city you get to explore is quite well judged in that it gets to feel very, very tightly designed and maintain that kind of metroid-y complexity without kind of blowing out to like, you know, a giant sort of Spider-Man city where the city itself is just a backdrop and not as sort of meaningful as a result.
Mechanically so tight studio on top of its game. People love Arkham City.
Did you really go with people love it for the Arkham games? Yeah, they do love it.
I love it.
Well, I think this was the peak of my excitement around the Arkham series. Like when it, you know, I was, before Knight came out, I thought, oh, this is going to be the one. Then Knight came out and I did love bits of it, but a city, I think it just had the right balance of everything.
The scale, you know, it felt like a city, but it didn't feel like overwhelmingly large. It felt still, but it still felt like a real place. The way the villains were used, I think was probably, well, actually, it's probably on a par with Arkham Knight and how the villains are used in that one too, because that's got some cool side quests, but I just love the mad hat stuff in this.
We talked about the Mr. Freeze boss, like you don't like before.
But yeah, the boss for me is him up in his tower, I just don't think he's very interesting.
Every other part of it worked for me, though. I like the catacombs with the Ra's al Ghul stuff, and I think they just did a good job of making it feel like a more multi-layered setting, even though it still had some recognizable connections to Arkham Asylum. So it worked really well.
I just love the step up in ambition, this was just playing this in like Christmas 2011, I was just like enraptured by it. I just adored it so much. I just thought, I can't believe they made a thing this good that ties into this character.
I love this much. So well done, everyone. Yeah, hallmarks for good licensed games.
So yeah, good stuff. Good pick, Matthew. Back to me then.
Can I take my free pick off the board, I think? I'm going to take Alien Isolation for category 10 free pick. One of the best horror games of the modern age and not strictly a movie tie-in, an original story.
That's the one I was thinking about. I was going to ask, would that have counted?
Right. I don't think it does because it's decades later and doesn't feature. It's not really based on the movie.
It's sort of connected to the movie, but is it canonical? I don't really know. It's sort of like, you know what I mean?
It's in a weird ambiguity space. Alien's Colonial Marines would be the same deal. Not that you'd ever pick it, obviously.
Maybe you'd pick it Curse, actually. It's not strictly based on that film. So, Creative Assembly's first-person horror game, where a very powerful, AI-powered alien basically pursues you through a number of different bits of a larger space station, essentially.
In the midst of that, they experiment with all kinds of different ways they can fuck with you, whether it's like lights coming in through the windows of the ship and they are using that to create shadows with the alien, even the geometry and the levels looking a bit like the xenomorph. That was a really cool touch. The fact that they have human NPCs sometimes, so you have to contend with the NPCs as well as the alien.
So, if they make a load of noise, maybe that will make the alien appear, but if it does appear, maybe they can lure the alien away from you, giving you very limited amounts of ammunition to deal with the alien. So if you hit it with a flamethrower, you can guarantee you'll get rid of it, but you can only do that maybe two or three times, and then you can no longer do that. Sometimes you'll see drool dropping from a shaft and it's there waiting for you to kill you instantly.
Just really fucking amazing shit, frankly. A very long game, and I think that probably if you're playing it now, you might find some frustrations with how unpredictable the AI is. I think that is one of the things that people raised at the time is you can't always know how it will behave and therefore the game can sometimes feel unfair with the way it will psychically work out where you are.
I think that's like a criticism that I don't know if I hold against it, but I understand why people feel that way about it, if that makes sense. But what an amazing looking bit of alien paraphernalia this is, just worthy of the films and that's saying something.
It's kind of why I was sort of eyeing it up and toying with it for movie time, just because if you know the story behind this game and the people who worked on this game, they embedded themselves so much in the film. It's as close as you'll get to the films as any of these alien games ever would. It just doesn't happen to be about specifically alien one.
And there's the DLC set on the original ship, right? So that's kind of closer, but anyway, it's off the board now and I got to deal with that.
Yeah, that's your burden to bear. So what's your next pick, Matthew?
Oh God, I've only got shit for Wildcard. I think that's the one I'm going to play last, just because I'm struggling to think of a really good one for movie tie-in. I'm going to take The Warriors.
Oh, okay. That's a really good pick.
Yeah. So obviously doesn't release at the time of The Warriors, you know, a good 40 years later. But in a similar way to like Alien Isolation is a very comprehensive love letter to both the content of a film and the look and vibes of the film to actually kind of capture the visual style of the world of The Warriors.
Obviously, this gang trying to escape lots of other gangs. This game pads the story of The Warriors out, gives you a bit more kind of context around it. So offers everything the film has and more.
We've talked about this. This has been drafted a few times before it's a bit of a draft favourite, I think.
Yeah, yeah.
Mainly because I think it also represents like a really fun part of Rockstar's history of a very film literate or a certain era of film literate publisher and just interesting to see them connect with that directly and make a direct piece of, you know, a game that ties into direct piece of film history rather than kind of vaguely parodying it through Grand Theft Auto. You know, I'd love to see this kind of approach to film tie-ins more, you know, there's so many great films which if you, you know, and you do see a little bit, like I, by all accounts, that new RoboCop game has a bit of that energy of like clearly made by people who just really dig and get the look and sound of the film and kind of capture it. But yeah, this one, this one gets extra points for being the literal story of the film.
Yeah, that's my fucking Christmas game jam right there, RoboCop, I've just got to sit there and see. Fucking sat there, installed in the Epic Games press account, that's, we're absolutely doing that with a bunch of eggnog on Boxing Day. Yeah, so, good pick, I think.
The Warriors is just a game I love. It's a great brawling game that is built on the bones of the old PS2 GTAs, of course, in terms of the rock star sort of technology and how those games felt, but the brawling is actually really nicely done. Obviously, you have the built-in film thing of all the different gangs who are represented really nicely throughout the game, but instead of just seeing them in the background, like you do in the film basically, then the film moves on because it's a very momentum-based film.
It's a quick film. It's just there's a bunch of them they encounter along the way and then before they get to Coney Island and that's the whole film. Here it's like the background of who the warriors are.
You join the gang. They get into all these different fights beforehand and then I think the last third of the game is basically the film, so great tie-in and, yep, it is a draft favorite. I'm sure it will be drafted again at some point.
Yeah, love it. Okay, cool. That's a really good pick.
So I'm going to take my 90 plus on Metacritic, Matthew, I'm going to take Marvel's Spider-Man 2.
Your favorite.
Look, I've had a very testing couple of months, right? And Spider-Man 2 had to pay the price in the midst of that. But I think I have to represent Spider-Man in some capacity in this list, because it's such a key part of, like, licensed game history, the journey of them getting it right and wrong, wrong many times in Activision's case.
But, you know, it's sort of like they got there eventually and like, did really, I really love that PS1 game, as we as we mentioned, it was just sort of like had a great sort of 90s comic book vibe, really, really cool for the time and just seeing that character and being able to swing around the city in 3D, you know, even a very limited way was super, super cool, brought in a bunch of different Marvel characters from other places, too. Then obviously you jump forward in time. There's a slightly naff first Treyarch game on PS1, PS2 of the Tobey Maguire films.
You're like, well, there's some potential here, but it's all indoors, Spider-Man bits, no one wants those. Get to Spider-Man 2 in 2004 and they fucking boss it, but there's still bits of the game that don't work that well, like the combat and the side missions and stuff, they don't end the boss battles. They're weaker where the swinging is fantastic and otherwise gives you the Spider-Man fantasy one.
Fast forward years later, 2018, Insomniac, really nail it, just get the feel of it right. The combat is pretty good as well and the story is fantastic. They get the angle right.
And then Spider-Man 2 this year just refines that. This has a clean 90 on Metacritic. And I think of all the different superhero games to pick, this probably makes the most sense because freshest in the memory, it's the most refined, it's a very comprehensive vision of Spider-Man's world.
And yeah, just I think even though I didn't love all of the side content in it and wish the boss battles had fewer phases or maybe didn't have phases at all, and I put that parry back in the box, I don't think that should have been in the game. But everything else about it was pretty great. So I don't mind having it here, Matthew.
What do you think?
Yeah, I mean, it's my favourite of the Insomniac games. It had the right balance of scale and spectacle. Wrap it all up in 30 hours for 100% completion if you want, which feels about right to me.
Really liked the setup of the story and definitely the pacing of the first two acts. I thought was a really nice take on the Venom story. I think it's slightly weak in the actual Venom bit at the end.
Accelerates towards the end quite quickly, but yeah, and also just looks absolutely amazing. Cutting edge open world, beautiful lighting. Yeah, really impressive.
Yeah, good stuff. So yeah, I sort of like, I guess I think Arkham will probably have a slightly more nostalgia about these people than this. But this is a good ass game from this year.
So it's all good, my friend. What's your next pick?
For guilty pleasure, I'm going to take X-Men Origins Wolverine.
That's a good pick.
Guilty pleasure in that it can't be too good. And this game, it's only just good, I'd say.
It barely gets there, really.
Yeah, but like as a kind of God of War-y kind of clone, you know, 3D third person brawler. What I liked about this is it took the incredibly anemic X-Men Origins Wolverine film and basically treated it like it was an 18 rated violent game with what if Wolverine was soaring up men with his claws and blood was going everywhere. It's got a really nice visual effect where the more damage Wolverine takes, it kind of chips away his flesh and reveals his adamantium skeleton underneath.
So he's like a kind of gory walking health bar for himself, which I like. Like how this came to be and how Raven were allowed to make a very violent tie into quite a soft peak, like 12 rated film or PG-13, I guess, in the States. I don't know.
But as like a cheap and nasty kind of curio, I think this scores some points for that. This is the kind of thing which if I'd been 12 or 13 when it came out and had watched a bad Wolverine film, I would have been desperate for like an older brother or older friend to have bought this for me in game. This would have been a much desired thing.
It kind of fits into the sort of salacious mortal combat, soldier of fortune kind of category of you want it because you're not meant to have it. It'd be nice if it was actually a more accomplished fighting game underneath it, but it will do as a guilty pleasure.
I think it's a great guilty pleasure because, let's face it, when they do... Marvel, MCU Marvel is never ever gonna make a film like Logan again, really. It's all gonna be like 12A products to sell to families because that's what they make now.
And so this does feel like it's a bit out of time, doesn't it? It's sort of like, it is so violent, strangely so. But it is fun despite being like nowhere near best in class of third person action games from the time.
It's sort of like, yeah, it's a classic seven out of 10, really. So yeah, I think it's a good pick for this particular category. Lots to pick for this category, I think.
It's actually quite an interesting one. Yeah, so yeah, it's a good big Sammy pandemic era purchase that one.
I thought that might be one you wanted.
I kind of, I think I've got four different games written down for that category and I can't decide which one to pick. It's actually like, it's hard, it's hard. 90s Favourite is another one where I've got like four different games and I'm like, oh, which of these, they're all good angles, which is the right one.
It's like, in some ways, there are some categories that are competitive. There are only a few that you really wanna get off the board and then some which are wide open and it's the art of curation, isn't it? It's tricky.
All right then, so it's back to me, isn't it? For side-scholar or 2D game, I'm gonna take my beloved Astro Boy Omega Factor on Game Boy Advance. Thought about the old Turtles in Time for this one or the other Turtles game they did last year, Shredder's Revenge, but that didn't even make a big enough impression on me to put it in my Game of the Year list last year.
I thought it was nice. It was a very beautifully-
Don't psych it off because it may get drafted yet.
Well, I know you're not gonna pick a way forward game because now you feel about those, Matthew. So that's, they're out. So pick a size-scrolling game by Treasure, the absolute all-timer, sort of shoot-em-up devs.
And this game is an adaptation, I think, of the manga. And also, I guess there's an anime based on the manga. Either way, it looks and feels exactly like the manga does.
And it is a retelling of parts of that story. And I've definitely talked about this before, but this is one of the best Game Boy Advance games in how it looks. It's just a really beautiful looking shooter where you're going through the futuristic cities and all kinds of different gorgeous environments with lovely pixel art and background and characters who are animated wonderfully.
But the twist of it is, you have to finish it multiple times to see everything. You'll only see some of the story your first time through. And at the end of the first story, you lose.
It's like a big, basically like a fire. Everything's on fire and it says, the end. And you're like, oh, shit, that's depressing.
And then it's built into the plot that you go back in time and try and fix things basically. So really nicely done. And that involves going through like new levels and filling in gaps of levels that were missing, finding hidden characters to build up this larger story and lead to you actually like winning, to this overall win state.
But it's also just a cool game about you playing a little robot lad where you like burn through loads and loads of robots using big beams and attacks that spin in different directions and all kinds of cool shit with amazing power-ups along the way. Just like a real treasure. Just an absolute favorite of mine all these years later.
I've been playing it on the naughty and burning device and it still holds up. It's really, really fucking good. All treasure games hold up really though, don't they?
They're pretty timeless. So yeah, you have played this one, Matthew Cutmember?
Yes, I'm mainly in preparation for the long overdue Game Boy draft. That's about as far as my prep's gone.
That's cool. So how did you find it? Did you think it lived up to the hype that I've given it?
It's like a more approachable skin, I guess, on like a scrolling shooter. It is gorgeous, even with no connection to Astro Boy. It's like just very, very charming, very winning.
That's how I feel about it as well. I don't know anything about Astro Boy as evidenced by my failing to really talk about the manga in any meaningful way.
I've been watching that Pluto on Netflix.
Oh, I've heard that's good.
Yeah, which is like the, it's based on an Astro Boy story. I know fuck all about Astro Boy, so I don't know how different it is. I'm guessing very different, because it's like hour long episodes where robots kind of debate the philosophical quandaries of whether they're alive or dead.
And you're like, I don't know if this was Astro Boy's vibe.
That wasn't covered in Omega Factor anyway on GBA. Yeah, long text sections. That wasn't, is it good?
I've been thought about watching it.
It's Old Mr. 20th Century Boys and Monster Urusawa. Cerebral adult manga slash anime.
Hmm, interesting. Yeah, definitely. I'll get that watched after Scott Pilgrim.
It'd be a nice contrast, I think. Okay, good. So that's my pick, Matthew.
What's your next one?
Pure nostalgia play for side-scroller 2D game. I'm gonna take Aladdin on the Mega Drive. Will this work?
Do other people have nostalgia for this? But I wanted to have something from this era of games where a lot of effort was put into making things, which looked into our eyes at the time, like you were playing the film. Obviously, it's a bit more rudimentary now, but still, a gorgeously animated game.
Check it out on YouTube. You can sort of see the way they've captured some of the character quirks from the films. Follows the film quite closely.
Has delightfully Mega Drive-y takes on the soundtrack. You know, that particular sort of sound chip blipping and blooping away. More of a nod to an entire era of decent 2D platformers.
I could have also taken Quack Shot. I could have taken Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in the Forest of Illusion. Is that what it's called?
Castle?
Well, there was two. There was another one. Maybe it was World of Illusion.
It's the kind of co-op one I played with my brother a lot, but they were made by Sega. So they just, they were very handsomely made games. And I find that every once in a while, someone will try and do one of these throwbacks, like wave forward or someone will try and do a kind of 2D.
You know, there was like an, I think there was a 2D Epic Mickey 2 game, which I didn't think much of. There's that one at the moment, which is like Mickey Mouse. It looks a bit like that Speedrunners game.
2D, quite sparse environments with like 2D animation on and just looks quite charmas and grim. And even like when they remake DuckTales or whatever, these things just don't hold up in the modern day. But as like a relic of a certain time, I'm happy to include it.
Not as cool as Astro Boy, admittedly, but whatever.
Yeah, I saw like, it was tricky because I think Turtles probably was the other pick, but I get the sense you're not mega passionate about that.
Either it may still be picked.
Oh yeah, that's true, actually. So yeah, okay, fair enough. Okay, cool.
Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think there's like a weird balancing you have to do here of like, of nostalgia plays versus actual good games. And it ends up going all over the place really, as evidenced by my picks going from, you know, the immaculate Marvel Spider-Man 2 and Alien Isolation to the Simpsons hit and run.
So it's tricky out there, man. Okay, let's get 90s favorite off the board. Oh, there's, I've got two paths here.
Well, I've got three paths really. Three things are weighing up. I've got Diar Trilogy, TIE Fighter, Alien versus Predator, 9.98.
You've already got Alien 2, you don't need more Alien on there.
No, I probably don't, but they're very different. That's the thing. It's got three campaigns, Matthew.
Yeah, but like, but you know that people who don't know the games will just see two alien games and be like, you just know that irritating people on Twitter and Discord are gonna be like, too much alien in Sam's.
Yeah, well, irritating people on Discord.
Even though you've only got two picks, they'll be like, too much alien and you'll get annoyed by that.
Yeah, that is a very accurate prediction of what's going to happen. So you've got Die Hard Trilogy, which I think is like, I think the first, I think it's probably not held up in any way, shape or form as a game experience, but is unlike any other licensed game in terms of the license they picked. Just, you know, what if we just did like 80s slash 90s movies as the basis of a trilogy of games in different genres.
That's look, that looks good in the draft list, but I've got no, I don't think I'm gonna pick another Star Wars game. So I'm gonna take, I'm gonna take Tie Fighter instead. And it's a chance for me to finally fucking pick that in a draft because me losing out on that is obviously a famous moment from this podcast.
Oh, it's one of my favorite PC games, so.
Yeah, lies.
Tie Fighters are the bad one, Frank.
You piece of shit. Yeah, so Tie Fighter, yes, you do indeed play as the Empire in this. It is told from the Empire's point of view.
And yeah, it's sort of like, it is a very compelling look at what it's like to be the bad guys. The mission design is also a lot better than it is in X-Wing. It's just, it pushes that series along in a bunch of ways.
And it arguably never gets as quite as good as this again. I mean, you might be able to make a case for X-Wing Alliance, or X-Wing versus Tie Fighter, if you were playing online at that time. But for that single player, what does it feel like being the Empire feeling?
There's just nothing else like Tie Fighter. And it does hold up, because no one really makes games like this anymore, obviously, because they've, well, the squadrons happened, but it's not really the same thing. There's just something so pre-Disney, Star Wars about Tie Fighter.
It's just, it's just like, it's straightforward. It's like, you know, you're sort of like, you're working for this, you know, for the emperor, basically, just this shadowy, you know, feeling of like, this kind of grim meritocracy and the feeling that you're flying in these pieces of metal that could be tore out of the sky if you're not the very, very best. And you can't sort of like take it basically.
And just at the same time that the way that the ships like look and feel in the cockpit, just spot on really. Tie Fighters is a fucking classic. So that is the one I will pick, but it wasn't easy Matthew.
So yeah, what's your next pick?
Hmm, that Coronation Street category is so hard. Getting something good in there is really hard. I still haven't really thought of one.
I'm just desperately, I'm hoping that you'll pick one and then it will inspire me. For free pick, where do we stand on The Witcher games?
So I think that here's how I feel about it, right? Cause I thought about this too, because you could pick, you could fill this list really with, you know, Baldur's Gate or Planescape Tournament and those kind of like D&D games, right? That's one angle you can take.
I suppose in my head, I thought the spirit of The Draft is sort of going for more of the movie, TV show sphere of stuff, you know what I mean? Like there's, that's why I haven't picked the Metro games either, you know what I mean?
That was my next question.
Well, but I'm not, but they are licensed games. So I can't, I suppose while I haven't necessarily picked with that in mind, I do think they count. So I will allow it, my friend, I will allow it.
Also, I do have one book adaptation I'm probably gonna take. So if that helps to increase something else to you, I might as well be transparent instead of like talking you out of your own picks.
Listen, I'm gonna put it to the voters. I'm gonna let them decide whether this falls within the rules. I'm gonna take The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt as an adaptation of The Witcher books.
Obviously it's a story of their own telling and devising, but I think it's true to the spirit of The Witcher books in that all The Witcher games kind of feel like episodes from Geralt's life. You know, you kind of drop in there. They've always framed by Dandelion telling the story of the game at some future point, like he's relaying the tales.
That gives the games like a slight sort of literary feeling that you just kind of turn up and see what adventure awaits you. Also, just the structure of The Witcher and the character of Geralt. What's done in the books is very well suited to games in that he is this person for hire.
You know, he wanders the land. He can get into any story that basically hires him to be involved with it. And the game follows that as well.
It obviously has a central storyline about the coming of the Wild Hunt that you're dealing with. But what most people remember and really love about this game are the amazing side quests and the side contracts, you know, which end up being substantial quests in their own right. As you kind of wander into these little towns, find out what ails them, get involved with like the small cast of characters there, probably get pulled into a moral quandary or two and have a pretty amazing, dense adventure in a couple of hours.
And then you move on to chipping away at the main quest. So that's why I think the sort of particularly in three, like the strength of it being open world is it allows you to kind of live that traveling lifestyle a bit better than the other two, even though they also have a sort of episodic nature to them, which, which lets them mimic the books. If it was redundant to talk about like the look and feel of the world in a way in that this is like a weird, a weird license in that it probably defines what many people think of when they think of The Witcher now.
Like if you read the books, I certainly, you know, I hear Doug Cockle's voice and I think of that particular character model. Sometimes I think of Big Geralt, just because that's been ruined for me by PC Gamer. So if you feel that's too flimsy as a licensed game, then so be it, don't vote for my collection.
But it's a really good game. I was also toying with Borders Gate 3 for this as a Dungeons and Dragons licensed game, but more people like The Witcher and cynically I want your votes.
Do more people like The Witcher even now?
Borders Gate 3 is the better of the ball this year, but The Witcher 3 is, I'd say, a much, a much more substantial thing that people are into. I think Borders Gate 3 is better, but I think The Witcher 3 is more popular.
I would do literally anything to never see a tweet again about how much people fancy Astarion or whatever, like honestly, like some of the worst tweets of the year.
That's the annoying thing. It's like this year, everyone's gotten really excited about Borders Gate 3, a game I really love, but they've got excited about it in the same bullshit ways they get excited about everything. It's more about like, what does this game let me say about myself and how thirsty I am for people in general?
And you're like, thank you for that, the internet.
Not to sort of shame people out of what they like, but I think there's no good version of being horny online, but it just, no offense, but it just isn't.
Well, that's why this is not a horny podcast.
Well, indeed. But also, as we discussed, it is performatively horny, isn't it? It's like, is this actual hornyness or is this just an engagement?
Yeah, I don't fancy anyone in Borders Gate 3. They're all fucking nightmares. You'd have a bad time with any of them.
The stuff you'd have to work through. The only person who's tolerable is my own incredibly middle-of-the-road fence-sitter of a hero who I custom-made. He's the only fucking reasonable person in that world.
I don't think there's a single game character I even thought about fancying this year.
This year? I think you're never going to say ever.
Well, I see them more as colleagues, do you know what I mean? They're people I go to work with, so yeah, I don't know.
Because you play as a character as well, they're that character's partner, not yours, you know? It's like that person is Commander Shepard's girlfriend, it's not my girlfriend.
I don't know. In 2009, I was in the headspace of Yvonne Strahovski will be my girlfriend at all costs. I've been there, but these days, I don't know if that's where I'm at necessarily.
If you've done all that thirsty stuff back then, everyone would have called you a pig. So it's just like how things have changed.
Well, I did and they were right, do you know what I mean?
I was playing Spider-Man 2 and I was like, Mary Jane, an incredibly beautiful portrayal of Mary Jane. It looks a bit like Alexandra Daddario, they've given her that look a little bit, but I'm not really there thinking I fancy Mary Jane. So it's nice, Peter and MJ seem nice together.
What a nice partnership, good for them. There's no thirst factor involved really. So yeah.
This is not a thirsty podcast.
Indeed. That's just not where we're at. So back on track then.
So I'm going to take category nine, the kind of hell category, the wild card category. I'm going to take Parasite Eve, Matthew.
Oh, interesting.
Yeah. So just to be clear, this isn't like I thought of the game, then thought of the category. I actually thought of the category and then thought, oh, this is actually quite challenging.
Tell you what I did think about actually. I thought about Virtual Springfield because that is quite a oddball way to give you a portrayal of the Simpsons world. It barely counts as a game really.
It's more of a interactive desktop-y thing, but it had original Simpsons stuff in it. But instead of going for Parasite Eve, it's like a unusual survival horror RPG take on a book, where there are some characters from the book in it, but it's otherwise an original Squaresoft story. I talked about it on a What We've Been Playing episode this year.
I got about halfway through it and thought it was pretty good. It looks very visually similar to Final Fantasy 8, which is why I find it very appealing. PS1 game, it amounts to, I would say, a slightly Resident Evil presentation in terms of the survival horror, but the actual combat is turn-based, so you can move around in real-time, but then you pause to take actions.
Pretty good game, pretty cool game, a bit of a cult object. Thought it was a slightly unusual pick for a wild card category, Matthew. So here it goes.
Any thoughts on that one?
It did actually cross my mind, but only because I have the book, but I haven't played the game. I thought, oh, I wonder, and I thought, nah, maybe too niche, or I don't think I could pull it off, or argue the case for the game, but you have played it, and yeah, that's a pretty good fit.
Yeah, I put in the work, you know, I went on to the PlayAsia, I got the US dollars for PSN, I put it into my dummy USPSN account, I fucking did the homework, so yeah, it's all good. What's the next pick?
The TV show tie-in. I hate it when I pick something that you've already dunked on.
Sorry about that.
I feel like you've just gone ahead scattering fucking landmines everywhere. And now I'm tiptoeing through them.
But it's still a good pick, it's still a good pick.
I'm gonna take Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge for this. I didn't play this last year, I actually played this recently, we were doing some stuff on co-op games at work and I needed to play a bit of it. I'm kind of taking this as a representative of a certain sort of genre of licensed games, which was the side scrolling brawlers, there were other turtles, arcade machines you could have taken, there were the classic Konami, was it the Simpsons one as well, back in the day?
Like the games that you played at swimming pools after your swimming lesson is my kind of relationship to this genre. What I liked about this is that I actually thought it did sand off some of the slight rough edges that you sometimes get in these beat'em ups. Just terms of like fuller movesets, slightly more interesting mechanics with like the way the specials work, that you could kind of charge it up and bank it.
I liked just the visual humour of the way the foot soldiers would come in, like they're often in the background doing funny things and then kind of get pulled into the fight. Clearly a lot of love for the genre. It has a direct connection to the show, it has the voices of the original voices, the turtles in it.
Sometimes can be a cursed move, that when people boast about doing that, because a lot of these voice actors are quite old now, sound quite different. See the infamous WayForward DuckTales remake where the voice of Scrooge the Duck was made like Deathbed when they recorded him.
Yeah, that was a joke I made for this one, if you remember, where there's a bit where one of them goes, I am one tired turtle.
Turtle, yeah.
And it sounded like a 70-year-old man saying that.
Yes, that's right. So tired it may be, but it seemed exciting to my thumbs. So DM&T, Shredder's Revenge, on the list it goes.
Yeah, okay, so I think that is a good pick. I enjoyed this game a lot. I think it, presentation's incredible.
And I do hope that, because I think it is like some former Scott Pilgrim versus the world people who did this game. I hope their next thing is like Simpsons or something like that. Like that'd be really, really cool if they export that.
So yeah.
Here's a question for some things I didn't pick because I didn't think they'd be allowed.
Right.
The Walking Dead.
I think I would have allowed that, the Telltale one.
Yeah, because it has one bloke in from the TV show.
Oh, I think it, actually, I think that might be based on the comic books, that one.
But it has the TV show guy come into it.
Right, but it's the same character from the comic books. Which character do you think?
Yeah, but it's voiced by the same guy as the TV show.
Oh, that is ambiguous then, isn't it?
But anyway, I didn't pick that because I thought, you know what, I think that is comic book, right? You know, it looks like the comic books rather than the TV show.
I think that's what Free Pick is for as well.
Yeah, the other one I wondered about and like a whole thing we haven't gone down to was licensed sports games.
Yeah, that's true.
I was thinking about WWF No Mercy in the N64.
I think I would have allowed that because I just don't care about wrestling games, you know?
But again, I also feel like our audience probably doesn't care enough, but you know, I thought that was me trying to be kind of clever. If something had gone horribly wrong, I had that in my back pocket. But let the three wrestling fans of this podcast know that I do recognize it as a good game.
So you respect me and vote for me.
Amazing. Not at all a crass attempt to.
You just said you didn't care about wrestling. Are they going to vote for that guy?
Well, no, but I even, even I would acknowledge that WCW versus NWO Revenge was a classic. My friend Donald had that. We played a bunch of that, even though I don't really understand wrestling.
I sure grappled some lads in that one. That was a, yeah, grapple.
I sure locked a guy off a ladder in a famous, famed ladder match.
Exactly. That's what we'll do at the live show, is me and Matthew will just have a ladder match. That'll be like the thing that sees out the whole event.
So look forward to that next year. Okay, so, right, interesting. And who's to say I'm not gonna pick a wrestling game for one of these categories, Matthew?
So, right then. So, guilty pleasure. I don't think I can get away with Space Marine.
I don't think The Warhammer Lads would allow me to do that, because it's a beloved enough game that it got a sequel. It is one Metacritic point above X-Men Origins Wolverine. Yeah, I don't know if it is considered a guilty pleasure.
What's your take on that one?
When you said it, I thought, oh, that sounds too good. But it is, like, the Metacritic thing on Wolverine, that changes things a little. Like, I feel like you could argue its case on that ground.
I wouldn't, as you were generous to me with Witcher, I won't kick up a stink whether the voters can be trusted. Who knows?
I don't think it quite fits the profile of the category enough, myself. I really like Space Marine, and I'm really excited about the second one.
So, what you've just done there is what I did with the wrestling. You've established that you like a certain sub-faction of our listenership, so that they vote for you regardless of whether or not you pick a game in that sub-faction.
I'm not that bothered about winning this one, though.
Let it also be known that I love lists every license.
Yeah, Metro Exodus, great game. Now, it's sort of like, yeah, I've just sort of talked about my thought process and also tried to name-check some games that don't come up, basically, because I do think Space Marine is one of the, yeah, like one of the great seven out of tens and the sequel looks really good. So, okay, two more sort of like shortlisted games that didn't make the cut.
007 Nightfire is a game I played relentlessly in multiplayer. I've talked about that before. Thought about that.
Thought about my beloved Shadow of the Empire, but we've got TIE Fighter ticked and Matthew is dunked on Shadow of the Empire far too much. So, this pod for me to pick that. So, a true guilty pleasure is The Matrix Path of Neo.
It is all three films retold minus Keanu Reeves. They still got my guy Larry Fishburne, though he's still in the cast, good. And allows you to play all of the set pieces that Enter the Matrix didn't let you play because they boxed you into some boring stuff that was a side story to the main films.
This is the full thing. You get your lobby fight. In fact, that might even be the tutorial, the lobby fight.
It's for certainly very early on. You get your burly brawl. You get fighting loads of Agent Smiths, all that kind of stuff that you wanted to do in the first game, but you weren't allowed to do.
They finally did it after The Matrix had come and gone. And when the license was extremely sort of like passe, I would say, like the feeling after Revolutions was very much like, fuck these films. I think that was kind of the vibe for a little while.
Now I think we can look back and be like, The Matrix is obviously one of the best sci-fi films ever made. And the sequel reloaded kind of good. Got some great set pieces.
Revolutions is a pile of ass. So that's sort of like where things have landed and that's fine. But The Matrix apart from Neo, I think like one of those things where if you had any interest in those films, you just had to see their attempt to do those set pieces in a game.
And sometimes they land the plane, sometimes they don't. So I think it's a good pick for Guilty Pleasure on that basis. Thoughts, Matthew?
Very coveted, like as a similar Matrix loving boy, looking at pictures of some magazines and going, Oh my God, it's everything into The Matrix, promised to be, but wasn't. Yeah, I never picked this up, so I didn't fall for that trick. But I think this is perfect Guilty Pleasure territory.
Fantastic. So what's your next pick? Is this your last pick?
No, I've got two more. I've got the two shitty categories that I hate. Oh, I just haven't...
The thing with the Coronation Street, the Mystery of the Missing Hot Pot Recipe wildcard category, is that, which I'll remind you, is either the license is weird or they adapted it in a weird game. For weird licenses, I was thinking about times where people have made weird games based on bands or musicians.
You're not going to go for fucking Guitar Hero Aerosmith, are you?
No, not like that. As in, there was a terrible survival horror game based on the music of Queen.
Oh, right. What's that? I don't know this game.
It's called Queen the Eye.
That never happened. You made that up.
No, genuinely. Look it up. It's got the puzzles of Mist.
It's got the fixed camera angles of Resident Evil. I think some of the storyline from it became the storyline for We Will Rock You. It's like a dystopian sci-fi survival puzzle game.
What the fuck?
Set to remixes of Queen tracks.
How did my dad not have this game? It's the most him thing I've ever seen. Oh my god.
I've not played it. I've only read about it. It felt like a suitably weird thing.
After you pick Parasite Eve, I feel I need to try and get something that I actually like in here.
Right.
Would you accept the Star Wars Pinball tables and Pinball FX?
You know what? It did cross my mind. Yeah, go for it.
In which case, I'm taking the Pinball FX, Star Wars Pinball packs, specifically the Empire Strikes Back table, which I was genuinely obsessed with when I was on official Nintendo. Mainly because they were fuck all games on Wii U. They kept releasing these Pinball packs on Pinball FX.
And I really like the Empire Strikes Back table because if you activate the right things, Darth Vader pops out of the table and like force crushes a ball. I was never very good at it. You can ask Joe Scribs this because I sat next to him playing this a lot.
The way the table works that you're kind of working through the story of Empire Strikes Back by lighting up different bonuses and things. But because I was never very good at it, I only ever got along the first few steps of every quest line. So imagine someone like replaying the first half hour of Empire Strikes Back as a Pinball table, like just the Battle of Hoth again and again and again and again.
That is like a perfect snapshot of me in whenever it was 2013, 2014. If you ever listen to the old official Nintendo podcast, you'll know that I picked this as one of my 10 games of the year. This is not a new bit of bullshit.
This is very true. I like pinball tables. I like it when people try and smash down a two hour narrative into a load of weird score multipliers and a few ramps.
I think that's an inherently daft thing to attempt. Star Wars, everyone loves it. So why not?
Why not Pinball FX, Empire Strikes Back?
I've really grown into liking pinball tables. I've gotten older, actually. I think just the intricate construction of them.
As a kid, I thought whenever I walked into an arcade, I've definitely mentioned this before, I had a French holiday where I walked into an arcade that they had marked on the campsite map. It had a pool table and the Star Trek Next Generation pinball table. Nothing else.
I was like, that's not an arcade. That should be illegal to call that an arcade. But the older I've gotten, the more I actually really love 90s arcade pinball tables.
Just the voice clips, the licenses they riff on are sometimes so strange. You've done the Dark Knight one, the 2008 Dark Knight pinball table. That's really fucking good.
I think NQ64 and Cardiff's got that one. It's just really cool. It's got the Tumblr, and it's got all these different, like the Heath Ledger Joker pops up and stuff.
But yeah. Did you have more pinball thoughts, Matthew?
Only that. We used to go on Easter holidays over to Southwold, and Southwold Pier had an arcade, and my dad used to play the Stowell's next generation pinball table there. Long memories of standing by the side of that pinball table, enraptured by my dad's pinball prowess.
Used to play for so long, like when they closed the arcade, they'd give you your credit back. They'd be like, here, just have 20p and come back tomorrow, because this game's not going to wrap up anytime soon. That one was all about collecting the crystals, the dilithium crystals.
I remember teleporting up different members of the crew. The only ludicrously expensive thing that I might buy at some point is a nice pinball table. I've got peers who sometimes buy arcade cabinets, and that does nothing for me.
I would not want one of those things in my house. But a pinball table, like a proper decent one, like the Star Trek one or...
Indiana Jones.
Indiana Jones. We had one in our college common room, which was Medieval Madness, which is quite a famous one. It's got voice acting by a very young Tina Fey in it, weirdly.
So, yeah, I'd love to have a proper beautiful pinball machine. I think they're quite hard to fix and things like that, though, if they go wrong, is the only problem.
A sweet memory about your dad there. You're going to remember that on your deathbed. That's going to be one of the things that flashes before your eyes, along with recording the N64 draft with me and me taking GoldenEye.
I think Martin on NGamer magazine, Martin Kitts, had a Adam's Family pinball table.
All right.
But I think he said it was broken and it was very hard to fix, and that's why that stuck in my head as a thing. Because while having a pinball table would be absolutely amazing, filling my house with a broken pinball table would be the absolute worst thing I could do.
Yeah. I think Bethany used to work at Team17, has a load of pinball tables. I think she talked about how getting them repaired was the biggest pain in the ass in the world, basically, because there's probably five guys who can do them, or if you need replacement parts, there's probably one.
Oh, have you got any of the plastic Gomez's for the Adam's Family? We stopped making this thing 30 years ago.
OK, just that alone. I don't have time for a hobby that has that level of requirement to it. You know what I mean?
Video games are actually quite well suited to me, come to think of it.
Yeah.
OK, good. All right, so you got the pinball game for that. I think that's fine.
I think that's genre. That was probably slightly too hard a category to pick for, to be honest.
The problem with that one is the joke in the title is the best one.
Yeah.
The Coronation Street, the mystery of the missing hot pot recipe is the perfect version of this.
It's like you could have gone for stuff like Lost via Domus, but that's ass, obviously. There's probably more here. I think there's...
No, I don't know. Or you could have gone for... You know what you could have gone for, actually, is Trespasser.
That's sort of quite unusual, isn't it?
Yeah.
Kind of weird. A weird adaptation of that genre. I suppose FPS is not weird, but the hand thing is fucking weird, isn't it?
So, yeah.
Looking at your boob tattoo for health.
I do it often. Okay. So, my next pick, then.
A second to last for me. Bad License, Good Game. So, this really, like I say, is the Starbreeze category.
And so, I think there is only really one truly amazing pick for this, at least one that comes to mind, and that was what Matthew took, The Chronicles of Riddick. I fully accept that that is a good pick, but The Darkness is the other sort of element here at play. So, the pick becomes, do I take The Darkness or The Darkness 2?
The Darkness, a little bit more of a stealth kind of game, a little bit more cerebral, a better story. Adaptations of a Dark Horse comic from the 90s, I think is quite naff, unfortunately. Top Cow was the line that published that one.
I just think a little bit lame, sort of like Mafia Man has a load of monster shit going on. I think that's just like got raw. When artists come up with comics, artists who aren't really writers come up with comics, that's the sort of thing they come up with, no offence to those people.
But The Darkness 2 is the game that said, you've got these cool tentacles on your shoulders. What if they could throw shit and eviscerate people while you shot a load of dudes and then absolutely rip roaring seven out of ten, while the entire reality of what's going on in the story is questioned alongside as you wake up in this, I guess, mental health facility, is probably the best way to put it. And so, yeah, that kind of like mix of elements, just like a really fun, sort of like dyed-in-the-wool, six-hour-long 360 era shooter, really good, probably is slightly better than a seven out of ten, honestly, has this really nice cell-shaded visual style, so it's quite different to the original Darkness, but it's probably the one I'd rather replay.
So, NAF license, fun game, hits the spot. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, that's... Like I said, I didn't really know... The Darkness did cross my mind, but I didn't know if it was a, like, beloved comic license or not, so didn't make the list, but yeah, by that logic, a good pick.
It was this or the House game on DS, Matthew, so House MD, the game.
A couple of other things I had for this, the Mummy Demastered, the terrible Tom Cruise Mummy film turned into a pretty solid sort of six, seven out of ten, way forward Metroidvania, in a similar way to Alien Infestation. Kind of, like, felt like that wing of way forward, what they did after Alien Infestation was probably The Mummy Demastered. Similar to X-Men Origins Wolverine, there was that quite nasty Punisher game, based on the Thomas Jane The Punisher.
Oh, yeah, the PS2 one. By Volition.
Yeah, so that's got a bit of that kind of, like, Mortal Kombat, Soldier of Fortune, sort of naughty, but you sort of desire it. And also that version of The Punisher, that film, is fucking diabolical.
Isn't that game famous for dunking a guy in a piranha tank, and then their, like, skeleton comes out? I think that's something that happens in that game.
They ended up censoring it a lot, but I think you can, like, emulate it and play, like, as it was meant to be done, and it's got some quite gnarly stuff in it. Yeah. The other one I thought about was the X vs.
SEVA. The not-bad GBA first-person shooter based on the... I've never seen it, but I've heard all-time, all-time stinker with Antonio Banderas.
And Lucy Liu, yeah, that's tough. Yeah, so I think that's a good shout as well.
But also, like, who gives a shit about X vs.
The truth is, I did want to create space for Starbreeze in here, because I think they're sort of like... That's like its own track of licensed games. There was no reason for those to be as good as they are.
But it is relevant to our modern moment, because there's a through line between The Chronicles of Riddick and this upcoming Indiana Jones game, right? Like, that's like... There is DNA that stretches between those things.
So, yeah, important anyway. Okay, so have you got one more pick, is that right?
Yeah. It's cursed.
Saving the worst until last.
The worst until last. I mean, there's so many things. Like, what here?
I've got loads. But what is the most cursed? Because have you thought of something more cursed than I've thought of?
There's a really obvious answer to this one. You know what it is. Come on.
Oh, I don't know. I do. But that's...
I'm gonna take... I'm gonna take the Fight Club game.
I don't think I knew that existed. Oh wait, is that the one that's got Fred Durst in it?
Yeah.
Oh, that's a good pick. Well done.
That's cursed, right?
Yeah, oh yeah. Fred Durst. Like, well done.
The idea of making a movie license tie in a Fight Club just goes against everything that Fight Club's about. Like, Tyler Durden would fucking kill the people who made this game. For sure.
That it exists shows a complete misunderstanding of what that film was preaching. That on top of it, it's a piece of shit fighting game. A terrible fighting game.
Without most of the actors from the film. I think the only person who reprises their role is Meatloaf as Bob. And obviously it adds Fred Durst.
Who's just as good as Brad Pitt, if you ask me.
Everything about this is like no one understood Fight Club who made this game. The idea that Fred Durst is in any way a substitute for Brad Pitt and Ed Norton is just insane. I don't feel like I need to say much more about this.
Hopefully its mere existence is cursed enough.
Yeah, well done. The Fred Durst thing is like the... like that's the sort of Michael Fassbender perfection sort of like meme.
When I hear that I was like, oh yeah, well done. That is good. Yeah, so I think there was plenty to choose from.
Superman 64 I think would be the real one.
Oh yeah, yeah.
But I thought that would be too obvious actually and I wanted to pick something. I did play and I did think was like total ass and was so bad. I think it actually like forced a sort of a bit of a reckoning of the landscape of can we keep doing games at this bad because it's just so awful.
And that is The Simpsons Wrestling. Double dipping on The Simpsons there, but it was just so shit. PS1 game cashing in on the late 90s, definitely the sort of like peak era for for wrestling games.
People would probably agree with that. And just like has a very small roster of characters and is just ugliest sin, like awful to play, just like total shit and just like sold because it had the license. It had like original voice acting in it.
But also just like the it's like a parody of a video game that would exist within The Simpsons itself. You got Flanders shouting, Hi Diddley Ho, Hi Diddley Ho, Hi Diddley Ho while like attacking. I played a bit of it this morning on an older boy told me how to access it on the Steam Deck.
And it's just it's really it's shit. It fails in every single way. But it's also just like it's the contempt because The Simpsons was so popular in the late 90s that they sold so many copies despite being so awful.
It's just like like it just there's no reason to make a wrestling game based on The Simpsons. At least it's like a logic to The Simpsons hit and run. But fucking wrestling game.
There's not even an episode of The Simpsons that's about wrestling. There's a boxing episode. They could have done that, but fucking hell, just so shit.
Just like a true insult.
I remember this getting its head kicked in in Gamesmaster. And like I actually think the magazines at the time were a little more forgiving to like Simpsons and South Park just because they were cool. N64 magazine overrated like all the South Park games.
They were universally terrible in N64 just because they were like, Oh, we like hearing the sound bites of the characters that we like. And you're like, that isn't that isn't good enough. So that the Simpsons didn't even that the Simpsons Wrestling didn't even get that pass shows you like how truly rancid it is.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Made so much money as well.
And like, it's just a shame because there are no Simpsons games now. But this would actually be a really good time to make a Simpsons game before all the cast die for one. That's like one thing.
But also just that, you know, licensed games have been on the upswing. The Simpsons is kind of evergreen in its popularity. And yet, we sort of like, it's got such a sordid history.
There's like, you know, two to three good games at most, you could argue. The Simpsons Wrestling was just like Line of Deer. Just like, there were so many dogshit PS1 licensed games, Gotham City Racing, like just so many, the South Park game that you mentioned.
Yeah, but The Simpsons Wrestling, that's suitably cursed, Matthew, to represent that corner of licensed games, I think. So, yeah. Okay.
Fucking weird draft, this one. So that's us done.
I had a couple of other cursed things very quickly, because I didn't know if they were cursed enough. The Sopranos, Road to Respect.
Great one, great pick, yeah.
Just like, low-polygon Pauley Walnuts. No, thank you. That Reservoir Dogs game.
I think that's just a shit action game, though, to be honest.
Yeah, I don't think that's like a 1 out of 10 game. I think that's just like, mediocre, I think.
Any game with Austin Powers in, there was like an Austin Powers Pinball. The funniest thing about Austin Powers Pinball is they basically reskinned it and released it as Kiss Pinball, as in the band Kiss. And it's got the same table layout as Austin Powers Pinball, except they've replaced Austin Powers' face with Gene Simmons' face.
And it hasn't even got any Kiss music in it.
Amazing. Does it still have like, is there like a sound bite of Groovy Baby left in?
That would be the icing on the cake.
Yeah, it would. So like the idea of like trying to make games out of Austin Powers seems so futile. Like it's, yeah, but that just speaks to its popularity really.
But yeah, some good ones there, Matthew. OK, shall we go over our picks one more time?
Yeah, let's see. Are there, were there any winners here? Who knows?
Only losers. Whoever wins, we lose. Maybe we should have put Haley versus Pennington.
OK, category one, movie tie-in. I picked GoldenEye.
I picked The Warriors.
Category two, TV show tie-in. I picked The Simpsons hit and run.
I've got TMNT Shredder's Revenge.
Category three, 90 plus on Metacritic. I picked Marvel's Spider-Man 2.
I've got Batman, Arkham City.
Category four, Guilty Pleasure. I picked The Matrix Path of Neo.
I've got X-Men Origins Wolverine. What a weekend that double bill is.
My weekends now still look like that, to be honest. Category five, sidescroller slash 2D game. I picked Astro Boy Omega Factor.
I've got Aladdin on the Mega Drive.
Category six, 90s favourite. I picked Star Wars Tie Fighter.
I've got Blade Runner.
Category seven, Bad License Good Game. I've got The Darkness 2.
I've got The Chronicles of Riddick, Escape from Butcher Bay.
Category eight, Cursed. I've got The Simpsons Wrestling.
I've got Fight Club. Very similar games, actually.
Category nine, The Coronation Street, The Mystery of the Missing Hotpot Recipe wildcard category. I picked Parasite Eve.
I've got Pinball FX, Empire Strikes Back Table.
Category ten, free pick. I've got Alien Isolation.
And I've got The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.
That is the weirdest draft. I mean, what the fuck is going on? Astro Boy next to the Matrix.
Like, what happened to this podcast? That's very warped. So you can pick, decide who won, twitter.com/backpagepod and then the poll will be pinned there.
That's us done. A few things to note. As mentioned on last week's episode, we're having a break in December.
There are going to be three episodes from us and the Patreon is going to be locked basically. So what happens is I'm going to pause billing so no one will get charged. But if you did want to listen to the Patreon content over Christmas, you would have to sign up before November 30th or otherwise you'll have to wait until January, I think now.
So just a note there in case you fancied listening to the XSales or the XXSales over Christmas. If you are already subscribed, you won't lose access. You'll have everything in there and you'll still receive the pods as normal, but just a bit of admin there, Matthew.
So you can follow the podcast The Back Page: Pod on Blue Sky or Twitter. Matthew, where can people find you?
I'm at MrBazzill underscore pesto on Twitter and on Blue Sky I'm at MrBazzillpesto no underscore.
Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter and Blue Sky. About next week, goodbye.
