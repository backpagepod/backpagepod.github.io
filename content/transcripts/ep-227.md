Hello and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
The day we're recording this, Matthew, there's a new Gta 6 trailer, trailer two. They've delayed the game till the 26th of May, 2026. Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that, first of all, because, you know, it's timely.
I know this is not really what we do on Games Court at all, but seems like it doesn't get bigger than a Gta 6 trailer. I just watched it again before we started recording this, and yeah, where are you at with Gta 6?
Yeah, I'm excited, just so people understand, this is the real Matthew Castle speaking, this isn't Judge Castle or any kind of persona. We haven't yet stepped into the world of Games Court.
The fiction, the rich fictional universe.
Yes, but yeah, I was really into it. I've watched the trailer several times this afternoon. Aside from everything else and how amazing it looks, everything, I just felt like it was more of a sort of vibe check than the first trailer.
And I have a clearer idea of what that game is going to be tonally, I think, from that trailer, which is kind of the mode I prefer GTA to be in, which is sort of fun and hi-jinks and it's sunny and the music's fun and the characters seem a little bit more likable from this tiny glimpse we've had of them. You know, and I know GTA 5 was quote unquote fun GTA also, but even from this trailer, I feel like the two main characters seem like they're going to be quite good hangs. And like that is not true of GTA 5.
That is a fun game with some quite like gnarly bastards in it. That's got me in a good mood. Yeah, I'm into it.
Does the lack of why did I move here? I guess it was the weather, bother you, Matthew? Probably an all time great, or at least jammed in my brain, trailer line.
Is there a version in this trailer yet? Do you think that's emerged?
I mean, it's not a line or anything, but I quite like the introduction of this. Is it Jason, the main character, and one of the main characters, and he's driving along and everyone's just like, hey Jason, and he seems liked, which is just never true of these games. These games, because of their mission structure and the fact that you're always having to do favors for rotters, I feel like you're always on the back foot a little bit in GTA, like you're always sort of ground down, or an underdog or an light.
And the idea of playing one of these games with someone who is a bit more kind of like, obviously likable on the surface, I don't know, maybe that's too much to take from two minutes of trailer, but that was my read on it.
Yeah, definitely some edge softening going on.
Yeah, right.
You know, like how Trevor feels like the swerve from Niko Bellic, maybe this is a swerve back from Trevor towards some kind of like middle ground of, you know, reasonable person.
Again, from this one trailer. They just seem like probably like the most likable protagonists yet.
Yeah, I guess by default, having played a bunch of San Andreas, I think CJ is quite likable.
Right, I haven't done my big replay of that yet, so.
But yeah, I could see that. I can't quite get my arms around what the game is from that trailer, because it is very much a vibes trailer, like you say. But I just count my lucky stars.
I don't have to turn this into a hundred things we've learned. 14 page feature in an Imagine magazine that really just makes me want to sort of like die inside. That's like, that's no longer a part of my life, which I'm very grateful for.
So I did just watch it thinking, yeah, I'll play that in a year. You know, that's that's good. I'll feel old as shit when this is out, but still.
Have you been on the website for it?
No. Is there a whole situation?
Yeah, it's nice. It's got a lot of stuff about other characters and what their deal is, and it talks about the different regions of the map and some of the activities you're going to be doing there. And it just, yeah, it looks pretty stuffed, actually.
If you've only watched the trailer, I would recommend looking at the site, because it gives you a better idea of what the game is going to be. You know, there's a lot of out in the countryside. They've got kayaking down the rivers and driving dirt bikes and things around.
Muddy forests, and I think that's going to be good.
Yeah, yeah, that's not really the usual rock star playbook, is it, when they do this kind of stuff? You normally have to wait until much closer to launch to learn any of those details. So, or there'll be like a video where the narrator going, in Vice City, every corner is an opportunity.
That kind of thing, like five minutes of footage of dudes being shot would happen. That kind of thing. Yeah, I'll check that out.
That's cool. Yeah, I'm pleased it's out there. It wouldn't have really been any fun for it to be six more months of silence.
Over it, and then ramping up in the new year. So I'm glad they're kind of kicking off. Yeah, it's good.
I don't really care about any of the sort of like, oh, what's going to happen to the console sales chat that goes on around Gta 6. That's not really Rockstar's problem. I don't give a shit.
It's not their fault that Xbox is going up in price, is it? So yeah, I look forward to seeing how that goes. It's actually been a pretty bad couple of weeks for the discourse, Matthew.
I found the response to Gta 6 chat are quite... Gta 6 in general is just a little bit like irritating, like everyone had to have a take. And just from what's ranging from, well, I don't really like Gta, to I'm not really going to play this one, so I'm doing my Stuart Lee sort of voice again.
That was good.
That did sound like it. It did.
I've watched a lot of those.
You just got to repeat it a thousand times.
Yeah, and also Expedition 33. There's a lot of weird chatter around that as well. People have lost their fucking minds over that game being made by 30 people and then not 30 people.
But also who gives a fuck? People have made their entire personalities this past week. That I'm confused by.
Am I just online too much or are you also being hit by this?
Everyone is. I feel like it's not the eye of Sauron, it's the eye of Take Sauron has fallen upon Expedition 33. It fell on blueprints before it.
It just means everyone, well, the people who care to chime in on things, which is quite a lot of people, it turns out, will just chime in on something regardless. And yeah, I don't know why. It is as it ever was, but it definitely seems supercharged in the last couple of months.
The discourse, it just happens so fast. It kicks off so quickly, ramps up, reaches peak anger in about a week and then dies off. And I think the Expedition 33 is an interesting one because the game's background story is a little surprising, in terms of it's this sort of team's first game.
People thought it was going to be good, didn't think it was going to be this good. Big surprise breakout success for Kepler, I feel I've been making good stuff without any of it particularly like really kicking off in the last couple of years. This absolutely has.
And because of that, I don't know, the talking points, all the team size stuff, they are a little different. And so we're just hearing what the takes are. Like people haven't had a game of this size and kind to like test their take engine out on.
And now they are and it turns out takes are fucking, they suck and are quite boring. And that we should just enjoy that. A new cool thing is on the scene and that we now have a team who will hopefully make another cool thing in four to five years.
And that's just a success story. Anyone can get behind, right? It's like, oh, there is another potential source of good things in the world.
Excellent. Discourse over.
Yeah, the thing I have the whole all that has in common with the Blueprints discourse to me is that we're just in this moment where everything is all or nothing in in video games discussion like this. There's so much time and energy dedicated to litigating Expedition 33 that you could use to talk about other indie games, other cool things that are happening, sort of like in games at the moment. Like I've seen, I know a couple of people are playing Skin Deep for example, and have some quite interesting things to say about that game, but people are just so fucking, I want to ask every single person who's pumping these takes out, did you know this game fucking existed one month ago?
If the answer is no, shut the fuck up. You know what I mean? I just like, why?
So honestly, it is doing my head in a little bit, just because it's a bit boring.
Do you think people have just got like a bit of SEO brain, where as a culture, like a lot of people, particularly games journalists who are doing this for a living online, they have to make the most of any success story when it happens, like in their day-to-day life. And it's just kind of very wired. A good game isn't just a good game.
It's like desperate to get some content out of it. However, that may manifest. And so we end up with these like bizarro takes, which aren't really anything.
It's just saying something for the sake of saying something.
I think that's true, actually. Like it's just, well, this is the big thing going on in culture right now. So a better way in kind of situation.
I think that that is true. Kind of like a lightning rod effect of pop culture, sort of consumption and discussion. I think it's I think there's something in that.
But it's just a bit tedious. I just wish that people would talk less about fucking like nonsense behind the scenes stuff and just talk about why games are good. People just seem incapable of doing that.
Celebrating with just like a tiniest proportion of the audience will celebrate the actual thing and not be like, well, I think Xbox is doing this and I don't like that they're doing this. And it's just like fucking shut up. Everyone's a commentator on this.
It's so boring. Just celebrate the thing being good.
If you put it out in the world, like I've got some, you know, I've got some praise for the interactive world map in Expedition 33. You're looking at a too like tweet right now, you know, and it's just not worth it.
That's Geoff Keighley-Borgan territory, that one.
Oh, that is, yeah, 100%. I know I've been like, I've, I have existed at that level for a long time.
Yeah, that's been my home.
So I can understand why you wouldn't like naturally opt for it.
Yeah. You are enjoying Expedition 33, aren't you? At the risk of discerning to what we've been playing.
You've been playing a bunch of this, right?
Little cool on it to begin with, and it hadn't quite clicked. But I think once you unlock a few more characters, a few more powers, you start getting the Picto stuff. I think it's the combat system that I really like because it's incredibly modifiable.
You can really shape your party all around one incredibly overpowered character. It's quite an easy game to break in that regard. But I think in a really fun way, it almost has an element of when a bilateral run is really kicking off and you can't believe the synergies you've happened upon.
Except it isn't a roguelike, so you can just... If you've got the smarts, you can make it happen. And that I really like.
A little call on the characters. I can't say I'm feeling that side of it as much.
Not big Gustav head, Matthew Castle.
Not really. I just think they're all a bit sad. Sad people who are quite sad about their situation, even though they're on quite a fun adventure in quite a wonder field land that everyone's quite a bummer to hang out with.
Which is why it maybe doesn't have the total juice as a JRPG. That is important for me. But the combat system, I think, is just...
Where I'm at with it now is absolutely electric. You just pull off some obscenely quick things. You can nuke a boss in a couple of moves, and the game's fine with you doing that.
If you've worked out how to do that, I think that's really fun, flexible design.
Yeah, absolutely. Once you've learned it, you can circumvent the artificial difficulty of the numbers in the game, just by knowing exactly when to dodge at what time. I like that too.
I think that does trust the player, and it does reward you for learning those exact dodge and parry windows, which are not always the easiest to figure out, but yeah, good stuff. I think this game really clicks when you get to the flying waters area, because it's just the first sort of mega-lush, look how fucking amazing this game looks a bit, and the music's so good in that section. That's when I felt myself being like, ah, this is something really special, actually.
So yeah, I don't know, but I think I like the story more than you, and I'm yet to finish it, so there's definitely more to dig into at a later date, Matthew. I look forward to coming back to it. Glad you're having a good time.
Yeah, I'm having a good time.
Okay, helmet on. We're now entering the rich fiction of Games Court. We're going into the airlock, Matthew.
Just sort of like that Mass Effect thing of just like a little beam comes over you, just sort of hoses you down, gets the bacteria off. We are now entering Games Court territory.
Is there a very long loading elevator as we go up to it or down to it? Probably down to it.
Yeah, your 360 hard drive is absolutely fucking whirring. It's just, yeah, it's very, very loud. The 360 getting very, it's about to yellow, sorry, the red ring of death.
So not ideal. But yeah, you push through and then you are on board. You are on board Castle Island.
You are now entering Games Court. So okay, what is Games Court then? This is where listeners send in secondhand purchases they've made on eBay or similar services, and Judge Castle, played by Matthew Castle, who you may know from The Back Page Podcast and NGamer, and Official Xbox Magazine, many publications, will basically judge on whether the purchase was valid or not, and there'll be a comedy punishment if they are found guilty.
I am the lawyer involved. We always stress that Matthew knows nothing about retro games or their value, and so this is not a legitimate exercise in any way, shape, or form. And I invite you to submit more Games Court entries at backpagegames.gmail.com, and also there's a Games Court Submissions channel in the Discord, which you can find at BackpageBot on Blue Sky or Twitter.
And we'll keep doing these, the more entries we get, basically. This is our second one this year, so we already matched the number we did last year, Matthew, where we were so fucking Games Court-verse, we did our best not to make any. Alas, back we are.
I'm still Games Court-verse, for the record. Let the record show.
Yeah, especially on a Tuesday evening. That's never after a bank holiday. It's never ideal, is it?
Okay, so Judge Castle resides on Castle Island. This is all explained in previous episodes. Castle Island is kind of like where it's got all kinds of problems going on, really.
But I'm just going to check in with Judge Castle and see how it's going. Matthew, how are things on Castle Island these days?
Oh, I'm having a terrible time of it, Samuel. Basically, I decided to get the Presidential Palace renovated but I hired the architect from Blueprints and now it's just absolutely hell to live here. Like the rooms constantly rearranging every day, if they even appear.
No dining room, no dinner for Old Castle. Most days I don't have a bed to sleep in. I had to sleep in a tomb, Samuel.
And it was it was really scary down there. I've got five toilets but no water flow. I've not been able to take a shit in eight days.
This is just, it's unbearable. This place is the fucking worst. Here's the real kicker.
I've not actually been able to draft the Games Court room itself, which we normally host this episode in. So today we're hosting Games Court in the only thing I could draft today, which is a sauna. It's so sweaty in here.
It's so hot in here. The towels, they're not big enough to cover PS1 hand grid, so I can see his PS1 stuff. That is terrible.
That's a five-triangle penis right there.
Oh my god. And it's just, and everyone has to deal with that. We're all in towels.
This is super bad.
Fortunately, you did get the shovel on RNG, so you could hide all the turds you'd left around the mansion on previous days. That's good.
Yes, weirdly, there were dirt patches in my living room, so I was able to bury it down there. I got a root cellar today, which added lots of dirt to my house for my turd. So thank you RNG gods.
Yeah, so that's that's a whole thing. I tell you what, don't get me started on the tariff, Samuel. You've obviously heard about this on the world stage.
This has also affected Castle Island. Trump set our tariff rate at 500 percent, even though our only export is bottles of our own pulped listeners, which seems brutally unfair. I'm retaliating by raising tariffs on all watches, clocks, egg timers, calendars and sundials, because it basically turns out that the ungrateful population of Castle Island have secretly been using time behind my back.
Amazing.
They will never forget the day that they messed with me. Well, actually, ideally, they will forget the day anyway.
Because there is no day, there is no concept of a day.
Moving swiftly on. I'm trying to make the most of this bad tariff situation. But I've set tariffs on Toblohn and Haribo to 0%.
Hoping that whichever country makes those, will just start sending more of them here. That would be brilliant.
The Swiss, do they make Toblohn? I'm not really sure.
Yes, the Swiss, of course, they make Toblohn. Who makes Haribo? Is that German?
Germany, I think. Yeah, I think so.
Yeah. Well, come on in. Get some of these 0% tariffs.
I mean, it's pretty obvious from this. I don't really know what tariffs are or how they work.
That's OK. I've got a gag about Taris II, so that's all right.
Oh, excellent. Here's my last bit of news. In other news, we had a bit of a Sinners moment at our annual music festival.
Randy Newman played a set that was so perfectly middle of the road that it summoned the ghosts of all the dead musicians that dads like. It was basically a traveling Wilburys reunion. It was so cringe, it drove all the vampires out of Castle Island.
So that's actually fucking brilliant. I'm quits in.
I'm like, wow, Mike and the mechanics are here. This is brilliant.
Yeah. Imagine White Sinners. That's a terrible pitch.
That's not a great pitch for a movie, I'll be honest with you. But White Sinners. I can imagine this is called that.
White Sinners on IMDB 2025. Oh, that's really good.
That's what's happened.
Lots of great material there. I'm very impressed, Matthew. So, time banned on Matthew Castle Island, in case you haven't listened to a Games Court before.
You cannot have days, minutes, etc. here. How will listeners be executed if found guilty in the courtroom today, or the sauna today, Matthew?
Well, we're sticking with the Blueprints theme. I'm going to be taking anyone I find guilty and I'll be leaving them in a random room from the Blueprints mansion, which is basically lifetime imprisonment until the RNG decides to serve you back up or Samuel plays 5,000 hours of the game to unlock you, whichever happens first.
Okay, good stuff. And who's in the courtroom today? The sauna?
I guess it's quite a small area.
Yeah, please. Who's in the sauna today?
Who's in the sauna in a tiny towel today? Whose junk is on display for the whole courtroom to see?
Oh, we've got some real junk. We've got the guy who looks like Robert Pattinson, but sounds like Daredevil from Expedition 33. We've got a load of blue Pikmin who are looking nervous because a sweating PS1 Hagrid might try to drink them.
We've got Bad Mr. Frosty from Clayfighter. Oh, no way. He's been reduced to a puddle and a carrot.
We've got Jason from Gta 6 sweating realistically from every pour in a way that you can only do if someone spent a billion dollars rendering you. He looks absolutely incredible, this guy. Really putting the rest of us to shame.
And he's running on PS5, which is even more impressive.
I don't know how they do it. We've got the guitar from The Last of Us Part 2. It's not really much to that one.
I just watched that episode last night with the guitar.
I want to suggest more water related ones now that you've gone with that theme, like Squirtle or something. I don't know.
Yeah, what else have I got? Oh, I've got someone realizing after two months that Blueprints is a pun and then tweeting about it.
Yeah, that does happen. Alice Bell posted that today and I was like, wow, people are still learning that somehow.
Yeah. Finally, we've got Samus from Metroid, but she's still in her suit, even though it's sweltering hot, because it turns out she just recently unlocked the Varya suit.
Which I just unlocked last night, Matthew.
Which is, of course, a reference to the Heat resistant suit in Metroid.
Metroid Prime Remastered, right? Is it in all of them?
It's definitely Super Metroid forwards.
Yeah, okay, fair enough. Yeah, just a whole lot of Metroid Prime Remastered. That's good.
Solid range of gags, Matthew. It's time for my opening statement. I am the lawyer in this situation.
I am here to defend people who are put on the stand in the sauna. I don't know how that works, but I'm sure the conceptual will make it work. Okay, little opening speech for you.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, and thank you to Judge Castle for even turning up. I know he was just busy binging the third season of The Wheel Of on Amazon Prime Video and watching the cinematic adaptation of untitled PS4 exclusive horror at 2025, both until and dawn are banned on Castle Island. I hear there's been a shuffle of the guard in Judge Castle's government, the Ben Folds Five are now in charge of culture, immigration and the imports of sweets respectively.
There are three of them, I'm told. Randy Newman is now the Secretary of State. He turned the job down initially and was jailed for claiming he's 81 years old and too tired to do the job.
The concept of years and 81 were rejected by Judge Castle. The mere mention of time means he's now being chased by Mr. X in the basement of Judge Castle's Castle, which has the elegant name of the Judge Castle Castle. I hear Judge Castle has banned the upcoming Switch 2 game Dragon Drive because it draws too much attention to his refusal to build wheelchair ramps around Castle Island.
Another media censorship campaign has resulted in new, confusing cuts of movies like Bandits with Sean Connery. We live in, with Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh, and Good 2017 starring Robert Pattinson. Oh also, Hot Tub Machine.
So ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a few simple questions for you. Why do we let this man decide what does and doesn't count as justice? This is a man whose favourite character in the Inspector Morse franchise is the character played by Lawrence Fox.
This is a man who responded to Donald Trump's tariffs by adding a 150% tariff on Pulped Listeners, the nation's largest export. We had the same gag there, Matthew.
Yeah.
This is a man who would only let Christopher Nolan film the Odyssey here if he could replace John Leguizamo in the cast and be shirtless at all times. I have no respect for my clients, but they deserve every horrible thing that's coming to them for hoarding NAF Wii U games and continuing to support this podcast. Thank you, Your Honour.
Any good gags for that? Was that worth the 20 minute extra wait, Matthew, to record this podcast, that speech?
I love the film titles.
They always work, don't they? That's always gold.
Yeah, I'm a big fan of that. Yeah, I mean, considerably well and truly skewered.
Excellent stuff. Do you have an opening statement as well or is that?
No, I didn't. I kind of like, I sort of burn out coming up with the blueprint stuff.
You're better world building than usual, I would say.
Thank you. Well, I thought I'd try and deliver. I looked at the last ones that we did and it was a pretty sorry bunch.
I think I did the 28 Days Later gag for a second time.
Yeah, I almost did that one this episode too and I was like, nah, that's getting ripe, that one. It's time to put that to bed.
I was going to do something similar about film titles, like films that had been banned unless they re-edited them to not be about time. And I was trying to do something with Richard Linklater's Before trilogy, but then I could… It's funnier if the three films are before, before, before, but that doesn't make any sense because those before suggest time.
And it's, you know, sunrise, sunset and midnight are like, eh, you know, so…
I'll be honest, Until Dawn is basically the same gag as that, so it's tough. Okay, good. Well, that's the making of the jokes in the episode, which is what all the listeners tune in for.
Well, I like that the DVD bonus features are like in… have been inserted into the film.
Yeah, it's like a Zack Snyder cut of it, isn't it? It's unnecessarily long and, and, yeah, you just didn't need to need to know all that extraneous information. Matthew, should we?
Yeah, I think they get what they pay for. Matthew, should we take a quick pause, have a little bit of music and then come back with about 4,500 words for me to read out of fucking Games Court entries?
Fucking yikes, yeah, let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast, Games Court, you get it. Let's get on with this. Exhibit A is from Reg McFly.
I learned that the Wii U had a European-only light gun game released, and I bought the game only from CX for eight pounds, but haven't been able to quit it, and now I've bought the full thing on eBay. This game, Matthew, is called Kokoto Magic Circus 2.
Oh, jeez.
There's two guns and the game. The game is £24.95. I would describe the main character on the front cover as cursed.
It looks like total dogshit. It looks so bad. If you worked on Kokoto and you listened to this podcast, I apologize.
I don't know how to make computer games. I'm not saying I'm better than you or that you're lazy. I'm just saying, not good.
Not good, dog. What's your take on this, Matthew?
It's not good. You've done a bad thing. Yeah.
I don't know if I've played this song with you. I think there was a version of this song with me. We're talking like proper, like 20% kind of reviews round up, sort of fair.
It's more the philosophy behind this. I guess he didn't explain why he bought it other than, like, what, is this someone building a big mad Wii U collection?
I think this guy's just a bit bants in the Discord, you know?
Yeah, that's like his whole thing. Like, there are some consoles where it's worth buying, like, the weird stuff around the edges, because there were so many games that some interesting stuff got pushed to the side. I don't think the Wii U was that console.
Like, the Wii U has a kind of canon of, like, these are the good games. And if you veer too much out of that, you do get into, like, worth this territory. And no one's going to be like, wow, you've got every Wii U game.
Like, that isn't really an achievement, I don't think. So, yeah, this is bad, this is bad.
You know what makes me weird is that Kokoto seems to be a series that was developed by Neko Entertainment and published. It's like a French thing, I think. And then published by Big Ben, also a French company.
So this is on PS2. And then there's like a Wii one. And then I believe it's all gone away now.
But there seemed to be a thing for a while. Was this like a Wii shovelware era thing? It seems like it.
I mean, it had that, yeah, definitely had that flavor. Sometimes you can just tell from a game's name that it's going in reviews round up. That may sound like brutally unfair, but Kokoto Magic Circus is one of them.
Definitely.
Just know you can feel it in your bones.
Indeed. Well then, guilty Reg McFly, but great content. There's a little photo here as well, Matthew.
Which room are we going to leave him in? We could go pick a room from the Blueprints Mansion.
That's going to be the best bit of this podcast for sure. Don't get too excited about the entries. This is the real juice, the slash source.
Should we start with something basic and then we're going to build up? I don't want to put someone in the reservoir straight away. Do you know what I mean?
It doesn't seem quite right. Should we just say that they go in the observatory for now? They're just stuck in there looking at the sky.
The observatory is a fun place.
It's a bit too airy, isn't it? Should I put them in the storage closet? Put them in there?
Or the red lavatory?
Perfect. Toilet then. The toilet is what we begin with.
That means that everyone who's in the courtroom can take a shit. Which is great. That's good news for everyone.
Actually, the plumbing doesn't really... I know I said earlier, just for the record, I know I said earlier that the toilets didn't work because they weren't attached to the plumbing. I know that isn't actually a rule in the blimp prints.
So, before you write in.
Amazing writing. Okay, let's stop fucking BBC Points of View, is it? It's The Back Page.
It's all... they know what the deal is. Okay, Exhibit B is from Tanner.
Thank you Tanner for your concise and solid entries. Quite interesting. My November slash December purchases a combination of reclaiming PS3 and SSX games of my youth and remembering that I have an analog 3D coming so I can play Japanese N64 games.
We start off with The Mighty Mirror's Edge on PS3 Matthew, $9. I don't know if that's good or not really. Could probably get an PC for about a quid.
Prince of Persia 2008, that's $10. I am a big fan of that game personally. I adored this game when it came out.
Tanner says, I look forward to revisiting it. SSX 3, GameCube disc only $24. I had only played Tricky in the last 10 years.
Holy shit, this is so much better. SSX on Tour, GameCube, $20. My favorite growing up.
The soundtrack was massively influential for me. And Mario being in this is so stupid. 64, Dahaken Tamagotchi Minna Da Tamagotchi World, N64, $12.
I had no idea what I was looking for when I saw this in store. Had to Google and search it. Apparently a party game from Hudson Soft.
Why the hell not? Tetrasphere N64, $8. I feel like a classic Tetris game would be cool to have on N64.
This may be the wrong one though. Snowball Kids and Mystical Ninja Goemon, Japanese, $20. Snowball Kids is my favorite kart racer on the N64.
One of my top games on the system, aside from Judge Castle. I got this for Goemon though, which I don't own yet. Finally, Custom Robo V2, that's a Japanese game as well, N64, $26.
I love the G GameCube Custom Robo, which I recently re-bought. This is supposedly the best of the two Japanese only. 64 games have started this series.
I feel like someone who is more hardcore about video games than me has written in here, Matthew, because I don't know what most of these things are. However, quite an interesting selection.
Yeah, I mean, it's one of these difficult ones where there's certain things which are like, they almost get you in stuff are given. Like Mystical Ninja, that's just a good time and should be celebrated. So that, you know, it's quite clever putting that alongside like those that time I get Tamagotchi game.
They are they are. Well, they've been various things, but there's definitely a party game format in there. And it's like, what if Mario Party?
But with, you know, without the iconic characters, with those crappy Tamagotchi anime characters, who I've always found to be quite weak. There's that sort of quite pale looking rabbit thing. Yeah, they're quite a sorry bunch.
Snowball Kids is fine. My sister really liked it when we were kids. And I don't know if I'm just carrying some like, some residual sort of shitlord older brother energy towards that.
I don't know if I think it's a bit mid, just because my sister liked it when I was like 10.
It's quite a popular sort of kids 1064 game this.
It's one of those ones where people are like, one of my favorite games is this like 6 out of 10 Game Boy Color game that I just happened to own. And it's like, well, you love everything you have when you're a kid. But I mean, I can't question it if he likes it, he likes it.
This is such a grab bag. Yeah, I think like terrible. You know, the SSX games all fine.
I don't really know what the consensus is on like, which of which of Tricky 3 on tour is the one?
Well, I think I think that 3 is the one that's got, because I went through this for one of the best Naughty's episodes we did. And I think 3 is the one that added the open world. So you had that on top of all of the kind of like existing SSX stuff.
And that's why people are particularly fond of it. But I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's the case. So this is one you can actually get on Xbox Series X as well.
I bought it and I was like, oh, this is a cool game. It's that shiny, loud EA era, EA big era of stuff. Yeah, I don't think there's probably, there's loads in it.
They're all acclaimed, but people really, people really like it.
Yeah, I just think there's more good than bad here. The custom robo stuff, I can't really speak to it. So that one, you just have to kind of give it a pass.
Okay, not guilty, Tanner. I hope you're welcome for your legal representation there. Prince of Persia 2008, by the way, a bit of an underrated game, not the best in that series, but people who really liked Sands of Time held it against that game a bit too much, I think, in that moment, but it was actually pretty solid, I thought.
Sacred Flame, it writes in with this one, got three different entries here. An older purchase, Jurassic Park Operation Genesis for PC costing £20, somewhere in the mid 2010s. I will say, Matthew, I removed a couple of entries that were a bit too far back and I thought, didn't really count as Games Court because I think it needs to be a bit more contemporaneous to be Games Court to qualify.
This was the second time I had bought the game for £20 as I had lost my original copy that I had bought at some point. Number two, Super Mario Odyssey for £32 in the Glasgow CX some months ago, played through it and loved it. Well, I can't argue with that.
And three, Mario & Luigi Superstar Remake for 3DS in the Glasgow CX between Christmas and New Year for £38. Never played the original as the GBA is older than I am. God, that's cursed, isn't it, Matthew?
Can't imagine someone under the age of 30 listening to this. Will play when I find my misplaced DS charger. Okay, so three games there, Matthew.
Do you have a stance on the remakes of the different Mario & Luigi games that they did for 3DS? I feel like the art style maybe divided people a little bit at the time.
They were all things which are absolutely perfectly suited to their original homes, so I don't think they particularly benefit from losing those art styles or the art styles changing. Basically, I feel like I got everything I would ever need to get out of that game one time on the GBA. I don't think they are massively replayable games.
I'm feeling this way in general about Mario & Luigi and Paper Mario, and it's something that definitely dawned on me when we had the Paper Mario remake last year. I just felt like there's just not enough to it for you to forget enough about it, if that makes sense. So returning to the idea of dipping in a second time, that just makes no sense to me.
So yeah, that's a bit of a bust. The Jurassic Park game, all I really know, that's the earlier management game, right?
Yeah, the non-frontier one.
Yeah, all I really know about that game is from making videos about the frontier one on RPS and getting loads of comments from like weird Genesis superfans asking you like how it differed in in such like ridiculously anal detail. I was like, I just don't know. I have no idea.
I don't know how to answer any of these questions. So I associate that game with quite an irritating fan base. Maybe unfair, but you know, that's how Judge Castle rolls.
Middle game, 10 out of 10, untouchable. You know, can I really put Odyssey into some kind of blueprints themed hell prison?
No.
I don't think so.
Not when it was in. I think it was in the top five of the 95-episode-long Nintendo Top 50, Matthew. So that was...
Yeah, I mean, it's probably one of my top 10 games of all time. So that gets you a pass on an inoffensive, but Jurassic Park game that happens to breed slightly irritating fans. And the other game which I've forgotten about.
Oh, Mario & Luigi, which you should never go back to. Never go back, only forwards.
Yeah, I'm not really interested in Dinosaur Wars, either, but I think you made the right call there, Matthew. So yeah, who cares if it's a fucking Pteranodon or one of the other flying motherfuckers, you know what I mean? Those guys are dead and they ain't coming back, you know, despite the...
Oh, terrible dinosaur names. You a dinosaur guy?
I was a dinosaur kid for about, I don't know, a year there. That happened to most kids, right? I think it was right around Jurassic Park time.
I had the little Alan Grant figure, probably like the only, you know, the idea of Sam Neill as an action figure is quite amusing to me in retrospect. Had the Laura Dern figure where they went fucking weapons three on her eyebrows on that toy. Just out of control on that thing, honestly.
Yeah.
I just like the idea you see Jurassic Park, you go, you know what I want? All the generic people.
We had this argument, but I still think that I'd like to see the universe where, as originally intended, Harrison Ford plays the Sam Neill role. I just think that's got the potential to be so good it like fucking melts your eyeballs. I know that they're very different energy, but you know, you're talking about a very handsome era of Harrison Ford there.
The thing is, you know, when Harrison Ford does his panicked, oh, it's all going to shit thing, that look on his face, like when he realizes something bad's happening in the Air Jones, like him with that face and holding the flair of the T-Rex, that would be like...
Oh, imagine.
You could see that look on his face and you'd be like, that is a face that's looking at a T-Rex.
Yeah.
I can believe that.
I'm watching literally the greatest thing that's ever happened. That's what you think in that moment. Yeah.
Anyway, okay then. Exhibit B is from Peter B. Another one for Games Court.
Having seen a friend play System Shock 2, I was keen to get a copy. However, by 2002, it was out of shops. So I did my research.
Oh my God, this is fucking really old too. I haven't screened these properly, Matthew. So I did my research to try and find out where I could get it.
It turned out my best bet was something called eBay. Age 17, I was too nervous to sign up and put my bank card details online. Mid-age before my time, I had probably seen some BBC Watchdog piece about people having all their money stolen after putting their credit card number into a website.
So I asked my friend Al if he had used eBay before and whether he might buy the game for me. How much do you want to pay was the reply. I was baffled, asking, you can choose?
After a brief introduction to the idea of an auction site, I opted to say that something like £30 seemed about right. £35 is an absolute max. So of course I paid £35 for System Shock 2 and the original Unreal game, unasked for but bundled in.
Just the CD. System Shock 2 got many hours of play but I'll confess I never did install Unreal. May the judge have mercy on me and not feed me to one of those terrifying cyborg midwives from the aforementioned System Shock.
Matthew, I will say for this one, which is so old it's almost impossible for you to make a reasonable judgement either way.
Statue of Libertations has passed on this.
Exactly, yeah. It doesn't matter that you killed your wife. Many years have passed and we don't have the time for the admin.
It's basically the situation.
It's actually okay now that you killed your wife.
So I will say though, having worked with a couple of what I would describe as System Shock 2 bores when Bioshock came out, who told me that this game had in fact been released before and wanted to laud it over me because they could afford a graphics card in fucking 2002 or whatever. Like well done to those people. This was quite expensive for a while, System Shock 2.
Definitely by the mid-naughties, I remember looking up and it being 40 pounds plus. So while this seems high for an old game, I don't think it was in circulation for quite a long time. Then obviously we are so used to being on GOG now, etc.
I don't think it was around for a while. I think in the early noughties, I don't think this is massively egregious. That's my defence before you make your call judge.
A great game and was always being celebrated and really so it was like a mainstay of the best games in PC Gamer always. So whenever you get into PC gaming, you are being told that this is something you have to play. There's quite a few games like that on PC, I think, which are like maybe harder to find or come by, but you're told, oh, well, you have to play this, it's a classic.
I quite like the scared to use ebay, having to get a friend to do it, nervously feeling your way around what ebay is. And if, as you say, the price isn't too unreasonable for what you paid for it, even though it's just a disc, which means you don't get like a nice big box, which is part of the fun, arguably, of that hobby. I don't know, I'm being pretty lenient today, but I don't really have it in me to leave this person to rot in a fucking rumpus room.
Yeah, this doesn't quite seem egregious enough. I agree it's been a bit lukewarm so far, but I believe it will get some spicy entries.
It's your version of lukewarm, we're not just killing loads of people, because that is technically your winning.
Yeah, I mean, I'm doing great, but I always put good podcasting before all other things. Taste, you know, like saying sensible things. It's all about the end product, baby.
Dave Scarborough, you know what I mean? These are all things that I do, that I put before logic basically, in order to get the best end result. So yeah, okay.
Not guilty then.
Scarborough before logic.
I refer to him as my giant son the other day in a text message, even though he's a year older than me. So that's just a bit of context for you, Matthew. Okay, Exhibit E.
Quite a lot of games here, but fire through them quite quickly. This is from Synthetic Man, Matthew. My first Games Court submission.
I've always been a big fan of Nintendo handhelds ever since getting a translucent Gameboy as a kid. Gameboy Pocket as a kid, sorry. I bought into each successive generation except for the 3DS.
Something I decided I wanted to rectify before the eShop closed and to act as a replacement for my aging DS. One of the ugly first gen models. Oh God.
Oh dear God. I couldn't imagine just holding on to that for all those years. Looking at about a billion different DS models are like nine times nicer than that, Matthew.
Here's what I've purchased over the last few years on the DS 3DS front. New Nintendo 3DS, £125. Mario Kart 7, £12.
Pokemon Ultra Sun, £30. Yikes. Metroid Samus Returns, £40.
Majora's Mask 3DS, £33. Hotel Dusk, £9. The Last Window, The Secret of Cape West, £45.
And there's some eShop purchases as well. I'm not sure if we should count these really, because digital in it.
I mean, they're not second hand, so.
No, most interesting in there is that he's got all of the different Phoenix Wright, the Ace Attorney games, Matthew, including the two 3DS ones and bought all of the DLC for them as well, which would later be moots because they got re-released. But they bought Attack of the Friday Monsters as well, which just showcasing is a little bit of taste there. Finally, The Last Window complicates matters as it came out, sorry, it came in a broken case and with a very low resolution reprint on the cover.
That might be fake, by the way, give that a little look. It's also how I discovered that the microphone on the 3DS is completely broken, making a specific puzzle impossible to solve without switching over to the old DS I wanted to get rid of. I've also only played Apollo Justice out of that trio of Ace Attorney games, we're not counting that, but was a bit mad if they released that Switch collection before I got around to playing them all.
So, we've got a range of pretty decent games there Matthew in Pokemon, I know how you feel about that. Prices don't seem too bad to me, sort of like I think once the shop closed it did become a bit hairier to buy some of these games, like the likes of Metroid Samus Returns where it sold alright, but I suspect like millions and millions. Likewise Majora's Mask, what do you make of this?
What was the actual handheld he bought?
It was a new Nintendo 3DS.
That's what I saw, I think you said it was a 2DS. I was like, it's not really the same thing. Yeah, I mean, I like the games, the prices, Nintendo games, they hold their value, they are good.
The last window thing is quite cursed, buying like a bought version, but then if you play it on DS, it's probably better to play these games on DS. I always think they look a little soft on 3DS games. So yeah, I've not really got a problem with that.
I think this is okay as a collection of games, like the idea of buying a console after the fact and then hoovering up all the cool stuff so you get to play 5, 9 out of 10s all at once. That's one of the great pleasures of coming to a console late. And I can't really deny someone that pleasure.
It's not like he bought, you know, a ridiculous 600 quid Zelda 3DS or some arse like that. So yeah, I think this is alright.
Yeah, another lukewarm not guilty and no one gets sent down to the reservoir. Livid Matthew, furious. Okay, this next one's got a couple of slightly spicier entries.
I don't know, they could be spicier to be honest. But there is like definitely one big ding ding ding red flag for Matthew Castle. Exhibit F, hi there big men, for sentencing purposes, anything without a specific note has been inflated.
Prices around the nearest half pound from Australian dollars and have included purchase year. Fuck me. This isn't like your fucking end of year HMRC statement.
I don't need all this detail. Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, cart only, £8.2022. Automatic guilty, surely Matthew.
Hades, Switch, Box, £35 in 2022. That was a gift. That's weird.
Don't put gifts in here. You have to actually own the thing yourself.
You can't keep doing that.
I feel like he's put in Hades to balance out fucking Sonic. That's what I think he's done there. Hotel Dusk, Room 215, DS, cart only £15 in 2022.
Mario Odyssey Switch, cart only £24 in 2024. When these people read these things out, Matthew, I'm like, are we running a cult? Are all these people buying the games that you love?
Is this a cult that we've got going on? I think it might be, but anyway.
It's a very weird cult. Imagine signing up to a cult where the cult leaders are regularly saying, this cult's terrible, this is awful, I can't believe anyone likes this cult.
It's just weird because Hotel Dusk has come up so many times in Games Court. Like, we've definitely sold more copies of that game than any other game. I'm waiting now for the promised mascot agency Backlash that comes from our optimism for that game.
That's definitely in the posts for us, I think. A few more purchases here. Silverfall PC £1.50 in 2024, unplayed.
Don't know what that is, mate. Battle for Metal at Middle Earth 2 PC £4 in 2022. Will that even run on a PC now?
Anyway, Mechwarrior 4 Mercenaries PC Big Box £5 in 2018 or so. Couldn't get work on my PC. Couldn't even play it through other means with an older boy's advice.
Will have to be satisfied with memories of my friend Andrew letting me watch him play at his house as a kid. Best wishes, craft cheese. So let's disregard Hades there, Matthew.
We basically got Hotel Dusk, Mario Odyssey, Sonic Chronicles, and a load of PC games you don't give a shit about anyway. Is the man dead or not?
I just looked up Silverfall and I would not want that game box in my house. Like, some very generic busty Elfin Woman. And it got 5.5 from IGN, which is not a good sign.
I mean, Sonic Dark Brotherhood. Like, if there exist games that get you an instant pass, which is awkward because Mario Odyssey is one of those games and in this collection, there are also the kind of, like, disastrous sort of insta-death games. And I'd say Sonic Dark Brotherhood is one of them.
Yeah, just an incredibly cursed thing. What if Bioware, yes, that Bioware made a Sonic RPG, which takes, like, the most heinous element of Sonic, which is all his shitty friends and their fictional world, and puts that front and centre and goes, well, he won't do any of the speedy stuff. He'll do lots of talking with his friends and you're like, obviously not.
Oh, can I tell a quick story about that game, by the way?
Yeah.
Because when I first played it, there's like a few different worlds you go to early on. And I was actually, I was kind of into it. We talked about the cursed music before in Sonic Dark Brotherhood, which is a Bioware RPG, of course.
And I was, I thought the game was about to end. And then it was like, oh, and here's like some massive alien worlds for you to go explore. And my genuine horror that hadn't ended was like palpable.
I was on a holiday in Spain and it's like my main game on the holiday. And I was like, oh, I was so psychologically ready for this, to be over and then realized by being challenged to play much more of it than I realized that I actually did not like the game one bit. And so that was my my journey with that game, Matthew.
So did you romance Big the Cat?
Was sadly, sadly not an option. I mean, do you remember the Fox News report about when they showed Big the Cat's arse in that game, how controversial that was? That was a reference to a Mass Effect thing.
Anyway, carry on, Matthew.
Oh, right. Oh, my God. Sorry.
It's hot in this sauna.
It's not.
It's not. Jokes can go over my head.
It's fine. Carry on anyway.
Yeah, I'd say so Sonic Cat cancels out Super Mario Odyssey. So it's back to like neutral. I really have you seen this silver full box art?
It's just it's very tacky looking. I feel like that's that's like Insta Kill number two.
It's got big Sudecky energy. Remember that game? Just sort of horned up NAF kind of like Western RPG vibes with a bit of sexiness, but not in any way convincing.
The big question mark here. Well, there are several games I've not played here obviously, but I don't really know anything about MechWarrior. Like I don't really have any reading on whether it's good, bad, which ones are good, which ones are bad.
Is it a series that whichever one you get that it's kind of okay? It's just not something I have any interest in. So that one's difficult.
All right, so let's call it overall Matthew. Are we saying death for this one?
Yeah, let's say death, but again, if MechWarrior is good then...
No, I feel like it's... I always think of MechWarrior as an American concern. Do you know what I mean?
Well, that's one of those games that, like... PC Gamer US would give 98% and PC Gamer UK would give, like, 75%. That's what MechWarrior is to me.
If it doesn't come with a plastic controller replicating the MechCop pig's hips up, at least two bedroom cupboards, I'm not interested.
OK, good. Well, we have a guilty verdict there. A little bonus from CraftCheese who sent that in, Matthew.
This got more emoji reacts in the Discord than the, no offence, slightly milk toast, Games Court entry there. So I'm just going to read out this, what is called a cold case in bold capital letters, Matthew. I spent a lot of time in my wealthier cousin's place in the 2000s.
They had a new GameCube and PS2 while me and my sis shared a second hand N64 and Game Boy Color. Because they got the newest consoles and games when they came out, they had a lot of old games too. They overflowed from their home office drawers and none drew my eye more than The Legend of Zelda Oracle of Seasons.
The only Zelda I had at home was Majora's Mask and stories of others from Mags and the boys at school. The little see-through plastic cartridge of Oracle of Seasons promised more Zelda and it sat untouched. They never played it, so surely came the thought, they wouldn't miss it.
Primary school meet agonized over it. They're family! Stealing is wrong!
But what if the victim never plays the thing and also owns Wind Waker and Final Fantasy X? So one night, I slipped away from a family gathering and pocketed the cartridge. I snuck Oracle of Seasons home, where it belonged, with me, who really appreciated Zelda and I loved it.
But the guilt ate away at me. That's school holidays. I hid the game at the back of my little Game Boy carry case when it wasn't in use, dreading a, where did you get that new game from my parents, who in reality would never have noticed?
And that it would swiftly be taken back to its legal owner. Maybe the police would be involved, who knew? So I made up a lie.
My dad lived in a newly built mobile home. I'd say that I'd found it in the cupboard and a builder must have left it here. Maybe it slipped out of a pocket while they were building, and it would be a shame for it to go to waste and I have a Game Boy Color.
My dad seemed more confused as to why I told him than anything. I can't remember what his exact response was. But I got to complete the game, so I got to keep the game and I was no longer paranoid that it would be sent to Supermax.
Not sure what the Statute of Limitations is on this one, or whether you have jurisdiction over Australia and Castle Island, but thanks for reading. That's again from Craft Cheese. I think much more enjoyable than the Games Court entry Matthew Thoughts.
Yeah, I like that a lot. I've got this image of an LA. Noire style scene of someone looking at a child's face, a finger hovering over the doubt button as they try and say that a builder left Oracle of Seasons in a caravan.
Yeah, amazing.
It's just so unlikely.
It is. But I will admit that I'm also imagining it in the accent of that little Australian boy in Bart vs Australia, the Simpsons episode. Yes, there they go, the till's going clockwise, that little kid.
I'm imagining him saying it in that voice. Is it, look dad, a friendly Oracle of Seasons dad, or something like that. Just a very cursed fake Australian accent.
Okay, good. I'm starting to appreciate this. You know like how we had the big telly story last time we did Games Court.
I feel like send in your anecdotes that are Games Court adjacent where you think they might give us a chuckle, because I think they might actually be more exciting than some of the entries. That's a little open invitation there to the listeners, Matthew.
Yeah, it's a bit more exciting than is Mario Odyssey good or bad.
When you put it like that, it's quite a flawed notion to build a podcast.
It's our fault for doing it.
It's on us.
Where are we going to put him in the mansion? For that story… What about the vault?
Yeah, I quite like that.
That's the closest thing to a prison cell. We could lock him in the vault.
What if he just gets to have the foundations but not the actual vault bit? He's just fucking stuck there. He's basically got that little lift.
That's all he can do. You just walk past him whenever you're on your way into a different room but he can't leave.
You're like, that's that kid that stole that Oracle of Seasons.
Yeah, he's going down to the entrance to the vault to see if they've got a little upgrade disk there but it never fucking respawns, does it? Because this game is very, very stingy. He's just going back and forth on the lift, Matthew.
There's some blueprints isn't on trial here. Yes, okay, agreed, that's fine.
Okay, Foundations then, Enjoy, which is placed in a very inconvenient part of the Judge Castle's house basically, so that's good.
Yeah, it's far from the front door, it's like rank 8.
Exhibit G, I didn't get your name here so I apologize for that. I don't know who I'm defending or who I'm sending to death, but I'm not going back into the Discord to find out, so I'll just read the entry. When I was about nine years old, I bought an unboxed copy of The Lion King for the Mega Drive from a second-hand shop in Hendon called Retro Bloke.
It was priced at three pounds when I handed over my five-pound note, the shopkeeper just took it and smiled at me as though the transaction was complete. Even at that age, I was already too terminally English to correct his mistake and ask for my change, and instead chose to allow this incident along with every other time I've done something stupid or failed to stand up for myself to take root in my head and remain there long after all kinds of much happier childhood memories have faded. I have outlived Retro Bloke, which is now a bright pink building that sells bespoke cakes, but the victory feels hollow.
When I was about 23, I attempted to buy a copy of God of War for the PS2 from Game Focus, the second-hand game shop on Gooch Street. The cashier pointed out that it was a US copy and asked if I had a US console. I did not.
I put it back and got a UK version of the shelf instead. I paid a combined total of £10 for the game and for the lifelong memory of having been too much of an idiot to even check the region of a game before buying it. However, having kindly steered me away from buying a useless region-locked PS2 game, the cashier failed to warn me that I was in the gruelling first year of my career as a barrister and would probably need to spend all of my time focusing on that instead of playing God of War on the PS2.
In the event I played the game for about 15 minutes before getting stressed out about work, putting it away and never touching it again, I have outlived Game Focus which is now a bubble tea shop called Mubu but the victory feels unearned. Number 3, Nintendo Alamo 8999.
I can't wait to hear what shop he f***ing outlasted in this one.
Sorry, what did you say? Alamo isn't a game so it's not eligible for Games Court which is about games and not household appliances? Well thank goodness there's one podcast willing to stand up to James Farley's bulls***.
That doesn't count here, there are no other podcasts Matthew. There is no James Farley as far as I'm aware, especially not on Castle Island. Okay, so we've got Alamo and two things that happened ages ago.
I mean, I think Alamo is really a thing on trial here. The first anecdote about handing over £5 and getting no change because you're a little kid, great stuff, really enjoyed that. Second anecdote, I was confused because of the way it was written, I'll be honest with you.
And Alamo, I mean, I think Alamo was kind of bad. How are you getting on with Alamo these days Matthew?
We don't have it in the bedroom because you have to get out of bed and move for it to stop being Alamo. And we wake up at slightly different times. So the idea of having something that gets really cross of both of us out of bed is hugely inconvenient.
Catherine uses it to tell her when it's the end of the day, she has it on her desk just to go off and say like down tools and stop working. But occasionally, well I say occasionally, every time Catherine is away, she forgets to turn it off and it starts going mental when I'm at home by myself, and it scares the shit out of me. I think there's some kind of mad ghost or the cat's done something terrible upstairs, and I have to rush up and it's just sort of a cacophony of like Mario noises.
So yeah, it's incredibly cursed.
Yeah, okay, good. So, I don't know, one good anecdote to buying Alamo. How does it come out in the wash, Matthew?
Yeah, I don't know. It felt like the second anecdote was just sort of like a humble brag that they're trying to be a barrister.
Yeah, it didn't say though that they'd passed or like became a barrister.
Oh, interesting.
So, but if you'd have posted it at the end of it.
And that's coming from a lawyer himself.
Yeah, exactly. And as everyone knows, I got my degree from the Ace Attorney trilogy. So, that's where mine comes from.
That is your school on Castle Island.
And so, yeah, I mean, if you'd have ended this anecdote in saying, yeah, but I write to you about God of War from a branch of Greggs in Blackburn, I'd be like, oh man, what a like a Black Mirror style ending to this. Not that there's any shame in making a living, however you do it. But barrister to Greggs is the kind of like thing that would psychologically break a man, isn't it?
That kind of downgrade. So no further information there on the man's career path, Matthew, but what do you want to call it? Guilty or not guilty?
Yeah, let's say guilty, Alamo fucking sucks, doesn't it?
It does. Which of the rooms in Blueprints will this one be going to? What's the room with the fucking little like power thing and the you got a mess of the switches?
I fucking hate that little room.
Oh, the lab? Oh no, you mean the breaker?
Yeah, the breaker room. They're just in there with that little switch and the fucking nothing else. Should we put them in there?
Yeah, okay, why not?
You can have your alarm-o, though. You can, yeah, that'll be a little treat for you. Okay, exhibit H.
In response to the segment at the end of today's episode, God knows when this fucking came up, where Matthew requests Facebook marketplace anecdotes.
Oh yeah.
I went through a phase, I think this is actually the last Games Court, I went through a phase of buying the cheapest games I could find on there. More for the characters I'd meet along the way than the actual games.
That sounds bad.
This is from Martin. A few highlights. Five pound for Zelda Tri Force Heroes from a uni student who asked if I could collect any earlier as she needed the cash to pay for food.
Oh, that's Black Mirror.
Yeah, felt especially bad as I paid in one pound coins. What are you fucking 65 years old? There's my fucking nan out here buying Zelda Tri Force Heroes.
Your five pounds jangling in your pocket.
Who carries coins after COVID? That's so confusing. Five pound for Star Fox 64 3D.
Youngish couple who asked me, are you here to collect Lilac Wars with a pair of Rice Miles? When I said yes, they left me alone in their kitchen for at least ten minutes before eventually returning with the game and then quizzing me on general Nintendo trivia. I've got two theories here Matthew, swingers or serial killers?
There's no in-between, it has to be one or the other. Yeah, both. Three pounds for WePlay Motion from an older woman.
Swingers, rice, while as they say, Lilac Wars. That's code in our community.
Yeah, when I say Fox McCloud, drop your trousers. Sorry about that. Three pound for WePlay Motion from an older woman.
No further information on what that entails. As I was walking to the car, she called me back to say, I almost forgot it came with a controller and handed me a pristine red Wii Remote Plus. Still feel a bit guilty for not offering her a bit more.
That is a good little get there. Fifteen pounds for a PS2 Slim, controller, memory card and a load of games, including Off the Top of My Head, GTA Liberty and Vice City Stories, The Getaway and its sequel, The Simpsons Game and Hit and Run, and a couple of Spyro and Rayman games. Came in a JD Sports van from a very rough household where I questioned whether I was going to make it out of there alive.
This was a store that broke the camel's back, and I retired not only from Marketplace, but Facebook itself. So yeah, those are the stories, Matthew. I assume that he also left his swinging days behind after that.
So yeah, insisting you dress like fucking, what's this job, Slippy Toad.
A bit of the old Slippy Toad, eh?
Wear this and we're going to tie you up. Okay. So I thought some great little anecdotes there, Matthew.
And Allin only spent, I think, 28 pounds for quite a lot of good stuff.
It's a pretty good value for money and you got to meet some interesting people. Yeah. Did you say the last one was in a van or in a house?
In a very rough household.
Okay. And he went into the house. That's the thing.
I don't know if I'd ever go into someone's house.
No, I always insist on meeting at a neutral location like a car park or something.
Outside, I'd be like, throw it to me from the doorway and I'll stand like meters away from it. Just don't ever go into a stranger's house. Really bad vibes.
Now I feel a bit bad about asking people to do silly things on Facebook Marketplace just for our pleasure.
Yeah, but after the first one, he could have noped out. It was going pretty well until he got to the last one, I would say. The Wiimote Remote Plus thing is a real winner here.
I remember looking up for a few of these a few years ago when I was doing some Back Page pod nonsense. And I think it was quite pricey to get the actual dongle or have the dongle built in or something like that. It was not as cheap as just buying a Wiimote.
Yeah, no, it was a pain in the ass. And the ones that they released which had it built in, that was the way to do it. And the game's not much cop.
It's good value for what it is. I'm still just thrown by the 10 minutes waiting in someone's house while they vanish. That's like that episode of Atlanta where they go to get the piano.
Oh, what an episode that is. I was thinking about that in the day.
Oh, it's a killer episode, but if I got left in someone's house for a long period of time, that's where my mind would go.
What do you think that a man in some kind of weird face mask carapace thing looking like Michael Jackson would turn up and go, I've got your copy of Star Fox 64 3D.
I'd assume I'm being fucked with in some horrible way, for sure. If I was left for 10 minutes in a room, I'd be like, oh, this is bad. Especially two people.
Two people have to go and get a game case. No, this doesn't add up at all. I'm going to say not guilty, but I am also going to say, please don't go to dangerous places for a funny story.
We'd never know if it went wrong, I guess.
We wouldn't hear from you, would we? That would be it. If your direct debit on Patreon just lapses one day, I guess that will be a clue for us.
Every time I read a story in the news about something terrible going down in a house, I'm going to wonder, what if they listened to the podcast and that was because of us, which is quite a heavy burden to shoulder.
Well, yeah. And then like on BBC News it says, and they found the only thing on the crime scene was a copy of Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 on PS3 or something. That would be...
For 350.
Yeah. OK. I think that's a firm not guilty.
But that's not guilty as it gets. £15 for a PS2 sim. I admire your hustle there, Martin.
There's some good stuff in there. And Triforce Heroes, which is in that bracket of slightly cursed Latter Day 3DS software we talked about, Matthew, on a previous episode. We were like, what the heck was going on in the last few years of the 3DS?
Quite a confusing little time for Nintendo there. Exhibit I. When my dad passed away, I agreed to help my technophobic mother clear out his computer room and found a very eroded Sainsbury's Bank for life containing my brother's old Uni PS3, which he didn't want.
Happy to try out some games that have been favourably mentioned on the pod in the past. I agreed to take it on and later hit up CX Birmingham and eBay to get some games for it. An extremely scratched copy of FIFA not being my speed.
The eBay hole is alright, but it's quite a boring good selection. He's right Matthew. IMO was at the end of the last sentence.
The formatting on when you copy and paste things on Discord is a fucking nightmare. All Out New Vegas £1.49. Uncharted Drake's Fortune £1.99.
Uncharted 2 Among Thieves £1.99. Uncharted 3 Drake's Deception £1.99. GTA 5 No Map £2.99.
GTA 5 on PS3 in the modern age. What a time to be alive. Unfortunately in CX I decided to buy Skyrim again despite already owning it on Steam PC and for some reason buying it full price on Switch with all the buggy, unpatched misery.
That was £15 Skyrim. I played none of the above and to rub salt into the wound I've used the PS3 once since to watch the 3rd Hobbit movie on Blu-ray which I've owned for years and never watched. So you didn't play fucking Uncharted 2 but you did watch that piece of shit 3rd Hobbit movie.
5 Armies or whatever it is.
Oh that film is at a toilet that film. So bad. Seems like opening shot Matthew.
I didn't know again who the listener was here because I'm a good podcaster who's good at his job but yeah.
The Games and the prices. Absolutely great collection of games for like sub £20. This would have absolutely been not guilty but you didn't play any of them.
So the whole thing was pointless. Yeah, I like just very poor. I'm not going to go too heavy because the start of the story was sad.
So, you know, sorry about that. But just play these games. Just play your damn games.
I'll put you in a nice room in the Blueprints Mansion. The boudoir.
That's a great little room that, you know, cracking, relaxing, nice, not too bad. That was from Nathan Redland, by the way. Thank you for your letter, Nathan.
Thank you, Nathan.
It is from Alec Drew. Wanted to rebuy some of the childhood big box PC games I grew up with. I'll always have fond memories of a detailed game booklet or tech tree.
Still miss having a read or waiting for something to install. Warcraft 2, £48. Close Combat 3, £8.
Sim City 3000, £22. Baldur's Gate, £8.50. Pharaoh, £30.
Age of Empires 2, £43. Dungeon Keeper, £30. Dungeon Keeper 2, £20.
Command and Conquer Red Alert, £30. There is a picture in close, Matthew, which the listeners can't see, but I will indeed share with you into the Discord, so you can just see what we're dealing with. They all look very nice and very nice condition.
Honestly, lovely, doesn't it?
Oh yeah, the plastic boxes.
Look what they took from us. How fucking good were big box PC games? They looked amazing, but I guess millennials don't tend to own property do they?
So I guess we can't have them anymore. But those plastic DVD cases were so shit, man. What an absolute fucking generational downgrade that was for all involved.
Some high prices here, but I think there's some good taste in rounding these up. I can't speak for fair. I think it was a pretty well regarded game, but all those other games were very, very well liked.
These are some all-time PC classics in there. Of those, I imagine, Baldur's Gate and SimCity were things that you played at the time?
Not SimCity, but Baldur's Gate, yes. I mean, yeah, I'm going to have to ask you to sort of step out of your role as lawyer and just join me. Well, I'm not up on a stand or anything.
Like shuffle along the sauna bench so you're closer to me. It's not weird. And just turn to me straight.
As a former editor of PC Gamer, what's your vibe check here?
Yeah, the condition of the boxes makes this okay to me. The Warcraft 2 is the one where I'm like, I was never much of a Blizzard guy, so I have to kind of take their word for it on that. And Close Combat 3 can't really vouch for that.
But SimCity 3000, really solid, nice looking city builder from the time when EA was on top of this and before they fucking torched that entire franchise down. Well done to John Riccatello for that. One of his many triumphs.
Baldur's Gate, 850 seems like a good deal to me. Obviously, did that come with the cloth map? I don't know, Matthew, but it was certainly of that era.
Yeah, I feel like it did.
I can't remember if the Red Luck came with a tech tree or just a manual that had all the different units in it, but I actually had the really big box for this, which is like the size of two big box PC games put together in it. The little jewel case would just slide around in this unnecessarily sized box, basically. Utterly impractical.
Age of Empires II, an absolute classic. £43 is dear for a game that you can play on Game Pass with a much shinier version, but that's not really the exercise here. I would imagine...
I think this did come with a poster that had all the different eras in it and the different upgrades in it. So, Dungeon Keeper II, again, like a classic of the time. I think this is pretty solid.
And for a little personal indulgence, these have been kept very nicely on a shelf. I think that's all right, Matthew. So that's my take as former PC gamer at EIC.
Awesome. Now, you can slide back down next to Hagrid.
Not too close, though.
Yeah, not too close. I'm going to say not guilty.
Okay, excellent. All right, then. Okay, so we are getting there.
I should get you to do both halves of Games Court more often. It's fantastic.
You just don't even appear on the podcast anymore.
I just sit here and be like, mm-hmm, I'll just make a soundboard.
You just have the week off, basically. Exhibit K is from ThrillX. I reckon a lot of us have bought a terrible meme game at some point just for the laughs.
I know Samuel has. It's pretty much the progenitor of Games Court. I've got a working Japanese PS1 and on a trip to the Glasgow gaming market with a friend last year, I'd sold a bunch of older games and amassed a few hundred quid to Spaff.
Spaff is not my choice of word, just to be clear. As a result, I wanted to come home with one extravagant purchase. The Japanese PS1 dictated that said purchase would, for some reason, be Pepsi Man, the Japan-only Pepsi-sponsored runner game that intersperses its gameplay with FMV clips of a fat American man drinking Pepsi.
I bought it for £130. You can see it in the picture among loads of other games you're free to judge me on if you can be asked. The man at the store even apologized for the price without offering to lower it.
I told some workmates about it when I got back and it basically became a measuring stick for stupid prolificacy in my office. I can't believe you're spending £430 to own a Tesla. Good point, mate.
I suppose I could have bought three copies of Pepsi Man with that, eh? Wow, what a burn. And so on.
I played it with one of those workmates and it's not even terrible. It's just boring and difficult. I sold it on eBay at a loss of £10 and basically any and all cred I had at work.
Well, I guess that is the greater loss. Yeah, the picture enclosed, Matthew, is, I mean, it's a picture of, indeed, like the quite nice box art of Pepsi Man. Next to Scarface, The World Is Yours, Amps on Xbox, Dead or Alive Ultimate, Time Shift, which was really not very good, Half-Life 2 kind of rip off, Sopranos, Road to Respect, which is obviously a travesty, and Cold Fear, a game I think has come up on this podcast before, and Death by Degrees, a notorious Tekken-themed stinker on PS2 third-person game, Nina, a spin-off that did not quite take, and The Suffering, of course, a Midway classic.
So, you know, Pepsi Man, I think over £100 is too much for a meme game personally, but what do you think?
Yeah, I just don't think you should be buying meme games full stop. The idea of like an ironic purchase, I mean, come on, that just seems so wasteful. Knowing that you're throwing away money.
That's it. I did look up Pepsi Man. And the thing that jumped out to me is that the 3D models in the game were apparently created by Zero Escape creator Kotaro Chikoshi before he was a game director.
He was a character modeler on Pepsi Man. So there is a connection to a Castle favorite. So without Pepsi Man, there's no Zero Escape.
Thank you for the tenuous connection. I appreciate it.
Yes. No, I'm sorry. I just don't really believe in this kind of stuff.
Like it may have seemed like mega lols at the moment. But I don't know, 130 quid, you could buy so many actual good games that you want to play. No.
I feel like games go-
Let this be a warning to future meme people, future meme purchases.
Do you think what my ultimate meme purchase was? I mean, you could argue that Steel Battalion was.
But Steel Battalion, it isn't a meme purchase, but it's also-
It's a Capcom game.
It is an interesting thing that you want to play, and it has this very interesting controller. It's true, one of a kind. It's just like, you know, some fucking cool spot shit.
Yeah. It's like buying the- It's like the fucking-
What's the Doritos game on Xbox? Similar sort of bracket that has happened to it.
Yeah. Doritos Dat- Not Dash, is it?
It's like a Doritos Universe, I don't know, something like that. Anyway.
Or there's the Burger King one, is it Sneaking?
Oh yeah, yeah. And there's probably more. Is there a Smarties game?
I think there is. Anyway. Yeah.
I mean, the only thing where you could get away with it is if you do like a wry two-hour long video essay about Pepsi Man, because that's the kind of stuff people like on YouTube, isn't it?
Yeah, that is true. And then people are just like, it gets like 500,000 views and the comments are like, he's fucking done Pepsi Man.
He's got a seven-hour retrospective on the Doritos game. I know how I'm spending my weekend. Yeah, I'm spending my weekend getting the fuck away from YouTube.
Oh, that's, I know exactly the kind of thing you're alluding to there. And oh my god, I'm totally with you, man. Everything, everything, all the games content we do is, can be consumed between fucking other tasks.
The idea of sitting down to watch the Pepsi Man retrospective is a hard note from me, dog.
I can't believe we're getting cross about imagined for DLSA.
But it's not imagined, is it, Matthew? You're alluding to something quite real. Yeah, okay.
So, I agree, guilty. Let's move on. Yeah, I don't think I've made many mean purchases, though, otherwise.
I did buy some slightly dodgy DS games, but this was back during Cozzy Lives when you couldn't go anywhere. This is before, sorry, before Cozzy Lives during COVID, where you couldn't go anywhere, and before DS prices, game prices really kind of exploded. Now I don't really indulge in the market as much, you know.
Now I'm just buying like Nintendo Switch games before Nintendo finds a way to charge me like 40 pounds extra for them on Switch 2. Yeah, that's true. That's why I now own Xenoblade Chronicles X, Matthew.
But that's a story for another day.
I'm putting this person in the chapel because a fool in his money easily parted as is the chapel's entire vibe, so.
But yeah, you have to walk back and forth in and out of the chapel into a different room.
Yeah, a hundred and thirty times till you've wasted as much money as you'd have wasted on Pepsi, man.
While your colleagues laugh at you from behind the stained glass in the chapel.
OK, you're looking at a screenshot going, how does he get 130 coins in blueprints? He must be cheating. And you're calling the cheater on Discord.
My proudest moment, Matthew, is leading to there. OK, Exhibit L on to other Samuel Roberts related shame, I guess. O and E 567 submits this one, Matthew.
Crash Bandicoot Action Pack bought because my old copy of Tag Team Racing crashes when you reach the second world of the campaign. Fucking campaign.
Small mercies.
20 pounds.
You're always laughing at the concept of campaigns in racing games. That's a real thing.
No, it is. But you know when they just say campaign and it's just driving and you're fucking racing against Wario or whatever.
No, I'm with him on that. That's OK to call them campaigns.
Campaign. Yeah, that's fine. That's 20 pounds that one.
I'm just going to look up exactly what Crash Bandicoot Action Collection is actually because I don't know exactly what that is. Oh, OK. I think it's actually the PS2 Crash games, which were all dog shit, weren't they?
It says Crash Nitro Kart in there. There's multiple Crash, Twin Sanity and Tag Team Racing with the three games on there. Good Lord.
What a load of old shit that was. I mean, Crash games on PS2. Everyone knew they were stinky.
You played Jack and Daxter instead if you had taste. The Crash games were for children who were just, you know, for parents who just didn't know what to buy them for Christmas. OK, some slightly better games here, Matthew.
GT3, Vice City and San Andreas. Three, five and six pound respectively. Played Vice City before when I was about ten.
Oblivious Grandparents, a car boot sale or a godsend. But I haven't played San Andreas. Currently playing through Tag Team Racing and enjoying it.
Oh, they kind of cancel each other out a little bit. But I couldn't imagine playing like PS2, GTAs now. I haven't played the definitive editions.
I need those quality of life updates, Matthew. Those improvements couldn't go back myself. But what do you make of this?
No, three things I quite like absolutely cancel out by three things. I got no interest in whatsoever. Bad.
Bad.
Yeah, that sucks. I know there are some people who swear by, well, they swear by the other Crash Racing, right? They like Crash Team Racing.
That's the one people like. But I played that Our Office Christmas Party and I didn't think it was very good. I thought it was very five out of ten.
And I'd eaten so many sweets at that Christmas Party. That if ever I was going to enjoy a game, it would have been then. So if that can cancel out the sugar high of like five bags of Haribo, then it's got to be some pretty potent shit.
Yeah, no, bad. Guilty.
Yeah, OK. Good. Which room are they going in?
Can I suggest they get the pump room, but they don't have access to the toilet. So they're just shitting in the pump room. It's not ideal for them.
But yeah, that's that's my pitch, Matthew. But there's also the kennel could put them there. That's that would be great.
The only my only concern with leaving them in the pump room is that they could like mess up the flow of the rest of the house constantly fiddling with levers that they don't really understand. They could drown us in this order guide.
Yeah, that's it. They could drown us in this order, which would be good, would it?
All right. That's that's yeah. I don't want every day going, what's the maniac in the pump room done today?
Out with revenge, because I didn't like crash tag team racing.
Freezer would be good. Pop them in the freezer.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
Brilliant. Okay, great. God, Crash Bandicoot action pack.
They may be so depressed looking at that. Games I literally didn't know existed because I thought-
You know what I really like? The PS2 era crash game.
Yeah. All-time stinkeroonies, surely. Exhibit M.
Friday the 13th for the ZX Spectrum for 50 pounds. I think I'm a goner. The back of the cassette for this, Matthew, which I recommend looking up, is just so fucking paired down, so unimpressive.
It's kind of amazing. However, to balance this, purchase two. Crash Bandicoot N.
Sane Trilogy for PS4. 50 goddamn pence from an old lady at a local dog shelter charity do. Not sure how the judge will take this, but I advise I only had a pound coin.
What's the pound coins in this episode? Said it was fine when she tried to offer me 50p change. I await my likely execution.
That's on General Shite Meister. Sounds laid up. This was submitted.
What a sign off.
I'm not making these Games Court entries up now. Friday the 13th, the ZX Spectrum is the interesting one. I do think it's a bit bleak to deprive a charity of 50p.
Those dogs could use your extra 50p in my opinion, but Matthew doesn't like dogs, so that might count in your favor, to be honest. What do you think, Matthew?
This is literally before my time. I find judging these things, because you sometimes play these things on little online emulators or whatever, and I find it's like going too far back. It's just not for me.
And I realize that's like saying, oh, I don't like Shakespeare, it's too old, but I do like modern plays. You know, it's... I think you can appreciate the importance of something happening, but also want nothing the fuck to do with it, which is kind of how I feel about that.
I just think you had to be there. I just don't think you can go back.
Yeah. It looks so astonishingly shit in screenshot form, and I know it's pared down because that was the technology for the time, but still, good lord. Yeah.
The other 50 quid on this, that's tough.
That's the idea. That's what a horror game is in this era. Yeah.
This little man in a bright green field.
With what looks like a chainsaw in a very vague way, but could be farming equipment, you know?
Yeah. Oh dear. No.
Okay, so guilty. I think so. I'm sorry.
I don't know if this was important, but no.
Darren Jones, if you're listening to this, can you let us know if this was a good call by Matthew? Because we don't understand Games Assault as it's been made clear.
Maybe there's an episode stepping away from Castle Island, going back into the elevator very briefly. Maybe there is an episode where we just try and appreciate a different generation of games.
Are we still in the Blueprints Mansion? Is this the elevator in the Blueprints Mansion?
We've gone in the elevator up to Earth.
Right. Okay, good. I see.
I'm just saying we could do that. Because I know we have some slightly older than us listeners who this stuff is really important to. And I bet they cringe when they hear me go, Oh, it just looks so fucking old.
I've got a good feeling about Friday the 13th and the ZX Spectrum not being an all-time classic. Yeah.
Yeah. I just... I feel safe.
Like, if anyone wants to get right in with suggestions of how to approach this platform in a way that won't, you know, scare me off, please do let me know. Because I just never know how to... I just can't do it.
Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, write into PO Box and give us a stamped address envelope. Write in, because the year is 1995.
Please do that.
Email in. We have an email address.
We do. backpagegames.gmail.com. If we are wrong about Friday the 13th on ZX Spectrum or Viennese 13th, this just came up when I was Googling it.
Just now I see that's the Spanish version. Please write in. Thank you for your entry, though, Gerald Scheitmeister.
We've got a lot of personality in there. It was a brief anecdote, but it told us everything. Deprived a woman of 50p.
Great stuff.
We're back in the elevator. We're back in Blueprints Mansion.
Okay, good. Toilet fix, yeah? I don't know.
Anyway, Exhibit N is from Russell. We have a few entries here from the e-mail, which I'll admit to having been slow at harvesting these over the last few Games Court. So I want to end with a few of these, Matthew.
In 2023, I purchased a PlayStation Classic Mini, secured through auction on eBay. I already owned one, but for an auction price of £10 plus £6.85 postage and packaging. I thought that having a backup machine at this price is a good purchase.
It was unboxed and without cables or controller. But as I already owned one complete with these, I didn't see it as an issue for the price. What I received upon winning the auction, however, was the original PS1 console, which had been photographed on a very large tablecloth, picture attached.
I'll find this picture and drop it into the Discord for you, Matthew. While I had owned the cables for a PlayStation Classic, I didn't own them for a PS1, and as such, was unable to test if the console worked or not. Although not advertised in the eBay listing, the package also included an official Sony PS1 controller with see-through clear case, that seems all right, a Mega Drive controller, brackets that I don't own a Mega Drive to be able to test if it works, the case and manual for PS5 for the PS2, for the game inside is actually PS4.
I didn't own a PS2 to be able to test the game, a burnt copy of UA for Champions League for the PS1. I could have tried to return the package, but for £10, I didn't feel like it was worth the effort. Did I get my money's worth or did I just pay someone to help them clear out their loft?
Regards, Russell. Quite a fun entry there, Matthew. I enjoyed that.
What do you think of the... I will find this picture for you, but what are your brief thoughts in the meantime?
I mean, it really does sound like someone clearing out their attic, I'm afraid. That's such a random collection of things. It is funny and I would have laughed opening it at the state of what I'd had.
The question is, did you get £10 worth of laughs?
They did call it a mini console in the thing as well. That seems a bit fucking rude, I think. At that point, you kind of did lie about what the thing is.
The thing is, what you bought and what you got were different things. Buying a mini console for a tenner, that's okay. If you want to have that mini console and play the whatever 20 games on it, that's fine.
I've not got a problem with that. That they sent you a load of random shit, that doesn't feel like it's on you. So I think that's not guilty.
Okay, good. All right. Well, I enjoyed that story, Russell.
I will say, I do disagree with your assertion that the tablecloth was very big and made the PS1 look mini. I don't think that's true at all, Matthew. I think that's just a normal tablecloth myself, but I did enjoy that as a defense anyway.
So that's good.
That's a tablecloth massive.
Also, it's clearly not a PlayStation Mini in the photo. Like it clearly to me looks like quite a worn down PS1, but anyway.
The Mini looks, that is what a Mini looks like. Yeah. It looks like a PlayStation One.
I mean, there's, I mean, what? That thing is ripe for scamming, isn't it?
It is really. Maybe you are right. Maybe that is a big tablecloth.
Anyway, I will, if you want this, I'll put it in the Patreon post, so you can see what some of these things look like. It might be, might be fun for about two listeners to enjoy.
I like the idea of a criminal case in a court that hinges on whether or not the jury think a tablecloth was big or not. It's got a bit of like, if the glove fits, a quick energy to it.
Yeah, the stakes are exactly the same and the crimes, they're exactly the same.
No, obviously not, but it has a bit of that. That's where I'm just, you know, just explaining where my brain went.
This next entry is interesting. It's a year old, Matthew. Yes, I've been slow clearing out the mailboxes.
And it's from PC Gamer's Ted Litchfield, who is one of my favorite PC Gamer writers. I think he's really, really talented. So thank you for this entry, Ted.
Gentlemen, big fan of the show, I kept meaning to write in every time there's a new Games Court episode. In 2021, I purchased a used big box copy of Neverwinter Nights, a seven out of 10 bioware RPG with nine out of 10 expansions and 10 out of 10 modding that happens to be my PC gaming first love. For quick background, here's all the times I've previously acquired Neverwinter Nights new.
2002, original release, sister's copy, now lost. 2003, expansion packs, also my sister's, also lost. 2006, Diamond Edition single DVD re-release, thought it had more new stuff than it did.
2015, Diamond Edition digital copy via GOG. 2020, Enhanced Edition Nintendo Switch physical copy. 2021, Enhanced Edition GOG.
As you can see, I'm rich in Neverwinter Nights, but I crave that old cardboard big-box experience. The big blue eye staring from the cover, the little front flap with a scene of medieval soldiers on battlements fighting off Dragon, and most crucially, the cloth map of the Sword Coast I stole from my sister and carried around with me long after I ever played the game. This was $34.73 or £25.25 at the time for big box CD-ROM copies of Neverwinter Nights original release, Diamond and Platinum editions.
I just wanted the original, but the bundle of three was cheaper than any of individual complete-in-box copies I could find. It serves as a decorative totem of my childhood in my home office as I exclusively play the GOG version whenever I revisit the game. For when society crumbles and the last undersea fiber optic cable is severed, the outriders of the gasoline neo-
I cannot pronounce this word, K-H-A-N-A-T-E will be coming to me for their Neverwinter Nights fix. What is the court's judgement best, Ted? So, lots of purchases have never went to Nights there, Matthew.
If you really love this game, I don't think this is that egregious. What's the most you've ever purchased one game across different platforms?
Maybe iterations of Ace Attorney.
Oh, right. Switch, etc.
I've got DS Switch, a digital version on 3DS. I think they did the WiiWare one episodically, and I've got a bit of that.
That's so cursed.
That's probably is.
WiiWare Phoenix Ray. Yeah.
Like four, like a load of digital copies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Probably Sonic or Sonic 2 for me, which I think I own about seven times a piece, something like that.
Oh yeah. Things that are in anthologies. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. No, it's probably Phoenix Ray, but yeah. I don't know about this one.
I think this is okay, to be honest, because you do play the game still. You don't play this particular copy of it, but it is still in use. And, you know, as we've said with the big boxes have already really given someone a pass today, because they are cool, interesting things to have.
The other things, the other versions just don't hit the same way. Like I've got Neverwinter Nights, the Switch version, and it's just, you know, it's so underpowered as a box for that. You know, it needs something giant.
I'm really curious about the bit of the email where he says he carried the map around with him, the cloth map.
Yeah.
Do you mean literally, like a hanky?
Yeah, or like a cape, you know?
I mean, A, how big was that? Like, could you fold it down? That I'm curious about.
There is maybe a little bit of, should you really have given this to your sister as you lost her big box copy of it back in the day?
She might not be bothered anymore, though. Like my dad, if I told him, oh, yeah, I've still got your copy of Civ 2 down, he doesn't care, you know?
Yeah, well, we just don't know. Uh, no, I think this is OK. It's weird, owning multiple copies is almost like a workaround for the, I haven't played it, as long as you are playing a version of it.
That seems OK.
If you're playing it over the course of two decades, I think you can justify buying many versions of it.
Yeah.
It's nice to hear you like that game so much, you know?
If we kill most of the people who write into this episode, it doesn't massively affect me on a day-to-day basis. If we kill Ted, we don't get his words on PC Gamer and that's bad.
A net loss.
He has a lot of value as a human being, is what I'm saying. So let's keep him alive.
Yeah. Okay, good. All right.
Exhibit P is from... Did I write down who this is from? It's from Jorgen Ericsson Steen Johansen, who said, you don't have to pronounce it, that's fine.
I tried anyway, Jorgen. Okay. I don't think we've run this one before.
This is a little bit of an older one too, Matthew. On a judge, members of the deranged impotent jury, questionable barrister, I submit myself to your mercy with an unorthodox case. It is unorthodox for two reasons.
One, I did not purchase this second hand. Two, it is not a game, but I feel this is a punishable offense that can only be litigated fairly in Games Court. If not, I apologize.
I already feel like I am on shaky ground, so before the honorable judge orders a summary of my execution, let me present my purchase. The Amiibo Pyra and Mithra 2-pack pre-ordered brand new for today's equivalent of 51 euros. I don't know what to say.
I don't really know what the hell I was thinking at the time. What would drive a 37-year-old father of two to buy this? This is the most unhorrendly weavy piece of shit I own, and now it lives permanently in the back of a drawer where no one must ever find it.
Let me also mention that when this arrived in the post, I opened it in front of my wife. She laughed for 15 minutes and I still think she showed great restraint in her reaction to her husband revealing himself to be a pervert. Now in my defense, laughable as it is, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is by far my favourite in the Xenoblade trilogy, and I do really like these two characters, and not just because of the bountiful boobies.
Also, when this set was announced, I read speculation that these might sell out quickly and become sought after collectibles. So I figured maybe I wanted to try and get in on that, owning a pair of treasured collectibles from one of my favourite JRPGs. And I must point out that I have opened the box, so I did not buy these for scalping purposes, as that is a detestable practice I want no part in.
Honourable Judge, Impecetic Jury, Blessed Barrister, let me tell you that these are not only still in bountiful supply nationwide and internationally, they are also slightly cheaper now than when I pre-ordered them. I subject myself to whatever judgment is deemed suitable, I regret many things. Yeah, okay, there's quite a fun entry there.
This is your whole area, Matthew. So what is the deal with Pyra and Mithra? Are these good characters to you?
Yeah, I mean, they're important characters. Certainly, they are very busty. That is true.
I mean, that's kind of like Xenoblade 2's thing, is it's sort of... Look, for a Nintendo published game, it is kind of weirdly horny. I think they are cool characters.
And if you've played the game, I can understand the thought of like, oh yeah, I'd like figures of those. They're cool. You wouldn't really think about it in terms of how fleshy they're going to be when they arrive.
Yeah, I love this. This is such a good entry.
Yeah, it's fun.
Opening in front of the wife. Having them in the back of a drawer, that's great. Like this shame thing.
Because if you open that drawer, you'd know why they've been hidden. Because they, you know, the way they look is so obvious what you're embarrassed about. It isn't technically pre-owned, which I feel like we should be quite strict on.
But I also feel like this listener has suffered enough for buying these things. And I'm glad that they shared the story. So, you know, I think I think this is it's not OK.
But it's it's not it's not too guilty an act. So net gain for the culture.
Yeah, I think we all enjoyed that. So that too is good. And I will say as well, I just had a quick Google.
These go for about 30 quid on on eBay. They are indeed in wide circulation. I mean, it kind of stopped happening at a certain point, didn't it?
I know, I don't know if they don't really care about that now. You know, it's kind of, kind of.
Yeah, I can just I can just pitch the whole thing very clearly in my mind's eye of the the oh, yeah, I like them. I'll buy that. And then what have I done?
And knowing that they're going to arrive feeling that fear, you know, like I've had that with not with busty anime figures, but you know, I've bought stuff from like, I hope Catherine doesn't see when this arrives because she might like judge me for that. Yeah, buying some of my crappy, you know, Japanese crime novels or whatever.
And you're telling me she doesn't respect the Honjin murders, Matthew, is that just not?
No, it's more like if you spend like quite a lot of money on like quite a tatty secondhand book, it looks like you, you know, you've been kind of swindled somehow. But yeah, I mean, I know that comparing getting a book through the post and getting two like busty anime ladies is quite a different proposition. Like I don't have to hide the books at the back of a drawer.
Yeah, the closest version I've got of this is my figma of Joker from Persona, which would yield the question of why do you have a toy of a teenage boy and his cat companion? Which is a great question to ask someone, I think, who you're in a relationship with. So yeah, okay, not guilty.
That's okay, listen, we've all got these secret shames.
Indeed. Okay, let's move on then. We have a not guilty verdict there.
We have three more entries left, Matthew. Exhibit Q, allow me to regale you of a short tale. A couple of years ago, I caught wind that a new Broken Sword game had somehow bypassed my awareness, having been a keep runner away from...
What the fuck is this? Sorry, the wording is confusing me. I'm just going to read it exactly as it's written, okay, listeners?
And you can try to work out what this means. Having been a keep runner away from goats in my youth, I was clearly going to have to remedy my predicament. I have no idea, okay?
I do not know.
I was the person who kept running away from goats, because there's the goat puzzle in Broken Sword 1.
Oh, God, okay. I feel like I just added aneurysm reading that. Okay, I actually found one on Facebook Marketplace quite locally for £10.
Fine. Message Seller and agreed to pick up the next day. I traveled a little over 10 miles in my car the next day while on my lunch break at work.
However, just prior to leaving, unbeknownst to me, I had received a message from the seller advising there was a wee bit of a problem. As I arrived at the home, exited my car and made my way towards the home, I was somewhat perturbed to see a seemingly rather boisterous snaffy or some such beast patrolling the fence area. The front door of the home was ajar, so I shouted, Hello?
Not being a great truster of unknown dogs patrolling a property. Thankfully, the guy heard me and came out of the house. As the door opened, I could hear a hoover running, what appeared to be a ripped up newspaper slash letter in the hall.
He apologised as he handed me the game, see images, and explained his hound was prone to getting rather excited when the post arrived, though as he and his partner had been out of the shop at the time, said doggo had lost control of all inhibitions, destroyed the post and then destroyed the game, which had been left on a low windowsill next to the door, reportedly breaking a vase in the process. Upon inspecting the item, the damage, as he can see, was considerable, but the disc appeared untouched. As such, I asked if it was still a tenner, which, Your Honour, I would have paid, purely to protect the good boy from further disgrace.
I mean, everyone gets excited when a bill falls through the door, but the fella said, nah, just take it. I said, no, said he'd had a shit enough morning as it was, minus his post, a vase and a game sale, and proposed a fiver, which he accepted and said, if it didn't work, just bring it back. I now keep this game with my collection, more as a souvenir of the day.
The Staffy, a shat on his own is dignity more than anything. So there you have it, five pounds, it works fine, probably. I think I only paid like an hour, and the nostalgia was gone, shattered like the poor seller's vase.
Jim or Jimble on Patreon.
Oh.
Lots of like, good anecdotes in this episode, Matthew.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Some quite slightly subpar games called like entries, but the actual stories, you know, top dollar. It's been good.
A copy of Broken Sword that had been chewed beyond recognition by a little dog.
I'm going to find the images for you and dump them into the Discord chat.
Yeah, this, like...
The dog gives some real damage.
It's quite hard to judge this person because it's very decent to still offer the money, even though you offered it for free. So it would be pretty, pretty cruel of me to send this person to prison. I think this is okay.
I really want to see this picture, though.
I've just uploaded five photos into Discord for you. They'll be up momentarily, Matthew. The dog chewed the top quarter off of it, basically.
Yeah, it's sort of like... That's a powerful draw on that, Staffy. Charles Cecil, livid, you know?
Yeah, that's okay. Oh, it's Broken Sword 5, The Serpent's Curse.
Did you play that one?
Yeah, a bit of it. It was sort of fine.
Is there a bit of diminishing returns in that series? I only ever played the...
A little bit, yeah.
The first one seems to be the one people love the most still, right?
Yeah, the first two are both pretty solid. I'm not like a Broken Sword super fan, I gotta admit. I really don't like George Stubbard.
I think he's a bit of a prick. So, no, I can't punish this. Five pounds isn't too bad.
The buyer has just too much of a good heart.
Yeah, okay, not guilty. Yeah, if you can still play the game as well, it's not like a huge, huge deal. The game still works.
That's really what it's about. Five quid, no problem. Okay, Matthew, penultimate entry.
Exhibit R is from Martin Smith. Hi, Samuel and Matthew.
Oh, that's the name of my stepdad. That's weird.
It's a fairly common combination of names, anyway.
Yeah, well, I've seen that. It's the first time it's come up on this podcast. I've seen it's not him.
Yeah, it doesn't go, hi, stepson Matthew. That's not in the email. Not sure if you remember me, but I put myself in the doc for Games Court about a year ago, mentioning I was about two years behind on the podcast.
I'm now only about a year behind. I've just heard my fate, guilty and thrown out of a window into a lake and had to move a full style despite my Game Boy printer, fairly given some of the crap I submitted. Now, when you tell it like that, Games Court sounds like a good podcast format, doesn't it?
It sounds pretty good. That's like, oh, that sounds right.
I think if you boil it down to like the five to ten minutes that's seen per Games Court, but everyone forgets the one hour, 15 minutes around that.
Yeah, we also didn't have an anatomy of a fall this year. We couldn't really do a conclave sort of Games Court podcast because the actual Pope died, which really sort of blew the Games Court. You can't really one up that, you know what I mean?
That's just the mean material was already pretty strong there. Okay, so just want to let you guys know that I'm still enjoying the podcast, albeit for my watery grave, and I did eventually hook my Wii U up to play Metroid Other M. It is terrible, and I did lose some respect for Matthew as he predicted.
On the plus side-
That's a bad take.
That's one of your, we'll come back to this. On the plus side, I took the opportunity to replay Ghost Squad a bit as well. So not a total waste of all the cable and plug management required.
Looking forward to at least another year's worth of podcasts. Martin Smith, Matthew Stepdad. Okay, so your take on Other M is funny, because I feel like that's your sort of do-or-die take.
If you're with me, you're with me take. You know what I mean? It's sort of like, how far will you follow Matthew Castle?
No, I just… Yeah, there is a bit of that. I think my problem with the other M…
I feel like it became this instant laughing stock because of a couple of shitty cutscenes, and I feel like a lot of people who dunk on it have never played that game. That's my big problem with it. Like Martin says, he played it and didn't like it, so fair enough.
You put in the time and if it didn't work for you, it didn't work for you. But I think the actual core loop is kind of interesting. The idea of trying to do a more team ninja-y combat system in the middle of…
in the Metroid world and maintaining a bit of DNA of both teams. I think that's quite a novel experiment. I think it's decent as an action game.
I haven't got round to my replay for our big Metroid retrospective, but I have got the Wii U plugged in. It's currently Metroid Prime 3, but once I'm through that, I will be playing Metroid Other M. I haven't played it in a long time, so maybe I will reevaluate this opinion.
But yeah, it's just like… It's a thing a lot of people know is like a goofy trailer, and that's actually what they're talking about. They're not talking about the game because they didn't play it.
They're talking about the collective internet joke about Other M.
Yeah, it's 100% a game I will play for that Metro Podcast. I really want to discuss this game properly because I only played about an hour and a half of it at the time. So yeah.
Yeah. Honest, yeah. That makes me sad.
I'm glad we chucked that guy in the lake.
So does he die again here, Matthew? Oh wait, that was just an update, wasn't it? Oh yeah, okay.
You die again. Even though I don't think you had any new entries. So yeah.
Bad news, Martin. You have been executed once again. Which room is Martin going into, Matthew?
Well, it's just plonking in the reservoir.
Perfect. Yeah. Okay, good.
Don't forget to move the little mine carts down there. That's really important, it turns out. Exhibit S is from Tim Sycamore, last entry of Games Court this week.
Thank God, the listeners say, as they hear me say that. I've recently committed an eBay purchase that could do with your expert judgment. Wild Arms Alter Code F on PS2 complete in box 110 pounds.
It's a remake of the first Wild Arms on PS1. It was never released over here, so this is a US copy. In my defense, I originally had this as a burned DVD-R, which I bought from some shady internet forum back when it first came out.
So in a way, I'm making up for a past crime by buying a legitimate copy now, which is surely an admirable thing and not deserving of whatever Baroque punishment Judge Castle is currently handing down. Being trapped in the Blueprints mansion, it turns out, Tim. Yes.
Yours faithfully, Tim Secondmore. So yeah, last entry Matthew, I thought we'd end on... I like it when someone sends in something I can't immediately make a call on, where there's a slightly interesting choice to it.
Japanese RPG series that involves a lot of guns, as the name Wild Arms suggests. I did play a bit of Wild Arms 3 on PS2, kind of like a good double A, sort of like a JRPG on PS2. I don't think it released here, but you can now play on PS4 and PS5, I believe.
Yeah, kind of, I think like one of the sort of upper tier of PS2 RPGs. I can't speak for this one really. 110 pounds though.
This is a remake of the first one, right?
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So what's your call on this, Judge?
Oh, I mean, I hate making call. I've played, have I played even half an hour of Wild Arms? I think I've played a tiny bit of Wild Arms on, I'm pretty sure it's on the PS Plus premium tier.
I think you can play like an old version of it, you know, as part of the retro library or classics library, whatever they call it.
Yeah, that is three, I think, on there.
Yeah. And I played, yeah, like I said, half an hour to see like, oh, is this going to be my next big obsession? And all I can say is it didn't hook me in half an hour, which is probably a brutally unfair metric to rate JRPGs by, particularly JRPGs of this era.
Oh, I always worry that there's a huge fan of these games, not specifically Wild Arms, but games we haven't played. And they're like, it's good, that's a good one. Don't you say guilty, cause you don't know what it is.
But like, that is what Games Court's about.
Well, a bit more context for you, Matthew. So the original on PS1, quite interesting, cause it has, I think, seems to have like sprite 2D art for the exploration and overworld stuff. And then it goes into a 3D camera, FF7 style for the actual combat.
But the PS2 remake does away with the sprite art. So it has like a PS2 era sort of like fidelity, overworld, but also the in-combat sort of art sort of matches that. Which I don't want to just say is like a net loss, but stylistically maybe seems a little bit more dated than doing the first approach.
But I don't know.
I think we need a take. And the take is, shame they didn't stick to their wild guns on this one, and that they lost a lot of charm of the original. I'm furious about this.
Everyone knows this about this remake, Altaref, and for that reason the idea of spending £110 on this is preposterous. So we've got to end with a guilty verdict.
Okay, good stuff. Well, I'm pretty certain just from a quick glance that we have more not-guilties than guilty there. So, although actually maybe we should count this and just make sure.
Count carefully because the two numbers are a solution to a puzzle in Blueprints.
It was Christmas Day all along. No, it's a definite, we have ten, ten guilties. And what letter is S in the alphabet?
This is what fucking AI is for, isn't it? 19, oh no shit, that's more guilties than not guilties. That means I've lost Matthew.
Well, look, a triumph for maths and a cataclysmic failure for Samuel Roberts, the lawyer, so such as it is. We lose, however, I did think that was one of our better game scores, Matthew, in terms of the actual quality of anecdotes in there. Would you agree with that?
Yeah, good anecdotes. I am still annoyed at myself that I don't have more wisdom to share on the subjects of Friday the 13th on the ZX Spectrum.
That's on me. I could have given Matthew a bit more of a heads up on Pepsi Man and Wild Arms, and that's to give him a bit more...
Give me a fighting chance.
Yeah, exactly. Sorry, that was on me. I didn't give Matthew...
I normally do tend to prep Matthew on what are the more esoteric things that come up.
Yeah, just in case there's anything dangerous coming down the pipes that I'm not going to like.
So that's on me for not giving Matthew a heads up there, so you can have the most well-rounded Wild Arms take possible. However, I still think that was a net gain for our great podcast, Matthew. So thank you for everyone who sent in entries.
Like I say, you can send in entries to the Discord in the Games Court Submissions channel or backpagegames.gmail.com. We'd love to hear from you and we'll do another Games Court in late summer if we get enough entries. That's that though Matthew.
Where can people get you on social media?
I am at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Blue Sky at Old Letterboxd. If you want to see a white man review Wes Anderson films, then do I have the Letterboxd account for you?
Okay, the podcast is patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us financially, get two additional podcasts a month. With all the Metroid chatter, it's worth pointing out that our Excel Patreon exclusive episode this month is two giant men play Metroid Prime Remastered, a game that once we log off from this episode, I'm going to go and play and try and finish before we record that one at the weekend Matthew. It should be a good episode.
And yeah, that's very much us done. So let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
