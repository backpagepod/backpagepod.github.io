Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. How's it going on this, the hottest day of the year, it feels like? I know you've got a J20 ready for this draft.
How's it going?
Please, a J20 spritz, and it is my second one of the evening.
Well, you know, big drinker, as ever. That's very exciting for you. I am fucking dying in this heat, though.
Do you know what? I bought an industrial fan, and it was like the recommended one by The Guardian. Very expensive, but when I ordered it, they were like, oh yeah, we'll send it to you in early August.
Now we're coming to the end of the fourth and probably final heat wave of the year, and they're like, yeah, we still haven't got it, and I'm like, well, that's fucking good, that isn't it.
Do you want to get into middle-aged fan chat because I had the exact same experience earlier this year, and I had to just go get a fancy John Lewis one, and my problems have all been solved. We could have had this conversation on WhatsApp, and I sorted you out.
You're right. It doesn't make for the most scintillating podcasting. So I will move on from that and point out that we have two other guests this week because we are doing our long-awaited quarterly four-person draft, quarterly because Matthew has to do all the editing, and it's a fucking nightmare for him.
So that's the real reason there. But yes, great to be joined once again by Dave Scarborough. Hello.
Scourge of The Back Page and Ashley Day, beloved guest of The Back Page. I will ask you both how it's going, but I'll start with you, Ash. I saw Date Everything sold half a million copies.
That's cool. How's life in general?
Yeah. Very nice to announce that. I was doing some maths earlier.
That means 50 million dates have theoretically happened, about half a million of those with a toilet. So we're all very proud, of course. Life in general, going well.
I am also incredibly sweaty. As I mentioned earlier, I've got all of the windows in my room closed, so you can't hear the noises of the outside world, but you might actually hear sweat dripping on the microphone.
So I've just assumed you've always been sweating it.
Okay, good. That sets the scene nicely. During the last episode I did with Matthew, our Patreon episode, I don't know if you realize Matthew, but I had my door open for about 10 minutes during the recording of that one.
Yeah.
Because it was so warm. I was like, do you think I wonder if you'll notice? Did you notice at all?
Well, I noticed there was a bit where there was like a perfectly pristine seagull.
There was like a seagull on a third mic. It's how good it sounded.
Yeah, that's going to be our third presenter actually, is a seagull that lives close to my flat. Yeah. So I guess I can't really get away with that.
So I too will die here. We will all die here recording this draft episode, which has 44 picks. So it's going to be intensive.
Dave, I've just about recovered from the Ghostbusters episode that you came on and did. After tanking our listener numbers to their lowest in history, you good dog. How are you doing?
I mean, we're talking about sweating and dying. We're talking about dates with toilets. Both those things have happened with me in the last 24 hours as I was quite ill from my vacation to Devon slash Cornwall.
Had a miserable evening.
We've all had a date like that, Dave. Yeah.
Yeah. I've recovered through the day. I've had a nap and I'm feeling well up for this after sending out a warning signal earlier today to say I might have to drop out, but I'm good.
We're going to get through it.
I would like to raise a criticism, Dave.
Oh, yeah. Go on.
The Ghostbusters episode, I raised this with Dave over text message. For such an enormous Ghostbusters fan, I have never met anyone else in my life who calls the marshmallow man, Stay Puft. Do people in the film even call him that?
Yeah. He's Mr. Stay Puft. He's a sailor.
He's in New York.
Is he?
We get this guy late, we're not going to have a problem.
I call him Mr. Stay Puft out of respect.
Master Stay Puft.
When you have as many as I do, you can refer to him as Stay Puft. Like that's true fans. I did get a few complaints.
I had Darren Jones messaging me. He also messaged in the Discord quite a bit, but messaging me about some shortfalls in my knowledge. There have been some recent updates to the Mega Drive version where you could play as the other, and you could play as Ernie Hudson and some other stuff that they added.
So I apologize for that and I apologize for everyone.
What do you mean updates? Who's downloading?
Well, exactly. It's not like official.
They're selling updates on their Mega Drive. Like, oh yeah, I just got patch 1.32 for my Mega Drive version of Ghostbusters.
I mean, you know the type of people. But anyway, I apologize to your listeners because a lot of them played and bought Ghostbusters games and I hope you all enjoyed them as much as I did talking about them.
Everyone who bought that 2009 game in the Discord, I was like, oh fuck, like this is going to be, we're going to gain a reputation for just people buying all kinds of bullshit and then being like, The Back Page sold me on a grand worth of six out of tens and then they basically take legal action.
I'm glad that episode's out there now because folks are impressed with my level of knowledge on the subject. And I think with today's pod, they're about to enter a world of disappointment with me. So it's good that that's out there.
Yeah, Dave's first question about this draft episode, can I still draft Call of Duty Black Ops? If something sad answer is no. So yes, that's unfortunate for all involved.
I'm sure they had a Japanese Satellite Studio on it.
Yeah, I mean, it's probably published by, you know, Tecmo Koei or something. So anyway, so I was wondering how we're all feeling about this draft episode because it is quite different to the other ones we've done. It covers a whole range of different developers.
And so the potential number of games being drafted is not limited to any one platform. It's different in that respect. Matthew, because I've not really spoken to you that much yet.
I'll ask you first, how are you feeling about this draft?
I'm feeling good. It feels like a draft where we could very easily not step on each other's toes quite comfortably. And as people will hear, there are a couple of rule tweaks to maybe remedy that.
But yeah, I mean, it's a suite of great studios. I really like the mix of them, old and new. Hopefully getting some stuff which has never come up on drafts before.
Definitely interested in surfacing some new games after endlessly picking whatever fucking a car on the end time split is too.
Yeah, the Simpsons hit and run. The perennial draft loser, the Simpsons hit and run. So Ash, you helped shape the categories for this draft.
And we had a bit of back and forth about who didn't make the cut. So I'll just read those out now. So for people who have a reference point.
So we've got Capcom, Konami, From Software, Namco, Sega, Square Enix, Nintendo, Sony, Taito, Taito. Fuck me, I can never pronounce that properly. Treasure.
And then there's a free pick category as well.
I will say, Sam, it's Taito, not Taito. And the reason everyone should know this is when you start the original puzzle bobble, you hear Bub and Bob at the beginning go, Taito. So there you go.
You now know it is Taito.
We did have a bit of back and forth on who should or shouldn't make the cut. But it's definitely not a commentary on who matters necessarily. But I think maybe there was a bit of trade-off of, should Tecmo Koei be in the mix?
I think Irem you pushed for as well, R-Type developers. I'm curious what you make of the end list of categories and whether you think there are any major emissions as the expert on this stuff in this episode.
I'm pretty happy with it. I think realistically we had to prioritize developers and publishers who've been around for a long time and are still producing games today. A lot of the developers I'm sad to see go, companies like Irem or Hudson Soft, they haven't really been going concerns for a few decades and I think it would have made the draft quite limiting.
I did insist that we put Taito in there. They made Space Invaders. They pretty much founded Japanese games as we know them as an industry in the arcade era.
They're still technically around today, just owned by Square Enix. As for Treasure to be in there, I think they're emblematic of what makes Japanese games interesting. Should SNK have been in there?
I think SNK are pretty cool and they're on an amazing streak right now with some excellent new games, but it's mostly all fighting games and probably wouldn't be that interesting.
Anything that highlights our lack of fighting game knowledge, I'm always scared of. We just avoid anything that makes us look like dumbasses, basically.
Well, I don't think this is entirely Two Giant Men proof this episode in that respect, but we'll see how it goes.
We've got ash to offer nutritional value.
Exactly. Dave, what do you make of the categories? Did you have to do a lot of swatting up for this?
Or did you have a lot of knowledge in the back pocket on Taito?
Yeah, speaking of idiots, I feel like I'm at the biggest disadvantage. I feel a bit fucked coming into this draft, if I'm honest. This isn't necessarily my strong suit when we're talking like Taito and Treasure.
But yes, I did swat up. I did my revision. I did my coursework over the last week, played some games.
Obviously got a list of, from the big hitters, I've got a huge list. For some of the more retro stuff which passed me by at the time, I had to look into it just to cover my back. Because as we've seen time and time again, a lot of stuff gets taken off the ball pretty quickly so I just had to make sure I had some backups from the few that I had played.
So it should be fun. Please don't hurt me.
I'll try not to be too mean when you pick something like Radiant Silver Gun and use adjectives like effervescent to describe the game design. So I'll be in a sense that you don't know what you're talking about.
I played everything I put on here. I played everything I put on here. So the effervescence comes from an authentic place.
Yes, well, the interesting thing about that, of course, is that we've got a few new rules that mean it's not necessarily guaranteed that what you've picked will necessarily be what you end the draft with, but we'll get into those after the break. So before we take that break, I did want to ask what the four of us should do next. Matthew, have you thought much about where we could take the four-person draft?
I thought a bit about, could we do like Nintendo handhelds as a whole thing or I don't know, have you given this much thought of what else we could do with this volume of people?
I was interested to see how this region-specific version works out and thought that could be rolled out to European studios or American studios. Okay, maybe those are the only two I thought of. But yeah, I'm just interested to see because having whole studios as categories allows you to have so many games.
So yeah, I am curious if that can kind of put the pressure on still.
Indeed, yes. Ash, you got any suggestions, anything come to mind for you of, it'll be a humdinger to do a draft, a full person draft for X format or X type of game subcategories?
What are you guys like on the Amiga?
I'm okay.
There's some bad PC ports, I don't know. I'm not really, yeah.
Not going to say it's my strong suit.
We let you down, Ash. It'll just have to be you and Darren Jones.
I do think the Nintendo DS would make an amazing draft and I know Matthew would be pretty up for that. I'm not sure about you guys.
I am up for that. I wonder if we should combine DS and 3DS or whether we just stretch that library to its limits. I'm not sure.
Have you ever thought about like a mega console draft, each category is a console?
I guess that's kind of in the vein of this, right?
They're just ideas. We're just brainstorming here. There's no bad ideas in a brainstorm, apart from the Amiga one that we all heard.
Okay. Well, good stuff. We've got a lot of picks to get through.
So let's take a quick break and we'll come back and explain some of our exciting and potentially confusing new rules.
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, a small caveat about section one of this episode. Discord was being a motherfucker, and so it meant that we had lag between all of our different responses.
So it was like recording a podcast on a fucking 56K modem. So even more of a palaver than normal to record a four person podcast. But it does mean that we are getting a bit more real time feedback.
So I can hear Matthew laughing at my jokes within half a second, as opposed to five seconds. That's good Matthew.
In the lag version, it's like one of the, you get those clips of Big Bang Theory where they've removed the laughter track and it becomes super eerie. That was like the vibe of recording the podcast.
Yeah, it all goes a bit lynchian, which is not the vibe you want for a draft really.
This is all temporary until The Back Page Studios gets up and running properly, when it will be a full YouTube, Spotify integrated video podcast, right?
Yeah. We'll move right into that big empty office building that's near Makoko and Bath, Matthew.
We'll all have our heads inside coffee tables. It'll be amazing.
So yes, which I'm fucking relieved that's sorted, because I was worried that the draft chemistry was going to be messed with, and so luckily it's all isolated to the preamble and no one enjoys those anyway. So I'm only joking. So this is a snake draft as usual.
So whoever wins the coin toss picks first, and then it goes second, third, fourth, and then the fourth person then picks again, and it goes third, second, first, and then continues until the draft is over. All the games selected must primarily have been developed in Japan. For the major publishers represented here, the game has to be developed in-house or be entirely owned by that company, the developer.
So Atlus would actually count for Sega if you absolutely must. Any ambiguity will be put to a group vote on whether it counts or not, but I will say that in general, I think I saw the goal of this to capture the spirit of the developers in question, or the publishers in question, as opposed to trying to be too clever. But what do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, I'd agree with that. I certainly haven't tried to be too clever. I don't think I can.
So no Zelda games for Capcom, Matthew? You're not going to do that?
Well, no. I think you... I think...
No, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that. I don't think Minish Cap is going to be a fucking winning entry.
Yeah, but Oracle of Seasons and Ages might have been, you know.
The Discord definitely pissed on my parade with this because... They were very much in my long list, but, you know, who knows? We'll see how desperate times get now.
You must have played other Capcom games, Dave. They can't be like...
Oh, yeah, of course. I've played other ones, but you just don't know what gets taken off the board. And, you know, I tried to make it interesting.
I'm an entertainer. I'm not, Sam.
You know this. That's true.
You know, no sane man would have picked Lost Viadomus as an earnest pick in the last draft.
But that's why you're here, Dave. You bring that entertainment factor, that loose canon energy that really gives the draft its life. And, meanwhile, there's Ash sincerely picking some wonderful games that only eight people have played.
And I think it just really, the chemistry of it is just right. So, Ash, do you, how do you feel about that particular rule? Do you think that's fair that, you know, we're trying to capture the spirit of the developers more than anything?
Yeah, I massively disagree that Atlas would count as a Sega developer. Atlas existed for many years as an independent entity. So, if anyone's going to start arguing the toss over stuff, it's probably going to be me getting all technical and like, het up about things.
But I'll try and keep that to a minimum. We want to keep it fun. But it possibly depends how competitive I get and how much I want Dave to lose as well.
So, we'll see.
Well, maybe we say that if you had acquired an entire publisher, you don't get to have those. So maybe we should say that Atlas only gets picked in the free pick category. Would that be better, Ash, if we tweak that rule?
I'm much happier with that.
Okay. Well, that's fine. We'll tweak that then.
So, no Persona 5 for Sega. And I imagine that won't change anyone's strategy too much. But it does mean that that free pick category becomes slightly more pivotal.
Now for the new rules that we're adding to this episode. So, I've sort of teased these a little bit on social media, but not really shed light. So, we're introducing two new rules called Steal and Kill.
Everyone gets one of each to use. Think of them as like tokens you can deploy throughout the draft. I will explain these and then we will discuss some of the rule headaches that this creates.
So, Steal. At the start of your turn, you can take another game from someone else's draft picks. That counts as your turn.
A game can only be stolen once, so a game can't be passed around multiple times. Kill. At the start of your turn, remove one pick from any draft list entirely.
The game cannot be selected again. The affected party must then re-pick for that category. This does not count as your turn, but the key thing is that you have to use both of these at the start of your turn.
You can't pick and then do it, or pick in the middle of someone else's turn. The kills and steals will be factored into the final draft results, and what I mean by that is you'll have all of the games you picked, then you'll have the games that you killed and stole. So, you know, the things that people are making a judgment on the list, it'll be a little bit spicier than normal.
I thought this would be a fun thing to try. Matthew, was this partly inspired by something MinMax did? Isn't that the conversation kick-off for this?
This was partly inspired by MinMax's excellent Hall of Fame episode. They try and pick five other things, so five 3D platformers, five Mario games, five Switch games, and everyone has a veto which can outright kill something. What it basically does is allow someone to come in and get rid of sacred cows or the kind of boring trusty things that always kind of fill out these lists.
And I enjoyed the drama of it, like hanging over it. I like that some people use them quite surgically to remove things that they genuinely thought were poor. Other people were just shitlords about it and use them to get rid of things.
And I thought, oh yeah, that's good. That's good drama. Hopefully it doesn't make the whole thing like too vindictive.
Like you don't want the draft turning like toxic. I'd say this is a bit of a dry run to see how it plays out, right?
It is, yeah. Dave, how do you feel about these rules? Which I think I flagged to you a while ago now.
I feel like these bring delicious chaos to the mix. We were talking about this on text the other night. It's going to be really fun to listen to.
Is it going to be fun for us as we're trying to put together a competent list of games? I don't know. But it does add a layer of strategy that I'm quite interested in or quite excited to dig into.
And it really plays into my shit heel persona that I've cultivated over the last few drafts.
It sure does, pal. And Ash, how do you feel about these rules? Because you sort of did a big sigh before we started recording about when you saw the document.
How are you feeling about it?
Yeah, I'm not sure I relish the idea of giving a detailed and passionate speech about Maze of Galleus on the MSX, really pouring my heart into explaining why you should play this game only to have Dave kill it the next turn.
It's great radio.
Yeah, that's the thing. We have prioritized good podcasting over a good podcasting experience for the people making the podcast, which is sometimes the trade-off you make when you're creating potentially award-winning audio. So that's what's got into it.
And now we're going to have a short FAQ section to discuss some of the fallout that these rules will create and what happens in those situations. This is new information to Ash and Dave, but it is also up for debate as well if we think this is not right. So for example, right, so this is the really key thing that Matthew raised.
Once a game has been stolen, can it be killed? And my feeling on that is that it makes it too binary that you'll just automatically kill the thing that was stolen from you and they kind of cancel each other out as tokens. So I think that the the steal should be immortal and you have to use the kill on something else.
I agree with that completely. But can you steal a steal?
No, no, because I think that was already in the in the rules. A game could only be stolen once.
Yeah. Thanks for reading.
The tensions begin already. Yeah. So yes, that was a key thing.
And Matthew, there was another thing we discussed as well.
So the other thing, you can obviously only steal into a category you haven't already claimed. Like, if you pick Mario Galaxy and then someone picks Mario Odyssey and you decide you want that, you can't get rid of Mario Galaxy to steal Mario Odyssey, you know. You have to steal into an empty slot.
So there's some strategy in leaving slots open for highly competitive things, I guess. I don't know, it's up to you guys to decide how you want to play, but...
Could I steal from one category and put it in a different category?
No.
Well, how would you do that? Because you've already got...
Well, if I wanted to put it in free pick...
Free pick's not of the above, though, is it?
What about those weird ones where it's like a co-development? You know, like the Minish Cap scenario. If I went to steal Minish Cap from Matthew, who's going to pick it and take it Nintendo, is that for that one?
You think I'm going to pick fucking Minish Cap out of all the Nintendo games ever made?
Minish Cap's getting a real beating on this podcast. I like Minish Cap, but I don't know if it deserves it.
I just don't even know why it's coming up.
You almost won a draft with Minish Cap, like, three weeks ago, Matthew.
No one wins a draft with just one game. You win them with ten excellent picks.
Yeah, perhaps. But, yeah, so I think that is a good rule, because, yes, it does mean what you leave space for is potentially a tactical maneuver as well. I think that just means there's a bit of like permanence to the tokens, which I think is, I think that just adds to the quality, again, of the radio, but not the experience for the people making the radio.
But, again, I'm sure we'll survive. Those are the rules. I don't know if there's anything else to cover.
Ash, Dave, do you have anything else you want to raise around this before we get started? Anything you want to clearing up?
Yeah, if you have a game killed, do you then have, is your slot then empty and needs filling again or is your slot destroyed as well?
Yeah, and the affected party must repick for that category. But I guess we didn't decide turn order.
Well, no, I was going to, they...
They'd have to do it in the next turn, surely, or in a subsequent turn.
Yes, that's the key thing, Matthew. It's when your turn comes back around. So, there's actually...
I've actually put four, but maybe there should be eight extra turns in there to account for when we each have to repick for the things where we've had games killed or stolen. I think that makes the most sense.
Also, you don't have to steal and kill. You don't have to pretend you.
Yeah, I guess you don't.
Or are you literally forcing our hands?
This is your too nice persona, Matthew. I got... Your wife, I spoke to a developer, and she told me I have to be a dickhead to you as well.
Like, this is going to make it harder for me to do when you're trying to appeal to the good-natured audience with, you know, I don't want to kill, I don't want to steal off anyone.
That's me. No, I'm just saying. But if you get to the end and you're like, if everyone else has used their kill and steals and you've got what you want, then what's necessarily the point?
I mean, it's unlikely to happen.
Yeah, I guess it's a bit... I'm not denying that they're shit lord rules. Yeah, I mean, I guess we'll see.
But I think already there's a bit of vote propaganda for you, isn't it, Matthew? But doing a bit of humble old Matancy.
I guess if I have to be horrible.
No, if we want to imagine we're all wearing explosive collars that go off if we haven't stolen and killed by the end, that's fine. I'm happy to do that.
Yeah, I guess the only advantage you get is that in that results thing, it will just say stole, none, killed.
Ah, well, this is a really interesting thing, right? When it comes to listeners voting, are they going to reward us for this behavior or punish us?
Yeah, well, that's the thing. I guess it depends a lot of it is what comes down to what is being killed, what is being stolen, and from who, and in which categories. I think that maybe if they sent someone being predatory in some way, they'll be like, fuck that guy.
So we can't rule that out, I guess.
We don't know how people are going to react to it, I guess is the answer. So you've got to like, will they reward an amazing strategic play, or will they just look at it and go, you are the guy who killed Mario Galaxy. That seems dumb.
Yeah, but they might also be like, that was great podcasting.
Yeah, so I will reward it.
My big fear is this is going to go the way of every Uno game I play with my family in which I just become the target of all of their plus fours versus cloth games.
That's the funniest outcome, that all three steals and kills are used against just Dave.
That is my fear coming into this.
Yeah.
But I also-
I know who I am, I know what I represent on this podcast.
But I also know the quality of games you pick, so stealing shouldn't really be a thing.
Right. That is another key thing. Ash Dave, you have to be dicks to Matthew at some point during this episode, because for too long he's managed to be Switzerland in these drafts, and then fucking storm it.
Remember, he is the big dog. He is the one with the most wins. He's won every single one.
This is your puppet mastering so that we don't target you.
Desperate to win.
I'm not desperate to win, I just won a draft. I'm fine. I'm just saying.
I think it needs to be even. Matthew cannot be Switzerland while we invade mainland Europe. That can't be what Matthew does.
So.
While we invade non-specific country.
Yeah, I was going to say that.
That's true.
We're just going to make up.
No, I'm not going to. This isn't a game of Civ. I'm not going to say.
What, the countries in Superman? It's those.
Okay, fine. If you must ask, Dave is Nazi Germany, I'm the United Kingdom and Ash, you're Soviet Russia. I hope that's okay.
And we'll go from there. So I think that's the FAQ portion of the episode taking care of, meticulously discussing rules that we chucked in for a laugh. It's basically the summary there.
But now I'm just going to recap the categories before we do the coin toss and decide who is going to be drafting first. So category one, Capcom, category two, Konami, category three, From Software, category four, Namco, category five, Sega, category six, Square Enix, category seven, Nintendo, category eight, Sony, category nine, Taito, category 10, Treasure, category 11, free pick, brackets, none of the above, Dave. So yes.
I mean, that is actually a problem because I do have a couple of games in the above, but I will take them out.
Just pick a fucking, you know, like wise or something. One of those RPG series you don't give a shit about. Just pick one of those, Dave, it'll be fine.
I've got a couple of great games in here.
Yeah, is it The Ghostbusters by Howl?
Oh, please pick that for Nintendo. That would just be, that would make the draft so much easier for the rest of us. Okay.
I've got a wheel of names. It's not a towing course.
Oh, how exciting. Yes, okay. So I guess pick who goes first, Matthew.
Let's see. Well, I won't. The wheel will.
Here it goes. It's making a noise.
It's Ash.
Is that good?
Is first good?
I don't know anymore.
It's hard to tell when you have to wait this long to pick.
Second. Second is...
Samuel.
Oh, I'm happy with that. I'll take that.
So going third, the great Matthew Day face off.
Switzerland versus Nazi Germany. Oh my God.
It was always going to come down to this.
And it goes to... it goes to the Nazis. It's Dave.
I really actually do not approve of this characterization.
Sorry. Completely unnecessary. Okay, good.
I don't know why I was waiting for the fourth one. I know who the fourth one is. Sorry.
Okay, good. All right then. Well, Ash, would you like to kick us off?
It's already impossible.
I'll immediately steal off you, Ash.
Yeah. Well, yeah. Wherever I pick, someone's going to steal.
And I think the thing I want to pick most to hurt someone else, I should just wait until they pick it and steal it from them.
Yeah.
So I'm not going to do that.
As no games have been picked, you can technically kill another contestant in this first round.
Dave is dead. Get off the call, Dave. You're out of the draft.
So I'd be back at primary school getting picked for football.
I need to take a world class, amazing game that gets me off to a good start, but no one's going to steal it or kill it.
Well, remember though, you've got to have 11 picks. They can only steal one. So it's not like they're going to, will they blow through it straight away?
Perhaps, but probably not. I wouldn't worry about it too much.
No, you should worry about it.
Let's go Sony. I've got two choices in front of me. One I think all of you want.
The other one is really formative for me, and I played it with my daughter this weekend. So I'm going to go that one. That's Parappa the Rapper.
Oh, okay. Well, Matthew won't steal that one.
The first time Parappa the Rapper has ever been the first pick in a draft.
First and last. In this or any other timeline.
I should point out it's developed by an indie, it's developed by Nana Onsha, but like this is a Sony IP, right? They own it. Yeah, any dispute there.
Do I have to say why Parappa the Rapper is cool? It invented rhythm action pretty much, amazing characters, memorable songs. You can play through it in half an hour and have a good time.
It's like playing an album. It's immortal. All the sequels are shit.
Parappa is awesome.
Yeah. I mean, I agree. It's meant to be played on a CRT TV in the 90s.
Playing at any other point on any other format is problematic for various reasons, but at the time it was perfect. It was a great symbol of what you could do with the PlayStation, the CD, audio, and the fact that the games weren't mega expensive. If this was a 60 quid N64 card, I think everyone would be livid at it, but perfect for PS1 and what I perceived as the PlayStation of the era cool vibe they were cultivating in the marketing sense.
He was on the cover of, was it Face magazine? He was on the cover of, which just sounds like I dreamt that. It's ridiculous.
Yeah. Is there something that Nathan Brown read about in a nightclub or something in the 90s? So I've just listened to that particular episode of My Favorite Console, so that's fresh in my mind.
I think it's a good pick, Ash. I don't think it will be stolen, is my personal taste.
You should just kill it straight away.
Don't kill Parappa.
I did pick that with the heart fill. I played this with my daughter this weekend, you know.
Okay, so my pick is next. Category 1 Capcom, I'm going to take Resident Evil 2 Remake 2019. So, I wanted to split the difference with my Capcom pick between old Capcom and new Capcom, even though I know that SNES era and arcade era players will say that PS1 Capcom is not old Capcom, but to most people, I think over the age of 30, it is.
Sorry, under the age of 40, I should say, it's probably more accurate actually there. This is a remake of PS1 Classic. It was really a kind of gold standard out of the gates sign of how Capcom were to handle these remakes, taking a bit of the third-person shooting of Resi 4, that kind of like basic over-the-shoulder template, but keeping the desperate lack of ammo feel of the PS1 games and the puzzle elements and making sure the environments feel super rich.
It may be killed out of the gates, but there are quite a lot of good Capcom games. But I wanted one that I just felt threaded the needle of all the different things that I like about Capcom games, and this does. And I read that pretty much every financial quarter there seems to sell another million copies for Capcom.
Is this, deep down in our hearts, is it the best Resident Evil game?
I think it might be the one, the modern resi that ticks the most boxes. What do you all think?
It's not my favourite, which might come up, but it's up there. It's probably my second. Yeah, the remake is fantastic.
It takes the feeling of the original and then puts around it modern gameplay trappings that just sort of elevate the whole thing.
It raised the bar for remakes, full stop, I would say.
It gave us Mr. X, which the idea of the constantly pursuing enemy is just such a key trope of this podcast.
Oh, it is. Without it, we would have been fucked. We would have lasted five years, that's for sure.
Okay, good. Well, it seems to be agreed upon that is a solid pick, in which case I will fear it being stolen or killed for the rest of the game. But Dave, what's your first pick?
It's a tough one. There is so much to choose from. And it is that tricky thing of getting something off the board that other people want, but not too early, in case it just gets stolen anyway.
I'm going to go with something that's dead boring, but is one of my favorite games of all time. It's not my favorite game of all time, which is Ocarina of Time, Nintendo, Category 7. This is totally a hard pick, because I just absolutely love this game.
Like the countless hours I've played of it over the years I didn't actually even own it on the N64, I borrowed it off a mate and then just never gave it back to him. Thus, the origin story of my only being a bastard. But yeah, like the scope of this game was unlike anything I'd played before, and the jump to 3D for the franchise as well just showed sort of the breadth of what was possible with both the lore of Zelda and with the sort of RPG genre.
Yeah, I just love it. I don't know what else to say that hasn't been said before about it.
Did you get TrapGPT to come up with those points, Dave?
Would you describe the game as effervescent, Dave?
Oh, well, okay.
Would you say it redefined RPGs and 3D and sort of like ushered in an era of 3D gaming that hadn't been seen before?
Poor Dave. He's so ill. And it just came out of the podcast anyway, and he's just been mocked on Pick One.
And I've been up since 5 a.m. Mocked on Pick One after doing a huge favor for three of it or two of his friends. Ash is no longer his friend.
So I think it's well, just to go, just just to be more specific, if you're looking for specificity then Ash from, oh, Prepper the Rapper was a game I played with my daughter, had great music and a great soundtrack, which is all you said.
Matilda loves it, Dave.
Was that this for me was the first game that was sort of something that would become more common when I was like into Souls games later on. It's like that word of that sort of sharing stories with friends and finding out there was just more of the world to sort of unravel and to unlock, you know, I remember the sort of runner that goes around Hyrule and the overworld and like being told by a friend, you have to be there at a certain time to run into him. And then you get the whole sort of exchange where you get a mask.
It's like it's stuff like that that really brings that world alive, even when, you know, it's quite quaint by modern standards. And arguably Majora's Mask did a lot of that stuff better. But taking place first in Ocarina of Time, it just made that whole world just feel completely different to anything else I played.
Yeah, I think this raised an interesting question about this draft more generally, I think, which is how, how far back do you go to define some of these companies? Because obviously this is an incredibly, you know, important milestone for Nintendo in the progression of their games, and therefore I think it's a really good pick. And I think that in some ways it is good to approach this pick, not necessarily with the mindset of what is the greatest to play now, but more of like what was great in its time, but also what represents, you know, the kind of like the company more generally.
And I think that is an approach worth taking. I think the wrapper ticks that box, Rosy 2 obviously more modern. But I think Ocarina of Time is a good pick, Dave.
Hugely significant game.
I'm just looking for stuff that has that magic quality to it with a lot of these companies, right? Like some of the stuff might not be their best game, but there was something about when they arrived that just felt different and just gave you something unique within that period, within that era. For the impact it made, like it's still just like that feeling of first walking in Tyrol when you sort of escape through, well not escape, you leave Link's home and just sort of see the fields for the first time and just like that wow, holy shit moment.
Like it just felt, it was just so different to anything else I played at that time.
It set the template for Zelda games for the next like almost 20 years really up until Breath of the Wild.
Even Breath of the Wild does it to a degree, you know, it's still that, it's still trying to capture that same sense of wonder and scale, you know, when you first step out onto the cliff top and see Hyrule in front of you, it's essentially emulating that same moment.
Yeah, it's all open world games are still trying to do it. They're all trying to do the look at this big world out in front of you moment. There wouldn't be, you know, that same moment in the likes of Oblivion or whatever without this game.
Even though when I last played it, I was like, get me the fuck out of this village with all these little tree lads. I'm desperate to go somewhere else. And, you know, that's how it felt majestic in that sense, for sure.
Good stuff. We come around to Matthew Castle, co-host of The Back Page podcast, for his first pick. He has two picks.
So what do you got, Matthew?
For my first pick, for From Software, I'm going to take Sekiro.
Interesting.
I'm taking this purely on the grounds of it's the From Software game I made the most progress in, which admittedly isn't an amazing accomplishment. The order, if you're interested, is Sekiro, Elden Ring, Bloodborne Dark Souls. What I do like about Sekiro compared to their other games is the fact that it is a set character and I feel like there's something cleaner in that.
This is the guy, this is the set of powers you've got to get through, where in all their other games I'm constantly thinking, do I suck at this? Have I made a terrible character? Have I just doomed myself on this run?
And that's like pretty much the fundamental tension of why I don't really get on with Souls likes, is that I'm always thinking of the what if and those systems never really blossom for me. But the idea of here is a beautiful world, a super sharp, super tight combat system, and we're just really upfront about what you have to get through with it. I like that, I think that's worth celebrating, and it's why for me it's the pick.
Yeah, I love this game obviously. It is also my most played and favourite from software game. I'd love to hear Ash and Dave what you think of Sekiro.
Ash, what's your take on this one?
I absolutely adore Sekiro. I'd say it's more of a skill based game than the other Souls likes. You can't really cheese your way through by like levelling up and grinding for all the best equipment.
To use a horrible phrase, you have got to get good. It is also like, I think, quite achievable to get good. It almost feels like a Capcom game in that it gives you the tools and they are there to be mastered if you just keep playing.
And then the rewards are there, like it feels awesome when you pull off like a great parry or beat a particularly challenging boss. It's got all the other things that From Software Games have as well in terms of an amazing sense of place that evolves over time and makes you want to explore it. It's yes, 10 out of 10 masterpiece.
Dave, I know they based the Ape Boss in this on you. So how do you feel about this game?
That's my favorite bit of it. I think like touching on what Ash was saying there, the way that the combat is sort of shaped in this game, it gives you more of a cinematic flair than the other Souls games. Yeah, it is very skill based.
Who's the boss? I want to say Madame Butterfly, right?
Is it Lady Butterfly? I can't remember which of the two it is.
Yeah, but that's sort of that turning point that all of From Software, sort of Souls-like games have, where it's like you either get stuck or you overcome this and then you finish the game. You know, it's the Smaug and Ornstein sort of fight again. But unlike those other games, as Ash was saying, you can't just go away, level up, just like cheese 50 levels and come back with more armor.
You know, it has to be skill. It has to be repetition and learning the moves and learning, like, you know, to time precisely those dodges and parries. And it's that sort of precision that sets it apart.
And I think it's, yeah, I think it's a great game. It's strange to me that they haven't done a follow up yet, but maybe one day.
I wonder if that's like an Activision thing, because obviously they're sort of part of it. Yeah, and plus, I guess Elden Ring has just been so successful, like so much more successful than anything they've made before. So maybe that just changed their focus a little bit.
I don't know. Or they had to appease all those, all five of the real Armored Corps fans that are out there, Matthew. There might have been the other thing.
Yeah, so I love this game. One of my favorites of all time. It's one of the few games I've genuinely mastered.
Like I did New Game Plus on it. I got the more elaborate ending. I fought the Owlfather, which is one of the greatest boss fights of all time, which I discussed in this podcast before.
It's a great pick. So what's your next pick, Matthew?
My next pick for Konami, I'll take Metal Gear Solid V, The Phantom Pain.
Interesting.
There's several Metal Gear Solids you could pick, which are equally important to me for different reasons. This one's probably just in my head at the moment because I've been playing a lot of Death Stranding 2, and that has hints of open-world stealth. But whenever I'm doing it, I'm just constantly reminded of, oh, I remember that time they did that proper open-world stealth game where stealth was really rewarded and was the focus of the game, because it definitely isn't in Death Stranding 2.
Just the total freedom, the way all the mad gadgets and technologies and allies that you leveled up over the game kind of constantly evolved your moveset. You could return to the same village and it would feel completely different based on sort of hour five, 10, 50, 100. And I love the evolution of that.
I still think it's just one of the all-time great play pens and maybe not a great indicative game of Konami as a whole. Like it's kind of a thing they don't do again. Oh, haven't certainly since.
And obviously the whole Kojima of it all is messy. But I don't know. I think this is technically their game that I enjoy the most.
I mean, it's weird thinking that we are just three weeks from this game turning 10 years old.
Yeah.
I mean, that just shows how frozen in time the sort of graphics quality of everything is these days. Yeah. Ash, I'd love to hear what your take on MGS5 is.
I don't know if we've ever talked about it in the podcast.
Yeah.
I love it. I think there's a really valid case for it being the best Metal Gear Solid. And everything Matthew said, I completely agree with.
Fantastic open world game brings together a lot of what was happening on the periphery of the Metal Gear franchise, like in the PSP games, which some people might not have played, but it brought it into the mainstream and amped it up. And I'm not a big story guy in games. I'll quite happily skip a cut scene or look at my phone, but not in a Kojima game.
MGS5 legitimately made me cry. Like the funeral scene on the tanker. I'll say no more than that.
I just think it's one of the most beautiful and poetic things that's ever been in a video game. So, yeah, I applaud that choice.
Just with quiet in her bikini in the background.
That as well.
Sexy, sexy grief.
It's kind of weird with Konami because it feels, as a developer publisher, they're so defined by Kojima that it's hard to sort of separate.
Defined by Kojima in the last 20 or so years, they've got an amazing classic arcade catalog, Super Nintendo stuff.
The arcade run is amazing.
But you wouldn't remember that.
I remember it. I've got some arcade games. We talked about this.
Gradius, Contra, all those Castlevanias, pre-Symphony of the Night, plenty in there to pick still. Interesting. Matthew, two ultra modern games to kick off with.
It would be a shame if someone stole them. Wouldn't it?
I've got a lot of turns before it's my turn again, so.
I don't plan on using my kill or steal tokens, because I'm just here to be a good sport.
I've picked really good games. I'd be so upset to take one from you.
I'm going to say up front, if you take either of these games from me, I'm going to find the thing you love the most in your final ten and kill it.
All right, Liam Neeson in Taken.
I absolutely guarantee you that. I will be vengeful.
Well, you know, that just proves my point. This makes for better podcasting. Not for the people making it in the episode, as I said before, but for the listeners, they're having a great time.
Take what I love and I'll kill what you love even more.
I will. I'll wait until the end to work out which of the things you love the most.
Right, so how does the turn order work? Who's going to get the final turn? Is it Matthew?
Well, it depends on how many of the kill and steal tokens get taken.
I have to think very carefully about this because I believe his threat. I really do.
Me too, but it's all about who pulls the trigger first.
I have to protect my babies, somehow.
In many ways, that's the magic of podcasting. Dave Scarborough, what's your next pick?
Well, that's why I think he's for the shit, so I'm going to steal MGS5 in the army category straight away.
Yes. Well, no one else can take it or kill it now. That's yours, Dave.
Boom.
What a great game. Listen, it's Davey Bowie while running around a desert, lifting goats up into the air with a balloon and everything Matthew said on top of that.
Oh, Dave. You motherfucker. Oh, Dave.
You marked for death, my friend.
Dave, I'm doubling your fee to 80 pounds. Well done. That's good stuff.
Well, I look forward to you taking you Ghostbusters too late, Matthew.
Oh, Dave. I love it, Dave. Oh, wonderful.
OK, comes back around to me then.
That's very annoying. I don't want to have to do another fucking spiel.
All right.
Go on.
I mean, Matthew, would you like to comment any further on The Phantom Page or should we move on?
No.
The Phantom Page is the game that he lost.
OK, all right. So my next pick, I'm going to take category 10 treasure and pick Ikaruga, which I have played this week for the first time. I played this and Radiant Silver Gun, actually.
Radiant Silver Gun, way too fucking hard, frankly, just preposterous really. This game, Ikaruga, has accessibility settings built into the concept of the game, which I really appreciate. Some of my slightly fucked eyes can see what's going on because you have this binary types of firepower, white and black projectiles coming towards you, and you switch between basically a white and black ship with a little shield, and you can use that shield to protect yourself from the respective color of projectiles coming towards you.
So it's a game of frantic switching and shooting and unleashing little charge attacks. All the projectiles that you absorb, you can then fire those back towards your enemies. Great levels, like a really handsome looking game.
This is like a GameCube favorite. There's a few treasure games I like for sure, but I wanted to pick something that's got a bit of that old school arcade DNA, a bit of Sega Saturn DNA to it. Just something that was, you know, like I think is beloved, but I do want to just pick Astro Bot and Mega Factor like I always do.
So Astro Boy and Mega Factor like I always do, and bang on about that. But Ikaruga is really fucking good, man. It's a bit, a touch easier than Radiant Silver Gun, and you can play, and it's like tons of versions of this on Switch, Xbox and PC.
It's easy to play these days, but I think it is a classic.
So Ash, I'll ask you first. I'm honestly like thrilled and delighted that you've played this game for the first time and can see how cool it is because it is such a cool game. And I agree, it was kind of marketed as a sequel to Radiant Silver Gun, but it's way more accessible, way more fun as well.
Did you know, you mentioned the kind of color switching, so you can swap to a certain color so that you are protected by it. But if you swap to the opposite color, so you're not protected by it and you're shooting down those ships, you score like more points. So it rewards you for playing in the riskier, more hardcore way.
So if you're like a score attack chaser, you can have a really thrilling, like a bullet hell experience. But if you just want to like play it more like a puzzle game, get through the level, see the next stage, it does allow for that other mode of play as well. So I think it's a really genius game.
Even when you play it in that more accessible way, it's still rock hard, to be honest. Yeah. But I think it's like a really learnable shooter as well.
Like every level does feel like a puzzle that you can work out. So yeah. And like you said, it's available on loads of platforms.
So it's out there. You can get it dirt cheap. I think everyone should play this even if you don't think you like shoot them ups.
Like you'll get something out of it, I think.
Yeah. So I played the Xbox version, which was, I forgot that Treasure did a bunch of XBLA ports back in the day. And pretty much all of those are backwards compatible on Xbox.
So yeah, you can just go back and play this. And you can change the settings so it becomes easier, but not too easy that it removes the core difficulty of the game that it was so infamous for on GameCube. And yeah, I honestly thought this was like, there was a gulf between this and Radiant Silver Gun in terms of how I could parse it, how I could memorize bits of it.
And also just like the quality of the levels and just the genius concept of that polarity mechanic at the center of the game. So really good. Matthew, did you ever play Ikaruga?
Was this on your GameCube library?
I've played the tiniest amount of this XBLA and I'm just so shit at these kind of games. So I don't have any deep thoughts on it, which means it's absolutely safe. I'm not gonna steal it.
I'm not gonna kill it. Obviously, because I'm gonna kill one of Dave's games. So yeah, Ikaruga, absolutely safe.
Ascend to safety.
Well maybe not safe from Ash.
I feel like your headspace is not in a positive place right now, man.
I'm literally looking at Ocarina of Time going, yeah, I'll just kill Ocarina of Time. That'll be fine.
I can't believe that, I mean, Dave took Catherine's advice to heart and it's gone straight for Matthew.
Just, like, be completely straight with me. You three haven't like secretly agreed to like fuck with me during this draft, have you?
No, but now you say that. You're making me want to. Okay.
I love the idea that you already think that we're turning on you. That's, no, there's no conspiracy, Matthew. It's okay.
We come back around to Ash.
Well, well, I don't really want to add fuel to Matthew's conspiracy theories. However, however, he did make the mistake of picking Mai from software. Oh, and I am going to steal it.
Matthew is back to no games. Great drafting, though, Matthew, clearly.
You just picked really good games.
Well, that's not how I thought this would go. I didn't think this would happen so soon. So anything you'd like to add about Sekiro Ash or is that pretty much it?
I mean, Matthew did a fantastic job of explaining why I should steal Sekiro.
Yeah, great.
I should add that I never finished it. I've never finished it.
Oh, you should. It's good.
Did you start it?
I started it many times.
Maybe I'll play it tomorrow.
Wow.
Actually.
I can't believe my podcasting dreams are coming true before my eyes. This is before my ears. I am sorry, Matthew.
There is no conspiracy, I promise. Just to avoid this podcast being canceled, I'm going to maybe avoid stealing another game from you, I think, in this episode.
But you can do what you like because I know that you've secretly agreed to fuck with me.
So no, we have not, I promise you.
Scouts honor.
No. It's just clearly you're picking the best.
Everyone's finally sick of Switzerland. I get it.
There's great chocolate in it. Skin, really good. Tax haven.
It's all good in it, it's Switzerland. Okay. We come to Asher's next pick.
How do I get two?
Yes, because it says Stake Draft, remember?
I can't remember things.
I haven't got any more for you to steal.
That is right, isn't it Matthew?
Yeah, that's right.
Anything left for me to steal from Matthew? Just checking. I'm going to get one steal anyway, don't I?
His dignity.
Yeah, you both use your steal, but you both got kill left.
I'm going to save my kill just in case I need to get revenge on the revenge.
Dig two holes and all that.
You and Ash are thinking the same thing.
All right, well, I'll be careful not to pick some darlings just yet. Okay, I'm going to go Treasure. I feel like Treasure is one that's going to go fast because they don't have that many games in the grand scheme of things.
I'm going to go with Sin and Punishment, an on-rails shooter for N64 kind of in the vein of Lylat Wars, except you're not in a spaceship. You're a little kid kind of running around and jetpacking about. Very, very late era N64 game, pushed the system to its limits, goes crazy like turning the camera upside down, like full 3D madness where sometimes you're not even sure what's going on and you're just like, okay, like cling to this roller coaster, keep shooting, it's all going to be okay.
Absolute thrill ride. It was import only for a long time, Shimomura only came out in Japan, but then eventually came to like Wii Virtual Console as part of the old like Hanabi Festival. I think it's been re-released a few times.
I think it might be on the Switch now as well. Go and play it. It's super cool, looks really brown and muddy because it's an N64 game, but somehow still really impresses.
This game is pretty cool. I quite like any games where you've got stacks of enemies on a platform and you can just blow up the platform and they will just fall to their death. There's just lots of that, so it gets my vote.
It's also just one of those N64 games where you thought, how did they get it running this fast with the hardware? A bit like SOX in that respect. That makes sense.
I thought Treasure was actually pretty good as a pretty good pool of stuff. I think it's tough to pick a bad game out of the bunch, but there's definitely a few well-known games and then the games that are less well-known either. Is it Burger King or McDonald's time?
McDonald's.
Well we've got Dave's picks sorted out anyway, so.
Shhh, don't spoil.
How interesting that Ash would pick sin and punishment when he has clearly sinned and will be receiving punishment in this round.
Amazing. Okay, then it comes back around to me. I'm going to take category 8 Sony Shadow of the Colossus.
Prime candidate for a steal or kill this one, but did want to pick something from the Sony Japan lot that sort of summarizes an era of their games quite well. Yeah, I think what is left of Sony Japan is now basically Team Asobi that makes Astrobot which is also one of the games I shortlisted for this. There are a few actually.
I think they made some cool stuff over the years. But, you know, a monster killing game that still looks fantastic, even if it's an original PS2 form. I flicked it on the other day and was like, Oh dear God, the art direction in this is so good.
It still makes this game look amazing after all these years, while so many of the PS2 games around it have aged like fine milk, such as it is, and, you know, gets darker and weirder the deeper you get into it.
I think you can say very much like this draft.
The magic of replaying this game these days is forgetting exactly which of the colossi is coming next, whether it's like a really, one of the slightly annoying dog ones that are a pain in the arse to kill, or one of the giant ones that really take your breath away, or something in a really strange, isolated location where you're like, what the fuck am I doing here? Or one that just comes out of the sand and is absolutely enormous, and you're there going, how the fuck did they get this running on PS2? Yeah, a game so rich with secrets that people talked about it for, you know, a decade afterwards, and remains a favourite, still great, and it's PS4 remade form from a few years ago by Bluepoint.
Shadow of Colossus is a classic, lads. Matthew, were you thinking about picking this one at all?
Uh, I mean, it's definitely on my long list. Shadow of Colossus, of course, is what both Dave and Ash now reside in, as I stomped furiously about being the Colossus. That one doesn't work as well.
We climbed your back and dealt the deadly blow to the back of your head.
But it's like a co-op version where you both did it.
But little did we know that you were innocent all along.
Damn. It's like an I know what you did last summer film where Matthew comes back a year later to kill everyone.
I know what you did last category.
Well, it does feel like it's been a while since you picked Matthew. So yeah.
Have you picked?
Dave, your next pick, please.
Yeah. I'm not sure where to go with the Shadow of Colossus on my list. I played it again recently because I saw Flow and that kind of cribbed, you ate his aesthetic.
What a fucking great film, by the way. Amazing. Yeah, I can see why it won that Oscar.
Scared the shit out of my five-year-old, though.
It's not a film for children. It's a film for man children, you know? Yeah.
It's just like that cat is in peril constantly, and he was just like terrified for its safety. But it was a you, so I thought it'd be fine. My mistake.
Okay. It's a tricky one knowing that I have a target on my back now. So I've got to kind of pick something that I need to get off the board, but not too good that it gets killed.
There's a bit of ripping the plaster off with all this, isn't there?
Dave, just pick something that you know Matthew absolutely loves, and you don't, then he has to steal it or kill it. Is that a good strategy?
All right. I'll just go with From Software, and I will go Demon's Souls.
Oh, interesting.
I'm mixing things up with that because I love this game. This was my first experience of Souls game. I bought it off of the 10 out of 10 IGN review that Keza wrote.
Yeah, not the 10 out of 10 review that I wrote. Print media in the magazine you worked on.
No. Well, exactly. I did work at it at the time.
You've got two tigers on your back here.
I played the remake of this. I absolutely love it. I think it does almost everything as good and in some cases better than some of the games that came after it from software.
I spent an unreasonable number of hours doing that section where you can be the boss for another player. Invade the players world and be a boss for that level. You know where you're in the library and you're essentially the boss that they have to fight to win to progress and just being an absolute shit and blocking people's progress, being completely leveled up and smashing, just absolutely ruining people's days constantly and constantly.
Matthew knows how this feels. The game is endlessly inventive like that and really is just a testament to Miyazaki and From Software in terms of their ability to create these intricate pain labyrinths that just constantly reward the player for persevering and being playfully malevolent in a way that no other games are. Demon Souls set the template for what would be their defining series beyond that.
But I love it and I think it's my favorite of them all. And the remake was fantastic.
I didn't know that thing about the dungeon where you get to be the boss in it. That's like a classic, amazing FromSoft idea buried in a game probably like 20 or 30 hours into a game that will never play properly. That's always a heartbreaker.
But Ash, you obviously love Demon's Souls and had that kind of breakthrough moment with it when you reviewed it. Anything more you want to say on this one?
Yeah, like this game's got a special place in my heart because I was playing this when it hadn't been released in the UK yet. It had come out in Japan and it had come out in, I think Hong Kong. I think it was like the Hong Kong version I had.
So it was like an Asian version that had English language built in. Oh no, my mate had that. He showed it to me.
I bought the American version. Doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter.
It was an amazing experience to fall in love with that game without knowing anything about it before there had even been any reviews in the wild. It will always be special to me for that reason. And I'm really, really Dave pleasantly surprised that this is your favourite.
I knew you loved Dark Souls. I didn't know that your love went this far back and that it remained your favourite, so I'm quite impressed.
If you liked it so much, why don't you steal this?
He's already got Sekiro, so he can't.
Well, in which case then, speaking of pain labyrinths, we come to Matthew's turn.
Deja vu, I'm picking in category number three, From Software. I'm picking Elden Ring as the From Software game I've played for the second amount of time under Sekiro. Please do not make me go down another notch.
Kill is still left on the menu, lads, just pointed that out.
Someone's going to go home with Dark Souls 2.
Please, I say this, I know by saying it, I open myself up to this, but like, do not, I cannot state how cross I'll be if you force me into the fucking armoured course.
What a load that would be for this podcast.
That would be just, no, anyway, we can't even, no, that won't happen. Elden Ring, oh, I haven't prepped to talk about it because I thought I'd just get Sekiro and that'd be fine. I only played about as much of this as we talked about on the podcast, but I think the sheer size of it does make it maybe a little bit more user friendly in that if you're massively bumping up against something, there's so many other places you can go and there's so many interesting things to find and there's so many kind of boss quality encounters hidden in those little dungeons or just around the world itself and there is something quite magic in seeing something sprout out of nowhere and becoming this quite sort of fully formed experience.
All of a sudden there's a ghost boat fighting you in a forest or I can only remember the ghost boat. So that's my anecdote over. Yeah, Elden Ring.
I find the problem with this game is like I love this game, but it feels like it's like 10 hours too long. Like it gets a little repetitive in its enemies and environments as you sort of climb up the snowy mountains towards the end. And like I felt like you've seen all that needs to be seen.
But until then, it rivaled Demon Souls as like my favorite.
Well, it sounds like you better kill it, Dave, if you've got that much of a problem with it. So something for you to keep in mind.
I feel like I probably should have picked Bloodborne for the heft. But I just can't talk about that. Like that, you know, Elden Ring is more of a heart pick for me because I just bounced off Bloodborne so bad on that first fucking vicar.
So, you know, I'm putting my heart picks out there.
That first fucking vicar, yeah, I get that. I like this game as well. I was playing Elden Ring Night Reign with J.
Bayliss a few weeks ago. And it's nice to be reminded of what a remix it is of all of their different games and all the different enemies. So I was like a boss came up.
There's this mechanic in the game where the sun sets to the end of the day and then you have to fight a boss before the next day can begin. And I was like, oh yeah, I remember fighting this lad in Sekiro. Oh yeah, I remember fighting this lad.
I think I saw this lad in Bloodborne. And there's a pleasant kind of like it's everything that FromSoft has ever done in one giant world out there to experience that does make it. I can see why this became the game that really broke through.
Also, I think they were selling it for about 36 quid at Curry's or something. That's why I ended up buying it. But nonetheless, Matthew, I think that's a very strong pick and probably what I would have picked in this category.
I wasn't expecting this to become a battleground so quickly. But I'll be honest with you, I forgot that From Software Made Sekiro. That's why it wasn't in my shortlist.
Such a fan. Yeah. Idiot, really.
I wasn't there thinking Raven Software made it or something because it's published by Activision, but I just plain forgot. You've got another pick, Matthew.
I have. Do I dare pick something and have it stolen or killed for a lol? Because I feel like that's the narrative that's emerging here.
He's going to be the better man. He's going to keep picking.
I've got to pick good things and hope the listeners stick with me. For Sony, I'm going to take Astro Bot.
Good pick.
My 11th favorite game of 2024. Astro Bot, I may have moaned a little bit about finding it to be a mechanically simplistic platformer. I think maybe that's been challenged, not for me personally, but certainly in its growing speed trial scene and people's obsession with that.
I work with the PlayStation Access people and they are absolutely mad about the time trials and the way people are squeezing microseconds out of just a jump and a jetpack hover suggests that there is more to it than I was feeling. It is just a technologically beautiful thing. Uses the hardware in really fun ways.
One of the best haptics games, one of the best DualSense showcases. Looks absolutely amazing. Anyone who takes those colourful childlike worlds and fills them full of cutting edge physics and what not, the water coming out of a sponge and then cascading down in the correct manner, that stuff is mesmerising.
You'd have to be a real curmudgeon not to be won over by that. Also I just don't have a big emotional connection to Japan Studios, other games from before this. So Astro Bot, actually, I mean, there's loads I like so you can kill it if you want and I'll be fine.
But yeah, just leave it be. Well, you know, it's up to you.
Just leave it be.
Just leave it be. Why don't you leave this one?
I think we'll leave be your like fifth favourite game of the year.
Okay. So Ash, I'd love to know what you think of Astro Bot, because you've probably heard us arguing about it on the podcast a bit, but I'm guessing you've played it. What do you think about it?
Well, yeah, it's amazing. This is the Sony game. When I said earlier, there's another one on my list that wasn't the rapper, the rapper, but I think everyone's going to want it.
This is the one, like, you know, recency bias aside, I think this is the best game Sony Japan have ever made. It's just polished to a sheen, like supremely fun to play, perfect balance between accessibility and like hardcore challenge. Like it runs the entire spectrum of fun.
Full of fan service, you know, it's kind of like Sony's answer to Smash Brothers in that respect. And some really deep cuts. This is the game where I got to the final level and the choice of music playing in the final level, which is from Thunder Force 5, I want to say.
A very kind of hardcore shoot-em-up. I like paused the game and phoned one of my mates to tell him.
Not to tell him about the reference, but to tell him like you need to hurry up, you need to finish Astro Bot, you need to get to the end because you're not going to believe. Like Thunder Force is like his favorite game. So that's why.
There's, you know, fan service in games is one thing and, you know, Astro Bot like throws the kitchen sink at it. Make sure you play the Christmas DLC. There's some Worms content in there.
Team 17 fans. But to have those like such deep cuts in there that it like stops somebody in their tracks and makes them call a mate. I think that's fan service on another level.
On top of just a game that's like amazingly good fun to play like Nintendo quality platforming. And Matthew, I know you don't like that when people say that.
No, it's fine. It's the closest thing to.
It's not like the Donkey Kong has better platforming. It doesn't necessarily. It does other things exceedingly well.
I think that's a good pick, Matthew, even if you do think this game is worse than Mini Shoot Adventures. But that has been long established. You didn't use your kill or steal there, which means you have to wait a while to get your revenge.
I tell you, it comes at the end.
Yeah, okay. The drama is still brewing.
You just have to listen for the reigns of Castamere.
Okay, Dave, what's your next pick?
I'm going to go with Taito. This is a game I played this week. Elevator Action Returns.
Oh, yes.
This is a really fun concept. I mean, I'd never played it before this week. But it's clearly one of the great action games of that era.
Have you played it, Ashley?
Yes, definitely. It's amazing.
Yeah. So you have to extract, for people who don't know, you have to extract Intel from different levels. But basically, it's two things.
You shoot bad guys and you get a bunch of really cool weapons to do it. Then you can jump in and out of elevators going up and down to get to different levels to access different doors with the Intel in. But I mean, it's more than that.
It's just like a game full of really fun explosions. I really like it when people get set on fire, has some really nice animations that make it feel very cinematic despite, you know, the restrictions of the period it's in. You know, it's clearly very influenced by 80s action cinema, kind of does the full sort of gamut of different settings from that era of blockbusters.
For me, the sort of aeroplane terminal level was the highlight. Yeah, it's just a lot of fun. Ash can probably, has probably played it a lot more than me and can speak to it better.
But yeah, it was a great treat to discover this week.
Curiously, this game looks like Tom Francis' Gunpoint.
Yes, it does.
Like it's, okay, I've never really seen another game that looks like it, but because you can see a load of floors at once and what the enemies are doing on different floors, and then they're sort of not aware of you till you turn up, but it does have that Gunpoint look to it. Obviously, with a bit more of an arcade visuals of the time field to it. Anything you want to add on this one, Ash?
I think this is the Donkey Kong 94 of Taito Games in that the original Elevator Actions is this ancient arcade platforming game, very, very simple where you're a little dude going up and down in elevators, shooting guys hiding behind doors, stealing spy stuff and making a getaway, and very limited level designs are just repeated over and over again. Then they get to the 90s and they do the sequel and starts off the same. It's exactly the same level design.
But as soon as you've done that level, Dave will be able to remember this better than me because he's recently played it. But basically, the screen explodes and the scope of the game expands massively until you're in like, I think the second level is like an airport, and you end up in exploring the inside of the aeroplane.
You go through the plane.
Chaos, the best sprite work of its time. It's just like throwing sprites around like nobody's business. At the time, I would have considered this one of the best sequels ever made because it just went so completely over the top in a way.
Like nobody was ever like... No one was going, I want an elevator action sequel. But once you've played it, you're like, oh my god, yeah, we needed this in our lives.
Amazing game.
Good pick, Dave.
Shout out to Reddit who recommended it.
Yeah, I appreciate you doing the deep dive on this because I think that this was definitely the hardest category to research.
Yeah, it's also like for us, as I say, we're a bit younger than Ash. So a lot of this stuff passed us by. So we don't have like a sort of personal connection to it.
But it is fun to sort of dive into the archives and sort of check stuff out.
You can get this on the Switch. It's like six pounds or something. It's dirt cheap.
So it's technically the Sega Saturn version, but Sega Saturn version is really good. Like I would encourage everyone to go play it.
Curious Stage, you've got many backups for this category. Just apropos of nothing.
I do. I do. I made sure.
Space Invaders. First one. It's really good.
Okay.
That is a legit pick, by the way. Don't shit on Space Invaders, mate.
Well, I mean, you know, anyway, I'm just making fun, Dave.
Yeah. Yeah.
Pick that. But I imagine the effervescent Space Invaders will potentially come up if someone were to kill this pick or take it.
Did I say effervescence once?
No, you didn't. I was just joking. Okay.
So right then, next pick is me. Maybe I'll just take my Taito game now too. Will I do that?
No, fuck it. I'll take my Namco game. Category 4.
Let's take Ridge Racer Type 4, which I think will be a hot ticket. This is a good candidate for Matthew's kill or steal because I know he has also played it for a past draft where he selected it. I think it's a PS1 draft actually, Matthew.
This is super exciting, beautifully presented arcade style racing game on PS1 with the most beautiful menus you've ever seen. But super, super playable. It looks absolutely incredible even to this day, and still incredibly playable even if you weren't well versed in the Gran Turismo's of that era.
It's very, very pick up and play. Am I picking this because the menus look so, so nice that it elevates the feel of the experience. It's definitely part of what sets this one apart from the other Ridge Racer games on this system.
But it's a PS Vita, download it and check it out classic. It's one of those games where you're like, well, people hyped this up but they made fucking loads of them. I guess like Tekken also fits this category a little bit where you're like, well, how excited can I get about this after all these games and after all this time?
But definitely a standout racing game from that system. Feels like it will complement my other picks well. I don't see myself picking another racing game, but there's potentially other genres from the Namco fold that might come up.
So felt like the right fit. Any thoughts on this?
Yeah, I love this, in my opinion, the best Ridge Racer. I'm really happy that there's a racing game in this draft because Japan does racing games very, very well. The night driving in Ridge Racer 4 is astounding.
Such a primitive system for them to capture the beauty of racing at night and the way the lighting works in that kind of pixely 3D form. There's an artistry to it that you can't really capture with realistic visuals. It's something really special and it hasn't aged.
Yeah, which is a lot of PS1 games definitely feel like they have. So it feels like a dependable pick in that respect. Then we come back to you, Ash.
You got two picks.
Oh, gosh. Let me just remind myself what Matthew's picked.
I just can't. Just let me have some picks, please.
I've got some good Taito picks, but we've had some Taito, so I'm going to mix it up. I'm going to go Konami, and I'm going to go Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
Definitely on my short list.
You know, this is... It's not where Metroidvania has come from, but it's certainly where the term comes from. You know, this was Konami reinventing the kind of action platforming of Castlevania in the Metroid style, doing it on PlayStation when everyone was moving to 3D, and they were like, no, fuck that.
We're going to make the best 2D game of all time with like hours and hours of exploration, secrets to find. Put these glasses on to see what the boss is really doing so you can get past him, finish it, but oh no, the castle's upside down and you've got to do the whole thing again. Just like endless inventiveness and surprises.
I think this is a game you can return to literally decades later and still find something you've never seen before, still have a great time, a true masterpiece of a game.
I played this for the PS1 draft that I lost when I picked this, even though it is phenomenal. I think I got more than halfway through the non-upside down castle bit, Ash. I was really impressed by it.
Actually, I don't know how much this is added with the subsequent re-releases, but the way that it would use little bits of 3D here and there, just to remind you of what the system can do.
Yeah, like the 3D coffin and the save points, that's got nice little flourishes to it, yeah.
Were you tempted to pick any of the other Castlevania games, Ash, like Rondo of Blood or anything like that?
I mean, I absolutely love the Castlevania series, but no, this was the only one on my list.
What is Dave Scarborough, a miserable pile of secrets? I say it often. So good pick for sure, definitely on my shortlist.
Ash, your next pick.
I'm going to go Square Enix, where I'm assuming you can pick a Square Game, an Enix game or a Square Enix game.
I did wonder if someone might say you should have had a category for each of them, but I thought an Enix game might be a reach. Should they want Dave playing fucking Dragon Quest 4 in a week or whatever?
I mean, I do love Enix, but my favorite Square Game, maybe I shouldn't say it's my favorite. Matthew's watching me. I can see.
I like that everyone has to pretend to be incredibly disinterested in things like that. Yeah, I guess you could have Symphony of the Night.
You're so dangerous, though, Matthew. You're in a really privileged position because Ash and I are both terrified of whatever we pick is going to be the thing that gets stolen. So I'm moving very cautiously around the board.
I should add as well that we're in Google Meets and Matthew's avatar is this like wide-eyed, unblinking stare, like piercing my soul.
Deer in the headlights.
It looks like if Matthew had a Channel 4 sitcom in the noughties and they put out the DVD of Season 1, like that's what his picture looks like.
That's my O&M headshot that I take to the barbers.
What a great lore reveal.
It looks like a ventriloquist dummy of Matthew.
Absolutely amazing content today. So this is a game on the Super Nintendo that I played over one summer with my mate Richard. It is a multiplayer RPG called Secret of Mana.
It dates back to when not a lot of RPGs came to the UK, but for some reason this one did. I guess it was maybe a little bit easier to localise or whatever because it's not knee-deep in text. Had a great time playing this action RPG in two-player co-op mode.
It's technically three-player, but who had a multi-tap and who had that many friends? Not me. I didn't have a single extra friend.
Incredible pixel art. Probably, I'm going to say, the best video game soundtrack of all time. I once spent most of a holiday in Japan visiting every single music shop I could find looking for the CD soundtrack and did find it.
It felt like I'd struck gold when I found it. It means that much to me, this game. Please don't kill it.
Seriously, please do not kill it.
It sounds like he wants it to be killed.
Well, I don't know. I think he does protest too much, you know? I think you're trying to mislead me on this one.
Maybe. Any of you guys played this?
No. I feel like I always should have done. And it feels like this series constantly comes back in slightly unconvincing 3D forms, whereas the original is just the one that everyone says is still the best one.
Would I get the most out of it playing it by myself, Ash?
It's much, much better in multiplayer, so I would try to do that if possible. There is a remake of it on the PlayStation 4, which has absolutely garbage graphics by comparison. We got rid of all that lovely pixel art and made it just, you know, generic 3D polygons.
It's not the easiest game to go back to. It's really grindy. You've got AI teammates who have bad pathfinding and start like brushing up against the walls and you have to like wind back around to where you started to get them to follow you again.
I think it'd be like really frustrating for a newcomer to play now. But at the same time, it probably still is the best in the series. It's a strange thing.
Quite a lot of nostalgia at play in my choice.
Makes sense. Don't worry if Matthew kills this, you can always take Terranigma in free pick. I'm sure that will have the same impact.
We come around to me then. Let's take my Scronix game, and I'm going to take Final Fantasy IX. Bit different, but I wanted to pick something that hadn't been drafted before.
I think when we did the PS1 draft, Matthew took seven and I took eight. But I thought this time I would shamelessly pander to the people who always bang on about this being the best one. They're not correct, but it is good.
It's very much in the traditional Final Fantasy mold in terms of the world. It's a very trad sort of fantasy world, but it has a very cheeky sort of adventurous spirit to it in some ways, with this undercurrent of darkness at the same time. It gets a little bit of a kind of Princess Bride feel to bits of it.
It's certainly less weighty and teenage angsty than FF7, and particularly AR. Even though I think that it's a little bit more conservative when it comes to combat and leveling up, it's beloved because it really made the most out of the PS1's limitations. Everyone always shares that image of Squall at the dance in Final Fantasy 8.
As you say, you're the best-looking guy here, and it's just a squiggle of lines. The PS1 tries to render his spiky hair and teenage head. I can't quite pull it off.
This has a bit more of the big head, stylized cartoonish designs that suit it very well. Still a very handsome-looking game, obviously. I think actually the interesting thing is that this game was mostly made in Hawaii by developers who I assume no longer work at Square Enix.
I guess I can't really say the way on that one, but it was in that period where Sakaguchi went off to make The Spirits Within and opened a Square Soft studio in Hawaii and so this was one of the things that they worked on. Very handsome game, frequent rumours it's going to be remade, but felt like something that I think is a cool pick, but maybe not quite as tantalising to kill or steal as some other picks. It was between this or Chrono Trigger for me.
Who knows if this gets stolen? I've got plenty of Square games to pick anyway. There's loads of good Final Fantasy games, so it feels like a low-risk category anyway in that respect, but yeah, nine.
There it is.
I've played about 20 minutes of this because I needed to get a clip from the beginning for a video for access. All I know is that it's got a terrible skipping rope minigame in it, but that's basically it. I know I've got to play this.
Maybe I'll eventually get round to it after I finish disc three of Final Fantasy 7 some point in 2028. But yeah, until then, I'll take your word for it.
I guess we'll see how it goes. But yeah, Ash, I'm guessing you've not played this one.
I played the Switch version when that came out. I didn't play it for very long. Am I right in thinking this is the one that had lots of references back to the classic era of Final Fantasy?
I've got lots of fan service for the first six entries, but those references were literally lost in the translation.
Entirely possible. But I mean, the visual references are really obvious, like what VV looks like and all of the different characters and the races that are kind of featured in it. It's very different to 7 and 8 in that respect.
Moved away from sci-fi back towards the fantasy tropes in the original games. But I think that would be... If this remake ever materialises, I would definitely play it and I would hope there would be a new translation I'd like to pick up on some of those things that are supposedly missing from the PS1 version.
Arguably the best way to play this, I guess like minus the quality of life things, like speeding up the battles, which is pretty essential in some ways. But there's a mod called the Maguri Mod, I think it is, that HDs up everything in the game. I don't think it's made with AI or anything.
I think it's all human, handcrafted, but every single model in the game and that kind of thing has had a facelift with it and you can install that on Steam Deck. It keeps the original fonts and all that stuff. So a handsome fan project indeed.
Dave, I won't ask you about FF9 because...
I absolutely spaced out. I just started thinking about what I was going to eat for dinner tomorrow.
Don't worry, mate. I wasn't asking what you thought of it. I was going to say it's your next turn, so it's okay.
You don't even have to flub it. You can just go straight into it, mate. It's all good.
Hey, I held my hands up. I know it's a blind spot for me.
What will you be having for dinner tomorrow, by the way?
I've got pork chops with bone marrow butter.
Sounds good. It sounds like a fucking Henry VIII did it to me.
But that's your final supper.
The last supper.
OK, Dave, what's your next pick?
I'm going to go Capcom and I'm going to go Resident Evil 7, which is probably the most recent game anyone's picked here. Oh no, Elden Ring is. But for me, this is my favorite Resident Evil game.
This is sort of Resident Evil doing elevated horror. This is the first time playing a Resident Evil game where I felt actively scared and tense throughout. Like, it was just edgy as C, white knuckle gameplay, even from like the demo they released, the VR thing, like pitch perfect marketing for this as sort of a reboot to the franchise.
And like it kind of lets in the sort of sillier action stuff later on, you know? But for me, this is as big a leap for the franchise as Resident Evil 4 was after 3 and the various spin-offs and stuff. This really took it to a new level, setting it in sort of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre style, like house where you're being stalked around by the crazy owners as you just try to escape.
I know like the franchise always sort of had a Western feel, but this felt very, this felt much more influenced by the sort of 70s grind house horror prevalent in America at the time. Only this and Alien Isolation have I had to play with my eyes closed in sections and just push forward on the analogue stick, just like assuming something was going to jump out and scare the shit out of me. Like it was that intense an experience for me.
But yeah, I think this is as good as Resident Evil has ever got.
I like this pic because I don't have to kill it, because with that boat section and mine section it kills itself.
Yeah, that is a weak spot, but like in the same criticism I've been able to read, everything up to that point is so good that you can kind of forgive it.
I don't even really remember big chunks of this game now. I just remember thinking it starts as a sort of like, oh, back to basics, we all know you complained about Resi 6, so taking all the gunplay away, then by the end you're shooting blob monsters.
Yeah, Chris Redfield turns up.
Yeah, he just goes, I'm Redfield and the game ends, which is quite confusing. And Village is, I think, a better game. I think it, I personally think it's like a high 7, and the Village is probably a low 8, but, you know, it's very popular.
I just, I honestly think this is like a complete gear shift for them, and arguably you just like, arguably obviously, because we're all debating it here, I don't think you've got a better first 10 hours of a Resi game than you do than 7.
I've got to say, I've got you back on this, Dave. I think this is a remarkable game. I really admire in the Resident Evil series that Resident Evil keeps evolving and takes giant kind of left turns every few games, and 7 along with 4 is one of those moments.
It's genuinely scary, which Resident Evil games often are not. They're more kind of fun or thrilling. But this is scary.
This is like you are scared to move forwards.
Whenever Ash praises one of Dave's picks, I feel like he's just trying to get like the kill target on his back. Like he's just buttering it up for the slaughter, being like, oh yeah, what an awesome game, what a winning game.
I would steal this if I had a steal left, Matthew.
The funny thing is, I think this is, it did do exactly what Capcom wanted it to do. It did restore Rezi's reputation as a survival horror favorite. I don't think it's the best flavor of Rezi.
Arguably, this is like one of the first in the mega hot streak of Capcom games that kicked off in the last 10 years. This is certainly like a key moment in that, and I do like that they've partitioned off the main Rezi's games in first person from the remakes and third person. That's just been good for everyone involved, because it means we get more games, it's been a slightly different style.
But yeah, I don't get the most excited about it, but I definitely think it did its job at the time. Okay, so we come to two picks from podcasting legend, Matthew Castle.
For pick number nine, Taito. I'm going to take Space Invaders Extreme on DS.
Very good.
There was like a wave of re-imaginings that kind of punched up classic sort of arcade formats with shiny neon graphics and trance-y music and sometimes some weird rule flips. Feels like Pat-Man Championship Edition kind of ushered this in. I guess a bit like a proto-Tetris effect.
This is kind of that vibe. Occasionally uses both screens of the DS for like a long stretchy Space Invaders, but for the most part does contain it to one screen. If I remember correctly, it has like a gimmick where you kind of go off and you get given like a little task, a little very sort of short, sharp task to complete.
And if you do it, it activates like crazy fever mode or whatever it's called. Space Invaders is just such a like a rock solid golden idea. Very sort of hypnotic, very nice cycle you can slip into.
So just taking that and kind of punching it up into something a bit more fizzy. That feels good to me.
Yeah, it makes sense. It's nice to have that, you know, the very earliest days of video games represented in here. So that makes sense, Matthew.
What's your next pick?
My next pick is... Konami again. I'll take Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater.
I see.
Which don't leave it alone.
I just, I know I can see it. I can, I can, I can feel it in Sam's...
The problem is when you take something like that, then you're kind of asking for it a bit, aren't you? Because...
I've already...
People don't have the kids to use.
There's loads of other good games.
Yeah, but there's only like, you know there's only two canonical Metal Gears that you and I are extremely fond of. So, you know, I...
You like four?
No, you know that's not, you know that's bullshit. Perhaps the first one, but, yeah, I don't know. Anyway, speak on it.
Well, listen, I mean, if you want to fucking waste your steel on this, I mean, that's crazy to me. That's crazy. I mean, this is a great game.
It's no Metal Gear Solid 5, which I obviously picked the first time round.
You could take Ground Zeroes.
Oh, God, this is such a bad hang. The idea of having to give up Phantom Bones for Ground Zeroes is so grim.
That's tough.
Snake Eater, yeah, more of the old school 3D Metal Gear before it becomes like this complete sandbox, but still very, very free to behave how you want. But with much more of a kind of hand on the narrative rudder from Kojima, giving you all the kind of crazy boss fights, big story twists, the very kind of scripted narrative moments, climbing the ladder, the sniper fight with the end, etc. Like a game that serves up a classic set piece or a memorable idea, every 20 minutes, there's a reason this is the one they chose to remake coming out in a couple of weeks or maybe by the time this episode is out.
Either way, it's an absolutely killer adventure. If Sam wants to steal this or kill this or whatever, then no one else can steal anything else. So I'm happy to defang him like a snake grabbed in the grass.
There you go.
Well, like, why pick this so early? It is early. It's like we've got about half the picks to go still.
You could have left this till last, so you're guaranteed not to have it stolen anyway. It could also be killed, remember, as well. So it's not like it's just me who's weighing in the long grass like the animals in this game, Matthew.
It's a rich metaphor. I'm sure you'll agree. OK, well, obviously a great game, an all time classic, and discussed many times in this podcast, did a whole episode of it two years ago.
I think then we'll breeze on to Dave's next pick.
Square Enix, Kingdom Hearts.
All right.
I got so much shit for picking Kingdom Hearts 2 over Kingdom Hearts last time, so I'm correcting that this time by picking the original Kingdom Hearts, which obviously set the template for the whole franchise and sort of got there before it became too much convoluted mess narratively. Like it's a relatively sort of restrained selection of sort of Disney IPs that it travels to, but it's a great set with, you got Halloween Town, Atlantica, I've been getting stuck in Atlantica for ages with the stupid tunnel with like some waves coming down it that I couldn't pass. But anyway, you got Agrabah, you go to Winnie the Pooh in this one as well, right?
The thing is, as I sort of pointed out earlier, I'm a little allergic to Final Fantasy RPGs, but this gives me enough of sort of the IP fanservice-y stuff that I need to get over that hump for it to be enjoyable for me. And I think it's so novel, and it was such a unique and weird collaboration at the time and even today. The fact that it still continues on baffles me.
But yeah, I think this is just such an interesting visual mishmash of sort of games, Final Fantasy, and like a major IP. I just found it very endearing, and yeah, I do really like these games, so I'm picking it.
Dave's new drafting strategy, mid-pick so no one steals or kills his games.
Look at you pick this last time!
I can't win.
I will say though, Square Enix, toughest category for me, for sure.
Yeah, it's, if you don't like RPGs, it's tough in there really.
Kingdom Hearts is great, and it's, it, like, it is.
Oh, I should have took Nier Automata in that category. Fucked it. Anyway.
I thought, by our rules, it wouldn't, it wouldn't, because it wasn't made in-house.
Would it count as a free pick to you, though, Matthew, under, under Platinum?
Yeah, I think so, because it's made by Platinum.
Something to think about, anyway. Kingdom Hearts, then, Dave. I mean, I like this game a lot, and particularly think that the dreamy oddness of the story in places is what sets us apart.
It does definitely disappear into a sort of mountain of lore, but it's quite strange and unknowable in places as the first one. It's sort of like a kid's adventure with a bit of darkness to it. I think it's good, a good use of the license, and I still don't really know why it exists.
It feels like it should fail every single brand guideline you can imagine, but nonetheless, it has thrived. Okay, it comes back around to me. I guess I will also take Taito and get that out of the way.
I had a couple of games for this, but I will take Parcel Bobble 3, aka Buster Move 3, a series I discovered in a French arcade when I was on a camping holiday in the late 90s or early noughties. It was ported to PS1. This is kind of around the era that a lot of these games start coming to Europe.
Buster Move is probably more familiar to our listeners than Puzzle Bobble, I imagine. Basically a game of firing little bubbles at each other, colour matching them to score points. Very compelling.
I thought about it recently when playing the demo for Ball Pit, the game discussed on our Excel episode that's going to be a game of the year contender. It has a release date of October, which is very exciting. It was this or G Darius, the PS1 shoot-em-up, which I'm very fond of how strange it looks in places, the way it uses the 3D art of the PS1 in that kind of side-scrolling form.
A lot of nice looking shoot-em-ups on that console with that very particular aesthetic. But this is a game that's like a banging puzzle classic with a sort of arcade urgency to it. Just a really evergreen kind of game.
What do you think of this one, Ash? What are you thinking about it as well?
Yeah, well, Puzzle Bobble, the original one was top of my list for Taito. I'm not going to take Puzzle Bobble when you've taken Puzzle Bobble 3. That would be boring.
I cannot put into words, which is a shame because I have to do, like how great a game Puzzle Bobble is. I think it's a game like anyone can play. My three-year-old girl plays Puzzle Bobble loads and she's been playing it since she was under two years old.
Because it's so simple. You just got these big, bright bubbles. You aim, you fire, they pop.
It's like viscerally satisfying to do, but also the strategy is there if you want it. It is the best title game, in my opinion.
It's funny. You obviously picked three. Ash had one.
I had two on my list, which was my backup game. This was a classic Dave Scarborough bin bag game. And by that, I mean my dad turned up one day with a bin bag full of games for my PlayStation, just pulled them out in front of me.
And this was part of it. And so, you know, of like the six or seven games that would be in there, like a couple of them may be good. And of those couple, you ended up playing them for like 50 hours because you had nothing else.
It's funny that your games came out of a bin bag, Dave, because I think Matthew is going to send them home in a body bag.
Well, it's, there's a bit of a CX Energy summer days fix, I will say that. Now I'm just being a dick for no reason. Yeah, it's-
What's that even mean? Yeah, I don't know, they all do really. It's definitely in that top tier of this sort of like sub-genre of colour matching puzzle game with like Puzzle Fighter Turbo and Dr. Robotnik's Bean Bean Machine, I guess.
Yeah, put your P on.
Nice.
Yeah, put your P on. So yeah, it's definitely in that kind of like tier. But yeah, it's an all-timer, a great...
And like I say, I did authentically discover this as an arcade, not the third one, but the first one in an arcade cabinet in the wild back in the day. So I definitely had fond memories of it before I picked it up again this week and was like, oh yeah, this is incredibly playable still. There was a version of it made for Switch a few years ago.
So it's still around in different forms. OK, we come back to Ash for two picks.
So I'm going to go Capcom Street Fighter 2. I mean, it's Street Fighter 2, legendary game. It defined a genre.
It is the game, I would say, in my life. This is the game where I went from liking games to being obsessed with them. Before Street Fighter, you know, the Commodore 64 in the house, I'd play on it if it was raining outside.
After Street Fighter, it got a Mega Drive and it's just like all I wanted to do, just me and my brother fighting each other in Street Fighter 2 and always felt like there was a lot to learn even in, you know, it's quite a primitive game by modern standards now, but there was like tons to learn because of the special moves. It like, it always felt like you were never gonna reach the skill ceiling on this game. You could always get better at it.
And I think that's part of the appeal and a little bit part of the like intimidation of fighting games now in that, you know, if that skill skill ceiling feels really high, you might feel like you're never gonna get there. But Street Fighter 2 was perfectly pitched, I think. So like anyone can have a good time with it.
That's a very solid pick. And I did think about this series, but couldn't authentically draft it with any real authority. I'm sure it's one of those series that if I put a summer into getting into it, I'd probably really love it because it sort of like is so compatible with all the other types of games that I like.
But nonetheless, I'm happy to leave it to the experts.
Okay. I'm going to go Nintendo. Do I go head or heart?
Go.
I think I'm going to go heart. And I'm going to go with what to me was known as Lylat Wars, but to everyone else, called Star Fox 64.
This was definitely on my short list, actually.
Was it? Oh, cool. Yeah.
This is probably my favorite Nintendo game. Fantastic shoot-em-up. Easily the best Star Fox game, but that's not saying much.
It's had a bit of a muddled track record, to be honest. But to put it another way, this is the one where they nailed it. They got it absolutely right.
Like the atmosphere, the mechanics, everything. Just a really supremely playable 3D on-rails shooter. Packed full of secrets.
There were certain things you could do in the levels that would take you off on a completely divergent route to a new boss that you hadn't seen before, which would then open up a route through the game to a completely new level that you hadn't seen before. So you could play through the whole thing in, I don't know, like 45 minutes or something. It's got that kind of arcade quality to it.
But the next time you came back to it and played it, you could take a completely different route through the game, find little secrets. It was almost like a Star Wars film that you could play and was different every time. I still love playing it today.
I think it's amazing.
It's a banger, isn't it? And Matthew, I've not asked you for a while what you thought of the games, actually. What do you think of this one?
It's not a series that means as much to me as it clearly does to you. I didn't feel particularly wounded when subsequent ones weren't as good, but yeah, this was good. I really like the 3DS version, the pairing with the 3D graphics.
That was really nicely made. Also, I think one of these games that sometimes got dinged for being short in a superficial way, obviously it has always hidden depths, and I just feel like there's a bigger appetite for that kind of game now than there might have been when it originally came out. The 3DS one could be a bit more cleanly received, I guess.
I actually do disagree with Matthew on this. I think this is top tier Nintendo, and here's why, because I think if you're going to play an N64 game now, this would be number one for sure for me to pick up and play these days on the entire platform. I wouldn't pick a Zelda or a Mario over this.
I would pick this because it is just so pick up and play. It's still pretty responsive. It still looks nice.
I do think the 3DS version is the way to experience it.
Unlike some of those other series, it's never been bettered.
I don't think the series is top tier Nintendo, but I think the game is, if that makes sense. It's just so play. It's like the perfect version of what it is.
Yeah, I think that's why it fulfills that criteria for me. But nonetheless, yeah, good pick, Ash. We're all very impressed, apart from Matthew, who deems it second tier Nintendo.
Second tier Nintendo is still better than most people's top tier.
Fair enough. Okay, it comes back around to me then. And predictably, following the last round, I actually had so many games for this category, but let's do free pick, Category 11.
I am going to take Nier Automata. It's got the whiff of a draft winner about it to me. A real kind of like one-off in the sense that it's an action RPG that uses the platinum kind of core action mechanics to give the game a bit of like credibility on the hack and slash side, but then layers in loads of strange sci-fi storytelling about sad hot androids on a planet where they're supposed to be clearing it out of insane robots so the humans can come back to it and colonize it.
But the reality behind what's going on and how that's unearthed bit by bit across the course of the game, well it just it takes you to some real places. I think I found this insufferably stylish when I first started playing it, listening to the weird kind of like, sort of like circus music that plays when you go to that bit of the map and you're like, please shut the fuck up. I don't care about any of these robots who think they're people who gives a fuck.
And then at some point, it just clicks and you're like, oh, this is actually amazing. It's sort of like, it's similar to my relationship with watching something like Evangelion, where I'm like, I find this so irritating and try to push through the tropes of what the, of what anime is to get to the sort of like sci-fi heart of it that is, that really sort of like, you know, sort of gets you emotionally. And I think, I went on a similar journey with this where I eventually clicked with it and once I did, I thought it was absolutely phenomenal.
Somehow still doesn't have a sequel after eight years? I mean, crazy. I don't know how that's even possible.
I assume it wasn't caught in any of the recent sort of Square Enix maneuvering that's been going on because it's just sold too many copies this game to be caught in there. But yeah, near-automata, in it goes. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, it's a great game for all the reasons you say. It still really holds up. If anything, because it looks nice, but it's not like the most cutting edge of games and because of that, I actually think it has a slightly weirdly timeless quality.
Going back to this recently for, again, some video capture, I was just struck with, doesn't really look old or new. And I like the weird ass music, but I think I'm more open to pretentious circus things than you are. Have you seen Cirque du Soleil?
I have.
No, I reviewed a Cirque du Soleil Blu-ray for HD Review about 15 years ago and gave it two stars.
Two stars.
Tough for Cirque du Soleil. I apologize to the French. I do like the Wailing Lady music most of the time, and this game has ended up being one of the most influential games.
I mean, we talked about Stellar Blade. That's definitely a game that is built... Yeah.
That game wouldn't exist without this game.
It's one of the most influential games, but also nothing its influence has come like sort of anywhere near to it, really.
No, but yeah, it's one of those quietly influential ones as well. Yeah, really interesting. Okay, thank you for validating that.
That's all right. That is a good one. I am tempted by that.
Well, you know, that's what the steel function is for.
I feel like in my head, I've got such crazy like main character energy going on, where I just assume everything is about to like put me off or like mislead me in some way. It's actually driving me insane.
Well, I think it's even just for, that's just not the case here. I mean, I think this category alone, I had, I mean, this wasn't even in my like main picks for it. Let's see what I have.
I had Bomberman 94 was my main pick for this and then Rez and then Bayonetta. So, just chucking those out in case Sam wants to pick those.
Like I hear two people going nuts for Lion at Wars and I'm like, I don't know, feels like bait.
What's your next pick, Dave?
I'm going to go Treasure. I'm going to go Gunstar Heroes, which was another game that I played this week. Again, this is going to be one that Ash has more of a history with.
I don't know if anyone else has played it.
AKA Ash can do the talking for this one because I don't have enough to fill the time.
It's a cool action shooter with lots of set pieces and boss battles. Starts off with two guys in sunglasses on what looked like the big machine from The Incredibles that you have to blow up. Then it goes into an elevator shaft with lots of other giant machines you have to fight and then you end up on a helicopter.
No, not on a helicopter. You're on a plane, aren't you? Fighting another big bad guy.
It's just one of those great lessons in gameplay escalation, where everything just gets bigger and more explosive as you go along. And yeah, it's great fun. It's like a very impressive mix of like really fast placed gameplay and lots of combat, both melee and with guns and stuff.
And I had a really good time playing it.
The title screen music is an absolute banger. I often listen to it on YouTube. I can't steal it, but this was what I wanted.
A great game. It's a game that you and I both played, Matthew. And I don't think of this as a bullet hell game in the same way as I do with some of the Treasures other games.
But I do think of this as a game that's got the amazing animations and sprite art. We talked about this with Star Fox, but for the Mega Drive, this is one of the games I would play now on the system for sure. So I think it's a good pick.
I don't think it's hard to go wrong with Treasure more generally, Dave, but I think it's a good pick. Ash, what do you think of this one?
Yeah, I had this on the Mega Drive back in the day. Loved it. It was Treasures' first game, really.
This and McDonald's Land were made at the same time, but yeah, this is the first one. And a lot of the ideas that are in it, they kind of persisted into later games. The way you'd combine different buttons together to change what the weapons are, like that's in Radiant Silvergun years later.
Endlessly inventive. There's an entire level that's kind of based inside a board game, and this giant dice rolls and changes what happens in the level. So it's kind of an amazing idea in the Mega Drive era to feel like the game was dynamically changing.
I think it's an amazing calling card for a new developer, particularly back in those days. You get new developers and new IPs all the time now with the indie scene, but back then, this developer to come out of nowhere, the ex-Konami dudes, and they took everything they'd learned from Konami in terms of awesome arcade action and gone, right, we're going to amp it up to the next level, everything is going to be up to 11, and we're going to be really inventive. One of the greatest debuts of all time.
Yeah, can't fault it, great pick.
Good stuff. All right then, Matthew, Two Picks.
Two Picks.
Two Picks Castle, they call him.
That's right. Well, let's round out Treasure. Well, for now, unless anyone starts killing games in there, which would be an insane thing to do, I think.
McDonald's adventure it is.
I'll take Bangio for this.
Really?
I'm going to use Matthew's catchphrase, people love it.
People do love it. It's the game we get to fire like eight billion missiles and see their little trails around. Yeah, I think this is quite different from them.
I assume you are the one of the things that I've played and liked. Yeah, I won't be shaking on that. I think this is solid to play a little robot, fly around 2D levels, crazy amount of projectiles, and the little kind of particle effects that follow them.
Just make it look really, really busy. I think Bangio is fine. I don't think Treasure's winning or losing this draw for anyone personally.
Probably not, but you're just too fucking tiny on the screen in this, I think. Ashwood, how do you respond to that criticism?
That's part of the appeal, though, because the ship and the particles are so tiny, it means they can cram loads onto the screen. You play this game on a big television, it just looks amazing to see all that shit.
Can you tell them, Ash?
It's great.
I played this on Matthew's telly last year, and I still had to fucking glean in. That TV is gigantic. How are people playing this on a CRT?
Well, it's designed for a CRT, so if you're playing it on a HDTV, that might have been part of the problem, but that's by the by. Did you play the DS version, Matthew?
Yes, I did play the DS version.
Do you remember, you could make your own levels and you could share them, but you shared them by... It made an audio file that you then had to play into another DS's microphone.
Mic, that's right, yeah.
And I spent ages loading up these level audio files on YouTube and holding up my DS to the computer. And it never worked. It never once worked.
So I wondered if you had a better experience than that.
No, I can't say I fully experimented with that.
Quite a niche concern, that one.
Now, I just want to play random sound effects into the DS and see what levels come out the other end. I'm going to play the entirety of this draft in there and see what happens. Comes out with the worst fucking level anyone's ever seen in any video game.
There's like some Milo Rambaldi shit that is, playing some music into a DS to unlock some. But I mean, that's just ridiculous, really. I need you to appreciate the reference, Matthew.
What's your next pick?
Let's go, let's go Namco, which this, for me, this was the category which did like the least amount for me. Like I just don't have a huge connection to any of their stuff. But I'm going to take Katamari Damacy for this.
Oh, right. Good pick.
Yeah, I'm purely on the ground of like, I have played it. It is very enjoyable. It's very oddball.
Got an absolutely killer soundtrack. Whenever we have this in an episode, it often gets used as the music in the break, just because the soundtrack is really, really good. Yeah, you play the little man pushing around objects into a ball.
Smaller objects become bigger objects, become the biggest objects. It's all about cleaning the levels out and laughing at all the... Is it unfair to say slightly ropey 3D models of all these objects?
It's part of its charm, I guess.
Highly stylized, let's say.
Stylized.
Yeah, let's say stylized. It's not a series I've followed enough to go and say, I don't know if there is considered the best of the bunch, but there let's go with the original, just because that's when it breaks through.
I think that's a solid pick and people seem to all agree that the original was the best at the time anyway. Can't speak to any of the new ones that they've been working on or whatever. You know, I'm surprised you didn't pick Nobby Nobby Boy for this category, Matthew, but we do what we can.
There's enough Nobby Nobby Boys on this podcast.
Four Nobby Nobby Boys picked the best games by Japanese, All-Star Japanese game developers.
You got the title for the episode.
That's too niche, even for our Mr. Ship. Okay, let's move on then to Dave's next pick.
I mean, none of us are doing Kill. You two both have your steals. It's kind of weird to me.
I hadn't realized.
You haven't stolen anything, have you?
No, no, I haven't.
You were circling, you were teasing on MGS3. Maybe in your mind you'd already stolen it.
Well, I'm sort of worried about using it and Matthew thinking that we did genuinely sort of team up on it.
No, you can honestly, you can use it however you want. That's podcasting, baby.
Look at this, he's trying to be kind now, Samuel.
I thought you were holding off because I was laying out such a good suite of temptations.
Interestingly, if Samuel does steal from Matthew, one of us is that immune from a kill. No, two of us are immune from a kill. You've only got one kill.
It's like something from a fucking point and click adventure game that is. Okay, so, but we can worry about that later. We're on Dave's next pick.
I'm going to go in free pick. I'm going to take your choice that you didn't go with, which is Bomberman 94. This was top of my list.
When you think back to that sort of era of multiplayer experiences, Bomberman is just absolutely top for me. This is just such addictive, competitive gameplay. And as I've sort of said on other Drafts in the Pod, I am, if nothing else, a very competitive person.
And a lot of the games that sort of were formative for me were based around sort of trying to beat my friends in sort of couch multiplayer modes, whether it's like Micro Machines, Bomberman or Mario Kart, whatever it may be, GoldenEye. But Bomberman is just, it's a great combination of strategy and also just sort of like, much like this podcast, like full of delicious revenge and sort of just being an absolute shit to other people. Just a beautiful, simple, perfect multiplayer game for me.
Any reason you've gone for the 94 version, Dave?
I had Super Bomberman 2 or Bomberman 94. I mean, they're sort of interchangeable. I had Mega Drive, so 94 was sort of more authentic to my upbringing.
Mega Bomberman, as it was known here?
Yes, that's why I went with that one.
Yeah, John Madden's Bomberman 94, it was called originally. And then they changed it. No, it's not.
I love Bomberman 94. I had this on the Mega Drive. It was the best Mega Drive game I had that didn't have Sonic in it.
It was phenomenal in multiplayer. It had quite an interesting and flawed single-player game with some very strange boss battles and odd little worlds to explore, fun minecart mechanics, and some of the maps and the different ways they would play with it, like teleporting areas and areas that just killed you straight away, trap doors and blocks that you could easily move and the power-ups that would make you super fast or would make your bombs huge in size or lays loads of bombs at once. Such a thrilling sense of danger and excitement in the multiplayer of this, genuinely an all-timer.
And I think even, sorry, Ash, you might remember this at Imagine. I think there was a bit of a spate of bringing back a GameCube Bomberman game.
Yeah, there was an absolutely brutal kind of Bomberman scene at Imagine. The same people who would destroy you at Street Fighter would happily destroy you at Bomberman as well.
Yeah, phenomenal stuff. I think it's a great pick, Dave.
Yeah, I honestly, hand on heart, could not tell you a single thing about the single player boat. But I could tell you of many legendary matches I had with my mates who live around the corner from me.
It's a curio, the single player, I would say, and not much more than that.
Yeah, exactly. It doesn't linger in the memory, right? It's by no means where its legacy comes from.
So yeah, absolutely love it.
All right, then. Ash, I have a question for you.
Yes.
So, because I think you'll be the person who can answer this. OutRun 2, made in Japan?
Yes, it's made by Yu Suzuki. If you're talking about the arcade version, the console ported them by Sumo Digital, but the original game is SEGA AM2, yeah.
It was part of the arcade game, OutRun 2 and Xbox, right?
Yes. I mean, later on, you get to like Coast to Coast, which is more of a kind of console exclusive, but like OutRun 2, you get to OutRun 2 SP, the arcade games made by SEGA.
In which case, I am going to take that for SEGA for my next pick. It is a bit of a, I guess I have two racing games. How the fuck did that happen?
I guess I kind of thought this would be a bit of a tantalizing pick if someone wanted to kill or steal it, because I have loads of backups for this category. Quite a lot of good SEGA games to choose from, obviously. But also just feels like one of those draft winner games to me, where everyone who played it is like, this is one of the best driving games I've ever played.
How gorgeous it looked for the time, that classic thing of picking your different routes and seeing what's down there and having that kind of feel of an adventure to it, as well as it being this quite hardcore arcade experience. Lost the time a little bit because of the Ferrari license in the game, and also the fact that the port on Xbox was not available elsewhere. Actually, it was on PC as well.
Is that right, actually, Ash?
There was a Steam version that's delisted, but bigger boys will tell you where to find it, and it's been modded now, and it's all lovely. But I'll also say the arcade version is still pretty common. You walk into most arcades in this country, you're going to see a really good version of Outrun 2.
The one in Arcade Club in Leeds has got the big full size. You are sitting in a car, it's got two steering wheels, so you dynamically swap controls at certain points of the race. It's still out there, it's still, this game is like 20 years old now.
Again, another one that's never been bettered.
Absolutely phenomenal. I did look at some of the other Sega racing games, like I've got Daytona on Xbox Live Arcade. I think this is a game that you could hand to someone now who's never played a Sega racing game and they would still be impressed by it.
Or a game?
Yeah. I think they'd still be impressed by it. There's something about the arcade race of this era that just are still just super vivid and incredibly exciting.
It's such a good pick. I think Matthew would be stupid not to steal it.
Yeah, so two racing games, but quite different from one another. Definitely Sega at their best. And so we move on to Ash.
All right.
Yeah, you're up next.
Ash, you've taken one of my Sega choices. Cheers for that.
Well, you've got Kill.
There's no way I'm killing Outrun 2. Why would I do that? Couldn't live with myself.
Because it's a great podcast.
That's fair. A question for later on. I'm not going to use it now.
Free Pick. Could I have a game that is published by one of the other categories, but not developed by them?
Yes, because I did that for Nier Automata, so that's only fair.
OK, well, we may return to that.
Minish Cap is back on the menu, boys.
I'm going to go Namco and I'm going to go for Mr. Driller Drillland.
Oh, yeah, you're a Mr. Driller guy.
I knew you'd go Mr. Driller. I knew it.
Yes. I mean, in my heart, the original Mr. Driller is my favourite because it's a fantastic score attack game. For anyone who doesn't know Mr. Driller, imagine Tetris, but you are a little guy inside the well while the blocks are falling, so you have to drill down to the bottom of this well.
Every time you drill, you lose oxygen, so you have to try and manoeuvre to find these bits of oxygen as you're going down the well. Doing so makes you vulnerable to falling rocks, so there's a lot of risk and reward in there, and it's a fantastic score attack game, because if you get all the way to the bottom of the well in a decent amount of time without losing any lives and collecting all the oxygen, you get a massive score, you get on the leaderboards, and you'll be famous for the rest of time. They'll make a documentary about you.
Fantastic. Mr. Driller Drillland was a GameCube exclusive for a long time. It's since been remade on modern platforms, they took that classic concept and then they just expanded it out with loads of variations.
There's one in space, for some reason, where you can get sucked into wormholes. There's one called, what's it called? There's one that's based on the ancient Namco arcade game Tower of Druaga.
So I think it's called Challenge of Druaga or something. So it's still Mr. Driller, but you're a little Mr. Driller with a knight outfit on, suit of armor, and you're drilling down and you're earning experience points and collecting gems that activate spells. And you can use these spells to get out of trouble as you get down and effectively explore an RPG dungeon, but in the form of a puzzle game.
It's absolutely wild. And all of these variations are presented in a theme park wrapper, the titular drill land that you're exploring, packed full of stupid cartoon intros, with this extended family of Mr. Driller characters. Mr. Driller's dad is in it, and Mr. Driller's dad is Dig Dug from the old Namco arcade game from the 80s.
So there's a whole lot. If you want to have a really stupid time, there is a website on Namco Japan's website, where it tells you all of the Namco games that are in the Mr. Driller universe. And there's like 50 games, all from different eras, games that you wouldn't think.
I think Cyber Sled is in the Mr. Driller universe. Mr. Driller's mum is some character from an arcade game that only got one console port and was never seen again. You don't need to know any of that.
That's just for the hardcore Mr. Driller heads. What you do need to know is it's a really like fun, charming puzzle game. I would say better than Puzzle Bobble.
Completely original, dead addictive, dead cute. And if you want to sample it, Drill Land is the best version to go for. And I suggest everyone does because it's a lovely little game.
I mean, Ash says it's better than Puzzle Bobble, but then gave Puzzle Bobble to his daughter. So is he suggesting that Mr. Driller's too good for his daughter? I say to you, the voters, is that good parenting?
Yes or no? I mean, vote for me now. And, you know, I think...
She's got a good judgment not to be a drill head.
At last, we've answered the question of, who's Mr. Driller's Cranky Kong? I was definitely curious about that. So that's good.
But yeah, Ash, you've got another pick.
In that case, I would go Taito. You've taken Puzzle Bobble from me. I'm going to go New Zealand Story.
Another cute little game, cute little game where you play as a kiwi, he's got a bow and arrow. It's kind of part of the same lineage that started with Puzzle Bobble and went through other games like Liquid Kids. I don't know if anyone knows Liquid Kids.
You probably don't.
Just making up games now, Ash.
Liquid Kids is great. But anyway, New Zealand Story, probably people of a certain age know this because it got converted to every home platform going. All the 8-bit micros got one.
The Amiga got one. It was on Mega Drive. Just a really, really kind of fun platform game in the way that platform games, you know, very quickly from the 16-bit era weren't really made in this style.
This is like an 8-bit style platform game where you're a dinky little character in a world that looks cute, but everyone's out to kill you. Famously, the first level ends with you inside the belly of a whale and you're trying to shoot your way out of the belly of this tiny, tiny whale. So you've only got maybe a few pixels left or right that you can move to avoid hazards.
But if you were picking up Retro Gamer magazine or Games TM magazine in the early 2000s, you'd probably turn a page and there'd be a giant screenshot from New Zealand Story because it's one of those games where any kind of still from it just makes you go, wow, old games are good, actually. Look how good that looks.
Nice. Matthew, you kind of groaned at approval. So do you think this is a good pick?
More of like a big blind spot, kind of an iconic little character and brought up by loads of people whose opinions I really trust in these things. I just have no experience of it. Yeah, I don't know why I groaned.
Was it a bloodthirsty groan?
I'm just in a dark place at the moment.
I'm in a dark place at the moment. Okay, I think it's time we broke the seal on Nintendo again. So for my next pick, I'm going to be taking Super Mario Odyssey on Nintendo Switch.
It is, I think after playing Donkey Kong and Bonanza, I was a bit in the head space of, oh yeah, this is actually the sort of like modern 3D platformer because I think it's seeing a couple of the slightly not quite as well thought out ways in which Bonanza uses the different Bonanzas of Donkey Kong to sort of like mix up the level design and add variety where it makes you really appreciate just how big a swing Odyssey was in terms of its different mechanics. We had this problem with the Nintendo Switch draft where you pick Breath of the Wild or you pick Tears of the Kingdom, but it doesn't let you get your arms around all of that by picking just one. But there is only one Mario Odyssey and then the other comparisons you make are to Galaxy, which are quite different games really.
So Odyssey feels like a good pick. Thoughts on this, Matthew Castle?
Yeah, having now played Donkey Kong I'm even more convinced of how good a game Super Mario Odyssey is. I think you're absolutely right. It's the variety of moves.
Obviously Donkey Kong is way more complicated than any of the single transformations you're going to get in this game, but that Nintendo explore 50 different character types, maybe only 20 of them are like really substantially like mechanically different, but like the amount of movement and ideas in that is just crazy to me. I just sort of prefer the music and world a little bit of Mario Odyssey as well. It taps into the Mario history and dredges up the Mario history.
Or maybe it's not that it does a better job. It's just that the Mario history is just so much more packed than Donkey Kong's, that even though Donkey Kong does the same trick, it just doesn't quite land the same way. Anyway, this is a great game, quite bold to pick it.
I still feel like this is being waved as a red flag and there's something else you actually want.
Well, I mean, that's very perceptive of you, Matthew.
This feels like, kill this. I dare you to kill this because actually I want to do blah, but I can't imagine what blah would be.
Well, you may be on to something there, my friend.
So maybe I'm just going to lock you into this excellent game.
Oh, what a terrible fate that would be. I sort of, or maybe I'm spreading out the potential targets in hope of taking something else.
Yeah, it's a good tactic.
Yeah. Well, that's something for you to think about, but Dave, it's your next pick.
I'm going to go Sega and I'm going to go, this is a proper heart pick. You're getting the real me here, everyone. I'm going to go Sonic and Knuckles.
This was like one of the defining games of my childhood. I talked about earlier, I was trying to pick games that either did something different or had like an element of magic to them, and Sonic and Knuckles had that for me, not just because obviously it was a great game, it was the Sonic franchise, just like all the Sonic games just continuing to thrive in platformers, like they're just getting better and better. I think this is sort of where it where it topped out.
The magic for me is in the cartridge. Obviously you open it up, you could put Sonic 3 into it, you could put Sonic 2 in it, and you could play Knuckles. Like that was just mind blowing to me at that age.
Yeah, I just remember it just being this all consuming sort of cultural moment for me and my friends at school. Like, oh my god, have you got Sonic and Knuckles? And then sharing it around so other people can like play it with their Sonic games.
It was just, it was unlike anything we sort of experienced. We didn't know that was even possible. We didn't know they had the technology basically.
So yeah, maybe a lot of this is coming from like the novelty of the fact that you could put in Sonic 3 or Sonic 2 into the into the base cartridge. But yeah, it sort of it was just like the game for me that in all of the Sonic games that like that's the most important to me and sort of my upbringing with Sonic.
OK, yeah, I mean, it's not my favourite Sonic game. I had 2 and CD for potential picks here, but I think 3 combined with Knuckles is a very complete feeling experience. Sort of sums up the Mega Drive in some ways.
Ash, you seem like a deep Sonic takes guy. Any thoughts on this?
Yeah, I had this, loved it. I didn't have any other Sonic games. Just had Sonic and Knuckles.
Yes, I couldn't attach it to any other Sonic games. I didn't have any, so I missed out on that. But just as a standalone game, really loved it.
It was a final Sonic game on Mega Drive. It was Sega having mastered the platform and figured out everything they were doing with the character. So really well-made game.
Lots of fun. Liked it a lot.
Knuckles was super cool to play as versus Sonic. The fact you glide around, you can obviously attach to walls and climb up them. It brought a different dimension to the gameplay.
Felt like you had the cheat codes on, like you were breaking the levels in a good way.
Yeah, exactly. You could be Tails, but fly around, but that felt fairly linear in a way. Like you're just flying up and down, going side by side, that almost felt more like a cheat in the sense, you could just glide over and think and ignore it.
Whereas Knuckles, you have to think about the terrain, where you're moving to and how to access different ledges and stuff. So it was way more interesting than being Tails. So yeah, that's another aspect of it that really helps it stand out against 2 and 2 on 1 for me.
I think Knuckles has the energy of an early ROM hack because he just sort of feels a bit at odds with what a Sonic level is. But I do appreciate that. Definitely sets us apart from the other games.
So fair play.
He was super edgy as a character as well. Like he was...
He really looked up to Knuckles, didn't you? He got you through a lot of dark times. He did.
He was the bad boy, you know, in the video game culture back in 90s, whatever it was, 94. We all admired him. Women wanted to be with him, men wanted to be him, you know, that whole shtick.
Yeah, it's a big moment for you when Idris Elba became that character, I know.
He bought the sex appeal that was required for the role.
OK, moving on from that cursed entry, we come to Matthew's two picks.
So...
You must be at the end now.
No, I'm two picks behind, I never remember. The problem is, obviously I want to kill one of Dave's games, but like, and I mean this in the kindest way possible, like I can't be bothered to kill any of them. Like the only one I actually want to kill, the only one which is like super valuable, is the only one I can't kill because he stole it from me.
Like he's made himself bulletproof just by picking.
Why me?
Why not Ash?
Don't you think it's funnier to make him pick another Taito game, though Matthew, where he has to like scramble?
Or another treasure game.
I'm already ahead of you there on both of those, so I don't need to worry too much.
I'm just torn because obviously I've sworn vengeance, but actually like tactically, like it's going to make way more sense to kill one of Sam's games. But anyway, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I'm pushing us to absolute breaking point for Capcom.
I'm going to pick an Ultimate Castle Heart pick. I know there are bigger Capcom games here I could have. I'm going to take Ghost Trick, Phantom Detective, which is obviously Shuu Takumi's stand-alone puzzle adventure where you play as a ghost trying to undo the deaths of characters basically in a reverse final destination, turning the props of domestic environments into life-saving devices.
I've picked this rather than Ace Attorney because I think the problem whenever you pick an Ace Attorney is you want like the whole sweep of the series. It's quite hard to pick one Ace Attorney that makes perfect sense, where I think Ghost Trick is like perfectly self-contained and is in itself just one of the neatest bits of like narrative design of all time. I think it's so elegantly done.
I wish Shootakumi would do more of this. I think it is, yeah, it's a great game.
I actually did have the original Ace Attorney down as my sort of potential pick for that series if it came down to it. And so I can see why Ghost Trick is a one-off and therefore it makes the most sense.
The best Ace Attorney for me is 3, but only because it pays off like 1 and 2. And in a draft that's a bit of a like, hmmm.
I think that makes sense, yeah.
And also I don't think anyone's going to fuck with that.
Yeah, and you know, I still believe you're like 5% responsible for them remastering this and bringing it back, Matthew. I want to believe that you're...
Maybe I should have been the voice of that trailer anyway.
Okay, another pick.
For Sega, I'm going to pick Yakuza Zero.
Oh yeah, dependable.
Yeah, absolutely. It's not the spiciest of draft picks. I don't have that huge emotional connection to older Sega and their sort of older feeling games.
I get a lot of those games in Yakuza games because they're in the arcades, which is awesome. But I'm not trying to kind of like cheaply cash in this as multiple games. Picking this because it is a great entry point in the series.
Get to go in, get to enjoy some of that 80s attitude, get to dance in the night club, sing all the cool karaoke songs, all the hundreds of hours of usual side activities you do in this game. Quietly, well not quietly, very loudly and obnoxiously, one of the funniest games going. Yeah, it's absolutely superb series.
You can kill it off, I'll just pick a different one. So, you know, do your worst.
I think it's another series where it's maybe quite hard to pick one that sums it all up.
Yeah.
Especially now there's been two new, good ones, you know.
Yeah, there is that. I think I could make a separate case for one of the turn-based RPG versions of this, but for the simple kind of traditional brawling Yakuza, I think this is still a pretty solid pick.
Yeah, I think it's the combo of this and Persona 5 that won me that PS4 draft. So I think it is solid drafting. Okay, we come to Dave's next pick, or final pick, no, second to last pick.
Second to last, so...
Assuming you have nothing killed or stolen.
Yes, yes. I'm gonna go to Sony. I'm gonna go to Ico.
I'm sure this came up in previous drafts.
Show the closet stick, because you talked about an Adam Sandler movie for five minutes instead.
Yeah, Rain Over Me, which is a fantastic movie. So yeah, this one, Horn Boy escorts someone around. It's sort of the elevator pitch, but...
Chat GBT at it again, Dave.
Yeah, it's Chat GBT at it again. I honestly should actually put it into Chat GBT and just read off. This is great.
It's a really beautiful, sort of haunting, minimalist game where you basically have to escort. Is she a princess? She's like the daughter of the queen of the castle, whatever.
You have to escort around the castle. She tried to escape. And when I was sort of doing the prep for this, I saw this thing about Ueda and his design philosophy around subtraction and sort of removing anything that isn't important to the story or world.
And so that makes everything like super streamlined, but the combat is very basic. And apparently there was a much more complicated combat system in before, at least a much more in depth one. But I don't think any of that really matters because it's all about the connection you make with with Yoda to the point where, you know, those little sections where you have to sort of separate yourself, it becomes very stressful.
You've also got those times where, you know, if you leave her alone for too long, she gets taken by shadow creatures. And it's just this, yeah, just this really beautiful puzzle game that again, like Shadow of the Colossus, like watching Flow again, watching Flow recently reminded me of it. And yeah, like it's been hugely influential.
And, you know, Ueda remains like one of the best, one of the all-timers.
It's a great game. And, you know, definitely kicks off an important part of that Sony Japan lineage. It has been drafted before, but I think it remains a favorite.
Shadow Clauses or Ico, you decide, listeners. I think, actually, there's probably a bit of a split in people who like those games. But yes, a solid pick, Dave.
Yes, there's not loads of really obvious things from Sony Japan's side, but I think that makes sense. It's my penultimate, in theory, pick. And I'm going to be taking for From Software Bloodborne, which is the game of theirs I've played, and I think that probably the third most.
I've definitely played it for over 20 hours. I didn't get much further than Matthew. I got past Vicar Amelia.
I heard the screams, the woman's screams coming from that dog thing in my nightmares for about a week after playing it. Then I played a bit where I got out of a prison cell and a boulder ran me over and I uninstalled it. That's my journey with Bloodborne, but I did play a lot of it.
And the reason that people are still hung up on this game, I think, is the very specific Lovecraft, cosmic horror vibes of it and the Victorian, London style art direction that just makes it so visually distinctive from Dark Souls and Elden Ring. It really is a one of one. And I think that's why people still just cannot get this out of their heads and are obsessed with the idea of it being remade or resurfaced in some way.
It does feel like money on the table for Sony if they ever do choose to do that. Nonetheless, it is a defining PS4 game, even though Sekiro is my favourite game by the studio. I accept that a lot of people like it, so it feels like a strong pick on paper.
I think if you leave Bloodborne untouched, I'm saying this to Dave and Ash, if you leave this untouched, this could be a draft winner. I'm not saying, I'm just putting it out there. Alarm bells are ringing around this one, guys.
Well, I mean, you've got the same cards that we do.
I just think one of you got the... I'm so far from acting.
I know why. It's because if you act against me, you've got three people coming after you. So, so far, it's kind of like a bit of a piece.
Everyone has to do something next go though, right?
Yeah, it's true. It's the last turn in theory.
Everyone has to do something.
But then Matthew's got more turns. And then at that point, it really unravels. So we're past the three hour mark.
This has maybe all gone wrong in some ways, but let's move on to Ash's next two picks.
Right. These are my final two. So if I'm going to kill something, I have to do it now.
I'm going to make... I'm going to kill something. Why wouldn't I?
Why wouldn't you, spirit? He's genuinely nerve wracking.
Well, you should be worried, Dave.
Why?
Why? We all agreed to attack Matthew before the...
Don't play into his narrative. This is how we'll get the listeners to vote for him. So they'll think it's a real narrative.
It was Ash's idea. We were all there, Sam.
So we all made a blood oath.
I don't really see the point in playing tactically and trying to eliminate one of the winning picks because I never win these things anyway. I just have too many heart picks.
I think you picked well though in this one, Ash.
Well, thank you. But my kill is just motivated by annoyance. Dave, you've annoyed me.
Bomberman94, instead of Saturn Bomberman, the beautiful Saturn Bomberman that was 10 players, a 10 player Bomberman on your Sega Saturn. What are you thinking? This is going to score me no points.
It's not going to make any difference, but I cannot allow Bomberman94 to go ahead over Saturn Bomberman. So chucking a load of bombs in there, you've fucked to get out.
That's not how I was expecting the first kill to go.
No. Poor Dave.
I could just pick Super Bomberman 2 though, which was my other Bomberman pick.
Does Dave have to replace it now?
No, it comes back to his turn. It circles back.
Dave, please just replace it with Saturn Bomberman and then you're more likely to win.
But you still have your two picks, Ash.
I still have my two. If you replace it with Bomberman93, then you are a dick.
I'll replace it with Bomberman64 just to spite you.
Oh my god.
Tiger Woods Pro Bomberman98.
Right, free pick. I'm conflicted across two of my favorite games, but I am going to go with a Neo Geo game published by SNK, developed by Nazca. And that game is Metal Slug, which is, for my money, the best run and gun game of all time.
It also, through the power of the Neo Geo and 1990s Japanese budgets, has just the most phenomenal pixel art. I don't think you will ever see it again, because it would just be far too expensive to do now. Like every single screen of that game is like a sight, to behold, it's spectacular.
And it plays really well too. Like it's action packed, fast and fluid, lots of other words that games reviewers used in the 90s. Responsive.
It's just, it's one of those games you can pick up and you are, like, I think guaranteed to have a good time. Like it, this will maybe sound like a psychopath, but it feels good to shoot people in that game. You know, the way they kind of like keel over and the blood squirts out, it's all like gloriously animated.
Yeah, wonderful, wonderful game.
Easily playable now as well, can get hold of this.
Ace on everything, get it dirt cheap, brilliant game. Which leaves, I've left the hardest to last Sega. I adore Sega.
I could probably pick a hundred Sega games.
I mean, it could be your last pick, you don't know yet.
Yeah, almost certainly won't be my last pick. I'm going to go Super Monkey Ball, specifically the GameCube version. It feels like it was made especially for that GameCube controller, amazing analog controls.
It's essentially an arcade conversion of Monkey Ball. So you're guiding a little monkey around mazes, the tilt, don't drop the monkey. That's all good fun, but what made Super Monkey Ball so amazing was the party games, specifically Monkey Target.
I cannot tell you how much of my life I have lost to competitive Monkey Target. I've still got my GameCube memory card with my high scores from university on there. Absolutely cherish that game and those memories.
Wonderful, wonderful game. But also if you kill it, doesn't matter because Sega are probably the best developer that's ever lived, and there's loads more games.
It's a good pick. GameCube classics come up in the drafts before. I can't remember when, but it's...
I think we discussed it when we did the top 10 Sega games.
Oh yeah, of course. And yeah, Monkey Target is amazing. I feel like if someone had just put Monkey Target on iPhone at the very early days of that app store launching, they would have made millions.
It's just Monkey Target and nothing else. Anyway, yes.
I played a lot of Monkey Billiards as well for my sins.
Yeah, I like cycling through all of those, playing those with my brother. I regrettably though, I did it on Monkey Ball Deluxe on Xbox. But yeah, you're right.
The GameCube controller is perfect for it. Okay, we come to my final, in theory, pick. I've not used either my steal or kill.
That means you've got to use your steal, right?
Well, let me just preface this by saying, I don't want to add more insult to injury for Matthew, but he did choose to take Metal Gear Solid 3 curiously early in this cycle, and I would have taken this game from anyone because I think it would be more of a heart pick than MGS5 would, which I think is a bit of a cold, logical, good pick. It has to be Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater will be taking the subsistence version. And I know that this unleashes warfare between myself and Matthew because it will feel more personal coming from me than it will from Dave and Ash.
But I will warn you Matthew that if you start war, I will kill Astrobot next. So, just keep that in mind.
Do it.
Spicy. Then you'll have to pick another Sony game. So, I'm just saying, it's a bit of a like, guns pointed in all direction Tarantino film moment here.
I hate to do it to you. And you might actually...
He's threatening you, Matthew.
I will say that there are, there's still MGS2 and MGS here, but to not use the steal and kill tokens when I added them to the draft mix, I mean, it feels disingenuous. I still respect you as a friend and a podcaster. Sorry.
I guess we'll see what happens. I have not used my kill token, but of course if I do get another turn, then I will get to use my kill token. We also can't rule out of course that Dave might do something chaotic here on his last turn.
But you know, Ash has also pointed guns at him. So Matthew, your thoughts? Sorry.
Yeah, I mean, yeah, that obviously sucks. That's too Konami fix. You did say it could happen.
I thought I could lay out enough other temptations that you might not do it. But yeah, that hasn't happened, annoyingly. Anything could happen.
Anything could happen.
So wait, your friend is kill Astrobot. If I what?
We'll see what happens. But in the meantime, we've got Dave's again. It's not your final turn, Dave, is it?
Because you lost Spiderman. So you got two turns.
Oh, yes.
Yeah. But that's OK. What's your next pick, Dave?
All right. I'm going to go in Namco. I'm going to go Time Crisis 2, which is sort of perennial arcade classic, still found in many arcades this day.
Brilliant game.
Have I ever completed this? No, I think I've only ever got the sort of speedboat part, maybe just a bit beyond that. I think there's the train bit after that.
I can't remember, but I think I've got a little bit further. But I mean, this is classic arcade gameplay for me, like playing with myself, with a friend, two light guns, just having a great time, wasting about five pounds until our money's run out. But it's just very responsive.
It's got a pedal. It's got a pedal.
Well, they don't all have pedals though, right?
They do all have pedals. That's time crisis.
I've definitely played one without a pedal at an arcade.
This is a brilliant game. I think like the final level of this is a bit slightly boring warehouse, but the bit where all those bowels are being pushed down those stairs, in that Italian looking place is pretty cool.
It's such a dick part though. It's like it's just, you know, its whole intent is to make you lose health so that you could have to put in another pound.
It's true. I did finish this because I went to an arcade bar in Bristol where the machine was busted and it just kept giving us unlimited continue so we just finished it. I think it's a great pick Dave.
I don't know why I didn't even think of Flight Gun Games. That's a bit of a failure on my part. We come to Matthew's next two picks.
Interesting. For Konami I'm going to take Silent Hill 2.
Original? Of course.
Yeah, original. Yeah. Maybe less sexy.
Oh, I'd say less sexy in the light of there being an all singing all dancing remake, but in a game which is so dependent on vibes, it having its own distinct look and style, I think it's still like valid. It isn't like completely overwritten.
Agreed.
Imitated by many dark, twisted psychological horror where you're belting in all kinds of meaty horrors with a big metal pipe while gradually unpicking what it is, what damage it is that you're suffering that brings you to this town and brings everyone else to this town. One of the most discussed, analyzed, lauded games of all time. Honestly, not like my favourite Konami thing.
I would have liked to have had a Metal Gear, but I feel like this is a stronger pick than going into older or weirder Metal Gears.
One other pick here, Matthew.
I've still got Free Pick and Nintendo left. I just think, Ash, I wish you hadn't used your kill on Bomberman. I wish you'd used it to have done some damage to some of Sam's picks here.
Well, maybe it's time for you to use yours.
Yeah, there is. But he's like a hydra. He's got quite a few heads in the game.
There's not one where you're like, oh, the bastard's dead.
I just, I know I swore vengeance on Ash, but I want to win. I want to play the game as tactically as I can. I think it's too...
He's going the good guy castle route.
I think it's too strong a pick, so I will kill Bloodborne.
Ah, I did kind of put that on the board a little bit knowing this would happen. I did delay it as long as possible to avoid the scenario.
So I'll kill Bloodborne. I mean, that's not a complete deal breaker. There are still other From Stuff stuff in the mix.
I understand that, but I just think Bloodborne has that ring to it.
Are there more Sony games that you want to pick there, Matthew?
Yeah, I've got a good backup actually. Okay. So do your worst if you're there.
If you got the guts, my man. Okay. Okay.
My free pick, I'm going to take Tetris Effect. All right. Enhance Games.
Well, obviously I picked Space Invaders Extreme earlier, which I said was like a proto Tetris Effect. I think this is one of the all time greats. I've said it a million times on this podcast.
The game that made Tetris really properly kind of click for me, take a huge amount of pleasure in it, still dip into it whenever I'm feeling a bit stressed. I think it's just like the ultimate stress reliever, that sort of amazing music, those visuals. I find it incredibly calming or stressful if you want to actually play some, or attempt to play some high level Tetris.
But I think, yeah, I absolutely love this game. This is a huge, huge hard pick for me. And I think they're one of Japan's coolest success stories.
What's going on with Enhance and everything around them. Obviously looking forward to Lumines and also really liked that one with all the little people walked around humanity. That was it.
And that was also a banger. So yes, I end my turn there.
Very good, Matthew. Okay, Dave, we come to you.
And I have to kill something. This is fun.
What do I go for? Wouldn't it be funny if someone killed Elden Ring so Matthew couldn't pick another from the game? Because I'm gonna take Dark Souls when it's my next pick.
So what would Matthew pick after that? He'd have to take three or two.
I'd have to take a Dark Souls 2 and hope for the best. I don't want to attack. Don't do it.
I mean...
It wasn't supposed to go this way. It just curdled so quickly and the target got pointed at you. And then I...
But I knew you'd take it more personally when it was me, Matthew. I just knew it would mean more. That's the thing.
Dave.
I will kill... I mean, there's an ash choice. I think there's a clear ash choice.
Oh, Mr. Drill Land.
That would hurt him. And he did attack me. Unprovoked.
I'm helping you, Dave. I'm clearing the board so you can replace it with something better.
I cannot believe how long we've been recording. Do it, Dave.
I know, I know. It's just really under... All right, fuck it.
I'm going to kill...
Oh, I don't want to do it.
All right, just for lols. I'll kill... Yeah, I'll kill Elton Rick.
Oh, fucking... Why would I just...
I might not kill Astro Bot now, because it just seems like...
You do whatever you want.
Not kick a man to death while he's down.
Honestly, I would come out the end of this stronger than ever before.
Oh, okay. It's great that your plan has come together, Sam, for demolishing Matthew. Well done.
Yeah, but he might still win, because I could say pity vote, and people will be like, oh, yeah, I like Astro Bot. I'll vote for that.
And then I will... Is it in bad spirit to just pick Super Bomberman 2 after getting Bomberman 94 killed?
It is, really. When's that ever stop you, Dave?
I will go. I will not then. I instead will go.
As everyone know, one of my favorite games of all time, New Ghostbusters 2, by Hal-A-Hass.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God. I've made this happen.
Yeah, you did. But I love it. It's like one of my favorite games of all time.
I spoke about it endlessly on the Ghostbusters podcast, so listen to that if you haven't already. But this new Ghostbusters 2, it's got a weird history because there was another Ghostbusters 2 game on the NES. This was the second one.
It was also out on Game Boy, developed by Howe, has a very chibi Pokemon-esque sort of art style. And you get to play as two Ghostbusters at the same time, one that has the proton pack, one that has the trap. And one of the great pleasures of this game is that you get to play as Rick Moranis' character from the movie Louis Tully.
So I love the soundtrack to this because it recreates a lot of the 80s pop from the actual movie soundtrack. Yeah, I love it. Everyone knows I love it.
I talked about it loads on the last pod. So it's no surprise that I picked it.
Yep. Good stuff, Dave.
And you want to steal that?
Exactly.
Well, this is my final turn, but I might just backpocket my kill in case I need to use it in Retribution for anything else that might happen. I think that maybe the Elden Ring thing has done the damage that I would like to have done anyway to Matthew, and I do think it's been. It's maybe bordering on unfair to keep killing games of his, but I may change my mind depending on what his Nintendo pick ends up being.
Let's find out. My final pick yet again is Dark Souls. I will take this.
I have played loads of this game as well, actually. I got to Anor Londo, then I reached those two big lads, and Wes Fenland told me, you haven't got a good enough sword for these lads, you need to go back and get one stone to upgrade this sword. And I never played it again, and it was the middle of COVID, so I've banished it as a cursed COVID memory, along with many other memories.
Did we try to play this together on Switch?
Night Rain really takes care of this, it's a fucking pain in the ass to play this with a mate, really. I could definitely still admire the sort of like world building, the sort of dark medieval cursed storytelling vibes, great bosses and all that stuff, things I should like, but where the RPG kind of like variants of it just makes it a harder sell to me, a bit more amorphous than the beautiful purity of Sekiro. But nonetheless, that has been picked and stolen already.
So Dark Souls is a perfectly good entry because it's one of the most acclaimed games ever made. So perfectly solid way to end the draft here in theory. Before we circle back to Ash, have you got any more picks, Ash, are you done?
I think I'm done, aren't I, unless someone punishes me?
Yeah, unless someone punishes you.
So it comes back around to Dave, I think, or Dave, are you done as well?
I'm done too.
So it's Matthew, Matthew's final pick, right?
I've got a few picks left. Let's start with Square Enix and I will take Chrono Trigger. Epic time traveling adventure, hugely influential.
I feel like it has come up in drafts a few times and has done okay. Not a company I've got huge ties to. I wasn't going to pick the Centennial case.
I just don't think that was going to have the juice, but I think this is a nice chunky classic. Maybe a little too close in tone to Secret of Mana, we will see.
Yeah, I mean, I love this game. I definitely think it's a one of one Chrono Cross, quite different to it. Still the most accessible, I think, of these SNES games to go back to.
The most complete feeling, doesn't waste too much of your time with level grinding, etc. Okay, Matthew, how many picks have you got left after this?
I've got Nintendo and I've got to plug my From Software Gap and I've got to steal. Nintendo… I know we talked about splitting the difference and that there is no one true answer here.
I am going to… I'm going to take Tears of the Kingdom. We're not going to re-litigate the whole Zelda thing here, but…
Not three and a half hours into the recording, though.
Amazing gadgets, amazing invention. I love returning to that world. Incredible vibes.
Actually a story that I think lands quite well once you unpick what's been going on with Zelda in the past. Going up to the skies, rediscovering that recently on Switch 2 where it all actually runs as it probably should have in the first place. It's kind of like seeing the game as it was meant to be.
I still really loved it on Switch 1, but I've been playing this from the start again on Switch 2 in between my many other things and just absolutely love it. I think it's the same broad exploration, but with just a lot more ways of expressing yourself within that world. I don't think it diminishes the freedom too much, but that's okay.
I know some people disagree, but that's fine.
Yeah, solid pick. I really did think you would steal Mario Odyssey, but I guess like you maybe reasoned that on paper it's probably easier to keep things as is than create that kind of like…
You can't kill… Oh, you can kill. No, you can't kill unless I give you an opportunity to kill.
Yeah, exactly.
So I can lock you in. I had this beautiful plan where you were going to kill Astrobot and then I was going to steal Shadow of the Glossers off you.
Well, that's the thing, I thought Shadow of the Glossers would actually tempt one of you to kill or steal it.
So instead, I'm going to use my last steal to plug a gap, and I'm going to take Demon's Souls.
I didn't even think about that, that's excellent.
Yeah, I played a chunk of this on PS5 and Dave so eloquently described it early on and I thought, you know what, yeah, that's the stuff, that game's got the stuff. If I have a chance to somehow integrate that into my draft, I will absolutely do that.
Matthew loves the level where you become the boss in the dungeon to the other guy, he loves that stuff.
Yeah, that was a highlight for me, surely. It was just too much specificity. I started licking my lips.
Yeah, that's me locked in and now immune in from software, so do your worst, motherfucker.
It's okay.
Well, Dave, then I guess, Dark Souls 2 or 3, which one are you taking?
King's Feel 3.
Yeah, those aren't going to happen. I'll go with Dark Souls 3. Yeah, that's the right choice here.
It's, yeah, it's the final sort of mainline Souls game. They did. I played this just before my daughter was born.
I remember it very vividly.
Oh, don't tell me you got a good story about this fucking game.
Well, it was like a, it was a ticking clock for me. I had to complete it before she was born, knowing that all my spare time was going to get completely wiped out for the foreseeable future, and I just wanted to give it all my attention. So it was something that consumed every spare minute of time I had for about a month.
Yeah, I genuinely think it is the pinnacle of the three Dark Souls games. It's more mechanically streamlined. The set pieces are bigger.
The enemies are more elaborate, if that's even possible. Yeah, I haven't really prepped on Dark Souls 3.
That's all right, Dave.
This is all I've got. It's a really good game. I played it.
I didn't review it at the time because I think I'd finished in games journalism, but I'd give it a 10 out of 10 if I had.
I was so cursed that because of all the kills and steals, that we ended up talking about fucking eight or nine like from software games or something. The antithesis of what this podcast is about. What a curse worthy of Miyazaki lore.
That's what I'd say about that.
The purity of my Demon's Souls pick has just completely been...
Appropriate. This is what cultural appropriation is like, Dave. A very sobering lesson for you.
I'm sure you'll agree.
Absolutely. I like to walk away learning something from these podcasts.
Wow, I just can't believe none of you stole Rezny Evil 2 2019. I thought that was like...
It was tempting.
That was high on my kill list.
The thing is there's too many Capcom things you can plug the gaps with. Capcom is like...
Rezny is a hard one to pick one game from all of it though. I think that's the... Anyway.
Well, anyway, we're free of the draft lads. We did it. If you'd like to vote on the winner, you can go to the announcements bit of the Discord.

To see who picked what, sorry. In deciding who the winner is. Like I say, it's in the Discord's Announcements channel.
If you want to link to the Discord, just go to twitter.com/backpagepod or our blue Skype page at back page pod as well. I know that seems complicated, but yep. You can also debate the picks in the episode chat there.
I thought this was a brilliant episode, lads. So I think the kill and steal will definitely be making a return. And I look forward to our next one in three months when Matthew is recovered from the edit from this episode.
Where can people get you on social media, Dave?
Get me on Letterboxd, Davey Scarborough, and you can get me on Blue Sky at Scarborough.
