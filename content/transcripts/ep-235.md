Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how's the toe? I've had to hear about it on social media for about five or six days in a row. What is the situation with the toe?
Why do you keep posting about the toe? And is there any, you know, sort of like progress on the toe?
My toe is poorly. I won't go into the specifics because it's grim, but I keep soothing it in a washing up bowl of salty warm water. I'm not sharing that because I think that's inherently interesting.
Every time I've shared it, it has been adjacent to criticism of the latest season of The Bear.
Yep.
So that's really what I'm going for is I'm trying to juxtapose The Bear with all its hunks that everyone loves, and me criticising it with my foot in a bowl of washing up water. That's Matthew Castle behind the tweet, a new series I've got going.
Nice. You'll be launching a separate Patreon for that, won't you? patreon.com/behind the tweet with Mattie C.
It hasn't really landed as a bit.
Yeah. How did you feel about me sort of weighing in on the toe this morning in the replies? Are you happy with that?
Unhappy? I didn't get a message from you and I thought you'd be like, Samuel, I don't think it's appropriate that you're-
No, I feel like you were saying what a lot of people were thinking but are too scared to say.
Yeah. I was also wondering if you playing Death Stranding 2, a game where a man runs around in an environment delivering things, is using his feet, is on his feet constantly.
Oh, interesting.
Is it more of a fantasy to play a game like that when your toe is in disrepair, would you say?
Yeah. The way I play Death Stranding is constantly pushing him towards a lazier life. I'm trying to get him into vehicles.
I'm focusing on building out road networks so he can just drive everywhere. I really make it a very joyless experience. I've stripped out all the hiking.
Yeah, I hadn't really thought of it. I mean, there's obviously a lot going on with my toe and my headspace, and playing that game, maybe that's why it has resonated as much as it has. One of the most cursed things about the Death Stranding lore is that you build shoes, hiking boots, to walk around and they wear out.
And if your shoes break in when you're in the middle of nowhere, you're basically fucked, because your feet will start to bleed and you'll get permanent health decreases from that. But there are plants which grow… I can't work out if they're leaves or fruit, which are called sandal plants, and they basically grow a pair of shoes that you can put on as a temporary respite from walking barefoot.
And what's going on there? Is he basically inserting his feet into two pairs? Or is it some kind of nettle pod?
Who knows?
Yeah, okay. Well, lots to think about there. I was about to say, is he about to say that Kojima's invented a plant that grows shoes?
I thought you were literally going to say that. And you kind of did.
Yeah, I mean, he has. It's such a good design fix for what happens if someone's in the middle of nowhere and their shoes break. What does a shoe plant do?
And everyone's like, oh, genius, maestro, maestro.
Would it make more sense if it was like, you have to go and find a pair of shoes that were meant to be delivered to someone, to either one of his mates, like Jeff Keighley or Conan O'Brien, and like, oh, I've just taken Conan O'Brien's shoes instead? Would that make more sense as a kind of solution to the shoe mechanic, Matthew? Or is there a strict never open a parcel policy in the Norman Reedus Postal Service?
Oh, never open a parcel. I think the idea of, like, thieving from the parcels being like a mechanic, I like the idea of that. I like the idea of Conan O'Brien ordering, you know, an expensive pair of desperately tries to think of shoe brand New Balance shoes.
Yep, that's correct. Well done.
And then he opens the box and finds two, like, manky pairs in there. And he's like, well, obviously that's, I know, I see what's happened here.
Hmm, yeah, that's, I mean, that is good. Can I ask, is the shoes wearing out mechanic in Death Stranding 1, or is that exclusive to the second one?
No, that was in Death Stranding 1 as well. A lot of what was in 2 was in 1.
Okay, well, that seems like a good moment to keep talking about Death Stranding 2, On the Beach, Matthew.
Yeah, this wasn't me, like, shoehorning us into a Death Stranding 2 conversation. Yeah. I was hoping for us to talk about whatever.
Okay, well, you know, that's absolutely fine, because I don't have loads of life updates to give you. Most of what I've been doing is going to be covered by this What We've Been Playing episode. So this episode, we've got like a massive array of, you know, a wide array of different types of games coming up in this one.
So Death Stranding 2, On the Beach, as developed by Hideo Kojima and Chris Rea will be first. So look forward to us discussing that. The football game Rematch is a new obsession of mine.
Looking forward to dig into that, Matthew. Less of an obsession is the game MindsEye, which I played for 90 minutes and will never play again, not to spoil that discussion in advance. Matthew's also been playing Date Everything, the new dating simulator game from published by Team 17 and made by a bunch of voice actors who seem like thoroughly nice dudes.
And a bit on a game I've never heard of, Matthew, called Pipstrello and the Cursed Yoyo, which seems like a very Matthew Castle. That sounds like a WiiWare game, that. I want to believe that you've downloaded a new WiiWare game to play in 2025.
And I've got a tiny bit on Helldivers 2 as well, which I have re-installed and been playing and checking out the new updates. So lots to get into. Death Stranding 2, Matthew.
So this, more than any other video game blockbuster release I can remember, feels like an if you're in, you're in. And if you're out, you're out kind of sequel release. It's not like, it doesn't seem to me like this is going to come along and people are going to be like, you know what, it's time to jump on board with the Death Stranding franchise.
This feels very much like, you know, the Church of Death Stranding has grown and grown, I think, over the past few years. It's a snowballing phenomenon, especially as it's released on PC and Xbox. So do you think that's a fair assessment?
Is this a game that's for the people who are already enchanted by the first one?
I mean, that is definitely its optimal audience. I think I have seen critics say they didn't like the first one and then they did enjoy this one. I've seen people jump on board the Death Stranding train.
I think that definitely happened, not specifically in Death Stranding 2, I think that happened over the life of Death Stranding 1. I think a lot of people wrestled with what that game was at launch. Some terrible reviews of that game.
I've said this before, the tone of the conversation when Death Stranding came out and the weight of the world was on it and people wanted to see what he had walked away from Metal Gear Solid to make and it was quite weird and I felt like a lot of the reviews were talking about it, like it was impossible to even grasp what this game was, which is preposterous. It's a relatively simple thing as we'll get into in a moment. But I definitely felt that conversation change when it came to PC.
Maybe this just fits PC better. Maybe people are more open to slightly weirder genre experiments. There's some crossover with some sort of indie fare that maybe opened people up to this a little bit.
Plus, COVID happened as well, so the game's relevance changed, you know?
That happened, yeah. It's quite hard to pin down what happened. I covered this Death Stranding 1 when it came on PC and I remember thinking, oh, well, this is clearly just a good game and its strengths seem very obvious to me.
And if you go back at launch, it was all kind of like piss grenades and blood grenades and there's a baby and a beach and what the fuck? Like, no one can comprehend it. And you're like, well, actually, it's a game about walking across land masses with some idiosyncratic skins on some quite conservative ideas like grenades.
You know, just because it's full of piss doesn't mean it's not a grenade.
You know, I want that on a poster. Like, can someone design that in the Discord?
Well, I just feel like we focused too much on the piss, which we didn't understand. And not enough on the grenade, which was like, well, I know what I'm meant to be doing.
Damn, you should run for Parliament. This is great stuff, Matthew.
Yeah. So anyway, when I played this on PC, I had definitely had the vibe of like, what was the big deal? This is good.
So that's to me anyway, is the environment that Death Stranding 2 On the Beach is releasing into, if that answers your question.
Yeah, it does. And you know, you are right that, for example, Simon Cardi of IGN was cooler on the first game, but loved the second one. So clearly the differences are, you know, it's significant enough that people's minds can be changed.
What I would say is definitely true about On the Beach is that it gets out of its own way a little bit. One of the challenges Death Stranding 1 had was trying to introduce a huge amount of lore and world building, which basically kills the first 10 hours of that game, makes it quite a hard slog. If you can get through that, most people will probably make it to the end of the game, but that is quite a big ask and I think sours people on it.
And, you know, this game, because it assumes you know all that, it skips it a lot of it, doesn't really introduce a lot of those ideas. And, it may mean in the long term, there's a few things you're puzzled by. You know, this is a game with a lot of nonsense terminology, you know, beaches, there's a thing called dooms, where doom is written all in capital letters, void outs.
It just has a lot of like nonsense terms in here, but it also gets you into the meat of what the game is. You are a delivery man in this sort of post-apocalyptic world. Most of your missions involve carrying objects between human outposts across this map.
There's a bit of a hiking simulation going on, so it's not just a case of walking the right direction, you have to think about not being overburdened, you can get unbalanced. It's not like Baby Steps, which is the new game from Bennett Foddy. It's not you're controlling every limb individually in a crazy physics simulation, but it's a little bit more involved than walking Link across a field, say, in Zelda.
So you've got that element of it. You have strange ghosts, there are bandits who want to steal your deliveries. You have to think about those.
That introduces like a stealth element. But really the meat of the game is working out how to conquer terrain, weather on foot in vehicles. You've got a vast number of gadgets you can purchase and upgrade, use ladders to cross bridges or ropes to descend cliffs.
You can also invest in infrastructure which makes the whole thing a lot easier. You can build bridges across rivers, permanent bridges. You can invest in building roads which you can then drive across as you build a big road network.
So that's the kind of shape of it. And I just think it gets you into the meat of that a lot faster than the first one, which is why I think people are responding more positively. I think it gets you to some of the gadgets in a slightly more fun way.
I think there's a little less ghost stuff in this one. I've played about 20 hours and I would say when I played the first game, 80% of what I was doing involved being quite scared of these ghosts, which are called BTs. And so far there hasn't been a huge amount of ghosty stuff.
He maybe gives you one ghosty mission in every five. You know, that does change the tone of the game is instantly less stressful. You can just enjoy the hiking, the movement of the thing.
There's a little bit more focus on action than there was in the first game. Like they've definitely upped the kind of behaviors of the human attackers. They've got bases which feel a little bit more like outposts in Metal Gear Solid Phantom Pain.
Like you can look at them from afar and tag people and approach them from different angles. All of that was in the first game, but the delivery men never felt like a huge focus of it. That was something they actually increased a bit more in the Director's Cut of Death Stranding 1 where they added a few more weapons.
That felt like a dry run for what's happening here. So just generally, the flavors are a little bit richer and they're introduced in a slightly more interesting way. So I think he's just let people kind of enjoy it more easily.
It's probably what's happening with the jump in review scores.
That's very interesting because, yeah, like he has been out there talking about how it was too good when it was being tested by some players or something like that. And so they made changes based on that. And yet, you know, having a 90 Metacritic score would suggest that, like you say, they've brought the barriers down to enjoying it in some ways.
So that's nice. I was curious, like, how you find the story element of it works in this one, because the story, I don't really understand from what I've played of Death Stranding so far. I know that the ending of the first game was very contentious because the amount of story that was in there.
And I think in general, it's fair to say that Kojima's approach to narrative is divisive. You know, it's not for everyone. It's not even always for me, as someone who enjoys his games.
And like I say, I don't really know how I feel about the original Death Stranding, as I'm going to go through it. But how do you feel about that side of things in this game?
All the complexities and weirdness of the world are there. They're just not front and center. So it feels a bit more of a character piece.
Without spoiling what happens in Death Stranding 1, this one opens with like Norman Reedus and his baby, the baby he had in the container in the first game is now a little older. He's more like a toddler. They're kind of like living quite close to Mexico, if not inside Mexico and get given a task to to join up Mexico by Fragile, who's played by Lea Sadoo.
The closest thing you have to like a handler in both games, you know, she runs a delivery service. She's quite enigmatic and, you know, there's things you learn about her and her backstory through hanging out with her in in both the first game and this game. But you're just trying to have a quiet life with this baby.
I think those are quite easy stakes to understand. And the way that life is kind of upset sort of at the end of the prologue rather, I wouldn't even say it's the first act. It's like three or four hours into the game, you know, something happens which basically pushes you to go and visit Australia.
And in Australia, you've basically got a new landmass that you are connecting by moving between bases and you're bringing them on to this thing called the chiral network. Let's just call it the Internet. You're bringing the Internet back to a world where there isn't the Internet.
Except now everyone's Australian. Well, this is weird. Most people are Australian, but each outpost that you go to is...
It's run by like one of Kojima's celebrity pals.
Right.
You know, when you see pictures of people going to visit him in his studio, it's normally, I feel anyways, they've gone there to be 3D mapped so that they can be one of these outpost managers in Death Stranding. But they're not voiced by themselves, because a lot of them aren't actors. They're just like musicians or film directors.
So you meet lots of people with voices which don't quite fit them, if you do know who they are. So famous Korean actors with Australian accents. I just met Mike Flanagan, director of...
Haunted Hill House.
The various Netflix horror things. Exactly. Yeah, I've just met him.
He gave me a boomerang that hurts ghosts.
Classic Australian behaviour.
And it's just him voiced by someone else.
I want to believe that they got all of the Hitman 2016 NPC guys to do all the Australian voices. And they're like the same few voices you hear over and over again.
Yeah, but that's like one of the thousands of little quirks here. One of the outposts is run by the band Chvrches.
Oh right, yeah.
And they're just there. And I don't really know much about Chvrches.
It's two gruff blokes and that woman in it.
Well, you seem to interact with the female singer and then the two blokes just sort of stand behind her looking slightly kind of, you know, standoffish.
Well, that's Chvrches. That's what that band is.
Maybe that is Chvrches. What I'm saying, though, is that you can enjoy it on this quite basic level of you know that you've got to go to these outposts. You're going to meet weird people.
Every once in a while you meet a bigger character who joins your crew. There's a bit of a crew building. You have a, oh, I don't want to call it a Normandy.
You know, you're not free to walk around in it, but building a crew is part of this story. And that's where some of the bigger actors who you might know are in this. So, L.
Fanning, weirdly George Miller, the director of Mad Max. He gives his likeness to the kind of pilot of the boat. He's called Tar Man.
You've got a living puppet character called Dole Man, who is based on, I think, I think he's like German Turkish director Fatih Akin.
Right?
Obviously. It's like some really nice stuff. But at the 20 hour mark, there's not been anything too out there.
The original game was like drowning in Death Stranding lore. Like you had this basic mission, but you were also constantly aware that Sam Porter Bridges was kind of hiking towards some greater understanding of this apocalyptic situation, where here it feels like he's just trying to fix his personal problems, connect Australia, he meets people who have interesting little backstories which are told in quite nice cutscenes, beautifully animated, amazing motion capture and 3D modelling on the faces and all that. And it's definitely at this point way easier hang than the first game, which is a very long way of saying if you were put off by Death Stranding 1, there is like a chance for you to enjoy this on that level I think.
Well, that is good. You know, I think that I still in my head think with Kojima games you just got to play the whole series of them. So for me, I will finish one and then I will play two.
Which I know is like a long road ahead, but it is how I want to enjoy those games.
It is. I'd be interested to see what happens if you played them in quick succession, because in many ways I think this is probably like the most conservative sequel he's ever done. It is mechanically just a continuation.
It isn't a radical overhaul. There is a jump always between the metal gears. If anyone can see that.
Maybe… no, no, I think that's true. If you have any kind of muscle memory of the first game, you instantly fall into the same habits.
It seems quite easy. I don't know if that's because they've smoothed the edges, or I played 60 Hours of Death Stranding 1 and still know which buttons to press in certain situations, and the general thrust of the action is exactly the same. That isn't a criticism.
It's another reason I think this one maybe hits better from the off. It's that he hasn't taken a hammer to it for no reason. Everything that worked before is here, plus some extra cool stuff that's new.
Well that's interesting. I like the idea of a Kajima sequel that does do that, that is iterative. Because it doesn't sound like it's short of his trademark touches, from everything you're telling me.
The only thing that gives me slight pause with that approach is, it does feel like it's, what innovations it has, or what it has to say, is mainly in the narrative, and in the cutscenes and the characters, where you always get that with him, but you also get a full suite, like a full mechanical suite of new ideas, or things he's been playing with. And sometimes they're intertwined, those two things, the story and the gameplay, quite elegantly. But even if they're not, you're always struck with like the ambition of what he's trying, you know, with both parts.
And I can't say there's anything, you know, mechanically you're like, oh, this is just really neat sequel making, which isn't really, you know, the work of like the great man.
Yeah, but then isn't that kind of a bogus notion anyway, that we're all a bit too obsessed with, you know? And I mean, most sequels are iterative, aren't they, in video games? Maybe it's harder to do when you're working on games of that scale as well.
Maybe this is how you make two games of this scale. I mean, there's like a good five years between the first one and this one. If you don't count, director's cut in the middle.
You know, maybe that is and COVID in the middle of all that. You know, maybe this is how those games happen and get made. But there are definitely moments when you're doing the action side of things, you know, when you're breaking to base with, hilariously, the bad guys are referred to as brigands, which I always think sounds a bit silly.
It's a bit old-fashioned. It's like, there's these brigands over there and you're like, okay. It isn't a very complicated stealth game and if it does turn into an action game, it's quite easy and it's very, very easy to become hugely overpowered with upgraded weapons.
You have a lot of toys in this game. But there are little moments when you're in those sandbox kind of areas and you're sneaking into a base and taking people out with a science pistol or you're doing the VR missions which are basically lifted straight from the Metal Gear series. They were in the Director's Cut 2 but when you're in there, there is this, you know, your heart begins to flutter a little bit like, oh Kojima is going to do another tactical espionage game like he said he's going to and he is really fucking good at it.
Like, it just feels so nice to play and like the weapons feel great and the character movement is so responsive and like what he does with that decimer engine. It just looks so attractive that you think he's still got the juice when it comes to this kind of action. You know, it isn't as sophisticated as a Metal Gear and anyone who tells you that this is like Phantom Pain level is absolutely fibbing their ass off.
But it's close enough for you to be like, yeah, do more of this and like move the needle again, you know?
I don't know, these all sound like smart changes to me, you know, because playing the first Death Stranding, whenever I come across enemies, I'm just like, oh, fuck this. You know what I mean? And it's just like, let's just get the fuck out of here.
I hate this. I want this to be over so I can continue walking across America, quote unquote, which is clearly Iceland, but they're pretending it's America. Which is fine.
I don't mind them doing that. I'm like, this is clearly the opening few scenes of Prometheus right here, you know what I mean? That's what this is, you know?
So yeah, that sounds good to me. Like, I don't need it to be, does anyone want a stealth experience as complex as The Phantom Pain and this? Is that really what this is?
It seems like they've already got, there's already enough to the Death Stranding gameplay mix that something lighter on top of it doesn't seem like a bad idea, you know?
But it was a reminder of how good The Phantom Pain was when you're given a mission and then they say, they give you a big old map and you can see the enemy outcropping that you're going to go to and it gives you like a big old shopping list of equipment to start fabricating and you're building your kit out and your loadout and thinking, oh, am I going to go in like crazy loud or, you know, should I just go in with like absolutely nothing? Should I just, you know, just literally go in with a rope for tying people up and not have the burden of any equipment to like weigh me down and those were kind of tactical decisions which made Phantom Pain feel so electric. And I guess what I'm saying is, is that element of the game is good enough for like the role it has to play in Death Stranding 2, but it also just reminds you like no one else is really as good at that and if he does make another game, which is just that, it'll be good.
He's still interested in like, does this gun feel really good? And does this weapon like fuck with guards in a really funny way? And that sense of like playfulness is really key to any future success with him in my eyes.
That's cool. I mean, look forward to Fizzint, Matthew, in 10 years, no doubt, when that game comes out.
Yeah.
Is that or is Xbox Horror thing, which I don't really believe will ever come out, is my guess with that one.
Yeah, I'm not super bothered about that. I will say if I have one complaint so far, and I am loving this game, I think it's absolutely fantastic. Such a good, smooth journey.
Australia as a physical setting, beautiful. Like it just has more varied landscape. There's this lovely valley called Rainbow Valley, which is full of animals to catch, to then deliver to churches because they run an animal sanctuary, of course.
If you ever want to see two Scottish blokes looking slightly unimpressed at a koala, have I got the game for you. But that valley can also set on fire, because that's like the big thing in this one is like dangerous weather. And like meteorites will rain down and set the whole thing on fire.
And then you're trying to put out the fire with tar guns. And it looks absolutely amazing, of course. Anyway, the thing I have a problem with, and it was actually there's a really good PC Gamer piece of editorial on this.
PC Gamer who are covering this PS5 game an awful lot. I should add, but whatever. It's really, really easy.
I think it's got a lot to do with the kind of asynchronous stuff, because your world gets populated with infrastructure and shortcuts and useful items that other players have left in their world. The way that stuff is like seeded or when it appears in the game, it maybe appears a tad too early. Like, you get to an area for the first time and it's already full of useful bridges and ladders and you think, hmm, I never actually got to play this, you know, oh, natural, as it were.
And you can't really do anything about that. That is part of the magic. I feel like the first game was slightly better at that.
Whatever the algorithm is that goes, yeah, it's time to start pulling in bridges and ladders or whatever. You know, I shouldn't be just walking through these missions absolutely peril-free because ten generous souls went ahead of me and laid the tracks for it. And that seems like a bit of a miss.
You don't really want to turn that off. You can just go offline and all that stuff vanishes, but then the kind of interconnectedness of it is part of the story and part of what he's trying to say and what he's treating. It is part of the game's vision.
I just think he's, I don't know, left the kind of tap on a little too high and it definitely diminishes it a tiny bit.
And there's nothing you can do to control that or change that as a player?
Not that I can see. There are good things people can leave, like bridges, and there are irritating things. You can leave these holographic stickers anywhere, a bit like Dark Souls messages, except they're just like absolute nonsense.
There's no words or guidance to them. They're just like a hologram of a giant yellow duck or whatever. And they're fucking everywhere.
And so you get to Australia, which is allegedly like untouched and no one's been here for years. And it's just full of all this like bullshit that loads of other idiot gamers have left there. And you can get rid of that stuff.
And I just go along deleting it all, like dismantling holograms. Because every time you drive through it, they get a like, which is like a currency in their game. So people are trying to put these things in places they know you're going to have to go so that you can't avoid them to make like a like farm.
So they'll put them in like the doorways to important buildings and things like that. And that is quite annoying. No one can look at the amount of flashing shit that's bleeping at you and spinning and ducks and all this stuff and go, Oh yeah, this is as intended.
This seems right. This seems good. That's the only thing I would change is that if I could, if I could dial that stuff down to like a third of its volume, I think you'd have the right amount.
Yeah. Okay. That's, that is funny.
The idea of like, you know, you've been like, wow, like a meteor ice falling from the sky. Fucking more ducks. Get rid of these fucking ducks.
More ducks. If you piss, like if you take a piss as Norman Reedus, I think it creates like a holographic mushroom where he pisses. But it's got your name on it forevermore.
So you can see that you had like a big old piss.
Yeah.
And because obviously it was reviewed by outlets. Like the stuff which has been in the world the longest, I guess, was the stuff that was left by journalists. So you're quite likely to find like piss mushrooms left by like IGN France and like nothing takes you out of a game, like finding a piss mushroom with the word IGN France written on it.
Just like hosting a press event that, you know. That's funny. I mean, I felt this even playing the original though.
There's that fine line between immersion and letting players inform what's in the environment or what shapes your environmental storytelling experience going through the game. And I guess, like, he reached the point where he's just comfortable with those things being on top of each other. And, you know, it may break your immersion as a player sometimes.
But I guess it's the intended experience. But it's a shame you can't, like, there's not like a slider, like a duck hologram sticker slider. You can slide right down, you know, like a piss mushroom slider.
Can I have 10% of these, please? Interesting, yeah. So does that stuff, that stuff's nowhere near like a, you know, like a deal breaker for you that I'm guessing.
Not at all. I think the first game was a little bit, a little bit harder and it almost needs a bit of difficulty for some of the systems to make sense. Because if you're just driving very easily between outposts using pre-made bridges and highways that have been laid by people, then you don't really encounter anything.
You don't meet any ghosts. You don't meet any brigands. And that is a valid approach, like being an infrastructure first player, I guess.
But I feel like the first game made you work a little harder for that. And maybe just like bled it into the world a bit better. That's that's really my, it's not a deal breaker, but it's like a, you know, there is a there is a better version of this, even beyond this, which is already, you know, it's improved in just about every way apart from that.
Okay, interesting. Well, you have not finished it though yet, right?
Oh no, I think probably about like a third of the way across Australia.
Well, it sounds like you got yet another game jostling for a place in your Game of the Year list, Matthew. So that's, that's exciting for you. I will have takes on the Death Stranding games before the end of the year.
That's my promise to the listeners. I mean, I don't think anything's really coming out now between, you know, like in terms of big games. Perhaps after Bonanza and then Ghost of Yotai.
That's about it, isn't it? Basically for like the, for the year.
I can't wait to see which horror directors turn up in Donkey Kong Bonanza.
Yeah, hopefully James Wan or, you know, or that bloke who directed Don't Look Now. Perfect. All right, lots to think about there, Matthew, as we transition into my first game, which is Rematch, a football game.
Cue all of the listeners turning off, except those 10 sickos in the Discord Sports Channel, Matthew.
Yeah, and not me. I pledge to listen.
Oh, you're a good guy like that, you know. I've always said that about you. You just, you'll hear me out.
So this is a football game where you control an individual player on the pitch. I would say that it's, so, but what's different about it from the likes of FIFA is there's no licenses in it, you know. There's no ultimate team.
There's none of that stuff that has really given football games a lot of baggage, I would say, in recent years.
It doesn't do like the fake PES version.
No, there's no Oranges team that's actually the Netherlands. Like, you know, there's no, yeah, you don't get like Oranges 12 instead of Dennis Berkamp or whatever. It's not that, not that kind of vibe.
It's very much, I would say the aesthetic of it, it's like slightly cartoonish. I would say it's somewhere between. It's got a bit of Rocket League to it.
There are just, there are like these holographic environments that surround the pitch. Every now and then it looks a little Rocket League-y. Probably slightly too Rocket League-y.
Cross with the time in the late 90s when Eric Cantona started playing beach football. It's got like a, cross with like a bit of the old FIFA Street style I guess. It's like cartoony.
Ten people in sports discord are nodding sagely at that.
Yeah it's like, it's colourful but it's got a knockabout in the park sort of vibes to it. I think it is meant to be set in a kind of like, a future where a lot of like climate change stuff has gone down. It's not like there's a narrative to it but it's like implied by what you're seeing.
That holographic environment will change around you from like a park style environment to a stadium, to even like a satellite in space for example. It's quite visually spectacular what it sort of shows you while you're playing. And the actual football experience is very much, so Sloclap are the developers of Sifu and there is a physicality to the way you play football in the game.
That is, I've seen people compare to a beat em up. I don't know if that's quite right but it's very much based on like individual button presses and the way you angle things matter like surgical precision in controls. So for example if a player is running towards you and they tap the B button to tackle you and you don't press any button they will automatically get the ball from you if they've got the positioning right.
However you as the player controlling the ball if you tap A as soon as they slide tackle you you'll knock the ball forward and they might and they'll just try and tackle you but you can still just run and like take the ball again. There's a lot of like basically holding on to the ball letting go of the ball a little bit to get past the player holding on to the ball again and all of the passing and shooting is mega mega precise so I fucked so many shots and passes in this game because I've got I'm basically so what you can what you can do is you can mistake where the camera is facing with where you're kicking the ball and so you think okay I'm gonna kick this straightforward and then what I realized is that the way I've got my thumb on the stick means I've actually just kicked it 90 degrees from where I want it to be and then that's when players on the pitch start spamming good job good job Rocket League star to psych you out and so there is like a steep learning curve to this but that's why it's magnificent because it's a glorious game to unpick right it is like because on game pass it does have that Rocket League on PS Plus circa 2015 thing of enough people are playing this at once to feel like it's happening as a thing you know right and so yeah it's but it is football is obviously there's no there's no none of that like air bullshit in that you get in Rocket League it's all down to like people who are flicking the ball over their head and controlling it people are doing perfectly angled passes and like curving the ball just so and people who are like you know passing at the right time and then and then you and then you kind of have a player there ready to volley it in it's really good at making you play as a team do you only players so you're one person on the team it's not like when you pass the ball you become the person who you pass to no it's not because they are played by other humans it's a 3v3 always it's a 3v3 4v4 or 5v5 game and whichever one of those you pick completely changes the dynamic of how a match plays out 3v3 is I would say it's definitely the recommended beginner level because you can understand the mechanics with a little bit more space between you and other players 4v4 is a bit more when you want to understand like where your positioning is on the pitch like how you should be marking players how you should be thinking about the way the game plays out and then 5v5 is meant to be the like this is like the big boy shit mega tactical sort of like you know it's a bit more like you play in positions I guess I've not dipped into that one yet but yeah it's just mega it's mega precise when it comes down to the actual ball control, parsing and shooting and it's just like wonderfully playable like the sound effects and the visuals and things like that and actually like how it rewards you how you feel rewarded when you get good enough at it to pull off some really good parsers or really good shots it feels different to say like I know I definitely don't you don't play loads of football games these days not but it doesn't feel like if you just really zoomed in on like a modern FIFA it's a very different game of football to that like I guess this is like a guy who knows fuck all about football trying to talk to a guy about football I guess do you think it's trying to capture a different level of football do you think it's trying to capture more of a kickabout than like a professional level football if you can even make that distinction absolutely I think it's about the I think it's about rethinking the mechanics of how football works from like a player perspective because if you think about the way FIFA plays FIFA is like playing I don't want to say this is not quite right but there's a bit of a tactical game element to FIFA.
It looks like an RTS from above.
Well that's it which sounds preposterous but you are controlling multiple players on the pitch and you are thinking about positioning and that kind of stuff on some level it is a tactical experience. This is as well but it's a bit more about how the tactical experience comes from how well do you synergise with other players and if you go in with other human players you will have a fundamentally different experience. I am looking to pull together a little rematch team on Xbox and by the way if anyone out there is actually any mutuals are out there and are playing rematch do give it a go.
I like how you put that open invitation realise who you are talking to the listeners and then quickly reversed out of it.
I like the listeners but I don't want to commit to about 15 different games of rematch and then tell my girlfriend I can't do anything this weekend because I am playing rematch with all these people I have never met before. It's more like if Dave Turner is listening and those boys are playing rematch on Xbox let's make it happen. I am trying to avoid playing for PS Plus again I don't want to pay for that anymore so there is a bit of that to it.
I have the game on Game Pass and there is no cross play yet. They want to patch it in. I mean that will be a huge game changer when they do.
But no to go back to your question, I think it is a bit more like what if we just separate football from all of the branding of football and all of the licensed baggage and it is just a strip down purely about the sport and purely how it feels to be a player on the pitch in that sport in this way that reminds me of playing football at lunchtime as a kid. Right down to similar anxieties I have about I can't fuck this shot in front of this guy because I have already seen him do two more shots. It reminds me of playing football with like these.
There was these brothers in my school like called these the Campbell brothers and they were like and they were really fucking good at real sports and they were all they were all they were good at really pretty much any sport you can name they were good at and I was always a bit like I cannot be seen to fuck this in front of Sam Campbell or it's going to be really like and this game.
Were they twins?
No, one was like a year older than the other.
Oh, that would have been glorious.
Sam was very nice. There was like but they were just sort of like I was like permanently I was worrying more about embarrassing myself than actually being good. I was like I'll do anything not to embarrass myself.
And there's a bit of that in here where I'm like it's much safer if I just do like a really like short range pass to the defender in front of me when I'm still in goal. It's much safer if I pass it here instead of shoot. It's much safer if I just leave it for another player to pick up the ball.
All those anxieties are coming back and I have to like fight those in my brain and be like no no this is not year 11 lunchtime anymore but I never had that with Rocket League. I was always humiliating myself all over the shop but there's something different about it being a guy and not a car.
I can 100% see that. Like who cares what a car thinks?
Yeah that's it.
A car can't like look at you with disdain. I guess the characters don't in this but it's the AIs isn't it?
Yeah but the sort of... When you get anywhere close to that skill setting, when you do something really spectacular in this game, it feels great and it has a few design touches that I think are just really smart and encourage you to play as a team. There's like a big problem with classic...
This is another way in which it reminds me of being a kid. Classic archetypes you get in knockabouts of like goal hanger guys who are just there to try and knock it in without actually properly participating. Those are a problem in this game sometimes.
Bull hogs who will just try and run it up the pitch and then shoot. But there are mechanics. Like if you do a pass that's got like a bit of air to it, then you can do a very...
The other player you pass it to can do a very easy volley shot at the goal. It's like one of the easiest types of goals you can score. And so I think that's in there.
So they get you to think about maybe you should pass here instead of having it go yourself because you'll probably fuck it anyway. So things like that are just really well considered.
That's really interesting. I was going to ask you how much it feels like you can express yourself. Can you see different player types emerge from the same controls that you're using?
Do you get someone who just tries to tear down by themselves and do it without any help? Or is that really punished in the game?
It's not really punished. It all depends on the other team to be able to counter that play. In terms of personality, you can customise the characters.
That does mean that you start to notice, oh, it's fucking long grey haired guy with his prosthetic leg again. In your head, you're like, that guy will flicker over my head every time I try and tackle him because he's really fucking good at it. And then there's like, oh, on your team, like, oh, my goalie keeps running out from his line.
Instead, just trying to have a go at passing the ball up the pitch, and that's going to end in tears when someone lobs him from the halfway line. You do get, you start to notice based on the gamertags, who the characters in a game are. And it's again also defined by people spamming those, good job, good job, good job, when someone completely shits the bed.
So, it's fucking magnificent, man, it's so good. Oh, I love it. It's like become, I had 20 minutes before work this morning and I booted and I just, I was like, yeah, you know, that's enough time for like four games of this because it's got a mercy rule that if you're losing or winning four nil, normally losing in my case, then the match is automatically over.
Or if there's a full goal difference, it's over. So yeah, it's, yeah, the personality side really comes out. And I think the art direction helps with that.
It's sort of like, it just looks so vivid and, yeah, just full of character, you know?
How interesting that like Sloclap have become this, like masters of trying to kind of bottle a very specific physical experience, you know, like a Kung-Fu movie and now football. You know, like, because when they announced they were doing this, I remember thinking, uh-oh, that seems like a bad idea. I had no faith this was going to be good at all.
And yeah, people have just gone absolutely nuts for it. It seems like they've really got the stuff, these guys.
Yeah, they really have managed to do that very, very well. I think it's really interesting as well to see a developer have multiple passions that they use sort of similar design philosophies for. I guess, like, that's not totally right.
They are very different types of games, but yeah, there is something to the physicality that connects the two. There is something to the art direction that connects the two. That sort of slight…
That feeling of these characters could almost be made out of wood. That kind of visual style to it. Yeah, I'm just really impressed that they were like, yeah, we made this beat-em-up, one of the best games of the last five years, in my opinion.
And we're like, fuck it, we'll just go and make this a live service football game with no licences and succeeded, you know?
Are you just all in on them now? Are you like, whatever they do next, you're highly anticipating that day one.
Yeah, absolutely. And I do wonder if like, if this, I mean, I guess I could probably find this out from reading interviews, if this is, you know, all of them who have been making this, and because, or if it's like a separate team, or if it's like a crossover of the two, I imagine it's, they're probably going to make something else, just because, you know, I think Seafood was one of Kepler's like big successes, and, you know, it was a great game, very well reviewed. But yeah, I think it's really interesting to see a studio do this kind of thing.
And to surprise you each time like this, this, between the Obsolver, you know, their first game and Seafood, there's a clear shared DNA. No one would have guessed this would be the next game they'd make, right? And I'll tell you what I am intrigued about with this game, is with Rocket League, I'd say it was very easy to envision how you could do things like limited time modes and all those like different levers that you can pull with a live service game to kind of keep people engaged.
Like the Hockey Puck mode they added to Rocket League, for example. I wonder if it's like harder to come up with those for regular football, you know, what the novelty thing is, like maybe you have a mode where you're kicking around a bomb or something, and then the bomb explodes and...
Two footballs.
Well, that's the thing is I don't, I can't quite envision in my head what that would be, but it's very firmly referred to as season zero in the game. And I think they have ambitious plans to like keep, to keep growing it. And eventually as well, it's worth saying that much like Rocket League, no doubt this will reach a point, this happens with all live service games where the audience that's playing it becomes super die hard over time and the only people playing it are the die hard people.
So when you jump in for a quick match, you don't have that very pleasurable experience at the moment of hitting quick play and not knowing what skill of player you're going to be matched with. Because honestly, I've been matched with all sorts and I've played such varying levels of quality on the pitch. So yeah, it's super cool.
I think it's just got that arcade-y, what seems like an arcade-y pickup and play quality. But I had to do all the training modules just to remember how all the controls work. And you won't remember how to do everything at once.
You have to gradually pick it up as you go. But again, I think that's what's great about it. It's not a game you will 100 percent understand in the first probably 10 matches that you play.
I think it could stretch on and on. So it's good, Matthew. It's good stuff.
It's on all formats and it's about 20 quid. So impressive stuff and has microtransactions. But I'm not that kind of guy when it comes to cosmetics.
So I've completely tuned out of that. I've got a very anonymous looking lad on the pitch for me.
So I'm going to spend 20 quid so I can be Mike Flanagan in goal.
Absolutely. I mean, not with your toe you won't be, unfortunately. But once that's healed, absolutely.
OK, so Matthew, I can't wait to hear about this next game, Date Everything. You've had a key for this for a few weeks. And, you know, I just, it's a game that's gone through the, it's always really interesting when a visual novel comes along.
And I would say gets on the wrong side of people who rightfully get sensitive when the genre is played for laughs, which happens a lot, particularly around April Fool's Day. It's like a common thing that comes up with this genre. I think people feared that with this game, but that maybe it has won people over because it is a game where you can date everything in a house.
But you are a guy who's played a lot of visual novels. I don't feel much of a dating simulator kind of guy as much, but would love to know how you're getting on with it.
It's interesting if whether you'd actually classify it as a visual novel to begin with, because you're in this house, you're in a 3D house, you walk around it, you put on a pair of magic glasses, and then you zap pieces of furniture in your house with the magic glasses. They're called date, dateviators. It's like aviator meets dates.
Some variation on that pun. And then they turn into like an anime character. Just in case you haven't seen anything of this game, don't picture like a sofa with eyes.
Picture like a hunk whose clothes are made out of the sofa textile. That's kind of the energy it's going for. They turn into traditionally sexy humans rather than you're not going out with like a clothes rack with lips, you know?
That isn't the pitch of the game. That would be weird. I mean, it's quite weird as it is.
Not a good one to play in the office. I get a lot of strange looks. A few kind of, what on earth are you playing?
Yeah, so you walk around this house. Every day you have five opportunities to blast people with these love glasses. And then you have to go to bed and they recharge.
Yes, the conversations with them are text boxes and VO and are quite lengthy, which you would associate with a visual novel. But I'd say there's quite a lot of walking around the house and exploring, it's not a super super trad visual novel, if anyone is too obsessed with genre labels. I haven't played many dating romance visual novels.
I've played a couple, I've dabbled with a couple, and they tend to be very lengthy stories where you make a couple of decisions along the way, which you end up then spending more time with one character. You basically, the romances are different branches of the story. This isn't that.
This is like, there's a hundred things in this house you can shoot your love glasses at. Just go and do whatever you want, basically. I don't really know what the end goal is.
If it's like, to date, X amount of the furniture. I don't think it's like date one, or like make one thing fall in love with you, because that can happen quite quickly. One of the first things I clicked on was just a wall upstairs, and they basically fall in love with you just for talking to them, and like acknowledging them, I guess because they're a wall that everyone walks past.
It's not like there are a hundred things, and the aim is to romance one of them. I think it's to sort of like get your head around this community of sexy fucking fridges and ovens and TV remotes. Yeah, very, very odd.
What is this game like?
I'd say the thing which is most interesting about it is it's made by Sassy Chaps Games, which was founded by three voice actors. Ray Chase, who was Noctis in Final Fantasy XV, Robbie Damon, who was Prompto in Final Fantasy XV, and Max Middleham, who was Red XIII in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Remake.
Which one, Matthew? I mean, I guess it's a bit of a spoiler, but which version of Red XIII was he?
Well, it just said Red XIII, so maybe both.
I guess if it was the one that was in Remake, then it would probably be the more gruff one, right?
When you see a picture of him, you're like, probably not the gruff one. Like he looks like he's got a bit more of a... I don't want to cast aspersions on voice actors.
He looks like he's got like a shrill anime voice.
Right.
That would be my guess. And yeah, so they've made this game. Yes, it's about dating and dating with furniture, but each piece of furniture is played by a different voice actor.
So what it kind of it really is is a love letter to voice acting, a celebration of voice actors, maybe like a time capsule of the current voice acting scene. Obviously, not every voice actor in the planet is in it, but a hundred voice actors is quite a lot. And each one has like a showcase, which is they are one quite outrageous character.
I feel like rather than making a game, like a romance game where you date furniture, what they've actually made is a game where you can date probably a voice actor you like. And that's more what it's about. It's about finding the piece of furniture, which is voiced by the person who did the character you liked in the other game and having them talk to you in a romantic way.
I think really that's what's going on here. And that's okay, because there has become this huge cult of personality around voice actors. And people obsess over them and they've become real rock stars.
Whether it's the Critical Role Lot or the Baldur's Gate cast or the Final Fantasy cast. Where this game is at its most interesting is when you're talking to someone and you're trying to work out who they are or if you've heard their voice in another game or if you can recognise them because they're doing a slightly different voice to their normal voice or whatever. One of the first characters I met was the door of the house.
He's called Dory and there's a lot of puns like that. He's like the bouncer. He won't let anyone into the house but he's voiced by Ben Starr.
Then you go into the kitchen and the tumble dryer, I think, is voiced by Neil Newbon who's got a very distinctive voice. He was a starion in Baldur's Gate 3. It's quite fun playing like who's who.
That's more what I'm interested in rather than can I date an ironing board. Maybe that's me being a bit… You know I'm not super into the kind of romance stuff in games.
There's a lot of like sort of performative horniness in this. There's lots of characters who I'm like, eh, it's not really for me but they've all been designed to be screenshotted and shared on Twitter and everything. That combination with voice actors all kind of taking the piss a bit.
I think that is what it's about. You've got a fan base somewhere, come in this game and pretend to chat up your fan. Somewhere someone will get off on that and that is why it's probably doing quite well.
Yeah, I think that's probably true because what I read about it is that it's a celebration of voice actors. That's the kind of like the, it feels like the people who are responsible for that craft, making a game where they can celebrate that craft and maybe that's more meaningful in an age of AI and all the other horrors going on that are just threatening to chip money away from people who are amazingly talented. So that alone, along with the novelty of the premise and the commitment to the bit, I guess you might say about the game, probably.
Yeah, I mean, it is impressive. The character art is amazing. The job that they've done of taking things which are really daft and shouldn't become like sexy people, like curtains or a bin or like a washing up basket full of old socks or whatever.
They've all been turned into, I'd say, like different flavors of romantic interest. Some are quite clean cut. Some are a bit, obviously, like dirt bag and a bit scuzzy.
And I feel like there's probably something in the mix for everyone.
Yeah, that's kind of like a cool approach. Like it's the kind of character art thing is really obvious from looking at it. I sort of like when I heard the premise initially, I did bristle at it and I thought, is this like, does this only exist because of the novelty of these voice actors, you know, kind of like getting involved with this sort of thing.
And then you do you do look at the production values of it. It's genuinely impressive what it is. So, that's cool.
I look forward to going into that house and finding who, you know, my sort of like cursed soulmate is out of that bunch.
Yeah, because the actual like, hanging out with them, you know, you basically just have to, you have to go through their little story arc to strike up a relationship with them. And through those story arcs, they often take you around the house and you get to see different pieces of furniture interacting with each other. And you sort of learn that there are all these sort of strange politics going on.
I guess it's a bit like, if you imagine like what Pixar did with toys, you know, the idea of like, this is what toys do when you're not in the room. The idea of like, what, what personalities and vibes and like grievances would your different pieces of furniture have? So like having a washing machine, having a tumble dryer stacked on top of a washing machine, they're going to be really irritated, basically having this person living on their head, for example.
And like, it's quite cute. I wouldn't say it's hugely dynamic. You know, I am probably just playing to meet new furniture.
Sounds so weird. I'm playing to meet new furniture and hear the voices and, you know, see what characters they've cooked up with. Like, the actual minute to minute of, like, you know, this magnifying glass wants me to go and interrogate a radiator.
I'm like, yeah, yeah, fine. That's not really for me. But I feel like the skeleton of the game, like, what you're actually, your actual aim in it is not really what it's about.
It is about being talked to, not in a really dirty way, by a voice actor that you like. Tonally, it's quite weird. Occasionally, it's like a bit, not rougher, but like a bit more adult.
Like, people start swearing or throwing around, like, slightly more, kind of like, call this coffee machine a slut or something. And you're like, what? And I thought it was going to be a bit more kind of safe than that.
I thought it was going to be quite chaste.
Yeah.
There's like an undercurrent, which makes you think, I haven't got this far with any character, but there is a bit where you're like, is this guy going to like shag a fireplace? What's going on here?
I think like you wondering that is maybe part of the intent of the game, you know, like getting to a point where you might think that might happen. I think that's why it's a way not to go down the mega chaste route, because I think people actually understand what this genre is. Probably most of them are adults, you know.
Certainly anyone I know who plays this kind of game is an adult, but that is funny.
And it does set up like friendship as a goal as well. You know, you don't have to pursue a romantic relationship. I think when push comes to shove, you can choose to opt just to be friends with all these people.
And that's perfectly valid too. And like I say, I feel like they've worked quite hard to make sure different character types and body types and identities are all represented by different kinds of furniture, probably reflected in the voice actors too, I would imagine. It feels like a very carefully cast thing.
Ethnicities represented in their characters and things like that. So, it just feels like too, it's kind of like too harmless enough to be put off by it. And I don't really think it's for me, because I don't really idealise voice actors in this way, you know?
But I've been to Expose, I know how people feel about voice actors, and they have these quite intense relationships with them. So making a game which lets you maybe indulge that a little bit, and the voice actors kind of know, like it feels like Ben Starr is trying to be a bit sexy for someone who might like Ben Starr. And that's kind of funny in itself, you know?
Or like Ashley Burch or Laura Bailey or whoever, you know?
Yeah, and there's like a, I think the structure of it is that they all get royalties based on how it does as well. It's like quite a generous scheme they've set up. So not only is it sort of like harmless, but it's also good for that community to see if they're able to make it a success.
Looking at, cursory glance at Steam, it looked like it was doing pretty well. It was like it was hanging around in the top sellers. And I think it's doing alright on Switch as well, you know?
Overwhelmingly positive on Steam, like several thousand reviews. Yeah, it seems to be doing alright.
I've been really curious to know how it, like what the German versions like. Like, do they have the German versions of all those people? Do they, you know, is German prompto in this game?
You know, who's German Ben Star? These are all questions I'd like to know the answer to, Matthew. Ashley Day will probably send me a DM after this and explain who the German cast are.
So I look forward to that. But I have a key for this as well. I will play it and check it out.
It's the ideal Steam Deck fodder. So it's for me to also look at Matthew. Right there.
Have you ever seen that Simpsons episode where the kids all get those uniforms at the behest of what's his name? Chalmers, Superintendent Chalmers. They all have to wear those uniforms because they're not being well behaved enough.
Then it starts raining and then the gray uniforms all turn to color because of some thing with the material. Have you seen this episode of The Simpsons, Matthew?
Yeah, I've seen that, yeah.
Okay. So that was how I felt when I uninstalled MindsEye last night and went back to playing Rematch. That is that in gaming form.
Imagine white and gray turning to color and joy. It was like, oh, I mean opposite ends of the spectrum. Okay, so MindsEye, we discussed this game a bit before.
It is made by Builder Rocket Boy. I don't want to make light of everything that's gone on with that studio because they have gone through layoffs and the game has had an absolute critical kicking. And we don't sort of revel in kicking games on this podcast.
We like to be fair to the games. What's annoying about this game is that it's not as good as it should be considering at times from different angles how amazing it looks and how high the production values are in it. So this is a third-person shooter that superficially looks like it should be an open world game but it's not because it is barrelling you from location to location with cutscenes and missions.
You can never just wander off in this world. But I would say the open world is very much inspired by Vegas. It's called Red Rock City.
It is like a metropolis in the middle of a desert. It is like a relatively small strip of buildings or some skyscrapers and then a vast amount of desert with not much in it surrounding it. And you will drive across that desert quite a lot in the opening two hours of this game.
So in some ways, this has been compared to the Xbox 360 era derisively because it's a third-person shooter with some driving bits. And the narrative is very 360-coded too. It's also got QTE sequences, which is a bit old-school.
But it's got the sequence where an explosion goes off and the sound warps and the protagonist gets up and wonders what's happening. All these things that you have a sense memory of from your days playing Xbox 360 games. However, it's like the worst version of that.
It's so boring, this game. It's really, really dull. It's like uninventive third-person missions with no real sense of set piece design in dull locations, driving sections of no real friction or excitement that's just gone for ages while an NPC is going to yammer at you as you're going.
Missions where you have to escape somebody who's chasing you. Missions where you have to tail someone for ages by keeping a distance, but don't get too far back and lose your target. Basically your PS2 GTA-style missions.
It's those back-to-back with some very well-produced cutscenes, I think. And story that is like, I would say about 60% of the time, I'm like, oh, it's a story actually alright. I'm kind of curious about where this is going.
It's like a world where it's like a...
Can you name one character from it?
Jacob Diaz, the main character. And I think Seb is his mate with the Dreadlocks. I think that's right.
And then that's it, though. That's it. I've forgotten who everyone else is.
I suppose it's alright. So yeah, it's got this... It starts with this flashback when Diaz was like a soldier.
And this is a weird thing where he's got this, like, he's got this chip in his head that basically lets him interact with technology. And then he finds some kind of symbol in this, like, temple. And it's sort of suggested to be kind of sci-fi that it cuts to the present.
And he's got a job working for this tech firm in security. And he's trying to piece together what happened to what happened in the military back when he was a soldier. And then you will then play some of the most boring third-person shooter bits of all time with no blindfold fire when you're shooting.
No, for what I could tell, no melee attack when you're in the shooting, you're doing shooting either. The most like paired down, dull version of third-person shooting, that just about works. It's not like mega glitchy or anything.
Sometimes the enemy animations are a bit janky, but it mostly works. It's just so dull. It's so dull.
And so, yeah, I mean, this is one of those games where I would have been happy to meet it halfway if it was a good version of the classic 360 experience. But you're way better off waiting for the Gears of War, for Rebake to come out, or the Remaster, because you will remember what a good version of that kind of game with proper pacing, inventive set pieces actually looks like. Because it ain't this, dog.
You watched Catherine play this, right?
Yeah, she played loads of it, and she passed me the controller a couple of times because I just wanted to feel, you know, what does the driving feel like and whatnot. Every time I looked up at the screen, she seemed to be driving around this car factory.
Right.
Because the guy works at some big factory plant and big production line, and all the missions either end or begin there, so you're constantly going back to this place. It's got a real... They just needed to vary up the story so you aren't constantly getting drawn to this place, which she was always getting lost in.
The amount of time I looked up, she was just driving laps of this empty, generic warehouse, getting frustrated that she couldn't find the exit. That wasn't a good sign. I will say, when she got out to places and it became a third person shooter, you could tell that it wasn't great for all the reasons you've said.
There's not a big diversity of moves or weapons. The enemy seemed very flat or boring. But if you squint, it didn't make you realize that the third person shootouts in even a new GTA, they aren't that different.
It's a location with a load of people jumping out from behind trailers. You can see a through line from GTA to this, I think.
You can. But what's annoying about playing it is you're like, why didn't you just ditch your everywhere nonsense and make this one game good? Because, like you say, it's funny, Squinter, and sometimes it seems like a better game, is the best thing you can say about MindsEye.
Yeah, you're just like, well, if you'd just not made all that Fortnite style bullshit and just made this one thing good, would that not really put you in a... Would that not have actually done all right? Because it seems like this game's come out, it's made no money, no one likes it.
And so make one good thing and not like two things badly. Is what should have happened with this game. But it feels like they...
Yeah, go on.
And if you find these portals through the story, which take you into like side stories, I guess, or flashbacks. But they are also, if I've read this correctly, well, I understand this correctly, they are kind of adverts for what you can make in the level creator software. But they are universally dogshit.
Like what they take you to is like, here's four buildings and there are 12 soldiers, and you just have to run around these four buildings and shoot at 12 soldiers and it's over. And if you're meant to go through those portals and go, this was made in the same engine as the rest of the game. It doesn't have that impact.
This makes your level creating software look terrible.
Yeah, it really does.
Whatever's coming down the line with that, that just feels like it's dead on arrival if you've played the single player campaign of this, because it's very bland. I mean, there's one where it was like, I think she was just like shooting people on an intersection. They were just like driving up and getting out of a car.
They were like rival gang members or something. And it looked like the worst death match in like GTA Online. Like there was no sort of structure to it.
There was no like level design. Oh, so bad.
Yeah, it is. The thing is like you say the thing with GTA is, I actually missed GTA while I was playing this. You are right that if you play GTA Online, you play a lot of missions where there is no hand crafted design to it.
It is just a load of NPCs you come here, you have no where. But you do miss the ways in which enemies will gradually die, where like they might go down, the physics kick in, that sort of thing. Here they just sort of ragdoll and nothing interesting happens.
So I missed that level of interaction too. Also, I was thinking, why the guns in this so boring? It's like it's meant to be a near-futuristic tech dystopian or utopia or whatever it is, and they still just have machine guns and pistols.
I was thinking, you got these drones and shit flying out, could you have done something like Fortune's Railgun from MGS2? Why is that not in this game? Why not go full ratchet and clank with the firearms to at least make the shooting more interesting?
Because GTA did do that, it has automatic shotguns. In GTA Online, they added that fucking, they got multiple alien laser weapons. It's got fun firearms, isn't it?
And Rockstar has always got, especially post-GTA IV and onwards, they've got that that is an essential ingredient. Here, it's every decision they've made is so pedestrian. It's just such a dull game, man.
Where's Mike Flanagan with his blood boomerang?
It is like the other end of the blockbuster scale to that. But actually, it's just a shame it's entered in tears, because again, I feel like this has been such a long time in the works, and it's such a wet fart of an end product to put out to people.
It's grim, and obviously, I'm bummed for everyone involved in this and whatever comes of them. I'm kind of glad that we're past it in a way, because it was quite sour, like the week around release, just everyone kind of lining up to take their turn. I think everyone on the planet knew this was busted, but people were like, a week after it came out, were like, oh, here's another one-star review.
It's like, we just don't need this, you know?
Yeah.
People should have used their editorial budget to elevate something lesser known, rather than just kick the big old mess that everyone knows about. It's my hot take.
Yeah, completely agree. Well, there you go. That's MindsEye.
It all ended in tears, but it is off my hard drive now, and I can go back to Rematch, which makes me happy. So, we come to your final game of the episode, Matthew. Available now on WiiWare.
It's Pipstrello and the Cursed Yoyo. How many WiiWare points is that, Matthew? That's 1200?
2000? How many is it for this one?
I'd like to see the guys who sing the eShop song fit Pipstrello and the Cursed Yoyo into their rhyme scheme. Pipstrello and the Cursed Yoyo. Yeah, no, this is on PC, Switch, Xbox, PlayStation.
I think it's on everything. They call it a Yoyovania, whatever that is. I call it a 2D top-down Zelda-like.
I tell you what it's actually really like, which is maybe useful if you played the demo of it at Steam Next Fest. It's quite like Mina the Hollower from Yacht Club Games, which we talked about in our... Was that a Patreon episode?
No, that was... Oh yeah, it was actually. It was our most anticipated games episode, last month's Patreon episode.
Yeah, Mina the Hollower in that it's kind of... Yeah, 2D top-down controls a little bit like a, you know, Link's Awakening or Link to the Past, but also has a slightly kind of harder kind of combat edge to it, which is maybe a bit more true to a Castlevania, so that's why it feels like those things mashed together. It has like a Game Boy Advance aesthetic, like colour palette.
It's, you know, very, very chunky sprites, quite handsome, fills the TV quite nicely. I can't work out if you're a bat or a rat or a mouse or something. You've got like big ears and rodent energy and a yoyo.
You can swing the yoyo at things, but you can also swing it at angled surfaces and it will like rebound and go off at an angle. And through that you can send it bouncing off through these kind of different angled edges to sort of send it through mazes to get enemies or solve puzzles. You can also throw the yoyo and it will go flying off and collect objects.
The way that they take the yoyo and sort of spin it out and add different moves to it, add different puzzle mechanics to it. So far a couple of hours into the game has been quite nice. It's not like Zelda at this point where you're collecting loads of different items.
It's more like we've got this one yoyo, we're going to make it really sing. A bit like the spade in Shovel Knight, I guess, along the meaner, the hollower lines. It's quite difficult, I'm finding.
I don't know if I've just got very slow reflexes, but I die a lot. It's quite forgiving, though, in that when you die you don't go back to a save point, you just restart the screen. So the vibe of it is like solving it one screen at a time, whether that's a weird little puzzle or loads of enemies swarming in.
It has quite a cool upgrade system where you sort of put a down payment on a permanent upgrade, or you get loaned it, and until you've paid it off you suffer a restriction elsewhere. You buy an upgrade for one more attack point for $200, and until you've collected $200 in-game to pay it off you've got half health until then.
Fucking hell.
Does that make sense?
Well yeah, it just sounds like quite a strict kind of parameter.
It is quite strict because you're looking at things and I don't know if you're meant to weigh up the plus point of eventually having that thing versus the difficulty of earning the money with that restriction. Some of them are like harsher than others. Like some mean enemies won't drop any extra health until you've paid this off or things will hit twice as hard or whatever.
But I don't know, it's kind of an interesting little spin on the system. Makes you think twice, which I'm not going to pretend it's like revolutionary or anything, but it's a little bit of colour which I don't recognise from another game. But I'm enjoying it.
I don't know if it's just because I'm really excited for the mean of the Hollow and it's scratching that itch. Maybe a little bit talky, a little bit zany in its humour. Can't say the music's particularly doing it for me.
It doesn't feel like it's a secret 10 out of 10 or anything, but it's pretty solid and I like that all the yoyo attacks have got the names of yoyo techniques that people used to do in the playground, gave me flashbacks to being shit with a yoyo and all the things that I wasn't able to do. Like walk the dog. Did you ever walk the dog?
Yeah, I walked the dog. I could do that. That was pretty easy though.
Did you ever have one of the yoyos that had those fucking ball bearings and springs in them and shit? Because those are the ones that would like spin eternally basically. But if you had a yoyo that didn't have any of those in it, just a regular bit of plastic.
I had a cheap ass like basic bitch yoyo. The only trick I could do is dead dog hanging on a sad rope.
Yeah. Do you remember? Yeah.
That's activated all kinds of memories. I remember, do you ever watch that show Recess, the Disney show? Were you probably too old for it, weren't you, when that came along?
No.
Maybe borderline.
Hang on. Am I thinking of Hey Arthur?
That's Hey Arnold. You're getting two shows mixed up there, Arthur and Hey Arnold. Arthur is that weird bear rat thing.
Yeah. Some kind of mammal in a jumper.
There's rat, there's Hey Arnold and then there's Recess.
Hey Arnold. The premise of Hey Arnold is this lad's got a really strange head and he's got some mace.
Oh, he's got a football head.
He has. That's the premise of that show. Recess is just a show about what happens at Recess in a US school playground.
But the idea is that there's a load of like, it's a bit like Simpsons in a school in some ways. It's like all these politics, ridiculous politics to the school playgrounds that the main characters are trying to navigate. Like there's a king of the playground and things like that.
There's a snitch. There's a group of girls called the Ashley's, very kind of like Mean Girls before Mean Girls vibes. But all the girls have in common is that they're all called Ashley.
And that's a little like gang of these girls that go around. That's basically what the show was. Did you ever watch that?
I am familiar with it, but...
Oh, this is so not worth it. But there was a fake yoyo trick in that. It was like the premise of a whole episode.
I think it was released right when yoyos were huge, where there's like a contest to do the invisible... I think it's called the Invisible Man or something, where you have to make a pair of shoes move on the ground using a yoyo. And so it's like an invisible man walking along.
And so I remember these kids in my playground trying to do that fucking trick, like just banging yoyos against these Clark's shoes that were not moving, being like, I'm trying to do the invisible man. That just unlocked that memory, Matthew.
One of my kind of repeated bits during my younger school days was anything I wasn't good at or wasn't allowed to collect. So like, you know, I wasn't good at yoyo, you know, I wasn't allowed to buy like boglins or monsters in my pocket.
Right.
And so I would capitalise on that by setting up a gang that was anti that thing. So like an anti-yoyo group or anti-boglin gang or anti-monsters in my pocket. And I did that a lot.
So it was just like quite a bitter, bad vibes, 10 year olds pretend like leaning into the fact that I wasn't allowed something and making it look like it was intentional.
Yeah. OK, so Death Stranding 2 has got the brigands, but Death Stranding 3 is going to have the anti-boglin lot. That's going to be like the anti-boglin lot.
It's me and Mike Flanagan, one of the quiet guys from Chvrches of Wallaby.
What an amazing, amazing stuff.
Absolutely like the shittest Avengers Assemble ever.
Well, for the sake of these developers, I'm glad they got this game out before Meena the Hollower comes along, because it will probably eat the lunch of anything that vaguely looks like this, just because of the devs involved. And yeah, like the yoyo kind of premise of it is kind of cool. Like it's, yes, it looks all right.
It looks like a perfectly good summer sort of like filler game to pick up, you know?
Yeah, it is. Like the whole idea of like a yoyo that you can upgrade and does loads of cool yoyo things, that feels quite true to the GBA aesthetic. You know, I like the sort of late 90s, early noughties energy of, you know, it's a game where you have to use a football to fight all the enemies.
You have to use a yoyo to fight all the enemies. That's quite well observed. And it's got enough like modern tweaks or things that like a GBA game couldn't do.
In the same way that Shovel Knight was like a kind of, you know, HD NES game, it was beyond what the NES could do. There's definitely like the amount of pickups and enemies on screen in this or often, you know, they would make a GBA explode. But so it's quite fun to see like the maximalist version of that look, which is like very much that's Yacht Club's thing as well.
But yeah, this will tide people over quite nicely.
It's funny how it looks like the sort of character designs you would normally despise as well. So one of us made the game type is maybe like, and the GBA aesthetic has helped you get over that hump a little bit.
I just don't know what it is. I think I'd like it if I knew it was a bat. I might like it less because I'm not into bats.
But at the moment, it could be a rat and I'm like, well, whatever.
Okay. Well, fair enough, Matthew. That's a nice little addition though.
I think that's the sort of thing that like five listeners will be like, oh, thanks for that, Matthew. I'm going to go off and buy that immediately. So those people can go enjoy that and report back, no doubt.
Okay, cool. So my last game is Helldivers 2. You've heard of this game.
I'll be very brief on this. Basically, my little co-op group who I occasionally pick up and play games with, Phil Savage, who is a PC Gamer, has been on this podcast before, and Tom Hatfield. We are always cycling through the different things.
I'm the less reliable one. I disappear for a month and then I arrive in their DMs and go, hey, can we play games again? It's been a little while.
So we basically decided Helldivers 2 would be worth a punt because beginning of last year, this came out, it was absolutely huge. I think it's fair to say that the experience got repetitive reasonably quickly. It's not a huge amount of depth to what you do when you go down to a planet in Helldivers.
You basically do the same few objectives, you kill a bunch of enemies, you leave again. The fun is obviously the different ways in which you can kill the enemies and that sort of thing. But now that more than a year has passed, they have dropped a few major updates to the game.
I think most recently the one that they've rolled out is called Heart of Democracy, so they've added a new enemy type to the game. I believe they're called the Flesh Mob, which is a very cursed name. They're a bit vague.
They seem to be a sort of fleshy aliens, but there's one that's kind of like a UFO thing that does like an airstrike on you. They're quite a fun addition, I would say. They do change up the game a little bit.
So you've now got these bug things, these robot things, and these fleshy monster things. But they've also added more built up locations for you to explore and fight in and to complete objectives in. So planets are a little bit less desolate, and they've added fucking loads of DLC weapons to it.
That's the thing I didn't realize they've been doing. There's like five or six different war bonds, which are basically sets of unlockables you can pay to access. So they got all these poison themed ones, and this one gives you a fire mech or whatever.
It's like a bunch of different ways in which you can play the same things over and over again. You can either spend money on those, you can collect enough in-game currency to unlock one, yada yada. What is cemented in my head is that Helldivers 2 is the perfect game to go back to in the exact interval that we have.
So every 18 months, go in, play about 10 hours of it, and you're done for like 18 more months. I'm convinced that's what the trajectory of this game is. And I think that's good because I don't want live service games to be like, play me every day, you got these daily things to do.
Oh, I don't want any of that shit. I want to log on to be absolutely fucking spaffed with like medals and shit, even though I've not done anything. That's what happened on login.
Yeah, that's great, yeah. Yeah, just notifications about, oh, you did this, you did this. I did no such thing.
I've not played this game in 18 months, but the game's like, oh, you did this. It's like, I did not, but thank you for the medals. And so, but that works because I think that as that kind of like MGS5 style third-person shooter experience that you share with friends, it's perfect to jump into and be a good conversation game and to remind yourself of how good it is to call in an Airstrike in one of these games and then to maybe unlock a toy you've not played with before.
Yeah, so I just wanted to point out Matthew that they have updated this. It does feel noticeably different. If you've got this game, I would say, and you enjoyed it as much as I did last year, jump in, it's got a bunch of new stuff.
The air strike thing is really fun because having an enemy run at you like these flying enemies do. They basically, there's a little blue, quite like a large blue area they show you, that it runs past and bombs that blue area, but any enemies that are caught in it will be killed. So you can run and use the enemy's weapons against it, basically, to deal with these new types of enemies.
And that is so different to what the bugs and the robots do, which definitely feel rudimentary after playing it last year. So that's just a little update for you, little dispatches from the front lines of Helldivers 2, Matthew.
I do occasionally listen to the Helldivers music on YouTube. That's my relationship with it. It's just such a banger, the central theme.
It is good. And you just forget that like the... I mean, it's basically the Avengers theme, which you hate, which is still one of those paradoxes I don't understand.
I hate the Avengers theme, but like the theme tune to this. But I do agree, all those touches just make it super fun. Every now and then, there'll be like a...
interact with this bit in the environment, and there'll be like a bit of lore, and I'm like, ah, no, no, no, no, we're not doing that. I'm not interested in what your narrative team has been up to. I don't care about any of that.
I'm just here for the toys, strictly here for the toys and the things I can destroy. So those are the games, Matthew. I feel like a good comprehensive little episode.
Yeah, plenty on Death Stranding 2 there. Like I said, I will play those games so I can engage Matthew more. I definitely realized that our stronger episodes this year of what we've been playing has been when we both played something.
This is just one of those examples where I'm behind on something and have not been able to play it to the extent that Matthew has.
One other tiny annoying thing about Death Stranding 2, ages ago I changed my Gamer Tag. When I was working on PlayStation Access, I needed a different Gamer Tag for a joke in a video. So I changed my PlayStation Tag or whatever it's called from Mr Basil Pesto to something stupid like Mung Bean 2001.
So everything I do in that game that gets imported into other people's games, which could include the listeners, it doesn't say Mr Basil Pesto on it. So it's not identifiably as mine in an easy way. It will say Mung Bean 2001 on it.
I just want to let the listeners know, if you are playing it and you're driving across a stretch of road and it says this was built by Mung Bean, that was me, I just are too lazy to change it back to Mr Basil Pesto.
Amazing. Mung Bean, we will remember your contributions. That's amazing.
Okay. Good stuff, Matthew. I did enjoy hearing you talk about that.
What a curious old sequel that is, bringing fucking koalas to churches. I mean, you can't say his games aren't singular. Who else is doing that today?
No one. Okay. This episode is over.
Thank you so much for listening. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am not Mungbean. I'm MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both of those. The podcast is The Back Page pod on Twitter and Blue Sky, where we can keep you updated on new episodes, which this month include two guests, one returning and one new.
I think those would be great. We've got Jen Simpkins coming back on the podcast next week. Can't wait for that.
We're going to talk about the art of video game character customization. There'll be a bit about cosplaying his video game characters in there as well. Just generally want to hear more from Jen because she was fantastic when she came on probably three years ago now, I think it was.
Excited for that. A former Imagine colleague, I've definitely been saving for a rainy day, Matt Handrahan, who is a great talker and storyteller, now works at Kepler Interactive, so worked on Expedition 33. Interesting guy.
Looking forward to having him on as well. There's a draft episode on the Excel too this month. If you'd like to back us, patreon.com, such as £4.50, and it's the Shuttered Studios draft.
Unfortunately, more and more of those are being added to the criteria for that draft all the time, which is a sign of the terrible moment we're in in the games industry, but it's definitely designed to pay tribute to those studios and the games that they created. So yeah, the likes of Monolith, etc. was kind of like what we were thinking when we came up with that.
And there's also an XXL episode on our favorite movies of the 21st century, inspired by the New York Times' recent list feature. Matthew, is there anything else this month that I'm missing? There's probably an episode in there, I forgot.
The absolutely crucial one for me is the Donkey Kong Judgment episode.
Yeah, Donkey Kong Bonanza brackets, it has to be better than Ashdrey bot. That's coming up later this month as well. I cannot wait to hear what Matthew says about that.
That's going to be a great podcast in that. Whatever happens, I know it's going to be good. The podcast, not the game, I have no idea about the game.
But the podcast, gold. Look forward to that and we'll see you next week. Goodbye.
Bye.
