Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, for the first time, we have a second Matthew on the podcast. I don't really know what to do about that.
Oh, I don't like it.
Logistical fucking nightmare. Given how many of them are in the games industry as well and the games media, I'm surprised it's taken this long. But I guess this week it's Matthew Handrahan, Portfolio Director at Kepler Interactive, former Editor-in-Chief at GamesIndustry.biz, and former Features Editor of GameStm Magazine, which is where I first met him.
How's it going? Matthew Handrahan.
Yeah, I'm good. Weirdly enough, the reason why I largely refer to myself as Matthew is because I was in companies where there were so many Matts, it became necessary for me to have the longer version of my name just so that I could stand apart from the three or four other Matts in the building because Matts seems to be people's default. I don't know if that's the same with you, Matthew, but it was the case with me.
For me, it goes back to being one of four Matthews in a lot of my classes in secondary school and that's when I became a Matthew to not be a Mat and carried it forward.
Yeah. It's funny. Doing the panel with you last week, Matthew Handrahan.
I didn't remember how I used to refer to you. I thought, did I used to call him Handrahan to his face or did I used to call him a Mat? I can't even remember because it was so long ago.
I think we were younger men back then, Samuel, and I think there was a tendency to drag the secondary school tendency to name each other by surnames back then. I remember it being Denton, Banda, Miller, Burns, that kind of thing. It was very surname-focused to suit the rather kind of...
Well, we can get into it. Could have been more mature environment of that particular office. But I'm sure we'll be covering that aplenty as we go forward.
But yeah, I think it probably was Handrahan most of the time, or one of the many nicknames I had around then, Handyman, or Super Hands, or Mandrill Hands, or just so many different different monikers that I had over those four or five years.
Yeah. It was so strange to hear the word Matthew coming out of my mouth to refer to you on stage. I was like, oh, that is definitely his name, right?
I asked myself that in the moment because I thought, I don't think I've ever called him that before. And so it did just sound wrong somehow. Yeah, it is.
Well, I've never really been too bothered, one or the other, Matt or Matthew. Just so long as people, I'm aware that that person is talking to me and not the other, Matt or Matthew in the room, then that's the main thing that I'm bothered about. But yeah.
I've asked Sam to call me Castle, Mr. Castle, for the duration of this podcast.
Well, if we slip back to Handrahan, I won't take any offence at Samuel, so go for it.
I appreciate that. Well, it's delightful to have you on, Matthew, Handrahan version.
Pleasure to be here.
Yeah, I mean, you've been on my list of guests. Everyone's convinced if I didn't ask them on in the first year, I didn't want them on the podcast or whatever, but I've really been rationing out my best guests. I've always wanted to have you on, but I was waiting for a rainy day basically.
So delighted to have you on. Got loads to ask you about. So before you worked in games media, you had an interesting history.
I remember when we worked together, you tell me a bit about how you studied screenwriting, I think. I'd love to know what your relationship to games was growing up, and the journey through your younger years.
Well, I think probably my younger years was when I was the most keen player of games. I'm relatively old even compared to the two of you, no matter how much you bang on about your advancing years. I've advanced beyond both of you.
So I'm 44 now, which means 1981. And I can remember playing games in the mid 80s, for example, ZX Spectrum 48K was the first computer I remember having, which was a very interesting time for the British games industry. It was a bit of a lawless wild west kind of industry back then, lots of very hastily made games.
Games that potentially you couldn't finish, games made very badly based on popular licenses with kids exactly like me in mind. A handful of colors on the screen, nothing looked like the thing it was supposed to look like. But I found it all quite captivating back then.
And my family was always quite good at keeping up to date with computers of some one kind or another, though never really console stuff. Like we were a ZX Spectrum, then moving on to Commodore Amiga, Amiga 500, 600, 1200, the early Pentium PCs. I mean, this is kind of my diet as I moved through my childhood and into adolescence and was playing a lot of games.
So it wasn't really, but we did have Sega consoles. I've never, until I bought a Switch, I'd never owned a Nintendo console, which puts me on the, definitely like the mirror opposite of you Matthew. But I mean, I had access to them, right?
Like I played plenty of Nintendo games over that time period and since, but if I wanted to play, you know, Super Mario Brothers 3, I'd have to go around to my sister's best friend, Marie's house and play it there. Or, you know, Mario Kart and GoldenEye, I'd go to my friend Steve's, he had an N64. So it was kind of that thing, like I think, but this must be quite common, right?
That, you know, your parents can afford to buy you. Well, for my parents, it was simple. It was like they found it more comforting to buy a computer that you could theoretically do word processing on something because that felt like a more sensible purchase.
I think that's quite a common thing with kids of that era. And they were willing to kind of stump up for one console, but not both. And we always got the Sega stuff, because I think it was just a little bit cheaper or a lot cheaper.
I'm not even sure what the difference is, but I got a master system with Alex Kidd and Miracle World loaded onto the console. I remember that quite clearly. And then we did have a Mega Drive as well.
But I think by the time the console era kind of entered its next phase with PlayStation, the era of my parents buying me consoles had kind of ended. And we were a PC house, first and foremost. So a lot of my playing back then was on the PC games at the time, you know, in the kind of the mid 90s, I guess.
So I remember clearly the shareware version of Doom, for example, playing Quake for the first time. Games like the LucasArts games were really, really big for me. All of those point and click adventures, Simon the Sorcerer and Beneath the Steel Sky and all of that.
I really loved Bullfrog's early stuff was pretty formative for me. I played, endlessly played Syndicate. I loved Theme Park.
I mean, just lots and lots. So like a great diversity of different things, since the sensible software games, sensible soccer, sensible world of soccer, cannon fodder, lemmings, you know, they're real classics. I don't know how much of this stuff really made it outside of the UK or certain parts of Europe.
But I don't think, like the people I've worked with from the US don't seem to have as great a knowledge of that kind of home computing stuff from Britain. I think that was much more console focused, but this is the stuff I know the best. And it definitely the, yeah, but kind of the only stuff I really had access to, I guess.
It's difficult, I think, to play, I don't know, Super Mario World when you only have half an hour with it every three or four weeks. So, I definitely experimented with a lot of that, I tried a lot of that, but it wasn't definitive of why I was forming my taste as a player, I guess.
Yeah, yeah, really interesting history. I could never, it's funny, because I don't think we ever really chatted much about this stuff when I did work with you, because I knew how you thought about the games in that moment, but I suppose we are still in games kind of like growing up phase, so there was no real need to look back quite so much. But I felt like you always had an eye on what was next, which is what I liked about working with you.
I remember the games of that period just being of hugely variable quality, I suppose. You would have, say, something like Command and Conquer, or the first couple of Warcraft games, which were excellent. But there would be an awful lot of games that were doing something quite similar that were nowhere near as good.
I feel that games were still figuring themselves out in terms of genre and what was or wasn't possible. For throughout the 90s, really, and that started to solidify a bit more in the 2000s. I mean, I think that's the industry became a bit more organized and games became a bit easier to define in terms of categories by then.
I think you have fewer and fewer new genres being pioneered as time goes on. But back then, it kind of felt like there was always something new happening. But that takes a lot of experimentation and a lot of things that don't quite work.
And yeah, particularly in that late 80s, early 90s period, there was a lot of questionable stuff out there. And I got burned a bunch of times. I mean, even as a kid, and I wouldn't trust almost any of my taste before I turned 16.
But even back then, like I remember buying games and just being, you know, horrified by how poorly made they were or how difficult they were, how unbalanced they were. Like I said, it was kind of a Wild West kind of era. And I think that definitely was the case until, you know, Nintendo, Sega, and then PlayStation started to become bigger players in the market.
The attention had gone completely from PC by the time I joined the press, and well before that as well. And I think that was part of it, that the growth of the console platforms had kind of sucked all the air out of the room, as far as that was concerned.
Yeah. Funny how that would eventually turn again, but yeah.
Yeah, yeah, totally. But I think by 16, by sort of 1997, I started to drift away from it a bit. Now I would still check in, but that was the year that I left secondary school.
I went to an all boys grammar school in Southend-on-Sea in Essex. Oh, I guess that's something else I should say, is that I grew up in a seaside town. So I also had a solid kilometer of arcades about a miles walk from my house.
So I played a lot of games there and definitely in the 90s, there was nothing that would compare to them in terms of home computing, right? There was no home console that could give you Virtua Fighter, that could give you Point Blank or any of the things that I would go and play every single weekend. So that was another part of it.
But I think around 15 or 16, I just started to get very into cinema and I know you Matthew, and also have this as a big part of your cultural diet. Like I saw Pulp Fiction when I was about 14 years old. And from that moment on, that's the thing that really lit up my imagination was film more than games.
And I left secondary school to do A levels at a much worse quality educational establishment that happened to offer film studies and media studies A levels. So at that point, I spent solid five years studying film. And when you're doing that, the appeal of games starts to wane a little bit, I think, just because if you're doing it for education, you imagine yourself a future, like a career in that field.
You know, whether you end up being Quentin Tarantino or not, and I did not, obviously, but you kind of need to chuck yourself into it and you need to watch a lot. So I was watching, yeah, we were studying, you know, German, silent German expressionist cinema when I was 16 years old, you know, so it was a bit of an eye-opener in terms of seeing the history of a very established form of media and just finding endless, endlessly fascinating new things to discover and spending all of my money on that, going to the cinema a lot, buying, at the time, VHSs and then as that moved to DVD, DVDs, and never really having an awful lot of money around. So it was just came more and more and more difficult to keep up to date with video games.
And that, I guess, continued from the age of 16 right up until about 22, 23, I think. Yeah, something around there.
Yeah, that's quite an interesting history because, yeah, that's what I always liked about working with you, is that you had a slightly different cultural palette to a lot of the other people I imagined. I think we were all people whose primary interest was games, and I always got the impression with you that games were a secondary interest compared to, you know, maybe like one or two other things. And I think as time has gone on, you know, the cultural criticism sphere has needed more people like that.
So, yeah, an interesting thing to take into games journalism with you. So how did you end up getting hired by Games TM from there?
My kind of lapse back into games happened about middle of the way through university. When I went home from university, I would always go and see my friend Fred, who lived on the same street as my family home. And he always had consoles, right?
So I go to his house and play whatever, the new GTA or Shenmue, all kinds of games, right? But never a great length and never to any extent where I really felt like I got to grips with them. Then I remember playing Halo somewhere, the first Halo game, and becoming quite smitten with it.
And that was the first console I'd owned in since maybe the first PlayStation. So I bought one of those and played a lot of Halo Combat Evolved at the university with my friend Ben. And yeah, it got really into burnout as well.
And there were just a few games that kind of reminded me, well, first of all, they illustrated that the games had actually leapt forward since the last time I'd really paid attention to them. Also kind of showed me that online was going to be something that was, I mean, we'd played sort of lamb parties when I was at secondary school. But this, you know, but online play and the promise of that also signals something interesting happening.
So that was me kind of getting back into it. So by the time I graduated, and it was immediately apparent that I wasn't going to be a screenwriter of any note. And the difficulty of doing that was going to be, you know, astronomical.
My girlfriend now actually is a screenwriter. And she finds it laughable that any university promised a group of 18-year-olds that they could train them to be screenwriters in any useful way. People with absolutely no life experience, no stories to tell, nothing to draw their dialogue from or anything would just go there.
And it was just, you know, that class was just a bunch of people who, like me, had seen Quentin Tarantino's films, had seen True Romance, had seen Kevin Smith's stuff and just thought that they could go in and learn how to do that. And what we were confronted with in the pre-Netflix, pre-HBO era was a future where the best we could possibly hope for was a staff writer on Coronation Street. And that class, I think, I think there was a maximum half of that class left by the end of the three-year course.
But I definitely stuck it out, but I think I was under no illusion that that couldn't lead to anything for me in the longer term. So, I was living in Bournemouth at that time, which is where I went to university. And I discovered that there was actually a magazine publisher on Richmond Hill, which was, at that time it was called Highbury Entertainment.
It wasn't called Imagine Publishing. Oh, actually, no, I think the Highbury office was somewhere else in Bournemouth. So, I applied for jobs at various magazines at Highbury.
And they had the old, they had, they had what became the Imagine portfolio of games magazines for reasons that I will, I'm about to explain. I got offered a, an interview on one of their PS2 magazines, which I, I got a couple of rounds in, but I ultimately didn't get. I think because I was asked to name one game, which I really, that I played recently, that I really didn't like.
And I said Medal of Honor Frontline, because I played a bunch of Medal of Honor, Medal of Honor Allied Assault, a university on a friend's very, very good computer and being absolutely knocked out by the D-Day sequence in that game. And that's the Infinity Ward team, right? Made that game.
And I played Medal of Honor Frontline and the obvious compromises that had to be made to make that work on PS2 were immediately clear to me. And I just found it like an extremely disappointing experience. And that was my take, but I found out that in two issues previously, this magazine had given the game 10 out of 10 and said it was an all time classic.
So that put paid to that job opportunity. And then I kept an eye on what was happening at the company and looked out for a decent opportunity. And then one day they advertised for roles on a new film magazine that they were starting, which for me was far, far better fit for what I wanted to do than games.
I mean, I read CVG and Games Master from time to time, but the magazines I kept every issue of were Empire and Total Film and even kind of more niche stuff that no longer, that didn't last very long, magazines like Neon and stuff like that. So I would hoard film magazines and read everything, read every single one of those. So the idea of like working on a new one was obviously very appealing.
I got the interview for that. Did really well. I mean, I felt really confident about getting it and I did get it.
Hired by a guy called Paul Morgan, who would become my editor. But after being offered the job and before getting the contract actually signed, someone else at the company had decided that they wanted to be a writer and had been given the job I had been hired for. And I was told that the only role they had available for me was as a sub editor, which I wasn't 100% happy with, but I felt like it's a foot in the door.
So I took it. That job ultimately only lasted about four months because Highbury was already in dire financial straits. Maybe it was closer to six months.
Anyway, it was relatively short. I think we managed that the magazine actually ended up being called DVD Next. This was a time in history where DVD magazines were evidently seen as a sustainable enough market for one company to have more than one of them.
I think Highbury had a couple at the time already and felt the need for another. So we got this magazine idea together. We got the first two issues out.
But by then I think the writing was already on the wall. The Highbury was found investment that kind of saved it, or temporarily saved it from I think a company run by a guy called Kelvin McKenzie, who was the editor of The Sun. And so we had, I had the odd spectacle of Kelvin McKenzie coming into the office to reassure us all that we all still had jobs.
And I think six weeks later everyone got laid off. So that didn't work out too well. So I, I found my dream job and then immediately had it.
Well, what I thought was my dream job. I'm not sure I would have been truly happy writing about DVDs for too long. But I thought I could probably like leverage that into a position on Empire one day.
But, but, but, but it was, but it was over very, very quickly. And then the next step was imagine kind of rushed in, bought, bought what it wanted of Highbury's old portfolio, closed everything it didn't. And that included the magazine I had a job on and then let sacked every, like late, like effectively nobody had a job and everybody could reapply for the jobs that were left on the old magazines, even if they had previously worked on that magazine.
So, you know, someone who previously worked on Games TM, which is one of the ones that survived, would have to reapply for their old job. So, I don't know if, I mean, that seemed good to me because it meant I still had a fighting chance of getting a job. I'm not sure how I went down with the people who had worked for years on those magazines and all of a sudden had to compete with someone who effectively hadn't played very many games the last five years for their old role.
But I think a bunch of people also took redundancy and left, so that would have thinned the herd a little bit. And I remember not being quite sure what to do, but chatting with John Denton, one of my previous colleagues on Games TM, and I know you know him, Sam. And John Denton said, just apply for a job on Games TM.
Like, that is the magazine that suits you the best, and that's the magazine that you'll be able to bring the most to. Because he didn't work on DVD next with me, but we'd met and I think he knew where I was coming from. And yeah, so I reapplied and was one of the lucky people who got rehired and brought back into the company.
And that was it. And in a weird coincidence, the other person who started on Games TM at that time, this was an external hire, was Keza McDonald. So we both started on Games TM on the same day.
Only I was like 25 and Keza was like 16 or something like that. Outrageously young and talented. And I'd already spent at least a couple of years like circling the drain before I'd managed to get to that point.
But yeah, so I kind of got my... I mean, it's a long winter answer, but it's difficult to give a shorter version of it just because it was never really where I intended to end up. Like my hope was I could become a film journalist.
The magazines I wanted to write for would be Empire or Sight and Sound. And I wasn't really sure exactly what the cutting edge of gaming was anymore. What was the new stuff?
The last time I'd read a copy of Official Xbox, they were saying that Blink's The Time Sweeping Cat was the best game of the year. So as I now understand it, that wasn't the case. I wasn't to know at the time.
But yes, I ended up there by accident. But actually, when I look back on it, I was pretty lucky to have John Denton give me that advice at that point, because I'm not sure I would have stayed. And it turned out to be a really, really good place to be.
Yeah, I mean, I've always been fascinated by that period, because it all happened before I joined the the hybrid stuff. And it sounded so messy. And like you say, some people who were there didn't get to stay.
And it seemed unnecessarily brutal. And yeah, I was lucky in retrospect to have avoided all that. But there is something about the Kelvin McKenzie detail of that, that gives it a kind of like shit British media energy that just like really enhances it as an anecdote.
That's a great sort of light detail that really paints the picture.
So yeah, I mean, like when when Kelvin McKenzie is your white knight coming to come to save the day, then you are you are in trouble.
Yeah, so I was curious what you made of the Bournemouth Games magazine scene once you kind of got used to it. So I guess how did you acclimatize to Games TM? And what did you think of the other mags that were around at that time?
Well, I think it's reasonably hard to remember exactly, because this was all quite a long time ago. I think it was probably 2006, maybe, that a lot of this was happening. I remember feeling like that Imagine was the place where all of the runner-up magazines kind of were, right?
So you didn't have any of the official magazines, but you had the unofficial magazines. And I worked there, and we had some good magazines. In some ways, being unofficial is better than being official, because you got more freedom.
And I quickly learned that Games TM was very closely associated with Edge magazine, a magazine I was aware of, even when I wasn't playing very many games. And that we were, I don't know, I felt like it was almost set up to be Edge's competitor. But in being set up that way, it was kind of doomed to be forever in Edge's shadow, or be seen as Edge's kind of slightly less mature and intelligent little brother.
So I think there was a sense, I think, internally, of imagine being quite a scrappy underdog. And I think that's something that people who worked there felt too, that the future was this much bigger company, which was true. A better resourced company, which I don't know about whether you could comment on that, Matthew, but that's definitely how it felt to us.
And ultimately, slightly better paid than we were as well. So I think we kind of felt like we were, you know, sort of slightly behind in most places, but it was quite a small company overall as well. But I do remember thinking there was quite a lot of people who really understood what they were doing, who really knew what they were talking about.
And the other thing that was immediately impressed me about it was how much everybody, how enthusiastic everybody was. I think it was also a really good time to start in that world because it was the same year that the Xbox 360 launched, which was, you know, quite an exciting time in games overall. And I think also was the period I think I was covering games, consumer games, was quite an exciting just time for games from 2006 to 2010, 2011.
An awful lot of new things were pioneered. There was an awful lot of excitement around what games could be in a variety of different ways. And I think with Games TM, there was the opportunity to cover as much of that as possible because we weren't like we weren't we weren't just focusing on one format.
You know, we had the freedom to skip between console platforms to also cover the PC and the indie scene and flash games. And there were there were just a lot of things that were emerging at that time, which were quite interesting even to me at that point. I was that's kind of kind of where I gravitated more and more.
I think we liked being underdogs at Imagine. You know, I feel like we wore that with pride a little bit. Do you think that's a fair assessment?
Yeah, I think so. I mean, it's something that I can't remember ever explicitly talking about. But I do think against all of the odds, because Imagine wasn't the easiest place to work sometimes, I do feel there was a pretty good morale overall.
Like there was a certain amount of, yeah, like kind of being in it together, maybe, like being up against it, but still finding a way to enjoy it and to pull together when it mattered. And I do kind of feel like we felt we were on our own to a certain extent, like some support from the higher levels of the company. But, I mean, I don't know how it felt to you, Samuel, being on play, but GamesCM really felt like our magazine.
Like we were the ones that came up with all of the content. There was relatively little input from outside, apart from what went on the cover, and kind of a limited amount of oversight on most aspects of how it came together, together and how it was produced. And that's certainly how I remember it being.
And I know listening to this podcast and certainly the way you talk about going to Future, it does feel like Future just was a bit more of an organized and professional place overall in terms of like how many people you have, you know, giving you feedback on your actual work, you know, trying to improve you as a writer, which I don't think we ever got really, I imagine, publishing. You did really feel like this, your magazine was your little piece of the company. And so long as you got it done on time and on budget, then you were pretty much free to fill it however you wanted.
So long as the cover got signed off.
Yeah, that's the thing. The cover was the thing I think, you know, probably involved the most back and forth with management. But yeah, generally speaking, I don't think I ever heard anything about the content unless something, someone was upset or something had gone wrong.
So generally speaking, yeah, like you say, you were just left to it, which was a good thing. Yeah, you are right. When I got to Future, it was a bit of a shock to the system to have Tony Ellis say to me, all your sentences are too fucking long.
And like I said, everything you write is one run-on sentence after another and just understanding, oh, I actually wasn't actually a good writer, I imagine. I had potential, but I never really, there was never really time to iron that out or to get better at it. So beautiful looking mags, I imagine, but I agree there was a slight difference in terms of how the editorial was sort of managed on that side.
Yeah, well, that is one of the things that I regret about only having worked in magazines, I imagine, because I feel that as much as I had a decent facility with language is because I'd spent three years at university just writing, and that was pretty much all we did was write essays, write scripts and screenplays and, you know, theatre and different things like that. So I came in feeling like I had a good command of language and a decent vocabulary and stuff, but also I had no one kind of policing my tendency to be quite indulgent. And I don't think I ever really got as good at magazine craft as I probably should have done working on it for four or five years.
And I think it's because, well, we did have, you know, people who were, you know, nominally in charge of editorial. I just didn't really feel like a real guiding hand or that they felt like maybe they could step in and say, this is how you get better or this is how you improve. And potentially that's because, you know, the wages weren't great, I think turnover of staff was expected to some degree.
Imagine, I think not a lot of people lasted more than two years. You didn't really have people that were kind of long serving members of staff. And the whole thing just seemed a little bit, you know, brittle, I suppose.
And I think in that environment, it's hard to kind of work with people one to one and invest that kind of time and effort into improving them because I think there's an expectation that they may not be around for very long.
Yeah, that's that's probably true. I mean, my tolerance for it was very high because I had nowhere better to be. I didn't go to uni.
I joined when I was 18. And so, you know, I was I was in it for the long haul, basically, which is, yeah, which I think is is a double edged sword. You know, it just it means you'll put up with a lot.
But, you know, it did. It definitely sort of made me in a lot of ways. Gave me a lot of discipline.
And, you know, you'll never have to work as hard again as you did. I imagine, I think is also true, you know. So work ethic, it gives you.
Yeah, no, totally. And that's one of the things about GamesDM, particularly as it relates to Edge, that GamesDM was conceived, I think, as a competitor to Edge. But one of the one of its defining features against Edge was it was much longer.
So it was one hundred and eighty pages, which I think we had maybe thirty pages of of of adverts in there. But as time went on, that number would dwindle. And I remember there were some issues where we had twelve pages of adverts.
We had to fill one hundred and sixty eight pages of editorial every single month, which is an inhuman amount to do. And I did have like a decent amount of freelance budget. I don't know what Edge's was necessarily, but I think Edge was maybe one sixty, some somewhere around there.
So definitely like twenty fewer pages, probably slightly more money to spend on each page. A better pool of freelancers. It was always quite hard to get the best freelancers because I really did think that it was kind of seen as a choice between Games TM or Edge.
And if you're already working for Edge, why would you bother with us? So there was that, but to your point, Samuel, I mean, 180 pages every single month between a team of, I think we were editorial staff for. But yeah, I mean, I frequently would write 32 to 34 pages of editorial every single month, more than a page a day of finished publishable copy, which is huge.
I think the largest a team got while I was there was there was Rick editing it, there was John Denton, you, and Ashley Day was there. And I think around the time I joined, you had that guy, Adam, who left to join Harold. Yeah, he went to go work in, I think, for the police or something.
The police.
Yeah. And I think me and Dave Shaw at the time thought it would be hilarious to yell 5050 when he walked past our desks, because we've been watching The Wire. Very much a very mature, mature workplace we were talking about earlier, that maturity very much coming to the surface there.
But yeah.
Well, you know what? That is true. You would get people like, Adam came in as a staff writer, I guess.
Maybe he got a promotion to senior staff writer. But at some point, he obviously thought, fuck this, I'm going to go and work for the police. And that is very much a place where lots of people ended up.
But I did remember thinking at one point, watching people leave. Like if I actually just stick with this journalism thing, just like that the pool of experienced people will probably naturally whittle down until you kind of are going to be in line for one of the better jobs at some point. So there was a part of that that made me think like I'm decent at the job.
I've got ideas. And I think if I could just outlast people, then I could get to one of the publications that I admired a little bit more. You know, Edge being among them, but there were also websites at that time that I was really enjoying.
I think Eurogamer towards the end of the 20, towards the end of the 2000s was really solidifying itself as something quite special as well.
Yeah, I'd love to ask you about managing that feature section because it did seem like a beast. You say that you were quite self-indulgent, but you are right. You were, your writing was very refined and you did have a particular perspective on games.
And I actually thought you and Ash were a perfect kind of combo for Gamers TM because he had that incredibly deep knowledge. And you just had a perspective that I think the magazine also needed. So what was that process like of building that feature section each month?
I mean, it was a nightmare, to be honest. I remember just being in a constant state of panic about it because I think we needed, like it depends a lot, right? Like the cover could potentially ease pressure on the feature section.
So if you have a good cover, you could have maybe 8 to 10 pages of the feature section spoken for. But I mean, I don't know if this changed after I left Samuel, but my experience of the cover meetings was, like realistically, they either wanted to see Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed, or you might really have no idea what was on your cover until a week before print deadline, because there would just be a reluctance to commit to whatever the other option was. So and there were a few times where you just kind of have to magic up a feature based on very little because it was based on a game that was kind of perceived to be slightly more bankable than the others.
So I really felt like I had to be finding somewhere between three to five features every month, which is a lot when there's nothing prescribing those exactly. Like maybe one of those could be game focused, but very often they'd have to be themed in some way. They'd have to be an exploration of a certain tendency in game design, or some kind of, I don't know, theme or idea that you could look at in a different way.
I mean, I remember one feature we did called SpinCycle, which was looking at the relationship between PR and the games press, and some of the weird stuff, and some of the bad stuff that had happened, and how that was evolving now that the internet websites were on the rise. Things like that, like kind of more, I don't know, I guess you call them, I don't know, newspaper style features, something like that. I mean, I think ultimately I did move into kind of onto a site called GamesIndustry.biz, and I can see some evidence of my interest drifting in that direction there, but mostly it was because you kind of needed to.
Like, it's very, very difficult to find that many features. I had a pool of freelancers who would pitch. Sometimes they had access to people, sometimes they didn't, but so you would just have to take what was around and try and do your best to make it as good as possible.
I also, in addition to the feature section, I also had to manage the front end of the magazine as well. So that was another 18 pages or something like that. And again, like we, I think over time, we tried to move the magazine away from just, I mean, effectively going on Games Press two days before print deadline, rounding up all the press releases and rewriting them into news stories when we were pretty sure all of our readers had already read all of those stories on Eurogamer like in the preceding month.
And we kind of moved it away from that into almost like a mini feature based format where it would be kind of contributing to the discussion around those stories rather than just being reporting on the facts of the stories when by the time you came to be on the shelves, you could be six weeks after that event had happened. But definitely when I joined at first, there was a process of just using GamePress or looking indeed at GamesIndustry.biz just to kind of find content for the news section. So it was always a struggle.
I think Ashley maybe had less of a struggle because he could just reach into the recesses of his giant game stuff brain and pull out some new obscure game or developer to put in there. But I think Ashley and I both saw Games Editor as the slightly simpler job because that was much more a case of organization. Like on a multi-format magazine, you don't really have a problem filling up the preview and the review sections.
And it's just like what is coming out, what is available. This gets four pages, that gets two, that gets one, that gets six. And just handing out the code to people.
I mean, I know, Sam, you've done whatever, 12 page previews of Genji Days of the Blade and stuff like that. So I know that the single format life for a Games Editor is not nearly as cushy as it was on Games TM. But particularly as the years went on and you had things like Xbox Live Arcade and you had Steam allowing smaller PC games to find a storefront where they could be bought and kind of emerge.
We could really pick and choose. We were not covering relatively large console releases. We could review a mobile game if we wanted to.
I think that part of the magazine was probably one of the easier to manage, whereas mine was never less than quite difficult to put together. That's the thing. I don't think I've already had a defining strategy for the magazine apart from to try and keep it as fresh as possible because you were just so up against it in terms of the time available that you didn't really have time to plan anything.
If one feature slipped in the schedule, then it could cause a lot of problems.
Yeah, for sure. I did both Features Editor on Sci-Fi Now, imagine, and also the Games Editor of Xbox 360, of X 360 magazine. Sci-Fi Now is so much more involved than that.
Managing a feature section is much harder than managing a review section. I mean, one of my defining tasks in a given day, in a slow month at X 360, might be calling in the APR and saying, when's the Harry Potter and the prisoner of Prince of whatever code coming in, and then going, it's not coming out until launch because the game is clearly not very good. And that sort of thing.
Whereas in Sci-Fi Now, yeah, it was this grand juggling of, are things going to happen? Is this US freelance going to come through for me? And so yeah, I could see you were having a harder job than your typical reviews editor might have.
But I do think you're, I mean, as much prestige as you could really have in in Bournemouth at that time. I think you had one of the probably one of the most prestigious jobs in the definitely that games division. I was curious how much the edge element of it was a factor for you, how much you thought about it, because it was a strong era for Edge, I recall.
But I was wondering how much time was spent thinking about it, how much time you looked at it, or even just what your perception was of the two magazines side by side.
Well, I think in the early days, there was a very purposeful conversation around creating more distance between Games TM and Edge. I guess the way I saw it was that there wasn't really an equivalent as I saw it at Empire Magazine in games. I felt that Edge often was a bit more towards sight and sound than it was towards, I mean, I'm doing film magazine references here, but that's how I saw it at the time, like a slightly more academic at times.
But definitely could still be approachable, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it was sight and sound, but I was a big fan of Empire and felt that was a very approachable magazine, full of good humor and celebrated popular movies. It had Die Hard on the cover, it had Batman on the cover, it had a Tarantino movie on the cover. It was all very popular stuff, but I think in the 90s, popular stuff was also some of the better stuff out there, like David Fincher was emerging at that time and stuff like that.
That's the kind of stuff that Empire would really champion. But it was also still quite grown up and mature in tone, and I think it just walked an interesting line. But I felt that the Games TM could potentially move a little bit more in that direction.
Because I think you had Games Master and CVG, you had Edge above them in terms of tone. And I felt that Games TM was a little bit closer to Edge and actually could have brought itself down a little bit more. I remember talking about this with John Denton, actually around the time when we were reviewing Gears of War.
Because one of the things with Edge was the concept of the Edge 10, something that you guys have discussed quite a lot on this podcast. And at that time, I think it had only ever given out about four 10s or something, like very few. And I couldn't be sure I'd have to check, but I felt like it started giving them out with a bit more frequency.
After that point, like in 2010 or something, there's a few more 10s in that period than afterwards. But we were looking at Gears of War and we were certain it was nine out of 10. But we had talked a lot about, wouldn't it be nice if...
Because the Edge approach seemed to be almost trying to predict future influence, right? Like it didn't want to give a 10 to just the game that was just really, really good. But a game that would be really, really good in this kind of lasting and industry defining sense.
And while I think it made good choices in that sense, I think it also could tie itself in knots a little bit, trying to predict what that was. Didn't always get it right and then you ever can because scoring is kind of in and of itself, a fairly absurd and abstract thing to apply to your experience of a game. Like I'm not so many think subjectivity doesn't exist, but review is always a combination of your objective understanding of what makes a good game and your subjective taste in games.
So it is difficult to have this consistent 10 out of 10 standard. I specifically wanted GameCM to move to the Empire five-star review system, because I felt we could give out more 5 out of 5s than we could 10 out of 10s. And I think that would have changed the persona of the magazine, like a really fundamental way, because I think we would have had, you know, by doing that three or four 5 out of 5s a year, and you wouldn't need to kind of really like, throw everything behind this idea of a 10 being sacrosanct, because I think a 10 in that five in a five-star scale, sort of, in catchphrase, both nine and 10, you can inherently give out a few more of them, and that would make us a bit more approachable overall.
I think, you know, we also talked about getting rid of we, as the way we talked about ourselves in articles. We were reading a lot of online stuff, like the better online stuff, Eurogamer, and really kind of wanted to maybe experiment with the idea of introducing I, as the way that the articles were written. I'm not quite sure about that one, but we were basically talking a lot about what could we do to make ourselves a bit more distinct from Edge, and in doing so, you know, not, we always sold less than Edge, right?
We were, whenever we went on Roll Muck, or any of those forums we used to go on, when the new magazines came out, there would just be a lot of people making, you know, unkind comments about GamesTM versus Edge in terms of quality and so on. And we took some of that a little bit to heart, but I do think there was, yeah, as I said at the top, just a perception that GamesTM was just forever in Edge's shadow and was an Edge imitator and all of this stuff. And we talked a lot about how to change that.
We never got anywhere with any of it. It was not something, that kind of change, like redefining the persona of a magazine is not something that leadership had any real interest in, I don't think. It was, the way Imagine ran their magazines, I really felt was, don't rock the boat too much.
Play it safe with the covers. And if everything makes a little bit of money, when you put all the little bits of money together, you have a lot of money. That's kind of always how it felt to me.
So there was no real desire to push anything forward unless things were on the slide. And at least while I was on GamesTM, the sales didn't slide dramatically. We were always hovering around the same level with the odd spike on a good cover and the odd dip on a bad cover.
But we certainly never gained any ground on edge, which was always, I think, about a third higher than we were in terms of sales, as we understood it.
Yeah, yeah. That is an interesting position to be in. Mr. Castle, sounds like you're on trial for crimes there when I say that.
But I was curious if you remember GamesTM from being at future, if you had any perception of the edge versus GamesTM, match up there, because I feel like you're someone who, it's okay to admit that you were like maybe you didn't totally respect all of the Bournemouth lot's output of GamesMag at the time. These things were very territorial.
This is where Matthew says, we never spent a single second thinking about GamesTM.
Yeah. Don Draper, I never think about you at all.
No, I mean, it was weird, because obviously I was on NGamer for most of this, and when I was on NGamer, all I was ever really thinking about was, how do we get more people reading NGamer over official Nintendo? I mean, a magazine we really didn't think of was the unofficial Nintendo mag, I imagine, N Revolution. That is true of that mag, which may sound snobby, but it was the truth.
No, I think internally, there was still a sense of like, awe around Edge for people who didn't work on it, you know, including me. So I can understand sort of thinking about it a lot. I honestly think we were all just too focused on our individual mags and making them successful, because I think a lot of us saw them as the reason we were there, and our single life raft.
You know, if there wasn't an NGamer, I just wouldn't have an career doing that, was the perception. So I don't think you could spend too much time worrying about other people. The interesting thing about Imagine is for years it existed as just a lot of names that I knew, but I didn't really know anyone's work because I wasn't necessarily reading those magazines.
They didn't have as good an online platform for sharing that work. So you just never really read anything. You know, I don't think I've read much of like anything that either of you wrote while you were at Imagine, for example.
It's only subsequently when people have managed to stay in the industry long enough for our paths to cross in other ways that you are like, that was that name for years that I knew was also doing this thing. It turns out they're a brilliant thinker or, you know, a really sound dude or whatever. And it's kind of embarrassing, you know, looking back on it now.
I wish if I had that time over, we could have been a bit more open and had a bit more kind of communication between the two.
Oh, well, it's part of the fun as well, though, right?
Yeah, yes. But it's fun when you're like a snotty like, you know, young 20 year old. But now I'm like, oh, that was dumb because we were all in the same boat of these shrinking print magazines.
We were all going in the same direction. We were all basically fucked. So why waste time being snide about each other?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I quite agree. I mean, I think one of the reasons why we felt we had to think a bit more about our relationship to Edge was because in a very meaningful way, like I think if Edge wanted a game on its cover and we wanted the same game, we would never get it right, right.
Like there was there was definitely a because I think there was like a single format cover and a multi format cover. So you could you could lose our coverage you wanted to get directly because of that. And I think presenting ourselves as a bit of a different proposition or a more different proposition was one way we thought we could we can at least give give the people making those choices more of a decision to make.
But I agree I agree 100 percent. I don't think we thought about Edge as in like the people who worked there or you know who wrote here who's a good writer versus who isn't. It was it was mainly just as in how do we define ourselves against this magazine that from the very first day of Games TM has been positioned as the thing that we are like even by the people who created it.
So it was a bit of an odd position to be in. And actually website was another thing we really pushed for around that time like let's have a Games TM website. The name suits it.
It seems like the right time. But again no real desire to see the games media expand into the online space from the imagined leadership apart from in the form of the of Now Gamer the the website that everybody visited.
RIP to Now Gamer. By the way, Matthew Handrahan, did Gears of War get a 10 in the end in Games TM?
It did. Yeah, it did.
That was the right call. They were right.
Well, so this is the thing. I think at the time, like John and I discussed it, we decided because I think he was reviewing it for someone else and we both gave it 10 out of 10. I mean, the thing is, I think I was a little out of my element there because I hadn't played Resident Evil 4 at that time, which is obviously a key game in shaping that.
But it definitely got a lot of people's noses out of joint. I think part, because it was pretty short game. It was like six hours long.
Doesn't bother me. Final boss fight, not that good. Well, fine, but some of the preceding boss fights are absolutely brilliant.
But actually, if I look back now on all the games I gave a 10, it might be well, I gave like Bioshock a 10, that's more of a 10 than Gears of War is a 10. But it's definitely one of the most influential games of their era. And there is no two ways about that.
Like so many games looked and played exactly like Gears of War within like a year and a half of Gears of War came out. To the point where playing too many of those games became one of the reasons why I really quite fancy getting away from consumer games journalism because there was an awful lot of that games influence out there. And when you do look at how big third person cover shooting became over the next five years, I think it's difficult to say that Gears of War didn't have like a huge amount of influence on the games that followed.
That's on you for giving it a 10.
I think so, man. I think so, yeah.
Yeah, like I think it, you know, I've played Gears of War recently, the version they did about 10 years ago, and it's still better than all of those games. That's the thing. It is a cut above, technically, and all of the choices it made were original choices in that moment.
So yeah, easy to lose. I think at the time, maybe I heard that TM gave it a 10 and probably scoffed a little bit because like you say, I had recently played Resi 4 as well. And so it seems juvenile by comparison, but they are both tonally juvenile.
That's the thing, they're just juvenile in different ways. But they are both very, very accomplished games technically.
Yeah, it felt amazing to play. It felt like it really did feel very, very good to play. It brought something legitimately new to the online space since Halo launch, which not many other games had managed to do.
It became a bit of a mainstay there. So I think there were lots of ways that it sort of raised the bar in some senses, but also it was about a bunch of meatheads, and you wouldn't really want anybody to pay attention to the dialogue. And there was a load of ways it fell short, but I do think, or always thought, that every single thing about a game being perfect is not really and shouldn't be the criteria for a 10 out of 10.
Whether or not that is how Edge would look at it, I don't know. But I don't think any of the 10s I gave were because of perfection. They were from games doing something that shook things up a little bit or kind of raised the bar in a specific way.
You know, like Bioshock I gave a 10, as I said. Mass Effect 2, GTA 4. Yeah, just like games that really brought something.
Yeah, truly impressive was where my thinking always landed on that.
Yeah, I think those are all 10s that have stood the test of time as well, personally. I was curious, what were the other games that meant a lot to you at that time? What sort of shaped your sensibilities across those years?
As you were working on TM.
Yeah, I mean, I think Bioshock was a huge one. I hadn't really, the whole sort of meta commentary on player motivation and what game design is and how games all kind of take your options away and present you with what feels like choice but never really is. I just found to be, I found that a really stunning moment along with just like the beauty and the craft of rapture and just how well everything seems to be put together.
I mean, it probably is the defining game for me from that era. A game that if that hadn't come along, I'm not sure how long I would have stuck with games journalism. I think I just needed something like that to arrive and show me what was really possible in games as distinct from, you know, movies or books or the other places I was still looking to kind of get to find the art that I really enjoyed.
But Bioshock is so essentially a game, and it's not just a great place to explore in terms of how it looks or to play in terms of combat and the options there, but it also actually did something in terms of sending a message or telling a story that wouldn't be possible in another medium. I think that was a really important thing for me to understand at that time. And I think other games did similar things that made me think about it in a similar way.
Weirdly, a game I don't like to play too much, but that did impress me was Braid, that had an ending where it flips what you think the meaning of the game is on its head a little bit. It's not brilliantly executed in that way, but it was one of the pioneering games in the emerging indie space. So the combination of this new category of games made by individuals who could put something very personal out there and the way it too played with the conventions and tropes of video games to subvert what you think the message of the game is, I really appreciated that.
I remember someone called it pretentious to me, which I didn't... And the thing is, really, I didn't disagree with it. But I remember thinking, like, there's one thing I wish games were a little bit more often, it's pretentious, like reach for something and maybe don't quite get there, but at least be reaching well beyond territory that games have often trod before.
And coming from years and years of looking at art cinema and indie cinema and experimental movies and the kind of that I think back then games was a more narrow category than much more narrow category than it is now. And back then, I think it didn't compare favorably to something with such a long history of cinema in that respect. I actually think that has completely changed.
But in part, it's changed because of games like these, the ones that I mentioned now, kind of opening things up a little bit and meaning that we get the kind of the more classic experiences and they're as good as they've ever been and are innovating in different ways. But we also get like a broad range of games from smaller teams and individual creators that come from much more personal places and with a more of a more upfront sense of experimentation to them. I think that's been really important for making games the most interesting place to be from my perspective.
So there were those two. I was a bit of a Far Cry 2 bore as it happens.
Sorry about that.
No, it's fine, it's fine. Because it was another game where I actually was very frustrated to play it. I just was really into the thinking behind it.
And that was a big thing for me when I was covering games in the consumer space. I liked, I read Clint Hawking's blog, Clint Hawking was one of the creative directors on Far Cry 2. And he wrote a blog called Click Nothing.
I read everything he wrote on there. And he was big on if we need to move away from borrowing conventions and from other media like cinema presenting games in a way that follows those. You know, he talked about the Uncharted games a lot in that respect.
The whole idea of ludonarrative dissonance. We can thank Clint for that one. And the Far Cry 2 was kind of this idea that, and I don't know if you remember the game, but you really only have one objective in that game.
It has a whole opening sequence where you're escorted around this sort of African state by this guy in a jeep. You are shown all of the game's mechanics. And then at a certain point, it just says, there is a person out there called this, I think it's called the Jackal or something, find them and kill them.
And then you just go off and play the game. And it's you just sort of make your way through this space created by all these different rules. And I like to that as an idea.
So that I think my thinking was as much shaped from the editorial point of view as a gamer, because I think that I really was engaging with games mainly as from my position as a games journalist at that point. Maybe that's because I was managing the features section and always on the lookout for things that were getting my mind going rather than something I just wanted to sink an entire weekend into. But yeah, those are the games that came to mind.
But I think, you know, probably my whole, my favorite game from the whole of that period, that sort of 2005, 2010 or 11 was Mass Effect 2, but that's a kind of more of a bit of a down the middle video game than those other ones. And I think when I look back, those three games were the ones that got my imagination firing in a way that really helped me do my job better, I think.
Yeah, I mean, I think in some ways, that makes you perfect for the job you have now, because I could, at the time, you were much more discerning than I think everyone else in the office was. I think everyone else in the office would play whatever the big game was that weekend. And I think you would do the same thing, but you might play a game, and you might not be as impressed by it as other people.
I think you were pickier in a good way for all the reasons you outlined there. And it was important, I think, for TM to have that voice. It meant you were very different to John Denton or Ashley Day.
I think the three of you complement each other very, very well. So that makes complete sense to me.
Did you have that reputation in the office? Would people give you shit for not liking the thing they'd given a 10 to? Because there was a little bit of that with some of the edge guys, I remember.
People gave me shit for the games I gave 10s to. I mean, that definitely happened. I don't think I got quite as much like, review freelance as other people, because I don't think necessarily people wanted to give me Scarface, The World Is Yours or anything like that.
I only say that because I gave that game three out of ten for every game I've seen. But you know, stuff like that. I mean, I got freelance and you definitely needed to imagine to make ends meet, but I think I probably got as much sort of feature based stuff as anything.
I think there was, almost certainly, there was that perception of me. But the reality is like, when running the feature sections, just didn't really have as much time to play the games as others, like I think someone like John could probably play seven or eight games a month just for his job, you know. Whereas me, I might get one review a month, maybe two at most.
Maybe I do one for freelance. And freelance ate up a lot of my personal time as well. So there just wasn't really that much time to play games.
And when I think back to all the reviews I've done, there aren't that many, but I got some of the bigger games. You know, I got, like I say, there's some of the ones I mentioned, Mass Effect 2, Grand Theft Auto 4, Uncharted 2, Dead Space. Like I could, because I only got the one, I could generally pick the one I wanted to.
And I think a lot of people played a lot of games back then because they literally had to as previews or reviews. But that just wasn't my focus in terms of my journalism. So I didn't, don't quite have the experience of the all of the games.
Like, for example, when you're drafting on this show, I just don't think I would be able to keep up. I could be drawing from a much smaller pool of releases. But I definitely understood the industry and the medium in other ways, I guess.
Yeah, people mega respected you in that office. I think they, I think it was an asset in a lot of, maybe not for your freelance review prospects, like you say, but I think people, people knew you for it. You weren't going to be the guy who played Bayonetta necessarily, but you were the guy who would have great takes on how Bioshock 2 functions as a sequel, for example.
So, you know, curious if you actually liked working on Games TM ultimately, Matthew, you were really good at it. And I think we both enjoyed the Bournemouth social scene a lot. But I was I was curious how you felt about it looking back after you left.
I've said this before to people I've worked with since that I don't think I've ever been as happy at work as I was in Bournemouth, weirdly. There was a period of a couple of years right in the middle there where I kind of worked out how to do the features thing without panicking every single month. Where TM was doing pretty well, we were getting some half decent stuff on the cover.
There was a good settled group of people in the workplace. We could just go with it and it was just fun. It was just really fun to make a thing you could hold in your hands every month, something you could be proud of.
There was a real sense of camaraderie, like I liked the people that I worked with. Like you say, Sam, there was a really good social scene. I think I ultimately burnt out on it just because it was incredible hard work.
I don't know what it was like at future, but the freelance culture imagine was pretty necessary way to make ends meet. And we all did quite a lot of that and I did loads. So you would, I just felt like I was working all the time.
And I also felt that I just, I knew I didn't want to be the editor in chief of anything or the editor of anything I imagine. I saw what people went through in cover meetings and I thought that is not something I can handle. And actually I remember one issue of Edge had Miyamoto on the cover.
And it's almost like they'd styled it to look like the front cover of The NME or something, give it like a punk music kind of aesthetic, like treating him like effectively like a rock star. And just thinking like we would never, ever, ever, ever in a million years get that idea onto Games TM's cover because it just wouldn't, it just felt like you couldn't do anything that sort of creative or the assume that the audience would get it. And it was things like that, like that's the reason why we would want to edit a magazine is to have some sort of influence over it.
And I know Sam that you got up to that position while at Imagine, you also held that position at Future. I don't know if it changed for you, but it really felt like the editor role at Imagine was almost more restrictive in some ways because you would be writing less, you'd be playing fewer games and you'd just be spending an awful lot of your time trying to line up, you know, one of the small handful of games you really felt stood a chance of getting okayed at a cover meeting, but also being asked to come up with like three or four other options that you knew had no chance and just eating up your time. And I looked at that.
So I think in that way, I always felt it was a bit of an unsatisfactory place to work at the same time as really enjoying the social life and the other people around me.
Yeah, yeah, that's, you know, lots of interesting insight there. I think the cover meeting thing, I think I only ever had two bad cover meetings and the rest were absolutely fine. And I didn't ever really have like a massive, massive bust up with management or anything.
They were like mostly fine. And then it was, but I think it did condition my brain to be a slightly more conservative editor, because when I got to, got to future, and Graham Smith, who was editor of PC Gamer before me, who has just recently announced he's leaving Rock Paper Shotgun, very experienced editor. He had put, like our designer on the magazine at the time, John Strike, in a VR headset on the cover, and talked about, you know, this is the future.
And he put one of the little orange men from Prison Architect on another cover that was called The Indie Issue. And I felt like I was being so incredibly conservative by coming in and being like, here's my second Witcher 3 cover and stuff. And I felt like I'd carried a little bit of the imagine, you got to chase the three to four mega hot things going on, because you got to obsess over those sales charts mentality.
And I would say that it means that I don't have loads and loads of mega distinctive covers in my history of being an editor, because I think that stuff did get to my head a little bit. Yeah, weirdly, I think all of my dumb, bold ideas happened on this podcast instead of the medium of print, but that's a story for another time. Well, anyone who's listened to this podcast up until this point knows, really.
Yeah, but I miss the social scene a lot. In fact, I would say in some ways, I've always been chasing, trying to get that back in some way. Matthew, I don't know if this is relatable to you, but I feel like I'm always trying to find that sort of like new group of friends in a workplace, which is probably quite unhealthy.
But it's because, imagine it was my first job, I had that off the bat. And ever since then, it's like, well, I just want it to feel like that does again. But the truth is, it never does, because you're not in your 20s anymore, and circumstances are different.
But I have had like bits and pieces of it in recent years, and it's still something I think about. I don't know if that's quite a personal question to ask, I suppose, but do you ever have the same thing?
No, I do to a degree. I mean, like I definitely had a little bit of that when I moved to GamesIndustry.biz, like my team around me there, particularly the one in the UK, I still consider them friends now. I saw them at Develop, and we, yeah, went out a lot then, and yeah, there was a real camaraderie to that.
Once they left and that team changed, that changed a bit. I also wonder if it was a bit to do with the era, because when I thought about what was happening back then, you know, there was a lot of nights in the pub. For example, I'm not sure that really happens as much in workplaces anymore, certainly not in my experience.
The press trips also had that slightly boozier edge to them, a little bit more spendy on the publishers' parts, and that could lead to some really, really good times, that I think helped forge bonds with the people around you as well. And I wonder if there's a bit of a perfect storm of, as you say, Sam, being young, having lots of time on your hands, being kind of okay with living off not very much, having a pub that charged £1.30 a pint, whatever it was that Sixty Million Postcards did on Friday, like the Regulus Card price for the beer was actually even affordable on our wages. And just the era where that kind of, that finish work, go to the pub, hang out for the rest of the evening, do that three times a week, where that was just kind of more the way things were.
And Matthew, I don't know if that was the same when you were at Future, whether that just whole side of the culture has just shifted.
Yeah, I think it may still happen. It's just that we've not aged out of it, but there was a thing recently where Dan Dawkins was out, and Sam, you were there as well. I think Tim Clark was over.
We sort of found ourselves on a table with Tim and Dan and Joel Snape. But I could see in the same place, there were younger people who I know now work on GamesRadar, who are just keeping the fuck away, because they probably didn't want to sit with their boss, Dan, in the pub. And you're like, oh, I remember being at those tables and looking across at the publishers or the editors or Tony Mott with whoever Tony Mott was sitting with and thinking, who the fuck are those guys?
They're scary. We'd never sit with them. So maybe we've just become the scary people that the younger, cooler people don't want to go near.
Yeah, there's possibly an element of that. But yeah, it's really interesting to hear your insights on that, Matt, because I think about that time, I imagine, a lot. So I guess like more on the Games TM side, were there any interview experiences with developers or executives, publishers that you found particularly memorable or any features you were particularly proud of?
One of the ones that immediately stood out when you asked this question for preparation was, and I'm not sure if I'm going to wind Matthew up here, but one of the first big interviews I got was Mia Motay. And he was over in the UK to accept something like an honorary BAFTA or something, like some big kind of award. And they had a few interview slots available.
And I was the only person who could go. But I think this was within a year of me starting on GameCM. And even though I knew who he was, basically, I didn't really have an awful lot of understanding of him and his oeuvre to take with me.
So I had a very, and I had like less than 24 hours to prepare for it. So I had a very panicked experience of trying to cobble together what seemed like interesting enough questions to fill up the whatever it was I had with him a half an hour with him. Went up to London, interviewed him, thought I did a good job and then immediately realised that I just asked the same 12 questions that literally everybody asked me and I said, because those are the most immediately available facts.
So that was, that stands out to me as something that I, because my time away from games and no real, not enough contact with Nintendo overall, but I wasn't able to make good use of. But I think as time went on and I kind of really found my own focuses and passions as a journalist, I've done, I did interviews, I was really pleased, I interviewed a lot of fairly prominent game designers and all the ones I really, really wanted to talk to. Will Wright, Clint Hocking, Ken Levine, I did very long, you know, sort of 8 to 10 page profiles of all of them, like really digging into their histories and influences and kind of how they came to games and what they thought was their contribution there.
I also, one thing that I've forgotten that was a big part of what happened to Games TM when it was redesigned and we took a different approach to the front end. I started to interview a lot of the emerging indie designers around that time and ended up giving them similar room in the magazine to someone like, say, Peter Molyneux. So I think I was, I remember interviewing Derek Yu, who created Spelunky and more recently, UFO 66.
I forget the 50s. Yeah, right. I remember interviewing him.
He got three pages in the magazine. It had really, really nice use of his art. And we sent him a copy in the post and he was just completely overcome that anybody would spend so much time and give so much room to someone like him because Spelunky had come out probably within six months before that.
But we did the same for other people, Edmund Macmillan and Jamie Cheng from Clay. And I think I look back on those now and think, actually, that was a little ahead of the curve on how that stuff would be covered going forward. We gave a lot of attention to that stuff as well.
So, and I think like another piece that stood out to me was one of the few cover exclusives we got, I think, over-edged precisely because they gave Bioshock a 10, was an interview with Jordan Thomas for Bioshock 2, went out to 2K Marin and he's one of the smartest and most interesting people I think I ever interviewed. And having an hour, just sat with him talking about game design is a pretty good experience for someone who's so keen to learn more and understand and kind of have their head blown a bit by how deep the thinking can be around those subjects. I know you've talked to him as well, Sam, right?
He's actually one of the few devs I thought about asking to come on the podcast because he is such a great thinker, like you say, so articulate. And yeah, was it Fort Frolic he designed in Bioshock?
Fort Frolic, yeah, and the Shellbridge Cradle in one of the Thief games.
Deadly Shadows, right?
Yeah, Deadly Shadows. Yeah, that's right. That's right.
Yeah. And Maury.
So the best bit of two of the most classic games, you know, and then he formed a company called Magic Circle. Question, question. They did a game called the Magic Circle.
Yeah, that's right. That's right.
Yeah. And I think they got funding from Parker and Stone, the South Park creators, to make that. Yeah.
So, yeah, interesting, interesting journey that guy's had. And he also worked on Bioshock Infinite. I believe he got brought in by Ken Levine to help finish that game.
So definitely got some interesting stories to, to tell, I'm sure. Side note, I don't think I ever asked you what you thought of Bioshock Infinite. I know it's 12 years late, but obviously you were so into the first two.
What did you think of it?
I, I mean, I only played it that one time. And I remember really, really liking it, being certainly like incredibly impressed with the world that had been created for it. It'd be hard to comment on the specifics of the story and how that all went in the end.
But I remember really liking it, certainly not being disappointed by it. But then I really liked Bioshock 2 and I think Minerva's Den, which was the DLC for that, which was made by Steve Gaynor, who would go on to form Fullbright and make Gone Home. So I'm a bit of a Bioshock stan, I guess.
And I would definitely like to play another one of those games at some point in the future. I just like, well, I just like the idea of taking these kind of like these high minded ideas and finding a way to build an interactive video game world around them and tell a story within it with some of the best people who you could hire to carry that forward. I just found all of the games and all of the DLCs like really, really brilliant stuff.
I think that the indie interview thing you mentioned there as well, you're right. That is, it was a little bit ahead of the curve. I don't think I even realized that was going on.
I think the closest we probably got to doing that in play was covering things like the PSN games that were popping off at that time, like that game company and stuff like that. And we would only have covered those because there were no other PS3 games to cover. And because, you know, they are because they're PlayStation exclusives, they're therefore kind of more interesting.
But to identify those as they're happening in a kind of quite an early revived PC market is a super interesting thing to have achieved, I think, with the magazine.
Yeah, I could also have just been desperate to fill up space in the features section. It was a long time ago and I'll just give myself the credit, I think.
Well, as long as no one tells Derek Loo, that's fine. But I was curious, now we come to the, you know, the thing we ask everyone who's worked in print. What are your memories of press trips from this time?
Well, I've got a few. I mean, some of them. So a lot of press trips.
I went on a lot, and I think a lot of them, not much of consequence happens. Like, I think it's always lovely to fly to places that you would never in a million years be able to afford on your salary and have at least some of your meals taken care of. So that was great.
I mean, one of the earliest that really stands out. Publishers, when there were a lot of publishers, they used to do showcase events. So you get flown to, say, San Francisco or LA or somewhere else, but often cities in California or on the west coast of the US.
And the publishers, because back then they actually released quite a lot of games each year, would hire out a nightclub or some other space and put all of their games in that space. And they'd fly out journalists and you'd spend the evening with drinks and circulating and playing all of the games and potentially writing previews off the back of that. So I got signed up for a THQ, one of those, I think maybe Stuntman was in the mix then, I forget.
Maybe the first Saints Row game, I can't really recall. But then as it happened, Vivendi was, and that was in LA, and Vivendi was doing their one in San Francisco directly afterwards. So I think there was like a day in between.
And because I was already in California, the THQ and Vivendi got together, or the UKPRs for that, decided that they would find a way to transfer me from one to the other. And so this was slightly before these press trips got boiled down to their essentials. So you would very often have one free day when you went out then.
Like so with the THQ trip, we flew into LA. The next day we all went to Magic Mountain and that's all we did. And then the next day we went to Santa Monica and went shopping.
And then in the evening, we finally did a little bit of work. And then the next day I was put on a plane and flown up to San Francisco where Vivendi picked me up and we had a similar thing, free day. Then a day of work.
And then, Vivendi took us snowboarding for two days in a resort in Lake Tahoe. And I just couldn't, I mean, I, you know, this was like me, like less than two years into games journalism doing things that, I mean, my family had no money, right? Like I don't think I even left the country till I was sort of 16 or 17 or something like that.
So to be in this position where, where you would, where you were staying in these nice hotels, eating in good restaurants, free drinks, I think THQ had a party in a mansion up in the Hollywood Hills and you're kind of looking out all the lights and the cars and, yeah, just ridiculous, ridiculous stuff. And that, that stands out for me because I don't think it's ever, nothing ever lined up that well again, where it felt so much like a holiday, like everything else feels quite a lot like work. But there are other times where, like the lavishness of the trip is what makes it stand out.
There was one for Metro 2033, where they flew us all out to Moscow. This was, you know, quite a long time ago now. So not that, not that Russia's ever been, you know, the happiest place on earth or anything, but it's definitely not like visiting Moscow now.
But, you know, we went to the Kremlin and to Red Square and I don't know, our bus got attacked by a pack of wild dogs at one point, which is quite a memorable, a memorable encounter. But the event, but the press event for Metro took place in an actual nuclear bunker, like a kilometre below the surface of Moscow. So they took us all down there and they pumped all these huge cavernous tunnels with smoke and coloured lights.
And then they led us into this big chamber and we'd all play Metro 2033 and we got taken back up to the surface to interview the guy that wrote the books, Dmitry Glukhovsky and he was, he looked for all the world like a Russian gangster, but we were sat in this very twee restaurant that was crammed full of teddy bears. And I think Dave Shaw was on that trip with me. Dave Shaw used to work with Samuel on X360 magazine.
And just a really, really surreal experience, that one. But the kind of thing, I'm pretty sure that those sorts of trips still happen. It was quite a quick turnaround, but I think press trips were always good where they managed to line up the theme of the trip with the theme of the game really well.
And in that case, you know, going to Moscow for that is low-hanging fruit. I also remember on that trip that we nearly got in trouble for drinking vodka in Red Square. I think John Blythe was there, a former journalist for PC Zone, bought a bottle of vodka in a supermarket and wanted a picture of himself pouring the vodka into his mouth with St. Basil's.
I think it is the very ornate-looking cathedral on Red Square in the background. And while he was doing that and everyone was laughing, a police car sort of appeared very quickly out of nowhere, screeched to a halt. And we just had two very angry Russian policemen screaming at us for a little while, while we just said that we were idiots and we'd politely go back to the hotel, which we did.
So, I mean, but that's another part of it, right? Like, particularly back then, the tail end of the 2000s and particularly the early half of that, I think the press trips did have a bit more of an edge to them in that way. And like, definitely when I first died, there were a few of the few journalists still around who'd been the part of the previous generation and they definitely were a little bit more inclined to take the work less seriously, I think, and to see them more as opportunities to go to bars and things like that.
And so, they, that all calmed down a little bit, but not entirely in my time. Another trip I remember quite well was a Company of Heroes expansion pack put on by THQ. And somehow, I don't know how they got the budget for this.
We all went to a hotel near Biggin Hill in Kent, which is like a military air base. We got flown to Normandy on DC 30 Dakota transport planes, like actual World War II area transport planes. They had Spitfires sort of serenade us, like and do tricks all around the plane as we went over there.
And we spent a full day like trawling around like the Normandy cemeteries. And they got actual veterans from D-Day to give talks about what it was like. There was a guy from Nuts there who came along, presumably for the for the funny photo opportunities dressed as biggles with like a like a scarf that was kind of permanently kind of stuck blowing in the wind behind him.
And we went to the cemeteries with all of these graves. And he felt like, yeah, more than a little sheepish. We stayed in like genuinely the fanciest hotel I've ever seen in my life.
Like you couldn't go to the restaurant in this hotel without a jacket and tie on, which meant that obviously none of the penniless games journalists were able to eat in that hotel that night. Not even Biggles, no, not even Biggles. And they rented out a casino in the basement and a private bar.
We just had it all to ourselves. And both us and Relic were there till sort of four or five in the morning. And then the next day, just the state of most people, including the person I was interviewing, was rather sorry.
But that was kind of, that was quite late on. And I do remember thinking like, this is for an expansion pack of a game that didn't sell all that much. And just like, this cannot possibly be sustainable, like it's a practice.
And I think THQ went under about three years later. So I guess that's probably, probably the case.
Yeah.
But actually, sorry, just the last one, I guess that comes to mind was a trip to, and this one was extraordinary for me. This was a trip to Shanghai to see American McGee for Alice Madness Returns, right? So I think, I think they were really shopping around this exclusive, not something that nobody particularly wanted.
But I was well up for going to Shanghai basically, and keen to fill up six to eight pages of the feature section. So we didn't have to give it the cover, but I went there. And I went to the airport to meet the PR from EA, and the PR said, we don't have enough money to send both of us.
So she just handed me an envelope full of cash. There was like, this is like, this is your spending money. It was like 300 pounds a day that she gave me.
And I was in a hotel. And also because of the flights, they had to put me up in this hotel for an additional sort of three nights or something. So I had two or three clear days in Shanghai.
So I landed, went straight to Spicy Horse, which is where American, what American McGee's company was called, immediately did all of the work. And then just had an envelope full of cash and it was on my own in Shanghai for a long weekend. And there aren't that many of those.
And that kind of completely unsupervised trip is nothing like I'd ever, I'd ever experienced before. So it was great going to Shanghai and American McGee was, was a pretty good interview. But, but that, that I don't, either that, that hasn't really been repeated, I think overall.
That's a good selection of stories. I want to believe that THQ somehow bribed those dogs to attack your bus as well, to really enhance the, the sort of metro feel of that trip, or strapped sausages to the side of the bus or something. Or just, yeah, that's amazing.
Yeah, you're right, that would just be influence to spend now, wouldn't it? It'd be like sponsored streams, some gifting. We sent them a real World War II grenade or whatever, but they're going to do a 90-minute stream or something.
Yeah, I assume that something on that level does happen still, but I think it was so frequent back then, right? And even the most mid or unpromising games would get some kind of push on that level. I think it was a rare time.
You would definitely be going away for a trip four, five, six times a year, and I'm not sure that is the case these days.
Yeah, absolutely. I want to believe that you were like Indiana Jones, The Temple of Doom, with all your money at the very start of that, Matthew, just wandering around in the bars, you know.
I struggled to spend it. That's what I remember. She just said, try to keep your receipts.
And I did manage to keep all of the receipts. But that, I mean, particularly Shanghai back then, this was 2009, I guess. It wasn't quite what it is now.
It's definitely like a very cosmopolitan and modern city. But in terms of like how expensive it was, I remember it being an awful lot of money for someone with my taste, which was not expensive at all at the time, to run around with. But memorable nonetheless.
Absolutely. So I suppose my last question on Games TM is what led to you leaving? So I remember you going in 2010.
I remember it feeling like you were the first of quite a few of our little extended friendship group that, or co-workers who left at that time. And in retrospect, I think the recession started squeezing mags around that time as well. You know, like you say, TM was a pretty consistent seller, but I definitely remember the single format mags dropping, like around 10k sales at that time.
And there's team sizes started to shrink a little bit and, you know, websites. Like you mentioned, Eurogamer was a much bigger deal to PRs than, you know, a lot of the Imagine mags were. So what led to that?
And did you ever get any other offers to go elsewhere?
Yeah, well, I think all those forces did. I did get a job offer from Edge at one point, but this was before, maybe a year before that. But the reason why I didn't accept that was because it was for a staff writer position, maybe senior staff writer.
And I was a section editor. I was in a relationship with someone who lived in London. So moving to Bristol didn't really solve that problem necessarily.
Like I was on the National Express at sort of three o'clock in the morning every Monday to get back from from seeing her and Bristol would have just been the same exact problem. So I went for the job thinking I would take it if it if it was mine. But when in the moment I just felt like I might as well kind of hold out and try and find something in London instead.
So that was that. But in the end, I think it was because all the things you just said, Sam, the feeling of just needing to move on from the amount of work and pressure that it was, but also I think after five years of only ever writing names where you don't have a writing articles, where you don't have a byline, I had a keen sense that I wasn't particularly as known as I may ought to have been based on the standard of my work. I mean, the PR people would know me, other people at Imagine would know me, but you yourself said it, Matthew, you know, like, I don't know that I don't know that many people would have been reading or paying attention.
And when your name isn't even on your work, like, it's all the more pronounced. I was up for best writer of the GMAs a few times in that period. And I really felt like there was literally never a chance I could possibly win it against people who wrote for Eurogamer and actually had the ability to be more widely read.
And there was a point in time where I think a bunch of the PR people who had been working at publishers started to leave their roles and go into the GMAs in maybe it was 2010. And just having a feeling like I actually, but now that the people who gave me all of those exclusives and read the articles I wrote and have left their roles, like I'm kind of getting more anonymous, not less anonymous as time goes on. You are kind of relying on people who had a reason to come into contact with what you did to actually remember what it was like.
And I think it was that combination of all those things. And then just thinking, what if I'm gonna be writing about games for any more time? I think I want to go somewhere where my name will actually be on my work and I can raise my profile a bit.
This was also right after Twitter had launched. And I think the idea of having like an online persona or, you know, kind of building your own brand was starting to feel a bit more important as a journalist and it was hard to feel less exposed as an individual than you could feel or imagine, which was sort of tucked away anyway. But also, you know, we didn't have our names under what we were writing.
So I think it was a combination of those things, but also that feeling of just needing to be a bit more exposed as well. So I left and took six months to work out the next opportunity and that ended up being on GamesIndustry.biz.
Yeah, I mean, that's a really interesting transition, like a totally different company and style of working basically. I've done both now and I can see the difference. So, yeah, you spent a decade on GamesIndustry.biz.
So I have made you focus quite a lot on a much smaller period of your life, but it's the period in which our paths cross, which I guess is probably why. But I would love to hear about how working on GI compared to working on GamesTM.
Yeah, well, I think it makes sense to focus there because our paths crossed and also it's much more closely aligned with this podcast and its remit and focus as well. So that makes a lot of sense. And also in a lot of ways that defined my career too.
I think with GI, like, it's, it feels like a very different, I mean, it is a different thing, right? It's writing for people who work in the industry rather than people who play games. But everything about the way you, at least when I first started, the way you interact with the industry is quite different.
I mean, the first thing that's immediately different is you really aren't interacting with the sort of the PR layer around video game companies. Because you're not really writing about games anymore. They're not kind of...
With consumer press, you are always, you're always dealing with someone like a middle person, basically someone who organizes your coverage, who organizes code, who supervises you when you go on trips to places. With GamesIndustry.biz, because you're not really interacting with the products anymore. At least back then, I think this has changed a bit now, there's more corporate comms people around.
We were going much more to the source a lot more. We were going straight to the people at the top of companies or close to the top of companies. I became more connected more quickly with more influential people working on GamesIndustry.biz, in part because of the absence of PR as like a pervasive, not obstacle in the way, but just something that you had to go through to get the basics of what you needed.
But also because like the people who were reading the site were those same people, right? Like we were, we were like, I think GamesIndustry.biz was monetized on sort of reputation rather than clicks or copy sales, which kind of changes a bit the way you think about what you're writing and what your goals are or your focuses are, because it's not really about trying to appeal to the biggest number of people. It's actually trying to appeal in the right way to the right kind of people, which means that you need to define what your values are and try and stick as closely to them as possible.
So it's definitely got a lot more meat and potatoes side to what you're doing. You do have to cover things like financial reports and that kind of thing. But at the same time, you're also a little bit more free to write more broadly about the industry, what powers it, what developers need, what influences the kinds of games that get made, while never actually really writing about the games themselves apart from if there's some new game that changes things or that has the capacity to invent a new category, for example.
So we would definitely talk to someone like, I don't know, Notch about Minecraft when it first came out. But we wouldn't necessarily be talking about Army of Two the 40th Day, which is one of the last games I reviewed for Games TM. Another moment where I was like, maybe I've done enough of this and time to go and try something else.
But really, you know what, I just think it really suited me because of the way I thought about games and the part of it that made me most interested in, which was the fact that games were this sort of developing and evolving medium that was still working itself out. And that happened on the industry level as well. You had all these different parts of the industry that weren't there before.
Mobile games, for example, the indie space was growing. Steam was becoming more and more solidified as a platform. You had things like Kickstarter emerge.
And it really felt like, particularly for the first sort of four or five years on games industry, that there was always something new and disruptive coming along that really allowed us to kind of dig into it and to talk to people about the new directions things were heading. I think separate to that also, that you were, I mean, I traveled a lot, but it was not in the same way. The travelling I did was probably more similar to that Shanghai trip, not in being handed an envelope full of cash and put on a plane, but definitely like not being supervised, right?
Like I would go to places under my own steam. It would be to attend an event or to visit a company. And at Gamer Network, which is the company that ran that, that's the company that runs or ran at least Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun.
So definitely a company that had a decent amount of success. They were quite good with things like expenses. So I was able to go to places, spend time there, organize my own schedule, decide who I wanted to talk to, build stories in a more active way.
And I really enjoyed that. And I ended up going to some pretty extraordinary places that I don't think I ever would have seen without moving into that kind of journalism. Like I went to India a lot of times, Malaysia, Australia, the Lebanon, like just on and on list of places where, you know, games are made absolutely everywhere in the world.
But I think when we talk about video games, most of the time we're just thinking of North America, Europe and Japan. And it's just much bigger than that. And everyone in, there are people in every country in the world that have aspirations to make games.
And a lot of them feel like they're just part of something completely different. And I actually really enjoyed connecting with that and exploring it and covering it. And I ultimately made things like emerging markets part of my beat, I guess.
And that's another part of, I think, GamesIndustry.biz, which I really enjoyed. It was less sort of prescriptive. You could locate the thing that interested you.
And as long as it was genuinely moving things forward in the industry, that you could make that something that you focused on. So, yeah, it was, I wouldn't have stuck with it as long as I did, if I wasn't finding things to genuinely intrigue me in it. Possibly 10 years, a little bit too long.
But I think, yeah, you know how it goes, right? Like you finally decide enough is enough as a journalist and realize it's not quite as simple to get away from it as you would like. But I don't regret any of those years, certainly.
And by the last few years of GamesIndustry.biz, I did finally get to be an editor-in-chief of something and had quite a successful time there. But definitely by the time I got to that rank, I'd already started to grow, to fall out of love, I think, with the press overall, just having done it for too long, I think, having seen everything too many times. There's a cyclical nature to the industry where you just kind of see things coming round again and again and again.
And I guess it's the same also with reviewing games and so on. Like the same ideas seem to come back around all the time. And I think once you've seen a few of those cycles, it does tend to make you feel quite old, at least it did me.
Yeah, I think part of it is feeling like yourself that you've got nothing more to add to the profession. Like you say everything you get to say and then there is no more. That's definitely part of it.
Something else that happened, I think, at the time we were working on GI is that the regular games media has muscled in on traditional B2B turf. They talk about layoffs, they talk about AI, they don't write about fucking dev diaries and all the assets that people put out. They write about the same stuff that GI would historically write about.
I was wondering what you can have made of that as it was happening around you while you're on GI.
In terms of why the trend moved in that way, why you'd have, say, Polygon covering an EA investor call, that is not something that happened in the first half of the time I was in GI and definitely became more prevalent in the second half and obviously not just Polygon. I think it was because a certain maturation of the tone of the games press, understanding a bit, well, so a couple of things. I think that the indie boom made developers, humanized developers a bit more.
There were more people who were out there talking as people, like they weren't behind the mask of a giant publisher. There were people making smaller games, talking about their experiences working for larger companies, how difficult it could be, things like crunch, not seeing their families, discrimination, like these stories were just a bit more prevalent because people were able to speak a bit more freely about their experiences as developers. So I think over time that accrues.
And I think also as the games press itself diversified a bit, you got more people with different perspectives in, who cared about different kinds of things. I think the combination of those two forces may have led the press to a point where it started to find things like stories about crunch and toxic work cultures and as you say layoffs a little bit more relevant to what they thought their readers wanted to know and to understand. That's kind of a theory but the reality is it definitely did go in that direction and I think particularly by the time we finished on GamesIndustry, I finished on GamesIndustry, we were talking a lot about how to deal with the fact that Eurogamer, Polygon, Kotaku, IGN, I mean IGN has moved hugely towards investigative news reporting including hiring someone from my team, Rebecca Valentine, to help spearhead their efforts to do that.
It's something that's now become a reliable way for websites to get traffic. I don't know if that's still the case, I mean it's going back five years now but definitely news and good news reporting seem to become like as much of a cornerstone of the consumer press as reviews had once been and no longer seem to be. So yeah, it's an interesting thing but I ultimately take it to be a good thing because I feel like it just means that people who are really engaged with games are also really engaged with the way those games are made, the people who make them, the idea that those games should be made in the right ways and with fairness towards staff and obviously there's counterpoints to that, things like Gamergate and all of those more toxic movements but there's definitely some evidence that the audience has kind of grown up alongside the medium and is a bit more diverse and open and interested in more than just which game is 8 out of 10, which game is 9 out of 10 and what the next iteration of the series is going to be like.
Though obviously they're still interested in those things too, I think it's just you've got an engaged audience that is a bit more engaged with games than they used to be.
Yeah, I think that's very true and like I say, it's mostly a good thing because people are not just engaging with games on that superficial marketing level, which I think makes sense. I mean, I'd love to ask a bit about your work at PlayStation. What did that look like?
Well, the work at PlayStation was quite specific and quite focused. It was in the third-party game content analyst in their third-party portfolio teams. So that's the team that signs games like Stray, like Kena, Bridge of Spirits, like Sifu, the games that are not made by first-party or second or published by the second-party team.
But PlayStation has the ability to offer different kinds of partnerships to other games. They can include funding, it can be marketing-based partnerships, it can be inclusion and state of play. It's quite a big machine, really, overall.
And my role was to be kind of at the bottom of that machine in some ways, not bottom in terms of rank, but the games filter through. My team would play the best of those, or the ones that have been recommended by a layer of people at PlayStation called account managers who sort of liaise with publishers and developers of different kinds, and see what's coming in and then make recommendations of which games might seem to have to look at. You'd play it, you'd write up quite a detailed report about that game, might be quite a quick demo, it might be basically the beta version of a game, depending, and then make a recommendation of where it could fit within what PlayStation could offer.
Now, that role was almost 100% content-based, so it really was just playing games for a living. Oh, it's a dream. Actually, for the first time in many ways, yeah.
Just play these games, say whether they're good in various complex ways, and then make a recommendation of whether we should give it a deal, and maybe what kind of deal it was. So I did that for about 18 months in the end. I was very happy doing it.
It was a really nice job. It was during COVID, pretty much the entire thing. I think the lockdowns only stopped towards the last couple of months, so I was largely working from home.
But in terms of a job to exit journalism on, I don't think it could have been a better one. It took me a year to find the job that I was willing to leave journalism for, and that was the one that finally came my way after an awful lot of searching. So I definitely bided my time and made sure it was the right thing.
But the ability to go to a company like PlayStation, and to immediately go on to the publishing side of things, but in a role that means you're contributing to what's considered good versus what's not considered good, was really foundational for what I've been able to lead on to since. So it was a good job on a good team, basically, and yeah, it's interesting work.
Can you say any of the things you played in that, or is it all top secret?
I don't know, to be honest. There would definitely be some.
Anything you came across your desk is since become big on PlayStation.
Well, so this was the interesting thing, because the timelines for making games is so long, and I was only there for 18 months, I didn't ever get to see a game I'd recommended for partnership actually come out.
Oh, wow.
The other thing is, because PlayStation is so big, you would make a recommendation, and then the recommendation had a journey from that point. It wasn't 100% clear about. So you wouldn't always know if the games you'd recommended for partnership actually got partnership or didn't, potentially until they were even released or not released.
So I think when a time came where, like Kepler approached me, Kepler Interactive, my current employer approached me about coming to work for them. And I was not really looking for anything at that time, but when I had to make the decision, because I was in a position where I did have to make a decision about whether to put myself forward for that. I think that sense of being a little bit separate from the actual decision making that happened around what got signed, like I can make a recommendation, I could argue the case, but I wasn't always sure whether that was really crucial in whether something got signed or not, because I think most of the conversations that happened after that were a bit more business focused, a bit more marketing focused, a bit more sales prediction focused, and I didn't have much input into those processes or visibility on what happened during those.
So it was a really good thing to be paid to do for a living, for sure, and I really enjoyed working on my team, and I think I would have been happy to continue to do the job from there. But in the end, you don't have a real one-to-one sense of the import of things you're saying. So that means it's very, very difficult for me to say whether or not the things I said led to games getting signed.
Yeah, I'd have to think about it. And actually, the game that, I'll say this, the game that I looked at that I really, really wanted to have signed, but ultimately got signed by someone else was ****. That was the absolute thing that came across.
But it wasn't like anything from the game. It was actually, I won't say exactly what it was, but it was something that was a much more abstract way of demonstrating what the ideas were. And I was immediately taken by it, and I was like, okay, this could be something the likes of which hasn't been seen anywhere before.
And like we should really be behind this. But the thing is from there, we probably did want to sign it. It's just you don't really know what happens from that point on.
We might have had those conversations. We might have made an offer. It's just those are the things that you don't really understand.
And actually PlayStation is kind of set up like that. You don't know what first part is doing. You don't know what second part is doing.
They don't know what you're doing. And that's by design. And that for the most part, there's good reasons for that.
And ultimately, I don't know if my level of expertise with all of the other factors that go into what gets signed were really as relevant as the people who literally specialize in those things. We were the game content team and that's kind of the way the PlayStation like to separate things out. But I'm also kind of just unsure whether I'm NDA.
I definitely did see their game. I'm sure plenty of other companies did too. And it ultimately ended up elsewhere.
So I'm sure it's not too much of a problem that it's fine.
I've decided it's fine.
Yeah, exactly. You can represent me in court if you like.
If you want, I can beep out the name of the game. And so you're completely covered then because you've told no real anecdote of substance. Something for you to consider.
But there were times also where it was like you were asked to play, you know, say the next game in an incredibly popular series that everybody was waiting for. And you had to write a very long report on why it's a good idea that we signed a partnership with this game. And at times it was also like, I think we can just say, yes, you should partner with this incredibly successful and inevitably good game.
So there was a part of it as well. We weren't really championing small stuff. You were just telling people what they should already be aware of.
Or like, it's not, you know, it's a bit of a no-brainer for a platform to want to have one of the biggest games in the world, you know, on the platform. So there was also that side to it as well.
So I'd love to ask about your work at Kepler Interactive, which I understand to be a sort of a mix of Game Scout. I mean, you mentioned this on the panel that we posted last week at DEVELOP that you might sign two games a year, but you see, you know, hundreds of demos and meet loads of developers. But I think there's also a game experience sort of aspect to your work as well.
So what is it exactly that, you know, being portfolio director at Kepler means?
Well, I was hired as portfolio, senior portfolio manager. My role is broadly quite similar. I just have a little bit more influence in all of the areas that comprise what I do.
So it's again, content focused overall. The goal of it really is to be probably the main person that really thinks about the things that could make Kepler distinctive in terms of the games it signs, trying to come up with some consistency across what those games should be, what they should do. And that is kind of an abstract thinking process in some ways because we're not focusing on genre or anything like that.
I think we're focused much more on creativity and games that are approaching either new ideas or kind of established ideas in new ways and have reached beyond kind of typical points of influence that you see a lot in video games. So my role is about trying to keep us on track on that side and also being quite an influential figure in terms of scouting for games, how we look at pitches and which pitches go through. One of the people that makes the decisions or one of the more influential people on deciding what we eventually sign.
And also once we do sign a game, I lead the process around giving developers feedback as they make the games around key milestones as well. So it's, there are other people that contribute to every single part of that, but I'm probably the only one that works across all of those facets with a specific focus on content. So when I say content, horrible word, but games.
You know how good the games are really. And I think part of why I've been able to kind of move up a little bit there is because I do have, I was able to come to the table with something a little bit concrete, albeit relatively sort of high brow about how we could think about games that would allow us to sign things that could potentially stand out a bit more in a very, very crowded space where I think anything that huge, too close to kind of the tropes that a lot of games use can easily not find an audience. It's something we're still developing as we go and working on.
And I think every game we release is going to move us a bit closer to understanding what that is. But I think this idea of, I don't know, my not necessarily having had an unbroken chain of just games being my sole focus or my number one source of entertainment or my favorite art form or whatever, it's allowed me to kind of come in and bring some of that perspective as well. And there are other companies, people in the company that are the same, the CEO is the same.
We talk a lot around those ideas. But of course, we all play games and we all love the medium at the same time. It's just trying to bring a slightly different way of looking at it so that we can carve out a space in what is very crowded field and increasingly crowded field really.
Yeah, I mean, I thought, you know, it's an interview that ran on GI that said, you know, with your CEO that said, there is a very familiar pool of influences that's been used too far too much by the industry. We privilege games that avoid leaning into those tropes. Culture like Star Wars, Blade Runner, zombie movies, Greek mythology, superhero comics to list a few examples, have an outsize impact on how a lot of games look and feel.
And we're trying to look beyond those as much as possible. And that is a good philosophy. People are more and more aware of who Kepler are and what they do.
So an interesting place to be for sure. And I guess on that note, we should ask you about Clair Obscur, Expedition 33, a genuine phenomenon that's happened in games this year that you are a part of. It's been great seeing you and the devs get to do a victory lap with that game.
So I guess we'll ask. I mean, you've probably told this story a thousand times now, but what led to signing that game? And when did the magic of what it is start to coalesce to you?
Well, I mean, that game was actually signed just before I joined Kepler. So a few months before I joined. So I can maybe parrot what I understand about it, which is to say that I think that the team just was able to demonstrate some of what you're seeing in the Finnish game, specifically the world, right?
The amazing character, their amazing facility for character design, an idea for a battle system that seemed to reflect the traditions of the genre, while also introducing something quite fresh into the mix as well. And the promise of all that coming together with people who clearly knew what they were doing were able to very clearly articulate their passion for what they were making. I think that that is a powerful mix that I would say is more rare than you would imagine when you see as many games as we do.
I mean, to that point about that list of influences that you see a lot, I mean, it doesn't get you down. You know, you don't get down from 1,500 pitches to one using that list, but you get from 1,500 to maybe 100, something like that, right? So it gets you down to a group of games.
And then from there, some of it's just going to be about gut instincts, and I will say this about the people that founded my company. They've been doing this stuff for a long, long time. My CEO was at Xbox for many years.
He's worked NetEase, other places. He's got a really great instinct for... And this is the thing, it's not a scientific thing, I don't think, with him.
And I think in general, the people who are best at picking games kind of do it more from experience and their gut, because I think games that sell tend to be... The games that really stand out, like that really, really get people excited, tend to be exciting in and of themselves. And I think it's like a muscle.
I think the more you exercise it, the better you get at doing that. And if you're bringing to that an interesting perspective yourself, I think you can end up picking up games or making a more persuasive case to a developer that has a game of that kind to come with you, because you understand it in a way that other people don't. I never saw the prototype for Expedition 33 that got signed, but I know...
I saw versions of the game very shortly after that, and a lot of the magic of that game is right in there from the start. We've... I played the first area of that game for a long time, many, many hours in the very first area of that game.
But like even from the first enemy encounter, you know, from the first few enemy encounters in... Oh, God, is it... I'm going to forget the name of the area, but you can say...
You can see that they are... That they've got a visual sensibility which is quite different from anything else, that the French cultural aspect of the world they created was going to be something really special. You know, the twisted Eiffel Tower and their vision of, well, what is effectively Paris.
I mean, these are very striking images and all of that was in there from the very earliest builds I ever played of that game and they kind of built it up from there and just never really wavered in their standards. And I think that's the other thing that makes it an exceptional game is that a lot of developers really struggle to maintain momentum and to keep up that level of creativity. And they managed to do that, coming up with consistently fresh visual designs.
They had a clear view of what the gameplay design was going to be, how the combat was going to work. And they just managed to make smart additions to it as they went the whole time. And then maybe a few good pieces of luck along the way.
I think the way they found their composer, you know, I think just on SoundCloud, I mean, there's an element of luck to that and it couldn't have gone better. So I think a few things come together in that way. But I think that the signing is probably not the biggest achievement of that because at that point there's promise, but that's really all there is.
And games can go in multiple directions from there. And they just happen to be a team with the dedication and the focus to keep going in the right direction and working together to realize the goal. And I've seen enough games in development now to know that that's actually pretty difficult to do.
And it takes a lot of things going right for you, that you don't always have 100% control of. So we've talked about it at work, like we could work for another 10 years and maybe never get anything quite as brilliant as Expedition 33 again. Though we're going to definitely try to make sure that we replicate as much as we can of what happened.
Yeah, I can't wait to see what else you folks work on. And yeah, what Soundfall works on as well. It's been a genuinely fascinating phenomenon to see pop off in the way it has.
And seeing people in the kind of like the French outfits from the game at DEVELOP last week was even kind of surreal.
Yeah, people were trolling around with begets and berets on and stuff like that. What have we created, you know?
Just I guess as we were talking about it earlier in the episode, what was it like when you saw the Edge 10 for it?
Well, I've got to say that the moment where the review scores started to land, I wasn't aware of it, but I was walking around the office looking at my phone at the Metacritic average and scrolling through all the different scores with the biggest, stupidest grid on my face imaginable, and everybody in the office just started laughing at me because of how giddy I apparently was with how well it had all gone. So yeah, it's difficult to describe. I think it's probably the best day I've ever had at work, was the day that we finally saw the review scores, because honestly, I think I'd probably put something like 80 hours into Expedition 33 before it launched.
And like you kind of lose perspective on what's gone right and what's gone wrong, or what could potentially go wrong. And I certainly think you don't ever imagine that very, very little could be picked apart by people, when it's kind of been one of your roles is to try and look at everything from every single angle. But yes, to kind of still, I think even after, even after so many great games have been released, to still be the highest rated game of the year is quite something.
And to see something like an Edge 10, it was, yeah. I've worked at Kepler for basically three years now, and it really felt like the culmination of everything that had happened prior to that, was that bad day in that moment. And like I say, we may never get another day like it again, but we've just got to hope that by trying to emulate as much of what we did, we get to experience something like that again.
I haven't experienced that on a few more occasions yet, and I definitely hope that I do.
Ah, so great. It really just feels like, in the narrative of the year, it's like the anointed one. You know, regardless of what happens with other game scores this year, just the story of where it came from, how big it was, it feels like it has that momentum behind it.
I think that kind of slight underdog narrative is probably going to stand in good stead, even as it comes up against Death Stranding 2 or these other games which are legitimately great. But I think it's that additional slant that that story has is going to be pretty difficult ones to topple when it comes time for, you know, awards and all the different things that still lie ahead for a game like that. And yeah, it will be deserved in any case.
And I do hope that the Sample team gets to experience that as well, because they definitely worked extremely hard for a long, long time. And it will all be richly, richly deserved should it come their way.
Yeah, I mean, I know that, you know, seeing those review scores was probably, you know, probably does top the experience of going to postcards with a Regulus card and getting a Fruli. But, you know, like it's certainly, I imagine, a comparable experience to that.
Yeah, like having a cup of soup every day for lunch to save money. Yes, slightly, slightly better than that.
Yeah, getting a Chinese chicken baguette from Appetites. And yeah, with your £50, £360 review of some bullshit. Yeah.
Okay, well, that's awesome, Matt. It's been great to be able to, you know, ask you about the course of your career, to dig into the print stuff in real detail. So thank you for taking the time.
Where can people get you on social media?
They can't really. I mean, one thing that I never really ever got to grips with was social media. I am at Matt Handrahan on Twitter and I think I'm the same on Blue Sky, but I think it's in my Twitter bio, you know, thoughts of my own, but I never post them here anyway.
So that is that's kind of me on social. Like I might do one tweet a year or something like that. I'll retweet a few things, but there's not really a great deal of value in following me.
I'm afraid it's the way I've always been. And actually, to be honest, like while it probably hurt my journalistic career for a while, I think it's kind of come around the other side. And now most people would kind of rather not be on Twitter or could extricate or like social media could extricate themselves from it.
So this feels like the worst possible time to all of a sudden start tweeting and whatever they call it on blue sky a lot. So I think I'll probably probably stick with that. But I'm there if you really want to reach out.
Fortunately, you don't have to be out there posting on LinkedIn about Expedition 33, Matthew, because plenty of people who never worked on it have already done that. So they've saved you a job there.
Trying to guess the budget. Yeah, they'll never do it and we'll never tell them. So there you go.
OK, well, that's great. And thank you so much for coming on again. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
Oh, me? I'm sorry. Yes.
Sorry, Mr. Castle, please.
Thank you. Mr. Basil Bestow on blue sky and Letterboxd.
Yeah, I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both of those. And the podcast is at BackpagePod, patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us.
And yeah, thank you again, Matthew, for your time. Matthew Handrahan, that is.
Yeah, not me. I did fuck up.
And also you, Mr. Castle. And yeah, we'll be back next week. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
