Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. We have another special guest this week. It's Jon Denton, a YouTuber best known for listening to and reacting to the best music in the world.
That's his description, but I think it's true, judging by what he has covered on his channel. This is going great so far. In a previous life, he was a games journalist at Imagine Publishing in Bournemouth.
We worked together for several years there. He was also the co-host of Chet and John's reassuringly finite gaming playlist, which was a key inspiration for this podcast. John Denton, it's a delight to have you on Hayden.
I'm very well and very happy to be here as well.
Yeah. It's a delight to have you. I'm sort of, that's it now.
My pillars of Imagine are all done after you and Handerhan. It's like the last big guest for me to have on from that period.
I was wondering why I was the last one, but we're here now.
Well, I think we're worried that once we've handled the guests on, the podcast is over.
Oh, so I'm the final guest?
Yeah, this is the final episode. Welcome. Hopefully, it's now a great honor rather than an insult.
Great to have you on, Jon. Like I say, your podcast is a massive reason I wanted to make this podcast. We'll talk about that in this episode.
We'll talk about you working in games media and also what you do now. You've had an incredibly impressive career. I did want to kick off at the start and ask, what games do you play growing up?
What was your relationship with games growing up?
Oh man, I haven't spoken about this for ages. I'm old enough that I was there from the start. My first memory of any game was actually Space Invaders being played on a friend's, I think friend's dad's, I'm going to say computer, I have no idea.
It was loaded on an actual floppy disk, not the plastic one with the metal slidey bit, the actual five and a half inch floppy disk with a little handle that goes over the disk drive. I'm pretty sure it was my first gaming memory of God knows what age. And then I was just obsessed with that point, but I never had anything myself at my house until I think my eighth birthday, and I got an Amiga, so that was like 1990.
So I just had this early part of my childhood going around to friend's houses, sitting there for, I don't know, an hour waiting for a tape to load on a Commodore 64, and it didn't work. But just this obsession that was just so sparing. So they were like these mystical things to me that I was just absolutely loved, and I only got to interact with maybe one or two hours a month when I went to someone's house to play.
And then finally got the Amiga, like I said, 1990, the Screen Gems pack, Shadow of the Beast 2, Nightcrawler? Nightbreed. Nightbreed on the Amiga absolutely scared the shit out of me when I was eight years old.
So there's a bit where you get chased by this guy with a pink face. So there was all of that. And then, yeah, I just grew up with it all.
So Super Nintendo and Game Boy after that. And then just moving through into my teenage years. PS1, about 14 years old, I think I was.
And that changed everything for me. That was the moment where everything started to feel serious in terms of the games, the way games were changing, but also in terms of my relationship with them, where I started to read Edge like so many of us did, and started to really get into it in a completely different way, rather than just playing it. And it was also the age where pretty much everyone else in my school, which is funny to think of now, when you think of how kids are, my son is actually 14 now thinking about it, which is just, fuck, I just feel like.
But I was pretty much the only one who was still gaming at 14 in my school. Like all the other boys are just like stopped. It was just for kids or whatever.
So I actually got bullied for gaming when I was 14 years old, which is mad to think now. Yeah, and then the relationship has just gone through with every generation all the way to now. I haven't said any, you actually asked which games I played.
I haven't said any games apart from Space Invaders, have I? Not a single one.
No, but the formats were ticked off one by one. It was useful. Nightbreed you mentioned and Shadow of the Beast 2.
That is it.
I take it back. I did say some games.
So what were your key SNES games and PS1 games?
SNES, Super Mario World is probably the answer that I would give if somebody was to ask me my favorite game of all time. So that's an easy one. I think that is the answer that I gave in my interviews for becoming a games journalist, which I guess we'll talk about later.
So, yeah, key SNES games, that one, Rock and Roll Racing. Definitely. Playing Bad to the Bone.
That was a soundtrack on that one, if I remember correctly. Man, I used to play a lot of Street Fighter. I would say that's probably my most seminal game series.
It's influenced so much of my life. It's kind of the reason I've done everything, really. It was seeing Street Fighter 2 for the first time in a leisure center.
I grew up in Guernsey, right? So I was born in Brighton and I grew up in Guernsey. We moved there when I was eight, about the same time as I got the Amiga.
I think it was a present for dealing with moving to Guernsey. Anyway, the leisure center there, it's called Beaux-Ajours. I think it means have a good day or something.
It's Portuguese. I don't know. Anyway.
So they used to have an arcade in there. I went there and they used to have just like Double Dragon or games that were like Double Dragon that were way worse, or vertical shooters and a bunch of games that you kind of like, do I even really want to bother playing this when you get there? But you're going to anyway.
But then one day we came and I'd heard about this game that was there, Street Fighter 2, got there, saw it, saw the giant character. They felt like giant characters at the time, these huge sprites. I think my first memory of it was seeing Dalsim with the stretchy arms and just being like, if this is it, I'm in forever now.
This is now my life. So I got the Street Fighter 2 pack for a Christmas, I think when I was 10 or something. I've been obsessed ever since, probably less so now in terms of fighting games.
But back then, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter 2, that was it for me, and just martial arts in general.
Was there a big fighting game community on Guernsey?
Every community is the same in Guernsey because there's so few people. It's just one community. But yeah, we definitely played a lot, like me and the other kids, either in the arcade or playing a hell of a lot around people's houses.
But yeah, there wasn't like... No, there was no... It's a weird place, honestly.
It's a weird place to go. There's only 60,000 people and it's 24 square miles. So you kind of know everybody's business at all times.
Like being in a second town in a Japanese RPG or something, and there's like eight NPCs there and like one shop, you know? How much is it? Well, it's funny because I forgot that you grew up in Guernsey because I used to talk to you so much about Southampton because I always thought, here's a guy who understands the South Coast and therefore like my life on some level.
That was certainly, which is ridiculous, but it's just something, part of what I remember talking to you about, talking about St. Denny's, talking about St. Denny's train station. So you moved inland again at a certain point, right?
Yeah, so I went to uni in Southampton. So I moved as soon as I could get out of Guernsey, I did finish school and then went to uni in Southampton and was there for six years. And I think maybe when we met, I was, no, I just moved to Bournemouth at that point.
So I did that the first nearly a year of working in Bournemouth at the Games Mag, still living in Southampton. Yeah, it's St. Denny's train. You want to talk about St. Denny's train station?
Is that why you got Bournemouth Weekend?
No, that's just distracting, isn't it? I will ask from there then, how did you, I mean, did you always want to work in games media? Were Games Mags a part of the way you consume games growing up as well?
It was literally all I cared about. That's not true because I cared about football as well. But in terms of a job, I just couldn't really wrap my head around how that was a job.
And I remember reading like Games Master magazine called Total, if you remember that one, it was similar, probably similar stuff. And I just couldn't really wrap my head around that that could be a job. Growing up in Guernsey, everybody pretty much has the same career path.
They finish school and then they go into the finance industry. And it's like a well, it's a very well-paying career path, but it just was never ever ever going to be for me. That just felt like you kind of prescribed this life almost, which is quite a privileged existence if you go through it, but it's just also something that would make me want to top myself.
But then looking in these magazines and seeing the little like cartoons of the people as it was in the 90s, I was just like, man, I just want to do this. Like that just looks amazing. To be able to talk about games, to be able to write about them, to be able to sit and be paid to play them just felt like a magical life that I really, really wanted.
And so through the teenage years in particular, like I had a tough time at school. I got bullied, like I said before, I was quite lonely. So I used to dive into these magazines and really obsess, like I said, starting with Games Master, Total, Super Play, you know, we're really going back.
And then it was reading Edge magazine around that same time, probably a little bit before the PlayStation came out, where I didn't really understand exactly what they were talking about at 12 years old. I remember the first time I picked it up actually in a newsagents in Guernsey and going straight to the back of it looking for cheats because all the magazines had cheats in the back and I was like, there's no cheats. Fuck this.
I'm not buying this shit. But I came back to it a bit later. And yeah, obviously we all know the deal, but the level of depth and the sort of respect that games were being treated with in that magazine really opened my eyes to the whole medium in general.
And I just completely lost myself in it. I just threw myself fully into that obsession. So I was completely on top of it in the way like pre-internet, pre-everything, really on top of all the new releases, really on top of the news and then really on top of the writing side.
And I wasn't writing myself back then when I was a teenager at all, but I was just absorbing it all, I think, through those years. And I did film at university, film studies, but I think had there been a video game studies, there may be is now, I don't know. That's actually what I wanted to do, but it just didn't exist.
Yeah, I mean, what an absolute sort of like grift that would be to teach that course, you know? Sounds like a great life if you can get it. You know, you did get your first job on Games TM and you were there, I think you were there for some of the Paragon, Hybrid, Collapse shenanigans, because I just strictly remember you telling me a story about how you played Halo 2 multiplayer for a month because there was nothing else to do.
That's a story I have rattling around at the back of my head. Does any of that sound right? How did you end up on Games TM, I guess, is the question.
All of these things are things I have said, but you've got the timeline ever so slightly wrong, but shout out to you for knowing any of that because that was a long time ago. So I just might as well go back. Out of uni, I, like everyone, just had to get a normal job.
So I worked at HSBC doing data entry in going back to Southampton again. When you stop at Southampton train station, and if any of the listeners know it, and look, if you're going towards London, if you look out the left window in your train, you will see the most grizzly, grim looking tower block looking things outside of the train station. And I don't know if they still are, but that's where they housed HSBC's like trading area in Southampton.
I didn't even really know what I was doing, to be honest, but traders within that block had like real jobs. They would do the trades and then we would have to input numbers from these pieces of paper all day every day into three separate ancient creaking computer programs. It definitely, definitely isn't done like this anymore.
And it was utterly soul destroying. So I did that for 14 months. And I was at the point where my spirit was almost broken.
And I came home one day knowing that I just could not do it anymore. And for some reason, I typed in the word Star Friday into the website monster.co.uk. You know, it used to be a jobs website.
I don't think it is anymore. And the only reason I even knew those two words next to each other is because, like I said, from reading so many games mags for so many years in my teenage years. And weirdly, this job popped up on there in Bournemouth.
And I was in Southampton at the time. Obviously, they're only about half an hour away from each other. And it was for the magazine P2, which is a PlayStation magazine, which I'd actually never heard of, which is, I couldn't believe it.
I mean, I knew every, I thought I knew all the magazines, but I was just like, well, yeah, obviously I'm going to try and apply for this. I'll try and do anything. And then I got a phone call back the next day and they asked me what my expectations for salary were.
I was just like, I mean, I think I was on like 5 pound 50 an hour as a 10 per HSBC. So I said, I don't know, 16,000 a year. And they were like, yes, 10,000 a year.
I was like, oh, that's fine. Why did you ask? But still, okay, yeah, whatever, I'll make it work.
They went and had an interview there in P2. It was a strange one because this was the pace. I mean, Paragon slash Highbury, which published Cube magazine.
It published Games TM, obviously, P2, Play Magazine. So it had some famous mags that I'd read over the years, but I'd never heard of P2. So when I went for my interview, in my mind, I just said, I'm going to interview as if I'm going to work at Games TM.
Did well in the first one, got asked back for a second one. That was with two people, a guy called Nick Roberts, you'll probably know from the past. We worked at Imagine.
Did you work at Imagine at the same time as him? Anyway.
Yeah, he was my boss on Games TM.
Yeah. And again, it was another interview for P2. But again, I just answered it and answered all the questions as if I was going to work on Games TM.
There wasn't a job going on Games TM. And then I got a phone call after the interview about a week later saying that I had a job on Games TM. They'd recommended me for a job that didn't exist yet on Games TM.
So I just believe that I bent the universe to my will that day in those interviews and managed to get the job, which didn't exist, on Games TM and started at 22 years old. I think it was May 05, I think. And that was in the fabled, it wasn't Paragon anymore, which it had been when I used to buy the magazine.
So I remember it was either a future magazine or a Paragon magazine. And realistically, I like the future magazines more, but you know, you just take what you get. We all did.
And yeah, but when I joined, it was Highbury. And that lasted, so when did I join? May.
And that became defunct, I think, in December of that same year. So first three, four months are amazing. Like really, really great vibes working in that place, much more chaotic and had an energy to it that Imagine didn't really have.
You know, that you'd go in a cupboard and you'd find something from a million years ago, some disk from like the Super Nintendo area or something. And that was just absolutely everywhere. The place was a complete pigsty.
The games room was just packed with like old consoles that had been shoved in the corner for 10 years and gathering dust. So it was just this, it had like a real energy to it, a real sense of place to it. And the first three or four months are great because you're just writing for your dream magazine, the team were really cool.
The other teams around, it was all kind of open plan. There weren't really like dividers in between the desks or anything. So it just had a great atmosphere.
And then it started to feel like things were going very, very wrong. A lot of important looking people walking around the place looking very serious. And when you're 22, people, why is there people in their 40s walking around looking serious?
This doesn't seem good. And then I have a memory of my editor at the time, Martin Mathers, who's still in the games industry, I believe, with his head on the desk while someone, one of those important people were standing over him telling him to pick his head off the desk. And that's probably not a good thing.
And then other things started happening. So I think Kelvin McKenzie bought it very briefly. Now, you know who he is, obviously, there.
Oh, yeah. So he came and I think bought this failing company. And I remember him coming into the office, getting everybody's kind of like stand around and then like yelling at us that he was going to sort it all out.
And I heard a story from another editor who I didn't know at the time, but actually went on to be the game CM editor, a guy called Paul, that he went into a meeting with him. I think he was running a film magazine at the time. And basically, Kelvin McKenzie was getting all the senior management into individual interviews.
Apparently, this guy, Paul, started explaining like about his, I think it was DVD review magazine, started explaining about the magazine, started explaining about what his role was. And Kelvin McKenzie just reached into his pocket and pulled out a huge roll of 20 pound notes and started counting them in front of him without saying anything.
What an era. And then about a week after that, oh, should I tell the story about Unlucky Matt? I think I should tell the story about Unlucky Matt.
So a week after that, two weeks before the whole place shut, Cube hired a guy called Matt. And the first day that he started, I mean, I don't know why they hired someone in this situation, but the first day that he started, all the electricity went out in the whole building. So it was impossible to do any work and we're all just sat around and eventually we all had to go home.
So his first day was just sitting there in the dark. Second day was a press event, like a Christmas meal that Rockstar were taking us on. So they organized a mini-bus or like a coach actually, to take us all to like a really nice restaurant.
I think it was supposed to be about 15 minutes away from the place where we worked to go and meet them. They were already waiting there, the Rockstar reps, the PRs. And we were going to go and meet them there for Christmas lunch.
And Matt was on this thing, not really knowing what was going on, because it was only the second day on the job. But the coach driver, it was supposed to be to Farnham in Hampshire, but the coach driver took us to Farnham in Surrey, which is about, I don't know, a good 90 minutes away from Southampton. And yeah, Rockstar were phoning some of the editors who were on this coach, going like, where the fuck are you?
Like what the hell is going on? And then yeah, we figured out that we'd been taken to Farnham in Surrey. And then by the time we got all the way back to Farnham in Hampshire, it was, well we still had a meal with Rockstar, but it was a complete disaster of a day.
We basically had dinner with them. And then the third day that Matt worked at Cube, they shut Cube.
Wow, that's like a fucking Twilight Zone episode.
So that was Unlucky Matt, and I never saw him again.
That's good. We didn't name his surname. So, you know, we'll never hear.
Do you remember his surname?
No, no, no.
Do we ever go find this guy? No, no one knows.
It's just Unlucky Matt.
I want to uncover that now.
I know.
That's like, yeah, that's a great, I've got a great Eurogamer feature written all over it. The Tale of Unlucky Matt. Wow.
Yeah.
And then a week after that, we all walked into, well, everybody was walking into the office to start at 9.30 as usual, and there was just a note on the door of the office that it was shut. Nobody was allowed in and we were all to go to the Marriott Hotel like up the big hill in Bournemouth near the beach. You'll know where that is, Sam used to live near it.
And that was it. So all of the journalists, all the games journalists, all the creative journalists, everybody's sales team and everything just trekked up this hill, sat in the conference room, I guess, of the Marriott, and then Damien Barth walks in. I had no idea who he was because he had left.
He was like the previous MD of Paragon, and then had come back and bought all the magazines at Song. Yeah, that was just before Christmas. And then we had a three-week consultation period where they were going to decide whether or not we had jobs to come back to after Christmas.
So yeah, that was wild. But I won, I got the job. So I don't know what happened to everybody else, but I just remember the people that got the jobs.
Wow.
So that was that fiasco.
When did you play Halo 2 for a month? Did I imagine that?
You didn't? I'd forgotten about that, sorry. That was when I was briefly unemployed between HSBC.
Actually, technically, I did three weeks of putting letters in envelopes, working for Scandia Bank as a temp, listening to The Mighty Boosh podcast. That was actually all right for three weeks. Then that temp job ended.
So this was during the interview process for the Games Mag. So I didn't want to get something else, another temp job because I really thought I was probably going to get this job. So I had three weeks of unemployment, and I just played Halo 2 all day, every day, and it was really, really good.
But that wasn't in the in-between Imagine and Hybrid times. That I actually played Shadow of the Colossus. I found out I got the job while fighting the final boss of Shadow of the Colossus.
Got the phone call during that moment.
That probably burned that game into my brain as an all-time favorite. That moment had happened in conjunction with that. So I got a lot of affection for the original Motor Storm, which is a game I played during my interview to write a short review of.
So you were very passionate about Gamestem. What was it like working on that mag? Because I think that the era you worked on it with Handrahan, Ash, Rick was probably its strongest era editorially.
I say that as somebody who ran the mag later on. I think you just really figured out what it was and when they had that redesign, and it looked a little bit more like Edge. It took that step up editorial, I think.
So what was the Gamestem experience like?
It was really good. It was really, really good. At Highbury, I still think it had a bit of an inferiority complex about it compared to Edge, which it kind of was an inferior Edge.
That's basically what the magazine was. Despite that, it was still very enjoyable, like a really cool team, Rick Porter, Luke El-Bajay, Darren Jones, who still runs RetroGamer, absolute legend. He was running the Retro section, a sub-editor, two designers, an editor.
Can you imagine a magazine team with that many people on? It's unbelievable. So, and then Kesa MacDonald as well, who got a job shortly after I did.
It was just a good atmosphere. Everybody was fighting in the same direction to try and do the best possible magazine they could. It was big, 180 pages.
Then we moved across to Imagine, and we had to get an issue out in a week, basically, because of this crazy period. So I have a bone to pick with UK Resistance. I need to get this on record.
You know, UK Resistance, the blog. So there's a very famous piece on there about someone who took really bad screenshots of Outrun Coast to Coast, I think it was. It went viral in the games industry at the time.
And that was me. And the reason that happened, they were shit screenshots. But we had a week to do 180 page magazine.
And I was very upset because I got a lot of grief for that viral piece from UK Resistance. And now I just feel like there's a moment to express, so I can let it go. So that happened.
And then a new team was established at Imagine. And the guy called Paul Morgan, the same guy who told the story about the Kelvin Mackenzie and the money, he was running the magazine. And he allowed us to really come up with a new identity for GameCM.
We really like the idea of it becoming more like the total film or empire for games. So still very serious in terms of how seriously it took the subject matter, but not necessarily be sort of just an inferior edge. Basically, GameCM had always tried to be edgy.
And this was our moment to try and be a GameCM. And I think there was about a year there where it really was going pretty strong. I was pretty proud of what we did with the redesign.
We started to actually be able to get bylines in some of the writing as well, because for some reason it did the edge thing where you weren't allowed to have your name after it. But, you know, I don't know why that exists. Yeah, it was just a cool time.
And I can imagine it was a very toxic place to work compared to Highbury. It didn't have the crackle and the fizz of Highbury in that squished building in the roof of basically what is TK Maxx now in Bournemouth. It was a bit weird at first because there were some people who had established the company and worked on 360 magazine, obviously had Retro Gamer magazine.
Darren had moved across. So there was a little bit of like this influx of us lot coming in and people who had been there for a year or so or nine months or so have along the company had been around. There's a little bit of tension and weirdness there.
Definitely the culture thing was interesting because it felt like basically a bunch of mostly boys from gaming were existing in one culture and then there was the corporate culture above that. That was a weird thing to me. I was like, well, I'm getting what I perceived to be the quintessential magazine team experience I'd read about in magazines.
At least when I moved to X360 a little bit later into being there, not so much when I was on play actually. Elsewhere in the office, you could meet people you really clicked with. But yeah, I feel like I did miss out on the hybrid thing.
It did sound like it was very ramshackle but in quite a charming way. You mentioned P2. I've never heard more anecdotes about one editor than the editor of P2, a man I've never met but who I know had a box of reason bars under his desk.
Apparently like multiple boxes of snacks from various wheelings and dealings. The reason bar thing has always stuck with me. So yeah, sounded like we didn't really have anyone like that, I imagine.
He interviewed me. He was like one of the driving forces behind me getting the job in the first place. But man, yeah, he was a character indeed.
He took advantage of every possible freebie he could get regardless of quality at all times. Essentially, you know the Iron Throne in Game of Thrones? Yeah.
We imagine if that was made out of Rustler's Burgers. That's basically what he inhabited at the end of his like desk complex, literally surrounded by Rustler's Burgers. I think he'd done some sort of thing.
Well, he must have done some sort of deal with them. He definitely didn't buy them. A quite incredible man, a man who ordered two steaks at a press lunch.
I heard stories about him in the future for sure, without ever knowing really who he was and meeting this person.
The legends were really something.
He was something else, man.
We met in 2007. I joined in March 2007, I imagine, and I was definitely a child. And you used to tell me that I can't believe you're the same age as my brother and you're doing this job, my little brother.
And I thought that was kind of funny. But I definitely was a kid there. And you were my first ever press lunch with Eidos in Wagamama, the first time I'd ever been to a Wagamama before.
I thought it was incredibly exotic. You know, we were taken there by Roxy at the time from Eidos. Yeah, that's when we first properly met and had a conversation.
And then we went to New York that July on a press trip to Rockstar. So I suppose I should ask why, you know, I didn't ask Andrew Hand this, but I should have done. But probably because I didn't want to hear Andrew Hand's answer to this question.
But what are your memories of working with me, John?
You just used to make me laugh, like, pretty much immediately from when I first spoke to you. Yeah, I remember you sitting there, there's always like, oh, there's a new person. I'm just like, let's all stare at this new person, try and figure them out.
Turns out we're all pretty much the exact same person, give or take.
Yeah, not much diversity in that office, really.
No. A nerd is obsessed about video games and another one. I think because you were the same age as my younger brother, who's nearly eight years younger than me, I felt a little bit of that kind of bigger brother energy, a little bit chatting to you because to come into that environment, and we were all pretty young, but to come into that environment at 18 years old is crazy.
To be fair, to shout out to Keza, who was 16 when she came into that environment at Highbury, which is even crazier to think about. But I think she made it. Did she left by the time that you started?
Just before I joined, yeah, she was gone.
Maybe you were like a roundabout replacement because they used to move people around and stuff. Anyway, I just have lots of memories of laughing a lot with you. I think we share and still do, I'm sure, a quite similar sense of humour in terms of being a bit dry, hearing things that are perhaps in between the things that people say and finding that very funny, but not in a way that you can laugh at loudly.
So you kind of have to keep it a little bit surreptitious. So there was a bit of that, definitely. And yeah, I mean, that's about it.
Like, what do you want me to say? You're a dickhead or something. No, you're a lovely, lovely young guy.
That's very nice to say. I see. I remember in my head, I remember it as me being quite petulant and argumentative and quite annoying and sort of like eventually aging out of it.
And I think it's just because I was super, super young. So when I'd like clash with someone, I'd really clash with them. And yes, yeah, that's, that's the sort of thing I sort of mellowed out of that for the most part.
That's what I remember about myself. So it's just interesting hearing your point of view on it, really.
Yeah, I mean, you definitely got into a few beefs back then. Yeah. And I remember you getting very, very frustrated that you didn't want to defend your corner about the game that you'd been reviewing that you either liked or didn't like.
And we were like, yeah, no, no, I always think it's good. Why do you think it's shit? You're like, I don't care.
It's just my opinion. But...
Yeah, see, that's what I wanted to hear. Yeah. That's familiar.
Cause yeah, I don't remember doing that, but it's exactly the kind of thing I would do. That's yeah, completely plausible to me.
Another piece of the puzzle slots into place.
This is the thing. I've never known Sam the manager, Sam the editor, Sam the responsible grown up. I've only ever really known Sam the kid, really, and staff writer.
And then I'd gone by the time you were making your way up the various ladders. So yeah, it's funny.
Because I mean, everyone and everyone was in that same age bracket as you, really. They were like early to mid 20s. So I remember just being in an office, working with all the women who worked on the creative mags and thinking, everyone here is like a proper age bracket above me.
I wonder, I remember walking through the office thinking, I wonder if I seem egregiously young to all these other people, or if it's just not perceptible because maybe I look a couple of years older than I actually am or whatever. And being quite self-conscious about that. But you're right, you were gone by 09.
So I was 20 when you left. And sorry if it makes you sound like you're my dad or something. Sorry.
Let's move on from that.
What did you guys go and see in New York together?
It's the defining anecdote that binds the two of us. This is the trip, isn't it really?
This is the trip, yeah. So yeah, we should get into it really. Do you want to go with me?
I've told this story in the podcast before. I went to New York to watch GTA IV. It's like a world exclusive for, probably like a local exclusive for Games TM and Play, the mags were on at the time.
And you know, it's the story where I insist a cab pulls over and have a piss at the roadside because I had like two or three beers before getting in the cab to go to the airport. And it was like a peak kind of New York experience. But you were there the entire time on this trip and every now and then I get photos come up on the old Facebook Memories thing.
And it's what I recognize to be John Denton more or less what you look like now, to be honest, you look basically the same. And a dumpy boy, who is me, wearing shorts. I was already like gaining weight in my first few months of being there.
But yeah, so what do you what memories do you have of this trip?
It was my second time in America, second time with Rockstar. And then, yeah, first time away with you, I think.
Yeah.
Yeah. I can remember it really vividly. I'm pretty sure that you had a bagel for breakfast, because I'm sure that's a photo that reappears on my Facebook.
You sat there in your shorts eating a bagel at the breakfast place in the hotel that we stayed at.
I will include that in the episode post on Patreon for the listeners to enjoy that photo. I mean, it'll be Photoshopped forever after that in our Discord, but that's okay. That is correct.
Yeah. So we spent the first... Well, we got there quite late as you do.
And I remember it being really amazing for both of us coming over the Brooklyn Bridge for the first time and just seeing like the skyline appear as two people who'd grown up with cinema and video games and GTA 3 and whatnot. So that was a really special moment. Got to the hotel really late, got some sleep.
And then the next day we just spent exploring New York with PJ, the PR, awesome guy from Rockstar, big Australian guy. And it was just funny. I just remember laughing a hell of a lot as we...
I think we saw the old Ghostbusters thing. Was that right? The library?
Yeah, that's right.
We went to Little Italy for a pizza. Yeah, went to Central Park. I got accosted, do you remember this?
I got accosted by one of those people that tries to sell you their mixtapes.
I do remember this.
In Times Square. This guy, he shouted, I love white people. And he put his hand up to give me a high five.
And I gave him a high five. And then within seconds, he was like getting money, not taking money out of my wallet, but making me take money out of my wallet to give me his CD. I think he was called Jeezy.
I had the CD for ages. I don't have it anymore, but I had it for years and years.
I remember he was called Young G.
Oh, well done.
Because I remember talking to you about how, isn't that name a bit too close to Young Jeezy? That was a conversation we had after that incident where you were kind of mugged.
I mean, willingly and consentingly mugged. Yeah, for about $12. Yeah, just a really fun trip.
And then the next day, the final day that we were there, we went to Rockstar's offices in Broadway, I think it is, and watched GTA 4, which I remember being really blown away by. I don't know about you, just the... It was amazing.
They did a really good presentation. It was like a really intimate one just in their, like, I don't know, gaming presentation area. Me and you and like, I don't know, maybe three Rockstar employees or something like that.
So compared to some of the giant presentations that you go to in this job where there's like 50 journalists or more on a big cinema screen, this was... They did it, they always did it very differently, Rockstar, very intimately. And I think maybe it was a 20, 30 minute demo, we could ask questions.
Incredibly impressive. I remember you being excited that they had Bully on like a demo pod while we were waiting. So you went and played Bully.
I was listening to the one you're talking about that the other day. So that reminded me of that moment. And then, yeah, we had a little bit of time to kill, didn't we?
In between finishing at Rockstar's offices and going back to the airport. So PJ took us to a bar and yeah, we sat down and had a couple of points and I know you've told this story, but it's not been told from the other person's perspective before, so...
Let's rash them on this.
So yeah, we did. We had a couple of points. And I think despite the fact that we come in in a cab, both of us had underestimated quite how long it takes to get in a cab from Central Manhattan to JFK.
If you've not done it, it's a good like hour plus, right? Pushing sort of one hour, 15 minutes and it was traffic.
In traffic, yeah, for sure. It definitely takes over an hour.
Yeah, yeah. What happened is we had points and then we went to the bathroom. But I think that might have been the fatal mistake because that may have broken the seal.
As anybody who drinks beer knows, that once you go for the first piss, yeah, you're on a 20-minute cycle. And so we're just in the back of the cab, probably knackered from the trip, you know, jet lag and whatever. And it's fine for the first half an hour.
And then I start to see Samuel squirm. And I kind of can tell what's happening because I'm also feeling similar. But the level of squirm gets to, what is quite extraordinary levels.
I've never seen anything like it really. There's about 10 minutes of real concern, real concern that you're going to piss yourself like drastic. This is the most serious moment of my entire life level of concern.
And then it becomes quite clear that we're not really anywhere near the airport yet. We're just stuck in this giant, like what might as well be an infinitely lane freeway in this guy's car. He doesn't, I mean, he definitely spoke English, but it wasn't his first language.
It was, I think there was loud music. And at that point it goes from concern with you to genuine panic, where I just have this abiding memory of you trying to climb. You had your feet on the seat and you were back, you're backing into the top left corner of the back of the car, completely freaking out that you were going to piss yourself.
I think you were mere seconds away. And the guy just being utterly baffled looking in his rear-view mirror, like, what the fuck are these English guys doing? At this point I was also absolutely busting for a piss, but I probably had about 10 more minutes in me than you did at that moment.
I don't know why it hit you so hard, but it definitely did. Sheer unadulterated panic to the point where between all three of us, I don't think at that point you were capable of talking. Between me and PJ, we insisted that the guy pulled over to the edge of the freeway and you went out desperately and just, I mean, I don't even know how you didn't piss yourself, but you managed to get it onto the tarmac instead of onto yourself.
As I was watching it happen, I was like, you know what, as we're here, I might as well do it as well, seeing as it's already happening. So I popped out and joined you and we stood side by side laughing, pissing on the freeway while a million cars honked at us and then sheepishly got back in the car and finished the journey to JFK. But I will never forget the memory of you trying to climb backwards out of the roof of the car.
Yeah, it was like a bunch of things that were compounding my panic. It was my first international trip and it was Rockstar and it was America and it just felt and it was GTA, like the biggest game in the world. The stakes felt high and I just thought, I mean, if I'm the guy, I mean, I think this is what I thought is so long ago now.
I think I just thought, if I'm the guy who pisses himself in a cab on a GTA press trip, that's all I am in this industry forever. So getting the piss onto the tarmac was arguably my greatest achievement working in games media because it saved the rest of my career wouldn't have happened if I hadn't have done that. So, you know, it makes you think, you know.
There would be no Back Page had you, yeah, had the flyers got stuck.
We wouldn't be talking about unlucky Matt.
No, unlucky Sam. Yeah, worked there for two months, pissed himself. We never saw him again.
Yeah, and it went back to working one stop after that. So, yeah, I mean, so after you worked on Games TM, you went through something that happened to me that I hated. You were moved to a different magazine, which you didn't want.
You ran through 60 Magazine, which was a perfectly solid outlet. But it came out at some point. It came out every three weeks.
I know that started happening when you were running it. But, you know, it was an intensive magazine to put together. You did that for about two years.
What was it like running your first mag?
Yeah, it was wild. So yeah, I was still on GameCM. I got called into a meeting with Rick, who was the editor at the time, and telling me I was actually going to be moved to play.
And I was like, why? And the reasons being that, oh, this is the only way that you can kind of go to the next level. Fine.
But I was just like, okay, I'll do it. But I don't want to go on to play because it was like PS3 era. I said, I don't want to fucking work on a PlayStation magazine in PS3 era.
So it was like early PS3 as well. It's like, what am I going to talk about there? I mean, Jesus Christ, don't do this to me.
So yeah, I managed to finagle it. So I got moved on to 360 and a guy called Gav got moved off that onto play, which is a bit harsh in retrospect. But yeah, I was the deputy editor, but as is the way in those magazines, there was no editor.
So I was the editor without being paid as one. And then yeah, about card. I can't remember how long into the magazine.
It was probably about eight months after working there. We got called into a different meeting, was told it was going from a four-weekly magazine to a three-weekly magazine because there was an competitor magazine also published in Bournemouth called 360 Gamer, which was outselling 360 and was three-weekly. It was cheaper.
It came out every three weeks. And so 17 issues a year. And we were going to do the same.
So then I had to go and break it to my team that we were going to do this 17 issues instead of 13 for no extra money, no extra budget and no extra staff. And the only the only thing that I had in my in my locker in my pocket really to to make it so they didn't mutiny was that that very same day so many people in America from I think one up in America were laid off. It was like one of the first major layoffs of of that era.
So I just used that as kind of fuel was like this sucks. Sorry, Samuel's just posted the picture with me in the bagel and the discord. It's fucking completely throwing me.
I thought that he was typing. I thought, Oh, no, my mic's broken or something.
But no, no, you're all good. I'm sorry to completely throw off your train of thought there, but I thought it was an important artifact for the purposes of it's really important.
It's very important.
That's the law.
That's that's like my life law. That is a bit so. Yeah, 17 issues instead of 13.
So the only way to do is by becoming incredibly organized, which is not something I'm naturally good at. And the whole classic way of running a magazine where you piss about for the first week, maybe think about what you're going to do for the second week and then cram everything into the third week and kill yourself in the fourth week, it just could not be done. Like it could not be done.
So we actually had to run the thing like a really tight ship. And the weird thing is I did that for, I mean, I probably did 20 issues on that three weekly schedule. And we never worked past deadline, and we never worked over time, and I never sent a magazine late, just purely through the organization, working with very good freelancers who are quick and would hand stuff in on time.
It was bloody hard though. It was really unpleasant to have to do that. Obviously, everyone else is doing four weekly.
And we were just having to work that much harder than everybody else and that much sharper than everybody else to get this thing done. So yeah, it was just a road to burnout really, because as much as it was organized and I wasn't working ridiculous hours, we were having to be so sharp within the hours that we did work. And of course, all of us were still doing freelance in our evenings in order to be able to just make ends meet, as is the way in that world.
So yeah, it was just a road to burnout and eventually I couldn't do it anymore.
Which is fair enough. I mean, I didn't know why they ever even looked at 360 Gamer and thought, this is the thing we want to aspire to beat or whatever. It was so clearly not as well produced as the imagined mags.
I didn't really understand it. 360 and X360 were like close superficially close together, but actually quite distinct mags. Yeah, the idea that you will enter that cycle.
I mean, I would probably create the most basic ass new section if I had to do that. It would be like one caption and then like a double page spread piece of key art. There would be like nine spreads like that in a magazine that I ran going out every three weeks.
But yeah, I could see why it burned you out. So, you know, after that you left. Did you just think I'll take a chance on freelance?
So, you know, I can make money from Imagine. It was still a pretty good era for that sort of thing. What sort of happened from there?
During this period of like, I was so burnt out, I was just absolutely exhausted. And I took a week off and I just basically lay in bed for a week just to try and recover because I was really getting quite unwell during the end of that period. And I came back and I came back to a fucking really intense scathing email from my boss at the time killing me for leaving the mag in a bad state.
And I read that and I immediately just opened up a Word document and typed, please accept my letter of resignation, signed John Denton, printed out and then handed it to him. I was just like, fuck this, I'm done. Nothing to go to, no idea, no plan, just quit.
There and then, classic me, not the first time I've done that, probably the last, even though I work for myself these days. And yeah, we just had no, just like fucking just burn the boats as they say. But I was just completely gone at that point.
To come back to that, at that moment, I can understand now, years later, because I did leave the magazine and the shit and he probably didn't realize how bad it had been for me. But at the moment, in my reality, it was an unacceptable thing to come back to, considering how much I've been doing and not even being the editor, you know, as a deputy editor. So I just jumped off and fortunately I didn't, during that last month, I think it was a month's notice, I made sure that I did everything, all my due diligence and really didn't burn any bridges despite burning boats.
So there was a chance that I could still freelance for Imagine magazines after I left, which I was able to, which was really good. And then started doing some freelance for Future as well. And I started doing like mobile game reviews for very like a 10, maybe 10 pounds a pop for Eurogamer.
I think that might be harsh on him, it might have been more money than that. But this was going, this was a long time ago, right, 09. And that eventually led to some more dense work from Eurogamer.
So I did some of their like retrospectives, which was really fun. Did some reviews for those guys. And basically wrote for anyone and everyone who'd have me.
Apart from Edge, I've never written for Edge, that's the only publication. Yeah, I never managed it. That was always one to tick off the bucket list, but it never happened, unfortunately.
But anyone and everyone else over the years, I pretty much wrote for them all, especially the print and newspapers. Not so much online, a little bit. Obviously Eurogamer, maybe GameSpot, I don't know.
I'm literally just listing outlets at this point, which isn't particularly interesting. And then I actually got a job. It's like, yeah, it was a job on Gamerzines, which nobody knows what they are.
But they were a free downloadable PDF magazine that were run by people who actually used to run hybrid when it went under. So no surprise that these also went under. Yeah, so for a while I ran 360zine, and I worked with a guy called Dave Scammel, who is still in the industry, I believe.
Yeah, a top guy and he ran the PlayStation one, and then a guy called Andy Griffith, so I think still in the industry as well. He ran the PC one, and this was a remote job back when that was a novel thing. It was really great, it was just steady money every month.
They actually paid me pretty much the same as I imagined to run this thing. Actually, I say I was able to freelance as well. I thought I was able to freelance and then I got pulled into a disciplinary by them when they found out that I've been freelancing for other people and I had to go through my whole contract and say there's nothing in here that says I can't freelance for other people.
That was a whole drama. And then about a month after that I was made redundant. So I think that might have been one of the reasons.
But you know, all these things are good in retrospect. But yeah, so I did that and did freelance and then that got pregnant in end of 2010. Yeah, like September 2010, found out she was pregnant.
About November 2010, I think I was let go by gamersenes. So that was scary hours for a bit there with the kid on the way. And just scrambling for every little review and preview that I could get.
I didn't really know what I was going to do. And then this weird thing happened where I just got an email in my inbox. It was the kind of thing you just normally ignore, like 99 times out of 100.
And it was from a woman saying that Monster Energy, and I was like, I didn't even really know what that was at the time. We're looking for somebody from the games industry to help them get into games. And I'd been recommended.
Would you like to come in for a meeting? And I was just like, I don't even know what any of this means, but yes.
Okay, fine.
So I went out to London, and I met this woman, Juliet. And I was like, so who did recommend me for this? And she was like, oh, I can't remember.
I don't know. I was like, okay, that's weird. And she took me into Monster's offices in Uxbridge, just like Northwest London.
And I met the team there, and managed to get like a consultancy gig with them, helping them establish themselves in the video games industry, just by, they didn't even really know what they wanted to do in the industry at that point. They just wanted to be in and around it because they'd establish themselves by getting in with music, getting in with the scape scene, getting in with all these different scenes that they wanted to be in and around. And I was like, do you know what?
The people here, they kind of remind me not, they were like a really, really cool version of Imagine. They were like passionate people, they were wearing the clothes that they wanted to wear, they weren't like all button down suit. I thought it was going to be a really corporate thing.
And it wasn't at all, they were way cooler than games journalists, don't get me wrong. They were like escape pros and snowboarders and stuff. But I was like, oh yeah, I could do this.
And obviously, an absolute godsend at the time with a kid on the way to suddenly have a thing that paid a bit better than games journalism. And it was an interesting new world to explore. And I was just given a task of, this was one of my favorite tasks I've ever been given, go and make as many friends as you can in game studios and publishers and press and send them drinks if they want them.
And that was my job for like three or four months just to make friends. And I was like, what? It's fucking...
And I got paid to do that. That was great. And then I worked with them for years and years and years, establishing the whole gaming program for Europe, Europe, Middle East and Africa, with them signing YouTubers, working with e-sports teams, signing massive events, activating big giant structures at events and stuff.
It was a really cool thing to be able to do. It was something I never thought that I'd end up doing and sending a lot of drinks to a lot of people as well, including Samuel, I think, I believe, if I remember correctly.
Yes, that is correct. You did send loads and loads of crates of Monster to the PC Gamer office. And I always thought you were mad because I didn't tweet about getting them, but it was right as Gamergate was kicking off.
Right.
And so I just sort of like awkwardly didn't say anything. But we drank every single one of them. And I'm currently drinking a white Monster energy drink.
So in a way, I feel like you made that company a lot of money in the long term because that became like a real problem for me, the white ones. But yeah, that is true. You sent me loads and I was just a bit awkward about it.
And I probably should have just said, hey, I can't tweet about this. I hope we're still cool though.
I don't think I was expecting you to tweet about it.
Oh, that's good. I think I always assumed that was like a weird point of tension we'd never addressed. So I'm glad to hear that's not the case.
I think once it was called, it was just like we just want people to think that we're cool. That was the ethos at the time. It's like you don't need to talk about it, you don't need to tweet it, you don't need to do anything.
Just think that we're cool. That's it because that was their whole idea to make the brand work and it really worked. And it changed in the later years where they started being a bit more corporate and advertising at football and things, which they would never have done before.
But that was another strange part of my life. But yeah, I'm sorry that you've been hanging on to this guilt for 12 years or something. That's terrible.
No, it's just classic me being a bit awkward unnecessarily. And it's all good. But yeah, this is not an endorsement now, by the way, I think they've probably done some real damage to me, these things, but they have made thousands of pounds out of me at this point.
So yeah, really, really played the long game with that one.
I've never drunk Monster in my life.
Yeah, you're a very civilized man, aren't you, Matthew? You only have sort of like, you know, coke and stuff, like drinks that a 10-year-old might enjoy, you know?
Well, it was around this time as well, because I remember Tom East on O&M left to be on the quite early iteration of like Red Bull gaming website. Like, I felt like all the energy drinks were trying to get in on games. Yeah, as someone who didn't consume any of these things, I was never invited to it.
If Rio had set up a gaming portal, Rio Gaming, I would have been all over, I would have been the face of that happily.
Yeah. That's the thing is like, I could never, the optics of energy drinks are always just a funny one, because like, even in football, is it Jamie Vardy who's obsessed with Red Bull? Jon, is that right?
Yeah. Yeah, so he's like synonymous with that. It's kind of like a punchline, but I know people still kind of respect him on some level, but yeah, in any case.
So I did want to ask what are the games you associate with your time at Imagine? What's attached to that period in your head?
Gears of War, definitely the first one. There was a big debate around whether or not that should get a 10 out of 10. It was Matt Handrahan actually on the review for that one.
But I think I took it home as well over the weekend. He was in the review in the office and then I took the debug kit home over the weekend and played it myself as I think I was the reviews editor at the time. And we were adamant that it should be a 10 out of 10.
But Simon Phillips, who was the EIC at the time, didn't think that it should be because man, this is how stupid the job is. He didn't think it should be a 10 out of 10 because he went to a bit and tried to shoot the water and no bullet splashes came up when he shot the water. This was an actual hour long argument.
So anyway, that was defining my... We won the argument in the end and gave it a 10 out of 10. I'm happy about that because I actually just played the reloaded version that came out recently.
I thought I'd just stick it on just to see because it was just on Game Pass. And I played the whole thing again, front to back. And I was like, this was a 10 out of 10 at a time.
And do you know what? In the new one, they added the bullet splashes into that, but I even tested it. So how about that?
Amazing. Just giving Simon Phillips a call 20 years later. By the way, Simon, they finally did it.
Just so you know, we're all good now.
The original Bioshock was something that, again, that was not one I reviewed either. I think that was Matt again. Because we used to have our area in the corner of this, it was like an L-shaped office.
And GameCM was at one edge of it, like the edge of the L, I guess you would call it. And it had its own TV that you could see, or if you look down the L, you could see the TV at the end of the corridor, as it were. And so, yeah, Matt was playing Bioshock at the time.
And I just remember trying not to look at it, but also just peering there and seeing this thing. And obviously, I like those moments where a big game would come in and all of the, there'd be one person on each of the four or five magazines all playing at once. And there was just like, yeah, there was a real kind of crackle to that, those moments, really, really special.
So that was one of them. Playing God of War 2 on that same TV for me. And that was something that I ended up giving a 10 out of 10.
I had to fight for that one because GameCM's 10s weren't quite as precious as Edge's. We decided that they should be a bit more like a five star review in Empire. So you're going to get some throughout the year.
They're not just going to be one every two years or something like that. But at the same time, you had to argue for them. And obviously, a PS2 game that was a sequel to a very good game, but not something that people would consider a 10 out of 10, was a bit controversial at the time.
But I think I've been proven right by history. And yeah, I don't care. Anyway, that's definitely a 10.
And that's the real Kratos, by the way. Not this new guy. This fucking guy is like worried about his feelings, dude.
Just tear some fucking guy's eye down. Shut the hell up.
I think we eventually reach that point ourselves with The God of War Games, because it's like our consensus take on this podcast at three. Is maybe the King God of War Game ultimately, because it's just so gnarly, but unlike any kind of blockbuster in how horrible it is, and nihilistic it is, I think we both kind of dig that.
So yeah, absolutely. And then probably the most memorable game from Imagine is probably the first Assassin's Creed. But I don't know if you wanted to get into that or if you got into that before.
No, I kind of left it because I don't want it. At the time, I think we successfully stopped it from being a thing. But I think it's basically summed up as there's a lot of internal conversation about how much we all didn't like Assassin's Creed versus how much other critics liked it and maybe some tensions that it created.
But then I think we were all proven right when the second one turned out to be a great game. And the first one which got all these eights and nines, I think only a contrarian would say that's a truly great game. It's certainly not too, I think it is.
But yeah, it was interesting. But I would say that is the time when Imagine sort of stuck by its stuff on their takes on that, you know? Yeah, so that was something, you know?
Yeah, they did, to be fair. Yeah, they kind of, I won't go into it, but there was drama with the publisher. But you know, to be fair to them, they did stick by their staff and kind of fought our corner a little bit.
To be fair, it didn't happen later for me on 360. See, the thing is, I'm not in the industry anymore. So I just feel free to talk about whatever, but I don't want to get anybody in sticky situations who still has to maintain relationships.
You probably told all these stories or some of them on your own podcast, I assume, at some point.
I do. But again, I was still in the industry and had connections and relationships to maintain. So I definitely did tell stories, but I haven't spoken to anyone from games in so long.
It just all feels like it's not real anymore to me. So I was just like, oh yeah, just say anything about anybody. And then, oh god, that might be literally their colleague I should be careful about.
Yeah. The tension, the Ubisoft tension, lasted for like two months or something. It was, by the time Haze came out on PS3, you know, it was all fine.
It was a war under the bridge. We went for a cheeseburger at Slug n Lettuce. It was fine, basically.
Yeah. So it wasn't really, because every now and then you'll see that One Sims expansion review by Steve Hogarty doing the rounds, and it was nothing even approaching that as like an explosive bit of drama. It just seemed like a big deal at the moment, you know?
So, yeah.
Yeah, very true.
Well, yeah, those are some key games. I remember you were, I think we're similar in the sense that you were just hyper engaged with like all games, trying to get your arms around everything that was coming out. And, you know, you definitely have some specialist subjects, but you're a big generalist as well.
So, yeah, I think we definitely had that in common. The last thing I want to ask before we take a quick break, Jon, is do you have any other fun press trip stories from your time at Imagine? I'm sort of fishing for your Miami GTA story here, but yeah.
I don't know if you feel comfortable sharing that.
I'll share, yeah. I mean, yeah, I'll share anything. So, yeah, that was the first time I went to the States, was being flown to Miami with the same PR from Rockstar, PJ, for ridiculously for GTA Vice City stories on PSP, which is an outrageously elaborate trip for what is a handheld game.
Yeah. Was there a specific story from that in particular? I can't remember, because a lot of stuff happened on that trip.
The thing I remember is that you both went to watch some kind of like catwalk modeling show, and I think you thought it was going to be all these beautiful women came out, and then it was like men in Speedos or something. I may be elaborating on details there, but I remember you both dying laughing at this being something you had not expected. Is that a thing that happened?
Yes. It was a fashion week inside the hotel we were staying at, which is bizarre, but this was just the type of trip that it was, and we'd sat down to go and watch a show, and then it was just men in tiny Speedos, one after another and us just absolutely dying. But then when we left that and walked past Mickey Rourke, who was staying at the hotel, whose head is enormous.
Like, I've got a big head, I'm a man with a large cranium. His head is like, you've never seen anything like it. I don't even understand how he's even walking around without falling over.
It's like a living Funko Pop.
Guys, what else happened on that trip? We went to Nobu in Miami, I mean, for a PSP game. Anyway, we went to Nobu in Miami, and walked in, and then everybody in this restaurant was staring at one table, like all the women, all the men were just staring at this table, saying, who's so special?
It's over there. I looked over, I was Enrique Iglesias. Okay, fair enough.
Yes, Enrique Iglesias. So there was that, and I met Steven Gerrard on that trip. So they were there after a World Cup.
I think a lot of the Liverpool players had come to Miami for their holidays, and we were walking down the main shops road in Miami. Don't know what it's called, where lots of shops are.
High Street.
Yeah, probably. And I was like, Oh my god, it's Steven Gerrard. I'm going to go and say something to him.
I'm going to go and shake his hand. So I went up to him and said, Oh man, I'm lucky about the World Cup. Thanks for it.
I think he was the England captain at the time. I was like, yeah, thanks for all your hard effort or something. And I put my hands to shake his hand, and he looked at me with a look of sheer disgust, looked away, and then just draped his hand out in front of me.
And I was just like, yeah, I knew I fucking hate Steven Gerrard.
God, that was it. And I did a total of, I reckon, 11 minutes of work on that trip. They took us into one of the hotel suites and played legitimately 10 minutes, one mission of GTA Vice City Stories on PSP, which is fun.
It was really good fun. And that was it. And I was there for three nights.
It really was a different time back then in in games media. But yeah, one of my other favorite stories of a press trip was actually one in England with you going to play GTA 4. Because we did three nights and three days, three, four days in Rockstar's office playing GTA 4 for review.
So we were all in our own individual rooms, sitting there in the dark playing GTA 4, which was really fucking special. That was like one of my favorite things that I've ever done as a games journalist. That experience, being able to do that.
Then in the evenings, we go out like real blurry-eyed, completely sketched out and then go for a meal with Rockstar and the PRs in the evening. I think we went for steaks the first night and carried a second night. Then the third day happened and by this point, my eyes had just completely scrambled, my head's gone.
I think we were all feeling pretty similar. You get on to the tube. Do you know the story that I'm going to tell?
No, I don't actually. I thought you're going to tell the story of how I ate the shell of a king prawn out of politeness because I am...
Oh my god, I completely forgot about that.
Because I was like, I can't really spit it out at this point, so I've got to commit and finish it. And then someone just went, Samuel, are you eating the whole shell of a prawn? And I was like, yeah.
And I just sheepishly fished it out of my mouth. And that's like one... I remember that from the curry night.
That's unbelievable. I've forgotten about that. And I'm listening to you tell me that while I'm still staring at this picture of you eating the bacon, you're talking about together lovely.
You're really getting the worst of me here. But yeah. No, I don't remember this story at all.
Oh, wait. No, I do remember this story now. Please carry on.
Yeah.
So we get onto the train and bear in mind, we're almost delirious at this point just because we'd spent so long in front of these giant 65 inch plasma TVs playing GTA 4.
In pitch black.
In pitch black with no breaks, but the only and then going out for like drinks and food in the two evenings. We got this tube. And we look around and these two, I would say some of the Eastern Asian girls, we're trying to get onto the tube and one gets on, and then the door shuts and the other one's still on the platform.
And they both just stare at each other in utter panic. And then the tube goes and they're both just stood and she's just stood at the window and the other one's just there. And that is two people who are not speaking the language in this country, have no idea what to do, just out of despair.
And me and you being the kind gentlemen that we are, just absolutely died laughing. I think for about, I don't know, about 10 solid minutes, tears, tears of laughter. It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life.
The reason it was so funny, it was not, it was not the fact that they were separated. It was the fact that there was a moment when the doors shut and they looked at each other like, I'm never going to see you again. This is the last time I will ever see you.
And I can't believe this is happening. What a tragedy. And then, like, and then I just, I just kind of knowing in your head that you could just, I'm sure they were going to like one station, they could just meet there in five minutes.
It's no big deal. But there was just a look of like, well, this is, this is, this is it. And this is where I know, this is where we, we part ways forever.
And that was the, I think that's what you're saying about laughing at the things in between other things. Like, that was the reason it was funny. It was not the fact it happened.
It was like that, that just, I still remember vividly the look they gave each other. And it was, yeah, hysterical.
I think we saw that look and then immediately looked at each other and then, yeah. Yeah. I feel like a little fist pump inside, like, did we just both experience that at the same time?
Yeah. Oh God. And it was compounded by, we were just hideously hungover because I think we'd really hit that fancy hotel bar where like beers were like 9.50 or something, which seemed like a lot at the time.
But now it's basically London prices. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I do remember that very well. Yeah.
That third day. I mean, that third day got very little of GTA 4 done. I feel like I was like, you know what?
I'm just going to walk around this city now because I'm actually too hungover to complete these increasingly difficult missions in this game. But yeah, good times. That's like the first part done really.
I thought it would be gone an odyssey here, John, but I still got a lot more I want to ask you about, including the podcast that you started when you were freelance and all the rest of it. So let's take a quick break and we'll come back with some more questions.
Great.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, still got a lot I want to ask Jon about, primarily, Chet and Jon's Reassuringly Finite Gaming Playlist, which is a podcast that ran for, I think, like, was it about four or five years you ran it in the end, Jon?
Just should have 150 episodes, so what's that, just less than three years?
Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. So about 2012 to 2015, or 2011 to 2014, something like that.
Oh mate, that sounds about right, yeah.
Yeah, weird. It just seemed like it was around a long time. I think it was one of those podcasts that was quietly respected by a lot of people.
What led to you starting that, and what's your background with Chet Roivas?
Well, Chet Roivas is not his real name, but I am sworn to not say his real name, is somebody that I met at uni in my first year of uni. He actually left my uni about six months into the course, and went back to go and do whatever the hell he was doing with his life. But for some reason, he and I stayed in touch.
I haven't stayed in touch with anyone else from my course. But we stayed in touch, and then reconnected about a year after I'd finished uni, and basically been really good friends ever since. We'd see each other like three, four times a year because he lived in Brighton, and then London for most of the time that we were doing the podcast.
He was a massive gamer as much as we were. He didn't want to necessarily be a games journalist in the same way that we did, but he did end up being one anyway. But he was as much of a gamer as us, and as deep into it as us.
I don't know why we decided to do a podcast. We actually, this is some real law here, Sam. We actually did a precursor to Chet and John's.
We recorded a podcast together at his flat in Brighton called Chip Damage, which was a single episode, not done in a format, no top 10 list or anything like that, much more of a standard what you've been playing type podcast. But we quite enjoyed doing that, we didn't put it out anywhere. And then I don't know what the hell drove us to actually start the podcast.
But I think it came at a time where I was working on Gamerszene, which I mentioned before. So I had loads of games coming onto my desk, and he was working for Xavi, the retail website, doing the gaming blog for them. And so he had loads of games coming across his desk, and it just made sense to do a podcast.
Yeah, I can't quite remember why we did it, but we were probably talking every single day on text or MSN Messenger, stuff like that.
Yeah, I mean, it's funny because I messaged you this earlier, John, but the one question Matthew really wanted to ask is, who is Chet Roivas? But I know who he is, but I will also keep to maintain the K-Fame.
I don't know why he wants to maintain his identity. I mean, there is no identity to maintain. I say that with love, he'll be listening to this.
But yeah, I'm not going to do it to him. It's just an old mate.
What's the meaning of the name? Because Roy versus Xavier backwards, like is there a meaning in there at all?
Well, it's nowhere near as deep as that.
Okay, fair enough.
He wanted to call himself Chev Royvus because of Chev Chelyos from Crank.
Yeah, you're right. I was overthinking this.
But we realized that Chev Royvus had too much V in there, so he changed it to Chet. And also he's, I don't know this, but he's like half American, so I mean, as if that matters to him calling himself that. And Royvus is somebody from Eternal Darkness.
Oh, right.
Somebody's called something Royvus.
Yeah, the Royvus family.
Okay. Yeah. So maybe that's Savior Backwards and that's why they're called that.
That's got Dennis Dike all over it, that as Savior Backwards.
So that is why he's called that. Yeah. It's a crank and Eternal Darkness.
Oh, wow.
Real cultural touchstones.
I mean, yeah. For certainly for this podcast, that's well within our wheelhouse. So yeah, I mean, the reason the podcast resonate with me is it felt like not many UK games journals moved into that space.
It was disproportionately US dominated. I mean, you mentioned One Up earlier and One Up, even at our office, there were people who were on the mags there, who listened to the One Up's podcast and didn't give a shit about the podcast we made internally, I imagine. Arguably, it still is a space that's dominated by US.
But I think that's part of why we found our way in. But I wondered how you felt coming into it because I thought you just had such a distinctive style of doing things. The way that Chet says, genuine, it's still burned into my brain.
How much Chet loved the game Bleed, it's still burned into my brain. His love of X-Blig more generally, just great stuff really. Talk a bit about the journey of the podcast, I guess.
Okay, let's go back to what you said about 1UP and everything. I was a big fan of 1UP, I was a big fan of Boncast, and just generally the US podcast scene. Like you said, it wasn't too much coming out of the UK, there was some of us having to do, we had to do podcasts on the MAG teams.
But it was like, okay, let's squeeze this in for 40 minutes in the middle of everything else. It didn't feel like a passion project at any point, certainly for me and my team. Also, if I was going to sit down and talk games, I didn't want to talk about them with my team.
Shout out to any of them if they're still listening. They're not the people I want to talk about games with. It would be more like, I don't want to talk with you and Chet, almost said his real name, Chet, and other people.
There was that, but yeah, I was listening to a lot of them, and I've always had this wanting to do content thing. I don't like the word content, but I mean, what else do you call it? So obviously, wanting to be a games journalist, wanting to do podcasts, wanting to do YouTube, which I've gone on to do.
It's just in me, and I'm sure that's the same for all of us. I don't know why we just want to do stuff and talk about the things that we're passionate about. That just seemed like the format at the time.
Now, quite where we got the idea for the format from, I think that was... I'm definitely going to say his real name in a minute, because I haven't called him Chet in... When did we stop the podcast?
2014. So, in over 10 years. We still speak almost daily, so this is going to be difficult.
But if it gets revealed, it gets revealed. I think that he was inspired by... Because he was a big fan of Roger Ebert and Siskel.
Gene Siskel, I think it was, their show. And he wanted to do a version of that where we filmed ourselves talking. And it was something about that structure that he had the idea for the two top ten lists or the two lists or something.
So that was his idea. The name was inspired by the stupid Michael Cera film, The Infinite Playlist. Oh, is that where it came from?
I always assumed it was something to do with that, just because it was so close to it.
I don't know. I mean, I just want... The name came from me.
I don't know why I decided to name it after a film I've not even seen. But there we go. So it just seemed to be...
Let's call... Everything else had a short name, so let's call it a really long name to stand out. But I mean, it wasn't...
There was not that much thought put into it, even that. And yeah, where is every podcast kind of fit into the same pattern, what you've been playing, news, Q&A. It just seemed like a good idea to do something different.
And because he is quite an unusual character, he didn't want to do anything that was too long. So the idea is we're going to cram it all into 40 minutes. I don't think it was ever going to 40 minutes in any single episode.
Yeah, we're going to do these two top 10 lists. We're going to be as quick as we possibly can, as brief as we possibly can, because he hated any of the idea of podcast would start, and then people would be talking about their weekend. And he's just like, why are you telling me about the fucking weekend?
Just like, go. That's just what he's like, a very impatient person. But ironically, always late.
So yeah, that was the genesis of the thing. And then it got a little bit of traction quite early, when David Turner's friend of the show of TCGS fame, and a very good friend of mine these days, tweeted it to his following, which was obviously, I think he had two, maybe 4,000 followers at the time on Twitter. But it was also like his following was very, very hardcore gaming podcast fan.
So it was like a perfect audience to be tweeted to. And I think that's where it started to get a bit of traction. It never went massive or anything, but it had a steady audience and a growing audience and a little bit of notoriety.
Obviously, you were on plenty of episodes yourself, Sam, which was great. And yeah, it was really fun to do.
Yeah, it was really, really good. I mean, it was just so distinctive. I didn't realize every episode is on YouTube till I was doing a bit of research ahead of this.
And so if I have a quiet afternoon or two coming up, I might have one on in the background. I thought it was great. And this podcast definitely wouldn't exist without it because so many of what we do ends up being alternating top 10 lists.
And I think Chet was right in identifying that's a good way to keep you on topic, but also have a lot of different talking points so you don't get bogged down in anything. And then a lot of your personality can still come out when you're doing that. So yeah, I mean, genuinely, this podcast wouldn't have happened without it.
So it's nice to get...
I know.
How challenging was it to keep up with playing 10 games each week?
It's fucking nightmare. Especially when I had, I mean, my Elliot is now 14, like I said, was a baby when we were doing that podcast. So that was very challenging, you know, with a very young child in the house.
But we would always do it. But like sometimes we were playing games for like a mobile game for like four minutes before the podcast start to do a number 10. But we were always open and honest about that as well.
So I literally played this for three minutes. But I think the listeners understood the ridiculous constraint that we put on ourselves as a guy who'd come from doing 17 issues a year of a magazine. Let's do something else that's absolutely exhausted me.
But and yeah, and Chet was always late by like 20, 30, 40 minutes. So there was that as well. But to be fair, he did all the editing.
He did. He did so much more work on it than I did because I think he was very kind and understood that I was really strung out having a kid, a little baby in the house. But because of the nature of what we were doing, especially in the early days when I was still doing working on that 360 scene, because I was, you know, I did it all.
I did like literally every review, everything. So I was always playing a lot of games all the time, as was he. So there was always like a good chunk of it was always just kind of happening naturally.
And because we allowed ourselves to continue talking about the same game week after week for a few weeks at least, so you kind of had that continuation. So it wasn't the impetus that we had to play 10 new games every single week. And it also was like relatively early in mobile games as well, where you could get through a lot of those without them being as gross as they are now at X-Blig.
So there was there was ways and means to do it, but it was hard.
I did like discover quite a lot of games through your podcast. Do you have in your head a sort of an idea of what your sort of hall of fame, Chet and John's games were? I feel like Bleed would be in there, the Velocity games would be in there.
I definitely went and played those after listening to it on your podcast. Any others come to mind? Was Mount Your Friends one of yours?
I can't remember.
That was Chet's.
Yeah, yeah, that was about it.
Mount Your Friends was Chet's. God, it's a good question. Honestly, it feels like a lifetime ago.
I should have noted it in this podcast plan and didn't. Sorry, that's quite rude really to ask that.
No, no, no, you're fine. I'm just trying to think. Yeah, I mean, Velocity is a great shout and that gave us a bit of a connection with Futurelab as well.
We've obviously gone from strength to strength these days with Powerwash. Those guys are really cool. We had a bit of a connection with those guys because of the love that we gave for the Velocity Games, which are fantastic.
I'd love for them to make another one of those. I think they've mentioned it, but honestly, it was so long ago and I can't remember. I've just done so much content since then that it's hard to remember what really stands out.
But yeah, those ones are definitely a good shout. And Bleed, yeah, the Bleed games are damn good.
Yeah.
It's such a thrill when you like a game on a podcast and then find out that someone who made that game listens to the podcast or has heard that episode and then starts sharing it with like other people at the studio or whatever. Those are like some of my favorite memories of doing this podcast. It's definitely like when someone realizes that the thing they made is like one of our sacred texts.
Yeah, so cool.
I remember you talking at the time about how neither of you fancy doing a Patreon. And it was in the early days of that kind of like fan supported sort of economy basically. Do you think you'd have taken a different approach on doing it if you made it a little bit later?
Definitely. I mean, it would be ridiculous for me to say otherwise as somebody who's been, that's my income these days and has been for like the last five years. So yeah, I mean, I'll tell you a word for it that we used to say that.
That sounds like something that we'd say, but I don't know why the hell we said that.
I think Chet said it rather than you, actually.
He's so weird. He's just got funny rules, probably just felt, you know what it's like with British people, it's very difficult. We're not brought up to sell ourselves.
It can be very awkward for us.
I saw a peer absolutely eat it on Patreon and I just thought, I will never ever do that because of that. I couldn't bear to let the public decide my value and it'd be like 20 quid. I just wouldn't be able to survive that.
Yeah.
There may have been a bit of that masked in some sort of like pretense about not wanting to do it for moral reasons. But now I think it's a beautiful way to support sort of art and creativity and content that you love. And it's just I liken it to like a high five and a handshake between an audience and a creator.
And I love supporting people on Patreon. I'm obviously been blessed to be supported on it as well over years. So definitely would have.
Yeah, definitely would have. And it probably, I mean, who knows if it would still be going, the thought of having to work for another 10 years with, I almost said his real name again, Chet, day in, day out. I mean, that sounds like hell on earth.
And I say that with love as somebody speaks to him every single day. But yeah, if we were making some bank off it, maybe we would have, maybe I could have tolerated it.
Yeah, I sort of, I liked the way that Chet's very firm rules though. Like that made him a great podcaster because I think you were a bit more laid back than he was. And he would get hit up about certain things or certain people in the industry.
But I think that quietly that was part of the appeal of the podcast, as people silently agreeing with him or just like enjoying how much he might object to something or how specifically he'd feel about something. I thought you were both great podcasters and you really complement each other really well. But yeah, the rules thing, that's just funny because I do remember being a man of rules for sure.
So yeah, it sounds like busyness is the reason you stop doing it ultimately, is that right?
I think that we just came to the point where we weren't really feeling it anymore. I think we were annoying each other. Yeah, it just wasn't gelling in the same way that it had.
It just felt like it had run its course. But like I said, I was just playing FIFA with him yesterday, so it's not like we fell out or anything. It's just one of those things that it just had its time.
But yeah, because we're still friends, we may do an episode at some point. Who knows?
That'd be cool. I do like it when every now and then you come back and do one.
Yeah, I think he also got really sick of games in the games industry, if I remember correctly. Yeah, that was another thing. He basically stopped playing any single player games for a long time and has only played Dead by Daylight for an ungodly amount of hours.
A truly ungodly amount of hours. Should you maybe go and see someone type of amount of hours.
Do you ever play rematch with Chet? Is that a thing you've tried?
Yes. He is the worst goalkeeper I've ever seen. He could not get his head around the fact that it wasn't B to dive, and it was Y.
All the triggers, he kept saying, I'll press the trigger again. It's like, dude, we played this for like 10 hours. How are you still pressing the trigger?
Anyway, yeah, we have played rematch together.
Yeah, it's funny because when that game came out, I played it and I thought if this game was around when Chet and John's is around, they would have covered it on about nine different episodes in a row. Just getting more and more into the nitty gritty of it.
That would have been correct, yes.
So around 2019, you became a YouTuber full time. What led to that? I guess we should talk about how you pivoted to music from games.
So what was the background of your passion there?
I can tell the genesis of this. So I think it was 2017. I went to EGX, still doing stuff with Monster, and went for a dinner with a friend of the show, Andrew Smith, Spilt Milk Studios, who I'm sure you guys know.
There was a bunch of other people from the industry there, who I'd not met, but I sat next to a guy called Callum, who I think worked for Raw Fury at the time. I followed him on Twitter, whatever, had a bit of a chat. And he on Twitter posted a video of a guy in his car reacting to Rage Against the Machines' first album.
Like a black American guy, never heard it before, big hip hop fan, and reacting to, and loving Rage Against the Machines' first album. And so I watched that and thought it was brilliant. And I sent that to Simon, who I know you've had on the show.
And he said, oh yeah, I've already, I maybe followed the same guy. He'd already seen it as well. So we both absolutely loved this video.
And then because of the way YouTube works, I started getting recommended other reaction videos. And most of them were like American hip hop fans reacting to heavy music, metal music, Metallica, Megadeth, et cetera. And me and him, me and Simon started sending them back and forth to each other.
Really enjoying them. And that was, yeah, I think getting out like to around Christmas time. I feel like I've jumped a few months, but it doesn't matter.
And then we just had the idea of like, wouldn't it be cool to do this? Like he lived up near London. I was still down on the South Coast and we hadn't seen each other for years.
But yeah, we just was like, well, why don't we? He said, and he had a camera, green screen, lots of experience speaking on camera. So after about six weeks of saying, should we do this?
It turns out I was doing some consultation work for a company. I don't think I can actually say who it was because you're NDA, don't you? For a company that's based near where he lived, a gaming publisher.
And so it was possible to then like drive around and go and see him at his place. And we sat down and filmed a bunch of music reaction videos. And the second one we did, which was basically titled Two Metalheads React to Hip Hop or Metalhead Reaction to Hip Hop for an artist called Logic.
And I'd had an inkling from the other videos I've been seeing on YouTube that his, that artist's fan base were just rabid for anybody reacting to his music who hadn't heard it before, and they were going to support it and share it, and it was going to get views. And yeah, overnight that video we did, which was the second one I believe we published on our channel, the third one, did like 4K views overnight, which on a fresh channel is really, really unheard of. And it brought in a ton of new people, a ton of comments asking us to do this video, and this artist, and this.
And then from starting that channel, which is called Rock Reacts, to four months later, the channel had 100,000 subscribers. It's just at the time it was the most viral channel in the UK. Wow.
Along with a guy called Nico Molana, who's now gone on to be like super, super famous. He's, I don't know if you know who that is, it's more of like a younger generation thing. But yeah, he's got millions of subscribers now.
But both he and us were like in this crazy, yeah, this crazy virality moment where I think we were doing about four million views a month getting a thousand subscribers a day. It was utterly wild. And yeah, that kept growing.
And then unfortunately, for various reasons, Simon and I decided to stop working with each other on that one. And I just went to go and do it on my own and build up from the start again on my own. Yeah, that I managed to bring over a bunch of the audience from from Rock React and build it up again.
But instead of doing songs, I was more covering albums. But it was never really an intentional pivot from games to music. It was just a format, an idea that I liked, was really enjoying watching, and then quite fancy trying myself, but never thought that it would turn into anything.
But when an opportunity like that happens and you get some bizarre growth and virality that you could never predict, even though I had an inkling that something could happen because I had seen a roadmap a little bit. But to be able to turn it into a full-time career was obviously not something that I ever really envisaged. But fast forward, what, five years from when I went solo, basically, or six years from when I went solo, and still hanging in there today.
Yeah, I knew that you and Simon had had some success out the gate, but I just, other than you meeting The Weeknd, it was when someone sent me out of nowhere your reaction to Houdini by Eminem, and not even saying, oh, it's a mate you used to work with or something. It was just someone saying, if you enjoyed listening to Houdini, you should watch this. It's quite a fun reaction video.
I was just like, wow, that's bizarre. Yeah, so it's incredibly impressive. I was wondering how the audience differs, because every now and then I look in your mentions and see that someone will just be like, react to this, do this, do that.
What is that kind of connection like with people from that, listening to that stuff?
So that's been relentless in my life for years, to the point where I think I could post a picture from a funeral of a family member, and that would be the comments that I'd be getting underneath it. But I made a decision a long time ago that I just wasn't going to respond or reply to any of those, because when I say it was relentless, it was like, at the beginning, it was thousands a day of people saying, react to this. And obviously that was great because it told us what videos to do next, but it then got a bit much.
So I still get that all the time, but I just don't respond to any of that because I can't. And because I don't, I think it's died down a little bit. But what's the audience is?
Very passionate about the artists that they love. Definitely happy to get into arguments online with fan bases of other artists, especially since the Drake and Kendrick Lamar stuff last year, which has gone into almost being a bit like Gamergate in a weird sort of way, just like people picking sides and relentlessly arguing online, and it all getting a bit political and weird. But my audience is, and the people who watch the videos is typically skews a bit younger than, it was more like the age that I was when I started games journalism.
So most of the audience is probably still in their 20s, maybe now in their early 30s. So there's a little bit of a generational disconnect there. But at the same time, I think they kind of see me as like an unk, to use the word.
So I'm definitely that. So yeah, there's a, and because of that, I can like impart some wisdom and life experience and stuff on the videos and it comes across relatively well, I think, because these are people in a different stage of their life to me. For the most part, just judging by the demographic data on the back end of YouTube as much as anything else.
But yeah, it's because at times when it's been at its most viral, the peak of Rock Reacts, when I was doing my Weeknd album reactions, Drake and Kendrick, it's so, the scale is so kind of massive and God, there are YouTubers who are a thousand times bigger than me, but it's still so many people that it's hard to really wrap your head around at times. So I kind of have to disconnect from it a little bit.
Yeah, you know, you have been phenomenally successful. You have over half a million subscribers and you've got an amazing, like you were one of the first people to support our patrons. I immediately supported your patron in return and I see how hard you work on there.
You know, it seems like only hard work and endurance gets you that sort of following. Is there any other secret to it?
Yeah, I saw that in the pre-show questions that you sent across or whatever you want to call them and I was like, oh, that's a good question. Because I don't think you can make it happen without that, just as like you couldn't make Back Page happen without that or anything else. But I do think that that is a trap that people fall into a little bit, where they'll relentlessly, I mean, some people work so, so, so hard.
They produce so much content. They do so many videos and they just go absolutely nowhere because there's no format, there's no angle, there's no curiosity that they're building up. Just as the same ways we do with cover lines back in the day.
You know, you had to actually like provoke a bit of curiosity, a lot of curiosity, in a potential watcher, or actually a returning watcher, where so many people fall down is unlike, you know, writing takes its time and, you know, as someone who do podcasts, they take their time, but video making is by far the most time intensive ones of all of the, you know, standard content types, I would say, especially if you're going to do something that's really high production, a video essay or something along those lines. You've got to script it, speak the whole thing, edit it, get B-roll, do, you know, it takes, it can take hours and hours and hours and hours and hours to do a single video. And if that bombs, that's incredibly demoralizing for people.
So I think one of the issues that people run into is they want to create because they're extremely passionate, and maybe they want to do something like a video essay, and they maybe study some channels that tell you how to do it and understanding viewer retention and this and that. But they put so much time into each individual thing and it doesn't go anywhere that they become demoralized and stop. And in truth, there are ways of getting through that initial huge nebulous mess that is sub 1000 subscriber YouTube.
There's a way of kind of breaking out of that relatively, not relatively easily, but without having to work yourself to the absolute bone just by understanding what an audience might want from somebody who doesn't have a following yet. For example, Metalheads react to hip hop. Okay, well, that's interesting.
I wonder what these guys think about this. And then you have a bunch of stuff going on that's very appealing. Like watching somebody react to music is just almost always appealing.
There's something about it. There's something about mirror neurons of watching someone else nod their head to music that you like that becomes very watchable. So there's just ways of breaking through that without having to kill yourself.
But at the same time, like we did a hell of a lot of work to get Rock Reacts going. And I've done a hell of a lot of work to get what I was doing. But I also did a hell of a lot of work doing over 100 videos for a gaming YouTube channel that went absolutely fucking nowhere because I wasn't understanding these concepts and principles that I've gone on to understand later, which by no means are a guarantee, but they give you a bit of a chance, you know?
I had a question about just the nuts and bolts of a react to music video. How naturally do those reactions come to you? Because there's like a real performance element to it.
Like I watch your videos and I think, oh, I'm too self-conscious to lose myself in something like that and to film it and allow myself to be captured in that moment. Like I would sit there just dead still listening. Did that come naturally in the beginning?
Or do you feel like you've had to like learn that style or your style?
It's a great question. I think the answer is probably both. I think the fact that I had somebody else to do the videos with at the beginning really helped.
So I would say I'm not like the most super expressive person in all life, but music's always physically moved me. So I kind of knew that, you know, when there's a heavy drop in a metal song or a really amazing hip hop beat, there's something's going to happen. Like something's going to happen to my face.
Something's going to happen to my body that I'm kind of not really in control of. So that was always going to be there. But, you know, I worked with somebody at the beginning in Simon, who was so much more experienced in talking to camera, so much more experienced in YouTube and all that sort of stuff.
So it was much easier to have someone to kind of bounce off of at the beginning. And I think we made close to a thousand videos on Rob Reacts. So that's a lot of reps.
So by the time it was time to do it myself, actually, the first few videos on the channel, people were commenting, oh, this feels a bit like he's trying too hard. I've had a few of those comments on some of the early videos. And I think they were right, because it was suddenly different to do it on my own.
But I have learned over time to sit and be a bit more natural and chat in a more casual way, I guess, to the camera. It takes time. But I'd probably fire the question back at you.
Like, did you think that you would feel as unselfconscious as you probably feel now doing this compared to the beginning?
Yeah, I mean, this is what I feel OK about voice. It's second, there's like a camera element and like the face comes into it because Oh, God, yeah. The reason we don't, you know, everyone's talking about, you know, video podcasts and you should really be represented as a video podcast.
But my head genuinely is inside this weird, like, overturned coffee table, sound padded thing that I've created. And if we filmed ourselves, that's what you'd see of me. You'd see my body disappearing into a coffee table.
Sorry, what? You're inside a coffee table?
Yeah, yeah, it's quite budget. My house is really ecky. And the only thing that I can, that makes this podcast work is, yeah, there's like a coffee table I flipped on its side and lined with the pillows for our sofa, which has got my mic in it.
And then I stick my head in that.
It's amazing.
I'm just at a desk, you know.
And it might be a hook for a video podcast. Like you get to see Sam's face and my body and this table.
Well, but that's my worry is more just the appearance thing of being like a comment that will go, you know, I didn't know that the fat hairy bikers had A, shaved and B, launched a video game channel. That's like the sort of thing that if I saw that would dismantle me bit by bit. So I'm sort of relieved that we're audio only, you know, it can sort of hide a little bit in plain sight.
So, yeah.
Yeah, I just couldn't deal with it. I think it's because when I worked at Yogscast, like they used to be, you know, I'd be picked up on the office webcam occasionally, which would be streaming to all these teenagers. And there'd be all these teenagers just writing horrible things about me in real time, about how much like X member of Yogscast put on weight or whatever, and you'd be like, oh, for fuck's sake.
So I think it's a hangover from that. That's why I can't react to Randy Newman music videos. Oh, dear.
Reacting to Yoko Shimomura going mental on a piano, Matthew. That's what like your version of that would be.
Do you ever do video game music, Jon?
No, weirdly. I've never done video game music, but I saw some people do reactions to the Claire Obscure soundtrack and do millions of views. I'm like, I'm a fucking idiot.
I mean, for the things that I should have been doing, that would have been one of them. But no, I've never actually done that. Yeah, it's been so hip hop and then pop focus just because that's where the audience came from and that's what they drive.
So yeah, but I stepped outside of that boundary a few times and had success as well.
Do you ever miss being part of a team, Jon? I mean, it's, yeah. Because I would imagine, that's the one thing that stopped me from being freelance.
I like working in PR as well, but I just like bothering other people. And I definitely saw you as a team player when we were imagine.
No, I do, mate. Yeah, this is probably, in many ways, the hardest job I've ever done just because it is so solitary. And if I didn't have Jiu Jitsu to go to where, they're maybe four or five times a week in a group of people that I know very well, and can go and have like that camaraderie with.
And it's not the same as being in an office with people all the time, but it has elements of it. There's a community element to it. Without that, I think I'd go absolutely loopy.
So, yeah, definitely. One of the things when I was doing this and working a monster still was the fact that every couple of weeks, I'd be up in the office, I'd be seeing people. And even though it was a pain in the ass to go and drive all the way up to like this weird little town at the edge of London, which had nothing else in it apart from the office.
Now I don't do that. There's no real reason quite often for me to go anywhere. And yeah, I think this is actually one of the main reasons that YouTubers or content creators in general do burn out and do find it really difficult because you don't have any of those normal social dynamics.
I'm fortunate that I'm married and have kids, so there's people in the house. But yeah, I do miss that banter. That's why I listen to a lot of podcasts, a lot of podcasts where there's people in there watching a lot of like football post reactions, where there's people chatting to each other just to have that kind of feeling, you know?
So yeah, my ideal situation would probably be to have some sort of space that I could go to and work with people like they used to work, you know, like people that we used to work with, and you probably still do work with, like-minded people, but also not have to. That was the thing. If I didn't have to go to the office every single day, I found it quite exhausting to be having to get up at the same time and be in a place and be there for a fixed amount of hours.
I don't think I could go back to that now, but yeah, there's definitely a kind of loneliness to it. There's no two ways about it.
Yeah, I definitely sort of, I've kind of gone through different versions of this because I, you know, I've worked in a job where people go in like one or two days a week, and that ends up being the sweet spot where you can socialize, you can go to the pub at lunchtime and then kind of get a load of work done. And then the other day is just a bit, you know, a little bit more head down, which is absolutely fine. And yeah, I think going into editorial, imagine being my first ever job, I've just always been a bit like, oh, I just want, you know, I want that to be part of my work life mix.
And Matthew, what you do now, I think you, a big part of your enjoyment of your job is tied up in the fact that it has a bit of an editorial at future vibe to it. There's a bunch of people who work there, and I think that's like a key thing for you, isn't it? You know, you like bothering people.
Yeah, just, yeah, just talking bullshit all day and absolute nonsense. And everyone like playing a little bit of a character and leaning into those roles. Yes, it's just, it is really, really like future, actually.
A huge perk of the job, the main perk for me, really.
Yeah, but as a, you know, the way the works changed over the last few years, not many places like that really exist anymore. So, you know, it's certainly not as straightforward to get into as it was when, you know, we were Star Friars or whatever. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to hear your perspective on that, John.
I mean, at the same time, you know, you are better known to, you know, people now than you ever were as a games journalist. And I guess I do have to ask, I know you've talked about meeting The Weeknd, I think that was on TCGS, you talked about that last year or the year before. And you've been asked about that plenty, but I did want to ask about being on the radar of different, of other musicians.
Was that a turning point for you, meeting Abel and, you know, that sort of, that moment being like a big thing?
It was very, very, very strange and surreal in a way that it's still kind of hard to wrap my head around. Obviously, in the time, like Matt was just talking about, about game developers who'd be, you know, they'd learn that you were talking about them on the podcast, or that it's a sacred text, and then they'd share it. That was, you know, such a wonderful feeling in gaming podcasts.
In a similar way, like having my reactions shared or reposted by various artists has been really cool, you know. Suddenly, loads of people are hitting me up that, JIDs reposted you or whatever. Yeah, the moment, I don't know, I might as well tell the story, the moment where I do this move on the, on the videos where there's a piece of music that I really like, and I will slowly put my sunglasses on, which came, I just did that organically once on a Rock Reacts video, while listening to Frank Ocean, I believe it was, and then it just became like this signature thing, and then The Weeknd himself did the exact same move on stage at Coachella.
So loads of people send it to me, and I didn't think anything of it, I didn't think he was doing it because of me, and I still don't, but I tweeted that picture and just say, Able to say you're a fan, and then I went to Jiu Jitsu and didn't think anything of it, I knew I'd get a bunch of likes from people who follow me. Come back, and then he's retweeted me saying that with a picture of the sunglasses emoji, like the actual Weeknd who has 70 million followers, and I was just like, all the blood just drained out of my face, it's just like, what the fuck? I was just like, holy shit, this is insane.
I was like, okay, well, this is the moment. Immediately DM him, he's got there, like I said, 77 million followers on Instagram. He's never going to see it, but you've got to do it.
Just DM him. I was like, wow, thanks for sharing, obviously, massive fan. I can't remember what I said, just some generic shit.
Within five minutes, he'd replied and started having conversation with me, and I was like, this is just the fucking weirdest thing that ever happened. He was shortly about to tour in Europe, so he invited me and Nat to a show, to the London show. We went to that as his guests, but we didn't meet him at that show, but we had amazing seats, amazing access right by the stage.
And I made a video about that whole experience and talking to him, and why it's so important to step out of your comfort zone in life. Because like you were saying, Matthew, I was not comfortable with the idea of being on camera. Really, it was like I liked the idea of doing audio, I liked the idea of writing.
But even when we used to do video stuff back at Imagine and commentary stuff, I didn't want to do any of that stuff, I just wanted to write back then. I'm not sure why, but I felt like that. I don't know if I was actually telling the truth at the time, or lying to myself and trying to protect myself, I don't know.
But regardless, it was not something that I ever really saw myself doing. Then to go out and do it on my own again after Rock Reacts ended. I just always encourage the audience to, without trying to sound too cliche, just to chase your dreams and to really step outside their comfort zone and do that thing that might feel uncomfortable that you really want to do.
That was the message of that video. I think because of that, more so than anything I'd spoken about The Weeknd himself, he shared that video and said that I think he said, I think I can speak for everyone when we say we really thank you for stepping outside of your comfort zone or something along those lines. I was just like, this is just getting weirder and weirder.
So I messaged him again saying thank you and he said, just absolutely loved the video. Yeah, I really want to meet you guys. Can you come to another show and we can come and have some coffee and chop it up.
And I was like, fuck, and I looked at all the other shows that were happening in Europe at the time. And yeah, it was possible for us to go to the Paris show and get the kids looked after. And yeah, we hopped on a plane, went to the Paris show, and then, yeah, got taken backstage before his show, sat with him for like 30 minutes in his sofas, saw his mask and everything.
And yeah, just chatted and he is like insanely nice. Nicer than most regular people that you just meet. You'd be like, oh, that is a real nice guy.
Like Christian Donnan, that's a really, really fucking cool guy.
The Weeknd is nicer than Christian Donnan.
He's not nicer than Christian Donnan, come on now. You can't write that music and be nicer than Christian Donnan.
Is that the only time in reality anyone will ever make that comparison between those two men? Like I, surely, surely.
A hundred percent, but it shouldn't be, but it is true. But yeah, like it's just an exceptionally pleasant and fun conversation about, yeah, we talked about the various stadiums that he was playing in. He was asking my opinions on different football stadiums and whether they're worth playing.
Could you imagine that being a question? You ask someone, should I play at this, should I play in front of 90,000 at this stadium? Is this a good stadium to sing at?
Anyway, yeah, he was telling us some stories about hanging out with the robots, as he called them, which I then, I was like, the robots? And he went, you know, Daft Punk. I was like, oh yeah, the robots.
Yeah, of course. And then he like volunteered to make a little like 10 second video for the kids. Just, oh, you know, give me a phone and I'll do a video for the kids.
And then obviously took some photos and videos with him, which have gone super viral, me doing the sunglasses move with him, because I had this vision. As soon as all this started happening, I had this vision of doing the sunglasses move with him, with Abel himself. And then, yeah, he was more than up for doing that.
And yeah, he told me, I don't know if it's true, he told me he did that at Coachella because he was a big fan of my videos. I don't know if he was just saying that to be nice or not, because I actually got that move from Scotty to Hotty from WWE.
So I think he did as well, because I know he's a wrestling fan from back in the day. But the coolest thing about him is not the coolest thing about him, but the coolest thing about our relationship, I guess you call it that, is he's a massive gamer, like massive gamer. So at the time, I knew he'd been playing Tears of the Kingdom when I met him and he had his Switch sitting on the table in front of us where we were sitting.
So I just took the conversation there because it's like, well, it's me. What else am I going to talk about? So yeah, we chatted for a good 10, 15 minutes about Tears of the Kingdom and about different Switch games.
Then since then, me and him had just gone back and forth about games a bunch of times. I recommended him Disco Elysium and yeah, he said he was definitely going to play it. He said it looked amazing.
But then he played The Plucky Squire and I'm like, man, what a choice. That couldn't be much different. And yeah, we chatted to each other a little bit about the Switch too.
And then, yeah, I've not spoken to him for a few weeks. He's not somebody I want to bother too often. But isn't it weird what can happen when you just put yourself out there on the Internet?
Yeah, it's a great trip and amazing story. But it's not watching me eat a sandwich in New York, is it, Jon? Let's face it.
Is it a sandwich or a bagel?
A bagel. I got that detail wrong. Yeah.
Yeah, so it was amazing to see. I was like, wow, I mean, well done. Well done to him for, you know, sort of creating this career.
I thought you meant well done to The Weeknd for meeting Jon. That's very kind of you.
No, just, you know, I saw it go viral. People I knew saw it go viral and mentioned it to me. I was like, well, you know, congratulations.
That's amazing. But I imagine after that, that probably took you to a new level of fame. So do you now get a lot more attention from artists?
Is that something that's changed as a result of that?
Honestly, it felt like kind of a, in a weird sort of way, it felt like a kind of closing of a chapter more than taking me to another level. It's just like the channel, my channel on its own grew massively when I started reacting to his music and I loved it so much. I had not heard it before and his fans were so kind coming on board and sharing and supporting on the Patreon and allowing me to do this full time, especially when I, you know, the monster stuff ended about a week before COVID.
So I decided to go full time, stop things with Monster Energy after eight years and then a week later COVID happened and they got rid of all their freelancers because they had to anyway. So that would have ended then. And so Patreon allowed me to do this full time and a lot of those people in the early days were The Weeknd fans.
So just to then go and meet him and have that moment with him and that connection, it just felt like it was kind of a full circle moment. And it's been a little bit weird since because it was such a pinnacle that I sort of in a strange situation where I've got two paths to go down. One is to go to another level on YouTube.
And I think to do that, you have to really get out of your get out of the house. To be honest, you really have to get out of the house and start doing big collabs and doing big things and really trying to push it to the next level. And that's not really something that I'm interested in doing to become another Mr. Beast or something like, you know, me, you've known me a long time, Samuel.
I don't want to be going out and doing all that stuff. I like just chilling in the house. So yeah, for the last like since that happened like two years ago now, it's been a bit strange because in some ways, I probably am more known and it was amazing.
The people that have seen videos and I'm friends with Dynamo, you know the musician? Not the musician, the magician. Yeah.
He's a big fan of my videos and we chat like, what? I love that guy. I've loved that guy since he first started doing magic.
Isn't he like the most famous magician pretty much?
I mean, apart from David Blaine. Yeah, probably. Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah. I mean, it's just bizarre, but it just goes to show every single one under those videos. You don't know who it is.
It's a cliché that people say, and they say it to make people feel better when they get three views on their video, but it's true. You don't know who they are, and every single one can be anybody.
I wish we had a famous listener. Just one.
You do, me.
Oh, of course. Sorry. I wish we had a second one.
Glenn Moyes on the telly. That's two. That's all right, isn't it?
Yeah, that's really interesting to hear. I'm glad that you're doing it your way. I definitely associate you as someone who likes to hang out, but also someone who likes to just spend a weekend playing through a game or whatever, and let's say chilling.
So it's kind of an interesting balance to thread when you're working in that space. This was kind of a frivolous question I threw in here really, but I was going to ask what your top five Lana Del Rey albums were, Jon. I saw her live at Cardiff early this year, and it was a city full of teenage girls wearing white dresses, who would be incredibly unimpressed seeing me in that stadium among them.
It was like Picnic at Hanging Rock, basically, the Peter Weir film. And then there was just me in the crowd, nestled amongst all these teenagers. Just like...
Captain Jack from another Peter Weir film.
So yes, what are your top five Lana Del Rey albums, Jon, off the top of your head?
How many has she got? She's only got like seven, isn't she? That's quite hard.
I would say I'll do a top three for you in no particular order because I haven't thought about this. But yeah, Ultraviolence is probably my favorite. I would say Norman Rockwell and then Did You Know There's a Tunnel would probably be my three favorites.
Yeah, Norman Rockwell being my number one. Ultraviolence, I feel like, was one that people didn't like at the time and now has a bit of that sort of cult rep going on. It seems to be the journey of that one.
But I was watching your reactions and it was funny seeing the comments of people genuinely enjoying the sort of religious experience you had listening to those albums one by one. This is cool seeing this art form you're working in, super interesting.
Did you know that she follows me on TikTok? How weird is that? She follows like nine people and I'm one of them, why?
So it's like you, her like crocodile wrestler husband or whatever he does, and seven other people. That is wild.
Amazing.
Yeah, that is strange. But yeah, that was interesting as well because you were talking about how The Weeknd's fan base, there's some crossover there. Oh yeah, usually.
Well, that's the reason that I started doing her music is because obviously she's done songs with him. And then, yeah, so many of those people were encouraging me to listen to hers. And I knew the video game song and I didn't really like it back then, to be honest.
And I was like, okay, I mean, I guess I can do that. But yeah, the rest is history. It was fantastic to do those records.
And I kind of miss, I don't really have the opportunity now to do these like classic albums that mean so much to people because I kind of done them all. So when I was talking about the full circle moment, I'm more just covering new stuff that comes out, which is fine, but I feel like there was a real moment there for a few years where we're doing some magic. But that's why I'm working more on helping other people do their, grow their channels and grow their things as well.
It's more into that. I feel like I'm in that chapter of my life now. So it's a funny thing.
And I do miss games as well, to be honest. So maybe some sort of comeback there.
Yeah. I mean, I know you've made videos about anime as well, for example, which is quite different as well. But I did want to ask what you've been playing lately.
Have you played anything good? I feel like games are a huge part of your life, like you say.
Yes. I'm playing FIFA at the moment. At the beginning of every FIFA, I always do Ultimate Team for about three weeks until loads of cards with loads of colours come on.
I don't understand how to get them. So I just stop playing. That's been the last five years I've done that.
It's quite good this year. But that's not something I'm going to speak about at length. Silksong is really hard.
I've probably done about 10, I think my clock says 20, but about 10 hours of Hollow Knight Silksong, but it's incredibly difficult at 43 years old. The reaction speed does go. You wish that it didn't, but there's a reason old people drive that slowly, and I know it's coming, it just is.
Watching my son play Fortnite or whatever else he's playing is, I'm like, what the hell is happening? So the hands are slowing down a little bit. I think the last great game that I loved, that I played this year was, let me get the name right, is it Sword of the Sea?
Is that what it's called? The one from Giant Squid.
Oh yeah, yeah, it's a journey-ish one.
Yes, yeah, yeah. I absolutely love that. Stunning visually, incredibly emotive, just beautiful game.
Amazing to, like an amazing feeling game. Ended a little bit abruptly for me. I feel like it was going to like, into like 10, 10-ish season, but yeah, it just ended a little abruptly.
Perhaps not quite as good as The Pathless, which is a game I don't feel that many people have played. I feel like a lot of people did Abzu and quite a lot of people are speaking about this new one and obviously The Journey, but The Pathless. I preferred that.
That was my favorite PS5 launch game. Earlier this year, I played Mouthwashing, which was really interesting. I don't know if you played that one.
Yeah, I have loved it.
Yeah, that was fantastic. I think that's about it, really, in terms of games that I've been playing recently.
Really good music in sort of the sea as well.
Yeah, everything about it was just fantastic.
It would be funny if you did do a reaction to the Clear Upskill soundtrack, because it's so not your kind of game of what I associate with the kind of games you're interested in. I don't think you're ever a big Japanese RPG guy.
No, but I have done about 10 hours of Clear Upskill and I was enjoying it, to be honest. I thought it was really quite cool. Some of the music was interesting, definitely.
But it was one of those ones I stopped playing for a couple of weeks, went back to. The battle was quite hard. I kept dying and I was just like, yeah, this isn't going to happen, is it, Jon?
Yeah, I like the characters and the writing, the opening scene where, you know, I don't want to spoil it if anybody's not played it. I'm sure most people have. But, you know, the opening really powerful, emotive early scene in the game, cut scene was, that got me, dude, like probably.
So, yeah, you know, like you said earlier, I tried to get my arms around everything. Even if it's in a genre that I'm not typically that into. Like I've tried, you know, even Persona 5 and things like that.
JRPGs have always been something that I've struggled with. But I'll give anything a go, definitely.
Yeah, I could see the countering stuff in Claire Biscule speaking to you, actually. Speaking to your action game, beat him up sensibility.
Big time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's awesome, Jon. I mean, those are my questions.
And I'm really grateful you took two hours for this, you know. So thanks so much for coming on. It's really appreciated.
Oh, it's so fun. Absolute pleasure.
Yeah, yeah. Where can people, I mean, I imagine a lot of people can find you quite easily just typing Jon Denton and you come up on Google. But where can people find you on social media?
Yeah, it's just Jon Denton. Like you say, Jon, if you type that into YouTube, you'll find me. If you type that into Twitter slash X, you'll find me on there if you'd like to on Instagram as well.
But yeah, if you just type it anywhere, it seems to come up, which is weird. It used to be a guy played college football, but I fucking beat him now. I'm more famous than that guy.
So fuck that guy. So yeah, I'm the number one now. I'm the captain now.
I'm steadily overtaking the USS Samuel B. Roberts. That Navy ship, it's me versus a boat basically.
So I feel you're a struggle there. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am MrBazzlePesto on Twitter. Oh, no, on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
Yep. And I'm Samuel W. Roberts.
And both of those, we are patreon.com/backpagepod. If you'd like to support us, we'll probably owe Chet and John some royalties, to be honest, from all the content we've pilfered from them over the years. But you can support us there if you want to get two extra podcasts a month.

Goodbye.
Goodbye. Bye.
Okay, so something I forgot to ask during the episode, and I asked right at the beginning of this recording, is how did you and Matthew meet? Because you both seem pretty determined that you've met before, but you couldn't remember where. Jon, you don't remember, right?
I definitely don't remember. I'm 98% sure we've met. Obviously, we've been in similar circles for years, and I've listened to this podcast since the onset, but you seem to think that you can remember.
Well, I do, but it's incredibly self-serving. You're the only person I remember from the evening I won my two Games Media Awards. You came up to me, and I'm absolutely sure this was you, because when I got one of the awards, I thanked all the underappreciated people who don't get nominated for awards on magazines, like the art team and the production editors or whatever, and I remember you specifically coming up to me and saying, oh, it was good that you gave those people a shout out, and that's like my memory from that evening, is that.
So apart from winning it, of course, which was obviously great.
Was that the one that was in like the big sort of ball area? I don't know what to call it.
It was in like quite a nice hotel in Central London. It wasn't a big ballroom. It was hosted by a comedian, Holly.
I want to say Holly someone.
That was the most drunk I've ever got. So that's why I don't remember meeting you. That does sound like something that I would say because I wouldn't have come up to you and gone, oh, that's like, shout out in your face.
But I would definitely would have said that it was cool that you shouted out those people.
But yeah, we lost. You must have been not on Monster, but working with Monster of a time.
Well, I was nominated. Chet and Jodz was nominated for Best Podcast, but we lost. Yeah.
We lost to somebody that wasn't my enemy. So I decided to drink all of the free wine that was on the table and got that's the most drunk I've ever been. It's horrendous.
Yeah, the next day, I woke up feeling like I'd had some sort of heart attack. And then I left my hired suit on the train. Oh, it was a whole disaster.
But you see, I thought I'd just been recognized by a real enthusiastic pair.
I don't remember it, but it definitely, you know, the energy was real. Well, that is a perfect note to wrap up on, to be honest. A story one of you remembers kind of fondly and the other one doesn't remember at all.
That's perfect.
