Rise and shine, Back Pagers. Rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply that you have been sleeping on the pod.
And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until... Well, let's just say the series has come to an end. The right podcast in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.
So wake up, Back Pagers. Wake up and smell the ashes.
Hello, everyone, and welcome to this sixth and final episode of PC Gaming Classics, AKA The Backer Page Podcast. I am Phil Ivanyukhan. With me, as always, is Jeremy Peele, the Alex Turner of Games Journalism.
Hello, Jeremy.
Hello, Phil. Hello, everyone.
Do you think I've made that happen yet? I'm doing well, yeah. I haven't seen or heard anyone else call you the Alex Turner of Games Journalism yet, but...
No, but...
Sometimes you have to sow a lot of seeds.
Through sheer force of will. I saw a photo of the Charlatans from the 90s yesterday.
Oh, yeah.
And I don't know which member of the Charlatans it was, but they looked the spit of Alex Turner on one of those old album covers. Really? And it made me wonder whether he's like, he's an immortal musician and he's just kind of pops up surreptitiously in important groups throughout the ages.
He's like the Count of Saint-Germain, Saint-Germain.
Have you heard that legend? The Wandering Jew as well as the, you know, Cain from Command and Conquer, he's probably based on the legend of the Wandering Jew. I can't remember whether it's conflated with or it's the same myth, but there's a guy who mocked Jesus as he was walking to his crucifixion and got cursed to walk the earth forever.
And so there's like a suggestion that Cain, you know, the villain of C&C, is this guy who's existed forever.
Yeah. And that would also explain a lot of Cain from WWE and his lineages as well, wouldn't it?
Yeah, same guy.
Because I think, yeah. They're all, and Citizen Cain, I think he was the father of The Undertaker and Cain, wasn't he?
Yeah.
From the movie, so.
Does Citizen Cain have hair or is it consistent that Cain's don't have hair?
I can't remember. He's got a little bit, but then I can't remember. Was Citizen Cain wearing the mask as well?
Did he come out?
I can't, yeah.
Don't remember.
We've moved on from the question, what is the Citizen Cain of games to, did Citizen Cain have hair?
And did he father WWE's Cain? I think, wasn't, I don't know how up you are on WWE. I mean, we're doing a games podcast, so it's extraordinary that wrestling's only come up now.
I think Paul Barrow was supposed to be both Cain and Undertaker's father.
Right.
See, this is, yeah. And at one point-
It's an interesting family dinner, isn't it?
Yes. My former editor on official PlayStation mag, Ben Wilson, hello Ben on the off chance that you're listening, amazing editor, amazing writer, great guy. He's got a book out which everyone should read called A Year Without Social Media or My Year Without Social Media.
But anyway, he was super into it and I'm sure he showed us a video once.
This is going to go contrary to everything I've just said about him.
It was a video from WWE of like a woman giving birth to a hand, just a hand, like from the Adams family, just like a sentient hand.
Right.
And that had something to do with, I think that had something to do with Kane's family tree. We've gone massively off topic.
This is, this is the final episode.
I wanted it to be like a big marquee, like da, da, da, da, da. Because yeah, this brings our run of 90s PC gaming classics to a close. It's the big one, Jeremy.
It's Half-Life Vs Quake.
Yes. I mean, these, what we've done here is we've set this up as a kind of a versus, right? That each of us is gonna take on the, represent the honor of one of these games.
The truth being that we both love both of these games deeply.
Absolutely. I think, you know, sometimes we've gone a little bit into the weeds in this series, particularly with Jurassic Park Trespasser, but this is like, I guess we just didn't want to like retread old ground too much and like really go into, I think sometimes you get a better sort of recollection of the era and representation of the era just by going off the beaten path a little bit. But like, given the opportunity to talk about 90s games for six episodes, like we couldn't not mention these games because they're both very dear to both of our hearts.
So.
Yeah. And there's something about it being a bit of a fight. It brings a little sort of the urgency and panic that forces you to focus down on what makes something really good.
Yeah. And I'm probably just going to talk about atmosphere like I always do. Maybe that's why I've leaned so hard on.
I've made so many top fives. I've tried to quantify. So we should say at this point as well that Jeremy, you are the John Romero of this episode.
You are Mr. Quake. Yeah. And me, I'm on team Half-Life.
Yeah. And in order to get across how good Half-Life is, I've made all the top fives in the whole world. Maybe I've just been making YouTube listicles too long and I can't put my thoughts down unless it's in list format.
But yeah, so the structure is going to be a bit different. Is I guess what we're saying. So when we get into it, we're going to first focus on Quake.
We'll do it chronologically. Jeremy's going to make the case for Quake. It's going to be a very easy case to make because I absolutely love it.
And we've played it together in co-op. Nightdive's excellent remaster of it makes co-op pretty effortless. Shout out to Nightdive.
Just my favorite entity in the world. Forget even game devs or companies. They're just my favorite thing.
So that's how it's going to work. But before we do all that, how are you, Jeremy? What's new?
What have you been up to since we last made a podcast together?
I'm good. I've been, I took a bit of time out of work. Had my brother's wedding, which was in France.
And...
Congratulations to Mr. Peel.
Yes, Duncan Peel.
Is he a younger Peel or an older Peel?
He's younger by three years. Yeah. And that was lovely.
Oh, and many, many congratulations to both of them.
Yeah. And now I'm back. We were talking about this just prior to recording, weren't we?
Like the buildup to a big review. So I've signed up to review Redfall, but there's always that mystery period where you're not sure when the code's gonna come in exactly. And from the moment you sort of signed up to it, everything else you do is sort of a decision made to try and tee up that moment when the code comes in and you've gotta hit the ground running with it.
So yeah, everything I'm doing, every decision I'm making with work right now is about, okay, what can I fit around this sort of black box period where Redfall gets reviewed?
Basically reviews are just a massive stress, aren't they? And this is what we were talking about offline. Like it takes so much more time to do a review obviously than it would to do the average feature.
It's so stressful because if you get it wrong, well, getting it wrong is quite a loaded way to say it, but if your score is like way off, then everyone will go on the Metacrick and they will hunt you down. If they love it and you hate it, they'll hunt you down. They'll make your life a misery.
If you love it and they hate it, the same thing will happen and I worry that, will I ever work again if I've got something slightly wrong? I've given it a seven and everyone else has given it sixes. I'm done.
And it just, it takes ages. You're like, have I put enough time into it? Sometimes you just, you can't finish a game or it's an online game, so there's no end point.
You're like, have I put the hours in? And I remember one game, which I won't go into the details of for obvious reasons, but the developers or the publishers came back after I'd reviewed it. And so we just wanted to check that the writer has actually accessed the end game content for this at the 300 hour mark.
And I was like, no, I haven't. I haven't put 300 hours into this game, funnily enough.
And I think you know I haven't.
Yeah, exactly. They wanted like, they just wanted to build an argument as to why I was wrong. And it was that I hadn't seen absolutely, it was an MMO, right?
Like I haven't put 300 hours into, I don't know if there were 300 hours available. Anyway, it's just always a massive stress. And I think the only reason we do it as writers is because there's a bit of prestige to reviews, probably from a bygone era where pre-YouTube, slapping the score on something was like a super, a super privileged position that, you know, played quite a big part in how that game performed.
And that's probably the bits that we paid the most attention to in games journalism when we were younger.
Yeah.
So we just, we put up with all the stress because we want to be, we want to emulate our reviewing heroes from bygone years. And interestingly, I'm just realizing that there'll be a nice bit of like a circularity there because I, Half-Life was the first review that I ever, that I ever read and I'll be referencing that later on. So there's a nice, nice bit of a rubberess to this.
Yeah. You're right. There's some kind of, the flip side of that prestige is that now reviews aren't the most read things on game sites by a long way, usually.
Like if you think of it from like the perspective of Google, well, reviews are the time where every site puts out an article that is called Dead Island 2 Review. Like good luck getting that to the top of Google. You know, it's automatically gonna be one of the biggest sites and you're sort of giving away all your potential advantages in terms of angling something cleverly, using the right words.
And it's as a result of that, like most reviews are not the, they don't match the sort of the way that we build them up in our heads as writers. It's like the most, oh, this is a really important bit of writing for me, but it might be like the least read thing you write that month potentially.
Like sometimes that happens. I guess it's just the way that we interact with websites, right? Like there are only a few websites that I would still just habitually go on.
Like I would type in eurogamer.net, for example, and just look at what's on Eurogamer. And like in my mind, I've allocated, I'm going to spend 20 minutes just reading Eurogamer today. Most people aren't doing that anymore.
That's why, you know, and it's that model that online reviews are based on. Like when, you know, when sites like RPS were first established, it was, you know, it's a blog sort of model, right? So that you would just, you're like, oh, they, you know, Sean Walker, Kieran Gill and Jim Moss and all have gone off and done this thing that's very exciting.
I'm just going to see what they're thinking at a given point. And like each day I'm going to go on there. And so when a review drops, like, oh, it's what RPS thinks about this game.
Brilliant. The traffic's already there. The community is already there.
They're going to click on the thing. People just don't really, you know, cracked.com was another great example of a site that sadly really fell victim. And I think they've sort of said this themselves.
That's not me throwing shade at cracked. But, you know, they were built around that idea, that way of using the Internet, that you would just you would type in the home page's URL and see what was going on there. And even in the early days of Facebook, when, you know, sites were driving a lot of their traffic through Facebook links, people would still do that.
And now you just really don't. Now it's very info first. So, you know, an access via a search engine or, well, yeah, basically just a search engine.
Or if you really want someone's opinion in particular, you're probably going to, you know, an influencer of some description. So in conclusion, reviews are very hard work. And that's quite a ramp about that.
Yeah. And as a freelancer, I tend to pick like two or three games a year that I'm going to review rather than kind of lean on them as like the backbone of my work. Because it's, I think I would find that very stressful and very hard to make work financially to just do reviews all the time.
They're just so time intensive and labor intensive. They're hard work.
Absolutely. Imagine if you were known as like the JRPG expert and all you did was reviews and guides.
Yeah.
Imagine how difficult that job is. I can't think of who that would be. There obviously are JRPG experts out there.
They must work like a hundred hour weeks. And like the commission to hours put in ratio must, yeah. The maths don't quite line up.
Whereas if you're like a walk, if there was like a new walking sim every week, then happy days, you know, mate. So that's tough anyway. But what we should also say is that since we last made a podcast, two very important seismic changes have happened to The Back Page podcast as a whole.
The Parent podcast run by Samuel and Matthew are overlords, surrogate parents and I'd like to think friends. They have started releasing these episodes that we're making to the normies, the general public. So if you're one of the normies listening to this in the future, then hello, we absolutely love that you're listening to this.
This is great. This podcast was originally sort of commissioned as a treat for Patreon backers and now it's going out to the general public, which is wonderful. I hope everybody is happy with what we've made.
And number two is that The Back Page is now, at the time that we're recording this, the number one gaming podcast in Apple's podcast charts, which is absolutely extraordinary.
That's in the UK, right? It's not worldwide, but it's still there.
Well, don't bog down in details, Jeremy. It's the number one. I think it's just the number one thing that's being consumed globally.
Like, forget digital media or anything. People are listening to The Back Page podcast more than they're buying milk right now. That's an extraordinary achievement.
And many congratulations to Samuel and Matthew for what they've built. Listen, is it down to us? And the fact that they...
I think it happened by literally by coincidence the same week that the first episode of PC Gaming Classics went live to the public.
Word was out and The Back Page instantly became the most ordered item on Amazon or something.
Yeah, it was like trying to get baked goods in 2020 or like baking ingredients. No, I think it was because they got a massive Reddit push and we have benefited from that extraordinary coincidence. But I just wanted to acknowledge that those things have happened because it's great news for The Back Page family as a whole.
So with all that said and thank you for all your support, everybody, as we've been through these six episodes. We hope you've really enjoyed them. We've both really enjoyed making them.
And the plan for the future is to do something else down the line.
Smarter people would have come up with a name for the thing and a plan before the final episode to ensure continuity of listeners. We're not really like that.
We're not, are we? But you know what we're like by now. I think probably what we'd do, we'd definitely want to keep doing something, whether that's like a 2000s version of this for Samuel and Matthew, or whether it's like a spin-off, like something else.
Whatever we do, we'll probably try and go for like the late night talk show route of plugging the thing. So if you see Jeremy conspicuously appearing as a guest again on a Back Page episode, it will be to talk about the new podcast, and you'll probably find out that way, and perhaps on the Discord as well. So it's not goodbye.
We want to do more stuff, we just haven't organised it yet.
Yeah, and we'll probably put Review Wars at the centre a bit, because it feels like we're on to a good thing with that, and it's been fun. We've sort of experimented and grown bolder with it over the course of these episodes.
Yeah, exactly, and with a wider remit, what could we do with it? So yeah, I think that captures our imagination creatively, and it seems to have captured your imagination as consumers of our content. So yeah, we'll share more when we can figure it all out.
Should we start talking about old games though, Jeremy?
Yeah, alright.
Alright, let's take a little bit of an atmospheric break, get some quake noises in our heads, and then we'll reconvene and start talking about why Quake is apparently better than Half-Life.
Thanks We're back in the interim. I realized that Half-Life's got no Trent Reznor in it, so actually, immediately, Quake is in quite a strong position. So Jeremy, with that already in your favor, let's talk about Quake, the 1996 shooter that made Brown the most exciting color of the decade.
Yeah, I mean... Well... I've overcome with the pressure of making the argument for Quake, which I shouldn't be because it's one of the most beloved games of all time, and rightly so.
The weird thing about it is that it... Whenever I read about Quake, you start to realize that it was a concession for id, that it wasn't as ambitious as they wanted it to be, which feels insane because it's such a paradigm shift for shooters, such an enormous leap forward in how it looked and how it played, and literally the new dimensions it opened up. But they started making it with the sense that it wouldn't just be a first-person shooter, it wouldn't just be an upgrade of Doom.
John Romero had these ideas about, for starters, it was called Quake. It was named after a D&D character of his, a guy who wielded a hammer. Yeah.
This fellow Quake, we'd play him in first-person exploring, and the idea would be that it would be a fairly seamless, seamless overworld you'd be exploring, which was not really the thing at the time. Then when you came into combat encounters, it would switch to a side-on-view, almost like a Tekken or a Street Fighter.
That sounds bad.
He was quite excited about this pitch, that it would be this hybrid thing, and also there was a cube that would revolve around Quake, a sort of companion cube, you could say.
I was thinking of the world was a cube that was constantly shifting. It's starting to sound a bit like Final Fantasy VII, you're just wandering around exploring it overworld, and then it snaps into side-on combat. It's very different to Quake.
Yeah, and there was some suggestion of verticality, which you did get in Quake in the end, but like, oh, you could maybe... somebody would hit you on a hill, and you go tumbling all the way down to the bottom of the hill. It doesn't sound that fun.
But, you know, new.
I mean, that's one of the best things about Skyrim, is shouting people off the mountain.
Well, yeah, others, not yourself.
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's no fun at all. You just reload.
Or like when your horse dies, that's like properly harrowing when you like, because it's you that's done it as well. There's never someone that's pushed you. You've just like got overly ambitious, trying to go up or down a mountain, and then the horse's legs just buckle.
And then it's dead. And then you're almost dead. And you're just looking at the name, like on the HUD, it still shows the name of the horse, like Philip's horse, but like it's dead.
That's pretty, yeah. I'm glad that's not in Quake. Please continue.
We could have had Philip's horse is dead instead of Quake. Who knows? Yeah.
So I think it kind of like, that's going to sound baffling to people, but it kind of makes sense if you look at it in the context of, well, before Doom, it was making platformers in the vein of Mario. Before that, John Romero was making games in all sorts of different modes before a time where we really had fixed genres in games. These are guys who are kind of used to the idea that you make something and then you make something completely different.
I think Quake, for a variety of reasons, is the moment when the industry kind of solidifies of like, oh, you have a shooter studio. You have a strategy studio or a simulation studio, and you have a shooter studio, and it became a shooter studio at this moment because they realized they had all of this kind of momentum and expertise, and there were kind of stories from Quake's early development that John Carmack was busy making his incredibly innovative new engine tech, and there wasn't a lot for the designers to work with, and Romero was playing a lot of Deathmatch in the office, and some of the other people who worked on the project have said, he's a little distracted as well with working on stuff like Heretic outside of it, and sort of promoting Doom as this phenomenon. And without that sort of clear direction to something new, Quake just sort of became Doom 2.0, because that was what everybody there was good at.
That's a very rare example of somebody's vision being stifled for the better, right?
Yes.
Because as you've described it, Quake was going to be absolute bobbins, like some dikatana sort of material. I mean, maybe it would make a lot more sense in playable form, but considering the end result of Quake, the reality of it, I'm just really glad that whoever... Who was it that steered it that way?
Do you think it was just sort of by default they ended up making a shooter?
Yeah, the way it's told, and there's a really good making of Quake on Shaq News that you can still dig up, and the way it's told, John Carmack eventually sort of put his foot down and was like, well, this is the way things are moving, this is what we know how to do, let's make this game. And it's also around that time that Romero resolves to leave id Software, which he does at the end of Quake. So in a way, it's sort of like, it's this failure, it's the death of classic id Software and that partnership of the two Johns that, you know, is legendary and produced so much amazing stuff.
But yeah, it's also, you know, a resounding success when Quake comes out and is, takes the first person shooter to a literally new levels of verticality. And suddenly you can kind of, you find grenades in the bouncing off surfaces at all angles. And there's a soundtrack by Trent Reznor and it almost feels like, you know, the amplified version of Doom and it becomes hard to look back and play anything prior to it.
It's that sort of level of change which we don't ever really get in games anymore.
We don't and I think I'm always, yeah, going back to sort of reviewing, I think this is why I'm always disappointed when I review games and I always sort of tend to skew quite low because I think like there was a time when, you know, FIFA 99 looked so different to FIFA 98. You know, like some huge new innovation would have happened in the interim of like 11 months of development that made it look like absolutely transformed. You know, I'm not just picking on FIFA there like any sort of long running series.
The pace of change was so much faster back in those days. And now it's like, oh, we've introduced like a new AI system that you can't really see or discern. I mean, the leap forward from Doom is pretty seismic.
A lot of it is the tech. But like also, is the fact that it was based on a D&D character, is that the origin of its like slightly medievalness? Because that's my favorite thing about Doom.
It's like futuristic hybrids, like medieval worlds, like satanic stuff everywhere. Like, I guess a bit like Doom, but it's got this weird old English thing going through it as well, which seems like it might be, it might come from a D&D place.
Yeah, yeah. I think that's definitely part of the origin. If you look at the level names in Quake, especially Romero's levels, they call things like the Dismal Oubliette.
Yeah, that's a good level, actually.
This is great. And they build out these like, you know, there are literal dungeons in those levels. There are castles.
And yeah, it has this really distinct mood, which I think is brought about partly by that. Like the fact that it defaulted to something they knew. They were building like, OK, this is going to be quasi medieval sort of thing, but we're going to have guns because we know guns feel good and we know how to make them.
And somewhere in that mix, you have this, what's still a really distinct mood and character to this game, where, yeah, it's got this very gothic thing going on, but you also have elements of sci-fi. It's from the time right before. Developers felt the need to explain these things.
There's no explanation with Quake. It's just, it has a deep sense of place. The place doesn't strictly make sense, but it's almost like, well, it doesn't matter.
You're here. You've got to deal with it now.
Yeah, it's incredibly enigmatic. And perhaps also in contrast to how things would be done these days, everything feels like cut from that same cloth. You know, like you wouldn't necessarily think of a grenade launcher in a medieval castle, but like the noise of it, you know, like it sounds very like, it sounds almost like a sort of steam operated grenade launcher.
Yeah.
Like they, everything feels very much of that universe. And I'm going to end up talking about atmosphere again, so I'm going to stop myself. But yeah, there's just a, there's a cohesion between all the elements, between the sounds.
Somehow Trent Reznor's soundtrack is exactly like, you shut your eyes and you're, you're somehow in like quite a Gothic environment that it all just works so well. So I'm very pleased that it's not a side on Tekken game where you get kicked off the side of a hill and roll for 10 minutes.
Yeah. And it's funny, like Trent Reznor, now an Oscar winning soundtrack writer alongside Atticus Ross, but there's a huge, huge gap between the soundtracks he's done in the last 10 years or so and the one he did for Quake. It was the only soundtrack he'd done up to that point.
He didn't do any for a long time afterwards. And I find it kind of amazing that he really sort of understood the brief in a way I think most big name artists wouldn't. Like his voice is very sort of backgrounded.
He uses it in a kind of textural way for like unease. There are no words on the soundtrack, I don't think. And it just provides this really sort of grimy and unnerving atmosphere.
Yeah, absolutely. No, I don't think any. It was the perfect artist.
I can't think of anybody like, if money was no object, I can't think of anybody better to soundtrack Quake.
Yeah. And at the time, you know, Nine Inch Nails, like as a vibe and visually were inspiring others. They were inspiring people at it.
You know, that whole sort of industrial aesthetic, which was about unease, grime, rust, disgust.
Rusty walls, yeah.
Rusty walls, like all of that fed into Quake. And then they got, because in software was the most exciting thing in games at that time, they got the man himself to soundtrack it. And it's really the perfect pairing.
That says a lot about the nineties, doesn't it? That those collaborations could just happen that way. And then it wasn't, you know, like massively, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but it wouldn't have been like on the show floor at E3 wheeling out Trent Reznor to sort of high five audience members and announce this like collab.
They just did it.
It was a sort of like like minds meeting and becoming friends and it being produced through that way. I imagine it was a very different process when Reznor did the theme to Black Ops 2, I want to say, which is good in its own way. But, you know, it doesn't have that feel of like these people collaborating just because they really admire each other's work.
Absolutely. Listen, it's been too long since we've put some of these ideas into list format. I believe that you've arranged some top fives to make Quake's case.
So let's get into some of those.
So we've got a best moments list.
I want you to try and picture the scene as I describe some of these.
Okay.
We're in the first episode.
My eyes are closed for no reason.
We're in episode one, which is the level known as the Necropolis. I think it's the second level maybe. It's the first time you pick up a grenade launcher.
You round the corner and there's an ogre and he's behind a set of bars. You know the one? Right.
And he also has a grenade launcher. And on top of that, there's a sloping floor between you. That is the exact moment you realize there's all of this crazy physics going on and the potential of ricochets and it's a game changer.
Because all of these grenades, you try and shoot at the guy, the ogre with a grenade and inevitably it bounces off one of the bars at an odd angle and then it hits the floor and comes in another strange angle and causes you damage. And you're just trying to figure out this at the time unprecedented new world of trajectories. You know, there's nothing like that in D.
Nothing comparable at all. I think that's just a perfect moment to kind of encourage you to like open up your mind and just spend a bit of time experimenting.
I know the exact bit. Yeah, yeah. I also remember that I think by default I could be wrong here, but the mouse was mapped so that pushing forward on the mouse moved you forward.
So there was the added peril of like whenever you did launch a projectile of just like walking straight into it as well. Which is probably what I did the first time I played that as an idiot child. Just like pinged it off.
It went down the hill. I also just followed it down the slope into the ogre. But yeah, I know the exact bit.
And for my money, that first episode, that first cluster of levels is my favorite. Probably because it's the one I've played the most, but like it's the most quake. It goes a bit more sci-fi after that.
And like that, those first, I want to say six levels are the most like, as if they're visiting from Daggerfall.
Yeah, very much so.
Yes. So that's that's moment number one. I'm absolutely in agreement.
That is a fantastic moment. It's like, it's a classic bit of classic bit of id where this excitement for a new tech thing that they've developed takes form in something that like you don't immediately realize that this is like wizardry of code at work here. It's just you you just instinctively understand that there's a fun thing to be done.
And then only years later when you get into games journalism or like, you know, start thinking about games in a different way, you start to think like, God, what must that have taken to develop like projectile tech in 1996?
Yeah, and to have not just the geniuses there to create that stuff and Carmack and Michael Abrash, but designers who saw the potential of it and like, and put it to its best use.
You know, I guess that's the difference between Trespasser and Half-Life 2, you know, we were talking about last episode. It have always understood the potential of each tech breakthrough that they've developed. And that's a really great example of it, is just to put a grenade launcher just before a slope and an encounter that's going to be really satisfying to...
I'm playing, for no reason at all, I'm playing Aliens Colonial Marines at the moment. One of the many things that it does wrong is that like whenever it introduces something new to you, like a new weapon or system, instinctively, you know, because this was 2013, by now you're used to the way that that happens, is that you're given a new thing and then the very next encounter shows you the most fun way that you could possibly use it. Yeah.
And Colonial Marines doesn't do that. And it's because of id, and I would argue Valve later on, that we have that expectation that it's going to show you the most fun way to do that. But that precedent wasn't set before Quake and maybe Doom did a bit of it actually as well.
The first time you get some of those weapons in Doom, it sort of tees it up very nicely to have fun with it. But yes, great moment.
Yeah. When you pick up a new weapon in Quake, you're like, I should use this now because there's going to be a great showcase of it.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
My next moment is one of a couple of traps I'll be highlighting in this game. I think of this one as the kind of the Edgar Allan Poe short story trap. So there's a button, there's always a button and you press it and a trap door opens up beneath you and you find yourself in a corridor.
And it's stained with blood and it's blocked at both ends by bloody spikes.
I think I played this with you in co-op, didn't I?
Yeah, yeah, you did. And then those walls start to encroach. The spikes are getting closer and you're going to be crushed to death.
And the way you get out is by disabling the machinery. There's a couple of different points on the ceiling that you have to hit. And then once you do that, the walls fold away and you get to live another day.
I think this is like, it's one of those aspects of shooters, which is almost entirely absent now, is the traps and this sort of Indiana Jones sense that you're in an environment that's built to kill you. And you get trapped in moments where you've only got a handful of seconds to figure out how to deal with it. And maybe that's frustrating to modern design sensibilities, I don't know, but those moments always stick in my head from Quake.
Yeah, I always love a trap actually. Like if it's logical enough how to get out of it, then I'll gladly be taken on that ride. I think something that we just chatted about anecdotally while we were last playing Quake in co-op is how much you feel the level designer, their hand, and how much you feel that you're just like an absolute plaything of theirs, just being tossed back and forth in this.
You know, it's basically a ride, isn't it? It's basically a roller coaster, but like an incredibly enjoyable one that you do feel that you've got agency to, you know, maybe take a different corridor or do it at your own pace. But ultimately, you are just in a rat maze, but every corridor is the length of it is just perfect.
Yeah, like the mastery of level design is absolutely peerless.
Yeah.
And everything has been thought of.
That Romero style of level design where you just be kind of playing it hundreds and hundreds of times as you went along and just kind of testing like, okay, now play this few seconds and how does that feel? And that's how you get those kind of perfect timings and things that build tension in exactly the right way and release it exactly the right point. It's special.
I would say Dusk is the only game I've played recently that does that as well. Dusk's levels feel like they were made three seconds at a time. How can we make this three seconds enjoyable?
And also it helps that obviously it shares that aesthetic with Quakes 1 and 2. And I guess blood as well. It looks a lot like blood.
But yes, that's another fantastic moment. And I think I just straight up died. Maybe when we first were playing that together in co-op, I was just like, oh, well, I guess it wasn't ready to go down here.
That's that. I guess this is the end of the game. What a weird ending.
What still throws me is that because Mouse Look wasn't the default at that point, as I've mentioned, looking up in games is still something that takes me a minute. So if the solution to anything is to look up, I won't get it straight away, particularly if there's a time limit. I'll just be frantically looking around at eye level, like, well, there's no button, so it's impossible.
There was a bit in Sin that got me for maybe six months, quite early on, where you're emerging from a sewer and then you emerge into this construction site and you're in basically a big, dry swimming pool. And the solution is to look immediately above you and shoot a pipe and then the water fills you up and then you can swim out. But honestly, six months, I would just load it up, look around for 20 minutes, but I'd be like, no, I still can't do it, and then close it down, uninstall it, play a different game.
So I'm glad you were there for this one in Quake.
Yeah, human beings in general struggle with looking up, don't they? I mean, Dishonored's entire stealth system is predicated on the idea that if you're above someone, they won't notice you. And I often think, like, when I go to a new town, it always takes me a long time to notice the buildings above shop fronts.
Do you know what I mean? Like, I'll see boots and Games Workshop and all this stuff, and then months later I'll be like, there's like three floors of the ornate old building above this that I've never spotted.
We used to sneak up onto the rooftops in York. As a younger man, when I worked at a bar in York, York is obviously like a very touristy, picturesque old city with just such grandiose architecture. And there was a way, just down the back of what was Woolworths, you could access all the rooftops, and it was incredibly dangerous, Jeremy.
It stresses me out in thinking about it. But we do that after a shift when we're all hammered, get up onto the rooftops, and then the other side, one side of it with all the storefronts was one of the main streets, the other side was just the river. Just the inky black stillness of the river at 3am when you've had nine Jaeger bonds.
There's something about the river in York as well, isn't there? It's sort of swollen and it really feels dangerous.
It is dangerous. Well, one day Armstrong just started sliding, he just lost his balance and he just slid all the way down the roof. And I was immediately thinking of like, oh my god, he's like, he's in the river and he's dead.
He just came to a stop with his legs dangling off as if he was just like sitting in the gutter. He just came to a stop and he just turned around and was like, hahahaha.
I was like, oh my god, I'm not cut out for this life.
Someone give me a staff writer job in games journalism. Get me away from this hedonism.
You sound like you were living in Dishonored at that time, except you were like one of the guards that Corvo snuck up on and slit their throat.
Absolutely hapless, devoid of supernatural powers. I've completely derailed your Quake moment there, but it is a good one. Let's have another one.
Killing Chthon. So this is the boss at the end of that first episode.
Yes.
I think the first boss fight id Software ever did. You have the Barons of Hell in Doom and this kind of stuff, but they're staged fights. But this is the first one I like.
There's a sequence of steps you have to take to bring him down. You've got to go and stand on these plates, which bring up these two points between which there's a bottle of electricity that fires and zaps him. And at the same time, you've got to dodge the attacks.
There's a big pit of lava in the center of the room and globules of lava being thrown around.
Yeah, it's not just shooting at him, is it?
Yeah, and the fight's fine, but the best bit is once you've beaten him and the camera cuts away to the corner of the room so you can see the whole scene, there are gibs exploding everywhere. Just more gibs than could possibly have come from Chthon. And there's like some cheesy pros on screen about conquering the dimensions.
And then Reznor's Quake theme kicks in.
Imagine Reznor doing it, not me, and it's really compelling. And that's the moment you realize the game has its hooks in you.
Yeah, I mean, you always go back and start the next episode after doing that. I've never just left it there and gone, oh, well, that's that bit done in three weeks. So yeah, you're straight back in because you've got to see what the next world looks like.
Yeah, cool moment.
It just you feel the potential. You're like, oh, my God, I've just experienced this. What else am I going to find?
And yeah, it's great. The ultimate shareware sell. I suppose that must that will have been the end of the three episode, right?
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.
Yeah. Yeah.
Do you think it was a little bit frontloaded?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like the last episode is the most kind of frustrating and the first two are the strongest, I would say.
What's interesting is like Tim Willetts is responsible for quite a lot that first episode, and he's like the least experienced level designer at the time. So that's quite pretty cool that he got to kind of showcase what he could do. You know, he'd been a modder beforehand, and I think worked maybe at Raven down the road from Aird or something.
Oh no, he worked on Strife, I think. Who made Strife? Developed by Rogue Entertainment.
Oh, Rogue, yeah, yeah.
Every steward that worked on a Doom adjacent game with it at that time went on to make other cool stuff. So they made American McGee's Alice, eventually. Yeah.
Which one of them was it that went on to do that?
It's too American McGee's Alice.
It's funny, don't worry.
Was that Willitz?
No shortage of ego at his software at that time, has to be said.
Okay.
So we're down to the top two. Are these in ascending or descending order?
I mean, it's sort of...
Are there just five great moments?
Like Quake itself, slightly front-loaded probably. I don't know. This is a good one, but it comes from near the beginning of the game.
Another trap, again in the Necropolis, along with the yoga behind bars. So you climb into a lift and you press a button. And it's the second lift you come to in that level.
The first one you press the button, the lift rises. Bob's your uncle. This time you press the button, lift doesn't move.
Instead, the ceiling descends and keeps descending. And you look for a button to shoot and there isn't one. And just as that ceiling is scraping the top of your skull, it parts in two pieces.
And then the lift rises and it takes you up to the final fight and the exit. It's a fake out. It's a fake out.
Oh, that is good.
And it's the ultimate moment of the designer just kind of laughing at you and blowing with you.
Yeah. I love that stuff. Yeah.
I think there should be more of that. I mean, I think that's like, that's why there are boomer shooters is that people do enjoy, you know, what can be done with some fairly rudimentary like component parts, just some corridors and some sprites. Like then all the emphasis is on like, what do you do with them?
How do you pace it? What surprises can you throw at you with that within those constraints? Like I'm all about constraints with creativity and I don't want to get harp on about that again.
But I think, yeah, I'd say, you know, games like Prodeus and Dusk are good evidence that we do still have an appetite, at least a subset of us has an appetite for just being a level designers play thing. If the level designer is id Software mid 90s tier.
Yeah, yeah, we got to be good. But yeah, having that sort of one on one relationship with a level designer is a really cool thing. I do miss.
Absolutely. OK. And the final, the final best moment to make Quake's case as one of the great games.
Well, the great game better even than Half-Life is this.
Fittingly, it's from the final episode, final level. Final boss. Yeah, Shub-Nagurath.
I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
The mother.
Yeah, it's a cool like it's a cool thing. It's like as far as Quake lore goes, just like to see this thing. But like the boss fight is absolute bullshit, Jeremy.
It's absolute nonsense.
Listen, it is. It is. And I had to look up how to finish it.
And yeah, it's a little like a thought in that like, this is a little good drive. But so the mother of of all these monsters, she's a sort of bulbous meaty mass thing. Horns coming out.
And I think she'd be the first to say that as well.
We're not having a pop.
Not to speak ill of anyone's mother. But yeah, she kind of sits in the middle of a pit of lava, she's invulnerable. But there's a sort of weird spiky sphere that slowly floats around in a vicinity.
Maybe it's the last sort of remaining echo of Romero's weird first quake pitch. And that sphere is the end point to a portal. And to get into that portal you have to battle all the way around the outside of the chamber.
Kill these incredibly tough enemies. Shambles for days. And step through that portal.
And you've got to do it at the right moment. And the right moment is when the sphere passes through Shubber South. And if you do that, it's a telephrag.
Teleport right into the center of a boom. Game over.
Telephrag is just a very evocative bit of terminology. It's almost turning me around to liking it.
It's a little evocation of the multiplayer of Quake, isn't it? Where that was a thing that happened. If you stood in the wrong point, at the end point of a portal, it doesn't matter how much armor you're wearing, you're exploding, mate, I'm afraid.
So it's a little tribute to that.
Yeah, still one of the best things to do in Quake Champion. Quake Champions, if you're playing as Ranger, you get that tele-frag ability. You could just use it to teleport if need be, but you can frag people with some expert timing and it's the best thing you can possibly do in Quake Champions.
I feel like people maybe forget about Quake Champions, but it's so good. I think because the skill level is so high, it's really impenetrable, but good game. And basically, yeah, the tele-frag lives on in it.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I played a little Quake Champions. I've seen champions play Quake Champions at QuakeCon.
It's an incredible thing.
That feels like you're going into SEO mode. Trying to get us to rank. You can take the writer out of PC Games then.
Who are the Quake Champions? The Quake Champions or the Champions of Quake?
We simply don't know yet. The event has not taken place.
Well, those are all very compelling moments, Jeremy, to be honest. I'm sure they resonate with... I was going to say our readership.
I think that's how back page listeners think of themselves as a readership.
Readers of the digital archive. Yeah, absolutely. I'm in agreement with all of those.
I don't think any other moments come to mind that I would say one up that. I like going underwater in Quake. I can't explain why.
I guess it's the verticality thing. They find ways to make it extremely stressful. They're like, right, you've got to go underwater.
You understand that much. You go underwater. You realize that there's almost like a whole level under there that you can see.
Like, what is this? There's quite a sense of wonder because it's loads deeper than you realize. And then there's a room within the center of this huge pool.
And then you've got to press the button or whatever.
Yeah, re-emerging in a new room has got a sort of apocalypse now feel to it. Like you feel like some kind of sicko commando.
It's pretty cool. And also it makes you put it plays a bit of a trick on you because you think that there was an extra bit of level that you've bypassed. When in fact, like that you're on the critical path.
Yeah, done it through water. You're like, oh, I've hacked the level and I've like cut out a quarter of it. And I wonder what I missed.
Yeah, for me, that's a prompt to go, I'll go back and I'll check.
Yeah, I might have like missed like a new weapon or something. I'm not taking that risk. Yeah.
That would be the only thing I'd add. But like, yeah, I can see why you didn't add water as one of the five best moments in like the arguably the best shoot of the 90s because that would seem silly. So those are the best moments.
So that was good fun. Thank you for putting that together for us, Jeremy. But there's more to come, because what you've also done is something involving sounds in Quake.
Is that right?
Yeah. So I've picked out what I think are the five best sounds in Quake, and I'd like to quiz you on them.
I would like to be quizzed on them.
I've developed a point system.
I think this will be a great time for us both, and I appreciate that you've done it.
Good. Well, the idea is that I will first impersonate each of the sounds.
Yes, of course.
And if you manage to, yes, of course. And if you manage to get it from that performance, then you get two points.
Right, okay.
If not, we fall back to the actual sound.
Yeah.
You know, this off the game, and you'll get one point if you get that correct. And if you don't get it at all, of course, that's zero points.
So there's a maximum of 10 points available. If I get all the cues from the non-diegetic versions.
That's right, that's max, isn't it?
Then it's 10 points. And then it would be five points if I get all of the diegetic in-game samples of audio. And then if I don't understand them at all, I get zero points for each one.
So maximum of 10 points on the table. These are the quake sound effects. And sound is such a central part of nostalgia in gaming.
I think it works a bit because we don't have smell in games and smell is like weirdly evocative. There's actually something about the way that your neural pathways are formed with smells is that you sort of like, you access all these dormant, like there's a reason that smell is so evocative when it comes to memory is what I'm trying to get out. And I've completely forgotten why that is in your brain chemistry.
However, because we don't have that in games, games have no smell, which is probably a good thing in both Half-Life and Quake. Sound, I think occupies a similar role for us when we're being all nostalgic about it, because we tend to see these games quite often in like in screenshot form or like sort of a little bit of capturing a YouTube video about how great the 90s was. But it's only when we're like completely immersed back in that audio environment that we get the full nostalgia hit.
And we forget about like for me, the Sierra I dent in Half-Life, yeah, it's just so evocative. So I think it's a great idea that we're doing these sounds and they are among the best sounds in 90s gaming full stop. So without further ado, that's me just going off on a little one there.
Let's hear the first sound cue from Quake.
They're the most generic noise I've ever heard. Grrr.
Is it? Can I have it again?
Grrr.
All right. Is it the ogre?
It isn't actually. I actually thought it was the ogre in my memory, but it wasn't. I had to search around to find out who was responsible for it.
Yeah. So obviously it's an enemy. It's one of their barks or chirps.
Correct.
The only sort of things that... Oh, or is it just like the... Is it like the grunt enemies in the second episode that are more just like the...
They look like you. They're like zombie rangers.
Good guess, but no, yeah, a lot of them in the sci-fi levels, aren't they?
Okay, I'm going to have to go to the real sound effects and probably still won't get it. So this is a maximum of one point available now.
Exactly.
Oh, it was actually a really good impression you did.
Oh, thanks.
I was laughing at it, but like, do you know what? That's bang on.
I think it's all the pointers that Ray Fiennes gave me last episode, which really improved my craft.
Yeah. He's really got under your skin, hasn't he? And I've not heard a peep from him since.
So I think that tells you all you need to know about the progress you've been making, mate. I'm going to listen to it one more time.
Yep.
Oh, I just, I just don't know because it could be man or beast.
Well, I'll tell you, it's somewhere in the middle. It's the death night.
Really?
Do you know, that was the first thing that I discussed. I was like, it's definitely not the night.
No, that's him.
Oh, well, I'm going to do terribly through all of these then.
If I didn't get that one.
That was the only thing that was like off the table in my mind. So great. Good.
Well, it was enjoyable and it was a very good impression. And I'm sorry that I laughed for about an hour and 45 minutes at your guru. It was just like I was expecting something so specific that could only be in Quake and I just got the noise of every enemy I've ever shot for the last 30 years.
Okay. Well, I think this is more unusual. I'm going to play Quake Sound 2 now and I'm going to perform that for you live.
Quake Sound number 2.
Oh, okay. Can I hear it one more time, please?
I'd say this one's harder for the human voice. To replicate.
I do recognize it. I do recognize it. I'm thinking perhaps in terms of like teleporting or...
No, no. I'm going to let you... You've gone straight to the right answer there.
I'm not going to give you a chance to lose that point. You got it. That's the teleporter.
Oh, amazing. Well, that's testament to your human foley art there. So for everyone playing along at home, let's hear the real version of that from the game sound effect itself now.
Yeah, that's pretty difficult to do with just a human voice.
So I'm amazed you got it.
Yeah. And yet I didn't get the death knight. Interesting.
Yeah. I think you might well get this next one as well.
So I'm two from a possible four points so far.
Yeah, that's right.
All right. Let's listen to Quake Sound number three.
It's taken me a minute to recognise that, but that is the unmistakable noise of a grenade from a grenade launcher hitting a stone surface.
That's exactly right. And it's a noise we've already mentioned in this episode.
It's my favourite noise in Quake. It's what I think of. When I think of Quake, that's the noise that comes up.
Oh, that was a great impression of it as well. Quite startling, but yeah, it was fantastic.
As it should be. It's like a smoke alarm. You want the sound of a grenade bouncing to startle you.
So it wakes you up.
It's very true. Yeah. Don't want to be dozing when those are going off.
Right, let's hear the real version of that then.
Oh.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It's like, I feel like I've listened to a full Enya album.
And you hear it multiple times in Quake succession, don't you?
You do, yeah, they bubble up all around the place. Okay, so I'm six for, six for eight.
Four for six.
No, four for six.
We're unnecessarily complicating this. You have four points so far.
Yes.
Two more questions.
I'm buoyed by that recent success and I feel like I can do well now.
Yeah, two very quick successes, okay.
Yes, okay, quake sound number four.
Oh, oh, oh, I think it's the yeti throwing his lightning fork at you.
Oh, it's not. I almost used that sound because that's got a beautiful bounce to it. It kind of goes boom, but there's a little sort of like pitching boom noise, but I didn't end up using that.
Yeah, I'd like to hear my impersonation again.
Yes, please.
You got to think about who might be swinging.
Well, yeah, I guess I'm thinking about the knights again. But the knights have already been and done their... Arrrr!
No, well, I'll give you that, because there are two different knights in this game. There's the death knights, the upgraded form of the knight, and this is the regular knight. And this is like his alert sound, but it's easier.
I presume he's pulling his sword out of his sheath.
All right. Well, so am I getting the points for that? I reckon I should maybe get one, because you helped me out a lot.
You got there. You got there. So, let's hear that then.
Oh, again, very good.
It's got two distinct elements, hasn't it?
Yeah. And you did it all in one sort of... It's like playing the didgeridoo, the way that you're creating these.
You're making noises with your voice. I didn't know it was humanly possible. Okay, so now I am six for eight.
Yes.
So, I can get a maximum of eight out of 10 points here if I get this based on the Jeremy impression. So...
I think this one's a little harder for me to impersonate and for you to get, but it's a noise I really like, so...
Well, we're warmed up, so both of us. So, we can do it. I believe in us.
Here goes the fifth best quake sound.
Ah, yeah.
I definitely recognise it and I think it's the floaty ghosty enemies. Is it?
Yes.
Is it like the attack sound of the floaty ghosty enemies?
Well, I'm going to give you one point for that because I also thought it was their attack sound. I looked into it. It's actually the pain sound.
So it's when you're hitting them. But in the sort of the chaos of the fight, you wouldn't necessarily know what's causing it.
Yeah. Well, there's also all the from the grenades going everywhere.
Yeah.
Just chaos.
I think it plays every time you hit them. So it's sort of like you get a sort of staccato.
It was beautifully done. Well, let's hear the real version of that as well.
It sounds really disappointed in you.
I've told you not to shoot me.
Well, wonderful. So if I got one point for that last one time.
Seven out of ten.
Seven out of ten.
The Back Page is very fond of seven out of tens.
Yes, exactly. I may yet be appreciated beyond my time with that score. Well, fantastic, Jeremy.
I think you did very well. Yes. Well, you guided me along very expertly there.
But yeah, I think you've got a career in like sort of live sound effecting. Thank you. Yeah.
You know, if people are like for game jams and stuff where people don't have time to go and create, you know, audio libraries, you can just be there and just sort of like soundtrack it on the fly as people play.
Yeah, just a little bit. That'd be cool. Yeah.
Yeah.
So shall we follow a quiz with a quiz? That's good podcast structuring, isn't it?
Please do. Do you know what? It feels like the last day of term at school, doesn't it?
Well, it just goes out the window like, oh, let's just watch Tom and Jerry cartoons on a VHS and then we'll play some snakes and ladders. Let's do a quiz then. Yes.
So this game is called John Romero's About to Make You. And of course, you can explain to our listeners who aren't familiar why it would be called this.
Well, in print media through 1998, Daikatana ran a full page ad, the hero copy just said, John Romero's About to Make You is bitch. And it became infamous because of course, I think it probably would have been a bad ad, even if Daikatana was the next Quake or Half-Life, but it was a particularly bad ad because then Daikatana was like this five out of ten shambles. Actually, I played it last year for the first time and really enjoyed it, but only through the lens of sort of silly nostalgia.
Yeah.
So that's where the phrase comes from. John Romero is about to make his pitch. I think it's probably his biggest regret in life.
And I'm sure it wasn't his idea.
I mean, it's shocking, but it's not that shocking in the context of 90s gaming ads, you know, in the era of Attitude. They're complete non sequiturs in terms of advertising.
The Attitude era. We're back into wrestling. I think this has got legs.
If there's one thing this podcast needs, it's to talk about wrestling more. There's really an unserved niche there to be. Not enough gaming podcasts branch out into wrestling.
So, we've got... The game is, John Romero is about to make you do something.
It may be a good thing or a bad thing. I'm going to give you the connecting word after John Romero is about to make you something. Based on that connecting word, you have to decide whether you're going to go ahead with it, opt in or not.
All right. I'll probably understand more after the first one. I feel like I'm going to be placed in some compromising positions here.
Sure. Are you ready?
Well, I'm not sure. Let's find out.
John Romero is about to make you, ah.
Right. And then I just have to decide whether I'm up for that.
Based on that connecting word, you have to think, oh, is that... Imagine what that could be. Whether you're up for it or not.
The first thing I was thinking of is like a pie or like a coffee or it's just going to do me like a culinary favour. It's going to make me dinner.
So you're up for that then?
Because I don't see why not. I mean, we've all seen what the guy can do with level design. What can he do in the kitchen?
You know, that would be fascinating. If he takes you on a similar journey of like, you know, the pitfalls and the stakes and the non-secateurs and the diversions and the doubling back. If you can do that with taste, then I'm more than willing to try one of John Romero's culinary creations.
Yeah, because cooking is very iterative, isn't it? You know, his first spag bol might be a disaster, but his 30th...
Yeah, there'd be John Carmack just really sort of deliberating over where he's sourcing the ingredients. And each time, you know, the bolognese is made, then it's like, you know, the beef has come from somewhere else. It's been stored slightly differently.
All the technical aspects in this ham-fisted metaphor have been taken care of. And John Romero is just freestyling in the kitchen. He's just like throwing in these new ingredients.
Yeah, with his ham-fists.
It's like a tartare bolognese this time. I'm quite hungry for that. Yeah, I'm definitely up for that one.
I'm up for John Romero is about to make me something culinary.
OK, well, I can tell you that John Romero is about to make you a cup of tea before you go to work.
Ah, yes. Yes, I'm completely up for that. And that's really nice of him.
So I appreciate that, John. Thank you.
He's a busy man as well. Yeah, his own family to think about. For him to take time out to do that for you, I think that's lovely.
The only downside of that is the social awkwardness involved, because he's obviously a lot higher status than I am. So for him to be making me a tea is a bit weird.
You'd probably thank him a bit too much.
Yeah, and he'd be like, yeah, no problem. And I'd still just be like, oh, but honestly, no. And it tastes great.
You put just the right amount of milk in it.
You bring doom into it. Yeah, you'd be like, oh, by the way, just like, he's really been really important to me. And it'll just be like a bit too heavy before breakfast.
Yeah, yeah. And he's just like, yeah, yeah, yeah, like, no worries. And I'd leave feeling like I've embarrassed myself there.
But given the opportunity for that to happen or not, I think I'm right to say yes.
Yeah, I think you were as well. Okay, next one. John Romero is about to make you go.
Right. I'm more hesitant about this one because something's happening to me here. I'm not just receiving something.
Go. And I'm not great with travel, Jeremy. I'm quite nervous when it comes to travel.
It could be like go ape, you know, or like go bananas. It could just be to deliver such a great game that I go wild for it. But I don't think it's that.
I think I'm going to have to go somewhere. And if it involves plane travel, I'll be nervous on the flight. But like I think I think life's about saying yes to opportunities.
I'm still going to say yes.
All right. Well, John Romero is about to make you go to the shops for a cornetto.
Oh, fine. So it's quid pro quo, really, in a really low stakes way. He's made me a cup of tea, but he expects a cornetto out of me.
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of, you know, it could be an inconvenience. He might have had other plans, but it's not going to hurt, is it?
It wouldn't take long. And like, what a story. Again, you know, like, I can't stress this enough.
Like, John Romero is such so much higher status than me that whatever plans I did have for the day would be subsumed by going to the shop to get him a cornetto, because then I'll be telling everyone later on, do you know what I just did today?
Yeah, almost like the modanity of it enhances the anecdote, doesn't it? In a very British sort of way, like what's, you know, mundane thing involving a celebrity. We love that stuff.
We do. It hams home that they're human just like us.
Yeah. Okay. Next one.
John Romero is about to make you inhale.
I'm not up for that.
No?
And it's nothing on John.
I think if any sentence began with that, no matter who the name, Mary Berry is about to make you inhale. It wouldn't matter. Trevor Nelson's about to make you inhale.
I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
Yeah.
Like, how many good things are there to inhale? Oxygen. That's literally it.
And he's not gonna make me inhale oxygen, is he? Because I'm doing that passively. As a matter of course, so.
Yes. As much as I've said that life's about saying yes, I can't, I can't condone inhaling something. So I'm gonna say no, but let's hear what it was gonna be.
What have I missed out on?
I think you've been wise. John Romero is about to make you inhale an entire packet of cigarettes so that you never think of smoking again.
Oh, I'm really glad I said, I said no to that.
Yeah, that would be unpleasant, wouldn't it? Awful.
And the fact, again, the fact that it's John doing it, I'd feel like I'd let him down by smoking in the first place.
Yeah, it creates a dynamic, doesn't it? He's doing a sort of like 50s dad thing.
Yeah, I've let him down.
Tough love. You know, you've been a little wayward as a teen. Maybe caught you smoking one cigarette and he's like, right, here, this is how we're gonna deal with this.
And then it's gonna be over.
Yeah, I'd feel really, really self-conscious. I'd probably throw up. It'd just be like a real low point.
And it wouldn't be something I tell people about. Not like the Cornetto story. You know, I'd tell nobody about that time.
Yeah. I don't have to say, I don't think he would do that. He seems like a very modern man to me.
I don't know what the sort of libel implications are for all of this, but just to cover it all up. John Romero has no part to play in this podcast. We have not been in touch with John.
We have no reason to believe that he would make me, you or anyone listening do any of these things.
Indeed.
We have the utmost respect for John Romero and all the games that he's made. This is purely hypothetical.
Purely. Let's move on to the next one.
John Romero is about to make you wish.
Well, yeah, that's never good, is it? No one's ever been like, yeah.
We don't know, do we?
It sounds like something so bad is going to happen that I'm going to wish for something less bad that usually would be bad. But I'm going to wish for that scenario because it's gone that bad in reality. I wish that I was just smoking a whole pack of cigarettes because he's done something worse.
So, you know, a forced wish is never... I'm even thinking what if it's the most benign thing, just like a lovely birthday wish or wish upon a star? But to force you into it, there's a sinister element to that.
So I'm going to have to say no once again, I think, on that one.
Yeah, okay. I did think of wish upon a star, but yeah, it was a weird sort of forceful wishing upon a star. I just didn't really want to go there.
Okay, so the answer is, John Romero is about to make you wish you'd only met earlier. So you could have been in each of his eyes from the start.
It's so unexpectedly sweet.
That's a shame, isn't it?
That's the ideal version of the magazine ad as well.
I think it was just like the Dicotana box art that was on the ad, but instead of that, it's just like a really earnest picture of him smiling. And then that ad copy.
Well, that was something.
Oh, sorry, there's one more.
Oh, God. Right. Okay.
Okay.
There are only five. They just feel quite long, don't they now? John Romero is about to make you his.
Oh, this is the boss level.
It takes the classic form.
It could go so many directions. It could be that he's about to make me like his signature chili.
Or he could be making me something of his that's really special to him and that he's really proud of. Or it could be, I'm thinking of the his in terms of like a status thing. So, you know, bitch, for example, you know, just a plucker, you know, just out of thin air.
You know, slave, underling, employee. I wouldn't say no to that. I'm not sure what I could do for him.
Go and work at Romero Games in Galway, a growing company. He's working on a shooter currently.
Do they need a podcast doing?
Could be.
Yeah. John Romero is about to make you his senior press officer. I don't think I'd be good at that.
But I feel like I should say yes to this one because I've been quite, you know, avoidant. It's been closing a lot of doors and I missed out on that last one where we were becoming friends in an early age. I'm going to say yes.
That's good. Let's hear it.
John Romero is about to make you his lawfully wedded partner.
Oh, wow. Well, one really followed on from the last one, didn't it?
Yeah.
So it's nice. Even though I sort of declined on that, we've still ended up in lawful matrimony. So that's great.
He is, of course, happily married. This is purely a hypothetical.
Good. Well, yeah. Thanks for taking me on that journey.
And I think we've really like answered all the questions that original magazine ad raised back in the day. So we can finally put that to bed, I think now.
Good. I hope so.
Well, you've got your review war to do. And before we get into Half-Life, should we just sort of talk about why Quake's good? Because we've done a lot of like sounds.
Talking around Quake.
Yeah, let's spend a few minutes at least, like just talking about how absolutely amazing it is to play because we, yeah, we've played it through in co-op recently, haven't we? And it still just slaps. Like the levels are just, even after all this time, they stand apart from anything else, like in corridor shooters in the 90s, it absolutely refined that form.
Yeah.
Just before it went off in a different direction.
It has that quality in common with Doom, but it doesn't seem to age in the way it plays. And partly that's because shooters went in a different direction. They became more cinematic, more scripted, more controlled and more story driven.
Whereas Quake, like Doom, is just kind of, you've got a vague premise and off you go. And within that kind of freedom, you don't really need to know where you are. You're just in an absorbing Gothic maze.
And there's just you and the enemy in front of you. It's a very, very simple form of appeal that you don't get so often in games now.
What I was thinking about earlier as well is that, I think there's maybe something wrong with the fact that often our first exposure to a game is us playing it, or like we're experiencing it in playable form, or we're seeing a trailer straight away. Whereas there's something about the mystique that a game like Quake was able to build up even before anything but the name was revealed. It was the new game from the Doom developers.
And then you would just see this very moody, dusty, industrial bit of artwork. And something about Trent Reznor's involvement also added to that image and the mystique of it. And so by the time you played it, it felt like you were in the presence of something much bigger than you and quite scary.
And it was a bit like, I guess in the same way that, you know, when you first discover music these days, it's just because a song pops up on your shuffle and you just hear it and that's the music. You don't know anything about the band. They haven't had any chance to develop an image for you in the way that music would have done.
That's what the formalised music industry was all about. 20 years ago was sort of carefully cultivating images and sort of aspirational stuff around musicians. I think that's sort of broadly true of games as well.
And Quake was like a proper rock star. It had like a rock star persona and it was formidable and slightly scary to be in its company. A bit like listening to a Slipknot album when you were a teenager as well.
Weapons, just fantastic. I'm not a massive fan of the rocket launcher in Quake though. It's sort of like the big legendary weapon from that game, but for whatever reason, I just don't really enjoy it.
It shares ammo with the grenade launcher, right? Does it? I always prefer to use, or maybe it doesn't, but I prefer to use the grenade launcher in almost all situations.
And even though it's very bouncy, I feel like I end up damaging myself less than when I use the rocket launcher. It's like a very high-risk weapon in tight corridors.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. There's only a few quite specific scenarios where a rocket launcher is useful. I guess maybe it forged its legend in multiplayer, which we haven't really touched on, but by the time when I was first playing Quake, I'm not sure I had the internet, let alone the willingness and ability to go online and play death matches.
It's like the seismic moment in online death match, but it just passed me by. To me, Quake is like this single-player game with incredibly finely wrought levels, but maybe the rocket launcher's prominence came from multiplayer maps, which were a bit more out in the open, and you would probably dominate if you managed to get hold of the rocket launcher, and you could sort of rocket jump from what I remember. It does push you back slightly, doesn't it?
Even in Quake 1.
Yeah, I think so.
So people were probably beginning to experiment with rocket jumps and things like that.
I think in single-player that one of the more striking weapons is the nail gun, right? Just the sound it makes and the nine-inch nails box, the logo on the box in the game when you pick it up and the sheer power of it.
Yeah, really thematically cohesive. It's like the ultimate Gothic industrial weapon, just this massive nail gun with actual nine-inch nails, branded nine-inch nails coming out of it. Yeah, super good.
And the individual projectile models, that was probably quite impressive in 96.
Yeah, and they used that a lot in the design of the levels themselves, don't they, with the spikes firing out of walls and all of that. You know, a real sense that the level itself has been built to hurt you.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's like there's a whole, there's like some sentient being above all of this that you're experiencing that, you know, I mean, I guess that's the final boss, or in a way it's the game developer, but the real enemy is something like completely unseen that has crafted all of this for you.
I think you've created a perfect segue into my review war there.
Have I indeed? Well, let's do that then. So yeah, it's a game with two halves this one.
So we'll draw the Quake half of the episode to a close with Jeremy's review war. I think you've made a wonderful case for Quake here. And what better way to sort of close that argument with some sort of musical or audio landscape involving the copy that you would have written as your Quake review if you were a working games journalist in 1996.
Yeah, as always, slightly broken the concept. This one's written in such a way that it definitely couldn't have been written in 96.
Interesting. Well, mine really runs contrary to that for Half-Life. So you'll have to see what I've done with it.
Let's listen then to Jeremy's Review War of Quake.
How do you think of a level designer? Perhaps as one role among hundreds on a big budget video game. Thief designer Randy Smith told me that being a level designer is a great privilege.
That after all the art assets and props and mechanics have been created, the level designer is the one left holding the brush. Painting the only thing the player will see.
Back in the 90s, the level designer was God. At id Software, a single person would map out an entire level. They decided where the enemies went, how high the ceilings were, and where the traps triggered.
They were the dungeon master.
As a player in Quake, you can still feel the malevolent presence, the fact that you're facing off against an all-seeing antagonist.
You can even look up their names. Each of Quake's four episodes is majority owned by an individual designer, as if four solo albums have been packaged together for release. Tim Willits filled Episode 1 with castles, moats and brick textures, embracing gothic architecture.
Sandy Peterson, the designer of the tabletop game Call of Cthulhu, leaned into Lovecraft.
Over time, you come to know their personalities and adapt accordingly. A John Romero level is all about contrasts, the air required before the shambler breaks loose. Whereas in Peterson's company, you can expect to manage your ammo count carefully and fight something without a face.
It's this I miss about Quake and the era of shooters it represents. Knowing my enemy, keeping them so close, I can feel their breath on the back of my neck.
Oh, moody. I love the album of solo albums. The idea of it.
That's good, Jeremy. Where's the audio underneath from? That bed of throbbing.
So that is from the Quake soundtrack. Oh, of course it is. Classic bit at Resnair.
Sort of breathing down our necks there.
Yeah. Oh, wonderful. Well, once again, it's like actual games criticism happening there.
That's really sort of made me think and appreciate Quake and it just makes me really want to play it again. Maybe that's what I'll do after we've recorded this. I'll just go back and play Quake.
The Night Dive remaster is absolutely fantastic, isn't it? Like that's something that we should definitely mention.
Oh, yeah, like the first time I played Quake, it was a little difficult, like figuring out what kind of fan-made engine I should use to make it kind of run and look best on a modern PC. Now you just buy the Quake remaster on Steam or what have you. It's on various platforms now and it just looks great and it looks faithful to the original and it runs beautifully and it's got co-op.
And it's also got extra episodes from Among Others machine games, the Wolfenstein developers. Those are really good. I've played through quite a lot of that stuff.
It's tons of really specific options as well. It feels sort of like a modding platform or just the most expertly modded version of the game where everything is just running. You don't have to worry about it falling over.
If you've forgotten to put a particular file somewhere, yeah, just a really good remaster. It feels like it was just always intended to be played in co-op, which is absolutely miraculous as an achievement. So that's Quake.
Let's take a break, stretch our legs, cleanse our palates, and then we'll reconvene for the second half of this episode in which I'll be making the case for the 1998 first person shooter from Valve Software, Half-Life.
So we're back, and this time we're gonna be talking about Half-Life. This is, without doubt, my personal favorite game of all time. I can't see anything catching it now.
Like, I don't know what would need to happen in technology for any game to blow me away as like a grown-up man, more than Half-Life, that really liked the first PC game that I ever played, blew me away in 98 as a 13-year-old kid. So let's get straight into it. I've also come up with some best moments, Jeremy, that I'd like to regale you with and get your thoughts on.
Please do.
I've arranged them sort of in order. Yeah, I'm gonna do it this way. I'm gonna do it from five to one in ascending order.
It's really like a magazine feature.
Yeah, absolutely. So number five for me is reaching the Lambda Labs. And I will tell you for why.
Half-Life is a game that's, for me, one of the most striking things about it is that it's a story told in real time. There's not a single cutaway, no time passes that you're not seeing through the eyes of Gordon Freeman. And I've always struggled to articulate why I like Half-Life's story so much.
Maybe I've told this anecdote before on a previous podcast, but I remember being at a press event and having a dinner later on in the evening after we'd been interviewing devs at the studio somewhere. And I was with David Jenkins from Metro and Nick Cohen, who was at The Telegraph at the time. And one of them asked me what my favorite, we got onto Half-Life and what my favorite game was.
And I said, Half-Life. And they said, well, what do you like about it? And I said, I think it's the story.
And they both looked at me really quizzically. And I just buckled under the pressure and I couldn't articulate why, because really the story is pretty meat and potatoes. What happens is an interdimensional rift opens up in a research facility in New Mexico.
Aliens pour through it. There's a battle between an improbably tough research scientist called Gordon Freeman and all the forces from an alien dimension. And then some soldiers as well who come along to silence the whole, to clear up the whole business and make sure that the wider world doesn't hear about it.
And that's not really like Dickens, is it? But I think what I meant was it's the way the story's told in completely continuous first person narrative. And mind you, without Freeman obviously saying a word the entire time, that is absolutely thrilling to me.
So by the time you reach the Lambda Labs, it feels sort of amazing that this place existed that you've heard about so much. It's been built up, the scientists have directed you to it, the Barneys have referenced it a bunch of times. And you just get such a sense of having been on this journey and really covered a load of ground.
And the moment when you see the Lambda logo on the big doors before you enter the Lambda Labs, and then when you go in there, there's a bunch of experimental weaponry and you're being sort of teed up to go off into Zen. But yeah, just sort of looking at that big door, you realize everything that's happened to you and what an incredible journey it's been. And how many distinct areas and environments and set pieces and scenarios you can remember between beginning your perfectly normal day at Black Mesa and arriving here at the Lambda Labs.
It always just really hammers home to me, like what an incredible journey it takes you on. And so that's why that's number five for me. I don't know what your thoughts are, Jeremy, on the Lambda Labs in particular.
Yeah, well, I mentioned to you the other day, didn't I? I was just kind of reaching the Lambda Labs section in my current play through. And there was a great bit of dialogue I hadn't remembered where one of the scientists says to Gordon, you're not supposed to know about this lab, but then again, I can see that already, you know more than any one man is supposed to.
And there's tons of great lines like that in Half-Life. And yet it's mostly not about dialogue. I interviewed Mark Laidlaw quite recently, the writer of Half-Life.
I mean, he'd be the first person to say he shouldn't be credited with all the storytelling in Half-Life, it's a collaborative effort. But I think one of his great strengths is that unlike so many writers entering the games industry before him, he was a novelist, but he recognized that level design was storytelling. And that worked with all the level designers on all these sequences.
You get those moments in Half-Life where you're crawling through a vent and then you hear soldiers mumbling in the room below you. And it becomes apparent they've heard you. And suddenly there's shafts of light appearing in that vent as they shoot up at you.
And then the vent collapses down to the ground. And suddenly you're in a firefight in a garage. And you're in a completely different space than you were 10 seconds earlier.
And it was all continuous. And you never lost control of the character. And you're in the middle of this incredible action story.
And those are the exact things that Half-Life introduced that just weren't a part of games or certainly first-person shooters before it came along. And it is storytelling, even though it is about a guy who doesn't speak, moving between different action sequences. And the premise is a fairly sort of classic, you know, American paranoia of federal government intervention type thing where there is secret experiments and they go wrong.
And then there's a violent cover-up by the state. And you have this sort of G-Man who's a sort of weird FBI type figure who doesn't seem to be from this planet. And, you know, none of that is spectacularly new, but it's the way it's weaved together, isn't it?
So David Jenkins, Nick Cohen, that's what I meant.
All that time ago, that's what I meant. And number four, I've referenced this on a previous podcast as well. It's the Barneys in the elevator, right at the beginning of the game, just after you've inadvertently opened up the interdimensional rift, when you've thrown the test sample into that big reactor.
It's all going to shit everywhere. The Barneys are just dying left, right and center. One gets sort of cut in half by a laser and then jibs fly everywhere.
And you're like, you know, I was 13, I was younger than the censors were intending for people to play it. And I was sort of quite traumatized by all this happening. I felt real sense of like personal responsibility.
I did this experiment. Maybe there was a way to not, you know, just like do the experiment properly.
Yeah, just have a normal day at work and go home.
Yeah, yeah, I would have loved that game. And again, I didn't know the rules in video games. I didn't know what was possible.
So I felt a real sense of culpability for all the violence I was seeing before me. And it really came to a head in that one particular scene where you press an elevator button and then you hear some barnies like stuck in the elevator. And because you've pressed the button, it now like, it starts to descend, but then like the cord, the cable is cut and then it like, it plummets down to the bottom of the shaft and they both die.
And Jesus, I just stood there like open mouthed, unable to deal with the guilt of what I'd done, reloaded it. I tried probably 10 times to save those barnies. I thought there was something I was doing wrong.
I thought the game was giving me like, you know, negative feedback for my actions and trying to modify whatever I was doing. And I tried and tried and tried, but it was obviously just a tiny little throw away bit of slapstick that completely derailed my playthrough. But I think that moment specifically is emblematic of the feeling of like absolute chaos and the cinematic spectacle with which that chaos is conveyed.
It was something that like 90s action movies were always doing as well. Like just throwing in some really grisly and dramatic deaths just for a bit of effect, just to get your heart rate up a little bit. Like, why does that guy on Titanic have to fall and like sort of crack in half on the big-
Yeah, it's a characteristic of disaster movies, isn't it? Whether you're watching 2012 or one of those where there's always like somebody in the car who gets smashed up by a big wave or you just, yeah. They are almost like little punch lines, aren't they?
And that's the way they are in Half-Life. It's these kind of disturbing slapstick moments where a scientist gets pulled into a vent and then giblets get kind of flushed out the other way.
I didn't like that either. I always felt like there was some, you know, if I got there quicker, I could press use and like pull him back out and then I'd have a Barney helping me. I'd love that mod.
I wish there was a mod that was just like a one-to-one recreation of Half-Life, but you could save every Barney and you sort of collect them. You know, a bit like Tom Francis did with the gnome in Half-Life 2. Just taking it all the way through like with him.
You could do that with every staff member of Black Mesa. So by the end, like you've got probably three or 400 NPCs following you around every way, bumping into each other and just going, oh dear, oh dear. So that's my number four is the Barneys in the elevator.
Number three is Forget About Freeman. The level, but also like the narrative beat. I don't know what's going on with my voice.
It's just giving up on me. But yeah, that narrative beat, that twist feels like quite unprecedented, quite new to me for the time that like, okay, we've established who the adversaries are in this game. You're fighting all these aliens.
The idea that then despite your best efforts to survive and you've been sort of fighting back the aliens yourself, this other, this new hostile force comes in that does not care about you and your endeavors at all. And it's just like sweeping the whole thing clean. I can't think of a game that did anything like that before.
Yeah, movies were full of that sort of twist, but for a game to do that, and then just after probably two or I want to say two hours before you start fighting the marines, right? To introduce this like a major component of the game. Oh, it's just mind-blowing again, you know, when you're 13.
And the objective up till that point has been to, you know, make contact with the authorities, you know, make people aware what's going on and survive. And hopefully we will sort this out together. And then to discover that you're not part of the solution, but part of what needs to be wiped away is quite shocking.
Yeah, absolutely. And then of course, like, it's a great showcase for the AI, those soldiers at the time, the way that they worked together and communicated what they were doing and would flush you out with grenades, would flank you.
It still stands up that, doesn't it? Like there isn't, for whatever reason, whether it's because, you know, shooters became driven by cover systems and enemies who hung back. It's still, I still find myself surprised by the soldiers in Half-Life appearing at my flanks and, you know, darting around in ways that AI doesn't seem to do in shooters now.
Properly menacing. Yeah, you can never relax with them. And because they're so, like, they're so ubiquitous from that point where, in which they're, I've just realised I'm not, I'm not thinking about Forget About Freeman.
I'm thinking about We've Got Hostiles.
That's it, yeah. Yeah, that's the one.
Well, let's salvage that. I think we can salvage that because also Forget About Freeman is another fantasy. Like it's a twist on the twist.
So just to be clear, originally I'm being an idiot and I'm talking about We've Got Hostiles, the moment where the marines are introduced, which you were probably shouting at us for the last sort of five to 10 minutes, but that wasn't the right level now. However-
Forget About Freeman is when the marines give up, right? That's when the-
Yeah, which is like a twist on a twist. Yeah. Like, again, I just can't really fit, I suppose Gears of War has done similar stuff like this, but not with the same impact.
But just at the point where like, all right, we've established the marines now, and we've even built on it with those assassins, and the marines have been getting more vicious. They've started laying traps with the trip mines everywhere, and we're used to seeing these three-way fights between the marines, the aliens and yourself, and you can just sort of sit back and watch those. That's a major component of the game.
And now the next thing, like, narratively, it feels huge that they're giving up, and you feel like either you've won or your plight is so hopeless against the aliens that even the marines have given up, so you've completely lost. It feels like a weird Pyrrhic victory that after fighting the marines for so long, they've declared the fight unwinnable. What does that mean for you?
Yeah. And again, other than maybe the Gears series, which has one of those sort of twists every hour or so, I can't really think of games doing that, certainly to the same degree of effectiveness. So number three is we've got hostiles slash forget about Freeman, the double twist.
The plot arc of the marines in general is I guess what I was thinking of there. It was probably about 7.30 in the morning when I wrote that list. Number two is the Tentacle Beast.
And I think this is the defining moment of Half-Life to me, mainly because I was stuck on it for several weeks, like weeks at a time trying to figure out, because it took me days to really accept that I couldn't just shoot it to death. And I thought maybe, all right, I can't shoot it. Maybe it's grenades then.
Maybe if I just keep launching the grenades for my SMG, and then all the grenades that I've got, the frag grenades, and then probably there's somewhere else where I can find more grenades. So I tried that approach for a long time, just throwing all the explosives I could. And then by the time it finally twigged, no, it's this sort of like platforming puzzle really, where you have to descend levels without the tentacle beast hearing you and then impaling you on its massive beaks.
Working your way down to basically get an enormous like, it's like a rocket. What even is it that it's living in? It's living in like a nuclear missile silo.
It is living in a silo, yeah, like what you would launch a rocket from, but this weird, enormous tentacle beast has taken residence in it, like in the center, doesn't it? Yeah.
So yeah, so you have to like make it to a minimum three, maybe four distinct areas that are sort of like sublevels within the tentacle beast's domain. Bring all that sort of power back online, get the fuel rigs back live, and then finally you make it back to the sort of main console room that you began the level on hours ago, or in my case, weeks and weeks ago, and you just get to press the button and absolutely obliterate this thing.
Yeah, it's an incredible sequence and learning to understand the monster is a really interesting sort of like, it's like a kind of gaming anthropology and you understand there's some kind of behaviour governing it that's unique and to get past it, you want to try and not make too much noise moving yourself, also you can use grenades to make noise, if you want to redirect it. Also, you can, you know, if you think you're close to a door, you can sort of dart to it quickly because it can't respond to you that quickly. It has to turn itself.
So you're not using this combination of things and knowledge of this creature to get the better of it, which is definitely unprecedented in the FPS genre at the time.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, like, if we compare it, you know, not to throw shade at Quake, but like, let's compare it directly to, like, that final boss battle. That was only two years previously.
In the same, you know, basically the same game engine, right? Like, you know, it's Gold Source. It's a really highly modified version of that, of the Quake 1's engine.
The, like, the level of complexity around that boss encounter is, like, they don't, there's no contest, is there? Yeah, and just great at, like, completely modifying your behavior. Up to that point, you're quite a gung-ho run-and-gun sort of research scientist.
Like, you know, the game usually rewards you for keeping moving. It's not really, like, a cover shoot-ery sort of thing. You, if you get into too much trouble, you can always just launch a grenade from your underbarrel of your SMG to clear an area, or just, like, maintaining a constant sprint and, like, alternate firing your shotgun for, like, a double burst.
Like, that will get you out of too much trouble. So you never really have to stop and think too much. The only thing that, you know, stops you in your tracks are the platforming puzzles.
And then at this point, it's like there's an enemy that makes you have to literally sort of cower and, like, inch along crouching without making a single sound. It's like, it's completely contrary to everything that you've been doing in the game. And to that point, so just a fantastic bit of design.
Visually, incredibly spectacular. It's like, it's a bit like Seymour, like the plant from The Little Shop of Horrors, isn't it? It's like a big Seymour.
But with beaks.
It evolved in the ideal ecology of Xen, presumably. For that specific guy.
Yeah. And when you finally, you've beaten it, and then you like jump down through that silo hole, to me, that point onwards was like Half-Life 2, because I just spent so long stuck on it. It was a dream.
It was a wild fantasy to be able to hop down that hole and into whatever lay beyond that moment. So yeah, that's my moment number two. The best bit, absolutely and incontrovertibly, is the opening hour or so in my mind.
It's the efficiency of world building and the size of the world that it builds with actually quite a small number of assets and scenes is absolutely staggering. It begins with that train ride where you see things that you're introduced to the G-Man, you're introduced to Barney, you're introduced to the Black Mesa aesthetic, the design language of that entire facility is established really well five minutes. What's the name of the fucking security guard?
Barney.
Are they all Barneys?
Yeah. I don't think they're any of the names established.
I don't know. I don't know why this happens to me when I'm recording podcasts. I feel like that you know that news reporter who did the word salad?
I think she was reporting on maybe the Oscars?
Yeah.
And she's just like, well, a very heavy, hairy, blurted, catheter-controlled graphene-stimulated, beloved object.
Well, a very, very heavy vertation tonight. We had a very deris-derisen bite and let's go to terris-terisen to have the pet.
That happens to me sort of every...
There is something about recording that does that to you, isn't there?
Yeah, about every 20 minutes. Anyway, so, yes, you're introduced to the Barneys and everything else very efficiently on that train ride. But then, even beyond that, what's my favourite thing about it, it's just like the conceit that you're just having a normal day at work.
I really enjoyed that for some reason. And being able to like mess around with like one of the scientists lunches in the microwave and blow it up or like just keep pressing the button on the vending machine to all the cans in the canteen like just go all over the floor. I don't know, it just scratches my lizard brain in a weird way that makes me full of joy.
And it tees up that moment, the moment where everything changes so well. There's, the pacing is just absolutely perfect. And like in the, in the hero's journey, right, Joseph Campbell's hero's journey, like it's a really like sort of classic and, no, let me just Google it.
I'm editing the Half-Life bit anyway, so.
I'm making a problem only for myself. Oh, I see how it is. Past Phil, you just sit there Googling stuff that you can't remember, leave it all for future Phil to worry about.
Is that it? Well, do you know what? No.
No, not this time. Everyone's just going to have to sit there and listen. They're going to have to listen to you not being able to remember something quite basic about narrative theory.
And do you know what else? You've been getting loads of Half-Life stuff wrong this episode and it's really annoying to listen back to. Calling things Barneys that aren't Barneys, getting the levels wrong.
Have you ever played Half-Life? Honestly, you would better buck your ideas up in the back half of this thing. Otherwise, I don't know what I'm going to do.
So you better start getting funny and accurate. Back to the show. Yes, right.
The Hero's Journey, you like, it begins with this call to adventure which is just sort of Gordon Freeman, like, you know, they're waiting for him in the test chamber, famously. Like, he's got to do this experiment today. You hear, like, bits and bobs through some of the other scientists that, like, there's something a bit significant about this particular experiment.
Something might go wrong. Some of them seem a little bit worried about it.
They're being rushed, aren't they? They're being, like, they're rushed into performing an experiment by upper management. They don't feel quite prepared for it.
They're using settings that maybe it's got a sort of Chernobyl-esque feel to it.
Yeah. And so what happens next in that hero's journey, classically, is you cross the threshold and that begins the adventure. I can't think of a more literal and classic and way of crossing the threshold than literally opening up an interdimensional portal and actually seeing what lies beyond that threshold and those flashes.
Once everything goes wrong and things start exploding in the test chamber, then you're briefly teleported out to Nihilanth and surrounded by vortigaunts momentarily thinking you're about to die and then you're teleported back. It's a great way of crossing the threshold and then everything that lies beyond that game, that moment is chaos and violence and anarchy and life is incredibly cheap. If a Barney dropped down dead in front of you, just on your way from the train to the front desk, it would be horrific.
You'd be like, oh my god, what's happened? But after you've crossed the threshold, life becomes incredibly cheap and you just used to seeing jibs everywhere and every NPC that follows you for a bit, you know their days are numbered and you're going to see them explode in viscera before too long.
Yeah, it's the contrast, isn't it, that makes it so effective, the juxtaposition between the sort of mundane corporate office life, which, you know, I can't help but wonder whether the experience of Gabe Newell and others at Microsoft fed into that idea of just kind of being a very small cog in this enormous well-paid machine. yeah, to have that sort of come apart is absolutely terrifying. It's the kind of like, it's the kind of thing I associate with a Dishonored or something from Arkane these days, where you have like, it's not just all hostile areas, you have these sort of grey spaces where nothing has kicked off, but it feels like it might.
And yeah, it's a really, really special kind of grounding technique. And it was really smart of them to think to do that. They had all these ruin levels and they had the master stroke of oh, let's just un-ruin them make it look like it would have done before this kicked off and had this whole intro sequence preceding the experiment.
I'm still frustrated that games don't do that more or they don't commit to it for slightly longer. Deus Ex Human Revolution has a really similar opening where everything's fine in this really futuristic laboratory for about seven minutes. I would have liked to have spent a bit more time living the normal life and just getting a feel for what the world is like in this near future before everything goes to shit.
I think it's so valuable, it's so grounding, but I can understand why games don't... You can't implement much action at all until everything goes wrong. But I think games can trust us a little bit more to hold our attention to stick around long enough for them to ground us in the world for an hour or so before we start picking up guns and shooting everything back to normal, you know?
I think a lot of games mimicked this intro afterwards, right? But they maybe didn't quite get it a lot of the time. They thought, oh, it's about being on a train and watching things.
I was like, no, that's sort of a, you know, that's part of the picture. The point is that it's... You're being grounded in what feels like a real world and that's maintained throughout Half-Life, so that you're getting a cross-section of what feels like a real world that always follows, you know, its own rules, so that it transcends being in these set of corridors, even though you know that's what you're in.
It always feels like you're just seeing part of a whole.
Exactly. So, difficult job to try and boil down Half-Life into five defining moments because it's... I mean, even within those five moments that I've mentioned, there are probably five moments, you know, within each that I can talk about and that feel distinct and are quite memorable.
It's the absolute master of making memories and making you feel like you're going on a journey and that there's meaning to every new area that you reach. But that's the best moments, anyway. And then let's have another little musical interlude and then Jeremy, I've also prepared my favourite sounds from Half-Life.
I've done a slightly different approach to you, but I think that'll be quite fun. So in a second, let's get into that, shall we?
Looking forward to it.
Cool, well, let's do it immediately then. So, whereas, so there will still be 10 points on offer for you. So just to recap in the Quake half of this episode, Phil got 7 out of a possible 10 points.
Not bad at all.
You will also have a maximum of 10 for, if you will get 2 points for guessing the Phil version, you will get 1 point for correctly identifying the actual in-game sample version. So, yeah. But however, what I've done is that I've recorded my Phil versions.
So I'm not going to be able to do it live for you because I've sort of like layered sounds on each other to try and get them as close as possible.
I mean, that's going to make it easier for me, isn't it? You just kind of got raw mouth noise.
Yeah, I've created collages. Think of me as a sculptor of virtual places and things. And yeah, I'm like a human mixing desk that's just like really gone into the granularity of each of each noise and like we created it absolutely authentically as much as possible, even some quite complex sounds.
So with that in mind, Jeremy, here is your first sound. More in that, Freeman.
He does not straight the sound effect, is it? Let's say guys, more in that, Freeman. That's Barney.
That's Barney. I just went into the minute details of this game and just recreated every facet that I could find from the audio. No, that's a joke one.
Very good. That's just a little warm up, you know? I just wanted to test that I could do it.
I just wanted to know in my heart that I could make the Barney noise if I wanted to. So, yes, next is the proper one. Okay, so this is the proper first sound of the test.
This is Half-Life sound effect 1.
All voice for a sort of male three-part acapella. And that's a very good version of the... Oh no, which charging station is it?
I think they probably sound the same. It's the health charging station, right? Rather than the HEV suit.
It is the health charging station. Yes, you're correct.
Yeah, that's great. Such a distinct collection of noises.
So yeah, the charging station does sound pretty similar. But you are correct in identifying the... That's the health charger.
So well done. That's two points for you, for anyone playing at.
See, they're quite close.
Oh yeah. I feel better already having heard that. And that's topped me right up.
You'd be lucky to be able to charge for that long, wouldn't you, in-game? It always seems to run out a little before that.
Yeah, you're always at like 87 and about 30 in the HEV suit. Yeah. So you're two for two, having correctly identified the Phil version of Half-Life Sound 1.
Here is Half-Life Sound 2.
What noise is that? That's great. I don't know what these little guys are called, but they're the dog-like enemies who let off a little shockwave if you let them get too close to you and build up as you've beautifully performed here.
A little sort of charge up phase, and they sort of yip away, and then they unleash a little shockwave. They're sort of dog-like, but they're also like, they don't have faces, do they?
They're called the Houndeyes. That's their official name. I think I went by some, I used to call them something else because I think in PC Gamer's review of it, they called them something like the Sonic Dogs or something that's, you know, off-brand.
So I always knew them as that, but apparently, yeah, the official name is the Houndeye. So you're four for four. I've been, if anything, too helpful at this.
I think you have, yeah.
Really stitched myself up. But let's listen to the real version of the Houndeye. Take it away, Houndeyes.
It sounds like Formula One when you hear it all back to back like that. Quite overwhelming.
Alarming noises.
All right, so a perfect score so far. Let's move on to Half-Life Sound 3. I think this one's a little bit more difficult.
Here's the Phil version.
Bang.
I think the end part is definitely the biggest clue there.
Oh, I think it is your favorite tentacle monster. It is the tentacle beast. It's sort of like listening in dormant phases.
Yes.
Hammering its beaks against the metal platforms of the missile silo in which it lives.
That's exactly it. Yes, well done. So, you are now 6 for 6, Jeremy.
Oh, man. I think I did, dude. Your extra work is my gain, truly.
Okay, let's hear the real life version of the tentacle sounds.
Sort of sounds like a low-voiced whale, and then a load of metal things fallen out of a big bag.
I had a moment in the middle of that where I thought, what are we doing? What even is our job? This is such a strange thing to be listening to.
Well, think of me having to record it. That was my Sunday morning, I was going, did that sound good enough? Do I need to do it again?
A strange thing that we do, isn't it? Anyway, let's not bog ourselves down in that reality. You're six for six here, Jeremy.
You're on for the perfect game. The stakes are incredibly high. We're going into sound four.
I think this is my personal favorite. I'm incredibly proud of this. It's a really specific sound.
Oh, but God, I'm just really pleased with it. Just really pleased. Let's hear it.
Oh, that's a great noise. I can't quite place it yet.
What noise is that? What noise is that?
I'm going to hear it again.
Is the noise that you're hearing is being generated not by an enemy, but by you or part of your arsenal. I don't know. I think I'm going to have to hear the actual effect, see if that chokes my memory.
Okay. Well, the file name gives it away what it is, so.
I can see that, says the Tao Cannon. But I don't think I would have got it. I don't think I would have got it, man.
I clearly haven't used it enough.
Well, that's actually my point with those. All of those later energy-based weapons, like the experimental weapons, I never fucking used them, because you just always think, oh, I'll save that until there's a real imperative to use it, because this is obviously a serious weapon.
Yeah, and you don't have a lot of ammo either.
Yeah, so you just take it to your grave. You just pick it up, never use it, keep on using the shotgun and the SMG, and then like this, basically that's the Tau Cannon, aka the Gauss Gun.
I have used it, I have used it, but yeah, I wouldn't have.
Yeah.
Kind of a rare enough occurrence. It was a great impression though.
I also don't think I've ever killed anything in Half-Life with those little, what are they called? No, no, no, no, no, you don't. No more getting Half-Life wrong.
Goodness sake, this is supposed to be your favorite game. You are on thin ice, Iwanyuk. If you don't come up with the name of these things that you're thinking of, so help me.
You little sort of like cretins that you...
Oh, you little bugs, you sort of throw them and they run towards the enemy and they explode, which sounds like that's an easy kill, but it never quite works out the way it does.
Snarks, they're called. Good! I quite like to just get them out and watch them wriggle around in my hand for a bit, but if you need to take something down, they're just pretty useless.
So, in fact, you can no longer get the perfect score, but you can still beat me. If you correctly identify this final noise, you will be on 8 out of the total possible 10 points, thereby taking the entire plaudits, spoils, prizes and everything else. With that in mind, Jeremy, are you ready to hear Half-Life Sound 5?
Come on, let's do it.
Here we go.
Oh, wow. It's like a machine noise, it's like a sort of utility noise. I'm going to hear that again.
It's over in a flash.
You're thinking along the right lines, yeah.
I feel like I'm hitting E or something, like I'm just pressing some kind of key.
Yeah, I'm giving you that. When you hit E and something.
Works, then that noise is like when you actually open a door or something. That's a successful use of the use button, basically. Very satisfying.
I'll give you that. That's 8 out of 10 points. Jeremy, you've taken the entire quiz.
You've done it. Quake is the better game.
I would like to thank the hound dogs, wherever they are today.
Let's play that sound effect just for anybody playing along at home. And there it was. So good.
So that's why Half-Life is so good anyway, because it's got those five noises in it. And also some levels whose names that I can't remember that are good, because things happen in them that are good. I guess this is a bit where we get into the nitty-gritty of the game and why it's good.
What I wanted to do is actually talk about the mods that came out of this, because aside from the game itself, it's famous for having birthed some of the biggest multiplayer IPs of all time. I'd say top of that list is probably CS GO, because it's still going or soon to be Counter Strike 2 in the latest version of Source Engine. That all came about as a mod that released in very early alphas in 1999 and then a 1.0 in 2000.
So little of it has changed since. People are still playing Dust 2 23 years later. That's pretty incredible.
A lot of the weapon sound effects in Counter Strike up to 1.6, it's all the Half-Life sound effects. You press use, you still get a... So that's great.
That's a cool bit of lineage. Team Fortress 2 is also... You can trace that all the way back to...
Interestingly, given this podcast, you can trace it all the way back to Quake 1.
That's our answer. Quake is the best game. Yeah, that's true.
It was sort of brought up, wasn't it?
So, Team Fortress was originally a very popular class-based team deathmatch mod for Quake 1. Valve brought it up. I think there was a Quake 2 version of Team Fortress.
Maybe.
I might be making that up, but there was certainly Team Fortress Classic, which was the Half-Life iteration of that game. I played a lot of that. That was maybe the first multiplayer game that I properly got into.
I remember becoming friends with a guy who used to make metal songs out of MIDI. We'd spend a match. He would teach me how to be a good heavy, and then he would send me this MIDI file.
Man. And then, of course, being part of Val's property, Team Fortress 2 was going to arrive in about 2001-ish, and then just kept slipping, kept slipping, kept slipping, and then released as part of the Orange Box and blew everyone's minds. And we can all thank Half-Life for the Orange Box.
Yeah, I'd imagine Hero Shooters like Overwatch without Team Fortress, I would say.
Exactly. But don't hold that against it because Team Fortress was a good game in its own right. But I was super into a lot of the single player mods, and I remember in particular my favourite was They Hunger.
Did you ever play these?
No, I heard of this one though.
Yeah, so it was released on the PC Gamer demo discs. I think it might have been PC Gamer US that sort of bankrolled this project somehow. It was a sort of episodic retelling of the Romero-style zombie movies.
Yeah, the other Romero. Yes, exactly. Very pulp fiction-y, but a really impressive total conversion.
The pistol had the same sound effects, but was reskinned. I think all of the weapons were reskinned. The zombies sounded the same, moved the same, behaved the same, but were slightly reskinned.
I remember the very beginning of the first They Hunger. The zombies actually do pull it like you end up in probably enough, like, crashing in a cemetery. Yeah, and the zombies are popping up out of the ground, which I thought was super cool at the time, and something that didn't really...
The zombies burst out of the walls in Half-Life, but they didn't emerge from the ground, rising from their graves. It was great, a great atmosphere piece, as always, for something that I want to talk about. It really nailed the tone of those sort of 70s Romero zombie horror.
Super good, but there was an entire scene of... There was action Half-Life where you could sort of dual wield weapons. It was online multiplayer, but you could do all the John Woo, Blood Opera sort of stuff.
There was Day of Defeat, World War II, a team death match game. What else was there? There was a lot going on.
I'm trying to remember some of the other really good single player Half-Life mods. That noise that you can probably hear is me Googling them. Oh, USS Darkstar, of course.
Again, I have to thank PC Gamer UK magazine for putting all of these mods onto their demo discs because I just wasn't very internet literate, surprisingly enough, back in those days. So I didn't know where all these mods were popping up. I would never have been able to sort of find them and curate them.
But they would pop up in a special section quite regularly on PC Gamer demo discs. And I would dutifully play them all. And there were some absolute belters in there.
And yeah, USS Darkstar was a really good one. Lambda Wars was a good one. In fact, Gunman Chronicles, do you remember that?
That began as just a completely amateur Half-Life mod. I mean, there are so many. I'm looking through a big list of them here.
Azure Sheep was quite a quite a popular one at the time. But I would say I Wanted as well. Wanted was a great.
It was a super janky Wild West multiplayer game. You sort of like dueling pistols. Yeah, they hunger was, in my opinion, the cream of the crop.
And I think there were like three different episodes. It lost its way towards the end slightly. But my goodness, that was good fun and like incredible value for money.
If you're a cash strapped 13, 14 year old boy, because the game just kept getting bigger with all this free stuff that kept appearing for it. And it became, I guess, a bit like what Minecraft or Roblox is now. It's like it became just a sort of a foundation or a base for all this multitude of different experiences.
Yeah. All these threads carrying into the future. Should we talk briefly about Black Mesa?
Because I know that that's... You have very mixed feelings about... I mean, for those who don't know, it's a kind of modern day remake of the original Half-Life.
It started as a sort of one for one-ish remake and over time kind of grew an ambition. And you can kind of see that like in the later segments, it becomes its own thing and sort of strays from the blueprint quite a bit. But, you know, it's acclaimed, it's well liked, but for you, it's not...
You're not so keen, are you?
Yeah, and this all began way back in... When was... When did this game...
When was Black Mesa... I think it was like 2012, 2013 when Black Mesa first started like picking up attention as this incredible Source Engine remake. And I thought, well brilliant, because I hadn't touched Half-Life, I've left it as this like sacred memory.
Hadn't touched it since I'd completed it back in 1999. And I thought this is the perfect opportunity and excuse to go back and replay it. So I downloaded it and I started playing it and I thought, oh, but that's slightly different.
And like the voice lines that the staff around Black Mesa have is just like a little bit different. And the layout was pretty much the same, but like the stuff on the walls was a bit different and it just wasn't giving me the nostalgia that I wanted. And I thought what I want, what I want really is to just play the original Half-Life.
That still exists. Nothing's going to give me the memories back like that original game. So I did that and that actually began this years long journey of rebuilding my first PC to play Half-Life on, which took a long time to source all the parts.
But yeah, I did that. And then that's how I want to play Half-Life really is to keep that memory absolutely sacrosanct. But then last year I thought, come on, grow up, Phil.
Actually just play Black Mesa on its own terms. I'm sure you'll still enjoy it. And truth be told, I did enjoy it.
I'm glad I played it. There are lots of cool additions. It's like, it's miraculous what they've done.
Like how well they've managed to translate the sense of place from that original game into the source engine. There are some really spectacular graphical scenes and effects. It does loads really, really well, but in the moments where it starts to diverge slightly from the source material, my teeth just set on edge and that happens more and more as time goes on.
And I think it is actually around Forget About Freeman where they really go off script and really extend certain sequences.
Yeah, and that's when Gordon has a dramatic monologue. He has a soliloquy, doesn't he? Eventually breaks into song.
I didn't like the musical. I know a lot of people love the musical number. I didn't like it.
It felt quite incongruous to me. And then, yeah, they re-did Zen completely. I mean, the famously bad...
I mean, we haven't even talked about it, have we? Like, that's how... It's like sort of a footnote in Half-Life's history.
They're like, there's some comfortable truth that it ends on a real downer because the back two or three hours of the game are in this, like, floaty alien world where it doesn't do anything like the same world building. It doesn't ground you in this, like, fascinating environment. It's just these disparate sort of bounce pads, aliens that you've fought before, except for the Gonarch.
That's pretty cool, the Gonarch fight.
I never hated it as much as is standard. I don't think, like, I, you know, I've always had a weakness with sort of first-person platforming that, you know, isn't always echoed among the general populace. I discovered that again when Doom Eternal came out and I thought it was an absolute blinder and some people couldn't stand the jumpy bits in between the fights.
And there's also, like, a cool element of Xen where, if I'm not mistaken, like, you come across bodies of other Gordons, right? There's some kind of, like, weird universal element that's quite creepy.
That's right, yeah.
Yeah, but, I mean, it's certainly not the best sequence in the game.
No, yeah, I guess I would agree that I did. I never really hated it. I wasn't really sophisticated enough to have an opinion on it either way.
I just didn't enjoy it as much as the stuff on Earth. However, yeah, Xen is really expanded and totally reworked in Black Mesa. And a lot of people really like the Gonarch fight now.
Interestingly, I'm not sure if I made this up. Did I make this up, Jeremy? Valve originally deliberately made the Gonarch look testicular to freak us out as players.
Because the idea was the average video game player at that time was like a teenage boy. That was the insight that the industry had. So they thought it would be very uncomfortable for teenage boys to be shooting this massive testicle.
Have I invented that?
If anybody has any insights on that, I've read that somewhere, maybe in a dream.
Is that the giant alien baby? Is this the boss we're talking about?
No, the gonarch is just like, it really does look like a testicle on four legs. It's like a giant headcrab with a big bollock in the middle. And it secretes other headcrabs as you're fighting it.
Well, it's true that the greatest fear of a teenage boy is being hit in the bollocks.
Very true. And it happens a lot. Like, it very rarely happens these days.
But when you're a teenager, it's almost a daily occurrence.
When I was a young teenager, there was a trend for little chains. You know, it was the era of New Metal. Everyone was wearing little chains on their jeans and stuff.
Not for any particular reason, just a sort of accessory. And I remember I'd be swinging that around and accidentally hit myself in the... What's the name of the boss again?
The Gonarchs.
Right, the Gonarchs.
Clocked it right in the Gonarchs. Yeah, let us know on Discord if I'm talking absolute breeze or whether there's something in that. I'm going to have to read about that afterwards.
I'm sure I read that somewhere. Anyway, do you know what, past Phil? I'm going to give you a pass on that because I've been doing some reading and the Gonarch was originally intended to resemble a giant testicle.
At Gabe Newell's behest, it was intended as a massive 20-foot spider with an enormous testicle hanging underneath it. So that bit is correct. The bit about homophobia relates to a different and cut enemy called Mr. Friendly, which was going to have an actual penis and kind of grab hold of you and display quite sexual behavior, which, for everyone's benefit, was eventually cut.
I can't help but notice that we've forgotten most of the segments that we usually put in the podcast, including the results of the previous Song Wars, reading out lovely feedback from Discord and basically everything else that we've ever done in previous episodes. So sorry about that. However, I do think that this last Review Wars is quite good.
So it almost makes up for the fact that this back half, the Half-Life episode has been an absolute shambles. So thanks for joining us on this journey. I can only apologize really and enjoy the last few minutes of it.
Black Crowbar Collective really have expanded those final missions. I would say Xen goes on for, I don't know, it felt like four hours to me. And I didn't like that because I didn't feel any sense of nostalgia anymore.
And because I played so many Half-Life mods, I felt like I was just playing another Half-Life mod, you know, like, just imagining what goes on on this alien world that I'm not very engaged with. I don't know. I'm glad it exists.
I'm really glad it exists. It's very impressive. They obviously understand Half-Life in ways that I don't and will never understand, right?
If they can recreate it so expertly in Source Engine, they are the experts and I'm not. So I absolutely have to preface my opinions and preferences with that. But yeah, for me, I think I just...
The purpose of playing an old classic game like that is to extract the maximum nostalgia and good memories out of it. And the original will always be the best at doing that for me. That's just my personal take on it.
And so the more that it went off the songbook and started riffing, the less I was enjoying it personally.
I think that's absolutely fair enough. Is it time for your review war, do you think?
Oh, God, I'd love to. I'm really pleased with this review war. I think this is going to probably wrap up this episode.
If anyone's still listening and alive at this point, what are we at, like 150 minutes plus? Then we're so glad that you've joined us on this journey. We hope that you have enjoyed it, not just this episode, but the entire series.
It's been an absolute blast. I've rarely been pleased with my review war contributions because I've, let's be honest, phoned them in quite often or I've just copied you, but a week later. This time, I have done that again, but I think I've done it to a really good effect.
I've copied something that you've done. There's a dodgy bit of looping that I can't help but hear every time I listen to it back, which I'm not pleased with. Otherwise, I like this.
And I'll tell you for why. What I've done is rather than write something myself, I've gone back and actually I read the original PC Gamer Review of Half-Life. This is where it all began for me.
This is why I had ended up working in the games industry, was because of this one issue of PC Gamer magazine. And this review was the first that I read and I read it again and again and again, every day for two weeks between picking up this magazine and Christmas time when I was going to be getting Half-Life. It was just like how I hyped myself up, the same way that you might rewatch the Starfield trailer every day.
This review was absolutely formative for me. It was Mark Donald's review of Half-Life in issue 63 of PC Gamer UK. That was the November 1998 issue.
So I thought I'd just use that and just read it out because I want to share that with everybody and just sprinkle a bit of Review Wars style music on the top of it. Just as a thank you to PC Gamer magazine and a thank you to Mark Donald and a celebration of why we even had the idea for Review War because we love the beginnings of 90s game reviews.
I feel like I should be calling you out for cheating, but I really like this idea and I'm looking forward to hearing it.
I found somewhere that has, not PDFs, but pretty decent photographs of each page of this review and if I remember I'll drop them in the Discord for everybody so that you can read along with this because it's a great little moment in time. So that explains this Review War. I hope everybody enjoys.
When passage through the shadowy corridors of the future publishing complex becomes fraught with the danger of entanglement in knots of seen-it-all journalists urgently and excitingly relating anecdotes to each other about things that happen to them in a game, you know you're dealing with a powerful force. That force is Half-Life, which is about all you'll have left by the time you've finished it. Since it's arrived through the ventilation system, the whole building has come down with Half-Life as if it's an airborne disease in a space suit.
It would not be alarmist to say that something akin to Half-Life fever has broken out, an infectious black death crossed with Chinese flu type strain whose symptoms include taking days off work, pulling down the blinds and pretending not to be in just to play it some more and then babbling uncontrollably about it whenever your doctor's note is exposed as an obvious forgery. Indeed, when Half-Life first turned up, Matt claimed he only had 24 hours to live and therefore had to play it all day. As such transparent behaviour indicates, the 3D shooter debate is no longer about Quake II vs Unreal.
Half-Life silences all dissent by being so utterly and resoundingly better than either of them that it's difficult to come to terms with. Attempting to do so can only lead to one conclusion.
So that's Review Wars this episode.
Amazing, I felt like we were at the end of PC Gaming, like we were at the encore of PC Gaming.
Yeah, like a seismic moment for PC Gaming. I love that bit, Half-Life is the best 3D gaming existence, that's in bold. It's its own paragraph and it's in bold in the copy.
I would never get through the subs today.
No, imagine that, handing that in. If I like, what was the last game I reviewed? I think it was The Last of Us.
If I was just like, yeah, just put that in bold. Say it's the best game that's ever been made.
That has to be in bold. If it's not in bold, don't use it and don't pay me.
So I thought that was sort of full circle, right? Like that first bit of review means a lot to me. And it felt like a nice celebratory tone to go out on.
Yeah. So thank you everyone for joining us.
The building has come down with Half-Life. It really captures the phenomenon, doesn't it?
Yeah.
As well as what the game actually is. It's beautiful.
It's what magazines we're so good at, is like putting you there in the office with everyone and making you feel like one of the team. Like, oh, you know, Matt's been pretending that he's been ill, or like, you know, it's been the talk of the office. You just feel like you're there with them and you're just one of the gang of friends.
So, yeah, good intro. I'm not sure about that first. The first sentence is pretty long.
A lot of clauses in that first sentence. I wonder if Mark Donald himself would have, in latter days, subbed that out. That would be interesting.
But, yeah, I mean, I guess that's it. That's quite a bit of content. Series done.
We'll be back like Fleabag with a new conceit to blow the world away with.
We would love to come up with a sexy vicar for a new series.
I think that's well within our wheelhouse. We've got a sexy vicar conceit in us. So, yeah, keep an eye peeled on the Discord or for Jeremy popping up as a conspicuous guest to talk about some new stuff that we're going to do.
Or maybe we'll be doing it as part of The Back Page in future. But thank you to everybody who's listened. We hope you've enjoyed.
Super encouraging the whole way along to have everyone pitching in with the feedback. It's been really good. We've really enjoyed it.
Absolutely. Yeah, it's meant a lot. I know I haven't been on the Discord an awful lot, but I have read it.
I have read all the nice stuff. I appreciate people taking their time out of their days to write nice things about something that we've made. That's been cool.
We will catch you in some future form. But until then, it's goodbye from me and it's goodbye from him.
Half-Life is such a good game. That is great.
Half-Life.
