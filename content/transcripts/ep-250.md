Hello and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how is the Bath Film Festival treating you so far? I saw you at one film on Friday, but you have seen many films. What state is your ass in after all that cinema seating for a week at this point?
It's okay, it's recovered. Those were the last films I saw on Friday, so I haven't seen any over the last two days, so my ass is fully recovered. I had a really, really stressful time watching If I Had Legs, I'd Kick You, which we'll obviously talk about in our Patreon episode when we go over everything we watched, but it was hugely anxiety-inducing, and that combined with sore ass was a real nightmare combo.
Yeah, that's tough, and yeah, excited to hear about Conan O'Brien, taking a dark turn in that. I always think of Conan O'Brien and Bob Odenkirk as my two closest comps to you. They're sort of like, combined the two of them, and I think you get some form of American Matthew Castle.
I think so, I kind of get, I think combined I sort of get that slight vibe from them. Do you think Conan O'Brien has a bit of a, you know, I mean, I guess because he was like, literally in the Simpsons writers' room, he has a little bit of a like magazine guy energy about him. You know what I mean?
Yeah, I get that. I was gonna say, I'm gonna combine the height of Conan O'Brien and the likelihood of an early heart attack of Bob Odenkirk.
Great. Well, nice of you to highlight the two strengths there. What a flattering portrayal of the two men.
Yeah. So this episode then, something a bit different, Steam Next Fest. I don't know how you feel about it, Matthew, but I've grown increasingly fond of it.
I think I used to see it as a bit of an attack in the sense that we've already all got too many games to play. Therefore, it's not helpful to have an event that's entirely about new games you haven't played yet and haven't bought yet, when your pile of shame is just staring at you of, I could be playing all these things I already paid money for but instead I'm playing this. But I don't know, I've sort of come to see it as a bit of a celebration of games and a way to get ahead slightly of what's coming next, which is useful for this podcast.
But in general as well, I think it brings the best out of all the different video game websites when everyone does their recommendations and stuff like that. What do you make of it?
This is the first time, not the first time I've interacted with it, but the deepest I've gone, or the most sort of concerted effort I made to actually sit down and engage with it and try and play a load of things and dig into it. I don't know if this is always true of Steam Next Fest or it's just the current iteration. I found it quite user unfriendly as an experience.
Like the actual using Steam to search and the way that it curated stuff and the way that it pushed stuff, it actually took me longer than I would hope to dig through. A certain top layer that it seemed absolutely determined to serve me no matter what I was trying to achieve. It was like always Reanimal and Cairn, Reanimal and Cairn, and I was just like, no, I don't want to fucking play Reanimal and Cairn.
I want something else, something a bit different. So I started going into like tags and such, and then I don't know who's tagging these games, whether it's the developers, the publishers, just some kind of like AI behind the scenes thing, but just wrong, just absolutely wrong all the time. Visual novels being served up as platformers, horror games in cozy game categories, just a huge, huge mess, but I don't know if it's been like that for a long time.
So it was kind of a two pronged thing, you know, one, enjoying trying all these games for once, but at the same time getting quite frustrated with, this is the official gaming store of PC gaming, and it's fucking rubbish.
This is sort of like a classics Valve thing, where it doesn't totally work, but it just goes on anyway, which is sort of like some parts of Steam feel like that. Yeah, I agree. I think the good thing it does is that if you have any game wishlisted, it does surface those to the very top of the Nixfest page.
So yes, I did see Cairn up there, and also another game that ended up being in my duds list, actually being removed from my wishlist. That's a tough break for that game. But it seemed to be obsessed with the idea that I'm a big shmup guy.
It was serving me loads and loads of shmups. And I don't know if I've ever really played a shmup on Steam. So I don't know where it got that from, but it meant that every time I went to that Nixfest page, it was like, oh, you know, we think you like shoot-em-ups, and here's loads of shoot-em-ups.
And some of them had the ropiest little kind of box art or slash marketplace art I've ever seen. And some of them were genuinely good. But in general, I just found it a bit baffling until I went to the, I think everyone does the same thing of going to the charts to see what are other people playing and then just scrolling down and down and down until you see what's there.
And then kind of giving up and going to the different websites that have covered the Steve Nixfest demos and saying, oh, what did they play? What did they pull out? So, yeah, but I will say that the range of demos is very generous.
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if there are 30, 40 things that are well worth playing in there. I didn't even get to all the things I wanted to play. But I've got more important things to do, like continuing my playthrough of Final Fantasy XIII.
Oh, God. So I can't go back to any demos, unfortunately. But I did play about, I think, six hours worth for this podcast in total.
So, you know, I feel like I did my homework for it and discovered a few new cool games off the back of it. And, yeah, in general, I just find it quite an interesting way for anyone out there to interact with, you know, the sort of like, I guess, like the future of indie games, the near future of indie games to see what's coming up and yeah, see what might be significant. A big thing for me, actually, was that blueprints demo really seemed to be a big deal for that game and getting on people's radars.
And that's when I thought, oh, maybe I should spend a bit more time getting into next first, you know. So, right, that's been on my mind a little bit. But after this experience, would you would you do this again?
Or was this just too stressful?
Yeah, probably. Though again, with the help of other people who are putting in the time to help kind of curate it for me, you know, it almost needs to be like a week longer, two weeks. Let people do the discovery for a week and then enjoy the fruits of their labors for the second week.
Because by the time people have picked things out, like in this episode, for example, it's over and you can't make use of any. And you can, you can obviously wish this to them and you can look forward to playing those games and I guess that's what the exercise of this episode is. But in terms of being able to actually enjoy them in the moment, it's a week or eight days or whatever it is, seems a little stingy.
I agree with that.
I also wonder if there's a little bit of, in the same way that I felt like the store was pushing me towards certain things, I don't know how much it did actually expose me to things that I hadn't heard of at all, and whether I was actually just playing lots of stuff, which I was already sort of aware of, and so you end up kind of grouping around known quantities, I guess. In the same way, that is the same beef I have with like, is it the IGF Awards, where I feel like it's the five indie games everyone's already heard of, and then they just get like amplified through the judge, like all the judges go in knowing the things that they want to play, and the chance of like a true discovery, it feels quite low. So I did go out my way to try and play some things which I just, I'd never heard of, and it was hit and miss doing that, I must admit.
Like there's a reason certain things already have a bit of kind of like, buzz around them, it's because they're pretty good, and there are some things that have no buzz, because they're not at all good, so.
Yeah, I mean, it definitely feels like the, you know, the chosen few end up being the winners. I imagine that it's a bit like the gaming market more generally, that if you're in that top 5%, then Steam Next Fest is a rousing success, and then for everyone else, it's kind of like a, well, you know, well shoot, never mind, we'll keep trying, or we didn't do everything we needed to, to make this a success. I had a lunch with someone a few months ago actually, he told me that they tell developers, they like do publishing consulting, that if you can't create like a marketing ramp up to your Steam Next Fest demo, don't do Steam Next Fest because your game will just get lost in the shuffle.
Like if it's not on anyone's radars, you're basically just sending out to die. It's actual function as a discovery platform is probably more limited than it seems. It's probably more limited versus the number of games on there than you'd really hope.
But I suppose like, what you say is that they should be two weeks long. I agree with you, because I'm, you know, you and I, we've got to be some of the more engaged people who play games. And if we're, you know, we're only really finding time to check out like 10 demos in a week or whatever, and we're doing it deliberately for a podcast episode, what chance does like a normie have?
You know what I mean? Like when, how deep are they gonna go? How many games are they actually gonna play?
So-
Normie Fest, rebrand it.
Well, I don't think there's any obligation for them to remove the demos once Steam Next Fest is over. So, I think that people can keep them around, you know?
I think a lot of the demos are on there before Next Fest as well. I think there's a little bit of like gaming it going on. I don't know how many people are actually, you know, sticking purely to those, you know, weeks within.
And, you know, I think it was, I was reading on PC Gamer. They were doing like a rundown of like the top 20 games in the charts, you know, a few days ago. I think it's changed since then.
The number one demo is a demo which has been on Steam since May. You know, it's not even a new thing that's sort of dominating the conversation. But, you know, I don't know.
Maybe that feels a little bit like, you know, nitpicking. You know, it's a good opportunity and thousands more people are going to be clicking on that Next Fest store promotion and actively looking for demos than they are at other times of the year. So it's probably a net gain, isn't it?
Yeah, it still doesn't get as much prominence on the Steam home page as the Warner Brothers sale, for example. But hey, I guess selling copies of Lego Batman 3 beyond Gotham probably more important than people checking these demos out.
Or like you can buy 20 Mortal Combats for 99p. You're like, yes, I do want some terrible PS2 era Mortal Combats.
Yeah, so I sort of I'm pro it generally, but it's sort of like I think to navigate it is it takes quite a lot of work and to get something out of it does require you to properly engage with it. So yeah, but I'm hoping for the purposes of our listeners that they get, you know, some interesting recommendations they might not have checked out or just little previews of things they're already curious about. I think your list has more things they wouldn't have heard of on it.
But that's okay.
Yeah, I mean, I'm less sure of a lot of them as well though.
Well, yeah, I think that's, they're not like all recommendations as such. I would say that most of mine are recommendations. We've got some duds, we're saving for the end, spoiler alert.
But I would say that probably out of the, I think I've got eight there. I think probably six or seven of them are like outright recommendations. So they're at least worth putting on your wishlist and seeing if it, you know, see what the reviews are like, seeing what the reception is like.
So Matthew, should we kick off with one of the really obvious ones?
Yeah, let's do it.
OK, so Reanimal is first up. Yes, it was on my wishlist. Yes, I picked it in the fantasy draft that we do at the beginning of the year.
And yes, it was delayed out of the year, so it cannot score points this year. And stops me from beating Matthew outright in that competition.
God bless you, Tarsier.
Obviously, I believe in taking the time to get these games right. But this is the developer of Little Nightmares 1 and 2. The third one, of course, was done by the Until Dawn Studio Supermassive.
Came out very recently and didn't seem to be, like, you know, beloved. Maybe it's just had its day as a series. But I would say this game is in a similar vein.
You can play it in co-op. You've got two little guys going around in a creepy world where there's lots of big freaky guys who are chasing you down, searching for you and such. And much like Little Nightmares, there's a whiff of the old inside.
And what was the other game they did, Matthew?
Limbo?
Limbo, yes. So, yes, a bit of Playdead DNA to it, for sure. But I would say that with Little Nightmares, they established their own sort of like, I guess, like Scandi-infused odd horror, you know?
There was a bit of their own identity to it, for sure.
Yeah.
And, you know, Playdead has been missing in action as a studio for like nine years, so we haven't seen the new game from that studio yet. And here they are, Matthew Castle values productivity, and this is a studio out there doing it. The actual like animal bit of it, I can't remember how that really features into it.
You got these little dudes wear these little masks, they're like animal masks. But so far, I've only really encountered like strange, dark stuff, like these very large kind of like dummy like men who sort of chase you around. But I would say that if someone told me this was a little nightmares game, I wouldn't have thought twice about it.
Because visually, it's pretty similar. And even if the setting is like, you know, just, it's something they haven't done before. It really just amounts to, you know, like a gloomy valley and you know, like some dark train tracks and some empty train cars.
In this demo, there's nothing to it that's really sort of like particular. The strange animal elements, you know, that are part of the game as teased by the trailers, only really sort of like hinted at here or there. But it's a lot of like, you know, deformed looking weird guys chasing you around basically.
And you just trying to escape before having, before succumbing to a horrible death. Not a super long demo, but pretty promising to be honest. Like it's, these are really set piece games, you know.
They're like, the puzzles are super light. And it's really about, you know, knocking through a bunch of these platforming sections and light puzzles until a set piece kicks off where you're being chased by something or you're hiding from something. And it's that same like loop over and over again, where, you know, there's a bit of calm and then something scary happens and then something exciting happens and then things kind of reset.
And this demo definitely has that, that sort of like ramp up and sort of punctuation to it and then kind of resets again. And, you know, you get about, you get like two loops like that basically and then the demo is over. But, you know, it looks nice.
You can play it in single player, no problem. You control both characters at once and then the other one's kind of automated. That seems to work pretty well.
I think they kind of expect that some people will play this in single player. I actually think that the co-op thing will probably make it quite popular with people because, you know, we talk about the fact that, you know, the split fiction is a big success this year because there are still not that many high fidelity, fun games, but not too long, you know, kind of things that you can share with other people. And I think that will help it stand out.
What are your thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I played the demo as well for this one. So, yeah, I'm definitely excited about playing it in cart with Catherine after our recent Absalom adventure and split fiction earlier in the year. I kind of I long for a few more of these sort of couch copy things.
Um, yeah, I do like it. I know I worry that this general format of game is getting like a little bit played out once upon a time. The kind of the cinematic 2D puzzle platformer, you know, they felt quite rare.
And now I'm not it's not like there's millions of them. It's not like you're wading through an ocean of these things in the indie space. You know, I think they're still quite kind of expensive and difficult to make.
But the certain beats of it, you know, even in this little demo, there were certain bits where you're like, OK, I've sort of seen a variation on this puzzle before. And you're setting this up and the way you're introducing this and the sort of stealth of avoiding the big scary man. You know, I guess it all depends on like how far they can push those set pieces and like how fucked up the weird creations can get.
You know, because there were some like spectacular things in Little Nightmares. I've only played the first one, but that sort of justify, you know, playing it just because there are a couple of moments where, you know, the enemies were so kind of creepy and messed up. So I would definitely play through it, but I also wonder if like there needs to be a new thing.
Well, I would say that the one complaint I had playing this was, there was a moment where I was hiding from one of the big dudes. And then the game, I was basically like shouting at my monitor, what is the one thing you want me to do to trigger the next set piece basically? And it was like, run up this little ramp, climb through a window and escape from the big dude.
And I was like, oh, right, okay. Then I guess I was making a mistake by trying to hide behind this other stack of suitcases or whatever. And so in that respect, yeah, like you're a bit like, oh, you know, all the sort of like scripted elements of a, you know, of a set piece in this kind of game, maybe I'm growing a little bit tired of them.
But yeah, I don't know if it's done to a very high quality, if it's got some cool weird things to show you, and it does have some freaky dudes in this, those like empty skin suit things that swim after you, those are pretty freaky, you know? Yeah, so we'll see. It's probably gonna land in that seven or eight out of 10 category based on this, but that's, you know, it all depends on how many interesting things it's got to show you, but that's out next year, Matthew.
So what's your first pick?
My first pick is called CiniCross. I would say a theme of Next Fest Demos this year is everything's a roguelike now, or if you can name it, people have mixed it in with roguelike, probably following on from Bellatro. So I saw like Domino roguelikes and Fruit Machine roguelikes and various other things.
This is a PitCross roguelike, which I picked because I really like PitCross, and you know, I thought it was sort of interesting how they were doing it. You're going across a map, but each event is a PitCross grid, which people who aren't familiar with them, that is a sometimes called nonograms. It's a sort of, it reminds me a bit of Minesweeper, where you basically have to work out which squares are active and inactive on each line based on a load of number clues, and you have to sort of reverse engineer where you're going to put all these markers based on these numbers.
But here, the pressure is that it's against the clock, a very tight time limit, the longer you spend on it, you know, you've got an overall time limit for your run, and so it's eating into that, so you're basically encouraged to really rush through them at speed and probably make mistakes as you're going, which costs you further time. But as you're completing these grids, you're also unlocking power-ups and passives and buffs as you do in a rogue, like all sort of like randomly doled out to you, which can modify the rules of the next grid that you do. So like, you know, if you complete a whole line, it may auto-complete two other squares on the grid, say.
So you know, ideally you want things which are going to synergise and help make the grid super easy. And then you eventually make your way through a maze of events and you get to a boss fight where there tends to be a more outrageous modifier, like there was one which kept undoing the work I was doing in the grid, and you're fighting the natural difficulty of doing one of these grids, the time pressure of doing it, and these extra rules. It's really, really difficult, but I did quite like someone taking Pit Cross, which is like an absolute chilled out time waster activity, and applying a bit of pressure to it.
I think my big problem with this one is that the visual style of it and the actual framing of it didn't really do much for me. It's kind of slightly gloomy, slightly kind of horror-y. It reminded me a little bit of that loop hero game.
Oh yeah, yeah, it does have that vibe.
But it's a little bit nothing-y. Like, it hasn't got like a banger of a piece of music playing. And, you know, it's not like the feedback's super nice.
The stuff, you know, which maybe gives something like Bellatro that kind of pizzazz where just everything feels like a million bucks when it's happening. It doesn't really have that. It's mostly you getting your ass handed to you by quite a stingy timer.
And, you know, I died on this loads, but then I kept coming back to it as well because I was determined to try and make it a bit further. Compelling, but I don't know if it's generally like nice enough to necessarily be like a top tier example of this kind of game.
Yeah, it's interesting because I think that the UI bits around the side look better than the actual grids you play on. Right, which have no sort of like possessed them whatsoever. But they have at least tried with the horror theming to to give it a bit more flavor around the edges.
But yeah, to look at the actual game being played, I mean, it's pretty flat looking, right?
Yeah, but you're so locked in on the grid that you don't really notice that as much. It's only when you, you know, you sit back at it or when you lose, you suddenly have a moment to think, ah, this isn't quite doing it for me, you know?
Yeah, it's a shame because I mean, you know, to look at like everything going on when you're deep into a run, it's got that Slay the Spire thing of like having 40 different things in your inventory that are all popping off and doing stuff. So superficially, it looks like mixing Picross with something with that element should be incredibly appealing. But I agree that I think what secretly sets some of these TimeSync games apart from others is just that having that next level visual design.
It's just being a little bit nicer looking than anything that resembles it. And if you don't have that differentiator, I'm not sure if you're going to find the audience that you want. But yeah, interesting.
What led you to get this one, by the way? Was it just digging until you found something you liked the look of?
Yeah, I was digging through it and I saw something and went, oh, that looks like PitCross. Obviously CiniCross, the name, gives a clue that it's some kind of PitCross connection. I love the PitCross games on DS.
I love 3D PitCross on the 3D, also on the DS back in the day. Yeah, I thought, oh, I'll give that a go. That sounds, I thought, oh, maybe this is like the next big sort of Bellatro type thing.
And I don't know if it's necessarily got the breakout appeal for that.
Fair enough. Okay, well, CiniCross, there you go, trying to repeat the names of the games more. CiniCross.
My first game was Reanimal, Matthew's first game was CiniCross. Okay, next up then is a game called Birdcage, Matthew. Do you know this game?
This was recommended to me this evening on Blue Sky when I put out a shout for any demos that I should not be missing. Someone said, I don't know if you like shoot-em-ups, but you should try Birdcage.
Yeah, so, you know, I was aware of this game because the composer of this podcast's theme tune, Barry Topping, does the music for this game.
Oh, shit.
And has worked, I believe, has worked on this game in a development capacity. And the music is absolutely fucking phenomenal, I was saying this. So it is a shoot-em-up.
It is clearly inspired by treasure games, but there is definitely an element of MGS1 aesthetic to it. There are codec calls and UI elements that 100% recall, specifically recall the original Metal Gear Solid and even music cues when you're in those codec bits like Barry does. Barry is very good at evoking eras of music without actually just borrowing from them, but giving them a fresh sheen, hence people comparing our theme tune to music from a Sonic game, for example.
So I see that as a compliment. And yeah, it's really, really fun to play. It's, you know, if you think that being a shoot-em-up that's inspired by Treasure Games will be, make it too hard for you to play.
It has three different difficulty settings, and the easy difficulty setting gives you a rechargeable shield that makes it simpler to play, but not so straightforward that the challenge is removed. It's still pretty tricky even with the shield, because there are always fucking loads and loads of bullets going on at once on screen in this game. So you have two modes of fire, like you can fire in this wide triangular spread out fire, and you can also do a concentrated vertical fire that just directly enables you to be more precise, but also slows down your ship, so it makes it easier to dodge bullets, and that will end up being the style of fire that you use in boss battles, for example, where you want to do more damage, but you also want to be able to maneuver around projectiles with a bit more flexibility.
But you also have this sword ability, where you can use it in 360 degrees, and it damages enemies, and you can even launch it as well, this lightsaber-looking thing, and it can also absorb blue projectiles, so there's a little bit of Icaruga to that aspect of it. But the aesthetic is much more, I would say, Sega Saturn era visually. I think it looks amazing, it plays really well, the music is fantastic.
It's really, really good. This was a game that was, I knew Barry had worked on it, but it was also recommended to me by Steam's algorithm that seems to think I'm a huge shmup fan. And I would say that the presentation makes it next level.
Like I couldn't give you an accurate assessment of what the scene is like for shmups on Steam, like what is popping off, what matters. It's so specialist a genre, I would never claim to be an expert on it. But I think that an normie could enjoy this, and a normie should definitely hear some of the music that Barry has composed for it.
So yeah, it's cool. Did you give it a go in the end?
I haven't. No, I haven't get no that. I only got that message as I was eating my dinner.
So I'll have to squeeze one in. Why Birdcage?
Well, so the way they kind of like sell the story, and there is a little bit of story in here, but it's not like too serious. You're trying to escape from something. I think you're trying to destroy something called the World Egg, which anything that's got egg in the title, I will just laugh out unfortunately because I'm very immature.
So, shoot, slash and weave through bullets and enemies in this story-driven arcade shooter. The Raid on Daughters have launched their ultimate weapon, that's the World Egg, Matthew. Take control of the experimental gunship Halcyon and break out of the cage.
Maybe there was an actual cage at the start, I don't really remember, but there's two levels in this demo. You can see the difficulty ramping up fast, but the set piece design is really good. The levels are not that long, and it's really, really cool to swipe that big sword thing through enemies that are flying towards you.
So, yeah, it's a strong recommend from me on this one. Well worth having on your radar, and the game is out on the 18th of November. So, we'll find out pretty soon what people think of it.
I look forward to the no doubt three reviews of this that will come out because no one really has experts on this genre on team these days, such as it is, with Martin Robinson no longer working in games media. That's tough. I look forward to seeing what retro gamer make of this, but yeah, this is definitely worth checking out even if you think this genre won't be for you.
That similar feeling I had to when I was playing Ikaruga and I was like, this is really cool even though I'm not quite the person for this kind of game, you know? What's your next game, Matthew?
My next game is called No More Work For Ito. It is a, I guess, a visual novel adventure game with a horror vibe. The set up being that you're a guy who's working late in his office, his company have asked him and his team to stay late.
I don't really know where it's set, they've all got quite western names despite Ito in the title. You're in this office, it's absolutely tipping down with rain, which is a lovely touch, like in all the scenes where there are windows, it's just got a really nice rainy cityscape in the background and like the waters coming down the windows in this really nice pixel art. It's got really good vibes of working after hours.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Which is something I sort of know about from when you worked on magazines. There's a weird vibe that happens in an office and there's like a camaraderie between you and your colleagues and that's really nice. So it makes me feel a little bit warm and nostalgic for that reason.
But at the same time, about a minute into it, one of your colleagues tells you a spooky story about how allegedly at some other companies in this city recently, workers have like lost their minds and gone on killing rampages. But he sort of tells it as this sort of urban legend, you know, rather than here are sort of hard and fast details. And it kind of taps into that thing of where someone does tell you like a little spooky story and it just kind of gets under your skin a little bit and colours what's going on.
Because then all of a sudden you're in this building thinking, well, is this going to happen here? Why did he tell me this story? And it sort of like slightly sort of destabilises your character.
And really, it's quite a short demo. All you're doing is like pottering around the office. You go and make a coffee in your little room.
You can go down and explore more of the building and meet some other members of the team and talk to them. You can go on your PC and I don't know if it's going to have more of a gameplay system on that PC about like working because there were buttons you can't press until you've drunk caffeine and I was thinking, oh, is this going to be like getting your work done somehow? Are they actually going to work that into the gameplay or is it going to be like purely linear, like narrative experience?
I can't really tell from the demo, but it was really spooky, really evocative. I've had one good scare that got me. I will preface that by saying I am incredibly wimpy and I'm scared by everything.
It's not going to like fuck you up for life or anything. At the end of it, I wanted to see what would happen next. There were lots of dark corridors you couldn't walk down because it said they weren't in the demo, but it definitely trades on how bad an office can feel when the lights start going out and yeah, just kind of cool.
Yeah. Why was Keyhouse so spooky when the lights went off, shutting off behind you? Because they'd automatically switch off, wouldn't they?
So you need to wave to switch them back on. There's just that flash of panic of like, what if the light doesn't come back on and I'm stuck in the dark?
Yeah, or like they don't know that I'm here and they think everyone's left and they lock it and I'm locked inside. Also, just a flaw which you're used to seeing loads of quite lively people on. And there's all this weird, you know, there's all this sort of like, weird merchandise from games that once it's by itself becomes a bit spookier, like a stature of Lara Croft in the dark is way scarier than it is in the day.
Yeah, you were also someone who's quite preoccupied with like office life. And yeah, I always remember an observation you had about Mad Men, the very last episode, and I guess a slight spoiler in a way. But there is a scene with two characters in an empty office.
And the shit's just got strange, like one's playing a piano and one's cycling a bike around like this empty office floor. And I remember you talking about like the the old Future London office and how that was quite accurate of how strange things get when these spaces that are meant to have people in them just empty out suddenly. So I think this is something you think about quite a lot.
Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, lo and behold, there just happens to be a game about that subject.
So yeah, it was definitely going to work for me. Yeah, I just have no clue how this game is going to develop or if it's going to be an out and out horror game or just sort of like, you know, giving you a little prickly feeling on the back of your neck by being a bit unnerving. But yeah, the demo, the demo worked.
Yeah, I mean, I like the pixel art a lot. Like I say, it's of a very high quality. Like the, I would say the characters have a, the visual style is just a little bit of the Phoenix Wright art style about it.
You know, just the characters in front of you, they're like realistically drawn, but, you know, but they're sort of stylized. It's a hard style to summarize, but it's not overly stylized, you know?
It also has, it has a really good font for the text. It just really suits the world and like the text noise. Like it gets all the basics right of, you know, how you present unspoken dialogue and it just, it feels, yeah, it just all feels a little bit spooky and it's really well judged.
It kind of looks like it could be a DS game as well.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. It's, I do like the art style a lot. I've added it to my wishlist off the back of that and had like 15 user reviews and everyone who played it seemed to really like it.
And it's now this quarter apparently. So yeah, that's interesting. What a good find.
You've definitely, you've sort of like stuck to some castle classic turf with these two picks so far.
Pit cross and people being obsessed with offices.
And that game again was No More Work For Ito. And the game I mentioned previously was Birdcage. So just continue to provide that service.
A brief aside here, Matthew, for Lumines Arise. Have you played this demo yet?
I have, whenever it last appeared on Steam a couple of months ago.
Some of it, like around Gamescom time?
Yeah, maybe.
Did you play the, did you play the, have you played it on PSVR 2 yet? Is the demo, I see the demo works on there.
Oh, I haven't, no, I've only played it on my PC.
I assume that you're going to save playing it for that because that's got to be like the big bonus of playing it, of having a PSVR 2 headset, right? Is being able to play this on there.
Yeah, I think so. When I played the demo, what it mainly did was remind me that I'm fucking terrible at Lumines. And I think it's going to take me a while to get anywhere with this.
Like, I really, like, I felt like I just didn't understand it. Even though I do understand it, I do know what the game is about. You know, I have played iterations of it before, but I felt like it was like an insult to what they were trying to achieve, me playing it.
Well, it's funny, because I did finish this on its default difficulty, like, first time out, but it got a little hairier towards the end there than it maybe should have done for a man who has played a fair amount of Luminaires. But I said this when I, you know, spoke to the producer, Mark McDonald, when I was at Summer Game Fest. I was like, I don't, I've played a lot of Luminaires, so I'm not good at Luminaires.
I couldn't tell you really any techniques I use in Luminaires. I don't have a Luminaires version of like, you know, you build, you leave room for like one long line block in Tetris, and then you just fucking pop that down. Like, I don't have anything in my arsenal like that with Luminaires.
And he said that basically that there'll be like a tutorial function to the game that will help teach people, almost for the first time, how Luminaires actually works. And I think that will be where you're at home with that sort of thing. But there's no arguing with that Tetris Effect style presentation, right?
It's really just second to none, you know?
It's really hectic. I don't know if the new demo has the same three levels they put out in the older demo, but the one with like the two chameleons freaking out at the side was, I mean, that was really stressful. That was the third level, I think the spiciest one.
And they were just going mad. And I was struggling to get my head around it and freaking out and being a bit upset by the two chameleons. Yeah, you just know it's going to go to like even wilder places.
I think I told you about the story behind the chameleons, right? In the that Excel episode we did a few months ago. Did we talk about that?
I've definitely said the word chameleons on this podcast.
You have, but I believe, I'm going to have to go over my notes to confirm this. But I think what I was told during the interview was that, in the old Q Entertainment office, there was a poster of a chameleon in a key place.
Oh, right. You didn't tell me that.
Yeah, it's like a tribute to an unusual feature of their workplace, that the art team basically put the chameleon in the game, which I think is a really nice touch.
Where is the weird place? I hope it was on the inside of a toilet cubicle door.
I can't remember if it was a poster or something, but there was some kind of image of a chameleon that was in a place that people saw a lot in this office. So I like that. But in general, there's just something about the vibe of the Misoguchi games, right?
And the style of the music where it's sort of like, you know, it has that kind of J-pop energy, but it's also got that really reflective electro sound that just makes you think about the past. Somehow it's capable of doing that. And then turning a switch and it being like, fuck, the BPM has gone through the roof of my heart rate is going like this.
It really takes you on that journey, much like Tetris Effect did. So yeah, I can't wait for it, man. I don't have loads more to say about it, but I really like Lumines.
I think it's not Tetris, but it's up there as one of the more enduring puzzle formats of the last few decades. So yeah, nice to see it in this form for sure. What's your next game, Matthew?
Opus Prism Peak, which is, I don't know if you remember a few years ago in our Game of the Year episode, I picked a game called Opus Echo of Starsong.
I do. You liked it and it was you recommended to buy someone from Katakya, remember, and then you got really into it.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I really liked it. This sort of space exploration game, sort of interactive fiction, but did some really nice world building.
And this studio, whose name I have forgotten, it's like Simogo, but it's not Simogo because that's obviously Simogo. They've made a series of games that are all Opus something. And I don't know if they're like directly connected or if they're all part of the same fictional universe, but they're all quite standalone, quite mechanically different to one another.
This one, more so than the other, if the last one was this sort of space epic, this one is about a man, sort of magic to a fantasy landscape, where he gets to know the ghosts of these sort of animal spirits by taking photographs of them. And also by taking photographs of things in the environment. He's a photographer in real life, this character.
He sort of fills out a notebook with photos. He sort of fills out almost like an encyclopedia of the world, which he's illustrating with the photos he takes. There are these sort of fountains, which give you riddles that you have to solve by taking photos of specific things that they're hinting at.
So it's still interactive fiction, but it's a sort of third person photography puzzle adventure game set in a fantasy land with lots of talking animals. Very different vibe. Quite a swerve, I'd say, from Star Song, which just felt like a very confident, competent bit of sci-fi storytelling.
It's interesting, there's a quote actually on the Steam store page for this one from a Japanese outlet that likens it to a Shinkai film who's the anime director, I think I mentioned on a recent episode, who did about, no, not about you, your name. And this quote says something like, oh, it's like playing a Shinkai movie, it's like an interactive Shinkai movie, which is absolutely spot on. Like the visual style, it's kind of like a 3D version of what looks like a 2D hand-drawn style, but also like the vibe of it, you know, this sort of grounded human character in quite a surreal environment feels very, very true to that.
So that's probably what was gelling with me. So even though I was a little bit thrown at first by what a departure it was, by the end of it, I was quite into it. A difficult one to demo, I think, because I imagine it's got quite a carefully crafted narrative and the demo is like the beginning of the game and then like a chunk much further on and it's beautifully presented.
Like it has a bit of bespoke VO sort of explaining the gap in between. It says, so in this game you're playing as this guy, you know, at this point he's done this. It's almost like playing a game at Gamescom and having a PR explain it to you.
Like they'd really put the effort in and then when you finished it, another bit of video came in and sort of said, oh, we're going to take this idea and expand it here and you're going to see more of this. So, you know, we hope you like this and you kind of come back. And I don't know, it just it left a very positive impression of of like a team that was super confident in their work.
You know, not just the game they've made, but in the way to like package it and talk about it. And yeah, I just yeah, I really liked it. I felt like I'd been to a Gamescom appointment without having been to a Gamescom, which is, you know, win-win.
I think that's what you want sometimes, because, you know, you, especially when the public is interacting with your game for the first time, you just don't want them to have like a disconnect where they don't understand how a certain thing works or whatever. So the idea of being like, this is what we're doing and why is, I think a sound strategy for a, for Steam Next Fest, and probably helps you embed in people's brains. I mean, I would say this must have been a successful outing for them because the demo's got 268 reviews on Steam, which is a lot for a demo.
Pretty good sign that it's cut through. PC Gamer covered it and Gaming Bible covered it. So, there's definitely people are paying attention to it.
But I am, like you say, I'm struck by how different it is to their last game, but also confidently presented it is. Like the 3D art should not be this good from a developer that's known for making 2D games. You know, right, right, an amazing step up.
So this might be the the Opus game that really breaks out for them, you know.
Yeah, yeah, I just, yeah, I just wonder if it's going to be, if it's going to have like any edge or if it's going to be a little bit too much like talking to cute animals. That does give me pause only just due to my personal tastes. I'm not really into like cute animal stories.
That's the only thing that could maybe knobble it for me.
Yeah, okay, that's fair enough. But again, I've added, you know, all the games you've mentioned so far to my wishlist, apart from the first one you mentioned that...
CiniCross.
Yeah, because that just...
The Drab, PitCross, so... A Roguelike. It just...
It looked like a tough hang that one.
If it was Mario CiniCross, would you go for it?
No, I don't think so. If it was Wario CiniCross, I'd perhaps consider it. I did also think for a second, looking at CiniCross, that is this a fucking fancy...
Have they turned Minesweeper into a fucking Roguelike? Because that would be a dream Matthew Castle game. But yes.
Okay, so that's really cool. Opus Prism Peak there for people keeping score. Okay, so my next game Matthew is The Killing Stone.
Are you aware of this game?
I am. I follow a few people from Question on Blue Sky and I've seen them talking about it, but I actually haven't tried it.
Yes, so this studio question is probably best known and most discussed on this podcast, the game The Magic Circle. It's kind of like a cult game about making games that we like to rather a lot. It fuses various art styles from PC gaming past and also has this kind of like programming enemies to do your bidding aspect to it, along with a lot of commentary about sort of like auteur driven game development.
It's a really fun game. It's often on sale for very cheap and it comes from a few ex-BioShock people. So we like that game a lot.
And Asstudio also made another game called The Blackout Club, which was like a co-op horror game. I don't know if that like massively took off, but the people who played it, I think really liked it. Became quite a good sort of like horror role play Twitch thing, is my understanding.
I think it had like... The developers did like live vocal performances in the game as the ghosts. Yeah, which is like, hey, log in and scare you and say shit to you.
It was a really cool idea. And I think that it just didn't quite find the audience that it maybe deserved. This game, very, very different vibe.
So I'm going to explain how the game describes itself, because I'm going to be honest, I didn't understand what the hell was going on in this story at all. I got the very top line that there is like some kind of devil's bargain and some kind of narrator who's like in debt to the devil and you have to clear their debt by defeating him at this board game. It's basically what I think the premise is, but I'm just going to let the game explain itself because I truly was at a complete loss and couldn't read the text after a while, because I was like, it's just not going in.
It's a bit like Destiny's Story, where I just watch it and it just does not go into my brain for whatever reason. Beat the devil at his own game. The Killing Stone is a deck-building card battler wrapped in a 17th century folk horror narrative.
Clean the sins of a cursed family by bargaining against a series of demons and outwitting the devil himself. What this basically comes down to is a card game that has a whiff of inscription about it and a whiff of Yu-Gi-Oh about it. Let me be honest and say that one of the things that I was definitely too old for, but got quite into, is Catherine Castle Classic, Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories on PS1.
This game reminded me just the tiniest bit of playing that. It's basically like you're positioned, so you're on the left and the enemy is on the right, and you're playing cards facing each other, but everyone's in a row. So you might put your strongest card you'll play at the front, your weakest card you'll play at the back because you'll know that your strongest one's going to take some damage from the enemy on their next turn basically.
So I think you can only have like five enemies in a row at once, but placement's very key. So let's say you place like one kind of like zombie thing, and then on the enemy turn they place some kind of, I think there's like some kind of like deformed urchin card or something. That's not quite right.
It might be cursed urchin, something like that. Just sort of like maybe demonic urchin, something like that. They play that.
And then when you activate, when you've played your cards, you spent your AP, you've played your cards, you press X, you do all your moves, then it's the enemy turn and they do their moves. But then once you have several turns in, you have basically five different cards from you and the enemy on this line going towards each other. But the placements might change.
You might get a card whose ability is they can slide behind enemy lines and directly do damage to you, the player. And you'll just, there'll be a lot of like chopping and changing of the order of where different enemies are placed and how damage is being distributed. And so you might get one enemy who like loses health on every single round, but they also do damage, like one damage to any neighboring cards in every round.
So where those like five different enemies, different cards are positioned is really key. Quite hard to explain without playing it, to be honest. But what's interesting is it's got this, I think like what is fresh about it, it's got this reserve card system where you can basically play a card to drop in when another card dies.
So, for example, you get this like one dagger weapon that if you equip one of your cards with it on the board, and someone kills your character, then it will suddenly do three damage to any enemies in front of it, and that makes killing that card like a bit of a trap for the other player. So it allows you to do things like that. You can even reserve in other different combatant cards.
So you could just stack characters to go into play once another character has been killed. And you can also do things like play status effect cards where you kill one of your characters, but then it comes back as another monster with plus two HP and plus two attack, basically. It's got a lot going on, but like I say, I think there's a slight, I think it's the cursed sort of like horror vibes of it.
It reminds me of Inscription for that reason, but it's very difficult and it's quite, I think I can see it having quite a lot going on ultimately, because you can level up certain cards, you can swap sort of like sets of cards for new sets of cards, and it's all navigated via this rogue-like Slay the Spire style grid, where the next spot might be fight these enemies, or it might be, you sort of like gain a status effect, like a negative status effect or a positive status effect. It's plotting your route to the boss basically in each round. The only other thing to say about it really in a top-line way, is it does have first-person storytelling, so you're actually moving around before you play these games and interacting with NPCs in this house with this family.
But again, I didn't really know what was going on, so that part I didn't totally tune into. But the actual card game part of it, I would say it's telling that this is the demo I played the most. I played it for 90 minutes.
I could easily have played it for more. I think it's got like a massive potential. It's not out until next year, I don't believe, but The Killing Stone, I thought it was really cool.
So yeah, it's well worth checking out, Matthew.
Yeah, I will, absolutely. That sounds cool. And I like the team and I like the stuff they've made in the past.
So yeah, we'll definitely try out. Were you like collecting loads of new cards and whatnot as you were going on? Is it like very deck-buildery in that way?
It's actually quite restrained with that sort of thing. So from what I could tell, the only time you could get new cards is when you go into this place, you land on a certain type of spot, a certain type of event. And it lets you trade all your cards are in sets of three or four.
And then you can basically choose which set of three or four you get rid of to bring in new cards. And I think it keeps, I think it's quite guarded about the amount of cards you have. I don't think it ever lets you have loads and loads and loads.
It's a bit like, how do you work with the deck you've got? At least from what I've played so far, that seems to be the case. So you'll see like, oh, a status effect I've not seen before.
Or like, oh, that's like a leveled up version of a card I've already got. I'm going to swap a set I've already got. And then you can re-roll the potential cards you can trade if you don't like the ones you're being presented with until you get a set that you do like.
So it's got a lot going on. Yeah, I think that the important thing is that the, where it stands, like the little characters look nice on the board. It's visually in a pretty good place.
So I think that's quite important for it to find the audience it wants. Yeah, yeah, it's decent, man.
Nice. Is it going to replace Queen's Blood in my card game affections?
I did think of that a little bit playing this, actually. This is just the tiniest bit of Queen's Blood, too. This is, again, a genre I'm not super-favorite with, so I feel like all my frames of reference are basically sledgehammer subtlety with how I make comparisons here.
Hence, me fucking going with Yu-Gi-Oh and Inscription combined. It's the best I could do. But yeah, I would say well worth giving a go.
There was a trailer for it at the Future Game Show's August thing. But it feels like the sort of game that, if the deckbuilder rogue-like sickos find it, they'll probably really like it. I failed the same grid of, you know, like, the same kind of run three times and kept trying until I cracked it.
So it's got something about it, I would say. It's got potential, even if I don't know what the hell's going on in the story. So yes.
What's your next game, Matthew?
My next game is this bit of a mouthful. The Remake of the End of the Greatest RPG of All Time.
Hmm. It sounds like a game by the inscription guy. What's his name?
Daniel Mullins.
Yeah, it's got a bit of Mullins vibe about it.
It's definitely Mullins adjacent. I'd say it's like a mix of a Daniel Mullins game and Tunic in that ostensibly you're playing a remake of a 16-bit JRPG. It looks like it's been given a bit of a 2.5 HD makeover, so sprites in 3D environments.
But you are also at the… where you pick up the game, which I think is the opening of the game, it's a save file which is almost complete. So it's a bit meta in that you're kind of playing someone else's save in this fictional, non-existent JRPG remake.
I think the save file is like 97% complete. When you boot it up, you can go into the inventory and it's quite a good send up of like a late game inventory in a JRPG. Like you've got all this amazing shit and it's got crazy names and I imagine if you're slightly better versed in like very specific, you know, Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, I imagine there's some like very good parodies in there that are going over my head, but it's clearly sending up something, you know, like there's like summons with crazy names and I don't think you can use any of the objects, they're just there for like lols.
But as you're going through this game, you are picking up pages of its instruction manual, which have both explained the game, but also have like handwritten notes. That's the tunic bit. It's like reading a game's, yeah, fake instruction manual.
And the way that that's meant to help is you're basically, cause you're playing the last hour of this JRPG that you haven't played up until this point, you actually don't know how any of it works. So you're trying to kind of reverse engineer the rules of the game from this instruction manual. So it's got more of a sort of deductive puzzle element than you might think.
Like a lot of the battles, it's about using the instruction manual to work out how these quite weird characters behave to make them succeed in the turn-based battle system. So everything that I played in the demo, I would say had a puzzle backbone to it. It felt like there was a solution.
It never felt like you were actually playing a JRPG. But then adding a further meta-level on top of that, you pick up these, there are director's commentary nodes, which are both audio or also like video clips. And watching the video clips begins to tell a story of these two, you know, youngish guys, I'd say they're in their like mid-20s, who are on a game programming course, a game design course.
And they're making this remake as a love letter to this forgotten JRPG from their childhood. There's also hints of like strange stuff going on, like beyond them and maybe beyond the game, like weird glitches and weird things happening in the game. I don't know if this is going to be like secretly, incredibly cursed, but there's just so many layers to it.
And there was so much going on, but I just came out quite impressed by, you know, the ambition of the thing and what it was riffing on. I would have quite happily have just played this weird JRPG that you have to solve using the instruction manual. I think that's a good enough central idea.
But once you put all this other stuff on there, you're like, I'm presumably this game is going to be longer than an hour. I'm not just going to finish this JRPG. And, you know, is it going to loop round?
Is it going to take us somewhere else? There's something hidden in there for sure. And that's what really kind of caught my imagination.
Yeah, interesting. I mean, this feels like something that should really appeal to me based on the frames of reference, you know?
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And it's quite a good sender.
It's just maybe if there's any risk, it's maybe doing like too much. Sending up that JRPG accurately is one thing. But then also sending up like a slightly fucked student remake of a game.
And then maybe there being some drama on top of that, which is impacting all those things. It may just be a little bit too clever-clever. Hard to tell from just the demo.
But yeah, I'd swear like you'd get more out of that inventory screen than I did.
Well, there's something about the way they're marketing on the Steam page that they're almost trying to tell you there is like a Mullinsy aspect to it. Like it's, if the title doesn't give it away, then the dude's talking and they're being a CRT TV with the very awful looking American SNES next to it is like another hint. So I guess like when you're not Daniel Mullins, you have to go a bit further out of your way to tell people that's what you're doing with your game, you know, in order to kind of communicate that.
But yeah. Yeah, it's weird because in the making of documentary clips you get, they're wearing like tunic t-shirts.
Oh, right.
They're really like announcing, oh, we're in this sort of same playful space as that game. And, you know, it seems very literate in the space of very like meta narrative games. Yeah.
It's just like, will it go to the sort of weird fucked up places that Daniel Mullins games sometimes go, you know, which can get quite kind of cursed as they go along. Given how popular or certainly critically lauded the Mullins games are, it is interesting that not many people, you know, there haven't been many sort of parodies or attempts to mimic that style. So it's quite cool to see a Mullins alike happen.
His next game's got to be like pretty close because it's like been four years since the inscription. You'd think that.
Isn't he doing Pony Island 2?
Oh, is that what he's doing? Well, maybe that is it.
I think that has been announced. Yeah. But then you're like, is that even going to be Pony Island 2?
Fuck knows with that guy.
Yeah. Interesting. Where did you fall on Tunic in the end?
Did we ever talk about that?
Did you ever play it properly? I never finished it. It just was one that slipped through the cracks.
Not a very interesting take. I really like what I played of it. I don't know why I didn't carry on.
Maybe I had some other sort of information management games going on at the time. I couldn't hold it all in my head.
You were playing a lot of Picross on DS at the time, if I recall correctly, Matthew. Yeah, obviously a favourite of mine. Okay, well, this goes on the wishlist too, because I'm curious to see just exactly how they're juggling all those different parts to it and whether they can make something of it.
So yeah, I'll do a super quick one here, Matthew. So this game is called Evil Egg. This was recommended to me by the Steam algorithm.
And I clicked on the game because I thought the name was amusing, and I thought the picture of a giant egg was amusing. And do you know why I downloaded it? It's because former guest of the podcast, Alex Wiltshire, had this on his wishlist.
And I thought, right, that's a smart guy who knows a lot about games.
And he loves evil eggs.
I want to see what the deal is based on that. That's like the fun feature of Steam, is it? You can see what has caught someone else's fancy.
And it's this really colourful, really minimalist, 360 degree, like Geometry Wars style shooter, basically. Where it's like bullet hell. And each time that you select a level, you can select, I think, one of three levels.
And you get told what the risk is, what the reward is, in terms of the score multipliers you can get, or the different extra abilities you can get, whether you can add missiles to your arsenal, that kind of thing. And then you go into the level, and then loads and loads of little colourful block things just fly at you and do terrible shit to you. And you just frantically run around the screen for 30 seconds blasting all this stuff until the level is over.
And it's really, really hard. And I thought excellent, and one of the best things I played during SteamX Fest. And I think the game is going to be free, and it's out in like 11 days.
It's 30th of October, I believe. So pretty close by the time people are listening to this episode. I was just very impressed by having this stripped down visual style, but still being pretty coherent.
And also just being a really, so it's got like a rogue-like structure to it, where I think you're basically trying to make as much progress as you can before things just get too frantic for you to keep track of. But it really has the whiff of like, if you're at work and you have five minutes in between bits and pieces, let's just say that some of our listeners might be in that situation based on what you observe in the Discord with you, then this would be a perfect like, desktop alt tab out, kind of like, jump in.
I mean that's fine if you're working from home, I can't pull that shit in my office. If Rob comes down the stairs and sees me playing a game called Evil Egg on toast.
Well I mean it doesn't broadcast that it's called Evil Egg while you're playing it, only on the menu screen.
Yeah, but if he says what's that I can't be like oh that's Google Sheets, you know. I'll end up telling him it's Evil Egg.
But I assume there's some kind of like, I'm really just swiping in the dark here, Yu-Gi-Oh style again, but I've seen there's some kind of like Jeff Minter influence to this. It's really frantic, colourful, minimalist, but yeah very enjoyable. I had about I think four different runs in it, I played like 20 minutes of it, but that's enough to get through like pretty sub, have a pretty substantial run with it.
It's just a great, a great time killer, looks really good and there's really nice feedback to the different powers too. So yeah, evil egg, it's free. I mean you might as well download it and see if it's good basically.
So yeah, I don't think this is a free game. Surely that's just the game.
Yeah I think they've got a bit of a following on social media, so they must be like a known quantity. The developer is called Ivy Sly. There's no publisher obviously, it's just a free game.
But yeah, just a very high quality. I don't know if it will ever end up anywhere else, probably not. But this is the sort of thing Steam is good for.
So yeah. And then I thought Matthew maybe we should talk about Skate Story as well, which is another of the demos I think was actually technically out before Steam Next Fest. It's a Devolver game, so it kind of has a bit of an inbuilt advantage versus some of the other Steam Next Fest demos.
But it has been a long time coming. Yeah, so did you play this one?
Unhelpfully, I haven't.
Well, that's okay.
Yeah, it's one of the bigger ones I feel like I didn't get to.
Yeah, so it is a game where you're skateboarding through some version of hell, but I'll just let the game explain itself here. You are a demon in the underworld, made out of glass and pain, the devil has given you a skateboard with a simple deal. Skate to the moon and swallow it, and you shall be freed.
Olly kickflip and grind your way through the ash and smoke of the empty lands as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Learn to master your way and motion to conquer the weeping concrete. Savour the ritualistic beauty as you set your feet to pop a perfect kickflip.
So, what this game amounts to is, I guess like somewhere on the spectrum between Skate, the EA games, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in terms of complexity. You can pull off moves pretty quickly, sorry, pretty easily, pretty simply. It's usually some kind of like combination of pressing, tapping B on a controller, and then like one of the triggers, and that will allow you to do Ollies and manuals and all of your kind of like basic skateboarding moves.
You unlock more moves as you go. And then the aesthetic of it is you are playing this character who literally looks like they're made out of glass. And one of the first things you do in this game is skateboard through space, basically.
Skateboard through the stars towards the moon. It's got sort of like trippy 2001 ass, kind of like visual turns to it. It sort of mostly looks like black, white, and red, the visuals, but there's a very like distinct style to how many like crystalline things that you'll see while you're going through this game.
It's just very, very visually striking. And then the actual game part of it has these kind of like objective based, I don't want to say narrative bits as such, but there'll be bits where you have to complete a certain objective in a certain amount of time. Let's say hit all of these different points while jumping over this like fire that's on the ground.
Or like performing a certain amount of tricks to damage an enemy. Basically the combos you build can do damage to certain enemies in the game. So the more tricks you can combine and then kind of like, yeah, you can sort of basically pull together and then this is kind of like trick finisher thing that you do.
That then triggers the amount of damage that you just scored in points to the enemy. So the more skilled you are at the game, the more quickly you can get through those sorts of things, for example. In between these more hub style bits where you go to these like very strange characters and then get objectives to complete, like jump over these different sort of like manhole covers to have this weird smoke coming out of it, then come back and I'll give you this item that you need to progress.
And so in that respect it reminds me of other skateboarding games. But it's really about just looking at the thing, beholding the thing. Like I don't know if the skateboarding part of it is extraordinary as such.
The camera is very close to the character. You're not really playing it like a Tony Hawk's game most of the time. But as a thing to behold and sort of see what it's going to show you next visually, it's a cool game.
So I can see why people are hyped for it.
Yeah, what do you think Matthew? Does it have a scoring kind of combo system? Or is it not that kind of game?
Yeah, it does. But it's much simpler than something like Tony Hawk, where it doesn't feel like it's as harsh on you for fucking up. It's a bit more like it rewards you, I guess, Devil May Cry style, for like choosing a different move and not just repeating the same move over and over again.
The game rewards you for that. It encourages you to be playful with how you combine different types of moves together. So that's really as in-depth as it's gotten so far.
Do you get a sense that you'll be hanging around these hubs or returning to hubs to like play for high scores? Or is it more move-ever-forward? Does it feel more linear and story driven than that?
I think it feels linear and story driven, to be honest. There's like nine layers of the Underworld, which makes me think there's probably a different, surreal landscape for you in each of those layers. And so this first one was a lot of like these kind of like statues of philosophers that you interact with, and they're just quite strange dudes.
And one's like, oh, go buy me a juice from the shop. And you do, and then he's got the juice, and then he gives you one of the items that you get, that you need to progress, they're called Think Pieces, these little cubes with writing on them. You need two of those from the hub, which you can get in different ways in order to like progress to the, you know, the kind of narrative mission bit, quote unquote, that completes that layer, completes that chapter.
Yeah, pretty generous demo. It's, yeah, it's pretty cool. It's massively on people's radars already.
I think it's got a ridiculous amount of wish lists. I don't think it's going to be an extraordinary skating game, but who knows? Because you only really get the very basics of a skating game moveset in this first layer.
And then I think maybe you go up to these monoliths and they give you new skate abilities to learn and master. So by the time you get to the sixth or seventh layer, it might be a much more complex game. So yeah.
Do you think you'll play this, Matthew, when it comes out?
Yeah, I'll probably give it a go. You know, I like a little bit of a skateboarding game every once in a while. Does the Glass Man ever do the slightly sort of ambling on the spot Tony Hawk's pick a skater kind of move?
That sort of standing in a skate shop except made of glass, sort of leaning left and right.
He's sort of like a, he doesn't really, I've not really hung around long enough for that. You can get off your skateboard anytime and just walk around the hubs if you want to. But he's more a thing to sort of like look at than be like, oh look at him, he's just like Bam Margera doing his little thing or whatever.
It's not quite that funny. Have you shashed him yet?
Many times I think. He just sort of comes off his board and you just tap A to keep going again. But it's pretty low stakes.
I will say that the last mission bit that you do, it's quite hard to get the amount of points you need to complete it in the time frame that you have. So it will give you like a two or three minute timer for the objectives. So in that respect it can remind you of Tony Hawk a little bit because you have similar time constraints.
But I found I just couldn't be, I wasn't being creative enough to get, to do the damage I needed to the enemy in order to move on. So yeah, I think it's going to require a certain amount of mastery the deeper you get into it. But I also think that's exactly what people who play skateboarding games expect from these games, right?
I'll be interested to see if it is incredibly popular, whether it triggers a wave of other extreme sports where you're made out of unusual substances, a bit like how we had all the other extreme sports that followed in the wake of Tony Hawk. You had BMXing and pro surfing and all that. So maybe there could be a whole new industry of unusual, textiled extreme sports.
Sort of Matthew Castle's pro-Rio surfboarding.
Well, a person who's made out of Rio? What, like a puddle of tropical flavoured drink? I'd just instantly disperse in the ocean.
That wouldn't work at all.
But maybe he's suspended by gravity, but when he touches the ocean, he's completely fucked.
Or he's like Rio of Frozen. Like a giant Rio ice cube.
Yeah, maybe some vibe. Or a skateboarding, sorry, a snowboarding game but the man's made of cheese or something.
Dave Mirror, but he's made of rice paper.
Yeah, just goes tumbling down the mountain. Just blows away basically. It's not ideal.
Yeah, maybe. I think it more made me think that perhaps it just suggests an alternative for these types of games that's not tied to Skate or Tony Hawk, where, you know, I think for a second it felt like Olly Olly was a big deal, right? And people liked that last Olly Olly.
Well, the people who played it, obviously the studio closed, which was really sad. But I think there's there's always room for someone to come along and make a type of game like this that captures people's imaginations. It just seems like it's always been in the hands of these two big series.
And this is suggesting a slightly different path to that, which I think is I think is cool and, you know, hooks it all around a very distinct visual style. I kind of just want to play it to to see all of the cool things they do with that visual style, you know.
You want to see him eat the moon as well, right?
Well, yeah, you know, this you get a bit of that in this demo for sure. I think there's a different moon on each layer for you to eat, basically.
Oh, okay. Oh, you see, I pictured one moon, you know. That's quite a big promise to make at the outset of the game, that you're going to see the moon get eaten by a glass man.
Yeah, you escape. I would say that you've probably, you know, you've ridden your skateboard towards a moon and, you know, and sort of like done a few tricks around a moon within the first 30 minutes of playing the game. But that's, it doesn't wait to give you that kind of cosmic imagery basically.
So yeah, I think you're going to get a lot of moon for your butt, because that's good to know. What's your next game, Matthew?
My next game is The Seance of Blake Manor, which is I think coming out quite soon, actually. I only realized this after the fact. Being published by Raw Fury is a investigation game, I think made by the team who made Darkside Detective, which was those very nice games.
We like those games.
Yeah, I love those games. I mean, this is very different, way more ambitious. You're a detective basically going to this Blake Manor to investigate the disappearance of one of the guests, and it's a fully 3D world.
You can walk around. It's quite blueprints adjacent, I'd say, visually. It's got this slightly cartoony style to it, but very kind of handsomely drawn.
And you walk around this house, you know, investigating things, talking to suspects, picking up clues, picking up information. But there's two things that really jump out. One, the whole thing seems to be on a timer and every action you do.
So whenever you choose to interact with something, it tells you how far it's going to move on the clock. In the demo, that's mostly like a minute at a time. So if you look at this object, it'll take me a minute to describe it.
You know, if we mess around with this door lock, that'll take a minute. And it's suggested that time will always be moving forward in this game, that there is a finite amount of time to investigate this mystery, and that all the guests in the hotel are on their own schedule. So there's going to be an element of managing what you choose to investigate and when, and when you try and meet people and are people always going to be available.
Like, quite a big information keeping it all in your head sort of management game. It has a huge sprawling like mystery tree that fills out with information where you begin to see kind of how everything interlinks. So it almost has a little bit of like sort of outer wilds to it in that you're kind of getting your head around this wider hotel's sort of makeup, which obviously really speaks to me.
Normally in a game like this I panic if there's a time limit or something very systemic like that because I just want to drink everything in, you know, I just want to have time to think about it. Admittedly the clock's not just naturally ticking on like if you just walk around the hotel not doing anything the time doesn't move on so you can sort of think about what it is that you've actually learned. But certainly in this demo and why it's a good demo it, you know, sets up like a little goal that you're trying to achieve, you know, within the hour and you kind of get your head around how time is going to work and like how you want to be doing certain things and other things are, you know, probably less important and then it slightly teaches you how to sort of interrogate people and collect information and use it against them.
You know, it talks about how there are different like avenues to approach different characters from. And it gave me the impression by the end of the demo anyway, that it was going to be this like quite huge sort of free form investigation in this hotel, which presumably you'd have to play several times over in order to see everything and you can't be everywhere at once, so you're naturally going to miss things. And so it's going to be about like dealing with the information set you have and constructing the solution from the information you have.
And as an approach to Obra Dinn alike, or an Outer Worlds alike, you know, or, you know, detective games of that ilk, it definitely has its own shape and structure and its own sort of thing to say, its own kind of tone, which I'm really up for. Like, this wasn't on my radar at all, but I thought it was great. Even in this limited area, you know, the mystery was branching out in all these different directions.
Like, the narrative set up is that there's a big seance going on in the hotel, so it's naturally full of mystics and non-believers and frauds and the hotel staff rich and poor. It's a great set up. And, you know, I don't know if this was just for the demo or if this is how it will play in the game, but pretty early on it has this one scene where it suddenly like introduces you to like 18 people who are all in the same room.
And it feels very exciting as a mystery space to be in. You know, it does feel like a Agatha Christie country manor house murder in a way which I haven't really seen done in a game before. So, yeah, I'm really hopeful about this.
I hope like the final game can land the idea because it's got a lot of potential.
It's about as you as a video game gets this.
Yeah, hugely.
It's to the point where I think that I actually think that the game is quite hard to explain because the core idea of like the what you're solving, that's easy to explain, but the actual what you do and how you solve the mystery, it's like it's pretty intricate, you know? Yeah, and it's hard to sell in a Steam blurb basically. I'm looking at the Steam page.
I would never have guessed that it would be the same developers as Dark Side Detective. Like the visual style is like, obviously it's a 3D game. It's closer to something like Brute Blueprints in visual style than it is those other games.
So yeah, but very cool. You're not the only person who's recommended this. I've seen this pop up, I think.
I think maybe Noclip put this in their top 10 demos from Steam Next Fest. So yeah, really interesting. And I'm glad that people keep making games that appeal to you.
Things about solving murders, because I know that versions of that that are not just straight point-and-click adventures really appeal to you. So I'm pleased. Do you feel like you're being pandered to with these kind of games, Matthew?
Definitely. I mean, in a moment I'll talk through some less successful attempts at this. But yeah, I'm particularly interested to see someone do a detective game where there are a few more restrictions.
Like most of these games, like the kind of golden rule that unites them all is that they'll give you all the time and space in the world to actually work out what's going on. Like it almost seems a bit unfair or unappealing to put any kind of time pressure on it or say that, you know, here's a mystery and you're only going to see half the mystery, you know, half the clues, and you're going to have to solve it. And it's more that that kind of catches my imagination.
Like how are they going to make that work? You know, is there a version of this game where you blunder around a hotel for two days and come out the other end with like not a clue of what happened? Or is it going to naturally kind of shepherd you towards certain solutions?
Or, you know, is there going to be a lot of side content around the edges that you maybe want to investigate on repeat plays? Yeah, a lot of interesting ideas for sure. So yeah, I'm definitely up for it.
I played a lot of demos which were just quite poor rip-offs of existing detective games. But I'll point out a couple of those in a bit.
Yeah, okay. So, I mean, this game's out very soon, right? This is out end of October.
So I assume you'll get a key and talk about it.
Well, hopefully, yeah. I mean, I'll certainly buy it if not, if anyone from Rua Fury is listening, come on.
Yeah, that's really cool. I look forward to hearing what you think of it. I feel bad for them almost that they're releasing it such a fucking busy time of year.
This year has also been just absolutely crazy for notable indie. So there's been a lot going on, especially at this time of year. So cool.
Okay, well, that game again is The Seance of Blake Manor. So yes, hopefully. And my game was called Evil Egg and Skate Story.
Very different.
I've got two more games I'll wrap up with, Matthew. Did you play Cairn in the end?
I did play a little bit of it, yeah.
I played a little bit of it as well. Not too much. Just the opening few sections of it.
So this reminded me of the conversation we had when we discussed Death Stranding and Baby Steps and the idea of different elements of games that you used to take for granted being boiled down into these intricate experiences where just the act of moving is the game. Climbing is not something you would think about when playing a PS2 game, for example, in most cases. It's just something that you do alongside many other things.
But we had Juice On a few years ago, a game I really liked and that Joe Scribbles recommended and was on Game Pass for a while. I think it was in a Humble Bundle recently and it is a fantastic three to five hour narrative-driven, a little bit climbing game, but more about the vibes. So here comes this game, Cairn, from the Game Bakers who are responsible for Fury, which is a hack and slash game that people really liked a few years ago, and Haven, an RPG about a couple that people seem to really not like.
That didn't quite click in the same way. But an interesting developer in that they do something different each time. This is a climbing game where you basically control every single limb, where you're climbing surfaces.
And it's a game where you have to be conscious of the pressure being put on each limb. So finding a surface to rest each limb on is key, as you're moving gradually upscaling the side of a cliff. And yes, you're scaling really quite huge surfaces in this.
And when you climb up a certain way, you hammer in one of those little things that let's you basically access a checkpoint, that's it. And if you fall, then you have a place to kind of continue from. But there's a lot of peril to the game, a lot of physicality, a lot of like, I guess, sim-based elements to it.
It's precise in a way that I don't know if any climbing game has been this precise before. There's a little bit of co-op to it, just in terms of how you manoeuvre the character. You know, a little bit of cross-over with Juice On.
If you like Juice On, I think you'll like what this is. Play just a little bit of it, Matthew, but it seemed like it was a pretty good version of what it was going for. And it looks nice as well.
What did you make of it?
Yeah, I think the look of it definitely helps. Like it's a proper 3D mountain for you to kind of climb. And you can, you know, as long as the surface has hand grips, you can start climbing anywhere and really kind of plan your route up.
And it's got that thing where the physicality of the body is absolutely amazing. Apart from like 2% of the time where it like looks goofy as shit, like you can kind of get her to bring her leg up like way too high and it'll try and kind of accommodate you. Like there's, it's sort of like, you know, 80% physics simulated and 20% sort of game magic to kind of help it happen.
And just occasionally the body will do something loopy. So I was often laughing at just how ridiculous the body looked. But I thought this had way more going on for it than the climbing in Deuxant, which was not as simulated in this way.
And yeah, the core action of the game is great and really works. It's just one of these things I think I have to put more time into. Look, I'm interested in what the bigger sort of systems are.
Like you can sort of camp as you go up the mountain and cook recipes for yourself and give yourself little stat boosts. And that kind of like management of your body and your well-being and your stamina and health and energy or whatever. Like that stuff I didn't completely get my head around in the demo.
Like how much more there was beyond just the climbing. But I get the feeling there's quite a bit from how thought out that camping system was.
Yeah, certainly. I think they're dialing up the peril a lot more than DuSaint was. I will defend the climbing in DuSaint by saying that it's not going for Sim in quite the same way this is.
But yes, it's the fact that there's tension on individual limbs. Like if you are not resting them on a surface, if you put them on a flat surface, you can only hold like a foot or an arm on a flat surface for a certain amount of time before you really need to grip on to something. And so once you get your head around that, you start seeing every wall as a puzzle where you're maneuvering every limb very carefully and, you know, you realize that, oh, if I want to continue climbing upwards, I really need to climb sideways to this bit where there are more footholds, basically.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think you're right. In that respect, they've really smartly thought it out.
There's some amazing bits where, like you reach the sort of extreme of your reach and, but you can almost push through it sometimes and she'll like stretch up and she'll stretch her limbs and like her legs will start shaking. She's on her tiptoes and her hands shaking. She can't quite purchase on the rock and it just, yeah, that's like pretty amazing, both as like game feel and like animation.
I mean, the sense of this like body that has its limits, but you can sort of feasibly go through them if you want to risk it. That's really interesting. And I can imagine it taking you to some quite hairy places or just the decision to hammer in a pit on and basically give yourself a sort of like a grip or a place to rope into to sort of save your progress.
Like that's a cool risk reward thing. We'll properly be able to relive the opening of Mission Impossible 2, which is all I've ever wanted.
I know, your favorite film of all time, I believe.
Hey, the bit where he climbs up the rocks is good. That's good. Tom Cruise climbing is all right.
Yeah. You know what's interesting playing this is I have not looked into the developer interviews that they might answer this, but this could be a game that's anywhere between like a three hour kind of experience to like a I could see it be like 12 to 15 hours where it becomes so intricate and you have to think about so many different systems to kind of get up a mountain, like where you play certain things and the risks you take and like a jump that you might have to make or a different surface you have to deal with, that it kind of goes on and on like it. It's hard to tell.
It's also hard to tell how narrative focused it will be, but I will say that based on Fury and Haven, it seems like they're quite interested in story as a studio, so I imagine that will be a key part of it. There are like little cutscenes in this demo. So hard to say, but certainly interesting.
I only played it briefly because I played it and thought, you know what, I will definitely play this when it comes out. So, you know, like they've got the core systems right, I'm in, so I'll come back to this when it releases.
I hope that eventually you reach the summit and then there's an epilogue where you go and do motivational speaking at future conferences, telling everyone how they got to keep climbing or die.
Yeah, I kind of hope that there's a system where, a bit like Everest, you have to climb past bodies that are frozen in the mountains. But don't you think that would be... There's definitely a game that's done that in recent years, I've forgotten the name of.
We might even have discussed it in the podcast. There was a mountain game, a mountaineering game that did that.
There was a... I swear when I started this demo up, it mentioned that there was ghosts of other players, but I didn't know if that was just like a... almost like a time trial ghost, or if you'd find their remains on the mountain.
Certainly, I turned that on and it was fucking hell on earth. There was about 80 different ghost lads, just all popped out of my character and started climbing all those tutorial walls. And I was like, absolutely not.
I went out to the menu and turned it on. So I think it's strictly that kind of ghost, I think, as opposed to... But I just think that it's...
It's a reality of mountain climbing, is that people don't make it. And I just think that if you're going to simulate that in some way, then that kind of touch might really shake you as a player and be authentic to the thing. I'm not saying I'm craving seeing dead bodies.
I'm just saying it might be an interesting narrative touch.
Even if they had an Iron Man difficulty mode with permanent death, if you die on that mode, your body should be left on the mountain as a marker. So when you come across a body, you're like, that's someone who died a permanent death on the hardest difficulty, and so it becomes a tribute to them.
Yeah, and they should get to leave a last message like Dark Souls style, just sort of like, I froze to death, or I ran out of noodles, or something like that. Or like, bag contains coins, or something like that. Yeah, some kind of system, that would be really fun.
Yeah, I like that sort of thing, but hard to say, because when you watch the trailer, there's definitely a mix of weather that you deal with and surfaces. It seems like there's quite a lot going on in there. It's out Q1 2026, so a bit of time yet, but this certainly feels like one of the chosen few from the Steam Next Fest.
It felt like they were pushing it pretty hard. So, Cairn, C-A-I-R-N, I think it's coming to consoles as well as PC, Matthew. My last game was Ambrosia Sky, which is the game I was the least sure about before I started playing it.
Do you know what this one is?
No idea.
Okay, so they've kind of turned Powerwash Simulator into a sci-fi narrative like first-person shooter kind of game. So in this demo, there are three different missions. The first one you do is like their version of a Metroid Prime's incredible opening mission, where you go on to a space base.
This big fungus creature thing has taken over the base and killed all the people on it. And you've been sent to basically chemically clean this thing out to eliminate this thing from this living space. And so you go through these corridors, you're reading these notes about what happened to this place, who lived there.
You find a body and you collect some kind of objective and you think you've stopped the spread of this thing. And then, and as you go, you literally have the Power Wash Stimulator thing of changing your nozzle. You can have a more powerful version of the spray, the Power Wash, but it's finite, the amount of the powerful one that you've got.
All this stuff that you might be familiar with from Power Wash Stimulator, but you're cleaning out fungus and these electric tentacle plant things and other bits and pieces like this alien crust from the environment. So you get to the end of these space corridors, and your character is like, I think I've cleaned out this creature. Then suddenly everything starts growing back from the walls.
It's like you've woken up the thing that was spreading all this on the ship. So suddenly all the corridors are closing it around you with more of this alien crust. You're like, you're told, get out of there.
You kind of have to run out, Metroid Prime style and just get off of this base thing. That's the first mission of three in this demo. I will say I was really skeptical.
So I'm not a Power wash simulator guy. I respect what it is. But it's like I played it and I was like, nah.
I know this is someone's preferred time sync, but it's not mine. I know some people really got into it. But I did think I'd hate this because the storytelling is very sincere in like an indie game from 10 years ago kind of way.
Like your main character is just very emotional the whole time she's exploring these ships. Like you go into the apartment of some guy she knew and she's like, Gerald, I can't believe you held on to this email I sent you 10 years ago. Like there was a time where I felt so close to you and that kind of very sincere, overly emotional, sentimental indie game writing that feels a little a tiny bit out of date to me personally.
But I thought that the actual gameplay part was really good. The levels don't last very long. They're all about 10 to 20 minutes.
And I quite like the idea of having different objective based, almost like FPS levels. But the FPS bit is like power wash simulator, but sometimes you'll be an anti-grav and sometimes you'll have like different explodey plants that you can fire off at the different sort of like alien crusts that's on the walls. And even these like little monsters that pop up eventually and fire these spores at you.
And you've got like this grappling hook, so you can grapple on to any part of the environments around you and then, you know, reach a part that's got like a, you know, some kind of like seeds that you need to harvest. So you're sort of like dangling from a ceiling, but you're spraying all around this seed so you can collect it. And they thought through the mechanic side of it pretty well.
And so I thought I would hate this and actually thought it was pretty decent. So the only bummer with it is that they're releasing it episodically and I don't know why they're doing that. Like it's like called Act One, Ambrosia Sky Act One, and it's out on the 10th of November.
But I just want it to be like the whole thing. I want it to be, I want to give the whole thing a go. I don't want to play a chunk of it and then come back in a few months.
I don't have that kind of appetite for it. But what they've got is actually pretty cool. And I think that some people are really digging it.
So yeah, any thoughts on them?
I've just looked up some screens of it. It looks pretty nice.
Yeah, it's got this very hyper-colourful art style. I wonder if it's the sort of thing that people like, like this or a clean-up simulator might like. It's very, very colourful.
Like it's sort of like purples and greens and sort of looks like a trippy sort of like taking drugs sequence from a 70s film or something. Yeah, that kind of like sci-fi visual style to it. And then outside of the mission, you have like all these progression layers where you can, yeah, like customise the way that you interact, the way that your sort of like power wash abilities interact with the different plants.
So it allows you to harvest resources a bit easier or like getting more powerful or different types of sort of like power wash things you can unlock. I'm sorry to keep saying power wash when we're talking about sci-fi games.
I'd rather you kept saying power wash than crust and seed. So...
But it's literally just like the power wash simulator mechanics just welded to a sci-fi game. But that's a pretty cool idea if you ask me.
I just don't think I can play video games about pretend cleaning. Because if Catherine caught me, she'd be so gross that I'm willing to clean up a virtual space but I am so filthy in my living space.
I know what you mean. It's a little bit yard work simulator isn't it? But that's Simpsons joke.
Yeah, she's like why don't you actually go and do The Back Garden? And I'm like, you know.
I think there's a certain type of person who might really like this though. So yeah, I liked it more than I thought I would. So yeah, a bit of an unexpected highlight from-
And that's Space Crust 5000, that's cool.
Space Crust Act 6.2. So yes, look forward to that. Ambrosia Sky Act 1 by a developer called Soft Rain.
So I know nothing about them but they sure like making me listen to dialogue while I'm hosing down alien crust. So good for them, Matthew. And those are the games.
Those are the demos that we played during Steam Next Fest. And we've got a few duds here to finish us off. Matthew, what are your duds?
Well, I've got a trio of duds that I'm going to group together that I would say they were all clones of things which I really like, but were not particularly amazing versions of them. There was the Confidential Killings, which is basically Golden Idol in that it's static crime scenes. You collect words and then you fill in the gaps.
But it was quite like wordy, like a lot of the clues were letters and notes. And it just made me realize actually how Golden Idol is incredibly stripped back. You know, there's a couple of lines of dialogue per scenario and it's mostly like visual clues and just a lot more sophisticated in how it constructs its mysteries.
So the Confidential Killings had quite a cool, almost like comic book-y art style. It reminded me of visually that comic book we did for the Excel episode about like the noir-ish film one. You gave it to me.
It was like a guy, he does like mystery comic books.
Oh, Ed Brubaker.
Yeah. So it's quite like that visually. That's his sort of style, which is obviously very distinct.
And yeah, so it kind of had, it reminded me a bit of that, which I did like, but I thought the mysteries were pretty soft.
Hmm, bummer.
Then there was a game called A Case of Fraud, which was quite like The Root Trees, which was that game where you had to fill in a huge family tree from earlier in the year.
Oh yeah.
Where Root Trees has like a in-game search engine that you type in terms to look up like fictional websites and whatnot. This game just gave you a big pile of clues to work through. Like there was no search engine.
It was like, here are 20 documents. All the answers are in that. And I thought like, well, I quite enjoy scouring documents for clues, but it felt quite crude compared to Root Trees.
So that was a bit of a no from me dog. And that works on two levels because it was about a missing dog.
Very good, Matthew.
And my last slightly unsatisfying detective game was called Psycho Sleuth, which is basically a Danganronpa clone, like Ace Attorney, but very, very hectic, with more of an arcadey bent to it and time limits and a bit more stress and pressure when you're presenting the evidence. Lift some mechanics wholesale from Danganronpa, the way that you construct the mystery at the end of a case out of a comic book and things like that. And I like these things enough that I happily played like an hour of it.
I played like a whole case of this demo, but it also just made me think as did the other two. Like the thing that inspired this is just so much better than this. And that's always a bit of a bummer.
You know, it's like this is what would happen if I made a game based on the games I liked. You know, it would just be a slightly fucked version of it.
Oh, that's savage. Do you know what kind of links those three games also? Is they all had very uninspiring titles.
The Seance of Blake Manor is quite evocative, I think, as...
I played The Seance of Blake Manor after playing these three. And so going from that of feeling quite like, there's not really a lot going on in the detective game space at the moment. You were like, oh, here's the thing.
Here's a new idea. Someone is doing something a bit different. It was such a relief.
If you told me that The Confidential Killings was a lesser Higashino, but I would have been like, that tracks, you know what I mean? I think so, yeah. Interesting.
Okay. What's your other dud, Matthew? You got one more here, right?
Mosaic of the Strange?
Oh, I've got two. I've got one called Switchboard, which is where you work for a telephone switchboard, connecting calls. And it's a bit of a, I don't know if it's like an efficiency puzzle.
It's a bit of like a narrative puzzle game where, I guess a bit like Papers, Please, where you're presented with the tools to do a job and then you have to connect calls. And like sometimes people will ring up and they don't have the number. So you have to look in a little book to find the number.
But I thought this was really, really boring. It's set in England at, I don't know, whenever they had switchboards, 1950s? I don't know.
Some quite ropey voice acting in this, like, to the level where different voice actors have different quality mics, like certain characters sounded like they existed in a completely different space to the others. I thought that was quite rubbish. So I was umming and ahhing about whether even to mention it, because it's like a tiny little thing, like why dump on it, right?
But I played it and didn't like it.
A switchboard in theory has some narrative potential. Do you ever see that film The Vast of Nights, where that woman is manning that radio, I think she's manning a switchboard for a radio station, and then some kind of alien thing happens. It's like a prime video film during COVID.
Yeah, it rings a bell. I have seen that.
Yeah. It's got a lot of potential as an idea, you know, a core idea.
The tactility of slotting in the things, and like the illicit nature of like, you can listen in on the calls by pressing a button. And there seems to be a mechanic where you could like jot down, if anything bad was said in a call, like you could pass it on to your supervisors. But yeah, I didn't really get what it was going for.
It felt a bit mundane to me. So yeah, I dumped that off pretty quickly. And the last one was a game called Mosaic of the Strange, which should have absolutely been up my street.
It's a murder mystery game where to find the clues, you play a massive game of Minesweeper. You zoom in on the clue, and there's a hole where the clue should be in the picture, and that hole becomes a Minesweeper grid. Except, I just like playing really boring Minesweeper with this irritating music in the background.
But the murder mystery also seemed quite severe and unpleasant, given the quite frivolous nature of Minesweeper. You know, I'm like having fun playing Minesweeper, and then we zoom out, and it's all like, oh, it looks like his vertebrae has been cleaved in half, and you're like, oh, good.
That is wild. I can't even begin to really understand how these things fit together, and that's crazy.
And it looks cartoony, it looks like Thimbleweed Parks. You think it's gonna be funny, but in the actual tone of it, it's quite unpleasant. Yeah, Minesweeper, yeah.
Also, it's modified Minesweeper rules, where the number itself can also be a mine, if that makes sense, so you can get like a nine, and then it will be all the ones around the outside, and the nine itself, and something about that twist I didn't really like.
Yeah, okay.
I mean, that's niche, but I like, come on, the numbers are sacred, the numbers are never a mine, right? We all know that.
If you told me that you literally dreamt up this game, I think I'd believe you.
No, it's real. Mine sweeper, where the numbers are also mines, and you're solving a surprisingly brutal murder mystery.
And you don't like it. I mean, I can't believe this has happened. What a bummer.
Tell you what, this is another game where I just looked it up. The out of mine sweeper bits look pretty good visually, but the mine sweeper bits, you can only really do so much with it, I guess.
Yeah, it's tough.
Yeah, it's sort of like, yeah, it doesn't quite work, but I wish Mark French with two F's the best. He's the developer of the game.
I think he's made a few of these. I think it's part of a series, so he's obviously onto something.
Could have been you, pal. Could have been you making these games.
Yeah. I'm curious about what your duds are, though.
Yeah, so I've played three duds, I would say. Calling them duds is a bit harsh because I think, but I just didn't really click with them. When you jump into these demos, you can sometimes just not really click with them and just be like, oh, that's a bummer.
But there were two games that I deliberately sought out because I think they were deliberately positioning themselves as Star Fox alikes. So the first one is Death in Abyss, which has the greatest on paper pitch ever, which is it's Star Fox, but a horror game. And so when it starts, you watch this almost alien motion tracker thing of all these different ships in a squadron going through this sector of space and then being blotted out by this red dot.
One by one. And then it kind of like cuts to you in the ship. And then you're flying through this, like, you know, this this part of space, blowing up these eldritch sort of like horror looking things.
But it's not good. The combat is not good. The enemy designs are not very inspiring or scary or interesting.
There's not loads of narrative set up. A lot of it is delivered via the sort of HUD being like, you know, sort of like member one of your squadron squadron deceased. And then it's like, you're the last one still alive.
And then when all of the different sort of smaller enemies turn up, they're just these little amorphous white things that are not very interesting to fight. And it was a real bummer because I saw this got covered by Time Extension. I thought in principle that could be really good, but it just had none of the Star Fox juice.
It didn't feel good to play. There's nothing visually distinctive about it. It just had that it's such a simple thing to just have a ship that looks like an R-Wing in the center of a screen and for your brain to go like, oh, I know this to be a good thing when used properly.
But here it is not.
Is it better or worse than Atari Jaguar's Cybermorph?
Oh, I think I slightly prefer Cybermorph to this one. Slightly better is for Squadron Phoenix, which is a bit more of a furry take on Star Fox, which is, you know, obviously cursed.
I mean, that's already quite a furry game.
It is, but it softens the edges even more. But if I could be... My problem with this one, I think that like the sort of very basic, sort of almost like wireframy visual design of Death in Abyss, I thought was quite quite a smart approach.
It's just the actual minute to minute enemy design was not even vaguely interesting to look at. Like it's the style was right, but the actual designs weren't very good. Here, the style is wrong, and that kind of means that you just can't really click with it.
I would say visually, it looks a bit knockoff Star Fox. Death in Abyss has a bit more originality. This looks a bit like closer to the Gummy Ship sections from Kingdom Hearts, which is really quite a brutal comparison.
The actual like... But again, even though the combat is better than Death in Abyss, it has a lot of the basics of Star Fox. It's just very static feeling, like the set piece design it does.
Just does not have the juice, the sauce or the grit of it. That's like the... And it really just highlights what Lightning in a Bottle Star Fox 64 is.
We talked about how this series has never even really got close to those glory days again. And it's a really hard series to kind of figure out for that reason. But these games that are having an attempt at doing the same thing, they're just not really getting close.
So neither of those worked for me, Matthew.
Yeah. I must admit, adjacent to this, I did a lot of searching through any of my beloved key terms, detective, investigation, mystery. And I kept being offered up, like, there seemed to be like five different detective games where you play as a detective who's also a cat or a dog.
And I just don't ever want to do that. That is so far from, like, I'm just not interested in animals killing each other. It's all, you know, there's an inheritance dispute, but it's about some fucking gerbils or something.
It's just, it really leaves me cold. There's a lot of animal stuff doing the rounds on Steam. People must love animal games.
That's my observation.
Well, there's loads of, aren't there like multiple games where you play as a frog who's also a detective?
Yeah, I'm a frog detective. It's quite, you know, it's quite throw away, but it's quite fun and meemy. But yeah, I was just surprised by how many things, which the name of it, I was like, oh, that sounds good.
And then I clicked on a screenshot of it and there's like a fucking cat in a fedora and I'm like, oh, no.
Yeah, it's funny, actually, that's I've been put off of that kind of thing ever since I tweeted about reading the Blacksad comics, which are really good, but they're like fundamental weakness is that they have like horny female animal designs. So it borders on furry. And like one artist in a games industry gave me a really hard time about how sexist of designs were.
And after that, it just like really colored it for me. That's like, I don't think I could enjoy Blacksad or animals who solve crimes anymore. I think I just have to abandon this whole subgenre.
But yes, I can sort of see where you're coming from. That's funny that those are the games that came up. Someone did recommend to me, a listener said, I should play the game X Zodiac, which is in early access, it was a Kickstarter game.
But it's only like 10 quid and it's more riffs on Star Fox and The Snares, but it's considered a pretty decent riff on Star Fox and even has a bit of Space Harrier vibes about it. So I just think at the end of the day, if I have to go back to playing Star Fox and 3DS, that's not the end of the world. It's hard to replicate what is good about it.
It's just interesting that now this is a game type that's become a battleground, because there's also one that one of the original creators of Star Fox is working on, isn't there?
Yes, that's right. Yeah.
So yeah, it's just interesting. The last dub, Matthew, is Bubsy 4D, which is a revival of the Bubsy franchise in a 3D platformer style, with a bit of the old self-awareness about how duff Bubsy is, and all his little furry friends make fun of what sort of has been is. But it's like a 3D platform with a rancid camera, like a rancid 3D camera.
And I will say the one thing that this has going for it, is that out of all the demos I played, this is the one that reminded me of the old official PlayStation 2 magazine, of like, I've got a demo disc that's got like ICO on it, and then also like Tarzan Freeride, or like Tie the Tasmanian Tiger, or Haven Call of the King, and I will play, which has come up recently, and I will play every game on this demo disc, because I have like, you know, nothing but free time because I'm 13 or 14. And so it did remind me of that at least, and had a couple of interesting things going for it, like character movement wise, you could cover quite a lot of space quite quickly, but there was a fair amount of precision to it. But the camera was so bad, and it's just, when you've played something like Ashdrey Bot in the last year, I can't summon much enthusiasm for it.
I thought, yeah, I just didn't think this was very good, especially because I saw like headlines that were saying, Bubsy's back and he's good this time. And I was like, I don't think so. I think it's like still a six out of 10.
I don't know where it came from, but I got served on Blue Sky. I think it was a headline. It might have been from GamesRadar, actually, that said something like, I've not got room for my heart in for Mario Odyssey anymore because of Bubsy 4D.
And I was just like, oh, my head falls. You know when Homer eats that incredibly sour sweet in at the candy convention, his face folds in on itself. That's what my face did for about five seconds when I read that.
I imagine you are more like that episode where Bart takes that car and goes on that road trip to that wig sphere, and Lisa tells Homer what's going on, that his face goes red, and he puts on that helmet and then just screams into it for a minute, and the little glass window steams up. I imagine that's more what happened to you, Matthew.
You've got a deeper knowledge of the Simpsons, so you're better at the specificity of my emotions. Thank you.
No worries, pal. It's the one thing I can do. I don't know anything else, but I can do that.
I can find a Simpsons moment for whatever emotion you're feeling.
I have no other skills or knowledge. That's it. But alas.
Yeah, so Bubsy 4D, I mean, I didn't think it was very good personally. And I thought that if you're going to bring this back, like you need a bit more of a take, it wasn't quite self-aware enough to be funny. I think if it was going to go down that route, it should have been more of a Conker's Bad Fur Day sort of job, you know, where it's just rancid and cursed in a very pronounced way.
But instead, it's still kind of sincerely trying to be like a 3D platformer that's got Bubsy and some cute characters in it. And it's a no from me dog, except this time there's no actual dog. I don't know what Bubsy is, but I don't think he's a dog.
He's a cat.
So there you go, yeah, the Bobcat, that's it, isn't it? Yeah, I did have that original Bubsy game, but I didn't mind it at the time, but I don't want to see more Bubsy games. I've got this too much else to do, as this episode is illustrated, Matthew.
But I've got an entire moon to eat, come on.
That was fun, wasn't it? What would you say is the real cream of the crop of what you play? If you can pick two or three from what you played where you're like, I've got a really good feeling about this, I'll definitely play this to completion.
What would you say?
The Seance of Blake Manor. Yeah. I've got a good feeling about No More Work For Ito.
I think that's got the juice.
Probably, I don't know, maybe then Opus Prison Peak. Just from a production point of view, it was so flashy, you know?
Yeah. Okay. I think that's really solid.
I mean, I'd say The Killing Stone, Birdcage and Cairn are probably the three where I'm like, I know I'll play those and I know I'll have a good time with those. So yes, but Evil Egg definitely worth it. No justice for Evil Egg.
Evil Egg, I don't need to recommend it. You can just get it for free and see if you like it anyway in like 10 days.
So can I interest you in this Evil Egg?
Can I offer you an Evil Egg at this trying time?
Oh, I'm so bad at my fucking references.
It's late on a Sunday. It's okay. Remember when I couldn't remember the name of Playdead earlier?
That was tough. Care for an Evil Egg. Care for an Evil Egg.
Someone will mock that up now. I enjoyed that. Do you think we should do this again down the line?
Yeah, I think so. Why not?
Yeah. It's just about doable within a week's time frame, I think. So it passes the test of The Back Page Episode Production, Matthew.
Where can people get you on social media?
I'm at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us.
Get two additional podcasts a month. This month we played some NES games. And also we're doing an episode all about the films Matthew mentioned earlier.
We've done a little film festival thing. So we're going to make an episode about that and that'll be out the following Monday when you're listening to this. And yeah, that's basically all the stuff that we do.
And we're on social media at BackPagePod as well on both Twitter and Blue Sky. Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
