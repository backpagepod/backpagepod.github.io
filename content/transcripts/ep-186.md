Hello, and welcome to The Back Page: A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. How's it going on this mid-week, rainy Wednesday? We did it, we defeated Summer.
Are you happy about that?
Yeah, I am, though. It's very, like, the air is sort of moist, which isn't good conditions for a larger man. Yeah, it's fine.
Let's not dwell on that, it's fine.
Yeah, and I realised we were recording this on a Tuesday as well. I said that after I said Wednesday.
That's fine, I didn't even notice, that's fine.
Good. Matthew is mentally depleted going into this. It's a mailbag, so to give you maximum value, rather than have any more preamble, we'll go straight into the questions, Matthew.
So, very fast turnaround here. Do you want to read out this first one?
Hi, lads, simple question. What are your favourite Metroidvanias? Bought on by Matthew calling it such a competitive genre on the Discord.
Cheers, that's from Balladeer. Is that a weirdly confrontational question?
Do you think so? I don't know.
It's kind of like, because you called it such a competitive genre, as if there's doubt in that. I don't know.
I don't know. I think what you said is demonstrably true. This year, there's been quite a large number of these games.
There's been the Prince of Persia one, which I really liked, Lost Crown. There's been that game Ultros, which has seen getting a few recommendations of late. And of course, is it Tales of Kinsera or Kinsara?
One of those two.
Your favorite, Animal Well.
Animal Well. Yeah, exactly. That's four.
Those are all Game of the Year contenders, arguably. And they've all come out in the first half of the year. So I would say that is competitive.
I will say as well, a friend of the pod, Jay Bayless, has a good observation of Metroidvanias, which is the reason there are so many of them is because they are quite cheap to make. And you can make them well without spending that much money, basically. So I quite like that take.
And I also think that's partly why in such a competitive genre, a lot of the more recent ones have been getting prominence, so those that have a bit of elevated presentation. So your Animal Wells and Metroid Dreads and the like. Prince of Persia is a really obvious example of this.
Ultros has the Hotline Miami artist worked on it. I don't know their name. Sorry about that.
I didn't know that down. But I think that side of things means that it's true that you can make a really pared down one visually, and it be as good in theory as some of these other ones. But I do like the presentational upside.
And I must say personally, I'm a bit newer to this genre. Like I don't know it nearly as well as Matthew does. And so I think Metroid Prime was the first one I played.
So I kind of almost had to reverse engineer what a 2D Metroidvania was from one of the only real 3D ones. So that was kind of interesting. But from you Matthew, a genre expert, what do you think?
I wouldn't necessarily say I am a genre expert. I mean, the games that I like in the genre, they're all pretty basic bitch picks and ones that I've talked about loads on the podcast. Like, I feel like there's always a lot of traffic behind best Metroidvania as a search term, you know, if you if you look it up.
Because I think people are hoping that there's a load of secret ones that they haven't heard of, that people are always typing in Metroidvanias hoping that, oh, somehow one slipped through the cracks, which can happen in this day and age, you know, especially on Steam, where they release five million games every day. You know, there are these sort of sleeper hits that slip through the cracks. So maybe that's where it comes from.
But, you know, so it feels pretty redundant for me to go, oh, Ori and the Blind Forest is good. Animal Well is good. Castlevania, Daughter of Sorrow is good.
Metroid Dread. Blasphemous. You know, those are all 2D Metroidvanias I've really enjoyed.
Interestingly, like the 3D ones, which are rarer, but Supraland I really liked on PC, which I think counts as a Metroidvania in terms of collecting abilities and backtracking, you know, based on those basic criteria. If it's Jedi Survivor, I'd say just about counts.
That's interesting. I suppose it is. Yeah.
You know, in terms of, you know, I feel like it's leaning into that. And certainly in that central planet of Kobo in the last, yeah, sorry, do you know why I got distracted there? When I said Kobo, it reminded me of, I wrote a script for a video about Jedi Survivor, and throughout the video, the person reading it pronounced it Koba.
I had to go back and re-record it. That popped into my head and it distracted me from my own point, which was in the central planet of Kobo. I feel like they had that design that you'd go out to other planets and then you come back to this place and every time you came back, your powers would unlock new corners of it, but also recontextualise places you'd already been.
I actually thought that map did unfold quite brilliantly in lots of different directions as the game went on, so I think that counts. But I'm afraid I don't have a secret Metroidvania which you haven't played.
That's okay, I don't think they're asking for that, I think they just want to know what you think the top of the tier is. It's not like we've talked about the genre in bits and pieces, we've never done an episode just on that genre or one series on that genre, so yeah, but you think it's quite self-evident what the really good ones are.
Yeah I think so, and I think they're always kind of rolling along that it always feels like a genre in good health, which is probably what I was referring to when I said it was a competitive genre. I think it's because that Tales of Kinsera was slightly weaker, I think that's what this was in relation to, that I just felt like it is so competitive that, you know, merely being fine, which I think that game is, kind of wasn't quite enough, you know, like there are so many good examples of it, specifically this year, but also just generally I think it's a genre where if you're a fan of Metroidvanias, you're better fed than say if you're a fan of detective games, for example, you know, which is another thing I really like, but I feel like I can go longer without playing a really good one of those.
That makes sense. Plus, you've always got, you know, your sort of like odd Square Enix ones that pop out of nowhere and just sort of like end up having really high production values and stuff. So, oh, the detective games front that is, rather than Metroidvanias.
Yeah, eight mysteries of Honjo Wen.
Speaking of which.
Yeah, okay. If you could invite any three Square Enix characters to a dinner party, who would you invite and why? That's from Betamax Bandit, a beloved mod of the Discord, puts up with all kinds of rubbish in there.
So good for her. Okay, Matthew. What have you got for this one?
As someone who's less, I guess, au fait with the whole Square Enix thing.
Well, I've picked some detectives. I've picked Jun Iriu, the pouty lipped cop from Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, who I picked because I like his pouty lips. He's just got good energy.
And I wanted to say Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo because I know it tickles you.
It makes me laugh every time. And every time, have you noticed every time in the Discord, someone says Paranormal Sight, I respond with The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, question mark, every single time. And I make myself laugh and no one else.
Well, I'm glad it's good to, you know, if it works for you, that's great. I'm also picking the crime author protagonist, The Centennial Case, my god, I'm a broken record, Haruka Kagami, which is a name I've said definitely in the last two weeks on this podcast. I can't remember when Centennial Case came up.
Oh, it was in our Excel episode about limited run draft.
I have no memories of recording that episode.
Yeah, I definitely picked Centennial Case because my special item that I was going to package in with it was a new crime novel written by Keigo Higashino, like writing as this fictional author who I'd be invited to by dinner parties. So I mean, some people might frown on me inviting basically a load of detectives and cops to a dinner party, but you know that they're going to have some like crazy fucked up anecdotes about like crime scenes. You know, I'd love to pick the brains of like a genuine like murder, murder cop.
So this is the easiest way of doing that. And finally, Ignis, the chef from Final Fantasy 15, to do the cooking, which is that bad form to invite a cook to do the cooking at your dinner party?
No, I had Ignis as one of mine.
Oh, nice.
So I'm disappointed that we crossed over there, but yeah, no, I think that makes sense. Ignis is also, the thing is, I stopped and really thought about it. And I think that a lot of the Final Fantasy characters are good characters in a Japanese RPG, but not good hangs, you know.
So, for example, the vast majority of FFVII party members are, I would say, not necessarily good hangs. A lot of people want to spend a lot of time within an intimate party setting to really kind of pick their brains. Do you know what I mean?
Who do you think is least messed up by the journey they've been on? Like assuming it's post-Final Fantasy VII.
So specifically, oh, after FFVII.
Yeah, who do you think is the least haunted member of the party? Probably the best hang after all they've been through.
I mean, Cat Sith is still a fucking doll. Do you know what I mean? Like there's like, and Reeve, the guy who controls the doll, is not there in the battle.
So I think in theory, it would be, or Cat Sheath, or however you're meant to pronounce it. But yeah, I don't know. It's, I think that's probably accurate.
You've not finished FFVII, have you? So.
Well, no, but I have, I have, through various means, seen a lot of it now. So I am, I am kind of aware of most of what goes down. I still think Tifa's the one you invite.
Yeah, she's, she's all right. I was just wondering if Tifa feels a bit sort of in second place generally on that journey. I mean, I guess I haven't finished Rebirth, so maybe that's reframed the whole Tifa thing.
But yeah, I think like the story, the story doesn't have loads for Tifa to do in FFVII, like after the initial Midgar bit really. And once you resolve the flashbacks in Nibelheim, there's not loads going on specifically with Tifa. Like, I mean, she slaps Scarlet on top of the Dune in Cannondale, but I'm not sure she has loads else to do.
So I don't know. I mean, some of the characters resolve their shit, don't they? So Red 13 might be all right.
Oh, I'm not. I am. If you think I'm inviting a freaking dog to a human dinner party, absolutely not.
Yeah, fair enough. I like, Barrett has sorted his thing out with dying, hasn't he? So he might be all right.
Vincent's a vampire, so I don't really know if he eats anything.
Yeah, but he also, I don't know if I'm just making this connection because he lives in like a posh house, but I can see him...
Having manners.
Having manners, yeah, basically. I could see him like understanding kind of fine dining in a way that some of the others are just, I don't know, they just haven't had time to like develop that part of their lives, you know?
Yeah, euphy too annoying. Cid might be all right, but Cid's again a bit like Barrett-esque where he's a bit much, you know what I mean? And you're like, I don't know if I just need a little bit of a pause from Cid.
Well, we've really thought about this in detail, haven't we? And I guess I should answer the question too, Matthew. So I sort of thought for a good hangs dinner, I would invite all three retailers from Final Fantasy X.
So, Owaaka the 23rd, his little brother who takes over the shop when Owaaka gets put in prison for, I don't know, religious crimes or whatever the fuck's going on in FF10, I don't remember. And Rin, the albed dealer who hangs out on the airship and is like an absolute good hang. They are like some of the best hangs in FF10 for sure.
That's another one where, thinking about the party, there's not many party members I'd want along to that dinner. Kimari, I don't think so. Definitely not Owaaka and definitely not Tina.
It's like maybe Yuna. She's quite inoffensive though, so I don't know. It's sort of like, I really had to weigh this up.
So yeah, the three retailers would be like my good hang dinner. But more sincerely, I guess, to take the question out of sort of face value, I would invite Lulu from FF10. Severe yet insightful.
And there may be other upsides I won't go into. This is not a horny podcast.
Is that the thing with the huge tongue?
Lulu's like the... Lulu's the very gothy woman with the dress made of bells.
Oh, wait, no, I think of Final Fantasy IX. What's that thing called?
Uh, dunno. FF9's the one I don't know much about.
It looks like a chef with a huge tongue in my head.
I know who you're talking about, but I just don't know the name of the chef with the huge tongue.
I don't know.
I'm not just inviting chefs to my dinner party. Frog from Chrono Trigger. He is a frog man, but he used to be a human, so I think he would still have good manners even though every now and then he might do that frog thing where he does the long tongue Jar Jar Binks thing.
Oh, like comically eats a fly that's buzzing around someone's head.
Exactly, yeah, and I have to do the Qui-Gon Jinn thing of going, don't do that again kind of thing.
It is a classic classic half human half frog man thing to do at a dinner party.
It is, but the whole thing with frog is that he's very much not into the frog thing. He's like, I've got to turn back into a human and win back this woman who I'm into. That's his whole thing.
Yeah, but then I just don't want him talking about that the whole time we're at dinner because that would bum everyone out. You can get the whole shape of that quite quickly. You don't need to keep hearing about it.
I maintain that frog is a good hang in Chrono Trigger. He was always in my party, so I was very fond of him. And then I think Ignis from FF15 to Cook would be the other one.
So again, you picked that one. But he's also like, again, I thought about those boys in FF15. Prompto is a bit too similar to my little brother.
He's a bit in your face and a photographer, my brother. And I'm like, this character is too similar to you. I just, I can't really be doing with you.
No offense to my brother. But, and then there's Gladiolus, who's a little bit too. I never liked to be sat next to men who look that much beefier or more handsome than me.
I try and avoid that. So that's one thing. Not sure about Noctis and yeah.
Who's the other one? Is that all of them? Yeah, that's all of them.
Gladiolus has got the same sort of thing as Barrett and Sid in that I just don't know that they'd want to be at the dinner party, you know?
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, is it not their vibe, you know?
No, they'd be out on the, they'd definitely be out on the patio smoking like a fat cigar, but they wouldn't like, they try and get out of the dining room pretty quickly.
I think Barrett would also make sure that my, the meal that we're cooking is sustainable and not doing damage to the planet. And I'd be able to look, man, we've got to serve some steak here. You know, what can I tell you?
That's just the way it is. So, okay, we've answered that one, Matthew. So, we move on to the next one.
Do you want to read this out?
There is a back pod hashtag collab with a new Def Jam game. What are your rapper names? This is inspired by MC Cupcake, which was, who was MC Cupcake?
I've completely blanked.
I don't know, who is that?
Oh, that's Rachel. Rachel Webber was.
Oh, of course. Yeah, it was. I typed in MC Cupcake and got no relevant responses.
Sorry, that was it. She was MC Cupcake.
Yeah.
That's from Welsh Boy Mick, which sounds like, could that be a good rapper name?
That was good, yeah. Did you think about this, Matthew? Did you have an answer for this?
I had MCMC, because it's my initials.
That's good. I like that, that's good.
And I have a, so at work, this might be a bit cringe, but I'm quite fond of it. They all call, or a lot of them call me Sweet C.
What's that based on? Because you like sweeties.
No, because my surname C, and I guess it's a riff on the, it's always sunny in Philadelphia character, Sweet D. Oh, right. Matt Elliott called me Sweet C one time, and it stuck.
But I actually don't mind it, because I've never really had a nickname beyond Castle. So I feel like the nickname bridges the gap between me being like a bit older than, a lot of the staff are more like in their 20s, but the nickname kind of, I don't know, makes me more palatable in a way.
As opposed to an old bastard who no one likes, basically.
Well, as opposed to an old bastard who's like, please call me Matthew, you know. They're like, hey, Sweet C. And you're like, that's all right.
They write in my birthday card and stuff. I quite like it. But I think Sweet C is not a bad name for a rapper.
That's nice, but I do think the listeners will now call you Sweet C for the rest of time.
No, and they're not allowed to, because it's a nickname that I have with my work colleagues. You have to be invited into a nickname. You can't just, if you overhear someone calling you, you can't just adopt it.
And I do not invite the listeners into it.
I'm very fond of your work, Slack. I've just about McFuckingHadit reaction thing. That's maybe half multiple times.
McFuckingHadit, yeah.
Yeah, that's good.
Did I tell you about the variations on McFuckingHadit?
No, I did hear about this from another person who works there, but why don't you tell me a bit about it?
So for people who don't know, why would you? We have lots of little emojis in Slack, and one of them is a picture of a very tired looking Ronald McDonald, and the name of the emoji is McFuckingHadit. But then there are also emojis of other members of staff looking tired, and they are all variations, and they're McFucking and then your name.
So it's like McFucking Chris, so-and-so looking. I just like the idea that people have the same tired energy as the McFuckingHadit Ronald McDonald. Like just that there's certain pictures you see it and someone says, you know what this picture reminds me of?
Tired Ronald McDonald. And then boom, in it goes, emoji time.
That's good. Well done. I mean, you know, that's a good explanation of that whole situation.
So I appreciate that. Where were we?
What's your own rapper name?
So I thought you and I collectively could be called like Lil Giants with a Z. I thought that might work. My one, though, is like, it's like so it's it's Smoked is my name, right?
But before it, in brackets, is Bavarian. So it's like a bit of a cheese kind of like thing. So Bavarian Smoked.
Bavarian Smoked is my name.
Do people always have to say the Bavarian or can they just call you Smoked?
It's optional, but I would prefer they said the Bavarian. You know, it's that's my sort of like request to the people who attend my concerts. I don't know.
You know, the little thing, the little giants.
Yeah.
Because I don't really know people who are called little, whatever, do they tend to be small? Is that what they're referring to? Or is it like an ironic thing?
Is it like calling like, you know, fat guy skinny?
Why are you asking that? Like I would know the answer to why Lil Jon is called Lil Jon.
So I thought, or maybe it's something I've often wondered. And you're the closest person I know to being a rap expert.
Because I've listened to like, Aquem and I by Outkast and The Chronic by Dr. Dre. Lil Jon height. Let's like Google this live.
1.68 meters. So 5'7, 5'8. That's not massively tall.
Let's see. Lil Wayne, similar height, slightly smaller, Lil Scrappy. Not aware of that guy.
He seems a bit taller, to be honest.
Well, I didn't know if it was a height thing or like if it was because they were like another rapper with their name already and so it was like you were their son, like Junior.
What's in this, like, large John, little John?
Well, no, there's Wayne and then there's Lil Wayne.
We are way out of our depth. I am more amused by the idea of a Def Jam game where you and I have to beat the shit out of Sean Paul. That's just really funny.
It's an idea.
We can get John Denton on this podcast to come and sort out this issue for us.
You mean Lil John Denton? Yeah, you're right. We should get John Denton on to talk about that and other things and that'd be good.
I do realise that was the whitest three minutes of The Back Page: there's ever been.
I mean, what about this podcast hasn't been white to date, like, in its entirety? It's the whitest podcast ever. Anyway, okay, brothers, my wife and I would like to plan another UK holiday or vacation if you prefer.
We had a lovely time in Scotland last year and are considering other parts of the country for our next journey. What parts of the UK would you recommend visiting? That's from Butterbeens.
What have you got, Matthew? You're a UK expert. You love the UK.
You know, sad. I know that you are sad that Labour got into government, but what would you recommend on the UK tourist front?
Well, I would suggest going to York. That's very pleasant, and because it has a lot of chocolate factories, it smells of chocolate. It really does.
The smell of chocolate is on the air, and it's nice, you know. Well, I don't know, I'm assuming Butterbeens is American here, instead of planning another UK holiday. I don't know if that's right or not.
Yeah, I think that is right, yeah.
But like, lovely, lovely British chocolate, lovely the smell of that. That's delightful. Also the National Rail Museum, where former NGamer editor Mark Green used to work.
So, if anyone's doing a little kind of pilgrimage of classic NGamer locations, the National Rail Museum is an essential stop. I like York. I actually haven't been to many places in the UK.
Like, I'm a bit of a creature of habit. You know, I haven't holidayed much within the UK. I really like the Jurassic Coast, which is down in Devon.
It's just Devon, but people say Jurassic Coast, because I think it makes it sound more exciting, like Jurassic Park. Welcome to Jurassic Coast.
We just know it's not that exciting.
I mean, there are dinosaurs, but they are dead and very much in fossilised form.
And excavators, so no longer on the coast.
Yeah, but like, you know, you've got like, my parents have a little town called Beer near Seton and Sidmouth. Those are all lovely little lovely little kind of Devon towns. Less touristy and less packed than Lime Regis.
I'm also a big fan of, I used to go on my Easter holidays when I was a child. I used to go to Southwold, which is in... Hmm, where is Southwold?
I'm going to look it up because I don't... People get upset if you get it wrong. Suffolk.
And that's home of Adnum's Brewery. So another place that definitely when I went as a child, I used to smell of brewing and quite hoppy. So I like towns that smell of their industry, basically.
Okay, and as a man who doesn't drink, you don't enjoy the fruit of that either.
No, but I like the smell of it. It's a nice smell.
I used to live next to the bath, Abbey Ales Brewery, where I used to live, like at the top of Bath, basically up the big hill. And it was a nice smell, I must admit, as I walked past it and they were brewing, you know, Mediocabeers in there, but it was pretty good. So, yeah, I echo that York is a really nice place.
Like York is like a more northern bath, basically. You get a bunch of old buildings for your buck, so that's good. Lake District, amazing.
I would say that's an incredible thing to behold if you're happy to sort of drive around. It's not really a get by by train sort of place. The UK in general, if you want to see some really pretty stuff does require a car, unfortunately.
So, you know, you need a Catherine Castle in your life to drive you around, basically. So, that's something. My parents live down in Devon, too.
My parents live in Brixham. They have a little bit of Biosomoros, though, because I think they would rather live down in Loom in Devon, which is a really beautiful place. I think that there's that BBC spin-off of something paradise called Beyond Paradise, and that is filmed in Loom.
So, that's a really, if you Google that town, that's a really nice looking place. So, basically, it's just like about a million nice seaside towns down there. So, that's a good place to go in the summer.
Bit of a write-off in the winter, to be honest, but, you know, such as it is.
I do quite like a bleak coastal resort in the winter, though. Yeah, yeah.
Such a new thing to say.
Well, you know, like walking along the cold, the seafront when it's really cold and the sea's getting up a bit and you've got your coat on. You know, that's quite a nice feeling.
I do like going back there at Christmas, actually. When I go to Bricksham at Christmas, some of the businesses are still open, a lot of them closed, but you can go to a half empty cocktail bar and it's quite rainy outside, you just have a nice drink and sit indoors and go and have some mussels and chips and stuff. Yes, it does have its appeal, I will admit.
If you get the train down there as well, you basically just go, there's some bridges that are just next to the sea and basically the train is being hit by waves, it's that close. That's really cool.
That's nice. Exciting, that's scary.
Yeah, it's good. So that's one upside of going down to Devon as well. So that's a really nice part of the country for sure.
And then, I don't know, it's a bit weird to be like, go to London or whatever. That's much more of an acquired taste and very different. But you know, I enjoy London.
I know Matthew, you sometimes enjoy London. So I don't know, but we've covered quite a lot of areas there, I think. So yeah, do you want to read this next one?
Yeah, that's how you know how you get on Burbeens and send us some biscuits or chocolates from wherever you go. Oh, it's this question. Oh, I didn't really understand this one.
Right, DM Menus and Parkour. All games are now menus or parkour. That's just the truth now, and it has always been the truth.
Which of your favourite games are menus or parkour? Are there any games that look like menus but are parkour? Sekiro is parkour, but Dark Souls is menus.
Forza Horizon is parkour, but regular Forza Motorsport is menus. GameScore is parkour, but console drafts are menus. Thanks!
That's from Dynamic Calories, who also might be the Riddler, because I didn't understand this one bit.
Yeah, so this was a reference to a tweet that did the rounds a while ago. It's always tricky when people ask these questions that are related to something really current, and then when I come to collect the questions through a mailbag two months later, they no longer have their context. It's like the what's it to a girl, that thing.
If you talk about that in three months, it will sound like a fucking foreign language. You won't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what that is now.
Oh yeah, I'll send you a link anyway to explain the whole thing. Thank you. Yeah, no worries, pal.
But it's like referencing something you might recognize, like the Will Smith slap, for example. That's so fucking old. Why would you even bother?
So this meme is like a...
It does. Slaps got legs. Some things have got better legs than others.
I would say the Will Smith slap has longer legs than Menus and Parkour, for sure. So I despise this meme, first of all. I assumed it came from an account that mostly tweeted an all-lowercase, so I was correct.
I looked that up. So on that basis, it should be written off. I like a good capital letter and some punctuation.
Just making that very clear. So yeah, I think I kind of get what they're going for here. So any strategy game would be Menus, right?
But Mirror's Edge is the most parkour example. I think they're talking about the idea that games could... It's a very comically reductive binary, basically, right?
It's like Flow versus Procedure? Yeah. I don't know.
I guess so. But then Secure has got quite a lot of menus. So I don't know.
It's sort of like... I'm slightly confused by it. But I guess my favorite...
Red Alert is Menus, obviously. Then I guess, like, what would be parkour if the game... Cyberpunk is parkour, I guess.
Yeah, I mean, that's the best I've got.
Cyberpunk's quite menus.
Is it? I mean, I've not played it since they've redone it, but I don't feel... I don't feel like I've spent ages in the menus tinkering with, like, RPG stats or equipment.
But does menus literally mean menus?
We're out of our depth here.
I think Mario is parkour.
Oh, Mario's definitely not menus. Maybe like Mario and Rabbids is menus, I don't know.
Yeah. I'd say most Nintendo things are, like, game feel. I like menus.
Oh, I like parkour.
Yeah, that makes sense. And so what about menus, Matthew? What would you pick for that?
Menus. Oh, Britain?
Yeah, that makes sense. Me, me, me games. They're menus, aren't they?
Yes. Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, they're menus. Okay, good.
We did it. We've escaped with our lives. That's good.
Okay, next question, then. I hear you guys refer back to earlier episodes. A lot of shade being thrown at the James Bond episode.
Do you know which episodes have the most listens? And do you have a personal favorite? So I do know the episodes have the most listens.
That's the Game of the Year episodes always do best. So like the 2023 episode was our biggest episode of last year, for example. But all of the episodes we do around like best games 2003, that sort of thing.
They always do really well. People like those. The What We've Been Playing episodes always do well.
I think it suggests that people always enjoy that Contemporary Games Chat. It's a chance to mention, obviously, a newer game in the title of the podcast. So people are kind of more floating listeners see that, and they're like, oh, what do these two idiots think about Stellar Blade or whatever?
And so they can jump in. So there's a bit of that. The drafts also do well.
But those are all the episode types that tend to do well. Interviews tend to do less well. Even if it's a guest who's got a big social following that doesn't tend to translate to listeners, interestingly.
Mailbags do less well. So fitmaker that way you will as you listen to this. Games Court is somewhere in the middle.
It does pretty well for what it is. And yeah, the election special, actually. It actually did pretty great.
It was like the numbers were up week on week. And so people seem to really like the, I guess, like, contemporary sort of, you know, it's going on right now, you know, relevant aspect to that.
Well, as long as they didn't think it was like a serious political podcast that they thought they were going to get some, like, you know, nutrition because they didn't.
There were no hints whatsoever of that podcast. It wasn't a serious endeavor. So it was tough to really call.
But I suppose for the personal favorites front, Matthew, what do you what do you make of this?
I like series Deep Dives. They're probably my favorites. They're always really they take ages to put together.
Like, I love the ones where we've just played a shitload of games and we just have like so so many things to cram into an hour and a half. Those episodes come out really rich. So, like, I loved the God of War one where we played all the God of War games, which was like quite a mad thing to do for one episode.
But I think it really paid off in terms of, like, that episode is just packed with good stuff. You know, even though it's egotistical of me, I like holding court about Nintendo series. I really like the Ace Attorney one.
I was really pleased with the Kirby episode.
The Zelda one was great.
When we did that. They just take ages and we haven't done one of those for a bit.
Yeah, two years, I think.
Well, yeah, I mean, like definitely when we were doing them more, I had a much lighter workload. Like it was like I was still kind of half freelancer and then the job I went into was quite low lift for a bit. But unfortunately now it's like the idea of doing one of those kind of gives me the fear a bit.
I'd need quite a run up, but that's OK. I think we can give ourselves the runway. Like I'm pretty sure we've got like a good episode on Dragon Age in that vein coming from us.
So I'm sure we can do that well.
Yeah, can't replay all the Dragon Ages for that, but you've been playing replaying Inquisition. I've started it. I am planning on getting through it before the new one comes out.
So we'll definitely get do a good episode on that. They announced the Gears game. So that's kind of put that back on our radar as a thing to do.
Definitely gears. Metroid Prime 4 coming out next year. So we'll do Metroid games ranked for that one.
So yeah, I think we'd like to do them. They are longer endeavors, but I enjoy them too, Matthew. Anything else that stands out to you?
No.
Not the interviews? The interviews are quite fun.
Sorry, you mentioned the interviews. Yeah, I really like the interviews. It kind of bums me out people don't listen to them.
I get it, though. People have seen they're going to be a bit more niche or dry, but I think we've selected good people, and a lot of them have re-bought their A-game and had loads of fun anecdotes. And you do a lot more of the heavy lifting on those.
You always prepare them really well and come up with lots of great questions. I just sort of sit there going, huh, yeah, ooh, huh, in the background. There's a big dose of that in last week's Simon Miller episode where I was just like, yep, yep, this is good.
But yeah, I really liked doing that episode with Stu Turton, actually, that was fun.
That was good, that took loads of effort for you.
That was quite a lift. I think that's the only episode of this podcast my dad's listened to, where he was like, oh, that was really good, I really enjoyed that, and I was just like, this whole project has been worth it.
Finally, validation, at last. Yeah, that Stu one's interesting, actually, because that got a few more floating listeners, because a couple of people went on Spotify and talked about how much they loved the episode and loved the books he's written, so he did send some of his listeners our way, which was cool. That was a really good episode.
That was one of the better interview episodes. You just edited the Simon one, what did you make of that? Because I'm not listening back to it yet, but was that good?
Yeah, yeah, it was good. I mean, he's just like a sort of force of nature, and I spent most of it sitting there thinking, oh man, I wish I had this confidence. I think the thing that was interesting about it was, like particularly the period he covered when you were working together, which I don't feel like that story's been like properly or like fully told on the podcast.
I mean, you've told your side of it, but actually he's super energized and very openly proud of it. And it was nice to hear that, you know? It was nice to hear like, oh, we really thought we were the shit, which is not something you would ever really say.
But yeah, I thought it was very sort of endearing to hear you for a very rare occasion where you were like, yeah, that was fucking good, that thing that I did. So that was good.
Yeah, that's the funny thing about that, is that that particular period is, I think probably the only time I would have talked about it was on the best games of 2009, because it was only one year, but it was definitely the most I have had a sense of belonging working on a games media brand. Like it was just, I worked with him, I worked with Lynch, who I stayed with in Japan, so some I'm still friends with to this day. And yeah, a couple of other really good folks as well.
And it was just, yeah, that was like the one time that the whole working on a games magazine thing was exactly like how I imagined it would be when I was reading PC Gamer in 1998. You know what I mean? It was kind of like, Sympatico, get along so well.
It feels like this should last forever. Then they moved me to the fucking sci-fi magazine. So like, it just, yeah, it was nice to unlock.
I think the reason I talked about it so much is it sucks. When it ended, it sucked so much. I was so angry about it.
I was so like, why you, and it felt like they were deliberately breaking up because it was like, because we were clearly enjoying ourselves too much. That's what I always thought about it. I was quite bitter about it for a while.
I just didn't really talk about it. But I think having Simon on really kind of unlocked it. So yeah, that was good.
And then, yeah, I think like the interview episodes do all vary depending on the guest of like, how much they've got. Funny stories they've got. Obviously when guests really understand what the episode's about, that helps a lot.
So, you know, like just plucking a few examples out of thin air. Like when Jen came on, for example, she really got what the podcast is about. And so, you know, you just had so many great anecdotes and observations and stuff.
So, yeah. It's really obvious when someone's listened to the podcast or when they haven't. I mean, I thank them all for their time.
So that doesn't really matter. And like, you know, we invite people on with no expectations, but occasionally you're like, oh yeah, they get it, you know.
Yeah, that's it. And the other thing is, I mean, the two things we've not really done much of on this podcast, you haven't invited NGamer people on really. So we've not talked about that period from another perspective yet.
That's something we should do if we can. And the other thing that we've not done, I've only really just started inviting on Imagine people as well, because I didn't want to just be all the people I knew from, you know, 15 years ago at first. I kind of wanted to build up to it.
So I've had Darren on now and had Simon on. I'm kind of starting to build out that era of games mags on the Bournemouth side a little bit more. It'd be cool to see you do the same with, you know, your learning memories.
Yes, I mean, there are tricky reasons. Everyone's got a very specific reason why they can't do it, which is annoying, but we will eventually get there. It'll probably be tied to certain people being made redundant at some point, unfortunately, but at least it will unlock them as a kick-ass episode.
Well, I appreciate your honesty.
So fingers crossed.
Another personal favourite, honestly, that election special we did, we both messaged each other like, who else is really making this now? But we did, we were like, this is kind of like an old games magazine feeling thing, and there's no reason for people to make that specific kind of like, you know, tone of content these days. So I think we were both quite proud of it.
As a piece of bullshit, I think we thought it was one of our best sort of like silly episodes. You like that one too, right?
Yeah, I like that one too. And I thought the recent, I thought the limited run draft, the special editions, kind of had a bit of that manic energy as well.
It did. We did two. We did like one paywalled one and one free for all one.
They were both like basically built on a foundation of bullshit. So yeah, but I very much enjoyed the best games of different year episodes. Like I love hearing Matthew Teller's home base anecdotes.
I just always enjoy those. So yeah, and we'll do best games of 2004 at some point this year as well. So yeah, those are always good.
But OK, Matthew, moving on to the next question. This is from Serrano. As an adult, what game have you been the most childishly excited about?
Childishly in a good way, that pure innocent excitement, not childish like an Internet man baby. That's just context. No need to read it out.
Oh, I did. Sorry. And if you do read it out, don't read out me asking you not to read it out.
And if you read that out, don't read out that last bit out, et cetera, forever. Oh shit. Yeah, very good.
So what have you got for this one, Matthew?
I mean, it's the same things that I loved when I was reading magazines. Like those games are just ingrained in my head as special things. So I will always be childishly excited for Mario and Zelda.
You know, it was great when I got to do it professionally and be covering those things. And I still maintain that excitement then. But honestly, being out of the Nintendo game a little bit, you know, reading the stuff from afar and getting excited, I mean, that stuff absolutely does it for me.
I mean, I think, you know, the excitement in the lead up to Tears of the Kingdom, I was genuinely watching that stupid trailer with the saxophone music, like, you know, several times every day after it came up. It was just like a real pick-me-up. You know, I think I've mentioned this way back when on the pod, but, like, I remember when Edge gave Mario Odyssey a 10 and, like, reading that review and just some of the details jumping out, you know, like, I remember the review specifically mentioning, like, the HD rumble kind of, you jump into the carbonated sea and feel like the fizz in the controller and, you know, that was just like being, you know, 14 again and reading N64 and being like, holy shit, I just, this is the most exciting thing ever.
The countdown has begun. So, yeah, that still does it for me. Like, Nintendo, the Nintendo biggies at the top of their game, that's probably the ones.
What about you?
Yeah, so I've definitely mentioned these before, but while I was working in Games to Media, because I came into Games to Media having seen these games already be announced, I was like, I just can't wait to find out what the story is. Specifically with Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots and Final Fantasy XIII, they were the things where they were both announced in like 05, 06 kind of time. And then I came in being like, oh, I can't fucking wait for these things.
And then they were both slightly disappointing, but that's fine. But to be honest, like I don't... Nintendo, I don't know if I necessarily have the same connection to it that you do, but I definitely get excited about their stuff.
I just pre-ordered that Zelda game with the tables yesterday, so I'm looking forward to that. Pre-ordered Metaphor, what's it called as well. That's in the hopper.
I'm really looking forward to... I still get this excited about Star Wars games as well. I'm not even remotely dubious about Outlaws, for example, which I think got some mixed headlines across the Summer Games Fest period.
People are like, oh, it's a bit like Uncharted. I was like, that sounds like the best thing in the world. How is that a bad thing?
Fucking love Uncharted. This actually made me think again about my Division 2 take about how no one makes third-person cover shooters anymore. If someone makes a good one, that's rad to me.
I'm well into that. If there's some good third-person shooter missions in there, I'll be well up for that. I'm pretty open-minded because I like all Star Wars games, even the ones that aren't very good, as established on this podcast.
That still happens. But Final Fantasy, I suppose, is probably the main one. Any time a game comes along in that series, I never really saw them as work when I was in games media.
I was like, oh, no, that one's for me. That's a series that's special to me, and I still see it that way. 16 was definitely that, and I still haven't properly cracked 7 Rebirth by Will at some point, and any time they're doing something cool with that series, like remastering an old one, I'm into it.
So yeah, I think that answers that one, Matthew. Do you want to read out this next one?
Hello, chaps. I've been re-listening to the Ace Attorney pod this week, and I'm about to play Apollo Justice for the first time. Given Matthew's gone on the record as not liking Iris and Pearl Fey, which I don't disagree with personally, it got me wondering who he considers to be the best and worst hangs from across the series.
That's from Synthetic Man. It was funny, as I was listing these out, I realised there's way more bad hangs than good hangs in Ace Attorney.
Oh yeah, definitely.
But then that's the whole nature of the game, is about bringing down people who are brazenly shitbags, and that's part of the pleasure, so they need to be shitbags to begin with. And lots of annoying people kind of obscuring the truth, and getting in your way, and being obstacles and whatnot. So just by its nature, there has to be a lot of friction.
So, I mean, there's loads of bad hangs. Off the top of my head, Yanny Yogi, that kind of homeless guy with the parrot. He sucks.
Francesca von Karma, she's annoying, her whip animation. Wendy Oldbag.
Oh, definitely, all-timer.
Kind of funny, but bad hang. Oh, I've forgotten his name. Who's that?
Oh, Salmonella, that sleazy film director. Him appearing alongside Wendy Oldbag in that third case is a real double whammy in the first game. Most of the new characters in Ace Attorney Investigations are pretty shit.
Xilong Lang, the kind of Interpol prosecutor. Fucking Interpol shouldn't be in this game. That's a weird thing.
That's a weirdly specific thing to turn up in Ace Attorney game. Yeah, and he's just like... I just don't really get what the joke is with him.
Also, the prosecutor from the second Ace Attorney Investigations game, whose name might be Mark Smith, but we can't remember. I think it was something to best, and it's Eustace Winner. Anyway, whatever.
A lot of people are about to discover he's a mega bad hang. Really slows it down. If you cut him out, you'd cut like five hours from that game, then it would be much better.
Good hangs. I think Godot is quite cool. I quite like Emma Skye, the kind of forensics detective, I guess, forensic specialist.
She's the one who's always eating the snack crisps. She's in... Which is the first one she's in?
She's definitely in Apollo Justice. Yeah, that's who I got for good hangs.
I mean, that's a pretty great comprehensive list. I feel like this question got more effort than all the other ones in this whole episode, which is fine.
But, you know, it's very you. I'd say most of them are bad. I'm not even sure if Phoenix Wright's a particularly good hang.
Oh, I don't know. He's all right. Like, I like being in his shoes.
I'm like, you know what I mean? You're just a level head.
Like, he's not really anything. He's quite a, like, vanilla presence.
Yeah. Well, I'm a mere Fey-Tree-3, as you know. I'd much rather spend time with Mia than Maya.
That's my whole thing with that series. But again, not a horny podcast. That's purely based on personality.
Yeah, so, yeah, that's good, Matthew. I've got nothing to add there because you are the authority on Ace of Turning, so all good. Let's move on to the next question, shall we?
This is from Effie. What do your backlogs look like? Do you keep track of a backlog of games or just go with the flow?
What stuff have you missed that you'd most like to give a go? Well, if you're a subscriber to the Patreon, you are seeing some of the games that we'd like to give a go that we've missed because they are the ones that are mostly populating the poll we've been doing for the Two Giant Men play episodes. So that's one thing.
Matthew, you have played every computer game. You keep on top of them extremely well. Every time I go to play something, you've already finished it.
So how do you keep on top of your backlog?
With me, if I don't get through it in that first run, it's probably going to slip through the cracks and I'll never return to it. So it's kind of all or nothing in that first run, which is why I get through so many games. But there are some things that have not quite made it off the top of my head.
I'm trying to think of any biggies from this year that I've yet to have started and not finished.
The Sona 3 Reload, that's one you've not done, is it?
Yeah, but I played about five hours of it and stopped for... I don't know why. Actually, I do know why.
It's because I couldn't work out... It felt like it wouldn't trigger the next story beat, because obviously it has that time structure where you've got X amount of time to kind of climb up this tower. And it wouldn't let me proceed any higher until something had happened in the story, but I'd obviously rinsed it in a couple of days.
So I was just going through this... You sometimes get that in Persona, like killing time routine, where you're doing all the social links and all this stuff, but you've not really got a dungeon to go and express all this new power in. That's my only problem with the Persona game's structure as it is.
So that's why I stalled on that. I have got a massive backlog. I'm on my Steam library.
The amount of shit I've bought on there and never played. Pretty more indie stuff, to be honest, because I feel like I've had to have, you know, professional opinions on bigger kind of AAA retail stuff. And, you know, that's the stuff which, you know, I tend to work with.
So there's lots of, like, you know, worthy things that I've played, like, half an hour of and then noped out of.
Yeah, that makes sense. How did you... did you stick with Sifu in the end, by the way?
I didn't.
Yeah, it's quite hard going, isn't it?
Like, it's difficult-wise. I just felt like I... For about half an hour in, I thought I really had it.
Like, I had the basics of it. And then when I tried to layer anything extra into the basics, it just came apart really quickly. And it's a very, like...
It spirals out of control quite quickly, that game, when you're doing badly. And that was an experience that kind of bummed me out a bit.
Yeah, it's definitely quite extreme, the difficulty curve. The first mission is very much to ease you into it. It's never that easy again kind of thing.
And then the nightclub, there's so much that can go wrong in that nightclub. It's just so many encounters, like big dudes who fuck you up. And then the boss is an absolute pain in the dick as well.
I really liked it, but it was very much... It was like repeating the Sekiro power curve a little bit, and just fighting my way to the end, basically. And then being like bloodily triumphant, so I kind of get that.
As for me, my backlog is quite extensive as well. This podcast has been good for sort of... I do definitely try and keep on top of contemporary games more with this podcast.
It used to be a bit more of a, I'll replay the things that I find comfortable kind of person. But now I'm a bit like, oh no, it's good to keep on top of the stuff, have fresh takes, make the podcast kind of feel like it's got new things to say. So I've actually really enjoyed that part of it.
It's given me a bit more structure to the way I clear out games for my backlog and look ahead and that sort of thing. I am on backlogged as well. I did start that to try and keep track of things that I've kind of started and half finished and things like that.
So there's like 20 games in my currently playing thing, and it's got everything in there from like, Jeusaint, which I am playing at the moment, to like Marvel's Midnight Suns, which I haven't played since February, but I will go back till my week off next week and try and finish that 95-hour campaign. So yeah, and then there's about 80 different word documents I've got that have got like games to complete, and then both Horizon games are in there, Red Dead Redemption 2, you know, Returnal, a bunch of stuff basically. So yeah, I don't know if I'll get through it all, but we've entered a bit of a low-key quiet window in games at the very moment, so there's a bit of time to clear stuff off.
That's why I'm playing Jeusaint, a game from last year, which I wouldn't normally do.
I love that you've become this big Jeusaint guy.
It's really good. Have you played it?
I played a couple of hours of it. That's lost now to the backlog.
Yeah, I get you, but it's a really good version of what it is, which is that premium indie four-hour story with one or two key mechanics kind of thing.
I wish it didn't have collectibles.
Yeah, but you don't have to bother with those.
No, you don't have to, but my stupid brain is like, I must, and that's where the game's at this week. I think if it was just like, just get up this thing and don't worry about that. And I know that you can play it like that.
That's what I get hung up on. I'm like, oh, I've had too many frustrating bits. I'm like, ooh, is there a thing down on that weird ledge?
And then I fucking die a billion times and you're not even meant to go down there.
Yeah, I'm quite good at fighting that instinct. It's just off that crop of indie games where it's like, was this green lit at a time where it felt like there was massive money bags in the industry before all the dark carnage happened?
The dark carnage.
I feel that way about Steel Wakes The Deep as well. It's that kind of thing of when this was green lit and the money you spent on it, as in the money is on the screen, you feel the investment in it. Was it like, oh, the sky is the limit with how much this will sell?
Because with Juuson specifically, on the Wikipedia page at least, it says, oh, it missed its sales targets and the team was disbanded. And you're like, that fucking sucks as an outcome for this game because it's a really good version of what it is. But anyway, yeah.
So yeah, I can't remember what my point was there. But yeah, I tried my best to keep on top of my backlog, but it's true that things, there's an ever-moving forward momentum to things. The other thing I'm going to do next week as well, I'm going to try playing Obra Dinn for the first time properly on my Switch because not done that.
That and Outer Wilds feel like the two main things I've not really ticked off in recent years that I know I will love. So it would be good to have done those for sure.
Outer Wilds has got big, you're going to bounce off the spaceship controls and be one of those people and that's going to be sad for me. But I will respect it.
Do you know that I'm one of the people who played the GDC build back in the day?
In which case you might not.
No, I liked all that, but I thought the roughness was kind of part of the charm of it. It was like the fact that you can go from one place to another, there is stuff out there to find. That was part of the very core appeal of it to me.
The space mystery, cosmic mystery stuff is secondary. I do just like how tangible the space travel feels in that game. That's not an obstacle.
It's how long it is. When I read it, it's like 20 hours plus. How is that fucking possible?
It's such a tiny little set of worlds you've got. But I'll come back to that, Matthew, at some point. Okay, next question.
Do you want to read this one out?
Yes. As per most recent pod, which isn't true anymore because this was from ages ago, here's an emergency cheese draft. Three only, one for each category.
One, cheese that melts. Two, cheese you eat cold. Three, free pick.
Regular rules apply. Enjoy. That's from Welsh boy Nick.
Again?
Yep. Sorry, I let two questions through for the same list. I'm not supposed to do that.
Okay, so who goes first, Matthew? Should we do the coin flip? I can do the coin flip.
Okay, heads or tails?
Heads.
Heads. Wids.
The first draft of coin toss I've won, and it's a fucking imaginary cheese draft. Oh, God. Sam, I don't really know much about cheese.
Cheese that melts.
You fucking loved it. Okay, I mean, is that what you're going with first?
I don't love cheese.
Oh, don't you? I thought you were a cheese guy. Okay, maybe not.
All right, well, you've got to go first.
Cheese that melts. I mean, they all melt, don't they? You apply enough heat to them.
Yeah, some of them melt a bit plasticky and like add my melting vinyl right now kind of thing. I think there's a really obvious answer for this one personally, but you know.
Oh, okay. Well, uh...
It's going to turn into the red faction of cheese drafts. How is this even possible?
I'm trying to think of, like, toasted cheese. I mean, the thing is, like, the cheese I have most heated up is probably, like, whatever, you know, pizza cheese, you know, whatever that is.
Mozzarella.
Mozzarella, that's right.
That's a classic. I like that.
Yeah, but it's a bit... Yeah, all right. Mozzarella.
That's fine. Okay, mozzarella, category one, cheese that melts, Matthew's picked mozzarella. I'm going to take camembert for cheese that melts, category one.
Oh, that is strong. Fuck.
Yeah, like, you put little garlic cloves in it.
I do like the deep crisps in it and stuff.
Exactly. Or cucumber.
Oh, that's god. It's like the only cheese which is like its own fondue pot.
That's the Metroid Prime trilogy of cheese draft picks. So, yeah.
I mean, I've absolutely fucked it. I wouldn't really base it, bitch, mozzarella on this.
Mozzarella is a classic, though. You need it on every single pizza. It's a good pick.
So, what's your second pick?
Cheese you eat cold, which I would say is all cheese. Gouda? Is that a cheese?
Gouda.
Is that how it's pronounced? I don't even know how it's pronounced. That's how little I know about cheese.
Yeah, that seems alright.
Isn't that quite hard and not one you'd eat on a sandwich? Is that Gouda? A little bit harder?
Yeah, but you can still cut it and eat it. I've not eaten it. Why are you arguing that's a cheese that melts?
No, no, no. I actually don't know what the best use of Gouda is. I think that's fine, actually.
So, yeah, that's fine.
Well, I like it. Basically, it's mild. I don't like anything strong.
Fair enough. Okay, so I'm going to take my beloved Porceloo for Cheesy Week Cold. I just...
It's kind of like got a slightly dairy-ish texture, and they've definitely jacked the price up way past where it should be for fucking Cozzy Lives. They're like welling on the Cozzy Lives grift with Heinz and their baked beans, but like it's a great cheese, I can't deny. Porceloo, always like a great base cheese when you're having cold cheese.
What's your free pick, Matthew?
My free pick is I really like processed cheese slices that you have for hamburgers.
I think that will win it for you, to be honest. That's like the people's cheese.
I'll eat those things as a snack, you know? It's like a nice contained piece of cheese with its own wrapping.
Okay, good. All right, I will take cheddar for the last pick. It's a classic, so I'm very versatile.
Matthew's got mozzarella. I need like a versatile cheese to like balance it out.
I don't think I've heard of your second one.
Porceloo. I don't think it's like a type of cheese. It's like just a brand of cheese.
Oh, like a laughing cow.
Yeah, but like, you know, nicer than that. It's got like the orange sort of like waxy thing on the outside.
I don't look, I just don't look at the cheese aisle.
I think the cheese heads out there will be with me. Porceloo is a banger.
Well, yeah, listen, I'm not, I'm fully expecting and willing to lose this one.
Well, that's not going out as like a fucking poll in the Discord. We're not doing that. So and no one at me saying, can you please post some results of the cheese draft so I can know who to vote for?
It's not a real draft, so it's fine. Okay, do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
Hi, Samuel Matthew, just a quick one. Musical episodes in American TV shows, yay or nay? Personally, I think that they should be banished from existence, especially in prestige dramas like Mad Men.
Cheers, that's from Angry Kurt. Did Mad Men have a musical episode?
I think he's referring to when, spoiler alert, for Mad Men. If you've not watched it, you should, because it's fucking great. When Burt Cooper dies and he sings in like Don Draper imagines it in The Office.
That's a great scene.
Yeah, it's one scene. It's done really well. Isn't he like a musical theatre actor, as well as he was an actor?
Oh, that rings a bell.
Yeah, so I don't have a problem with that. There's also the scene where Ken Crossgrove dances with one eye. That was quite good.
My feeling on this though, I kind of agree in the sense that episodes are wholly like, we're doing the musical episode now. A bit of diminishing returns ever since that Buffy episode, which is a really good episode of Buffy, like really well put together. The music's by like some, I think that's like a Broadway, like composer worked on it or something like that.
So it's a very, very strong episode. They've all gotten slightly worse as they've gone, so didn't like the Scrubs one. The Community one's pretty good, the Christmas Glee episode one.
But generally speaking, it's not like a draw for me anymore. It feels very old TV to be like, we're doing a musical episode now.
Not into Strange New World, Dr. Mbenga doing a song and dance number?
I fucking hated that episode. That's the only episode of Strange New World I genuinely didn't like. So many people online were like, oh, if you hate this, you're the enemy of fun.
Well, I'm the enemy of fun then, but this is not good. This is not good, people. I was as furious as Mbenga was at singing it.
Oh, Mbenga's my guy. What do you think, Matthew?
So I don't like them. I really like musicals, and I'm a bit of a snob about it, to be honest. So I don't like them.
I often think the songs are just shit. I think getting a musical right takes fucking ages and genuine genius. And I know that they bus in actual musical writers to write these, but they kind of bang them out on a TV schedule and they're always only fine.
I would extend that to a lot of new musicals, which are films. One of my least popular takes is that I do not like the music in La La Land.
Alright.
For the same reason. As someone who goes to the theatre a lot, if I saw that in there, it would be incredibly mid as a musical.
What about In The Heights, Matthew?
In The Heights, yeah, I didn't mind it. That was written for the stage. That was decent.
That was a nice pandemic era watch. I enjoyed that.
Yeah. Lots of people dancing incredibly close to each other and sweating on each other, which coming out of COVID, you were like, oh yeah, that seems alright.
Yeah, I remember that.
I remember this. I remember those hot summer nights in The Heights where I used to sweat on my neighbours. Yeah.
So yeah, I do not like them, but I also don't think the Mad Men one is one. So sorry, Kurt.
Yeah, it doesn't count, Kurt. It's not like the Breaking Bad did one, do you know what I mean? Although that would have been quite a pivot for season five.
Okay, good. I think we've answered that one comprehensively. What's your favourite car in games?
This is from Blinky. Blinky, you have many questions, but I won't answer loads and loads of questions from the same lister. So my advice is, even though your questions are quite good...
Unless it's Welsh boy Nick.
True, yeah. Welsh boy Nick. Space them out a little bit more so they don't all get kind of ignored.
That's my only advice to you, Blinky. So I think the happiest car has ever made me in a game. I think the number one great example, if you have to admire the animation, the vision behind it, is the Batmobile in Arkham Knight.
That's an incredible looking thing. It smashes through concrete. I think they said it takes up so much memory or something like that.
It was a real feat of programming. It's a really nice thing, even though the tank combat bits were contentious. I think that's a great feeling.
Complete the Batman fantasy, getting a Batmobile kind of thing. That was cool. But the happiest the car has ever made me, I think, is whenever you steal that Banshee in GTA III that's in the car dealership, like it's behind glass, so you have to shoot through it with an easier handgun or something, go in there and you just drive through the window and steal it.
It's so much faster than every fucking car that you find on the first island of that game. That always just stands out to me as like a standout car experience in a game. But what do you think, Matthew?
Both excellent cars. Batmobile, I particularly agree with you. I picked the Volkswagen New Beetle as seen in Beetle Adventure Racing.
Like a fun little car to put around within that game and it was just loads of Beetles racing, so you didn't have to think about or know anything about cars, so that was a big tick. Another one which really jumped out for me, just because it fed into the ridiculousness of this particular series, was when they did the Halo Warthog in Forza Horizon 3. You could just bomb around Australia in that thing, and I think if you listen to the Classical Music Channel, it had a few Halo tracks on there, and occasionally you're doing a cross-country race and the Halo theme starts playing and you're in that car, and that game's pretty arcadey and poppy and fun, and whatever car you pick, you're going to have a pretty good time, but with someone who has such little interesting cars, just giving me that kind of, if you pick this car, you're going to have to know nothing about cars.
It's just a made-up video game car. That was perfect for me.
Yeah, good choices, Matthew. I think we answered that pretty well. I'm so surprised.
It is surprising when you get a game question and then we have just really solid game answers, and then it's back to, let's do five minutes of a cheese draught.
Exactly. Do you want to read out this next one, Matthew?
Yes. Have you two medium men ever enjoyed or disliked a game much more than you expected? Xenoblade has always been disappointing to me.
I bought it when it came out for the Wii and it never clicked for me, ending up as a trade-in a few years later. After Matthew's glowing praise of Xenoblade 3, I picked it up and played through the entirety of it, waiting for the moment where its brulence truly shone through. But alas, it again never worked for me.
It's so frustrating because I want to love it so badly. In contrast, I got given Pikmin 4 as a gift and assumed that I wasn't going to enjoy it, but I have absolutely adored it. That's from Pip.
Good.
Always nice to know that I disappointed someone with one of my verdicts, so thank you for that.
And they played through every single bit of it as well. They were like, Nope, I don't get this after 80 hours.
It's like 100 hours. If you play 100 hours or something, you're like, No, no, maybe the last hour of it will click into place. Like, come on.
That's on you. That's on you, dog.
That's got big. I only own a Nintendo Switch energy. So I'll just play all the games that are on this very comprehensively.
OK, so disliked. The one that I just always remember is, I just couldn't believe how much I didn't like it after loving the original was definitely Final Fantasy X-2 because I paid full price for it. I pre-ordered it.
I got my mum to order it on fucking Amazon. I just gave her the money for my paper round. I was like, get me this.
This is like the number one cultural event of my teenage life. And then just it was pop music and I thought not a very good combat system. It was just not kind of my sort of thing.
It felt very inconsequential after X, which takes itself quite seriously. The old Macarena reference aside. More recently, I guess, and I definitely don't say as to bait, but the fact that I didn't love Tears of the Kingdom Out of the Gate was a little bit of a like, I thought I would and then didn't.
And so that was kind of my experience of that game of massive expecting to like it exactly as much as I like Breath of the Wild and then it being a more challenging work to get my head around. Dislike is probably not quite the right word. It just wasn't quite the sort of thing I wanted from it, but that's okay.
I guess I dislike the sign guy. That's fine. But I'm not going to go into that again.
Games I'm surprised I liked. I mean, I guess Sekiro ticks this box a little bit. This happens every now and then with like, I'll play like a side-scrolling shooter out of nowhere.
So when I talked about, so like Einhander, for example, is a game that surprised me where I was like, well, this genre, I can sort of take or leave it if it's too hard. And Einhander is quite hard. But Einhander was like the one where I was like, I'm surprised by how much I enjoy this.
PS1 side-scrolling shooter. There's a few games like that I've given a go in recent weeks after making various episodes of this podcast, like G Darius or like, I've talked about it before, but like R-Type Delta on PS1, where I feel like these are not my homeland sort of genres. They're more sort of like retro hardcore genres, but they'll sort of surprise me and I'll be quite into them.
What about you, Matthew?
Yeah, one from like many years ago that I remember being like a first huge disappointment was Monkey Island 4, which escaped from Monkey Island, I think that one's called. The 3D one basically made it with the sort of, I guess the Grim Fandango kind of engine. And it was just, you know, one, two and three, I think are kind of pretty much, you know, sort of part of par with each other.
But this one was, I just found that all the jokes were really, just didn't click with me at all. There was so many jokes about fucking coffee shops and like local elections. It was, it had a really, like whoever had written it had just taken it in a really fucked up direction.
And I remember just thinking this isn't funny and the puzzles aren't good enough. That was like a huge disappointment. I guess this doesn't quite count because, you know, I still fundamentally reviewed it really well.
But I remember when Smash Brothers Brawl came out, I thought the single player suite of stuff in that game was just so weak. I've talked about it before how much I hate the subspace chemistry, but that was like, oh man, I couldn't believe that something that stinky was in something that good. But I'm not sure that entirely counts.
In terms of things that I've enjoyed, I mean, my enthusiasm for Forza Horizon is purely because it's the first, like, racing game, you know, in a quote-unquote realistic racing game, that's really clicked with me. You know, I just, yeah, I love the mix of the open world and then the focus of the races themselves. I think that's great.
The fact that it scales, like, how interested you are in it being, you know, simmy at all. You can just cut all that out and just bum around in all the racing aids. And I know that there are lots of other games which made like big strides in that area, like with the racing lines on the track and all that kind of stuff.
But yeah, Forza Horizon was one where that is just not traditionally my game, but I absolutely loved it.
That's a good one.
Yeah, those are probably like biggies. I mean, since doing this job, I've kind of, I don't know, you approach everything, but you try and approach everything as best you can with like a, you know, not one way or another really. You don't want to kind of color it too much or like review to your expectations.
He said after talking about at length, but how much he loses his shit for Mario and Zelda still. So it goes.
Well, dislike isn't the right word, but like God of War Ragnarok was one where it didn't quite meet my expectations after really loving that 2018 God of War game. You know, it was just, even though there was clearly more money spent on it, like the net gain wasn't really there. It was like the end product somehow, despite having higher production values, wasn't better.
That was kind of a weird one, but I always wondered if I was an outlier on that one because it got it reviewed so, so well, but it just wasn't after playing all those God of War games in a row, it just felt so soft by comparison. Yeah, I don't know. But then we've talked about how we're sort of like God of War 3 pills on this podcast before.
How it's among our more problematic takes.
It's only problematic until we manage to lure Stig Asmussen onto this podcast.
Again, if you know Stig Asmussen and can help us get him on the podcast, we'd fucking love to speak to him. So it's no longer Works 3A, it'd be perfect time for it. So yeah, that's an ambition of ours.
Okay, Matthew, should we do like a couple more? What do you reckon?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. This next one then, just Kai. If licensed tie-in games were still a thing, what modern TV show slash film would you like to see get the seven out of 10 license game treatment?
Slow Horses Point and Click maybe, or how about a Mad Men gacha game? Keep up the quality episodes, lads. Succession Beat'em Up, Matthew, obviously.
Like Venba, but it's The Bear.
Who's your main in a Succession Beat'em Up?
I think what's Kieran Culkin, because he'll have smaller hit boxes, so it'd be harder to hit. I think he'd be good for that. What about you?
What would be your main? Tom-Worms-Gams?
Yeah, I've got big Tom-Worms-Gangs energy.
Okay, so that aside, I thought about Venba, but it's The Bear, and you're basically endlessly trying to tweak the same meal, while fighting off Joel McHale calling you a piece of shit in the background.
That is so different. Venba is such a loving, respectful game. I love the idea of taking that, just making it fucking evil and toxic.
What about you, Matthew?
That's great. I didn't get much further, then. I wrote, line of duty, questioning people in that room with a bad Ted Hastings sound-alike would be good.
I'm not entirely sure what kind of game it is. Maybe it's a Sanbarlo-esque thing. Though that's an interrogation room, it's not an interrogation game.
I guess it would just be a very complicated piece of interactive fiction, but I really like the confrontations where they're just throwing in loads of evidence. I guess it's Ace Attorney, except it's trying to get rid of bent coppers. That's good.
A bit more Ellie D'Oreal vibe to it, then, maybe?
Yeah, maybe. But I'd be into it. I would think, actually, you'd be able to stretch to getting like Adrian Dunbar.
I think his name is... Is Adrian Dunbar? To be the voice of it.
And if you can't, yeah. Yeah. No, that'd be good.
I keep seeing ads for him in Kiss Me Kate when I'm ever walking to the chicken shop in London, so I'm pretty sure we could get him for that game if we needed to.
Yeah. I read some funny reviews of that saying he's not like the best singer in the world. I think he is the best singer in the...
He's very confident. I think he's a bit of a crooner, you know?
Right. Big Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia energy.
I wouldn't say it's that bad. I mean, that was tough.
Yeah, that was. You know what? They went for it.
I think he thought he was a crooner, Brosnan in that.
What's funny about that film is the three of them, him, Stellan Skarsgård and the other one...
Colin Firth.
Colin Firth. It's that you can see them physically bracing themselves for the musical numbers. They're like, oh, this is going to be rough.
It's really, really endearing. You can see in their eyes that this is not good and I'm not good in this.
Yeah, definitely with Brosnan as well. He's like, I'm giving it everything I can, but I know it's not quite their sort of energy. Did you see the second one?
I didn't, no, no.
They're making a third one, I think, as well. Fair enough, make that dollar. But yeah, dubious at best.
That's a film that my mum forced me to watch. She punished me with that after I tried to get her to play Beatles' rock band and she didn't understand it. She was like, right, it recompensed.
You will watch this horror show of a film.
We've done something you love, so now we're going to do something I love.
Yeah, basically. That's exactly what happened. Last one I was going to throw in was, I did think a bit about Slow Horses, because not many TV shows these days feel like they're well-made for this sort of thing.
So you could do a beat-em-up of The Boys, but I don't think it would be good, you know, Carl Urban getting beaten up by Anthony Starr or whatever. I'm not sure that really works. So I thought about Slow Horses.
I like the idea of trying to adapt every season of Slow Horses as a GoldenEye slash Perfect Dark N64 era FPS. So you go and meet Freddie Fox on the bridge, and then he's shot, but his face is completely static and all the text is just above in large font, and it's in 240p or whatever. That sort of thing appeals.
And then at the end, set piece from season three of Slow Horses, they're in that vault thing, that Liby place, and they're having a shootout. That might work quite well. But TV shows, you and I have both just watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
I'm not sure you can make a TV show of that, for example. Has that era just faded, Matthew, of things being easy to adapt in that quite cheap fashion?
Oh, I think so, especially when there's real... you know, the expectations of delivering the lightness of those actors. And if it looks dodgy, people are...
you know, you get absolutely kind of hounded. I mean, I keep thinking of poor old Alone in the Dark and then now Deceased Studio behind it. Because they had...
you know, their big thing was like, it's got David Harbour and Jodie Comer and... you know, not a TV adaptation, but was trading on, like, their TV kind of star power, I guess. But, like, they just couldn't quite...
you know, they weren't... you know, they were like character models from maybe a couple of generations ago, you know? They didn't look like...
they looked like kind of dead-eyed wax mannequins of David Harbour and Jodie Comer. And I just feel like the second you have a real person in the mix, you just... you really have to deliver on that, or it just instantly looks so kind of ropey.
So it's probably why people don't make these things. Though I think, like, every once in a while you hear that a show has a, like, a secretly, like, low-key, excellent mobile phone tie-in.
Like what?
Well, like, there was one... wasn't there one for, like, Mr. Robot?
Oh, yeah, it was, like, an app where I think it would call you and stuff, and it was, like... it was tying into the fiction of the show because it was all about conspiracies and corporations.
Yeah, like, every once in a while there is some... I mean, maybe that is the example I'm thinking of. But did you see that thing going around the fake bear game?
I did watch it because it was five minutes, and I think that's too long for any joke, which I know is very rich coming from this podcast, but still, was it good?
Uh, yeah, it was all right.
Yeah, I remember when, like, Game of Thrones, they did, like, a fake one for that, and it was, like... it was an RPG, basically, and it had the theme tune and stuff. And, yeah, it's sort of like...
I still get exactly what JustiKai is hinting at here, which is, like, when there would be, like, X-Files, Resist or Serve on PS2 or whatever, you know, that kind of thing. It's just... It's true that that's gone.
Or, like, The Simpsons Hit and Run or The Simpsons Road Rage. So it is a bit of a lost kind of thing, yeah.
I can't remember who it was. Maybe it was Curve. A British studio did, like, Peaky Blinders.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And it was, like, a weird, like, turn-based... I think it had a turn-based element. It was almost like a sort of stealth X-Com, I think, in that you had, like, a certain number of moves and, like, different characters with different powers and, like, you know, they would...
They could slow down time, and it was like, you know, Peaky Blinders time to show how fast... Yeah, to show how fast Tommy Blinders or whatever his name is thinks that he can, like, slow down time.
He just smashes a packet of pork scratchings and then time slows down. And it's like Red Dead Redemption with the... What's it?
The tobacco or whatever.
Yeah, he's just got like, it's fine. I've got like 50 packets of pork scratchings. I just fucking nick them.
Oh, OK, good. We've got one last question to see us out here, Matthew. So Blinky did get a second question, actually.
So Smell-O-Vision has been invented. Which game worlds would you visit and which would you steer clear of? What have you got, Matthew?
Well, I'm obviously visiting Sweet Sweet Galaxy from Merit Galaxy, which is the one with big trays of biscuits with holes in them. I mean, in the game, it's a conveyor belt of death and you fall through the holes, you fall into the abyss. But as long as I don't have to do the level, if I can just stand in the gateway platform and just smell it, that's fine.
I don't want to die in a biscuit factory, is what I'm saying. I've often thought Tucson, in the Witcher Blood and Wine DLC, would smell nice. It's this fairy tale kingdom, it's almost like a send-up of the Disneyland kind of thing, with the big castle and everything's got crazy colours that pop, and there's lots of vineyards everywhere.
That place looks like it would smell nice compared to the rest of the Witcher, which looks like it would smell of human shit and blood and piss, which would be horrible. I was playing Portal 2 the other day, and it crossed my mind that I bet the gels probably smell good. I like fresh paint.
That's a good one. I like that. That's nicely considered.
I guess I only thought about food. Some think of that Simpsons game level where you go to the Land of Chocolate, for example, but the chocolate by itself doesn't really smell, does it?
Well, you go to York and it's in the air.
That's true. It'd probably be a smell of fudge or hot toffee or something. I'd avoid the Fallout Capital wasteland.
I'd avoid the kitchen that's in Little Nightmares. That's got very cursed, bad energy. There's a lot of awful-looking food in that game, for example.
So those come to mind as bad smells. Silent Hill, I can't imagine that smelling nice either. What about you, Matthew?
I think a lot of Inside would smell bad.
Oh, definitely. Like that fleshy monster thing at the end.
That thing definitely smells rank, but just those cavernous halls where there's meat clones running around. That's going to be musty and eerie. Wouldn't be into that.
Any game set in a war zone, I think that'll smell pretty bleak.
I do like the smell of very crisp cold, but you are going to soon fire up the engines of industry. If you, as the mayor of Frostpunk Town, get steamed to death by the angry masses at the end of the campaign, as happened to me, that would smell rank. I've got to play that game at some point.
I don't want to smell a broiled mare.
I bet Crash Bandicoot smells terrible. That's another thing. I bet that's not a good scent.
It's like a dog. Yeah, basically.
Unwashed. I know he wears trousers, but I don't think he showers.
I'll tell you what, a breath of the wild. When you're standing in one of those fields and just the wind gusts through, I bet that smells fresh.
What do you think the depths smell like, though, in Tears of the Kingdom?
Oh, bad.
Yeah, bad stench down there.
You wouldn't want to live near one of the depth holes.
No, maybe that's like the peripheral they're going to include with the Switch 2 to sort of differentiate it from the Switch 1, is smellovision. And the game that debuts it will be like, oh, smell this lovely field in Breath of the Wild, then go underground in Tears of the Kingdom and it smells awful. And people will be like, fuck, Nintendo's done it again, man.
And that will be the narrative of the Switch 2. Okay, Matthew, I think we've ticked that off comprehensively. Anything more to add on smells, or should we wrap up the episode?
Anything more to add on smells.
I think an hour and 26 minutes is enough of a rail bag, isn't it? I think people have had their fill.
I've had my fill.
Excellent. You have to have dinner now, so that's important. Thank you so much for listening.
And if you want to send questions to the podcast, you can email us at backpagegames.gmail.com. You can also jump into the Discord. There is a pod questions hashtag channel in there.
That's where I get most of the questions from. So, anyway, you want to send questions, we'll try and get to them eventually.
Especially if you're Stig Atmoson.
Yeah, exactly. I do try and curate them a little bit, but we try and tick off as many as we can. So, thank you.
And the next podcast, is the next podcast the first of our Nintendo ones, Matthew? I think it might be.
God, we're quite far ahead now, so...
Yeah, we're recording these slightly earlier than we normally do. So, yes, we've got... Yeah, it is.
So, the next... What we're doing then is... This has changed a little bit since I first mentioned it.
We're doing a three-parter Nintendo Top 50. So, we're going to do one episode that's more in the vein of, like, discussing how magazines get made, which is the art of list-making. We're going to talk about that and the original list they did in the official Nintendo magazine when Matthew was running it of the Top 50 Nintendo games.
And you did a second list on the Top 50 third-party games. Is that right, Matthew?
I think it may actually be two Top 100s.
Top 100s? Fuck it. Really?
You did 200 games?
Yeah.
Wow. Okay, okay. Well, I've got...
But then there's just, like, the death of Nintendo magazines in the UK, so we thought we should go out. Yeah.
Oh, shit. Maybe it has to be a Top 100 then. I'll give that some thought.
We can discuss that off-air.
And then there's a second episode where we're going to be, like, compiling the long list and setting the rules of what goes in, how many from each series, et cetera, and, like, just sort of, like... I think, like, narrowing it down to, like, a pool of games, basically. And then a final list episode, which will come after that.
There'll all be all three episodes in a row, but they'll all be quite different from each other and, hopefully, quite enjoyable. Bit of a different project for us. We thought we might mix things up, so maybe Matthew's dreading it.
I don't know. How are you feeling about it, Matthew?
Yeah, I'm feeling good. Feels like quite a lift. I'm worried about the actual, like, doing...
like, talking through a list and it not being, like, a thousand hours long.
Yeah, I guess that's... I think, like... We'll find ways to circumnavigate that, where I think we have, like, a cap on how much we discuss the games in, like, the bottom 30 or something like that.
That's why I'm, like, very nervous about it being a hundred.
Yeah, a hundred does seem like too many, doesn't it? Fifty's fine. Fifty's a good enough project for us, so we'll stick to that.
But we will talk about the original list, because I think it'll be fun, it'll inform what comes next. There's also an XXL episode on the best TV shows and films we've been watching this year so far, so that's coming on the 29th of July, I think it is. So, yep, that should be...
You don't have to watch eight films to listen to that one. You just have to tune in. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it.
And, yep, the podcast can be followed at BackpagePod on Twitter, patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on all social media platforms.
Matthew, what about you?
I'm MrBazzill underscore pesto on Twitter and MrBazzill pesto no underscore on Blue Sky.
Wonderful. Thank you so much for listening and goodbye.
