Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Lower your expectations, it's a mailbag episode. Recorded on a Monday evening, no less. Tough, always tough doing podcasts on a Monday evening.
They're always a bit more challenging for whatever reason to get into like the jolly head space. And so your best hope is that somehow it sort of tips over into cursed and accidentally reverses into becoming funny. Yeah, we'll see how that goes, Matthew.
How are you doing? You all right? Did you have a nice weekend in the end?
I feel like I didn't chat too much on Sunday. Did you get up to anything exciting?
Oh, what on earth did I do?
Oh, you did get a mock review, weren't you?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, playing something for a mock review. So I was diligently playing that, getting my hours in, trying to squeeze in a little bit of Switch 2.
I'm quite manic in my Switch 2 playing. I seem to dart from game to game. I play like half an hour of Tears of Kingdom, and then for some reason, 10 minutes of Wind Waker, and then because I'm holding the GameCube wireless controller, which of course I purchased, and then I'm into the Mario All-Stars collection to play Mario Sunshine with the GameCube controller as God intended.
So I've really been all over the place. Yeah, very scattershot. I don't know if that's an indicator that there's like that core single player experience that you would normally like anchor a launch around is missing.
Perhaps.
Yeah, that was something we didn't really discuss on the Switch 2 episode, wasn't it? Was the idea of whether it was something I had in my notes originally, but then we just ran out of time. We had other things to discuss was whether it was like the right launch title by itself.
And it's been a bit of a point of discussion. I think the fact that maybe a lot of people are saying they cycle in and out of playing Mario Kart would suggest that there is a hunger for something else. I think it's a perfectly great launch title by itself.
I can see why people might interrogate that. But I'm not too invested in that discourse for the simple fact that we're one month away from having another major exclusive in this launch window. So it doesn't seem like it's worth getting too hung up on because perspectives on that will shift pretty quickly.
But what did you think of that?
As long as Donkey Kong is good.
Astrobot Killer, here we come. What did you think of that discourse, Matthew? I'm assuming you do think that Mario Kart is the right launch title based on what you've played.
I understand Mario Kart. I mean, just in terms of it being the biggest thing they have, but also given that they are trying to push a little bit of connectivity functionality with game chat and the general online features. Having this always on game, almost like service game, kind of humming in the background, it makes perfect sense for that to be there at launch and for it to launch with something online in the knowledge that once you've spent a month getting your head around it all, you will hopefully have meaty Astrobot Killer Donkey Kong to enjoy.
Yeah, exactly, and there's always fast fusion in the meantime. You're not much of a wipeout guy. I was wondering if you gave that a go and had a...
Are you bound to have bought this? You bought the fucking camera.
No, I haven't. Shin'en, Shin'en, however it's pronounced, the people who make that game have always made technically quite shiny things. Even from the WiiWare days, they did a game called Art of Balance, which was quite handsome.
I've just never really been into the games they make. They're always impressive, and they always punch above their weight visually, compared to basically what anyone else is doing on these consoles. They got a little bit of factor five about them, like an indie factor five, in that they're kind of like the Nintendo console whisperers, and manage to kind of unlock something that no one else can.
But the actual games themselves, yeah, something that kind of hues more, wipe out than F-Zero. Yeah, it's just not for me.
Yeah, fair enough. I felt like one of those games I might buy, play for like 10 minutes, then just leave to sort of collect dust, metaphorically speaking, in the old Switch 2 digital library, so once shinier things come out. So yeah, I get the sort of, I think it's like smart opportunism to jump in there, while people are looking for something new, with an actual exclusive, like whether it stays exclusive or not, is kind of a, probably won't, I'm guessing, because there's no real reason to do that these days, but it worked for Golf Story back on the Switch, didn't it?
And I think it's, it's a very specific example.
Who can forget the heady days of Golf Story?
I then did have a follow up that was kind of a disaster, was like Sports Story or something, and it was all like, it ended in tears. I think something like that happened, but.
It was a bit like Metal Gear Solid 2, in that everyone thought it'd be the golfer from the first game that they loved, and it was this other dude. But it was all very meta in the end, about the kind of nature of Golf, so it was all right.
Yeah, you and I understand Golf better than anyone, so that really...
Yeah, if I knew anything more about Golf, I would have been able to pad that little bit of whimsy out into something a bit more substantial. Instead, it didn't really go anywhere.
Yeah, I mean, fair enough, Tiger Woods, Rory McElroy, those are all the golfers I can name Matthew. I could go on, but I won't, because I literally... Happy New Year...
.Mario. I literally can't go on. Okay, then we get to the mailbag part of this episode then.
Many questions here, some of which I think made Matthew sigh and me sigh, and some of which were kind of quite stimulating. There's a bit of a mix of the two, as ever, in the mailbag, Matthew.
But also as ever, we appreciate that people are invested enough in this podcast that they submit questions.
That's very important to point out, yes. Also, we've got very nice feedback to both the Switch 2 episode we did, Matthew, and the Patreon episode that we did recently. So, yeah, good stuff.
All right. So this first question then is from Reg McFly. As an English teacher, was there anything you read at school that really impacted you in your later life?
For some reason, my senior year high school teacher stuck Don Quixote into my head, and he will never leave. As writers, did anything ever impact you hard? Also, large men, I am a massive sucker for a gimmick food or drink slash cocktail based around a movie or game experience.
What was the best themed food and or drink you ever had at a games PR event? So both these questions, Matthew, I've had a few answers to these, nothing hugely in depth. But what have you got?
Let's tackle the first bit first. So I'm curious if anything from your school days like resonated with you or changed you as a human.
Yeah, in some ways, I think that I've probably referenced all of these stories on the podcast at some point because I'm not as well read as I should be. And so I end up having the same few references back to back of like, educating Rita of Mice and Men and The Handmaid's Tale, which just come up over and over again. Yeah, I think of Mice and Men has got a lot of like, it's like a lot of meat on the bone for parody of Mice and Men, which sounds like ridiculous for a John Steinbeck story, where his stories are all about like the depression and the effect on like America, so maybe it's not appropriate for me to tell my partner that she has Big Curly's wife energy, you know, but like nonetheless these are the sort of things that come up.
These are the thoughts you have.
The Handmaid's Tale came up recently because I think I made the point to someone that because someone was saying, oh wow, America is closer to the Handmaid's Tale than ever. And I pointed out that Trump is too stupid to come up with the name Gilead. He'd never call it that.
It would be called like, just be called like America, colon, the United States of America or something like that. Something so fucking thick.
Sex town.
Yeah, exactly.
Welcome to sex town, technically a state.
Exactly, never come up with Gilead. Fucking idiot. So that's not gonna happen.
Educating Rita, I think I've referenced at some point in this podcast as being a bit of a tough hang of a story. But I did learn about Ratatouille from that before the Pixar film came out. That's when I learned what that food stuff was, Matthew.
I'd say watching The Simpsons had more of an effect on my writing than any of those, to be honest. Just through sheer sort of like volume of watching it over and over again, every day for years and years. But you went to uni as well as school, so I'm guessing you've got some probably meatier answers for this one.
Not really. I mean, all those were pretty good. The problem is, I think a lot of the stuff you read in school, you don't have any choice over what it is.
And then you do like a book, a term or year or whatever it is. I can't remember how long these things are stretched out. And they become quite abstract when you take them in that kind of bitty way.
Books have moved me, just not necessarily the ones teachers set. When I was at university, we had to do some Middle English poetry, kind of Chaucer era. And there was this 14th century Chaucerian poet, as in wrote in the Chaucerian tradition, called Thomas Hockleaf.
And he's not particularly famous, really. It's like, it's a little bit Chaucer robust. But he also kind of like wrote about that.
And he was quite an anxious guy, and would write these poems that were like petitioning patrons to kind of give him work and employ him as their in-house poet or whatever. So he wrote these poems about just like what a miserable sort of soddy is. I think actually the word miserable, the first recorded use of it is in one of his poems.
All right.
I know which is a great accolade, isn't it? To be able to have to your name that I used miserable for anyone else.
That's the kind of accolade that you and I aspire to, I think, you know, that's our dream to coin something like that, something downbeat that gets used over and over again.
Yeah, gravy, meaning good. In years from now, everyone's saying everything's gravy.
But I didn't even create that, unfortunately.
Yeah, what I liked about him wasn't not necessarily the poems himself, but that when you read this stuff, you were like, here's someone 700 years ago, writing about being unhappy and being a bit of a fuck up and being worried about their work and that they're not going to get money for writing. And you were like, this feels like a real person who's very recognizable now. And it may sound dumb, but it's easy to see a lot of literature as being so distant that it's unrelatable.
You don't really think of them as living, breathing people. But I did like that in terms of there have always been people who are kind of unhappy with their lot and worried about things and kind of moaning about things. And it's quite funny that he did it in these poems that we're now reading 700 years later as part of this degree.
Yeah. That was what I had for that.
Well, that's a very, you know, it's a good, thoughtful answer. Mine was just a list of things and an off-colour gag.
A list of things and then you said you preferred The Simpsons. Steinbeck Groaning. Sounds about right.
Yeah, basically. I mean, I'm sure that won't surprise anyone who's listened to 200 plus episodes of this podcast at this point. Okay.
So the gimmick of themed food and drink, Matthew, I actually struggle to think of many that suit this. So I don't think many places have been to have really done anything that elaborate. I got a couple of examples.
I went to, I think the Mafia 3 trip I went on, where we all went on a boat, had some kind of like, like down, down south cuisine on it, like jambalaya or gumbo or something like that. Something like sort of that came out of a bowl that was served locally.
I mean, that could be anything.
It really could be. But I remember that being a particular New Orleans focused meal, because you know, that's what the setting of the game was based on.
Yeah.
And then I thought about the two Fallout events we did last year, Matthew, when we had the themed food at the, in my job then. That was, those were really cool themed dishes. But I couldn't think of anything like going really far back.
Like I couldn't remember early press trips that had this sort of thing. I don't know. Could anything come to mind for you?
No, it was always this mini burgers, lots and lots of mini burgers, forcing you to eat like eight of them to have the single, regular burger experience. But so it goes. I went to the Dragon Quest Cafe in Tokyo, where they had meat bun shaped like slimes and a jellyfish salad, which was meant to be the Sting Slime, which is like the blue slime with the tentacles.
That was pretty gross. Quite recently, there was a, I think it was for Doom the Dark Ages, but a white chocolate skull turned up in the office. This incredible crafted skull, it really looked like a skull.
But it was made of such dense white chocolate that even the stronger members of the office were struggling to chisel bits off it. It was on the social area for just weeks, and every once in a while, you'd hear an incredibly loud crunch from the social area as someone took a hammer to this skull to try and have a little nibble. That was quite heavy duty.
You needed one of those Doom the Dark Ages, is it the Ravager? What's the gun that chews three skulls?
I put that skull in and just fire it into my mouth, as my face becomes embedded with razor shards of white chocolate. Imagine trying to explain that to a fricking bath hospital. It's like, what have you done here?
This isn't your regular Milky Bar accident.
Yeah, the doctor goes, welcome back Mr Castle. I think your dentist will have more to say than your doctor, to be honest.
Well, I didn't have any of it, because I'm trying to be a bit healthier and all that. Did you get back in the day when GTA 4 came out, did you get sent the Pisfasa?
Yes, I did. I had, I think, two crates of Pisfasa and it took me ages to get through them. The themed in-universe GTA 4 beer.
That was like the classic one that I could think of, because those things were everywhere on desks. I kept one because I thought it might be worth something one day. I had this bottle of Pisfasa slowly changing color on my desk for about four years in the future.
Never opened it, lost it in a desk move, so not a great end to that and it don't. Between that and the borderland top trumps, that's the nest egg.
Do you mind if I mention briefly, Matthew, that your dental spooks in the last few years have made me worry about my teeth more? So I just went to the dentist today and for the first time ever they praised my brushing. Because I think last time, I think when you said the words Irreversible Pulpitus on this podcast, it lit a fire under me like oh you get to a certain age and then like your teeth are just no longer like a guarantee anymore that they're going to be fine.
And so I bought like a half price but pretty expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush and I've been absolutely like sanding those bad boys down in advance of the dentist.
24-7.
Yeah that's it and like a plaque no more it's all gone but that's because that's because you on this podcast actually frightened me into doing that. I don't know is that do you consider like a good thing or a bad thing that that's happened?
Well I'm glad like I wouldn't wish my teeth was on anyone. Incidentally I think I was misdiagnosed with Irreversible Pulpitus because it's meant to be agony and it got it kind of cleared up after a couple of years but like it shouldn't clear up. Irreversible, you know?
So I don't think it can be that because I've been alright since then. Well I say I've been alright since then. I did.
What was it? I smashed a tooth on over the Easter holiday, oh a bad fruit that I had never heard of.
Oh yeah, oh yeah and I called you a tori.
It was like a tiny plum for pretentious wankers and anyone who knows about it's awful. What was it called?
See I can't even remember because I've literally never encountered it.
Damsun.
Damsun, that was it, yeah. That wasn't the thing I called you a tori for eating. That was those little chocolates you got at Christmas.
That was also bad form.
We got really dinged in the online discourse for not knowing what a Damsun is.
They don't have Damsuns in Gospor. They've only just got fucking bananas there. Do you know what I mean?
It's like World War II Blitz era down there man. Like what do you want from me? These things are still blowing my mind.
I remember when I moved to Bath and I'd never heard of Sampire and I went in like the Morrisons in Bath and they had like a big old display of like, there was like for some reason steam coming off the little kind of like fridge bit of in the middle of the vegetable and it just this beautiful looking vegetable there and it turned out to be Sampire Matthew. I think that's a pretty well known vegetable but I didn't, I had my first Sampire till the age of 25. I'm not ashamed to admit that, you know.
If you put a gun to my head and said I'm going to kill you unless you draw a Sampire I would be dead. I can't tell you what that looks like. What does that look like?
That sounds like something from, is this a punk? Is this actually something from Elder Scrolls? That sounds like a fantasy fruit.
It's quite naturally salty and tastes beautiful because it's naturally salty. But I think it does tend to be served in fine dining situations. It's not that expensive but it just looks like bits of little branches off a tree or something.
It's just green and you're sort of quite chewy, that's always the way.
I've never had that.
I still couldn't draw you a Damson, I'd probably just draw a Plum and hope for the best, and then sort of colour it in.
And hope that the gunman is forgiving.
Exactly.
In this quite strange scenario we've created.
With that, we move on to question two, after 20 minutes with about 40 questions left to go, which bodes well for the podcast ahead Matthew, you read this one.
You are put in charge of the development of a big budget JRPG. The first thing you have to decide is the country in which your development studio will be based. The catch is that all of your employees will be extreme caricatures of what an English person thinks people from that country are like, and the game, although still identifiably a JRPG, will be profoundly influenced by that team's cultural perspective, and will wear that influence very heavily.
Which country do you choose and why? This is from TJ Cleaver, and I think it's basically re-riffing on the Frenchness of Clare Obscure, right?
Yeah, I think so. It's basically because that kind of uses it as a loose sort of like, not even loose, but like a cultural through line to the game. But it's weird because I still think of it as like the French-Japanese RPG.
I still don't really think of it as like a French game in any stereotypical way, but the question sort of makes it sound like it kind of is. I mean, there's obviously the outfits and like the baguette and stuff, but I don't know. Anyway, my answer to this one, Matthew, I was going to go with Ireland for this one because people romanticize it a lot and therefore it probably translates quite well to a Japanese RPG.
I won't comment on the caricature element of the question as I've upset the Irish enough on this podcast and it seems like a trap by TJ Cleaver. So yeah, Ireland kind of came to mind. I think there was a game that was like an RPG inspired by Spanish sort of like lore, like this Spanish trail.
It was about six years ago it came out. I previewed it on PC Gamer. I think it was like a Kickstarter game.
I cannot remember what it was called. It was inspired by Dragon Age Origins. Didn't get very good reviews, but they did try and do something that was, that used cultural inspiration rather than like fantasy universe sort of stuff.
That came to mind. And then I guess like The Thaumaturge is sort of the Polish version of Clare Obscure, isn't it, in a way? It's like a, it's got a persona style relationship building, I believe.
I've not played it. And it's, but it's, it's entirely set in like Poland in one time period. So not exactly the same as Clare Obscure either.
But those came to mind as like existing ones, Matthew. But what was your take on this question?
Yeah, it's tricky because it all sounds like whatever you say, you're going to get into trouble. I thought maybe Denmark because, you know, when I think of Denmark and I think of Brits relationship with Denmark, you've probably got the concept of who is it? Hygge, H-Y-G-G-E, the cosiness, the cosy sort of Danish aesthetic that was quite like all the craze about 10 years ago, maybe five years ago.
So you've kind of got this, you know, like chunky jumpers and big log fires and being inside a warm cabin when it's snowy outside. That's quite a nice aesthetic. But then you've also got the kind of like Scandi crime, the more kind of clinical glassy buildings, I guess more like your kind of Hitman world view, where everything is very sort of stark and architecturally precise.
So like a collision of the harder world and that kind of softer world. I'd be into a game which did that.
Yeah, that makes sense. I could see why that would be very much your kind of area as a sort of point of inspiration.
Sorry, not a laugh riot that one.
Sorry. I mean, yeah, we answered your question, TJ. Cleaver, I hope you're happy.
I can see why.
I don't want to be like, oh, you get your health back by eating Ikea meatballs and all this kind of stuff.
Yeah, and I don't want to go into like, if I had to explain what was actually in the Ireland Japanese RPG, I'm opening myself up to all kinds of trouble. You know what I mean? I'm not saying that like the main quest giver is Bono.
You know what I mean? Like I'd sort of, I'd try harder than that. But anyway, I think it's best to...
I had to look up some Irish slang recently for a, we were doing like a video pitch at work and we were pitching this little kind of Irish slang quiz thing. And I found a site and it had so many things I'd never heard of. One was sort of stuck with me as an image.
It referred to someone being able to eat an apple through a letter box.
Oh right. That's very specific.
Just meaning that they had giant teeth.
Okay. That is like, that's like a bit of a lateral thinking puzzle rather than like a phrase I would say. Do you know what I mean?
That's like a, try and work out the context from this phrase. It's not like apples and pears, do you know what I mean? I think that's a pretty direct one to one line of what that is to, you know, what it means.
Yeah, yeah. That's what got me about it. But that could be a mini game in your Irish JRPG.
I mean, I do love the way that ClarabSkill uses that kind of like, it's not just like a French iconography. It's like the, there's something about the, like the island full of those little lads. That's the little guys.
And like, it's just very, very French in a kind of like classic Ubisoft sort of way. And it really just elevates the game in this, yeah, in this particular fashion. So yeah, I can see why it would be cool to see this sort of thing.
But the real secret source of that game is that the, it looks amazing and the combat's really good. And it's very generous considering it's, well, I'm not getting into the team size discourse. That's genuinely the most fucking boring thing that has happened in games this year is people arguing about whether 30 French people made this game or not.
Get a fucking life and play some computer games instead. That's how I feel about that, Matthew. Okay, next question then.
Hello gentlemen of Impeccable Size. I know both of you have had periods of time away from games media, and I was curious if you felt that taking a break from the day-to-day churn of covering games professionally changed your relationship with the medium. And when you both went back into more traditional games media roles, Matthew at PlayStation Access for example, if you found yourselves approaching games differently or slipped back into old habits, love the pod and keep it up.
Liam Richardson. Full editor Liam Richardson.
Yeah, Liam did edit some of our Excel episodes early in the lifespan of the Patreon, which we were very grateful for. And make sure you tell the tax man Liam, because if he comes after us, we'd set him in your way. Up to new person.
That's basically the contract we sign with every contributor to this podcast. I hope you got your shit in order, because we don't want to get dragged down into any of your malfeasance.
Oh, the funny thing is Matthew's brother is an actual accountant, but he doesn't like asking his brother about tax stuff with the podcast. In case he finds out that we've been doing it wrong and we're going to go to jail.
I'm so sure we haven't been doing it wrong, which I know isn't really like a strong legal footing, but I am convinced we're all right.
Yeah, I think it's okay. I've looked it up and we probably need a written agreement somewhere. We can get into this off air, Matthew.
So the answer to the question then, okay. So I think that a key thing is the break. Coming back to it actually makes me realize how old I am.
Because there's a difference between me working on TechRadar when I was 33 and Games Edition got based on 37. Like I can't, when I was on PC Gamer, there was just like so many times where I had to do about three different jobs at once. And I just can't physically do that anymore.
Like I just don't have the stamina for it. So I do think there's a certain amount of reaching an age where you have to work smarter rather than harder and that's kind of the way it needs to be, or I don't think it does work. So yeah, that came to mind a little bit Matthew.
In terms of the actual process, I think I just have more confidence editorially in my voice. You know what I mean? I don't really, I think maybe doing this podcast has helped a lot.
I never quite felt like I found my voice as a writer when I was a games journalist, but there's something about doing this podcast. I feel like I have figured that out somehow. I know what my takes are on different things.
I know what perspective I'm coming from on things. I'm not trying to blend in to other outlets in quite the same way. I was trying to just sort of blend in with the back, blend in with the wallpaper on PC Gamer when I first started there.
But these days, I obviously respect the style guide of any outlet I work on, but also I kind of know what my imprint is going to be on the writing. So yeah, those are like my broad thoughts in this, Matthew, but what about you?
I only respect an outlet's style guide if it's Games Master's style guide circa 2006 that told me that instead of saying fart to say phantom bum egg, which is a story I got to tell in the Geraint episode, which is always nice to say to a head of publishing at a games company. I don't know, because I sort of feel like I keep dipping in and out of it all. I must have sometimes feel a little bit like the kind of ghost at the feast in that I'm not in the world, but looking on quite jealously, constantly thinking about what would I do if I had access to X, Y and Z.
Kind of it's a weird thing kind of being out of it. I definitely think about it a lot. You're always kind of like, is there a way to do this full time?
But I just don't think there is. But luckily I do have the podcast as a pressure release. In terms of actually like going back to it and like whether anything had changed.
I mean, I guess there's a bit of the age thing. Like you say, every time you go back, you're working with increasingly younger people. That's another part of it.
Just the new kind of influx of people are in their early 20s and you really begin to feel that gap. Do we appear at all scary to these people in the way that those people did to us when we joined? Probably not.
They're probably like, who the fuck is this? And that's okay. On a more technical level, like going into video on Xbox and then PlayStation Access and Rock Paper Shotgun and going back into that video, I do have like a weird way of doing things when I'm working on a video channel that I wouldn't normally when I was, you know, just used to be writing and when I'm doing other kinds of freelance.
I have weird habits in terms of playing games, preparing them to be in videos. So like, looking for strange little interactions that will look funny in a video, you know, going out of my way to test that kind of stuff and having incredibly granular safe systems so I can access any bit of the game that I might need for capture. Maybe not what the question was asking about, but I, like, I have a just genuinely a different way of playing games when I know that there might be a video at the other end of it.
Apart from that, it hasn't changed hugely. Like, when I write an EDGE review now, I'm still stressing out in exactly the same way that I did when I reviewed the first thing I ever reviewed for EDGE, you know, 16 years ago. So, no growth.
Yeah. Well, I think that the truth that you sort of come back to is that writing is just really, really hard to do well. And, you know, it does, it requires, it always requires multiple drafts.
And I, when I, my first piece in ages and years was the PC Gamer, Dynasty Warriors Origins, a review I did, and it took me about three times longer to write the text than I thought it would. I set aside a Sunday evening to write it, and then it took me the Sunday and then all of the next Monday to get it to a state I was happy with. And I really polished it up to the point where I was like, that is airtight.
That's probably better than any piece I wrote when I was on TechRadar or when I was originally on PC Gamer, because normally when you're on company time, you're weighing up the kind of hours of like, I've got to do all these different tasks. So at some point it can only be so good. And it's the internet.
There isn't an infinite amount of time necessarily. There's always more jobs to do. Whereas I guess with this, I was being paid for my time, but the per hour rate is obviously down to the writer in some ways.
And so by putting that much effort in, I made it like less good value as freelance, but I did also want it to be really good. So that was the decision I made. And that's kind of like the tension of being a writer, I think, sometimes.
It's like accepting that through sheer volume. You can't be Kieran Gillan writing like two reviews that people loved years ago when PC Gamer had a gigantic team size. Most of us never get to be that because it's just not how games media works.
It is like basically a bit of a factory line in some ways. Volume is a part of it. So I thought about this actually when that guy who wrote that Guardian GTA 4 piece about taking a load of drugs was a writer on Andor.
I thought if that guy had to write update like the release schedule, Tom something or other, what's his name? Bissell. I thought if Tom Bissell had to update like the play magazine release schedule in March 2007, would he have gone on to be a writer on Andor?
Or was it just an era where you could write one or two bits of games journalism and people are like, wow, magnificent. If you're in the daily churn of it, you're just destined never to get the same respect because the economics of it are so different. That is definitely not what Liam was asking, but I thought about this a little bit.
I like the idea of someone going, I took a load of drugs and then wrote a contents page for Games Master. And like, numbers lost all meaning.
Yeah, it's not to say that I don't think those people deserve their success. I think, you know, Kieran, Tom, very talented people, but it just feels like a completely different world. And yeah, it's just always that trade-off between quality and time, you know.
I must admit, sometimes when I see, you know, a journalist's name or a name that I recognize breaking out and like making it as a screenwriter or getting into TV or doing something that I'm jealous of, basically, and then you look them up and you find their games journalism and see that, you know, they had to write crappy news stories where they recycled a press release. And you think, oh, that's all right. Like, actually, the crappy recycling doesn't read that different to my crappy recycling.
So in theory, we can both end up exactly where they are now. It probably doesn't really work like that.
That's really funny.
I think on this Venn diagram, there is some crossover, so it could still be total crossover. Potentially, you know, we're not just completely orbiting each other.
Did I include the question in this that was about AI in games journalism? Did I include that in the end? Or did I cut it because it's a bad hang, Matthew?
I can't remember.
There was an AI question, but I didn't write any notes for it. So I'm like, I just didn't want to talk about it.
Yeah, someone asked, I think someone asked about, how do you think AI will affect games journalism? And I think the tricky thing is that it's going to destroy big chunks of it because it just steals information and puts it out.
But well, I think if this piece of software can rewrite this press release into a news story and I can also do that, then maybe I could one day be worth a hundred billion dollars. You see, on the Venn diagram, me and the Eat Chat GBT, there's some crossover.
But who requires more water, Matthew Castle or Chat GBT? That's the question, Matthew. And I think you'll find your good value by comparison to that, in terms of water consumption.
If you pour a Pepsi Max into Chat V, GBT, it's fucked.
That's very true.
It just explodes. I imagine it's a computer, like a desktop tower. That's what I'm imagining.
Yeah. Every time I buy a new PC and I find out it's got holes in the top, I'm always a bit like, oh, I'm definitely going to pour a milkshake down there at some point. That's going to happen.
The problem is that Google has just defined this entire narrative, that all these websites have spun up with the sole purpose of driving search traffic to increase volume of readers. They are now trapped by Google, that they can't really reverse out of it and go back to user-supported model, which is what these sites now need in order to exist against AI harvesting their work. Because if you're supported by your community like we are, very fortunately, again, I'd like to see AI come up with your takes on Nintendo Switch 2 welcome tool, Matthew.
I just don't think it's got the juice, the sauce, or the gravy to do that personally. But yeah, I think it means that I think if people could rewind the clock and go more for that direct audience, they'd go much more for the personality driven web writing. But it's that thing of I wonder if that will happen.
It's just tricky to do it in reverse basically. It's tricky to get to an extinction level event and be like, now we really need your support in order to keep going. Because this stuff is definitely going to have an effect on traffic and probably already is.
But that's some grim thoughts there Matthew. But I think it's probably an honest answer. Like if any form of games journalism that you engage with, it's probably under threat from this.
That's just the truth of it.
Don't worry because we've got an equally hard hitting question coming up next.
Okay then. So moving on then to, hello, do you have a favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry's ice cream? What would be the name and flavor of the official back page Ben and Jerry's ice cream?
Thoughts Cashew. That's from Naeslin.
From the sublime to the ridiculous. ChatGBT could not have written that.
Thoughts Cashew is a Sean original. Well done Naeslin. Very good.
Matthew, I've never had Ben and Jerry's for my own protection really. I think if I got on that train, I'd never get off and then I'd just die 45 stone. However, I did come up with it's open brackets, cookie close brackets, dough from me, dog.
That's what I came up with.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah. I mean, it's great in the most tenuous way possible. Thoughts Cashew is way better than that.
Thoughts Cashew is elegant and wonderful. What have you got for this one?
Well, I haven't had Ben and Jerry's for a long time, but I quite like the fish food, the one which had the little hard chocolate fishes in them. That was all right. If I was to have a Back Page one, all I could come up with was Two Giant Ben.
That's pretty good. I quite like that. Yeah.
There's nothing that rhymes with Ben, though, is there, food-wise. That was a problem. I took Two Giant Men and then I literally typed in words that rhyme with men and then went through them, realized there was no food stuff in there, and then thought about what else do we say on the podcast?
And then It's a No From Me Dog came up and then I found a word finally that rhymed with one word in that sentence, Matthew. So there's the behind the scenes of the banter in this podcast episode. Okay.
Well, I was so relieved when I thought of Two Giant Ben at lunchtime. I was like, oh, I've got one. This is great.
I'm not going to lie.
I was hoping for a bigger reaction. Sorry. Slightly, slightly deflated by that.
Slightly less giant man than I was before.
Sorry. The only reason was because I studied the way that they phrase these quite well. They are normally a pun that have a food name in them.
So with yours, I immediately went, oh, what's the food element in there?
I was just riffing on the fact that one of them is called Ben.
Yeah, I know that in retrospect, but because I had to think about it for a second, I didn't laugh. Should we do another take where I like?
That's okay. It's fine. It's important that people hear the raw take.
Sorry. It's a Monday evening. I promise I will laugh at more of your gags.
That had big like when I've just absolutely shit the bed in the intro to Games Court energy.
No.
When you say it and you're just like, wait for the laughter.
I still think you're a comedy genius, Matthew. I just didn't immediately get it. I apologize.
I'm probably just short circuiting because it's been a long day. Okay. Let's go to the next question, Matthew.
Did I read this one?
Hello, GC lads. Given that games these days rarely, if ever, get released in their final state, does this ever act as a deterrent against buying games on day one? When you look at the patch history of something like Borders Gate 3, it's a significantly different game today than it was on release.
Even though it received tens across the board on day one, it's such a long game that most people won't play it through multiple times, so will likely miss out on the quality of life updates and extra content if they've already completed it. House of Games industry in 2025 created a scenario where gamers have to choose between an imperfect game on day one versus waiting for the best version of a game 6-12 months later but missing out on the latest hit. Gaming, unlike other media, now seems to be an industry where the review score slash experience could be vastly different depending on when you play the game.
I imagine GTA 6 will be immune to such a dilemma but will likely be a very different game one year down the line. Thanks for all the great content, Stevie.
I don't think I really really believe this in any kind of serious way because I think the state that it's in in day one is what's key. So for example, I was out of games media when Cyberpunk came out, so I didn't get a key for it or anything. And so I decided to buy it myself and I chose not to buy it until they'd rolled out some quite serious patches for it because the critical reception was so cool and when it was on PS5 as well.
So whenever we did that Cyberpunk episode like three years ago or something, that was when I first played it. We're sort of at Baldur's Gate 3. I mean at launch as in not the early access launch but the commercial launch in 2023, like the proper launch, that was already in a great state as well.
So I feel like the quality of life additions there, while good, are maybe for some of the very real diehard players who want to go back in to that game and make that game their whole personalities and play it over and over again, which is definitely a thing that's happening at Baldur's Gate 3. It's one of those generationally successful games. It's just going to be around forever.
So yeah, I don't really think this is a big deal, really. I think if a game is shit at launch, that is a big deal. But if a game is good at launch and then it gets better with quality of life updates, not really the end of the world.
Maybe the closest borderline case I got with this was Jelly Survivor having all those performance issues, Matthew, because it was just like you're burying a great game under all this bullshit, and it definitely affected their review scores as well. So yeah, that comes to mind. But I can't say this really, I think about this that much.
What do you think?
Yeah, not really. I mean, especially the question of like, would you withhold? I mean, as a games writer or a critic or whatever, you probably wouldn't want to kind of miss out on the conversation.
That conversation is at its most valuable to most readers anyway, off the bat, you know, at the start of a game being released. I do think it is interesting, like the journey some games can take, you know, like Cyberpunk basically gutting its skill system and having like a completely different kind of progression when it did the big, I think that was for Phantom Liberty, when they did the expansion, they kind of did a big overhaul of just, you know, how everything worked in that game. And, you know, as a result, it is quite a different game.
And if not worth a re-evaluation, certainly worth kind of playing and experiencing and seeing if it answers some of your criticisms of it. I do think it's kind of interesting as well that there are versions of games that don't exist anymore. You know, like, oh, that thing that I played, you know, like Cyberpunk, you know, it's been so changed that that's kind of novel as well.
And I wouldn't want to have missed out on having that experience and understanding that story.
You were out there downgrading Cyberpunk 2077 to its 2022 version, Matthew.
Yeah.
The original experience.
Well, you know what I mean? You're kind of like, well, I was there. I mean, I was about to say arguably the art of game making is like getting these things out on a day and then letting them be played and judged as they are then.
I mean, that isn't true. You know, they are changeable things now in the, like the online era. But I still value and really rate games that release as cleanly as they can.
I still think that's the aim or should be. You know, that's why I do like a lot of Nintendo games. I feel like what they are is what they are, you know?
And, but I don't know, yeah.
I'll echo what Stevie says at the end of this, Matthew, and say thanks for all the great content, but that's in relation to your answer to that question.
You don't have to treat me with kid gloves because you didn't laugh at the Two Giant Ben.
Oh, I felt so bad about that. I just was, I don't think I was paying proper attention.
No, no, no, it wasn't good enough. It's fine.
No, I think you're a funny guy.
No, it's fine.
You're the secret source of the podcast. You're the comedy sidekick. And I'm the straight man.
That's like how this works, you know.
No, it's honestly fine.
We're entering Jerry Lewis territory again here. It's not where we want to be, you know. It's all good.
Two Giant Ben... I thought I was going to call this episode Mailbag Two Giant Ben Edition. I think that's just well worth it.
That's made me laugh the idea of that, actually. See, I'm laughing at the joke now.
You finally get a laugh out of the Something That's Two Giant Ben Adjacent.
Okay. Next question. At the risk of this podcast turning into a feud.
It's from Bob Bob Robert Robert. Hi lads. If you could be on the official director's commentary for any film in which you interview the director while you watch it with them, which film would you choose?
And for a bonus question, which game would you do the same thing with? And which individual who worked on it would you interview? Well, that will serve me right, Bob Bob, because I didn't read the last part of your question until just now.
So I'll come up with an answer on the fly. While Matthew Castle knows a lot more about film than me, answers this question first of all. I can't wait to hear your answers, Matthew.
So go for it.
Well, I didn't struggle with this one, but it's the aim to... Because there's people who've done good director's commentaries for films that I love, and I know that they're kind of good for it. Do you actually pick something that you like, but you don't know a huge amount about, just to move the needle on what we know about that game, or that film?
I don't really know what the right way of approaching this imaginary task is. I picked... And it's not my favourite film, it's not my favourite director, but I would quite like to talk to Ryan Johnson in general about murder mystery stuff, because he's a big murder mystery guy.
So, like, one of his knives out films, maybe Glass Onion, because there's no director's commentaries on Netflix films. But that's really just because I want to... I just want to basically get him for two hours to talk about which books he's into, which writers he's into, because that's very much my jam.
Again, sorry, it's not a hilarious answer, but it's the truth.
I thought you were going to say, that bloke what directed The Spanish Prisoner, Matthew? Which I always depend on you to bring up that, or the last of Sheila.
David Mamet.
Oh, yeah. You and David Mamet would be a great... I'd listen to that.
But David Mamet is quite a problematic character these days.
He's gone a bit off the deep end.
I think people would not take it in the way it was intended, which is I want to talk strictly about The Spanish Prisoner and be like, whitewashing, oh, David Mamet, are you? Improve of everything David Mamet says, and you're like, I just want to talk about The Spanish Prisoner.
I thought about this when we ran an interview with Mundfish on the GI a few weeks ago.
There's a bit of controversy around them because they didn't denounce the invasion of Ukraine. They definitely had the big STF because they're all over that show, weren't they? They had that game, ill with a big fetid baby.
It's quite memorable trailer, to be fair. Atomic Heart 2, which looks so vague, the theme of that. That was a massive shrug from me, and another game with a big cube.
I thought about this a lot recently. I was like, oh, is it by interviewing them, by discussing anything with these people, like are you platforming them, therefore, would that be considered a form of whitewashing? So, see what you mean, Matthew.
So, Ryan Johnson is a lot more inoffensive by comparison.
He's done nothing to offend him. If anything, he's a bit of an internet fave, because he's Natasha Lyonne adjacent, and she's the internet's fave.
She was.
By connections, I'd be all right.
Yeah, I can see that. So, I thought about the thing you said as well, about how there's like a, is it okay to force someone to talk to me about their film? Because I think the answer on some level would be, I'd love to ask David Fincher about Alien 3.
I'm sure a lot of people would. But that is a man who's very mercurial in interviews more generally. So, I think he would probably, and he's disowned that film, so probably wouldn't want to talk about it.
But I would obviously love to ask him questions about that. If he's trapped with me and he has to answer my questions, maybe give that a go. But I just know on the day that I'd have an anxiety attack about the whole thing, I'd just really start to panic.
If not, I thought something like a classic comedy would probably be the best hang, because I'm probably a bit more, I'm always cracking wise or whatever. So, I'm not sure that me and Scorsese on The Age of Innocence is necessarily going to be a good hang for anyone. But something like Ben Stiller on Tropic Thunder, you know what I mean?
Ben Stiller and Tom Cruise on Tropic Thunder, that might be fun.
You get to enlist actors, well if I get to enlist actors then Spanish Prisoner becomes even more attractive, because I could counter David Mamet with a bit of Steve Martin.
Yeah, I think that would definitely balance out. You're right, I've broken the question there, so yeah, it would have to be Ben Stiller. But that would be good, Tropic Thunder is a fun film.
There's things to interrogate about whether that film would like, well I'm talking about The Black Face, would that be acceptable?
Yes. What about those two that did 21 Jump Street?
Oh, Lord and Miller. I think they'd be a good hang. I'm not sure how many interviews I've really seen with those guys, but yeah, I think I quite enjoy doing that.
I don't know, I think I'd have like five questions and I'd run out after about 45 minutes, you know what I mean? Then I'd just be like, hey, can you just give me some, tell me about this bit, point at the screen, tell me about the bit where Channing Tatum was off his head on drugs or whatever, and tell me about casting Rob Riggle. What was Rob like in the room?
You know, that kind of thing. I think I would definitely struggle on that one. Okay, what about the game part of this question, Matthew?
Too obvious to say, Kojima. Nothing really came to mind for this, but.
I thought maybe like talking to Peter Molyneux about a game he'd made, because he's always talking about what he's gonna do next. Like, so much of the focus on him is like the hype and the potential. You know, he has talked about things in the past, and he's done like career postmortems and things, but like, just to sit down and do like, you know, let's talk Fable 2 or whatever.
And, you know, I know you can't pin any game on one person, but it just struck me that I've heard him talk a lot about these games before they come out, but I'd like to get into what it actually is now it's out. I think that would be valuable.
Yeah, I think I said that's a nice answer. I was trying to think of like all my questions, my answers be just quite obvious ones about like Bioshock and stuff. I couldn't really get to...
I mean, that would be great. But like, if you did have Ken Levine, like what would it be? Bioshock 1?
Infinite. Oh, Infinite.
Oh, I was so asked about Infinite. Because there's obviously a game that broke the brains of everyone who worked on it, I think. It's just so, we're just, it took so long to come out.
And it's so controversial. And, you know, kind of unfinished, really, the original game by itself. So, yeah, I would definitely, I take it back, actually, asking Ken Levine about that would be awesome.
Because even Jeremy Peel asking about that in Edge was very thrilling for me, you know? And he didn't even have the game there as a sort of like a tool. Just the other day, actually, I was discussing, I was boring someone about the opening to Bioshock Infinite.
I was like, I was saying to her, do you know the opening of Bioshock? And they were like, yeah, I know the opening. That's pretty famous.
I was like, ah, but do you know the opening of Bioshock Infinite, where they go into the lighthouse and then it fucking takes off into the sky and it's raining, but then it punches through the clouds and then suddenly the city is there. And I was like, I was getting excited about the game again, you know. So yeah, it's just quite an interesting one, isn't it?
Because it's got such a weird kind of like legacy to it, that game. So that kind of comes to mind. But yeah, I don't know otherwise.
It's more like the trapped element of it that makes me a bit concerned. You know, the under duress, you have to talk to this man feel of it. We just probably have a lot of game developers feel in general when they're being interviewed, but anyway.
Okay Matthew, next question then. This is from Gertrude. I do enjoy the drafts.
I think the format is excellent and doesn't need improvement. I was thinking it might be quite fun if, instead of voting for one of the participants, we cast a vote for each category. If there was an uneven number of categories, the voting would inevitably show a winner.
It wouldn't change the format of the game or the approach of the participant in any way. All it would serve to do is offer a greater insight into the opinion of the voter. More data equals more fun.
Unfortunately, or fortunately, we would have to sell for the possibility of a tied draft if it involved more than two participants. Yay or nay? What do you think of this, Matthew?
I think this is how most people come up with their draft vote anyway. I've definitely seen people show us lists where they've ticked each column and then they've said Matthew got six votes to sound as four and so I voted for him or vice versa. Occasionally someone will say even though one of you won more of the individual categories, these two games are just unmissables so this person wins by default.
So I don't know, it feels like it would just be quite a lot of work for the voters. I feel like people are doing this anyway if they want to. I also like the click, it's quite clean to just have one vote, one winner because we don't want to have like, I won the heart vote, he won the mind vote, you know, that feels like something that would get to what quite tires them.
Yeah, I think, I personally think that overcomplicating the draft is just not really the right way to do it, it's a proper like, you vote for it and then kind of damn it all, it's, you know, when I'm listening to other podcast drafts, you know, the one that we nicked it off, there's very much a kind of like, I don't really like those two picks and I will pick these picks. Like you say, you are totalling the ones that are valuable to you in your head. Even though I'm not necessarily doing a straight who won, it's more the exact combination might just tick the box, it doesn't have to be a compare each one.
Yeah. In a larger sense as well, I think there's quite a lot of clever clogs who listen to the podcast and a lot of people work in games, who are probably used to solving problems with data and information as opposed to pure gut vibes. That's like the thing, when you have no technical skills, vibes are all you've really got.
So I think that's why I'm pretty convinced it's the right way to do it is to just have that very simple vote one, two or three. What was interesting is when we talked about the drafts recently at a dinner, Matthew, you raised the possibility that Dave Scarborough and Ashley Day were too polite to take aim at your picks and you wondered if that was skewing the voting a little bit. Do you want to talk about that?
That's quite interesting little behind the scenes draft chatter.
Well, it's only because they're closer friends with you and you've known them a long time, they feel like they can be a bit spicy with you, Dave especially, and everyone goes quite gently on me. And I just seem to come through quite unscathed. And then I just wonder if I've been winning those four-person drafts because I haven't had people throwing shit at my picks constantly, where you have, you know, or you get dragged into that, that kind of whatever's going on with Dave, whatever his deal is, you get pulled into that.
And where I am like completely clean, you know.
Yeah, I don't know if that's why you're winning the draft. I think also some...
No, I'm winning because I picked the best games. I mean, that is...
Historically, you have won way more drafts than me. And I do wonder if, like, there's a little NGamer attachment element to a bit of our audience.
I have, like, provably, statistically provably, better taste.
Sure. I mean, I could encourage Dave to do a bit more taking shots at you, but it might just be weird because you just don't have that familiarity. You know what I mean?
Whereas...
I'll just be hurt.
Dave, well, that's it. Dave has, like, 14 years of history. Dave has 14 years of history with me.
It's like, imagine if, like, Rich Sandin came on and started making barbs about, like, you don't own a house yet, do you, Samuel? It'd just be a bit weird because I don't know Rich that well.
Right, right. I like that you think that's what Rich would come after you for.
Well, I don't know what else he'd go for.
Property ownership. Rich is so hot on that.
He'd go with chinless **** or something like that.
Don't say that.
Well, I'll beep it out. That's a bit more his vibe because he's got the old preacher avatar on social media. I feel like that's more of Rich's...
Things are different. Things sound different when you say them as a Scottish person as well.
Definitely. So I'll be beeping that out anyway.
It sounded so ugly when you said it and hateful.
Well, yeah. But I would never use it in everyday conversation. I don't think I've said that word in like 10 years.
It's been a long time. Wow. But I've said it for effect on this episode just to see how you react.
My only worry about asking people to go weapons-free. I don't know if you've ever seen this. There's a Saturday Night Live sketch where this guy wants to have like a roast, like a comedian's roast.
And he's like saying to his friends, like he's hired out a bar and he's like, why don't you come up and roast me and come on, like really go for me, really go for me. And like he just, and then the joke is he's incredibly thin skinned and everything everyone says completely sets him off and really upsets him. And he just can't take it at all.
And just because he likes watching roasts on YouTube, doesn't mean you necessarily want a load of people to say barbed things about you. I would imagine it would be a lot like that. I'd be like, give me your best shot.
And then the second Dave said anything, it just be like, well, that's me and this guy done forever.
Yeah, that's what I don't even mean. So in some ways it just, I mean, we did talk as well about is it to me skewed in terms of, it's all my ex-coworkers and none of your coworkers on the drafts. Like maybe that's maybe changing the energy a little bit.
I do think that Dave and Ash are excellent podcast guests and just really picked a different array of games to us. And it just really changes the energy of the podcast in a good way. But yeah, that's the one byproduct of it, I think, is that we have a familiarity as a trio that you are not really part of.
So you get to just cruise to victory on the side. They will like you and they will respect you, I think. But it's just that, you know, it's just not quite the same, is it?
It's like Tom Cruise standing next to the Three Stooges.
We have a few different episodes that we're sort of thinking about having Dave and Ash back on for, actually. So we talked about doing an all-star Japanese game developers draft. So like one developer or publisher per category as a thing.
So you can only pick one From Software game, one Capcom game, one Konami game, etc. So that's something we're thinking about doing. A first person draft we're thinking about doing as well.
I don't know if that would be a four-person one or not. We also thought about doing a years one where you take the last 10 years, and then you just got to pick one game from each year and it's four of us. That could be fun as well.
So these are all things we're thinking about because I think we're aware that probably the most obvious one to do next would be a DS redraft. But I'd like to do something a bit different. Is that how you feel about it as well, Matthew?
Yeah, I agree with that. I definitely want to do the Japanese studios one. I think that could be fun.
Yeah, that'll probably be the next one we do. Some point later this summer. I'm not sure when, but I think we're probably due to bring the drafts back in about July or August.
So yeah, stay tuned.
The later the better, because those edits are big.
There's a reason there's only one per financial quarter of this podcast, basically. Okay, next up then is from Lexington87.
You have a new position on the Battlestar Back Page. What is your desired position on the ship versus your actual position you would probably be assigned based on your skills and personality? Yeah, as you say, from Lexington87.
I believe this question is about Battlestar Galactica, right?
Yeah, it is. I think that Lexington is always like, watches like one five season TV show every two weeks, and then moves on to the next one. I think it's has done The Shield and Borgon, and always done Borgon has moved on to The Shield.
Oh, it's definitely into Borgon. Yeah, I love Battlestar Galactica, but I can't say I have such a good like, working knowledge of the hierarchy of that ship and what everyone does.
Oh, don't worry, I've already got this for us. You both of us, right, we're either Fat Liadama, when he's overweighting the start of season three, we're either him or Colonel Tye. Like both of us have big Colonel Tye energy, I would say.
Just sort of like slightly aggro-y, not in charge, loses an eye at one point. You know, like I just I think that's maybe a slightly more our vibe, Matthew.
Once important, over the hill, a bit embarrassing.
A little bit, yeah, but nonetheless, I think it's maybe a bit more our vibe. Fat Leah Dahmer I think is more our energy. There's a gif of like fat, it's like a really crude fat suit they put on Jamie Bamber, I think the actor is.
It's very like the fat Drake in Uncharted.
Yeah, very much late noughties fat-shaming vibes to it. And then like within one episode, I think he loses it and then one of the other, I think Halo, one of the other characters just says to him, hey, you're looking great now, man. And they just obviously took the fat suit off and that's all that happened.
So yeah, there you go. I'll be sure to include a gif of Fat Leah Dahmer with this episode, Matthew, in the linked in the plan. Next question then is from Sean Thomas.
Hi chaps, what have been the hardest secrets to keep over the years? Games under embargo for many months, leaks you aware of for three years, et cetera. What have you got, Matthew?
Well, I know very little and have known very little. In slightly irritating fashion, I'd say the juiciest things I've ever heard about and learnt about, you just can't say. Not because they're like secret games or terrible crimes, but some Nintendo games that delayed for sometimes bad reasons or not released.
I've never had anything a fun secret. I've never been able to be a Jeff Grubber-like and get all that cred by being able to leak what XYZ are up to. I've just sat on three gnarly bits of Nintendo history that no one wants to know about.
Tomorrow on Nintendo Live, Matthew, we'll see a headline that says, Matthew Castle reveals Mother 3 was not released in the UK for funny reason. Or something like that. We'll see that kind of thing.
That just isn't a story though, is it? Because it didn't say what the thing was or what the reason are. I would imagine they'd know exactly what they are and have the same reasons.
Yeah, that's probably true. Yeah, so I would say that I did over the years learn bits and pieces. So most recently, when I was working at Bethesda, I knew that Oblivion remaster was a thing.
And so that was interesting to sort of sit on that, because I knew they were going to release it the way they did. And obviously, it came out the way it did. And I think it was really cool the way they just rolled it out.
And it was just there. You could just play it, stop the game passing, etc. But the one I sat on for the longest was when I knew about The Last Guardian.
I think I knew about that two years before they revealed it, when it was called Project Trico. So, yeah, they'd shown the trailer to my boss in the office. I've definitely talked about this in the podcast before.
And then he told me about it. And then a Sony PR told me a bit more about it as well. And so back in the day, they would sometimes show you games years in advance.
Because they were like locking in covers and, you know, there was a lot of trust between editors and stuff. It was a bit more in the days before. Those kind of like leakers were like a big thing.
You know, it was a bit of a different age for this stuff. I think I heard that GTA V was set in LA in 2010 or 2009 before it was announced. And I'd heard that from a friend of a friend at Rockstar.
And I, but I didn't, I couldn't confirm it. And so I never really did anything with that information. I just sort of, you know, sat on it or whatever.
I think I was among the first to learn that Yakuza was being ported to PC for the first time. Again, again, like Sega just told me that as like, you know, you have trust with these publishers. But that's the thing, you know, I learned those bits of information because I'm strictly not a Jeff Grubber-like, you know, I'm not that kind of Jez Corden style person, Jeff Grubber-like.
Yeah, those are like, that's a slightly different sort of angle on these things and how they're rolled out and how they're learned about, I guess. These are just direct from the publishers with the understanding you're not going to leak them basically. So yeah, so I, yeah, those kind of come to mind.
There was also one that I heard about someone, I heard a story secondhand from someone who'd gone to an Activision studio years ago, saw something exciting. And then when I asked a person who was on the trip, who saw some of the art related to this or so I heard, that person had no memory of it or no knowledge of it. And so I never really knew if it was true or not.
So that's one of those things where I was like, for years I heard that X Studio was making a thing that people would be quite excited about. You know, if you knew what it was now, you'd be like, oh, that's like a bit of a non-event because of the way history played out or whatever. But it's, yeah, that kind of thing you do hear about every now and then.
Actually, thinking about it, when I went to see Red Steel 2, I think Ubisoft Paris were also working on what must have been quite an early version of Ghost Recon Wildlands, the first open world one they did.
That's right, yeah.
In the studio, you could just see another team playing something together, that you were like, what's that? What's that big open map? There seemed to be four military guys going about together, and it was a bit of a, oh yeah, don't look at that.
But normally those things are really well covered up when you go to studios. They don't even let you go in the same floor that you might see something interesting. Yeah, there was a bit of that.
But obviously, I was too excited about Red Steel 2, to possibly want to talk about that at the time.
Yeah, exactly, those are the ones that come to mind. There's probably some more I learned about over the years.
We knew about Punch Out quite a bit earlier, but I can't think how. Because NGamer, we didn't have regular meetings with Nintendo or anything. Maybe official Nintendo knew and told us.
But we knew about that to the point where we didn't accidentally announce it, but we were absolutely sure it was going to be E3 and then it wasn't. I think we mentioned it before we went to print before E3, and then just had to backpedal a bit in the next month's news section. Be like, turns out we were wrong about Punch Out.
Whoops.
That's funny. Yeah. I don't think I've had a situation quite like that.
I still know some things that are secret, but they're like under NDA or I've just like a friend told me, so I decided to just keep them secret because you do. I think the last Guardian one was genuinely interesting because think about how after Shadow of the Colossus, how anticipated that game would have been. Just to know anything about what the next Fumito Aida game is.
I mean, that's what I was hoping to see at SGF this year, because obviously they revealed the game at the end of last year. I wanted to see what that game was in more detail, but they didn't show it. I just had all these games that were like my Norse stars on Play Magazine, and for one reason or another, they all either turned out to be a bit flawed or didn't come out for years and years.
Project Trico or Last Guardian or Metal Gear Solid 4 or Final Fantasy 13, Kingdom Hearts 3, they're all variously plagued as Japanese game developers struggled with the HD generation of consoles variously. Not Kojima, but MGS4 was flawed in the same way. Anyway, okay Matthew, next question.
You want to read this one?
What tiny personal irritations have made you put a game down for good? The sort of things others were not bat an eyelid at, but you just couldn't let go.
Are you going to read the next one?
Oh no, there's an next one. Sorry. Yes, I wrote some answers in the middle of the question.
GTA 6 going the hyper-realistic route, do you see a future where the series goes back to the more cartoonish visuals of Vice City? Do you think that there would be an appetite for this or has the time passed, never to return? And bonus question, that's already a bonus question I'd argue.
Given the chance to do GTA in an art style of your choice, what would you pick? That's from Evil Doctor Porkchop.
I don't think GTA will ever go back to those cartoonish visuals for the simple reason of they were a by-product of the PS2's limitations. And they are still kind of cartoony, I think.
Yeah, I disagree with that at the heart of the question. It looks amazing, but it's a slight caricature of what people are like.
Yeah, it's hyper-realistic as something else. If you look at the original Watch Dogs, that was going for hyper-realism. That's what it looks like when you do nothing cartoony with your art direction and you end up with this quite greyscale-y kind of game.
Some people like that style, but I think that GTA does retain a bit of color, no matter what. They always have that as part of the art mix. So yeah, I agree with that as well.
Tiny personal irritations, Matthew. I drop games for all kinds of reasons. I just like a bit of busy work or the fact that I don't think that, or the fact there's loads and loads of eggs to collect in Animal Well and I can't be bothered to do that.
So I just turn it off after four hours. Those kind of come to mind. What about you?
Is there anything you pop out for this one?
Repetition in many different forms. You know, unskippable cutscenes, married to hard fights. Doesn't happen as much anymore, but used to be a big thing.
I really hate repeating journeys from a checkpoint to a very difficult boss. That's really why I just can't get into the souls like things. It's that bit, it's like, I can do all this.
There's nothing outside of the boss that can concern me. We all know I'm going to die in there. Just let me get there and do it that way.
Certain text pop-ups, menu screen transitions, if there's one too many layers of stats at the end of a JLPG fight or something. These little things, they just add up. That can be something that puts me off.
It's just like the, if I'm given enough time for my mind to wonder, you know, I'll leave that world and then I won't want to go back in. Something that really gets me in adventure games and visual novels is a variety of text box sins. So a game having like a bad, ugly or basic bitch font, I'm like, ugh, you know, you didn't put any more thought into it than this font, this is hard work, I don't want to look at this.
Yeah, bad fonts, like just naff text box design, if it doesn't look very like artfully designed or artfully placed, it just feels like, my eyes are gonna be looking at this thing a lot, I need to know, I mean, it's a safe pair of hands, an annoying sound effect, you know, for when text is unfolding, particularly if it's like a comedy sound effect, like if you don't have fully voiced characters, but you have like basically rare characters, you know, they're like that's that is just death to my ears, particularly now I'm like, I really don't like that aesthetic at all.
Oh, oh, yeah. That's why I've never finished Akami. There's just too many bullshit noises to get through Akami.
They are. It's a great game, but the noises, man, they're just, they're tough.
I'll tell you what, the real killer for me, though, is, and this is a bit rich after the Two Giant Ben. It's it's bad jokes. I really, I really hate jokes that miss the mark, games that think they're really funny and aren't like, I hate nerd humor.
I don't really want to have like lots of internet humor in my video games. Just makes them feel too close to what you see in everyday life. And it's, it's not very, it's not very interesting to me.
I hate, and again, this may sound a bit rich based on some of the stuff that happens on this podcast. I hate wackiness in stuff, in game characters. I almost bailed on Clare of Skull because I really hate those puppet creatures, that village of them.
Oh, yeah, I knew that. I always thought that was going to be an acquired taste when people got to it.
That is, that is, like, I think if you can get past that, there's nothing else too egregious in that game, but like just a village of wacky guys, all speaking slightly wacky voices. They've all got a wacky thing going on. This one's setting up a casino and this one, you know, can't find his hat or whatever.
I'm just like, this is like having to walk around there, see all their fucking text boxes, all those text box sins kicking in as well. That section to me was pure death. I was just like, what the fuck is this?
Like, I cannot believe people are into this.
Yeah, but that game needs a tone or break.
Yes, yes, that is true. And like you say, I persevered. Because it takes a lot to get me out.
There's not many games that I just absolutely walk away from. But yeah, those are the things, the joke things. When a game's only thing is comedy, like for example, Thank Goodness You're Here.
Like I gave up on that just because I just didn't find it funny and all it was trying to be was funny. So, that's like, yeah.
You got a good list of gaming sins there. I really like the one about text boxes and slot-bar fonts. Well, that's the number one reason I think I haven't finished all of the Final Fantasy games.
Like I've not, it's really hard to play FF9 on Switch when the text boxes look that bad.
Right.
It's beautiful looking game. The PS1 version has much better looking text. Why does this one have this really bad text?
I think that this is a lesson Scranix has finally learned with those pixel remasters, because they actually, after a fashion, releasing on PC and looking bad, they have patched in a nicer looking font for it, and they actually look very presentable, great definitive versions of the game. But it took them so many duff re-releases to learn that lesson, and so many duff ones are still on the market, and don't quite look right. And so, yeah, that's a good list there, Matthew.
I mean, like, if you ever read about the making of Ace Attorney, like, Shootakumi was, you know, programming the individual, or programming, choreographing the individual dialogue boxes, like, all himself by hand. So, like, if this one goes slightly faster because someone's a bit angry, or if this word is spelt out, boop, boop, boop, boop, because it's meant to be like, we're hanging on this word a little bit, you know. I thought that there was real kind of thought and intent behind those text boxes.
And I think if you're a game which is largely reliant on text, like, if you're not doing that, I just think you're instantly botching a huge, huge part of your game. And it's the thing I noticed the most when I'm playing, like, demos in, like, Steam Next Fest or something, is when you play something and it's a little bit far off and you go in and, like, the menu fonts are a bit bleak and you're like, it automatically puts me in a, oh no, this seems a bit careless. And maybe that seems incredibly petty and a small thing, but I think that stuff really fucking matters.
Like, I just want to know that I'm in a pair of hands that has considered the whole thing, but.
Did you play the helicopter game Cleared Hot on, in Steam Next Fest?
I haven't. Don't tell me, is it like some fucking Times New Roman monstrosity?
It's got bad fonts in the menus, for sure. And rough edges around, rough around the edges in presentation, but the actual in-game models and everything, and explosions and stuff, they all look great. It's a great looking game, I think, but those things make it seem cheaper than it actually is.
Yeah, so I kind of get you, because whereas you play something like Ball X-Pit, or Ball Pit, however you call it, or Minna, which Minna has obviously amazing, authentic Game Boy Color style fonts. You sort of feel the difference in not, professionalism is not the right word, but they've got the backing for the, they've got the time and money for the polish. You know what I mean?
That's the thing. Devolver wouldn't let that demo go out unless it looked presentable, because they're a major publisher. And those Yacht Club developers, they've made a monstrously successful game early in the, late in the Wii U lifespan, early in the Switch lifespan, they've made loads of money from that, they've taken their time to make this one right.
You know, clear and hot, it's just a bunch of guys making a cool helicopter game. It's okay for that game not to have the same level of polish with those kind of elements, but I did also want to know whether if you played that, you'd be so upset by the fonts you couldn't possibly get on with the game.
I know, I will obviously try and push through. I'm just saying, there's a sense of like, you're already on the back foot a little bit with me, and it's like, you're going to have to work extra hard. Look, I'm not going in neutral, I'm going in cross, because you've made me look at bad font.
I'm going in cross, that's good. Okay, next question then Matthew. Hi lads, working my way through the backlog at the moment and currently playing Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
After a short but enjoyable firefight in a nightclub, it got me wondering, what do you think is the best nightclub scene in a game? And a bonus question, what game character would you like to go clubbing with? Horny answers allowed in brackets.
That's from Adam Tonoku in the Discord. Nightclubs Matthew, a couple came to mind for me, but what have you got?
As you know, I'm a big connoisseur of real life nightclubs, so I obviously have a lot of great observations to make about this. The obvious one is Hitman 3 Berlin. Has to be in Mithershout.
I just think even though I don't have a lot of nightclub experience, I know there are some fundamental truths in that place, like the sound of the thing and the way the sound changes as you move through that building. To be outside a noisy building has such a specific energy to it and that's what that level really, really nails. I also like that it has different parts to it where different things are going on.
Like outside, there's like a kind of nervous anticipation of people queuing up to get in, then you have the heart of the thing where people are just like losing their minds, you know, on the dance floor, and then you have all these little kind of periphery areas where people are just kind of like recovering from that. And, you know, I've probably been in two actual nightclubs in my life, but I know that that is true of nightclubs, you know? That is how those places work.
They cannot just be one universal, loud room. There is so many shades of gray to them. I think that Berlin is just the best by a long way.
Yeah, that's a good suggestion. Hotline Miami came to mind. There's a great nightclub level in that where there's like a DJ and everything.
And like you can even from the limited visual palette they have, you can just tell it's a nightclub and the piece of music that plays in that nightclub is fucking amazing. So maybe I'll even cut that in here when you're listening to the podcast the little piece of music I'm talking about.
I also came to mind, apart from Hitman 3, which is the obvious answer, I really liked the ballad of Gay Tony, had a bit more in the way of nightclubs, because obviously Tony Prince in GTA, he was a nightclub owner, and so you have Luis, the main character, kind of going in, you could do dance mini games, and then there was even a dance-off in that game, which I thought was just a really nice touch. I can't remember if there was an achievement tied to it or not, but whatever nightclub that Friday night song was happening in, Matthew, in Yakuza, that's good.
Oh, is it Maharaja?
Something like that, or Club Sunshine? Or is that the other one that Dingy B Jigs in? I can't remember.
But yeah, so those come to mind, really. I guess that one in, not in Cyberpunk, is pretty good as well. There's never really much to interact with when you go in there.
So I did write this one down, but I wondered if, as long as it's the thing I'm thinking of, I thought it was more of a bar than a club, which was the afterlife.
Yeah, it's sort of borderline, isn't it?
But what I like about Afterlife is that it's full of all these sort of mercenary legends in their secret little booths. I like the sense of business being done and the kind of hushed or of like, these are really amazing celebrities who you're in awe of and let's just not bother them. Let's be classy and just leave everyone be.
I like that vibe in Afterlife.
Yeah, I think we've caught a lot of the main ones there. Oh wait, I don't know if that really counts actually. There's a club in Mass Effect 2, an Omega, that's a little bit...
Oh, is it Omega? Yeah, I think it is Omega and it's like... Is that the one that's owned by...
The lady played by Cariann Moss is there and the Asari is there and it's a bit more of a dive than a nightclub, I think. So that kind of comes to mind.
Is that one way you can do a bit of dancing on the...
It might be.
You can dance in a few places in those games.
Yeah, you can dance in each one of them, I think all of the entire trilogy.
I'm quite a big fan of like an Easter egg nightclub, like in Lego Star Wars where you find one with loads of like stormtroopers dancing to like a disco version of the Imperial March or something.
Or the Destiny one where they're dancing to Paul McCartney, Matthew.
Oh my god. I mean, if there was a nightclub that played Hope for the Future, I would absolutely... that would get me into going to the club.
If it was Hope for the Future night at Comedia, I'd be really up for that. I'd buy all the tickets.
Matthew would be going to the club. That's what he'd be doing. You've seen Megalopolis, haven't you, Matthew?
Did you watch that at the end? Yeah, but that...
I don't really remember that line.
It's like the only quotable line in it, I think. You go to the club.
No, the only quotable line is, Check out this boner I got.
Oh yeah, that's true, actually. Maybe there are many quotable lines there.
Said by the great John Voight.
Oh dear. Okay, next question. Matthew, do you want to read this one?
Yes. Dear Samuel and Matthew, I was reminded of how GTA V holds back on aircraft missions until a fair ways into the game, and how this helps it feel extra cool when the time finally comes to fly. Do you have any favourite game held back this moment moments in games?
Yours Blinky?
Flying is always the great thing to have in your back pocket. When San Andreas does it, it's a huge deal. When you get the jetpack, it's a huge deal.
When you first get in a helicopter in Vice City, it's very exciting. That's like always a rock star staple. And I understand that Red Dead Redemption 2 has its own version of this as well, Matthew.
Yeah, I mean, kinda.
Kinda. But also so does Mad Max, actually, is a bit where you're going to go up into the avalanche game with that. Those are the ones that really come to mind, or unlocking a new landmass.
When you find out there's like a whole extra area. I would say that probably the original Red Dead's version of this is when you get the you get out of Mexico and you get to the New Victoria, whatever it's called, the bits of the snowy mountains and the town. The bit you see in the opening credits and you're like, will I ever go back there?
And then you do finally go back there. And I understand that's in Red Dead Redemption 2 as well, Matthew.
Yeah, I'd say the end game of Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably a good example of this without spoiling it, for those who haven't played it. Someone's had jumped out at me getting the Paraglider and the Grappling Hook in Dying Light 2 is a really great moment. It comes about halfway through the game, so I think you've proven yourself as a master of on foot parkour and then all of a sudden you can really fling yourself around that city and the introduction of definitely the Grappling Hook comes with when you ascend the skyscrapers of the financial district, which obviously you've seen from afar throughout the game, but it's a great bit of like, this tool is going to completely change how this city behaves, so we're going to hold back on it, but we're also going to really deliver the moment it arrives and we're going to send you to like the highest point in the city.
That's absolutely brilliant. It's probably the best moment in that game by far. A quieter one, but one that I…
The couple of times I've played it, I've really liked it both times, is when you get the silent pistol at the end of Tomb Raider Reboot.
Oh right, that's cool.
Because up until when, you know, there's been that stealth element, but it's that kind, you know, it's sort of bow and arrow and it's a little bit kind of not messy or unpredictable, but it's not as quick and efficient as having a really cool silent pistol and you suddenly become like this incredible kind of predator in that environment and I feel like something shifts there and I think you only get it in like the last fifth of the game or something. There's like a scene in a forest where everyone's looking for you with flashlights and all of a sudden you're just like sniping people in the head and I guess they needed to have it later in the game because if you start that game off getting upset about like one person dying you can't then skip to like ten headshots in a row feeling fucking awesome, which they do. And a little Tears of the Kingdom one.
I think when you finally get the kind of steering stick or column Zonai device, which is like the basic the driving stick that you can stick on vehicles and then begin to drive them like manually rather than just relying on them like rolling down hills, you know, if you stick it onto a glider, the glider becomes more of a plane in the way that you drive it. Like that's quite transformative. In terms of your Tears of the Kingdom tech tree, that's like a big jump for Link because all of a sudden you have like total command of your devices.
And you know, it can come at different times based on when you find one of these things, which is quite cool. You could feasibly play the game for 20 hours and not get it and then suddenly feel like a rush of innovation. So, yeah, another reason why it's one of the greatest of all time as we both agree on this podcast.
That has prompted a few memories of a few other ones, actually Matthew. So I forgot that in Saints Row 4, they have the Men in Black gun as like an Easter egg. It's got a similar name to it.
It's called like the Noisy Cricket in Men in Black. It's called the Loud Locust in Saints Row 4. So they riffed on that.
That's quite fun. I also thought about how Final Fantasy games use the airships. For those kind of big moments as well.
So the Ragnarok in A is probably the best one because you go into outer space to get it. And then when you finally get it, I think like maybe beforehand you read a rumor or you read about a ship that went missing. Like it's just sort of like it's flowing out there in orbit somewhere.
And then you and Rinoa are flowing through space. You just suddenly, I think it's like a CG cut scene that plays and you just see this big old red spaceship flying over you. And it's one of the best ship designs in the series.
It looks like a proper sort of like a starfighter or something. It's a really cool looking thing. And so when you take that back to the planet, and all you've ever had before that, is your very slow moving floating school.
And I think like a little car that you get that has no petrol in it, basically. You suddenly have a spaceship. That's a very much a cool leveling up moment.
So yeah, airships come to mind in Final Fantasy games. The other one I thought of was there's a moment in Jedi Fallen Order where you unlock the double lightsaber. And that's a really cool moment as well.
Because you feel like you have so little power in that game, because you're like a Jedi apprentice, basically. You're just trying to make your way through this. It's really this, I think this is this moment of empowerment when you really feel like you need it as part of the narrative.
And so you go into this little cave, I think you go into this little cave and forge it. It's been a long time since I played the game. And then suddenly you have this double lightsaber and it's a thing that I managed to like save as a secret for the game.
I thought that was awesome back when Star Wars could still delight me. So yeah, some good ones there Matthew. I felt like a rich selection.
So next question then. This is from Slayer Disco. Hello gents, I know you're fans of the Big Picture Podcast too.
Well, gave it away. Have you considered taking inspiration from their sister podcast, The Rewatchables and gathering a few friends of the pod to replay a short older game? Then go through a bunch of categories.
I for one would highly enjoy it. It could be a good opportunity to go back and hit some of the truly retro stuff from SNES and earlier. Keep up the good work.
What do you think Matthew? Rewatchables? I think there's a bit of Rewatchables energy in the…
when we do alternative awards. I think that's very Rewatchables coded.
Yeah, there's a little bit of it. I like those categories. When we do a deep dive, Two Giant Men play X, Y, Z.
So I think we have discussed this. Every once in a while we will kind of lament that we can't do a Rewatchables style between us anyway. I know other video game podcasts, should they exist, do like a weekly dive into one particular game.
But they often do it with a rotating, again, if they were to exist, they would do it with a rotating pool of hosts, which is really the only way to do it. When you are as vain as us and insist that all Backpage related podcasts have both of us in them, it's just not doable. Like the amount of work that goes into...
You know, like when we did Vice City or whatever, and you're like... You know, you're playing that game for like 20 hours, for two hours of podcasts, and I don't mind doing it. Like it was fun and I'm really pleased with those episodes, and they often are some of our best episodes, but...
They're really good. They're really good. It's just not feasible.
I mean, if a billionaire wants to invest in this podcast, so it means Samuel don't have to work day jobs, we will absolutely do a weekly rewatchables for you. We will do a replayables, whatever you want to call it. That can just be a thing that happens, but it really requires a millionaire to come out the woodwork.
It does. It's just too hard otherwise. I mean, we're doing...
It's even hard to logistically manage the ones we're already doing. So for example, this month we can no longer get Jeremy Peel on the Indiana Jones one we're doing, because Jeremy's away for eight days before we record the episode, and I haven't finished it yet, and we didn't know that before we scheduled the episode. And then it's like, that means that scheduling has basically defeated that episode that we wanted to do, which basically was a replayable style thing about a game that a lot of people have played and will have some thoughts on, so it would have been a good little episode.
So yeah, it's logistically hard to do that. And also I think there is value in it always being the people... I mean, people listen to podcasts for us.
If it was a rotating selection, it just wouldn't be the podcast. I think people want to hear our viewpoints and how we contrast and how we talk about things. So yeah, it's really a bind.
It really has to be a full-time job. So that billionaire, if you're out there, we'll do it. We'll get a little office and bath and we'll just play a computer game.
We'll play like one computer game a week and make a podcast about it, all for you. And also the other listeners.
But if they don't come out the woodwork, that's fine. We will still do Two Giant Men play the occasional game. It's just not as often as we'd maybe like.
No, that's it. But yeah, we do about maybe four or five a year at the moment, but I'd love to do more frequently because Metro Prime, Vice City, really fun to do. Even Beyond Good and Evil, which is easily the worst of all the games we've done that format with, that was still good fun to do, Matthew.
So hopefully. The categories thing. I do like the categories a lot in that podcast, like the Dion Waiters and all that stuff.
You name literally the award, I don't understand.
Well, I get it because it's a bit like, it's like someone who will be a video games version of Dion Waiters, a character comes in and like basically steals the show, then fucks off again. That's basically what Dion Waiters is, is someone who comes in and like does the most with the least amount of screen time. It'd be someone like fucking Awaka the 23rd in Final Fantasy X or something, like just like a store keep who really sticks in your brain or something.
It'd be that level of character. Yeah. So yeah, I do enjoy all those awards, but yeah, the films are much easier to do a weekly podcast about the video games.
It's just the reality of it. You know, I don't want to be doing these things about like a short hike, an Echo Junior, just games that are like two hours long. You know, I just don't think it's going to work.
OK, Matthew, you're going to read out this next one.
Hideo Kojima reportedly has a mind tomb, a USB full of his ideas in case he meets an untimely demise. What would one find in the lad's mind tomb? Unwritten novels, abandoned screenplays, unrealised episodes ideas?
That's from Koig.
Oh god, yeah, there's so many discarded Google Docs with like really naff novel ideas in them for me. But I don't want those to go in a tomb. I want those to be like formatted when I die.
That would be in my will basically. Please, hear all my login details. Please go on and delete every Google Doc that's in my drive.
Yeah, I don't think it's any like gold will be in there. And no offence to Kojima, but I don't think his will have any gold in there either. Is that too harsh, Matthew?
What do you think?
Yeah, I mean, I kind of get it. I mean, he's yeah, I thought that was one of the more baffling like news stories. You know, just the idea of like, I have all these great ideas and the idea that they wouldn't be a new creative powerhouse to have new original ideas or that all the people who work under him like when he dies would just be like not know what to do with themselves.
Like I'm sure they've got ideas of their own and would splinter off and work on those. I'm not sure that, you know, they're not all just like that sad dog turning up at his master's grave forevermore. Yeah, but like it's quite a classic kind of Kojima re-quote isn't it?
Incidentally on Kojima, did you read Sam White's GQ interview with him? Yeah. I really, I thought it was great.
I really enjoyed it. The letterbox bit in particular. I thought he gave off powerful divorced energy in that interview.
Yeah I can see that. He's never been less media trained than he is now, you know what I mean? I think he's like properly going out there and just saying anything.
Yeah. What gave it away for you Matthew?
There was something about, he doesn't talk about his family that often. He was talking about watching films with his sons, but he was like, now my sons are grown, I've got no distractions from all my work. I was like, if you are married and if you still have a wife, it doesn't sound hugely fun for her.
He's like, I'm completely motivated by work and I'll stay in the office all the time because I deserve to see no reason to be anywhere else. I was like, if I talked about work like that, Catherine would be furious.
My guess is he's divorced, but we just never heard about it.
Because it's not cool in a tweet.
Well, it's more just like private, I guess.
Yes, or that. But he's such a, yeah, but yeah, I'm more reasonably bad.
Or a bad tweet, Matthew. Or a bad tweet, like you say.
Well, I don't know. I just, yeah, actually, it might a lot make sense. Yeah.
Yeah.
I take it back.
I'm not judging him. I'm not saying like, oh, he's divorced and because of that, he sucks, you know?
Well, no, I get it because there's a fine line of like, he's always, he gets a bit of this tension that even on a silly podcast like this, where it's like, how much of your real self do you put into the thing versus whatever? And there's a lot of what Kojima likes in his life out there in the world, you know? But, you know, have you ever, when he goes to see like Venom, The Last Dance or whatever, do you ever see a picture of his wife next to him or is he by himself?
Maybe he's just been like very carefully angling his phone all this time. I don't know what's going on.
Could be, could be.
I mean, maybe this is just sort of the cult of personality and us being like parasocial with these developers who make the games we like. But you know, there is a natural curiosity, you know, in like what drives them and their general lives. So I'll always remember when I had a steak with Harada of tech and fame, he was, we were talking about, not like gossiping about other developers.
Like he was quite a discreet guy. He obviously knew he was sitting with some journalists, so he wasn't just going to like spill the beans. But he did say something about like Suda 51 driving an incredibly sensible family car.
And it just made me laugh because his whole persona is like, I'm the wild man. I love tits and violence. Yeah.
But then the truth is he goes home and he's got a family and he's like quite a rational dude drives a sensible car. Like, I don't know, that kind of enriches my understanding of like him and his games. I do like that stuff.
I am quite nosy about that. That's why I just thought that that interview with Kojima was a bit more, I think he revealed a bit more of himself than he usually does. And, you know, the negative reading of it, I was actually surprised.
You know, it was probably intended as total commitment to work, but it came across as, I actually thought it was a little bit sad. That, like, I live only for this, this craft.
But, yeah, but he's, he's like right near the end of a six-year project. Like he's, yeah, I don't think anyone would feel that way. You know what I mean?
It's such a mounting point.
That's probably true.
Especially when you're in your late 50s, or is he early 60s? I can't remember.
Yeah, I can't remember. But, yeah, anyway, good interview, which was...
Sam's very good at disarming people, I think. He's like, that's one of his strengths, even as someone who is just Sam's friend, but going out for dinner with him and stuff. Like, the way he chats to you is good at inviting you to talk about yourself in a very, kind of, comfortable way.
I could see why someone... I could see why Kishy would offer up what he did in that interview as a result of that. So anyway, it's a good piece, Matthew.
That's all I'm saying. Yeah, it's a good piece.
What's in your tomb?
Well, that was me showboating, trying to distract from the fact that I don't really have anything interesting in my mind, too. I've got the same thing you've got. I've got five pages of various sitcoms that I try to write till I enter comedy writing prizes and BBC applications, but never finish, because I'm a lazy shit.
I've got like paragraphs, opening paragraphs, and numerous books. I've got some horrible snippets of screenplays from like film school applications. It's in a tomb for a reason, you know?
It's like a trapped Indiana Jones tomb. It's like, you must not come in here and see all this sadness.
Yeah, the furthest down the road I got was something. I don't mind sharing the idea, because it's like, who cares? But I did write a whole synopsis of a book about a sort of like, it was going to be about a video game kind of like luminary, like a fictional one.
And it was kind of about this sort of thing I have noticed every now and then over the years of like guys who sort of like are surrounded by like young women, and want to be admired by them, but aren't sort of like salacious or sexually into them, but want to be sort of like beloved by them in this very specific way. And it was a story about that from the perspective of like someone he hired, who basically gets chewed up in the machinery of this dude and his big idea, stupid video games. And I even spoke to like a couple of game developer colleagues about like credible game design things that might plug into the story.
And it was going to have like a big like COVID bit in the middle of it as well. I got really far down the line with it. And then that Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow book came out and I thought, ah, they've kind of done it now, they've got there, you know what I mean?
I was going to say, I thought you were beaten to the punch by HBO's The Idol. But that's what you were writing basically. Except instead of a pop singer, he's making an FPS.
And I did, and the character was just called Lily Rose Depp. That was like part of the text.
I was watching The Idol going, God damn, killer idea.
What a great show. What an underrated show. Do you keep seeing that clip of The Weeknd doing the rounds, where he's going, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. From his terrible film, where it was called Edge of Never Hurry Tomorrow, or something like that is called. It's got a fucking stupid name.
Hurry up tomorrow, isn't it?
That's it. Edge of Never Hurry Up Tomorrow is not correct, I will admit. Have you seen that clip doing the rounds?
It's the most embarrassing thing. You're like, this guy is such a talented musician, but he shouldn't be anywhere near the big screen or doing any acting. Anyway, I'll send you the clip, Matthew.
It will make you laugh. So, yes.
Something that is in my mind vault to bum everyone out for the years to come is all my failed video applications to get on the traitors. Now, that is cursed.
Yeah. Oh, gosh. I really wish for your sake that you could go on there, because some of the fucking normies they've got on there.
It's sort of like, I just know you'd be a good... You'd be good in the mix, you know what I mean?
It would be transformative for this podcast, Listening Numbers.
It would, at least like a month, and then it would probably drop off a bit.
No, I think people would be into it, as long as it didn't get voted out in the first episode after I like accidentally fell in the lake or something.
Yeah, or like you're the one who notoriously falls on Claudia Winkleman and crushes her or something, like by accident. That's the sort of thing that could also happen, you know, a worst-case scenario.
I get tapped on the shoulder and made a traitor. My face goes instantly beetroot red. And then everyone's like, well, it's that guy.
It's that guy with the big red face, the worst lier I've ever seen. It's like Gold Case from 30 Rock. It's like obviously that person visibly struggling.
Gold Case. What a great reference. OK, I think that's enough on the on the Mind Vault, or whatever it's called, Matthew.
We can move on from that one. Maybe we should pick one of the best ones and end on that. Should we end on the episode format ones from Nige?
What's the one you've got the most?
My notes dry up. I must admit, I kind of got about halfway through this and stopped doing notes.
Well, I'm the same. So we probably just ran out of steam at the same time. OK, well, I'll read this one out anyway, because I think it's about the podcast.
It might be kind of fun.
Oh, weirdly, I made notes on the Twitch YouTube one.
Did you make notes on the sandwich game one?
No, because I just saw the word sandwich and thought I can't. I just can't right now.
I know what you mean.
It's a nice question, but I get it. But I was like, oh, I just haven't really got a sandwich bit in me today.
Yeah. What about the subcategory of sauce, juice and gravy? Have you got one for that?
No.
In which case then, we're going to mulligan those. That's the right term, isn't it? Let's come back to it.
Let's definitely include it. Yeah.
Okay. Last question then. Dear normal men, innocent men, are there any back page pod episode format ideas you come up with which you secretly think would slap but which you can't or won't bring yourselves to do or which one of you has vetoed?
I'm related. I submit my unworkable suggestion. The cursed game box art draft in which you have to not only pick a winning selection, but also describe the art out loud to the listers.
Categories could include most egregious disparity with in-game visuals, too horny brackets 90s, too horny brackets 2000s, the X award for a disastrous rebrand, bad game such good art, good game such bad art, or the Blinks award for a juiceless mascot debut. This idea brought to you by an unfortunate Google search for Gauntlet Dark Legacy. Many thanks for a juicy podcast swimming in source.
Nige, I feel like I make you do most of the podcasts that we come up with Matthew, and then you sort of like less so these days, but sigh, rub your forehead and then sort of do them anyway. Are there any we've like completely just gone, no. Actually, no, we can't do that one.
Or that's just too hard. I really come to mind. Maybe a few drafts that we ended up not doing because we weren't totally convinced we could do them.
Are there any kind of borderline drafts that almost got there but we didn't quite? Game Boy is the one that's like forever a limbo, isn't it?
No, every year there is a conversation before Christmas about a Christmas episode. I think we have settled on quite good format now because we do the house party where people ding dong and come in. We've done that for two years now and I'm quite fond of it.
But before we had that, there would always be a moment in November where maybe a few Christmas ideas would go back and forth and you'd be like, I'm not really feeling any of these. I used to love doing the Christmas issues of NGamer and we'd make them really Christmasy, like put snow on every page, all this kind of stuff. I think I'm into gimmicky Christmas stuff, maybe a little bit more than you are.
But I also haven't got enough good audio ideas to make a whole episode of bits. So I think what we've come to in terms of the guests turning up, that just works a bit better, I think.
It took a bit of time. Yeah, I agree with that. I like the Christmas format as well.
I think it's the first year I think we were still figuring out when we were doing it. But this year, last year, I thought, that's really confident and I really like that. So yeah, I'm looking forward to doing that again this year.
We're assuming we don't take December off Matthew as we've threatened to do. We'll see how we feel when we get to December. So Game Boy Draft comes to mind.
I sort of get what you mean by Christmas, but the Game of the Year episode is the Christmas episode in some ways. It gives you a lot of what you want to hear at that time of year. A lot of interview episodes haven't quite happened, that sort of thing.
But episode formats, I'm not sure. The one I'm thinking is a bit shaky is the quiz format that we do. After doing a few of those, I'm not sure that's got a future in it.
What do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, if I had every single one of these magazines to hand, it would be much better. Instead, you're just constantly scraping through all these PDFs and all this online. It's just a bit of a pain in the arse.
Also, the particular era of magazines I grew up reading, when I go back to them, I still enjoy a lot of them and find them funny, but there's a lot of stuff. It just comes from a different time and it sometimes just sounds a bit rank and I don't want to be like, look at what these unrefined people did in the 90s or whatever, which you can easily do with some of those mags. So that's part of it.
Yeah. The other episode that we kind of, we kicked the can down the road on is, we're well aware we've still haven't done like a Kojima Hall of Fame or Draft episode. And we've talked about it, but we just, I think we both believe we have to play Snatcher and Police Nauts before we do that.
Is that the holdup on that one Matthew?
Basically, yeah.
Yeah. Those aren't long games, but it's still, we're obviously, we're always talking about other new games that come out of the podcast. So the Snatcher weekend has not occurred yet.
And it lost that, yeah.
I think there's some episodes which are just too good an idea to like rush or do a half-assed version of it. And I know that if I was listening to certain things, you know, it'd be like doing a Shootakumi episode and then you haven't played Ghost Trick. I'd be annoyed by that to hear it.
And I don't want to annoy people, so.
Yeah. So that's the thing is the bottleneck is always, it's mostly like the actual time that we can put into the podcast as opposed to the actual like the content of the podcast itself. It's been a long time since I came up with an episode format really.
But the ones that have taken the most time to figure out are, you know, episode 200 took a bit of a run up, like, you know, about 10 months, I think, in total of planning for that one. Most of it in the actual writing process. And then one night of me shouting, less rightily, less readily at Matthew.
But I've already got the idea for episode 300, Matthew, haven't I? We've talked about it. I think that's a good one.
I think people will really like that. And I don't have to record it for over a year yet. So that's good.
But yeah, I don't know. Like, we kind of, I think we've got enough formats that we can kind of keep cycling them and not worry about being too repetitive. If it gets to the point where I feel like we've exhausted all the different years for those episodes, maybe at that point I'll look into another episode format.
And I thought about bringing back one of our MAG ones, like the MAGCAB covers one, for example. I thought about bringing back one of our earliest formats on Game Review scores we got wrong, but getting a guest to come on and talk about their regrets.
Oh, that's quite good, yeah.
I thought about asking Chris Schilling for that one, but it's also weird to be like, hey.
Chris doesn't get Game Reviews wrong.
Well, I thought about it. That's the thing is, I'm asking, hey, have you ever shat the bed with a review? Would you like us to come talk about it on this podcast to make 40 pounds?
He's reviewed so many games. He must deep down think, yeah, I shit the bed on like 10% of these.
Well, it sounds like you're quite into it then. So that's good. If you've been on the podcast before and you want to talk about Game Reviews scores, you've got wrong.
Just drop me a message.
You've got to have some howlers, though.
Yeah, it's got to be good conversation starters. That's the kind of the criteria, really. And yeah, those come to mind, but nothing more specific, really.
I will keep thinking about ways we can do new things with the podcast, but I don't know. We've got enough containers, I think, to keep us ticking over for now, Matthew. And so with that absolute non-starter of an answer, the podcast comes to a close.
I say, though, don't blame us for a lack of new ideas. Blame the big picture.
OK, the podcast is over, Matthew. Where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrPazzlePesto on Blue Sky.
And I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. And the podcast is at BackpagePod on Twitter.
At Blue Sky, we update things on both. patreon.com/backpagepod if you like to support us and get two additional podcasts a month, including the games that we're the most excited about, top 10 lists that me and Matthew just did off the back of Summer Jeff Fest and Steve Next Fest a little bit as well. So that's around.
A good little story about going up to see Lesley Benzie's new lot.
Yeah, that was in the context of how that game's got a 1 out of 5 on Eurogamer and a 4 out of 10 on IGN. Might be an interesting story for those intrigued about the behind the scenes of games journalism. So yep, that's around.
And yeah, that's it. Next week, Matthew, we're doing Two Giant Men, sadly minus one other giant man, play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. So look forward to that.
Let's get out of here. Goodbye. Goodbye.
