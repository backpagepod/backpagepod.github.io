Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello Matthew. We are a returning special guest this week. It's Lucy Blundell, developer of One Night Stand and Video Verse. Lucy last appeared on the podcast in 2022. for our vest uh best uh not vest uh that's it's going well so far best visual novels episode um crikey that's a long time i mean i remember listening back to that episode when i was walking to um the worst train station in the UK, which is Cambridge North Train Station, which is basically like it looks like Fallout DLC out there. It's just really kind of like um there's like nothing for miles and miles. But distinctly remember you both talking about a PS2 visual novel that had been there that had a fan translation and or no, maybe it'd just been released on PC recently and Matthew is playing it and I have a distinct memory. of listening to that bit of the conversation while buying like a cake at the um the co at the Costa that's inside Cambridge North train station. So That's how long it's been. All of that is to say, hello Lucy, welcome back. How you doing?

Lucy
01:26
Hi, I'm I'm great, thanks. I think the game was ever 17, I think.

Samuel
01:32
Nice. I knew if I just put that DOTL out there that you'd um one of you would remember what it was.

Matthew
01:36
But Yeah, it sounds like since had a a re-release. It's been so long they've managed to re-release an obscure game that we talked about on that episode.

Samuel
01:45
Yeah, so it's uh it's great to have you back. Now you've done two episode appearances, you will make it onto uh the the Smash Bros. uh roster of the backpage when they make that beat em up eventually. So um congratulations. Um you recently launched Videoverse on PlayStation, Switch and Xbox around two years after the original PC launch in 2023. Um as a developer who mostly works solo, though not completely, what's the process of porting a game like when uh you you're going from PC to console like that? What challenges does it present to you?

Lucy
02:17
It really depends on like which engine you're using. So I use uh for my games Visual Novel Developer use RemPy. And RemPy doesn't like really port very well to consoles. Which is why I work with Rattelaker Games who do all the heavy lifting with that. um which makes my life a lot easier, but I still need to like get the kind of button controls correct. So it was the same with like porting one night stand with Videoverse like the interface is quite there's there's a lot of buttons. Um there's a lot of different screens and trying to get those buttons to like focus properly with a controller that was like the hardest thing and I'm still not 100% sure if we like figured it out. But I don't like I'm not really like a huge fan of, you know, like on-screen cursors for PC ports and things. We do have the on-screen cursor, so there is that option. But you can switch it on and off with um like the left stick. Uh but yeah, like it's that it's that part of it for me, like s getting the controller working is the hardest thing. We also added Japanese language um for like a new audience, uh but video versus it w it was a difficult game to localize because there's a lot of internet humor from like, you know, the early two thousands. Especially from like Europe and the UK. Things like, you know, there's a lot of Simpson memes, uh, Weeble and Bob, that kind of thing. Um so yeah, like trying to translate these things over to Japan was also really challenging.

Samuel
04:03
Yeah, I I read um an interview where you talked a bit about this. So am I right in thinking that to localize it in Japan they tweaked some of the cultural references to be more specific to that audience.

Lucy
04:12
Yeah, so we tried. The origin the original kind of translation was very literal and Some of the like early playtesting in Japanese was like this is quite a literal translation, and some of these things don't really make sense. So that was like a big concern for me. So it was just I really like relied heavily on my friends that speak Japanese who took like their precious free time to like help uh improve the localization basically. Um and that's what I was doing like earlier this year was just like trying to get this uh localization as good as it could be. And yeah, they like started adding like different game references that would make sense. I remember there's like a hotel dusk reference in Videoverse. I don't know if you guys can remember the meme that's like when you pick up a paperclip.

Matthew
05:09
Oh yeah, yeah.

Lucy
05:10
Yeah. So I was like trying to find uh like DS footage in Japanese to like find the exact wording of that specific part of the game to to put in video verse. To try and get it um so the Japanese audience would understand it Uh so yeah, I think we got there in the end, but it was a lot of work.

Samuel
05:32
That is so thorough.

Lucy
05:33
Yeah.

Samuel
05:34
That's really cool. It actually just occurred to me that maybe I should recap what Videoverse is, because it has been three years since you came on the podcast. I think a A bunch of our listeners went and checked it out when it released, um, because Matthew talked about it on on an episode um way back when. But um I will just read out the uh the s actually what you know what, I have the developer here. A Why don't you just uh tell us what we are best about? Well no, it's uh it's because It's because I opened the um store pages to check the price and encourage people to buy it and then I was just I was just like getting ready to read it, but that is preposterous.

Lucy
06:07
Please take it away Lucy. So Videaverse is a narrative adventure game. which is my love letter to video games. So it's set on like a miverse MSN Messenger kind of inspired gaming social network. And you talk to lots of different people on there, you make friends, there's a lot of old internet references, um, but it's kind of goes beyond being like an internet simulator and becomes a bit more of an emotional story about friendship and love and like teenage like awkwardness. Um and yeah, that's that's pretty much it.

Samuel
06:47
Yeah, and it's I I feel like the the people are in the age bracket that listen to this podcast will just find a lot of the the sort of references and tone of it spot on. It'll feel like something very familiar to you.

Lucy
06:59
Yeah.

Samuel
06:59
And it's uh around ten pounds basically on all formats.

Lucy
07:03
Yeah, pretty much.

Samuel
07:04
Yeah. Um so yeah, available now. Um Matthew, you're gonna we're gonna jump in then and add some more context.

Matthew
07:11
The thing it really reminded me of after the fact was like it's almost like a a much kind of kinder good vibes hypnospace outlaw in that the way it sort of simulates this this kind of community so completely. And there is a little bit of sort of sort of like detective work almost the way you kind of dig through it and you can kind of like nose into what different people have said about different subjects and whatnot. It kind of felt like that in i in a very successful capturing of a yeah, of a of a time and place, but uh like sort of good vibes only, just r a really positive thing. I really loved it. Um I'm sure I've told you this since, but uh as someone who did love Meiverse back in the day, I th I thought you just You just really nailed the the tone and flow of that place.

Lucy
08:00
Oh, thank you. Yeah. It it's very much because I'm like a little bit older than some of the, you know, meaver's um you know, the general age of the people using it. Um there are like older internet references in there as well. A little bit more inspired by my time on like message boards, forums for like Final Fantasy, for example, and then like MSM Messenger in my space also being a bit of an influence. It's like this weird mishmash of things that kind of made it its own. Um but the but Meverse was like definitely the you know original inspiration for the thing because when Nintendo closed it down, I think it was in 2017. I just thought it was really brutal. Because it was just there one day and then gone the next.

Matthew
08:51
Do you think they've got it somewhere? Do you think they've got it all stored somewhere and they they can go in themselves and have a little kind of wistful sigh at it? On a USB stick. Yeah.

Lucy
08:59
They I I probably think they do. I mean I actually used um I don't know if you've heard of Archiveverse, but it is the website that has all of like Meverse on it. So there's all the posts on there. Oh wow. And it's it's it's a website. And that was a that was a fantastic reference whilst I was making the game to try and remember like what were people posting about. So it was really cool. You you can go on there and you can like search by date. So you could find like a Nintendo game that released on a certain day and then go find what people were posting about on that day. It's really it's really cool. You can lose an afternoon to it.

Samuel
09:39
Yeah. Damn. Go check out what the Star Fox Zero secos were saying after I was curious because Obviously you can reach players on Nintendo consoles now. What has the response been like from from console players? Have you have you also had like a continued reception from people who have like gradually discovered the game on Steam in the in the years since it released?

Lucy
09:57
Um Honestly, it's actually been quite quiet, um, this console launch, which is a little bit uh a little bit worrying, but there's also been a lot of indie games launched in the last like couple of months. So I it seems like it's being a bit more popular on Switch compared to PlayStation and Xbox. Um I did have a bit of a rocky start, unfortunately. Though we we found like a bug um right at the end of the game. And it wasn't luckily it wasn't on Switch, but it was on PlayStation and Xbox. So it was just a bit of a like a shaky like weekend after it launched, like just scrambling trying to fix this thing And luckily we we sorted it really quickly, but it did kind of knock the wind out of my sails a bit. But this is uh this is sometimes just how it goes, you know. Um But the good news is like I think the Switch version is like the best way to play it and that one was unaffected. Tried it since on Switch 2, because I don't have a Switch 2 dev kit. uh but it runs really nicely on there, so that's good. Yeah. I'm just hope hoping it will be a slow burn, you know.

Matthew
11:11
If you like this podcast, you will definitely like this game and the period of time it's tapping into.

Samuel
11:17
It is quite backpage coded, isn't it?

Lucy
11:21
put an Easter egg of you guys in the Oh my god.

Samuel
11:24
I mean well I would have been I suppose we should say thank you for rendering us um you know as as you did. And uh yes, it was um it was a really nice surprise to mark our fifth anniversary is commissioned by Kim, uh Beatamax Bandit, our um our moderator in the Discord, um who's had to read all manner of horrible takes over the years that the Discord's been running and um the occasional good take as well. But uh yeah, uh how did that Come about actually, because I didn't really know much about that, but Kim was like, here it is, and it was a really nice surprise.

Lucy
11:54
Yeah. So I was asked by Kim. She approached me, she's like Uh I'd really love to celebrate the five years of the podcast. Would you do a video verse style uh illustration of you both that's in the style of the um your backpage logo. And I'm like, well, you can only really see their lips in in their logo. They're very close. Um I'd like I'm gonna have to like zoom it out so you can like tell that it's them. And you know, sh Kim is like really, really sweet about it. She's like, oh, you can take as long as you want. Like it doesn't have to be in time for the anniversary or anything. Um because she knew like I was launching video verse on console at the same time and I was like, I don't know if I'll have time, but I'll see what I can do. Anyway, it ended up being so much fun. Like it totally got my mind off like launching the console and helped me like relax and laugh, you know, like I really enjoyed doing it. So I thanks I thank him so much. It was really nice to do it. Um I just hope you guys liked it as well. Yeah.

Matthew
13:02
Who was harder to render in video verse style?

Lucy
13:05
It was actually you, Matthew. I it I was asking Kim like, do you have any like good reference pictures like of both of them side on so I can tell what their profiles look like? Um we were struggling to find a picture of you like from the side.

Samuel
13:22
So it's cause I never allow it 'cause of the whole jowl situation. Oh, it's funny because I think you captured The girth of my neck and the patheticness of my chin perfectly. Like I just I felt very seen by that picture. I thought you did a great job. No, it's just spot on. It's right it's right there under the surface. So I'm like, yeah, that's that's reality right there. That's a piece of art that's that reflects truth. I uh I appreciate it. Um yeah it was really nice. So um thank you for that. I will post that in the um Patreon post that goes along with this um episode along with a link to um get video verse on different platforms if you want to go check the game out. So uh Yes, um you've talked a bit about your next project, Lucy. And this was again in the interview that you um that you shared quite recently. I think it might have been with uh Japanese indie games website or at least it was about that that subject.

Lucy
14:20
Uh ha yeah, I haven't really like announced anything official yet, but it's it's gonna be another visual novel and It's gonna be it's gonna be quite short. Uh so somewhere between the length of one night stand and video verse, like maybe just a couple of hours of gameplay. Um, but I'm about to like approach Alpha and basically the reason I've I've not really announced it is just because I can't decide on a name. Like this is always like the problem Uh, with me, it was the same with Videoverse. I just couldn't decide on a anything. And after trying so many different things, I was just like, right, it's just called Videoverse because I honestly I don't know what to call. So I imagine the same thing might happen here, but um one really cool thing, I'm really like proud of the artwork in my next game. I think it's like the nicest artwork that I've done. Um it's got some really nice character animations. So yeah, I'm hoping to announce uh early next year, hopefully releasing around summertime, maybe a bit earlier. We'll s we'll see. It always takes longer than you hope it to.

Samuel
15:26
Oh that's awesome. Well you should come back on then and um and talk about it when it's ready. Was um was there a sense of wanting to do something that was a bit of a lower lift after video verse?

Lucy
15:38
Yeah for sure because um W I know from when I, you know, ported One Night Stand I was working on uh a project that I never actually finished, but Uh a big reason for that was like when when you're porting, even when you're like working with a porter, you still have A lot of like jobs to do and some days it's like, oh we've got to fix these bugs and this isn't working and you have to put the new project aside like to the side. And that happened a lot with like One Night Stand and I knew it was gonna happen again with Videoverse and I find it really hard to like Get into the proper flow when, you know, every day you don't really know what you're working on. Um so For that reason, I was like, right, I'm gonna do something shorter and smaller that I don't really mind if I like take a step back. I have um like a couple of other game ideas at the moment that I'm kind of writing scripts for at like random points. Um, but they're really big game ideas, like maybe like up to like ten hours of gameplay. So that is, you know, when you're a mostly solo developer, that's like several years of your life. So you wanna make sure that you know you've got the proper focus and you can really like give it the attention it needs So yeah, I was like, right, I just need to do something small for now whilst I'm porting video verse. But it's porting really that it just takes up more time than you think it does.

Samuel
17:10
I'll assume that one of those larger projects is an extraction shooter, Lucy. Seems like that'd be your wheelhouse.

Lucy
17:17
That's pretty cool.

Matthew
17:18
Are you still working in Renpe?

Lucy
17:20
Yes, for the next one. But in the other two projects that I was kind of talking about, I would like to move into a different engine. And maybe try a point-and-click adventure game or an RPG. So I do want to kind of branch out of the visual novel uh genre at some point, but I do really like Rempire as well.

Matthew
17:41
I remember s you saying that you you pushed it about as hard as it could go in video verse. Yeah. Um Pulling off things that it wasn't really meant to do, so uh yeah that's exciting.

Samuel
17:55
It's part of it wanting to learn how to make different game types or y learn how to use different engines, Lucy. Like how much of it is sort of I've always dreamed of making this game versus it would be good for me to learn how to do X.

Lucy
18:09
Uh it's more that I I think I have dreams of making other games. I'm I'm a little bit nervous about learning another engine because it's it can be quite a steep learning curve. Um, I do think engines are, you know, they're a lot better than they used to be, a lot more welcoming. And there's a lot more like help and assistance online and tutorials and things. But it, you know, when you're like a commercial developer, it is it is gonna be several months of learning it and not really, you know, progressing, which is quite a a scary thing, you know. With RemPy I'm very, like, comfortable in it now and I know how long it I can you know, get a game finished. It's uh mostly about having that breathing space. I need to be able to like sit back learn it and take my time and you know keep the business running it in the meantime.

Samuel
19:04
I suppose before we get into the topic of this week's episode, I did ask Jay Bayliss this last week as well, Lucy. But what have you been playing this year? Um, because it'd be cool to hear what sort of informs your taste, what you find interesting, that sort of thing.

Lucy
19:15
Yeah, um I think my two favourite games this year have been Promise Mascot Agency and the Hundred Line Last Defense Academy. Which I know Matthew's been playing a bit of.

Matthew
19:26
Yeah. Yeah. Uh well I've been playing loads of it, but that is still only a bit of it. Um you did all of it right, Lucy.

Lucy
19:35
I did, yeah. And I'm so like desperate to talk to people about it. Luckily I had um one of my close friends. Uh he was playing it at the same time, and we both kind of like spurred each other on and somehow we're able to like finish it around the same time. Um but yeah, like it is quite a wild game and it it goes to a lot of crazy places.

Samuel
19:59
Yeah Matthew, where did you last leave that? Are you still chipping away it? Are you on what, you're on playthrough number fifty nine out of a hundred or something?

Matthew
20:06
I actually I actually can't remember. I think I no, I'm more than halfway with it. 'Cause it all branches out from like some super big decisions you make early on and it can really change the character of everything that comes out and I So to to g you know, to put it in terms, uh probably only Lucy will understand, I did I did like all the kind of top branch stuff from the initial decision. Uh so I did loads of stuff there and then it kind of just dawned on me like, oh god, there's whole other realities where all this other stuff's gonna be going on and it's just it's an absolute monster. Uh how long did it take you, Lucy?

Lucy
20:40
Uh I think it was like over 200 hours.

Matthew
20:43
Slimey, yeah.

Lucy
20:44
Yeah. And honestly, like I I have neglected a lot of other games this year. There's so many that I was meant to play that I just I just haven't. Like Donkey Kong Bonanza, I haven't even touched it yet. Um, which is really strange for me. Uh but yeah, like Hundred Line just took up like my whole summer. I think I started it I think it came out in like April or May. Yeah. And I finished it like sometime in September. And I was playing it like several hours every night. Like I d I didn't stop.

Matthew
21:16
Yeah. It's such a brute. How many times have you heard the so the sound effect ding dong bing bong or whatever it is at at the start of every school day? It plays like this the same sound.

Lucy
21:28
Yeah, and um I was playing in English and you get like Siri's like uh Rise and Shine troops and it was driving my husband insane.

Samuel
21:40
Is it worth the the journey, do you think? Ultimately Boosty, does it d by reaching that 200 hour point, does it drastically alter your experience from what it was like, say, fifty to a hundred hours in?

Lucy
21:52
So this is the really sad thing. Not really. Um it's yeah, it's I was there like, come on, I get all a hundred of these endings. There's gonna be something. And um Yeah. So I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but um you have to you have to enjoy the journey, let's just put it that way.

Matthew
22:16
That's really interesting.

Lucy
22:18
I It was like how me and my friend felt about it was like, we just wanna see everything that this game has. If you wanna see everything that it has to offer, you'll have a good time. If you wanna hopefully get something out of doing a hundred innings, you're not gonna have a good time. Um but I I had a good time. I I really enjoyed it. But there are like some like roots and endings that are just that do feel like a bit of a waste of time, which is a shame. because there are some really good ones in there as well. So I think maybe my advice would just be find someone that you trust of like which endings do you think I should do and just focus on like following a guide and doing those. Um because it is it is a time suck. But I d I don't regret it at the same time.

Samuel
23:07
Like when people do those, uh how to watch Star Trek The Next Generation Um these days, but they strip out like forty-five episodes that are apparently complete duds. Like it's uh that sort of guide might be might be quite helpful out of the hundred line. And Progress Masker Agency, uh a game we talked about a lot on this podcast as well. It feels like maybe the the intersection of your your interests, much as it is with ours, Lucy. What was your what what was your story with with that game?

Lucy
23:31
Yeah, like I really liked Paradise Killer. Um so I was like day one I'm gonna get this game. I thought it looked quite like strange, like quite cursed almost. Um Oh yeah. Uh has a like a a very you know, it's this like strange like forgotten town with these weird-looking mascots. But at the same time It's I felt like it was a game made for me. Like I really like Japanese mascots. I follow quite a lot of them, like on Twitter and um Blue Sky. And I really liked their previous game. I love this soundtrack. You know, just like with Paradise Killer, like bangin soundtrack. Yeah, so I it was just it was just really like my jam. Absolutely like loved Pinky. I think Pinky's like one of the best female game characters. like of all time. Really, really love loved her. And just the writing was just so funny. Yeah. What about you guys?

Samuel
24:34
Yeah, I mean we um we were big on that game for sure. I think Pinky should be like Times sort of man of the year. Um definitely. Yeah, we I just yeah, I thought the characters were just really vivid and and Pinky was amazing

Lucy
24:46
Hm. I really quite like the mix of like the Japanese of it but with British humour. Yeah. Hmm. I just think that's really unique and Yeah, I just hope I hope it it's reached enough people, you know? Like that it doesn't get like forgotten at the end of the year of because I it I think it's like my game of the year. I I really, really loved it And um but it is totally i it's almost like it's designed for me.

Samuel
25:16
It it is like Uh you c just by playing it you can identify the sensibilities of people who are who have both have watched both Noel's house party and Evangelion. Like it's it just you can you just get a sense of who the people are from the From the touchstones that are. Absolutely. Very much the OG mascot, I imagine, to those um those craters. Yeah, okay, so you suggested this episode topic, Lucy, which was you suggested a few. I thought they were all good, but I thought this one was something we'd not really talked about before. Um emotional gut punches. The idea of a game uh I guess like affecting you uh emotionally. in a very powerful way. Um what was the thinking behind suggesting this?

Lucy
25:59
Yeah, so um I did my develop talk this year, so I haven't talked to develop before and I decided to do a talk on um how Videoverse successfully delivers several emotional gut punches. And I looked into kind of the story of the game. um the music, all the elements that help design the gut punches. Uh I, you know, I got a lot of player feedback uh that really surprised me. saying like, oh, this was such an emotional roller coaster, um, it made me feel alive again. Like some of the reviews were a bit a bit wild. Um But yeah, like I it just really surprised me. And then um, you know, some you you came to my talk, which was really it was really nice to see you there um because there's always this fear of like is anyone gonna turn up um it's just samuel just slow hand clapping the whole time But yeah, it was it was really nice and I was like, right, I could uh, you know, why not do an episode where we all get a little bit vulnerable and we talk about what, you know, our top kind of emotional moments in games. Um you know, I thought you did an episode recently with Jen Simkins of the art of um video game character customization, I think. And it kind of revealed quite a lot about both of you. So I thought this one would be it might do the same thing.

Samuel
27:33
Well, that was a the the a response to that episode was extraordinary. Like I don't think other than the drafts, Matthew, we've seen anything like that. this year in terms of people commenting on the episode saying how much they liked it. We were genuinely like blown away by that.

Lucy
27:49
Yeah, I really loved it. It actually inspired me to make another game, but I don't have I don't have enough time to make all these games. But I I honestly it was a really cool episode. I really liked it.

Samuel
28:02
I think you can really tell when we have a guest who engages with what the podcast is versus one who maybe is less familiar with it. And that was a real example of Jen unlocking something, I think, 'cause she knew us a little bit and, you know, just had a perspective that you know, we simply do not cannot offer um between the two of us um uh with her interest. So yeah, that that did come out nicely. Um let's see what kind of emotional response you get out of us on a Monday E bit. At the end of a very long year. Let's uh let's let's see. Um so Yeah, I mean y you you mentioned your talk there, you did go into detail about how in that talk about how uh personal connection to some of the events that occur in the game. I was wondering in a general sense, what do you think is the key to making an emotional gut punch land for the player?

Lucy
28:48
Yeah, i I was thinking about this and it's like it's quite difficult to pinpoint, you know, maybe one thing. But I think it needs to be handled with care, so you can't really force it to happen. You can't go in being like, I'm gonna make people cry, you know, 'cause that doesn't really work. Everyone's got their own um you know things that some you know you'll get an emotional reaction out of one person not out of another so it should really be almost like a bit of a surprise that something is even gonna happen. And also like just it feeling natural, I think. If a scene is like just too ham-fisted Or, you know, doesn't really go deep enough or something, like that it won't really hit. Yeah. Is is a tricky one to answer, I think.

Samuel
29:41
Yeah, I guess I feel like so often the intent of games to generate emotional res an emotional response like just doesn't Either doesn't re doesn't reach me as a player because it's a bit too sincere or I don't know. I've had this a a few times where I feel like a game is reaching for something, but if you don't respond to something you feel quite strongly that It's not working for you and it tunes you out of the story a little bit. Yeah. If you can feel the game really. Matthew, don't if you have any thoughts on this. Um, what do you think is the key for making a emotional gut punch land in a game

Matthew
30:13
Yeah, um I I thought what Lucy's there was saying about, you know, it feeling natural and not too forced, that feels right. Like I don't think it is a uh storytelling beat that you can treat like, you know and this yeah, this is where we really land, like the big heavy emotion, you know, peop people don't really work like that. And, you know, I think over the years of Covering games and talking to people who make them, I'm always struck by particularly when you're talking to to about games which have already come out, stuff which really resonated with the developer, but maybe didn't like leave any kind of mark on you and it just makes you realise I think it's quite a rare thing f for someone to sort of uh you know, share some deep emotional truth and for it to land with I mean certainly to land with everyone, but even to land with another person's quite rare. So yeah, I mean it's it's kind of I guess yeah you just gotta kinda go into these things and and be be as open as you can and And uh I wouldn't even say hope for the best, because like I said, I don't think you're going in thinking the end result here is tier, you know, three cries and this game's a success. Um uh you know, where I think maybe you can with other emotions are like slightly more manageable or predictable. Like maybe getting a laugh out of someone, for example, I think is probably less you maybe have a better sense of like, well that that joke works, that joke lands. Um whereas how do you focus test like you know, you're gonna feel some inconsolable grief, you know? Uh tough.

Lucy
31:51
It it was never like that's the thing, it was never like an intention with video verse for it to be like a really emotional game that was gonna make loads of people cry. That was a bit of a happy accident, to be quite honest. I honestly thought I was being a bit self indulgent with it at times. Right. Like, oh I I'm I'm you know, I'm creating this um this artwork. to kind of help me through something and I didn't yeah, I just didn't expect that players would resonate with that, but they did.

Samuel
32:20
Um I suppose actually before we pivot directly into games, I will ask about the idea of an emotional gut punch more generally. I did realise, Lucy, while you're talking that, top emotional moments probably would have been a more uh elegant title than putting gut punches in a document like 14 times. Um but here we are. Um, so Matthew, I'll start with you. What's the first time uh in a piece of media that uh uh uh you know something got you emotionally um that really hit you in that very pronounced way?

Matthew
32:47
Uh as far back as my sort of sh shitty memory will will take me, I can remember when we were in school we used to have a daily book reading. The teacher would read like a chapter of a book to us and over the course of the term like we'd get through a book. Storytime I guess. Um so maybe it was infant school, I can't remember. And I remember we read or had read to us this uh this is really morkish and naff if anyone's read this. Story about like a like an evacuee in wartime. Good night, Mr. Tom. Have you re do you m have you heard that? Yeah, I've seen the annotation.

Lucy
33:24
Oh, I have heard of it. I haven't I haven't actually like seen it or read it.

Samuel
33:29
I've I've seen the it's the one with Daniel Radcliffe and John thought.

Matthew
33:34
I think they did adapt it later, but um yeah like this city kid goes out to like he's an evacuee, he goes out to the countryside. uh lives with this horrible old geezer who he's really like scared of and it's all very intense and you know when you're a child it kind of taps into your imagination that idea of not being where you want to live and being stuck with like a scare scary old person, you know. I c if if you had scary grandparents like I did, you can relate. Um and um but he uh uh uh maybe I'm getting some of the specifics wrong here. He sort of He sort of runs he basically has a really good he ends up having a really good life and this this guy's actually taking really good care of him and I can't remember if he runs away or whether his mother comes and collects him and sort of brings him back into quite a dire situation, like a terrible setup and, you know, sh she's quite struggling. I think she's she's just had a baby as herself and you know, in the city, so he's got taken back to this dangerous place and in hindsight a bit of a sort of child abuse story, but obviously kind of packaged up for kids, so it's not too heavy. And uh yeah he just goes and sort of you know, collects him and sort of save sort of saves him, I guess, from this from this quite dire life. But I can I can remember everyone like everyone in the class being just like absolutely wrecked by this book. a kind of collective outpouring of such a kind of compassionate act that this guy did, you know, and he arrived at right time and this this boy had been through some terrible things with this baby and grueling stuff, but uh I think that's the first time I can remember something kinda getting under my skin. I mean in in truth, I'm a I'm a huge like gru baller in films.

Lucy
35:20
Um that's B-A-W-L-E-R.

Matthew
35:25
Just yeah, I'll weep at all kinds of stuff You know, even when we're watching TV, I'll get a little teary-eyed and c Catherine like never does. So I feel like I just feel like this big sort of wimp on the end of the sofa sometimes We watched the end of Blue Lights, the BBC's Belfarcet police thriller, and even that got me a little bit sniffly, because I was like, oh, it's all so they're all so kind to each other. Um that's all I want is a kindness. Yeah, that's what triggers me.

Lucy
35:52
That's something that that usually sets me off as well. Like if someone's really sweet I'm like, oh my god Yeah, just the right type.

Matthew
36:00
Just like, oh yeah, that's so good that someone stepped in. I mean that you know, but that makes it sound sophisticated and it is. I mean I could remember like one of the times I've whipped the hardest at a piece of media. was fucking um in Smallville of um Jonathan Kent dying and being like, oh Superman's got me so messed up because of this.

Samuel
36:23
Uh so yeah. A bit of that too. I don't mean to laugh at your uh laugh at your grief towards a fictional character Matthew, but it's only the smallville element of it that made me The maybe chuckle. And um Lucy, what about you? What do you remember as being your earliest emotional gut punch?

Lucy
36:38
Yeah, I think mine was Mufasa's death in The Lion King.

Samuel
36:42
Oh

Lucy
36:43
Which I think was was quite a common one. Um but I think I was like seven years old at the time And I remember being in the cinema just watching it and like started crying. And I don't think I'd ever done that before. And I remember being a bit embarrassed, like looking at my mum like, I don't think I should be should be crying, but also like this music like swelling and And Simba's on his own and he's like like crying and like shaking him and he's not getting up and like honestly I I think like the Lion King was like because of that was like my favorite movie for years afterwards. And it's still like my favorite Disney movie now, I think. And was a big reason of like why I wanted to become an animator. It's like, yeah, I want to do animation at university. I I love how much emotion can come across in that medium. Um yeah, it it really it still gets to be now if I if I watch that scene.

Samuel
37:47
Yeah. I mean it's v it's very well done. It's an amazing film. I just yesterday I was having a debate with someone about why I think that Elton John doesn't ruin the Lion King, but Phil Collins does ruin Tarzan. Because I just I think that For some reason the Elton John music just fits a little bit better, but I find it massively distracting in Tarzan when you can hear hear Phil Collins wailing in the background and getting on his drum set. Uh it's just yeah. But I could I could see why that would get you. Disney movies a key thing for me too. So I remember I I don't remember seeing much of Bambi, but I do know that I made my parents leave in the middle of the screening. For reasons I'm not totally sure of, like I I don't have any memory of watching the scene of Bambi's mother being killed, but that is like probably one of the most famous touchstones of a you know, uh something affecting children emotionally 'cause it's obviously such a devastating moment. I will tell you one that I do remember is that I find and I think this reflects the sort of moments that can really get me emotionally. At the very end of the jungle book, when Mowgli goes off to the human village and says goodbye to his animal companions, is like that's kind of burned into burned into my brain. Because it's it's very kind of like mournful. It's like I have to say goodbye to childhood almost, like this this part of my life that was, you know, was so important to me. And I think it's when people uh talk about that imaginary friend disappearing in inside out, I think actually it's kind of the same thing that jungle book does at the very end where it's like you're almost saying goodbye to your imaginary companions. These can can be here no longer for whatever reason. So that that's all strike that sticks with me because I definitely think a couple of my moments are in that vein of feeling quite hollow at the end of something. And that being, you know.

Lucy
39:38
It does feel like that. It's like a real loss, isn't it? Like it you're not you're not really happy for him. At least I'm not.

Samuel
39:45
No, because you know he can never go back, that's the thing. Yeah, it's very well done. Um so uh yeah, and then I think I I've definitely had I don't really cry much these days, to be honest. I think I've cried once in five years, which is not many, but definitely as a teenager, I think T V shows used to get me a lot. I definitely remember a couple of buffy episodes here or there really getting me. But yeah, nothing then like the terrible singing. Fuck you. Fuck you. Once more we're feeling absolute banger of an episode. Yes, like a couple of them can't sing, Matthew, but what of it? Um yeah, so it's uh yeah, uh a few different things really. I'm sure more revelations will come up as we get into the episode. Um I think let's transition to games then. What about the first time a video game got you emotionally? Uh Matthew, I'll start with you.

Matthew
40:31
Uh I kinda sort of struggled with this one because I don't think my relationship with them as like a child and a teenager was particularly sort of ripe for this kind of stuff or maybe by being like a Nintendo fan where the games are you know are largely about pure joy and just the energy and excitement of playing them, you know, like I you know, I've maybe had a positive emotional sort of a you know, just ecstasy at something how ama how amazing something is. I'd say it's much harder for games to get me, and I d I it was it was kinda like harder to come up with my picks for this episode actually. Uh because yeah, I know they have to work sort of double doubly hard. I mean It may even be like, you know, into the twenties. You know, some of the some of the visual novel things I've played, Virtue's Last Reward or something, just feeling sort of terrible for some of the outcomes and s you know, some of the characters, but Again, I don't know if by that point I'm I'm playing them so much as part of a job. I'm always sort of a sort of analysing them like I'm almost one step removed. Uh I do find it quite hard to properly lose myself in these things, which is a unhelpful answer for this question.

Lucy
41:45
I know what you mean though. Like I do start overanalysing these things now. And it's really hard to like just relax whilst playing a game. It's easier with T V, 'cause I'm not judging it in the same way. What

Matthew
41:58
Well I one thing I do remember and and it's like not a you know a game I'm hugely fond of but I you know to give it some credit I remember when I previewed Heavy Rain and the opening bit where I think he was just like playing with his kid in the garden and like running around with his with the like the kid on his shoulders. I mean quite sort of sentimental and schmalty and cliched as as a lot of stuff is in David Cage games. But There's quite a big age gap between me and my brothers and sisters and, you know, I I think I was still of an age where I feel quite sort of homesick or yearning for uh you know, that that sort of simpler life or whatever. And I remember in the preview thinking, oh well if if everything kind of works like that scene worked, you know, this actually could be, you know, incredibly successful It's just that where the story went in that game was wild and silly. But I remember my preview of it being quite positive actually. Somewhere out there there's a gushing edge preview of heavy rain.

Samuel
42:57
where I thought it it might have been the next big thing. Well, I think I know the real reason here. You identified it at the start there, you played Nintendo games. Um people who had PlayStations and PlayStation 2s, Matthew, did experience real emotion. And um so so I'll ask you, Lucy, how about you? Like what were your emotional Touch points of games. What was the first time you remember a game doing this?

Lucy
43:16
Uh yeah, like it was Final Fantasy VII. But I did play it on PC. I didn't have a PlayStation for quite a while. But yeah, like the emotional part that got to me is actually one of my picks. So I don't know if you want me to elaborate more on it here or or we can say a second later.

Samuel
43:35
It took a while for me to to to encounter games that really did this. I feel like I started to notice it more When I bought a PS2. Like um it's sort of it almost doesn't really count, but something like Max Payne actually where the death of his wife and child is a ga you know, it's a it's a thing that the they turn into gameplay um that they make kind of harrowing. And that really stays with you. And along along similar lines and at the same time, um I would say the opening to even though it's like an action set piece, the beach sequence in Medal of Honor Allied Assault which draws on saving Private Ryan. That is very emotionally effective and it was so elevated in its presentation. in terms of you just seeing hundreds of your own troops being gunned down on this beach um while you were basically frantically trying to survive. It was you know or inspiring in terms of what they're able to pull off, but also harrowing as well. And so that was a bit of a sense of this is quite far from what even medal of honour on PS1 with its like pokey little corridor levels and occasional encounters with Nazis could really pull off. This is like This is an el this is elevated in terms of what it's able to convey of the historical setting. It's just really effective at doing that. And it it's definitely bor borrowing from saving Private Ryan, but no one had ever done that in a game before. Um so that was very powerful. There are definitely other examples I will um we can maybe talk about as we get into the picks as well. But uh Yeah.

Matthew
45:04
I just I just remember there being uh a sneering culture as such, but definitely when I was at Future I remember every once in a while something would come along which had a bit of emotional heft to it or was you know, trying to a achieve something a a bit more sophisticated in that way and you know, hearing so and so c cried at blah and it being a being a bit of a sort of um uh you know, not laughing stock, but uh there was certainly a bit of sort of disdain for the idea that a video game could kind of get you there.

Lucy
45:35
I remember when The Last of Us came out a very specific and I won't name who it is.

Matthew
45:39
But I can remember like a and Andy Robinson, you know, sort of proclaiming that, oh it makes so you know, so and so said they cried like five times as in like you know, we've got to play us this game that apparently gets to you in that way, you know, as as if it was like a sort of guaranteed thing. The conversation stopped being like, wait until you see the crazy graphics in this game and then all of a sudden you start having these sort of They say it's gonna make you cry as if that's an urban legend doing the rounds.

Samuel
46:08
Well, I I think we've got a lot more to discuss in part two as we count down our own emotional uh top emotional moments from video games. So uh let's take a quick break and We'll come back and talk about it some more. Welcome back to the podcast. So we've each selected five emotional gut punches. Yes, I'm gonna keep using that that term um as we go. So we'll start with you, Lucy. Do you want to pick one of yours and then we'll kind of uh we'll rotate and uh come back around?

Lucy
46:44
Yeah. Okay, let's go with um the ending of Lyka Dragon Gaiden, the man who erased his name. So yeah, I guess there's gonna be a lot of spoilers in all of our picks because usually the most emotional part is towards the end of a game. Um

Samuel
47:04
But yeah this maybe what we'll do is we'll say the name of the game and then you can know whether to like pause it or fast forward a few minutes and then we'll say what the moment is. That might be a good way of doing it, and then it's kind of fair enough. But uh yeah, please carry on Lucy.

Lucy
47:18
So this is at the end of the game where Kiru kind of breaks down crying. It's quite a long cutscene. And if if you've been like a longtime Yakuza fan, you've played Kiru s in so many games. He's stoic, he's strong, he can get angry, he can get sad. but he doesn't ever get kind of broken like he does at the end of this game. It's almost like, you know, seeing your dad cry or something. Like this really strong figure is completely broken down and it's proper like ugly crying the Animation here is like incredible. There's like snot dripping down like Kiru's nose onto this like iPad that he's looking at. And on on the iPad is like him looking at footage of um I think they is it the Dai I I can't really remember Gaiden too well. I think it's like the Daidoji group that's kind of um, you know, taken Kiru, given him a new name. Uh he's now Joru. He doesn't you know, he's faked his death. And they the Dai Dojis show uh footage of the kids visiting his grave on like the anniversary of his death. And then I think a couple of the kids spot the camera that's on on the grave and they go up to it And then they start like talking to him like, Oh, we don't actually really believe that you're dead. We understand why you've probably faked your death and we like to think you're still out there. And then they just give like updates on like how they're doing. And then Kiru just starts crying. And he's happy that they're doing well. But then the kids are like, we're just really like sorry that y you might be lonely, you might be on your own if you're still out there. Like they've they've grown up to this point where they're also worrying about him as well. Like they've become adults. And then like They get they say like on the day after we went back to the grave and there was like a drawing left from Haruto who's Harika's son. And that's the kid that is like a rugby ball in the accusa six. If anyone remembers the scene where they're like throwing this baby around. Which is it's Yukusa 6 is still a really weird one for me. Um but this this this little boy's like I think he's like four or five now in Gaiden and he's drawn this picture and Like Hiru just like at this point he's like he can't hold back the tears anymore. Like he's like crying. I think what makes this scene so good is his voice actor uh Tayaka Kuroda. Does such a good job. Like you can hear it in his voice, like he is choking up here. Like he's like, look at that. Like Please share this moment with me. Look, like this little boy's growing up. He's drawn everyone. And he's just like He's just so sad and I think honestly I just think it's that voice performance is like it propagates to me. Like I can't not get upset. And you've had like, you know, especially if you've been a long time Yakuza fan, you've had like what, seven or eight games at this point. of this man being like this pillar of like it's such a sad ending to like Hiru's story, but I think it's such a it's such a good ending. Which is why it's kind of strange when he comes back in infinite wealth and then there's other stuff going on. I don't know if they know how to say goodbye to Kiru. But I do think in Gaiden they did a really good job with it.

Matthew
51:16
Does feel like they're taking a sort of second run at it in a way, you know, like uh um a sense of or did the I mean I don't know, do you do you think they sort of yeah how do you feel about about Yusa Six? Do you think they sort of if that had been the end of his story, would would you have been happy with that?

Lucy
51:33
I actually would have. Okay. Um which is s it's so strange because I do think this scene in Gaiden is is fantastic. It's like the whole game's kind of okay, but that ending was like, wow, that that was a great game. Like it's one of like my higher kind of Yakuza games.

Matthew
51:50
Right.

Lucy
51:50
And I I do think it it does do a good job because I I was really wary like oh they should have just let Kiru go in at the end of Six. Um, but then they did this and I was like, actually I've kind of come around now like this is really it's really interesting. And I was a bit more like warming up to like infinite wealth, like, okay, we're gonna see more of Kiru now and this is gonna get really emotional. I do have some issues with Infinite Valve, but I also think it does some things really, really good as well. But I am a bit at this point I'm a bit we've had like pirate recuser now, and I I'm a little bit worried of like What is what is gonna happen with Kiryu at this point? Like is it is it ever gonna get as good as it as this scene in Gaiden? I I'm not sure if it will. Um But I guess we'll see, you know.

Matthew
52:39
But it is a powerfully messy cry that he has.

Lucy
52:42
I mean it's yeah it's so gooey.

Matthew
52:45
May maybe like it's it's I'd say it's verging on like Oh no, it's too gooey.

Lucy
52:52
Um Almost, yeah.

Matthew
52:53
When when there's like just like snot streaming down from his nose and like pooling on an iPad screen, it's just like, Oh man, now I know I never cry man

Samuel
53:05
I mean Matthew, you have a moment in this vein. I wonder if you want to bring this forward because it's so it seems like it's relatively connected.

Matthew
53:13
Yeah, well now I'm worried that uh Lucy finds this moment trite. Go ahead. I mean rather than being a I guess a specific moment, it's it's more of an act of a story, but in infinite wealth, the sort of still anonymous Kyriu uh has cancer now I think that's quite well known about this game. and uh has to sort of step away from the action just because he's he's getting a sort of a a bit frail and he returns home and he has this sort of uh almost like sort of victory lap I guess of going to like old haunts and being reminded of old games and it's like a it's a huge nostalgia play and and that really works for me. I'm a I'm a sucker for just being reminded of, you know, that time moves on and um, you know, even though they also try and do like these nostalgic flashbacks to like Like the silliest spin-offs. What's the zombie one? Like there's even a there's like a a reference to that and Dead Souls. Yes. Yeah. And so it's like a real kind of like you know, it's powerful but it's also like completionist, which I like. Yeah, he ends up going uh sort of meeting up with um the detec his old detective friend Is it Darte?

Lucy
54:29
Darte, is that it's pronounced? Yeah, Date sound.

Matthew
54:32
Yeah. And a bit of Christmas carol energy kind of sort of takes him on a tour of like all the lives he's impacted. It's like a good it's like a positive ghost of uh Yakuza present in showing him like all this is the positive impact you've had on all these lives and he sort of spies on all these people and sort of sees how they're getting on and you know, again it's it allows them to have all these sort of cameos from the older games, but I was just uh Given that this series has focused so intensely on, you know, this person's life, there's not many video games characters who kind of exist in a realistic timeline like that, who you would who you are able to explore mortality and the sort of melancholy around that and feeling like, you know, it's all been for nothing and kind of questioning your place in things and So, you know, rather than being like, Oh, there was one specific interaction that really got me, I d I just I really liked the act of this. Uh I mean that there are questions of whether or not this emotional reckoning he goes through is quite as powerful when it's nested in infinite wealth, which obviously is very silly and there's lots of other wild stuff going off in Hawaii. It's like you have all this sort of fun in Hawaii and then you come back for Kyriu's sort of sad farewell tour and that can maybe be a little jarring. But I I don't know, I th I thought it really, really worked for me. Getting to witness your own reputation you know, as it is to other people and I don't know. Maybe does anyone else have the fantasy of being able to like sit in at their own funeral and hear what everyone says? It's a bit like that. Which is something I would like to do.

Lucy
56:13
Yeah, I'm I'm the same. I'd I'd rather not know. Oh, I definitely know.

Matthew
56:16
I just want to make sure like some people absolutely bring it. Like Sam, you'll really have to like deliver the goods. People expect it off my podcast co-host.

Samuel
56:25
Why you why are you so certain that you'll outlive me? I just I'm pretty sure. Well, I'm I'm curious, Lucy, as as someone who has strong feelings on what they've they've done with Kieryu, what you made of this um this moment. To me it seems like The silly and the serious always coexist in Yakuza, so it shouldn't be too much. It shouldn't break the game to do this sort of thing, Matthew, to your your point there about how silly um infinite wealth is more generally but curious to get your take Lucy.

Lucy
56:53
Yeah no I think this is the best part of the game, to be honest. Like I I had more issues with like Itchy Band's side and like Hawaii and stuff. Um I think The the uh Kiru side of it, it's like I was a bit surprised, like, oh he's back. Um and they still don't know quite how to say goodbye, but now he's got like terminal cancer, it's like okay. I I guess this is goodbye, but even now I'm like, is it?

Matthew
57:19
Is he gonna eat some kind of immortality fruit or something? Uh after poet Yakuza, anything's possible.

Lucy
57:28
Yeah. Um We we shall see in the next game, I guess. But I that's the thing, like this was such a so Guiden had the kind of like emotional side of it. This had a really nice like let's see everyone that we've seen over the course of the game. And they really brought back like most people. Yeah. Uh his like love interest in in two who I forget the name of, uh, but she's even in it. And I think it's the same voice actress as well. Um, they really like put a lot of effort in here. Like Akiyama shows back up. Um I just think it you know and Date Sang is kind of there throughout most of it. I just think it's really nice. It's really sweet, like seeing These like older men like caring about these things and caring about Kiru and honestly it was like it was the best part of the game for me and I was just a bit sad, like it you know, sometimes it just didn't the the game as a whole just felt a bit scattered, like it wasn't quite sure what it was doing. Yeah. Um I'm I'm also just in the vein of like Ichiban like needs to kind of the torch needs to be passed. If if that's what they're doing, then it should it sh he should just have his own game and just move forward and let's get on with this. And I feel like they can't like Hiru go.

Matthew
58:52
Um well Ichiban only came tenth in the fan pole of best jacuza characters that came out today that they did for the twentieth anniversary, so I imagine they're like Oh dear.

Lucy
59:03
Wow, that's really low.

Matthew
59:06
Yeah. Our guy Kuze was like thirty-four many. The first woman in the list was twenty-seven and at twenty-six was a man with an orange for a head.

Lucy
59:17
Is that Anna Michi?

Matthew
59:18
Yeah, yeah. Amazing.

Lucy
59:21
Well, that says a lot about that fan base.

Matthew
59:24
Toxic. Toxic fan base The only other thing which slightly um not undermines but like hammers home the sort tonal bizarrness of Yakuza is that as he observes all the people from his past and sees how everyone's getting on and sort of reminisces about them. He then unlocks them as summons in the fights, so he can sort of have the people from his past come back and like deck people in a really colourful animation, which I like.

Samuel
59:49
Um I guess I should pick one. And Um, all of minor deaths.

Lucy
59:53
I just realized that.

Samuel
59:54
That's not very original, is it? But um I did want to tick off some some stuff that I think will be familiar to listeners, but also That is a, you know, that are very kind of uh very me coded, I guess. Um so there's a spoiler for Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, the first of the two games that came out in 2019. And as I was typing out the words the death of JarrotaPow slash order 66. I w I I could just imagine Matthew Castle opening this document And rolling his eyes so hard at that combination of words.

Matthew
01:00:26
Um I I di I searched Jaro Tapal and then the the face that popped up in Google Insert, I did laugh.

Samuel
01:00:36
He is basically like what if Thanos was a Jedi knight? He's a big purple man, basically.

Lucy
01:00:41
Um wow.

Samuel
01:00:44
But hey, knock yourself out. Well so I I think this is like a very I think this moment is bet is the probably the best executed emotional moment of either of these two games, even though there's a A big twist in Jedi Survivor that I think is amazing and that the game really earns. And I didn't think was actually super obvious. At least like not at the point at which it happens in the game. So that that's definitely one moment, but I I'm keen not to spoil that 'cause I don't think enough people have still played Jedi Survivor and I want them to go play it because it's my favourite blockbuster game of the last five years. So people should go play that. Um but this moment it's It's done really well. You play as the child version of Kalchestis, your main character, and it's a flashback and you so you you realize that where Kalchestus has been raised basically as a Jedi where he's been trained. is around all of these like clone soldiers in the midst of the Clone Wars. So all those dudes who sound like they're from New Zealand and wear those um white helmets. He sort of like knows them very well. And so they're like parts of the sequence where They're talking to him like he's a friend. They're like, oh hey Cal, how's it going? Like one of them like um sort of like, you know, does a high five with him and that sort of thing. So they're like uh the game does a really good job of establishing that these Soldiers are just part of your life and you know they're they're part of existing with this um you know, like uh being part of the Jedi Order really who are at war. And then um when Order sixty six happens, like all of these guys who are your who are established to be your friends, like turn on you and your master. And you basically just as like the child version of your character, what watch your master just get like uh cut down by all of these guys. And it's really sad. And I think the reason it works is because the game is really good at establishing that Cao is like wounded by something. That he's not actually a Jedi Knight, that he's on the run um because the Empire dominates the galaxy. And a lot of the different characters he comes into contact with are dealing with their own kind their own sort of feelings of grief as well. And it's only watching this moment that I think you really you start to understand just how much um grief is like part of the game or is a a theme in the game. And there's something else that the game does, I think, that that captures the your your changing perception of Cal. So you do just think he's like this slightly cheeky chappy Jedi guy who's on the run. And then you sort of like it just dawns on you as you go that he doesn't really know what he's doing, that he's up against incredibly difficult odds and um and like doesn't have many people in his life. So the people he the connections he's forged are important. And it's it's even represented in like NPC the dialogue that you have um with BD or little robot lad, he goes from sort of reassuring the his little um droid uh droid pal at the start of the um the game be like you okay BD to at the end like the droids asking you are you okay actually and then him sounding quite vulnerable when he responds and I find that arc really like successful creatively. And yeah, it spoke to me. And so yeah, I do I fucking hate trying to justify Star Wars to Matthew Carson. But I thought I thought this really worked. And because I um I actually really hate like the whole Clone Wars sort of part of Star Wars. That's completely like uninteresting to me. But the idea of turning What in the what in Revenge of the Sith is like a big dramatic moment, but you know it's undermined by the fact that you've got fucking Sheeve Palpatine, Eamid Diemid like falling over furniture and like doing his silly facial expressions Here the idea of it being like your everyday reality as a kid is like turned upside down and your master is killed in front of you. I just think it's actually like a rare bit of reaching for Star Wars mm you know sort of cinematic level storytelling and actually paying it off. So I thought that was really good. Um there you go. I'd say a powerful moment of Good night, Mr. Tapal Very good. Okay. Uh so li Lucy, what's your next one?

Lucy
01:04:44
Uh yeah, I'm gonna go with an indie game. So have either of you played Botany Manor?

Matthew
01:04:50
No. I have not, but Feel free to to talk about it.

Lucy
01:04:54
So this was like uh kind of advertised as like a cute, cosy game kind of thing. You go around this beautiful manor house and you try and basically like grow these rare plants and get them to bloom. So it's a bit of a puzzle game. It's a little bit like I guess you could compare it to like the Witness or even maybe Obra Din. you kind of like going around trying to search for clues. And I only played this one recently for um IGF. I was like doing some judging. So I I I think and I think it came out last year, so I really wasn't like sure like I'd like it. It really caught me by surprise. So this is a game that's set I think it's in like the Victorian times, uh, in England, in this beautiful manor house. And you the the puzzles are like you you get a uh this rare seed of a plant and you have to try and get it to grow and then you need to get it to bloom and Each one you're like trying to research, it's a plant that you've never heard of before. So you're trying to like understand like what temperature does this plant like? What kind of soil acidity? Does it like uh is it uh like an alpine plant that needs like uh wind, all this kind of stuff. And along the course of the game, you'll see like uh like letters and things around around the garden. And they're usually quite misogynistic in tone or like quite sexist. Like there's a lot of like put-downs from like you you play as a as a female researcher. And you get like these letters from like the you know, the male professors and they're like, Yeah, we don't really think your research is that important or I I don't think you're right about this or you shouldn't be doing this, like why aren't you married yet? All this kind of stuff And it also comes from like you you even get like a letter from her auntie who's like seriously like you need to be married now and all this kind of stuff that you think like it's very kind of like Jane Austen um inspired I guess Uh but you also get like letters from like other women, like mothers who are like, oh, thank you so much for like teaching my kids about these plants and all this stuff. Anyway, you keep play it's not really like a narrative game. This is what kind of surprised me. It's like, oh we're just going around like trying to grow these plants. But right at the end of the game, like everything that you're doing as a player is to like aid her research and you write everything down like this is how we get this plant to like grow and and bloom. um and you submit the uh research off to the publisher and see if they'll like publish the book. So spoilers the book right at the end of the game, everything that you've done, the book doesn't get published. You get a letter from like, I think it's your sister saying, I'm so sorry that that didn't happen. And the main reason is like i i is like is the times basically is like women aren't expected to be doing this at this point. And it really hurts. At least it hurts for me. Um being like a woman in quite a male-dominated field. It's like this is like this is quite a personal attack, you know. But what's so lovely about this ending is like, okay, her book didn't get published and y I should note that you play in like first person, so you don't see what this character looks like. It's very good at like putting you in the shoes of of her. But right at the end, she's like, well, my book didn't get published, but I've converted my library into a classroom and I'm gonna be teaching young girls about plants and just education in general. And I'm gonna like teach these girls and we'll take it from there. And it's so sweet and it really caught me off guard because again, like this is more of like a puzzle exploration game. I thought it was just like a a a cozy game, you know? Like I did not expect this really deep story. And for me, like it felt like Really impactful. I think because it also made me think about like my mum and my grandma and the things that they didn't have, the opportunities they didn't have. And yeah, it made me feel really sad for like for for just women in like that time, you know? Um so it's it's a very like female oriented game. I feel like I've not heard a lot of people talk about it, but I just thought it was incredible. So I wanted to highlight it.

Matthew
01:09:59
Yeah, I had That's really good. I had no idea. Like I'd seen screenshots and little clips of it or whatnot and I thought I had the idea of that game in my head, but uh you know the that sounds great. The the the idea of sort of smuggling in something, you know, not overtly being about that or announcing that. But I know I assume the marketing of it all the you know it doesn't say like and discover a powerful

Lucy
01:10:27
No, it doesn't. I I just wasn't expecting it at all. Yeah. It really caught me off guard. And I I'm like Like really crying a lot towards the end, like I remember being like, why why am I crying? This is just meant to be like a a cute little puzzle game. Um But yeah, like I I really loved it. It's one of the best, like, games I've played this year, but it did come out last year, and now I feel really bad for like kind of glossing over it and thinking like, oh there's not, you know, that much going on here. There really is. And yeah, like, give it a go. I think you guys would probably still really like it. And it's quite short as well. I think it's only like four, five hours, something like that.

Matthew
01:11:12
Unfortunately it's also got detective elements, Samuel, so uh

Lucy
01:11:25
From like a a puzzle point of view, I really enjoyed the puzzles. Like uh I tend to get kind of frustrated like things either get too difficult or they're too easy. For me, it was like the perfect difficulty throughout the whole game. Like I really got along with it.

Matthew
01:11:39
Nice.

Samuel
01:11:41
Yeah, that really um passed me by, but that's a really uh great endorsement of it and not one that's so spoilery it would put me off playing it. So um on the wish list it goes. Um it is actually currently um forty percent off on Steam, so um yeah, yeah a great A great recommendation. Matthew, what's your next one?

Matthew
01:11:58
This feels incredibly basic bitch after that quite sophisticated analysis.

Samuel
01:12:02
I've got some really dumb ones coming up. If you thought Jarry Tapo was dumb.

Matthew
01:12:06
You just you wait. Uh I'm picking uh the opening to Ori and the Blind Forest, which is uh a sort of a An a playable kind of narrative prologue of about ten minutes that shows how Ori, who is um this little sort of forest spirit sprite thing. sort of comes down to the forest and makes friend with this big I don't know let's call it a bear. It's not a bear but it kind of looks like a bear. This big furry cute thing called Naru and you Yeah, you sort of hang out with you hang out with Naru and you kind of make a home and you know, it it it's both a sort of tutorial for the moves, but also has these brilliant sequences where it sort of segues into almost like animated montage and it does have like an animator's eye for how quickly i it shows like the passing of time and shows like this friendship very quickly um developing. Uh and then uh because this is an emotional gut punch, you can tell that it this doesn't just uh end up with them being friends for the whole game. There's uh I I think there's like a sort of uh a blight comes to the forest and the food dries up and your mate Naru uh sort of dies of starvation in the opening e minutes of Ori in the Blind Forest. And it's Plays This Beautiful Music by Gareth Coker. It's like one of my favourite game soundtracks of all time. And It just, you know, my critics hat, you're like, oh that's a really efficient bit of storytelling the way it sort of establishes this and you understand fully what's happened to them, but I think tonally it it definitely it definitely gets you it could so easily have been like very naff and schmaltzy this opening, but it it did really work for me and I think it sets the the tone for a for a Metroidvania, which is what it is, in a very clever way, in that, you know, those are games which are all about kind of power curves and, you know, you're meant to start off in an incredibly vulnerable position and then feel yourself sort of amassing powers and you know it star i Ori is, you know, very lonely at the start, you know, the only sort of friend, the only companion it had um is gone and I think in terms of just establishing like stakes and the tone of the story and the tone of that particular game like you suddenly, you know, you're not just alone but you're also in a scary forest and you can't really do much and it's you know, quite difficult and I I wasn't expecting an emotional hit in this particular genre, which I think of as very video gamey, you know, quite like artificial in a way. It's it's something I play to kind of play the collectathon, the quite mechanical sort of shape of it. But uh yeah, this was great.

Lucy
01:15:06
I was really surprised that they killed him off when I played it. Yeah. Because it's right at the start and I felt like in the marketing, like you saw a lot of this character. Right. And it was like, oh, it's gonna be like I you know, I thought when going into it, oh it's gonna be like two characters and you can switch between them or something. Um and I was like devastated at the beginning. And I you know for the whole game I'm like, when is he gonna come back?

Matthew
01:15:31
They should have had a character switching mechanic that just goes to like narrow, sad grave every time you switch. It'd be a very different game, just to really like underline what happened.

Samuel
01:15:44
Matthew as narrative director in a of video games. That's uh you're right, Matthew. I don't associate that genre with you know with storytelling as much as getting new powers and feeling more awesome um as I go. So yeah, very different. But certainly set it apart. That the and the music and the art direction I feel like really let this game stand out above all the different Metroidvania's that were that were coming out around that time and um still much beloved. Okay. Next up then we've got we've got to talk about Final Fantasy if we're doing emotional moments because It's a series that swings hard for them. If I was being completely honest, I would probably have picked the very end of Final Fantasy X when we um

Lucy
01:16:26
Sorry, um I got distracted by Lucy highlighting the document, which is absolutely fine, Lucy. No no please carry on about this.

Matthew
01:16:32
Um just Lucy just annotated this point with bullshit. Yeah, I got distracted by that too.

Samuel
01:16:49
Final Fantasy the end of Final Fantasy X, if I'm being completely honest with you, that was like a that was probably the moment really. I know people probably pick either the um the the the the dance unit's sending that happens in Final Fantasy X When Sin um fucks up Killiker Village, kills loads of people, and um then she sends them off to the Far Plane, which is basically Final Fantasy X literal version of the afterlife. Um you can literally go there and think about think about the people who have passed and then see them there. Very sad game um with uh life and death uh sort of themes. really kind of like casting a shadow over everything that happens in that game. Um see also uh Claire Obscure Expedition thirty three, which uh very much borrowed from that playbook. And I I um I really like the ending of Final Fantasy X. Um I guess again, spoiler alert, so it's because Your main character disappears because it's established that your character is uh is a dream um that is is being dreamt of by the the one of the the main spiritual force of this world spirra And so you must disappear once um once uh sin um has disappeared because it's all connected basically. It's all part of like one big dream and in order for this world to be free of this cycle of life and death. uh the dream has to end. And so your character disappears, um Tidas, and then um there's a a very short scene after the credits that suggests he may um still be alive. Personally think that the story is more effective if you think of Final Fantasy X as its own beginning, middle, and end. Um, much as I'm sure I know people some people really enjoy the fan service adventures of the three girls in Final Fantasy XI. And I certainly don't begrudge them that. But in terms of Tida's specific story, I think that that game uh resolves it really well. Do you know what I'm just gonna pick that one instead of the one I actually put in my document, which was the death of Zack in Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Which is also very effective and very sad. He gets uh it this that moment is so pervasive in the halls of Square Enix that it poisoned their brains when making the Final Fantasy VII remake games. And it's like the crux Zack's death and how it's staged is Is a a key part of the sort of story that plays out in parallel in that game. Um so I'll highlight that as well. But Final Fantasy in general is just very good for creating moments like this. No shortage of character deaths over the years, but the Final Fantasy X ending is the one that um I liked so much I had it recorded on VHS. There you go, a little bit of vulnerability for embarrassing Samuel. uh fourteen years old. Yeah, you know, I was a teenager.

Matthew
01:19:10
Well you know, and out of teen W would you like rewatch it?

Samuel
01:19:12
Uh every now and then, yeah. I just sort of had it in case I ever thought I want to watch it because it's actually like a big pain in the ass to see that ending again. This is a time before YouTube, right? So you couldn't just dial it up. You had to fight sin, you have to fight you, a long ending, isn't it? Yeah, it's like about three hours of your time you gotta set aside. So that's why I recorded it. Plus I had a TV video combi Matthew, so you know. These those are all the rage back in O2. Um yeah, so I picked that one. Lucy, I'm guessing uh Final Fantasy X ending probably means more to you than it does to Matthew.

Lucy
01:19:46
Oh yeah, like um Yeah, for sure. Like if I was younger, I think it would definitely would have been in my list as well. Like ten has like quite a special place for me. It's it's not like my top file fancy game. But that ending, like, really destroyed me. Like I I really feel like Yuna's love for Titus and It it's just so sad. It's it's really, really sad. Uh and I think the animation in that game is beautiful as well. Like the FMV cutscenes are really good. And I I think Eunas sending, maybe not like an emotional gut punch, but is a really cool scene that kind of sells that whole world and like what is going on. like really well. Like it's a very sad world, but it's also like very beautiful at times as well.

Samuel
01:20:40
The unit the sending is very much a lock the fuck in moment in the story because it's a long FMV to have in like the first act of the game. But you're right, it gives credibility to the lore of the game, to the world of the game, to the the stakes of the game. Yeah, and there are so many uh you know, so many key moments that don't really have like a a a long CG cutscene element, nothing like that. Um but yeah they really invested it in that moment and I think it it pays off.

Lucy
01:21:06
Sticking with the Final Fantasy theme then is Final Fantasy VII. So this is the scene the I think was the first video game moment where I really had an emotional reaction out of it. So I would have been about eleven at this point. And this I think Final Fantasy VII was like the most kind of what felt like an adult serious like kind of game that I played. Um but it's not Eris' Death Um which I know is a lot of people's kind of, you know, gut wrenching kind of kind of moment. Uh for me it's actually like Red Thirteen's quest to find out what happened to his his father. Um so you go on this like I think it's like a an hour of like of a side quest kind of Going into Cosmo Canyon, you meet uh the legendary Bugenhagen, um, the floaty guy, and You learn about um or you learn that Red 13's actually called Nanaky and that he's actually quite young. in um whatever creature he is, like years. He's like a teenager. Um you learn about his past, uh, and that he really loved his mum but he hated his dad and um you know he hates him he's like oh he was a coward he like left my mum to die and all this stuff. So Boogenhagen's like, oh is that really what you think? Let's like go through the cave and I want to show you something. Um and along the way, like Buchenhagen tells him like uh the story of this great warrior. Uh you fight lots of like really scary, like, big monsters along the way. And then there's the boss at the end, um, one of the Ghee Warriors. Um and then once you've done that, you go out into this like um open like cave area and you see like this petrified like red 13 on the top and you're like who's that and it's like that's your father that was the gr the great warrior um and it's like he wasn't a coward he like sacrificed himself he got like petrified And it really surprised me at the time. I think maybe because I was I was quite young. Um but the bit that really gets to me Is I think first off, like I'm a huge like Nobu Uimatsu fan. Absolutely love his music. The music in this scene is like beautiful. But then um Red 13 kind of feels kind of bad for like, oh, I I didn't realize that this was the truth. And then like these like really low polygon tears kind of drop from the petrified uh seto. And it has this little like jingly like sound effect. And for some reason, that just gets to me so so much more because I I think and that this is a reason why I really don't I don't like like remake or rebirth that much at all.

Samuel
01:24:20
Now you're speaking my language, Lucy.

Lucy
01:24:23
I could have a a huge rant of of why, but I I do think, like, in a nutshell, the original feels like almost like a a storybook. You're kind of like looking in at these little like toy people and you can project so much of yourself on them because th they've barely got any facial expressions and, you know, they're really low polygon. Um and that kinda makes it your own. It's i it is like reading a storybook, uh for me anyway. And Just seeing these like low poly tears like falling down and then Cloud is like, this is a serious moment for like Red. We're gonna leave we you know, they turn around, they leave him, and he's just with his dad. and he then he howls up at the moon. Oh howls up at Sato. And it just really you know, again it's this really like bitty sound effect of a howl. But you you never like hear him howl, you know. It's like I mean I I've also got a soft spot for dogs. Like I like I'll you know, when they howl it is very cute and it's it he's just like trying to connect with him and meanwhile these tears are coming down and it's like Oh like it really, really got to me. And it's it still gets to me now, like when I see this scene. Yeah. I I don't know if this is a very popular pick though for like

Samuel
01:25:43
Final Fantasy 7 Yeah, but Aerith is so overdone, isn't it? That's the thing.

Lucy
01:25:47
It's so Yeah, a little bit.

Matthew
01:25:49
I I the thing that surprised me the most w uh when I played well in Helm I only played uh How many discs have I played? Two? One? I think you did one and a half, maybe, something like that. Yeah, I've done like one and a half discs a bit for this podcast. I will finish it eventually. Um and I do remember this scene. It's great, like it's it's it's like really well framed, it's such a striking image. Uh and you fully understand it. Like the thing that It not bothered me but surprised me the most was uh when uh when I played it was heir's death I find quite confusing as a scene. Like Like not just the logistics of it, but like what's actually going on and why why is it happening and I don't think the like that the sometimes the the writing in that game or the the the localization, you know, it feels like you're only getting like eighty percent of the picture maybe and Uh yeah I was quite surprised by how much that didn't do it for me when I played it. But uh I like this scene a lot.

Samuel
01:26:48
I think this would be better if someone spent two hundred million remaking it and added a load of minigames.

Matthew
01:26:54
I thought This would be so much better if those polygon tiers were 4K HDR ray traced tears. Oh, and also if Nanaky had a horrible voice.

Lucy
01:27:05
Oh no, that like switches halfway through.

Matthew
01:27:11
That's a gut punch.

Lucy
01:27:12
That this incredibly badass guy like

Samuel
01:27:15
Twist is he's lame. I agree. It's like the combination of uh sort of like imagination and Squaresoft's incredible artists with those, you know, those um static uh pre-rendered backgrounds. They're just They just made magic with them. Um I think it's a really good pick, Lucy, because it is less obvious, you know? Um yeah.

Lucy
01:27:41
Yeah, like I I also kind of wanted to quickly shout out the like Dine and Barrett scene as well in the original. Which is quite a a shocking you know, that's uh Marlene's dad, and you know, he's like, we can go see her, it's not too late, and he just gives up. And You know, I think when I was younger I didn't really understand what was going on there. As an adult revisiting it, it's like, wow, that is that's heavy. So when like rebirth came round, I I I was actually like saying, like, okay I'm actually really excited to see this how they're gonna handle uh like Dine and Barrett's like um, you know, friendship and now they're kinda like enemies, like what's gonna How's this gonna go down? And I really, really didn't like it. And I remember like the worst thing about it is like Right at the end, like d Dine, um I d I can't remember if he does commit suicide in this version or if he just gets killed. I really can't remember Um, but either way, like Barret is like suffering his loss. He's like, oh my god, like he's gone. And literally like someone's I think like Shinra are like after them again. And it's like, oh there's no time to grieve, quick get Barrett in the back of the car and let's get the hell out of here. Yeah, it just felt like so totally wrong. Like it And I think like that happened with the uh Red Thirteen scene as well. Like I think something happened with the Ghee immediately after the whole father scene and it was like no time here to like actually feel some emotion. Quick, we've got to deal with these ghosts.

Samuel
01:29:21
And it's like I don't even remember it in rebirth. That's uh that which I think says it's just gone from my memory, you know.

Lucy
01:29:28
Um yeah. Yeah.

Samuel
01:29:30
Classic. I love rebirth. That's fine, Matthew. Um enjoy your mini games. Enjoy your extraneous nonsense in the Shinra mansion.

Matthew
01:29:39
Um we we all wish you well. I just want to see those those two people slapping each other on top of that cannon. In 4K.

Lucy
01:29:46
That's that's true. I I am looking forward to how they handle it.

Samuel
01:29:49
I just know that that's gonna be incredible Uh yeah, that's gonna be like a very complicated QT minigame, that is. It's uh that's exactly what's gonna happen. Um okay, Matthew, what's your third pick?

Matthew
01:30:00
Bit of a bleak one after uh qu a poetic pick uh from Lucy there. Uh this is from Witcher Two and it's it's maybe more of a a very difficult like moral dilemma but I I remember very few choices in all the games I've played. Like it's very rare that a game can actually get me to sit back and think, hmm, what what should I do actually Um normally I just you know do the good option and it's it's all a bit basic. But in in The Witcher 2 there's uh i i the game famously splits at the start of the the second act into sort of two games and depending on who you ally with at the end of the first act you get You basically go on two differ different adventures and one of them brings you into the orbit of this uh king, King Hensalt um who is one of the many kings in that game that everyone's trying to assassinate. It's called the Assassins of Kings is his subtitle. And Geralt's whole deal is he's basically trying to stop people from assassinating kings. And as you sort of spend time with uh hensault you realise that he's just a massive piece of shit, um an incredibly awful bloke and uh a a character in that game who I really like called uh Vernon Vernon Roach Roach um not to be confused with Roach the horse a common error yeah uh Who I really like, he's like this shady kind of like sort of like almost like secret forces kind of military commander and all his little band of blue striped soldiers uh get killed by hen salt. uh and his sort of set female second in command is is uh sexually assaulted by hensult. It's it's pretty heavy stuff. It's quite Game of Thrones, like it's not a not a light jolly game at all and Um it it basically piles kind of crime upon crime upon Hensel and it it gets to the point where uh you have to sort of decide whether you're gonna kind of do something about him. And the decision of whether to to kill someone who is sort of morally reprehensible and has like deeply wounded people you love or you're close to anyway. And you know, really you're like you know, i it pumps you full of like vengeful hatred for this guy, but it also acknowledges that the destabilization of killing a king is gonna like wreck things and make life harder for everyone 'cause it's gonna mean the you know, this guy's it could bring quite a he's close to bringing an end to this this civil war. And if he dies, it's gonna drag on, so it's gonna affect many more people. And it's one of the only times where I've really sat there and and you know had to pause a game and and think about like Ah you know, what do I do here? You know, like do I let this guy go for the greater good, you know, or do I, you know, really he's he's been such a shit and I've seen it firsthand and sort of helped cover it up and uh I've like one of the few genuinely agonizing choices in a video game and and quite uh you know almost like a sort of a delayed gut punch because you know, whichever choice you make, it it feels very sort of sour and bitter, you know, there's no good answer to it. You either sort of really alienate your friend who wants vengeance, or you you know, basically pardon all these sins and uh it's uh yeah it's a really tricky one. But it's it's it's still what I think like I think just one of the the best bits of sort of dilemma construction in any game I've played. Um it's one of the few games where I have gone back and played like every branch of it just to see how all the different stories played out because I was so intrigued but that first time was very, very tough

Samuel
01:34:03
Yeah, it's um I think it's the prime candidate for a two giant men play episode, The Witcher Two. Um we talked about the idea of doing three over like multiple episodes as well, didn't we, Matthew? So Yeah. We do it and both go different directions at the second act. That sounds good. That might work. Is this one you're familiar with, Lucy?

Lucy
01:34:22
Unfortunately not. No, I haven't played the Witcher games.

Samuel
01:34:24
Oh well it's um uh Matthew's talked about it a few times and The idea of like having so much optional content tied up in this one choice is a really like compelling pitch to go back and play, I think. So um Yeah, I I always like hearing you talk about this Matthew. So Oh I like it.

Matthew
01:34:41
I know yeah, I've I've definitely talked about this like two or three times on the pod now, but uh It is good. He never in he's not really an important character. I don't think he's even in The Witcher Three, which is a bit of a bummer. He sort of slightly undermines it a little bit because you think, well, I've unleashed this guy, I've set him free, like he still exists in this world. Um but yeah, I never really sort of feel those repercussions like all the way through. But Yeah Oh well He probably died a horrible death, so that's fine.

Samuel
01:35:16
Coming to PS five in two years or something. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? Um Okay, uh my next one then, another quite obvious one, um, is knowing you're destined not to leave the planet in Halo Reach at the very end. Um so the whole game you know that you're going to lose. Um you already know the end was how they marketed this. Uh they may not be the exact words they used, but that was definitely the sentiment of the marketing. Like it was based on a novel by Eric Nyland that I didn't read but my old pal on X360 uh insisted was very good Halo Tire novel. Um and uh so yes when They finally did that story, uh, basically the the planet where they trained the Spartans of the Halo universe and where a lot of human beings live. Um but it unravels very, very quickly. They just find that their security defenses have been undermined, that the uh the that the um aliens are already there, that they um they're basically things are already looking dire from the off. It's uh a really quick kind of collapse of this planet. And um it's funny because I had a conversation about this game recently with someone where they said, I don't think the cutscenes are very good in this. And I thought this game was all about story, and I was like, well It is all about story, but actually a lot of it is in is outside the cutscenes. It's all in all about the vibes. It's all about the feeling that you're losing in each mission and the accumulative effect of that feeling. And that somehow matters more than the cutscene where you'll see like one of your um squad getting like sniped or whatever and then the emotional music kicks in. It's much the emotional impact of this game is I think is more effectively delivered through just the atmosphere and the the other the feeling of impending doom really. And so the very last moment of this game is that you are the ship that Starts the story in Halo Combat Evolve, the Pillar of Autumn, which lands on the Halo Ring and all the events that occur from there, unleashing the flood, etc. That ship is leaving the planet, but the um the uh fuck's sake, why have I forgot the Halo Aliens names, Matthew? Can you remember what they're called? Covenant. The Covenant, of course. The Covenant are are closing in on this ship and you know, you uh you know that there are you know the Master Team's on board basically and you know that you need to get these senior personnel out of there. And that tire the time is up for um Reach. And your character Noble Six is supposed to be on this ship as well. But your um your last remaining uh sort of comrade who's on this turret and meant to bring down this um covenant, this massive covenant cruiser that's basically stopping the Pillar of Autumn from escaping um into orbit, um, is killed and then you realize you have to abandon your place on this ship and therefore escaping the planet in order to bring this cruiser down, but you know the sacrifice is worth it in order for the Pillow of Autumn to get out there and for the for the fight against the Covenant to continue. And so that Again, partly delivered through cutscenes, partly delivered through gameplay, but then that that means that the pillar of autumn does escape, the ship is destroyed, but then your character is doomed, left there on the planet. And then this is conveyed in gameplay through, I think it just says survive or um something like that. And then you just fight endless waves of um of covenant until Your uh your helmet, uh the glass in the helmet cracks bit by bit until you fall in battle, and that's the that is the end of the game. Um and I think that's brilliant. I love a last stand in a game. Um it's actually quite similar to what Crisis Core does in its ending and I know I've talked about this game and this ending before. But I just think it's like the Um the best thing that Halo does with Story, apart from when um Captain Keys gets turned into alien an alien goo monster in um the original Halo. I love that shit, and Master Chief has to put his fist through his head and pull out his little his little chip. That was um that bit's awesome. Um but in terms of like actual you know, emotionality in the storytelling, this goes in. Um I Are either of you familiar with this?

Lucy
01:39:14
Uh no, unfortunately. But I I I guess like I'm Uh just imagining kind of like mass effect. I don't know if it's got that kind of feeling of like um you you feel very small, perhaps, like and powerless. Like d does it feel like that?

Samuel
01:39:34
Well it feels like you so you are you are a Spartan, you are a super soldier, but you the whole I think the whole thing with the fall of Reach is that just through sheer numbers you cannot win. Um and you kinda know that. And so you you kinda carry that knowledge with you that know ma no matter how hard you fight back, there will always be more of them to take down. And so I think in that respect it's definitely got some uh similarities but uh yeah.

Matthew
01:39:57
Yeah I I I like this. I ni and it's it's um it's weird like when you when you l you know look up you know, emotional gut punches or twists or bittersweet moments in games online. Like you get you do get loads of like list features and o of like more mainstream fair and and this is often in there but You know, and I don't mean this in a in a like condescending way, but I I do like that, you know, there were moments like this, you know, and you know, the stuff with Dom's wife in Gears of War, where y you know, you still see people, you know, quite traditional Capital G gamers talking about them as things that really got to them. and who maybe haven't played a lot of other things where there are, you know, more of these kind of stories going on. And I I do like that people were able to almost like smuggle some of this stuff in and get it get it past you know a crowd you know it it could be it could have just been quite sort of ooh you know military might um But I like that there were, you know, very, very mainstream games on, particularly on 360 that had kind of gave you a little bit of uh sort of emotional sustenance, I guess.

Samuel
01:41:18
And kind of like monocultural moments as well, where I think a lot of people uh something like the end of Metal Gear Solid 3 is one of those moments as well where a everyone has been exposed to that at some point and knows or at least knows what it is in you know, in the kind of abstract.

Matthew
01:41:33
So I just think it's I think it's easy to sometimes roll your eyes at That at those more mainstream examples when actually like it's just good. It's just good to have a bit of that in your diet, no matter how it gets to you, you know

Lucy
01:41:47
Yeah, I think it's really cool.

Samuel
01:41:49
Yeah, it's um it's uh I I think the execution is it's pretty great. I'm not really a big bungee storytelling kind of person. I couldn't tell you what happens in any of Destiny, but um They really yeah, they really landed the plane with um with that one. I think it still it still works because a lot of it is in the actual game part of it and not the cutscene part of it. Lucy, what's your next pick?

Lucy
01:42:11
Um let me see. Uh I will go with Lewis's story in What Remains of Edith Finch.

Samuel
01:42:20
You have to remind me which one Lewis is out of this vast family.

Lucy
01:42:25
So it's kind of towards the end of the game. This is the guy that works in the cannery and he chops head off

Matthew
01:42:32
f lots of I was thinking about this one.

Lucy
01:42:36
Yeah. So I actually I replayed Eda Finch um kind of recently within the like the last year or so. Because I really loved it the first time. Second time I felt very different about it, but that was quite interesting in itself that I, you know, had a different reaction. Um, but yeah, this is like a story that's maybe only like what five or ten minutes long if that like it's quite short but I think it's like a master in like game design because Uh in Eda Finch you go through all these like different rooms in this house and you find out like how each family member's like died and it's quite a you know a bleak kind of game. But this one in particular is I just think it's so like well crafted. So you do this like repetitive motion. He works in a cannery, um, he chops the head off like these fish and he and he just like chops it. moves a new one on, chops it, and you just and you do it on the controller and you just keep doing it. And then at like the side of the screen, this like um kind of dreamlike cloud appears. um and you see like what Lewis is imagining. And he's imagining like this little like character that looks like almost like a low poly final fantasy character. Uh like walking like Uh he's you know, he's gonna be knighted as a king and he's walking past all these crowds and suddenly you you're still like chopping the heads of the fish. uh but you start pushing like forward um and moving this character through this world and it's n it's got this narration over the top um of like saying like oh he's imagining himself to to be a king or whatever and the music is also like it swells into like trumpets and this like huge coronation affair. And meanwhile you keep chopping the the fish in the reality, but this like imaginary like dream bubble gets like bigger and bigger and pretty much like takes up the whole screen. to the point where you can't really see the fish anymore. And when he like eventually goes up, um To the throne to uh put the crown on his head, that's when he actually like chops his own head off and kind of commits suicide. And it's really like it I I think the first time I played it I was just really shocked. I was like, what the heck? was that because we've seen we obviously we we you know at this point we we know um this house is all about stories of death and and what's happened to all these people but some of them are a bit like almost a bit silly or a bit lighter hearted or whatever. But with this one, you when you go into um Lewis's room, you see like things around. Like I think there's a letter from a psychiatrist. that talks about what he's going through. Like I think he had a problem with substance abuse and he's like finally getting sober. But then it's like, oh you know, and well done. He's got a job at a cannery, he's holding down a a job. But he has like this kind of depression and this feeling of like this job isn't fulfilling me and this isn't like the life that I want and he he escapes into this fantasy world. And I just think like it's really powerful. Um And this is the scene that I was like reading up on it and the developers, I think, they said like they didn't really expect like this one in particular to like really make people cry or i i it wasn't, you know, exactly what they were going for, but I think it got a lot of reactions out of people. I think I've spoken to quite a few people about like this game and this is usually the one where people are like, that's the best story. Um I really want to know what these developers are doing now. Like I I can't believe we haven't really heard anything in all these years.

Samuel
01:46:56
Yeah, it's um I you know, I think this uh this is a game full of these kind of moments, but I think maybe just the the imagery and the contrast here is what really um really sticks with you. So yeah, great pick. And uh, you know, just uh uh absolutely kind of top of its form um game in terms of narrative design more generally. Um really good. Anything to add Matthew? Sure.

Matthew
01:47:19
Maybe it does land this particular one because so many of them are like accidents, like ridiculous accidents, where this is uh I uh n yeah, i in a bleak way this is something that's like more likely to happen to someone. A spiraling of something or you know, not being in sort of full control of something. And I don't know, maybe you can sort of it's e easier to imagine, you know, oneself into that situation. Uh yeah. I it's it's weird. It's one that I d like Almost not didn't it wasn't that I didn't like it, but you know, was you know, I I liked all the quite kind of jaunty, silly ones when I first played it. But when I think on it now I'm like, oh I th I think that that is one which had uh you know a bit more to say about, you know, just how how people are and how minds are and and you know, what can happen. to people.

Lucy
01:48:13
It felt it felt like um quite a good like c almost cautionary tale of like mental health issues. Um And you know, especially because he's male and, you know, a lot of men like don't seek help and things, like it it was it it felt like it it was saying a bit more than just being like this silly weird house. Yeah. Um It it felt like the real uh story in like all of them, I guess. Or at least like the one that yeah, that I I felt like I could relate to a little bit. And it it's quite scary.

Samuel
01:48:50
A little a little bit unnerving really. Alright then, well Matthew, we come to your next pick.

Matthew
01:48:56
I'm toying with I'm toying with changing one of mine on the fly just because I feel like it's I feel like it's a big it's a big it's just too big a s a spoil. It's just like here's the end of something. Um well until I have to make that difficult choice. Uh I'll talk about another difficult choice and I guess something which is kind of adjacent, although slightly lighter than than what happened in The Witcher 2. In Fable 2, there is a quest quite late in the game that culminates with you you're tricked into visiting something called the Shadow Court, uh by Reaver, who is the slightly sort of shitty guy that Stephen Fry voices. And The crux of it is a devil's bargain where where Reaver has been sacrificing people over the years for like a mortal youth. You know, he you know he never ages. But he brings victims to this this shadow court. You find yourself there with another of his intended victims and uh you know, the the the choice you basically have to make is, you know, who who is gonna sacrifice themselves to the Shadow Court, you or are you gonna let Reaver sacrifice this sort of, you know, innocent girl who wrong place, wrong time. I think this one's really effective and I may have mentioned this before on the podcast also, but what I really like about this particular choice uh in Fable 2 is that so much of their game and the character creation is about like carefully sculpting, you know, your reputation but also like your physicality, like you buy amazing clothes, like the way you eat changes your body. And I can't remember if the game like explicitly says what the Shadow Court's gonna do. I think they say they're gonna like age you or take your youth. And it plays on the vanity, which I think is naturally built into how you play Fable 2. If you're anything like I am, you know, I was very sort of I liked my character, I was very proud of my character, and actually the biggest thing you could threaten me with was I'm gonna I'm gonna wreck your character. I'm gonna m like make it ugly or I'm gonna do something to it, or we can do it to this this girl instead. I know I always think of this as one of the the best choices in games, just because I think it really found the stakes that made sense in this particular game. And I don't think many games do. I think they trade on quite abstract, like moral ideas, which i I I think are too grand for a lot of us to really think too deeply on. You know, we're all like, oh of course I'm like pro helping people and, you know, anti you know, destroying loads of people. Um but for them to say, well, do you want to be ugly or not? This character. Now maybe that's a really shallow read and no one else feels this when they get to this quest. But that's how I felt about it. And I've I felt I mean not distraught, but let's say I was genuinely put out that my character was uh mangled by the Shadow Court and I felt like I really like you know took one for the team in that game which is uh I don't know, does that make me a shallow person? I don't know.

Samuel
01:52:11
Well it's an interesting choice to give the player. Might more generally because it does test your vanity, which is a good I think a good thing to do with like video game storytelling because It's a real part of human life, right? And so if you're roleplaying it's like uh it's a key part of how you perceive your character, it's how you look, because yeah, it's uh i i it's it's uh it's a silent character. And you are invested in in that character. So yeah, I think it's um perfectly okay to have that response, Matthew. I think most people probably had some reaction along those lines too. Um did you play Fable 2, Lucy?

Lucy
01:52:50
No. Uh I know my husband is a big like fan of the Fable games and he's always like, you need to play it. So yeah, this this sounds really interesting to me. Like I don't think I've seen a choice like that in a game. So I'm gonna have to check it out.

Samuel
01:53:04
Oh okay. Um then my penultimate pick is uh the end of Link's Awakening. There's your spoiler alert, um, if you haven't played this game by now, but it's over thirty years old, so I imagine um most people have had the opportunity if they were going to. Um I think this is definitely in the f in the first sort of like wave of games that had any kind of impact on me emotionally. I imagine that's true for a lot of people because I'm sure a lot of kids had Game Boys um in the 90s and they ended up with this game, and it is one of the few Game Boy games that really has a pronounced story element. And There are many hints that what is going on in the game, the location you're on is not maybe what it seems. Um it and so there are there are suggestions that you're perhaps in some a dream of some kind. And then at the very end of the game, as you wake up the uh the windfish, this big creature with a weird um gurning face that on Game Boy Color looks particularly trippy with what they did with the colours there. Um flies away and the um Cahollin Island and where you had your we spent your adventure um disappears along with everyone on it. um including um uh Marion and Tarin, um basically your uh your uh love interest quote unquote or rather your companion in the game. And a man who just looks like Mario and basically is Mario, who is also there. And lots of um animal friends as well and other um interesting weird beings who you encounter. Um I think it's very effective just because um you have why didn't I write it down? Is it Marin's theme? Matthew, what is the Marin's little tune that she sings? You're the big Zelda guy. Zelda mastermind not knowing any of the question answers. I think it's just Marin's song. I think that's song. Ballad of the Windfish, that's it. Ballad of the Windfish, that's it, of course. Um, because it's the piece of music that plays on every instrument once you've got um you've completed a dungeon. Yeah, so Ballad of the Windfish. Whew, thank god Um slick. Um so yeah, it and so the idea of the game ending with this track that you've heard throughout, it's just a really good little motif of, you know, hanging every emotional moment around this and then yeah, they all kind of it kind of fades to white, everyone just disappears. It's very sad. I think this is very effective personally, considering what the uh developers were working with. That said, there is a final um shot of Linking Link looking quite delighted as the windfish flies over his head So maybe I was more invested in Marion than he was. But uh such as it is, he's like, Oh, I could go back to my real girlfriend now, Princess Zelda. Maybe he was thinking that, I don't know. Um, Lucy, I don't know if you played this or have a take on this one

Lucy
01:55:40
No, I'm sorry. I'm not the biggest like Zelda fan. Um but I I have seen this is the one that they remade, right? Uh with the really cute art style. Yeah, so I watched my husband play this and I I think I did see this ending. Um, and that little tune that always plays is really nice. I like um I like it when like you know, a a musical motif can come back and like trigger a bit of a memory and make it more emotional. Um yeah, it's I I really actually um I do want to play like the remake of it myself because I really love that art style. I it's such a cute little world and you know, as someone who doesn't play many Zelda games, like it's so strange like how it has like Mario like things in it as well. That just seems so strange to me.

Samuel
01:56:34
Uh well n none of that occurred to me when I first played it. I didn't even think about it. I just thought oh it's just a man a man with a mustache called Marin. Don't don't think about it too much. Um yeah. Or is it Tarin? Fuck, I've forgotten the names of the characters, this is going going badly, I'll cut this bit out. Um yeah, so it's um I think what added to it for me was that I first played this game when I was ten and then I finished this game in uh twenty thirteen on three DS. So um I would have been uh twenty-eight at that point. Is that right? Oh god I done my maths correctly there I don't think I have actually um twenty-five I was twenty-five at that time So quite a big time difference there. But obviously the piece of music I was very familiar with um from from being a kid. So it actually like heightened the effect of when the character just do disappear and you do hear that music for the last time, it's like, wow, there's actually a decade and a half journey it took me to get here. And it's a game I treasure a lot. So um there it is. Um Lucy, what's your final moment?

Lucy
01:57:31
Yeah, um Make it a good one. I think I ha I maybe have saved the best till last.

Matthew
01:57:38
Big ugly cry for the finale.

Lucy
01:57:40
Yeah. This is um The death of Lee at the end of The Walking Dead season one. Ugh. Which I guessing you guys have played.

Samuel
01:57:52
Yeah. Yeah. I have indeed it's like it's the last thing I've ever seen of this entire series because I never went back to it.

Lucy
01:57:57
Same, same. Uh well to to be honest, I am not a zombie. Like I I don't really like horror games. I definitely don't like zombies. And I didn't play this when it came out for that reason. However, um my husband really likes it and he's like, you love narrative games, you really need to play this. So we played it together and I really got into it. I did play um is it the Wolf Among Us? Um that Telltale did. And I really liked that, so I was like, okay, I'll I'll try this. Um and You, you know, over the course of the game, uh, Lee meets Clementine, looks after her. I think their relationship is really sweet, it's really well done um really touching. Again, I think this is one where the voice acting carries a lot of the weight for me. Um and, you know, he gets um bitten. I think uh you know, a a good kind of like couple of hours before the game ends. So you know it's coming. Um But you're like uh at least for me, I I was like in denial, like no, like he's he's not he's not gonna turn, he can't, he's like the protagonist, he's a great character, like you can't do this Um, so you're kind of like trying to come to grips with it and you know, Clementine doesn't know yet and and then, you know, eventually she she finds out and he he gets really sick and this is when he kinda gives her the gun and is like, You have to shoot me so you don't see me like that. You know it's gonna happen and it's such a a heavy choice to put on this little girl. Um because it's like if I I think I made the choice where you give her the gun and you tell her to shoot. Because at least she's in control of it. But if she like sees him turn and all that, that just that was just like too devastating for me. I didn't I didn't want to see see him like that either. But it doesn't just end there, you know, it keeps going. It's like, oh you can like say your final like words to her, like keep that hair short, or I'll miss you. and all these things and it's like it's so oh it's just so emotional. Um I was a I was a meh after after this I just like couldn't do anything like the rest of the day. Um and you know Lee Like, it's this thing, like, Lee is like, even as he's like really sick and he's about to turn, like, he's still looking after her and telling her to be brave and putting her first. And it's just so sweet. And I I think this is like it's it's quite a co common pick 'cause I know a lot of people like this got to them Um, but it, you know, I it got it really got to me too, and I think it was really, really well done. Um you know, no one is like black and white in this game. Like everyone's like very human and and like has their flaws but also like, you know, the great things about them. And um, you know, Lee is like um He's like a convicted criminal, I think. Is that how the game starts? Um But then like over the you know the course of the game you see that he's very kind, he's strong, and he's loving, and it's just so Nice. So it just feels like such a cruel cruel ending. Yeah, destroyed me.

Samuel
02:01:43
What I always think of with this game is it shouldn't have worked as well as it did because it was a a tie-in to a comic book slash TV show that was blowing up at the time. And um uh you know, it was so enormous that you would think that the source material would overpower it somewhat because they're kind of telling a a knockoff quote unquote story in this universe. But they uh create such rich characters and I I really love what I love about the last episode is they hinge um uh hinge the whole story on like one choice, desperate choice you made later on that involved an innocent party, but you didn't know who who you were affecting when you made that choice. And so the idea of it coming back around in the way that it does is is a great bit of like post-apocalyptic storytelling where it's not about the zombies, it's the the ethos of the Walking Dead that I thought the show just r rarely sort of adhered to, which was the idea of like human drama and the way humans behave being the real um sort of dramatic tension of the of every story that's told in that universe. And I think this game encomp encompasses that better than most seasons of that TV show did, at least the ones that I saw. Um so yeah, the it it working as well as it did was like lightning in a bottle, really. And um You know, it seems like they never quite reach those heights again, but you know, it's uh it's really that's because the the standard was unbelievably high in this first season. Do you have thoughts on this one, Matthew?

Matthew
02:03:11
Something that this game has that none of the subsequent ones do. The the whole choices system, but also, you know, the now much made fun of, so and so will remember this. And I think what actually happens across the course of this game, certainly by the end of it, you know, you you realise that it's it this this first Walking Dead season, you know, it is about the creation of another character, Clementine through your actions, like how she sees you, how you carry yourself and how that rubs off on her and actually I think at right at the end and and the way it in it almost has to end this way 'cause I think you you do realise that i i is all a game about did you kinda like leave a good mark, did you make it you know, were you a good influence, did you you know on on on, you know, whoever comes next or whatever comes next and I think without that uh that that sort of so and so will remember this never quite has the same kind of hook to it or ring to it. It just becomes a bit of a a bit of a meme where yeah I yeah I thought I thought this was absolutely brilliant. I was quite resistant to it because I thought there's no way this can be good. And uh I was quite snobby about the people who were liking this at the time, like the positive reviews. I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know. Um uh and yeah, and then you'll you play it and you're like, ah, it's just br that's just brilliantly Brilliantly structured and observed and a hard genre to do fresh things in as well. It's so played out the zombie thing, but I uh yeah, it's great. Well, um we come to your final pick, Matthew. Uh I was gonna talk about the ending of Xenoblade 3, but I feel like do it Yeah.

Lucy
02:04:55
I say that I've I've only seen it. I haven't played it.

Matthew
02:05:00
It's j it is just such a massive spoiler.

Lucy
02:05:02
Yeah. It is though, isn't it?

Matthew
02:05:05
F for what that for what that game is. But well I'll I'll do it anyway. Uh you can skip ahead a couple of minutes. I'll I'll skip over some of the very specifics of it, but The whole game's about these two warring armies, like this perpetual kind of like never-ending sort of war, almost like two nations bred to fight each other. and three characters from each army uh end up banding into a team of six. And so the whole time you think Uh this is gonna be quite a cliched story about soldiers from opposite sides of a borders realising the humanity and one another and all this, but they actually I think they get to that quite quickly and they kind of get over that quite quickly and Um what what the story does reveal itself to be, you know, which is the very spoilery stuff I'm afraid, is that The world they live in is the two previous worlds of Xenoblade 1 and Xenoblade 2 have kind of merged together through various The narrative contrivances and their their state of being together is is what's going to be um apocalyptic or rather they're they're held in this sort of never ending loop by some sort of insane god who you have to kill in space. Um as it as it should be. But uh the I I guess the th the the realization comes at the end, you know, they fix the problem and they separate the worlds and it takes everyone fr you know basically stays in their their original world. So this party of six who are incredibly bonded, great friends, some of them romantically uh you know entwined. um they start like running towards each other as as you know literally sort of reality rips into two universes like never to be together again and it's it's just a really tragic outcome when you've spent, you know, a hundred plus hours helping these people get to this situation and then you sort of realize you've you've sort of knobbled them all in in the process of of fixing the world and just that image of them Not in a sad way, in a kind of triumphant way. They're like, well, we're never gonna give up. You know, we're s we're always gonna be here and we're gonna find each other somehow. And they they sort of run towards each other and you just sort of see it all kind of pulling apart and I just thought oh really depressing uh having spent time with all these characters almost so sort of final I can't really imagine as Enerblade 4. I certainly don't really want to see them try and fix this, you know, or I I can't really imagine that. Um You know, I think that would that would sort of undermine, you know, what they what they did with in this game. But um yeah, you know, they must be working on something. So

Lucy
02:07:49
Xenoblade 3. What a bomber. Well, I I remember seeing that scene because my husband is a huge Xenoblade fan. And I've you know I've watched him kind of play all of them and I I'm not sure I quite get it. But with three with three I think it seemed it had a bit of a slightly different tone about it and I it really piqued my interest. I was like, okay, this this series actually you know, it's got the chops kind of thing. Like I I'm really quite interested in this. I think it had a really nice cast of characters and the it it has like a love story in three and seeing that scene at the end where they're like being split apart. I I even I remember l like how like vivid that that is. Um and I got kind of really invested in it by the end. Um However, uh am I am I correct in thinking this is around this point you also see this photo from Xenoblade 2? Yeah.

Samuel
02:09:06
What's this?

Matthew
02:09:07
What's this?

Samuel
02:09:07
Well Is it one of the booby characters from the second one?

Matthew
02:09:12
Because it it turns out that the world kind of is the worlds of one and two. It can have some sort of throwback like some characters from Xenoblade 1 and Xenoblade 2 turn up. And it denies you seeing a lot of the characters, but you do see this photo of I can't remember the specifics of it now, but It it I think it suggests that like the character and correct me if I'm wrong here, I think it suggests the character from Center Blade 2 has basically started a family with like several is it several women?

Lucy
02:09:46
Uh yeah, I know I know it's like is it Mithra and

Matthew
02:09:52
The two yeah, they're sort of different sides of it.

Lucy
02:09:55
I don't know if um I forget the name of the cat girl, I don't know if she's involved in this as well or not. But it was just a bit of a shock, like wait, wait what?

Samuel
02:10:04
Is that p polyamory in a Nintendo game?

Matthew
02:10:07
I think we only see it very briefly and I think the implication of the photo is that he he's definitely impregnated like a lot of the party from the second game. Wow. Well that woke me up. Wow. Which is why have we never talked about this before? It can be interpreted in lots of different ways

Samuel
02:10:27
Wow, polyamory in a Nintendo game.

Matthew
02:10:30
You're like, alright, that's what happened at the NSP. Fair enough. That's it. Yeah, that's how I read it too, but I haven't studied it.

Samuel
02:10:42
I'm sure it makes sense. Okay, my last pick then. Um I'm gonna be much more circumspect here, um, because I'd still this is another game that people have more people should play. Um so Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy has I'd say two Character deaths, one in the present and one in flashback that really drive the story. Um and and really are kind of the heart of what the story is. And I think that successfully separates it from the films which definitely inform the tone of what Iidos Montreal made with Guardians of the Galaxy, but you know, it de uh the game is long enough and has enough of its own kind of stories to tell that it manages to successfully separate itself from that interpretation of the characters. So by the end of it you have a your own relationship with th this particular version of Peter Quill, uh Gamora, Drax, Rocket Raccoon. and Groot, um characters who may have felt a little bit overplayed or you might have been bored off by the time that this game came around and I think I felt that a little bit. I probably, you know, superhero fatigue definitely kicking in around twenty twenty one, twenty twenty two time, when it turned out that most of these films were just bad, and it was um it was all going a bit wrong in the MCU. Apart from our beloved Eternals, Matthew. And um yeah, so I think that this game is uh is it's successfully about you know, uses grief as a theme. And you don't really know why you're getting all of these flashbacks until uh with the young Peter Quill kinda like hanging out in his room, a classic sort of eighties kid in terms of the his posters and his toys and the stuff that he owns and then um the context sort of like really comes together and how that connects to the modern uh the the story in the um in The present day in the game, um, I think it's very elegant uh as a bit of like blockbuster game storytelling. And you know, I I don't think everything that the story does lands in exactly the same way. Um it definitely t but it definitely takes some big swings and this is one of them. But it's the idea of like They're quite quiet deaths really. Um just in terms of like they're not really huge battles where these moments happen. If that like one of the deaths happens off screen. And I just think it's unusually it just feels very personal, the storytelling. It feels like the restraint that's got into it just feels like it comes from a very human place. Uh I was just very impressed by it, so wanted a shout out as we end. I know I'm always banging on about how good this game is, but um I'm very fond of it and it's always in a Steam sale um of some kind. Um Lucy, have you played this one at all?

Lucy
02:13:29
No, I've not. Um yeah, I'm I've I think I've had the kind of superhero fatigue for quite a long time. Um But uh I did think this game did look pretty cool and I was quite interested in checking it out, so I might do that if it's in a sale coming up

Matthew
02:13:49
It is good. It is good. Uh it has like quite a hard sort of has to exist in the shadow of those films in a way which is quite unfair and if anything if I think it forces them to make some of their own kind of choices, uh, you know, in c in quite interesting ways. It sort of zigs where those films would zag and uh it's probably why it does resonate.

Samuel
02:14:10
Yeah, it's a bummer reading that their studios made layouts in last week and I just I feel a little bit uncertain about the future of Idols Mont Montreal even though they made three. really fucking great blockbuster games in a row and it's just a a sign of the times we're in um sadly that They are not in a position where they can m do their best work, um, where all the people who made those amazing games um can have jobs in the industry. It's bleak for sure. Um yes, emotional gut punch. That is the games industry in 2025. That's the final one. What a twist. Well that's uh that is our list. Um I won't recap them all there, um 'cause there are too many of them. But um I will include them in the post on patreon. com slash.

Matthew
02:14:55
And you can vote who had the most emotionally distraught list.

Samuel
02:15:00
Um yes, um so I will put all those so you can you can read that freely even if you're not, you don't have to pay to read that. You can just go read that at patreon. com slash batpage pod And I'll thank you for your time, Lucy, and ask where people can find you on social media and where people can check out your games.

Lucy
02:15:14
Yeah. So thanks for having me guys. Um you can find me on uh blue sky is probably the best place. Uh I'm just Kinmoku. Um or if you wanna check out my games My website is kinmoku. games and I also have a newsletter on there. Sometimes I do like giveaways and things like that. So please sign up because Social media media is like so fragmented. I th I find like the newsletter is the best place to like not miss like what's going on.

Samuel
02:15:46
Yeah, that's awesome. I mean yeah, I think you're you're a great follow on uh social media, you know, as well as posting about your own games, you Uh definitely like repost or post about interesting bits and pieces. So um yes, I'll I'll t I'll include you. Samuel Roberts endorsed. Um not in my mute list. It's really the best endorsement I can up for these days. So um yes, um Um Matthew, where can people get you on social media?

Matthew
02:16:12
Uh I am at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. So I really enjoyed doing this episode. Thank you, Lucy. This was good fun.

Lucy
02:16:19
Oh cool.

Samuel
02:16:20
I realize it's taken up a lot of your evening, Lucy, so I really appreciate it.

Lucy
02:16:23
Oh, it's fine. I I just thought it would be something a little bit different and uh it was really interesting, like, hearing about all the picks and I think as a whole we've all had a a really wide variety of different games, so it's been really cool.

Samuel
02:16:38
Fighting back tears as I remember the death of Jarotopal. It's uh it's uh I'm only joking, I don't I didn't cry at that, but uh you know. So Well it's sad to watch a big purple man fall. It's just tough out there, you know. Um Where was I? I'm I'm Samuel W. Roberts on social media. The podcast is at Backpage Pod. If you'd like two additional podcasts a month, you can support us at the Patreon link I already mentioned. Um something for Spotify listeners actually is that we've merged our two feeds into one. So If you are subscribed on Patreon, you can link your profile on Spotify, your Patreon profile, and you'll see all the episodes in one big list on the main feed. You don't need a separate one anymore It's created some minor technical headaches behind the scenes, but um in general it seems like it works fairly well. And uh yeah, but otherwise um that's us done for now. We'll be back next week with the alternate game of the year awards. And uh I'll thank Lucy for her time again and say goodbye. Goodbye.

Matthew
02:17:38
Goodbye. Bye. And

Samuel
02:18:17
Hello, Samuel here of the Two Giant Men from the Backpage Podcast. So, this bit of audio here that I'm going to play after the uh the credits music. We don't really have credits, do we? But after the music is played. Um I cut from the episode originally when I was editing it because it was like two hours and forty-eight minutes or something, the MP3, which is far too long for a regular episode. Um but the cold light of day, I actually thought this bit of audio was pretty good. It's a discussion of some of the other um bits from the first half of the episode of uh sort of like blockbuster games and the ways in which they try to generate an emotional response from players. And even though it's after the fact and the episode's already gone out. I thought I would swap the MP3 and put in put in a sort of director's cut version that has this audio at the end. Just for posterity really. Um because it's a good little discussion and There's some talk about an indie game that came out this year that myself and Matthew haven't really discussed before. So enjoy. Yeah, I I this was the last thing I was going to ask before we got into the picks really was whether Blockbuster games are as preoccupied with this and getting this kind of response as they used to be. I feel like That for Japanese developers, they started experimenting with storytelling that could get those kind of emotional responses from you in the Snares era and then PS1, PS2. Um there there are sort of many more games that are able to to that aspire to do that kind of thing. And then I think it happens more with for Western developers somewhere in the 360 era where the quality of cutscenes and animations and cinematic presentation is high enough that they feel like they can take some big swings. So I'm talking about your the death of Dom in um Gears of War, for example, or um or like the the choices you make to harvest or spare the the little sisters in Bioshock and the resulting fallout from that. Um very much the kind of expressions of the characters are a a key part of uh you know how the game challenges you emotionally. Do you feel good or bad about doing that kind of thing? But also just some of the big moments that occur in the HD era Call of Duties, like the nuke going off in Modern Warfare, for example. um spoiling games all over the shop here, but most of them are quite old. Or just some of the things that GTA four does, like the marked difference, Matthew, between GTA four and San Andreas in terms of the storytelling and what they aspire to achieve. just speaks to like a lot of developers in the late noughties in the West thinking, I think we can do more emotional storytellings now. I think we are I think we can be movies. I think that drives a lot of the types of games to get made at that time. I was curious for your perspective on this, Lucy. What what what do you think?

Lucy
02:21:00
Yeah, I mean that's really interesting because like personally, like I don't At least these days, I don't play that many um kind of blockbuster or like AAA games. It's quite rare for me. Um Like I I'm much more like playing like indie games or like smaller smaller budget games. Um but I I do think you're kind of onto something a little bit because I I think, you know, when the PlayStation 2 era when we were starting to get graphics that actually look like people, I think that was a big point of like let's start getting real emotions out of people. Like I'm thinking about like Metal Gear, like Solid 3. Um, you know, that is a very like um emotional game like towards the end. And you know, it was like we can finally start being taken seriously in doing these kind of things. Um whereas now I think I I I feel like you have to kind of rely on an indie game for that almost. But that that might just be me because I don't have as much like experience with with bigger games. Um I think maybe like there's there's something about Indies I think they they're a bit more um They're like they'll focus on a precise thing, um, like a certain emotion. Like I I played a game called Wednesdays, which is very um It's very heavy, uh, because it's about sexual assault, which is a very difficult topic Um but it was a master of like delivering that game in a way that made it easy to actually like play through. So Yeah, like at least for me if I'm if I'm trying to like uh you know get some you know, go in for an emotional experience. I will look at indie games. I also heard uh there's a game called And And Roger, I think it's called, which is another one that's meant to be like, you you know, you're gonna cry at the end of this. And I'm at this point now where I'm like, I think I've cried enough this year. Like I I don't I don't think I can I can play it. Um I and I do really want to see what it's about, but yeah, like I've I've just been like playing dispatch instead, like oh let let's let's play like a superhero thing and like just have a bit of a laugh instead.

Matthew
02:23:36
I can guarantee you you will not cry in Donkey Kong Bonanza. That is that is a pledge.

Lucy
02:23:44
That's what I need.

Samuel
02:23:45
I I think that's you know definitely indie games explore that space more. I think it's true to say it's become less of a battleground for blockbuster games than it used to be, but they definitely still try and do these moments. Um I won't spoil them, but you know, Final Fantasy 16 Has a big moment like this, um, you know, like a a major uh sort of turning point in the story and um a key moment for a character that is definitely kind of reaching for the for a similar sort of thing. I've not played Boulder Skate 3 Matthew, I imagine that's got a few. But like Cyberpunk Definitely does. Um it's uh you know, both in terms of the side quests that involve companions trying to elicit a response from you and also just like um fairly early character death that drives the story as well. Um though neither of those things really like massively click with me. Weirdly I got more emotional about um Johnny reuniting his band in Cyberpunk than any of the actual like character deaths or like moments. But Um that just might be because it it felt a little bit less forced than some of those other moments. But um what do you think, Matthew, about my my thesis there about the 360 era was kind of a peak of people trying to do this sort of thing?

Matthew
02:24:54
Maybe trying like intentionally, you know, that kind of process we were talking about earlier being not hugely successful, like you set out to be profound or or um E you know, have something important to say where actually I think if you call it on that front and you don't chase it as much. I think you are more likely to to do it by accident. Like th I thought you said about Cyberpunk, like I absolutely agree. I think all the the the moments which are really meant to land and be like the the huge motivators for for your character and for you. None of them really did it for me. But actually I thought there was, you know, m more truth in um uh whatever her name was, the lady ran the bar, kind of like seeing Johnny's car again after all these years and just like made a sort of wistful sigh or she a a kind of a uh there's like a little laugh she s she does when she sees the car and she's like, you know, a teenager again and I just thought, well that's I th I thought there's more in that and th that's more m emotionally affecting to me than than like the other hundred hours of Cyberpunk. But I I doubt that anyone, like, set out to achieve that specific thing, you know, w when making that game. I So You know, I kind of I don't know, I kinda like the area we're in. I feel like it can happen more often.

Samuel
02:26:13
I think these things can just sort of, you know, unfold as they're meant to and Yeah. I you know, I think that the point about, you know, the sort of indie games carrying this is a is a key thing, but I think that I actually really respect it when a game doesn't uh doesn't swing too hard to create this response from players but or but puts you in a a headspace where you you definitely feel something but it's not it's not uh you can you don't feel the game prickling at you to get that kind of response. So um the game Despilotte that came out this year about um playing football in like the two thousands and basically being a teenager in a small town where your parents have certain expectations of you, but was really a sort of a slice of life game about why football mattered so much to this one kid and the way that it shaped his whole life. I really like that because I think it would have been really easy to be like it's act two, the dad's dead, and now your whole life has changed. But it's really just much more like It reminded me of what it was like being a teenager in 2002 and watching Ronaldinho lob David Seaman. And um and f being so invested in football that it felt really important when England um crashed out of that tournament and obviously it being uh uh the the guy uh being a millennial or similar age to me that also created a m uh you know i it was just I was able to inhabit the headspace perfectly and It captured the feeling of having a knockabout in the park, which was a very recognisable experience to me, perhaps less so to you, Matthew.

Matthew
02:27:49
Um even though I don't have that relationship with football. I still felt that play in that game, you know? And you were like Yes it's real. Yeah, and and you were like, Oh, this really, really matters. understand if if anything, it made me feel a bit sort of jealous that it wasn't part of my life, you know? I was like, oh man, that must be nice. Um Yeah.

Samuel
02:28:17
And It r it was exactly what I had yeah, I I used to have these two little mates and we had this little patch of grass we played football on and we did that for about I think four years and we all every Saturday we sat on this bench where people had scratched these names into the bench. One was like Mike, one was Dan, one was Bob or something. And We all sat in our different places. It was agreed that I was Bob and this other guy was Dan. And um there was a sign that said no ball games and we kicked the ball against that sign endlessly. And some of the neighbours were annoyed that we were there. Sometimes the ball would go over the fence and we'd have to break into Ministry of Defence property in order to get our football back. You sure this wasn't a video game? No, this is what um 'cause I'm from Gossport in Hampshire, it's got a bit of um the old secret military base thing going on around there. It's a it's um it's All of this did happen, I assure you. But it's um but but basically it's it's so precise in its rendering of what it was like to play football. with you know, with your mates at that time and to feel the hours and a day disappear. That I was just really impressed by it without it ever having to resort to doing something. really like uh traditionally you know uh a traditional narrative beat to get that response, you know. So yeah. I don't know if you played that one, Lucy. Was that a game you were gonna check out this year?

Lucy
02:29:37
It is one I'm Planning on checking out. I still haven't got round to it though. Um I think it's just been getting like kind of pushed down my list just because I'm not a football fan. But I I've heard so much good stuff about it. Like y it's like you don't even need to be. Like it's not it's not really about that. So I'm really intrigued to play it.

Matthew
02:29:55
Yeah.

Samuel
02:29:56
Yeah. I don't really know much about, you know, Ecuador either. And it's so it and like to me, Ecuador's football team is just one of the like lower star teams you'd see in an old FIFA game on PS1 or something. So And but the idea of it being your everything and inhabiting that perspective, it's um it's really good, but I can totally see why it'd be drowned out a little bit this year.

Matthew
02:30:18
It also has a cast of NPCs who are slightly annoyed by football. And like the presence of football and like a boy kicking a football and now that now that I can empathize with.
