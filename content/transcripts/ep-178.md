Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, once again, we melt in the summer sun. Even though it's meant to be fucking spring, I'm already dying in my flat. It is Monday evening.
I've had some, I think they're called teriyaki pops from the Wasabi Ranger Sainsbury's.
I refuse to eat anything with the word pops in it, apart from popcorn.
I almost said poppers, and I realized that's something else. That's not what this is. But yes, I've had those.
They're something like 400% of my daily salt allowance in there. So did that, drank half a gallon of water, and now here I am ready to go on another mailbag. To kick us off, we should talk a bit about how the game soundtrack's draft has gone down.
It seems like it's been a pretty big success. People seem quite engaged with it. How have you found the whole response to it?
Yeah, I'm glad that people are engaging with it, because it means that they're listening to it, and it was quite a chunky podcast. Despite stating several times over how subjective it was, you still had people going, oh, well, yeah, well, I would clearly have included this, you know, this thing. And certain, like...
There were certain genres which we definitely give less of a fuck about, which people have really focused in on, which is quite frustrating. Like, there seems to be, I'd say like 50% of discussion has revolved around the fighting genre. I'd say a genre well established on this podcast to be of no interest to me and only moderate interest to you.
So the idea that people were going to get an incredibly in-depth breakdown of all the fighting game soundtracks, it's just very unlikely. Haven't you listened to the other hundred and something episodes of this podcast? Like, you know what we're like, right?
It's tricky because I understand that people want to, you know, hear us be as eloquent as we are about Hotel Dusk and Halo 3, about all the things that they like. And the problem with games is they're so long or detailed that it's not like watching a whole genre of film or just swatting up on the films of Scorsese. That's something you can do in like a week at a push.
With games, you're talking like a months-long project for us to understand what fighting games are. While we do that, we won't be talking about anything else.
We just have to embrace our limitations a little bit, I think.
Yeah, but at the same time, you don't want to go, well, we're not going to include the genre or never acknowledge that it exists. But by acknowledging it exists, all of a sudden you get these people leaning back, crossing their arms. It's like, come on, man, impress me.
And you're like, well, we're not going to do that. I'd rather not talk about it outright or not acknowledge that it exists than face people being sniffy when you've got like, you know, outside of that, 38 other soundtrack picks.
Yeah, but I think you find that none of those matter when one person picks the We Shop Channel music, Matthew, and that erases all other picks.
And that was the other half of the discussion. So half of it was people going, oh, they don't know a lot about fighting games. And the other half was people going, lol, We Shop overwrites it.
And you're like, well, actually, I'd rather you picked because of the breadth of the selections. We just make this incredibly cursed format that brings out the worst in everyone.
Including us. The worst thing about it is that it kind of made me think, well, why do the other categories of people are just going to pick the novelty ones? You know what I mean?
We talked about this over text. You were like, well, the novelty ones are kind of needed for an entertainment factor in the draft, but they do overpower the rest of the draft. And so no one gives a shit if you picked a good battle theme because you picked, like, Randy Newman.
And it's tricky. I don't know what to do about that other than punish the listeners by taking the novelty categories out so they are forced to be on the street and narrow with how they vote, which seems like a bit totalitarian for a fun podcast format, or just give up doing them. I don't really know.
There's no good solution, really. It's a tricky one. Yeah.
But hey, shout out Randy Newman. Killing it in both the poll and also my game of Dragon's Dogma 2. I've had to bring him back in, listeners.
People who heard our What We've Been Playing episode on Dragon's Dogma 2 a couple of months ago, I've been getting properly into Dragon's Dogma 2 again. It's interesting because I didn't realize this was kind of a game of two halves. The first half is very much in this leafy sort of area.
The second half is in this desert area. And in the desert area, the enemies are much harder. And I was a bit sick of Matthew's sort of curly haired avatar, who we've established before looks a little bit like Jeremy Peel, you know, the sometime third host of this podcast.
And I had dismissed him for a while because I had found this like this new sort of mage lady. And I thought, oh, she's pretty good. And while she's sort of healing us, I can get Douglas, my lion guy, to like learn a new subclass.
It was all going well. Then I got to Patal and got absolutely fucking rinsed on the road to like the first tavern, basically. It was just just it was me.
And then like I watched Ian Dixon's chuckle brother just get annihilated by some flying bastard. And then just like just like limped to the save point. And then I was like, I need I need Randy Newman.
And that's the position I'm in now. How do you find that turn of events, Matthew?
I mean, fine, because he was he not there for you in your time of need? He's non-judgmental, just always willing, always enthusiastic. That's my that's my Randy.
He always knows where things are. Only one time is he gone. I shall have to tell my master about this when I found one of those little coin things in a well or whatever.
But everything else he's like, I don't know what this is, obviously, as previously established.
So the worst thing not to go down a huge Dragon's Dogma 2 avenue, but there's a side quest, which I won't spoil for you in case you haven't discovered it, because it's quite cool, where you get given riddles to solve, and each of the riddles gives you something quite special in return. But one of the riddles, they say the solution to this riddle is where you found your first Seekers token.
Right.
And I fucking don't remember where I found my first Seekers token. It's like going, do you remember something you did 30 hours ago? But it's there and it's timed, so it's only there for seven days.
That seems quite bad, because mine was in just some fucking cave somewhere.
Well, at least you remember a cave.
Yeah, but there are so many caves in that game. How will I ever find it?
I remember there being grass, you know. But then I'm like, was it in a cave entrance? Was it on a cliffside?
Like, I just have not, I will never be able to do that quest. I'll have to do a new game plus. Collect my first Seeker's Token and mark it on the map, especially to go back and get it.
An incredibly fear-eating side quest.
I mean, this is a game that asks, what if half of our side quests were the Zodiac spear thing in Final Fantasy XII where you fucked it without ever realising you'd even started it? That's basically what happens in a lot of these quests. Some of them are quite good for course correcting.
If you lose a certain item for something, it might unlock later. But there are also some where it's just like, what the fuck, man? I'm not surprised to hear that.
But yeah, in any case, Matthew, I think we'll probably talk about Dragon's Dogma 2 a tiny bit very shortly because this is a mailbag episode. But we also have a couple of other gubbins attached to it. People might remember that last year, I think it was last year, not the year before, we did a 90s games magazine quiz where me and Matthew each had to guess what the game was based on an extract from various 90s video game magazines.
We decided to bring that format back a little bit. It takes a little bit of research, so don't do it that often. But we thought because it's a mailbag, we'll Trojan Horse it in with something more interesting.
So that's basically what we've done here, although whether that would prove to be true or not, I'm not sure. So Matthew, how do you find the process of researching these snippets for this quiz?
Yeah, it was good. I mean, I would like nothing more than to spend hours and hours and hours reading scans of magazines that I really enjoyed 20 years ago. But I also, as soon as I hit my quota of five, I was like fucking done.
Should we talk about that Guardian best games magazines thing? It's been interesting to see some of the conversation off the back of that. It's written by Keith Stewart.
It very much reflects what I would say is his era of magazines and his interests, which list features do that. It's generated some discussion about Edge, including people who have always had a problem with Edge fucking complaining about it, which they love to do. In general, I think you've got people talking about their favorite games magazines, Matthew.
I don't know if you have a top five in your head that you just sort of like, if I asked you to pull it out of your ass out of nowhere, could you come up with that?
Yeah, but they're probably going to be like very modern, because we're a little bit younger than Keith. So probably, I mean, in no particular order. Can it include magazines we worked on?
Yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah.
Well, NGamer, obviously. Well, the problem is, so I would pick NGamer, NGC and N64 as three separate magazines. People might say that they're part of the same lineage, but they are three very distinct entities.
Then I'd say Games Master, then I'd say Edge. That was it.
That was brisk. I like that. Yeah, you're not going to go for OXM brackets, the Castle years?
The Castle years of OXM were... I don't know if we've really talked about them in huge detail in the Game of the Year episodes.
No, we haven't really got to them yet.
Like, I didn't really achieve much with that magazine.
It wasn't easy, though. I remember what it was like.
Yeah, that was the beginning of, like, the making magazines is going to get quite hard and budgets are going to get quite small, and there's not a lot of time for, like, you know, larking about. And also, Xbox brand was, like, fucking bizarro. You know, it was Xbox One.
It's just come out. No one really knew what it was about anymore. I certainly didn't.
I had no affinity for it, but we can get into that in the Game of the Year episode. That was a proper, like, not phoning it in, but, like, editor. It felt like editor for hire work, you know?
I do remember coming over to your desk at one point during that era, and you were kind of like, yeah, this is my not-try-very-hard era. I think you said something like that. And you were like, you were quite...
I wouldn't say you were proud, but you were owning it. You were like, you know, there have been times where I've worked really hard, and this is not one of them. It's kind of like the vibe.
Is that fair? Do you think to describe how you were kind of... your outlook during that time?
Yeah, I think so. But that's okay, because I've worked under other people during their trying not very hard eras. So it was definitely like owed me.
Oh, yeah, for sure. Like, yeah, I've got a fucking long list of those. Yeah, it's funny that I look forward to circling back to that, but I suppose I should offer my five.
So Edge would be in there, PC Gamer would be in there. I think I would also chuck in Games Master. When I was going through magazines for this feature we're about to do, Games Master was such a joy to flick through.
There's so much good writing in there and it's so enthusiastic about games. And there's so much like random box out bullshit as well. Like the bit in previews that was like, well Sega GT is 75% complete, which I now know having worked on both sides of the fence, that's bollocks.
No one could ever tell you. No PR will ever say to you, oh, by the way, I need to fill out this box out that says how much percent the game is complete. And then they'll go, oh, yeah, no problem.
It's 75%. Like no one, that's never happened in the history of them. So I appreciate the kind of punts that goes into that sort of thing.
In general, though, just like a great read. I would say probably not to, this is definitely not like shade other people, but I would say that early noughties Games Master is the period I sort of enjoyed the most out of that. And then, I don't know, gosh, I would say Play Magazine, but working on it made me despise it.
I just really hated it after I worked on it. Not the modern version, but the version that existed previously. I would say the official PS2 magazine, really enjoyed that back in the day.
And I think probably N64 or NGC would take the other spot, because I would say N64 I've probably got slightly more affection for, just because as a portal into that world, it sold it as the most exciting thing going, and not something where there were basically two games every six months to talk about.
Yeah, who is that? And that's kind of tough. Yeah, I should say, official PlayStation 2.
I'd say the official PlayStation kind of line of magazines is kind of the official mags that sort of buck the trend. You know, I always thought official PlayStation just was better than official Xbox and official Nintendo in all its iterations.
Oh, yeah, there's some bad iterations of O&M as well, like the ones that were like stapled together and fell apart and the writing was like reading a leaflet is crap.
Yeah, but I thought the thing that was funny about that list or the thing that kind of bumped me out a bit is there's lots of people who stopped reading games magazines 20 years ago who were arguing about the magazines they read growing up when actually loads of really fine work was being done in that period. That's what kind of pissed me off about that list in the discourse. It's as if games magazines stopped in 2000 and they actually didn't.
And it made a hell of a sound on being precious because I worked in that period. But actually, some of our best games writers have emerged in that time. And print kept it lean, kept a lot of the bullshit of online out of it.
And while it is now even more diminished, sadly, just in terms of number of products, just to see people go, it's not even worth thinking about modern magazines. That is just bullshit. That infuriated me a bit.
It made me think a bit about this podcast and how I think we celebrate print quite well. I don't think we gatekeep print or tell anyone that their error is wrong and that our error is right. But I think there was quite a lot of that going on with this.
There's a lot of just people who, like you say, hadn't paid attention to it for 20 years, but were like saying, well, this is like this and I think you'll find that's like that. And it's just like I've never been interested in people who bollock on like that. I just think if you don't support the medium, why even talking about it?
But people do it.
I'd agree with that. If anything, when I've gone back to look at scans of some of these so-called legendary eras, there's a snotty-ness to like some late 80s, 90s stuff. You like this and you criticise this more sophisticated later era?
Give me a fucking break. But anyway, let's not get into it.
Well, there you go. Our top five magazines, everyone. Hooray!
OK, then the North East Magazine Quiz. So yes, very much celebrating an era that we like in GamesMag. So should I go with my one first, Matthew?
My first question for you?
Yes. So this is just a quote from the mag.
Yeah, it's a quote from the mag. Sometimes I might block out the name of a developer or the game. Just to make...
otherwise it's a fucking impossible exercise. OK, so an easy one to start with, I think. I'll say X to mean like, you know, the things I'm not saying basically.
So X doesn't include as much swearing as X Publishers PR might have you believe. Twatting shite, blurted by an upset cog, is the worst of the cursors.
This has got to be Conker's Bad Fur Day.
Correct! That was in Edge magazine.
Edge wrote twatting shite?
Well, they were quoting twatting shite from the cog, which would probably pass their style guide, you know. What's your first one for me, Matthew?
Some of mine are a bit long, I apologise, but...
So are mine. That's the shortest one I got, so...
Choose from one of four low-down, dirty beatniks, throw your highway code out the window, and prepare to scare the living daylights out of innocent civilians, all in the name of cash.
Well, it's got to be Crazy Taxi. What's the magazine?
That's NGC.
Oh, nice. Okay, very good. So an easy one to start off with.
I think this one's quite easy too, actually. So my second one for you. Still, if we're to judge it on dramatic aspirations, then it's a vaguely spooky time travel piece, reminiscent of a Sunday evening BBC serial.
The set design stems from small town Germany, and the script's a bit of Nolan's memento, a bit of Back to the Future, a lot of generic movie cliché, and a philosophy that could pass for cause and effect for dummies.
Well, this has to be Edge talking about shadows of memory.
It is, yeah. Did you read the same extract that I did?
No, I knew it was shadows of memory, but that has to be Edge.
Yeah, it is. What's your next one?
To keep things realistic though, you can't just walk around laying doggy eggs all over the shop. Let's face it, if you could, you would. So, almost as disturbingly, if your dog doesn't need to go, pressing the same buttons will cause him to do a huge fart instead.
Is this Dog's Life, the Frontier game?
Yes.
Do you know how many people have emailed in asking for sequels to that game? Just a lot of people, or at least a remaster. That's funny.
What's the mag? Is that OPM2? Games Master.
Doggie Eggs. That's the clear indicator there. That isn't part of Edge's style guide.
Is there a more cursed combination of words than doggie eggs?
I remember when I first joined Future, and I first wrote for Games Master, they gave me their style guide, and it said, don't just use common words like fart, try and be more poetic about it. Call them phantom bum eggs.
Excellent stuff. Look forward to the style guide's Excel episode coming soon to this podcast. Okay, so my third one for you, Matthew.
The Gulf War, as I'm certain you're aware, marked an important moment in the way wars were fought. It was fought almost entirely in the air, the majority of allied attacks coming in the form of air-to-ground assaults, not forgetting smart missiles so smart that if they forgot where they were going, they'd be able to stop and ask for directions in perfect Arabic.
Oh my god. Is this going to be like some kind of Ace Combat game?
Not air on ground. I think in the noughties, this kind of setting, I think it's quite obvious what this is personally, but...
Oh, okay.
PS2 era.
PS2 era, Gulf War, like a full-spectrum warrior or something?
You're along the right lines there. It's Conflict Desert Storm.
Oh, Conflict Desert Storm. Who wrote... was that OPM?
That's Games Master.
Oh, right.
Yeah. But yeah, hey, you know, it was... I guess I didn't have much in the actual game there, so it's a little bit more guess based on the setting.
What's your third one for me?
This game will probably appeal to the most grizzled of hardcore gamers, but it is also a game that everyone should have a chance to enjoy. Like some kind of demented, percussive version of Twister, it deserves to usher in a new paradigm for parlor games.
What the fuck is that? I mean, is that WarioWare?
Nope.
No, I've no idea.
Percussive is the key word here.
Percussive? Guitar Hero?
No, right, Error though. Samba Di Amigo.
Yeah, I wasn't going to get that.
Edge talking about Samba Di Amigo. Paradigm. That gives it away.
We said parlor games.
Well, I assume that's what you would now say. Parlor games make it sound like they're a Victorian gent.
Yeah, I only thought of percussive. I only thought of WarioWare because I thought of the deranged sounds that you hear in WarioWare. But I was wrong and that's fine, so it's all good.
Okay, my fourth one for you, Matthew. Five points linked by one line. To most nimble-fingered people, it would be nothing more than a swish of the stylus.
But for us, it was the moment that our initial adoration of X turned into steamed loathing. And the reason for this venting of theatre rage? Our total inability to draw a bloody star.
This has got to be Trauma Center.
Correct! In NGC Magazine.
Oh, nice.
Opening to the review, yeah.
Stylus, yeah, I remember that being like a big sticking point.
Yeah, I thought theatre rage might give it away a little bit as well.
Works on a lot of levels, that. This is quite a long one. Maybe this is too hard, we'll see.
Only the kind of people who select their smarties by colour or eat pizza with a knife and fork can really have any gripes about this game. As they reach for their monogrammed napkins, their nitpicky brains might complain that the gadgets and weapons perhaps lack the innovation of Ratchet's Arsenal or that the city isn't really the life-filled rogue-fest of GTA due to its drone-like cops and brainless population.
Is that Jack 2 Renegade? That is. I don't understand what any of that waffle at the start was.
I think they're saying only simple people would have any gripes about Jack 2. And by simple people, people who eat pizza with a knife and fork, which, listener, I do do. And who select their Smarties by colour, which I guess I sort of do.
I don't know.
No, they go in by the handful.
Smarties or tube first. In quite a tight, four-page GM review, that's quite a lot of words to spend on an elaborate dig at nitpicky people.
Yeah, I think the only real reason it gave it away was the open world and Ratchet being mentioned. That seemed like it was the intersection there. Otherwise, quite tricky.
I've given you such a hard one to end on.
I've got a hard one for you as well.
I feel quite bad about it. Okay, I will give you the hint of like this is a PS2 era game or so. In between missions, you'll meet some of the most charming comic creations this side of The Simpsons.
Take, for instance, The Clackers. Benign little bold chicken-like creatures with a razor sharp sense of humor. They're all loaded with tons of dialogue, some helpful, most not, but almost everything they have to say will make you chuckle.
Oh shit, I have no idea what this is.
It's like it's got British energy this series. It's quote unquote funny. It's got a key creator who is associated with the series, and he's extremely handsome.
Oh, I was about to say, like, is this fable or something? But that's not right.
There's Mollinue catching his tray there.
I mean, Mollinue looks fine. Someone who is really associated with this, and they are handsome. Funny dialogue, British humour.
It's not Psychonauts, again, no offence to Tim Schafer. Oh, is this an Abe game? Oddworld Stranger's Wrath.
Oh, the incredibly handsome... Lord Lanning.
What a dreamboat.
What a dreamboat, it makes very weird games.
It does, yeah. Should anyone who is that good looking be able to make this? It seems wrong somehow, doesn't it?
OK, in which case, we come to your last one for me, Matthew.
Theoretically, although it's not apparent for many hours, the game is actually somewhat limited. The developer has played it too straight with body types and personalities, while the toys run out sooner than you'd expect. The related website will help, offering hundreds of downloadable objects, plus the tools to create them, though that's not much comfort to PC users without access to the internet.
Is that black and white?
No, right, kind of like…
The Sims?
Yes, The Sims, yeah.
OK, yeah, is that Sims 2?
The Sims 1. What's the mag? I like the idea of like, it's a concern that you don't have the internet.
I thought that really dated it, but also you're like, well, that is right. That used to be a criticism of, oh, wow, you know, the good stuff shouldn't be online because who has online?
OK, well, that was the quiz. I think we'll call that a draw, Matthew. We've worked it pretty well there.
And I hope the listeners enjoyed that, yes, low-energy content, but hopefully a bit nostalgic and fun. So there's one other thing we're going to discuss before we get into this, Matthew. Do you want to steer this bit because this is your whole thing, isn't it?
Yeah, you've completely forgotten about this.
Oh, yeah, and it was only like four months ago. But yeah, it did happen. I looked into it.
It did happen.
Yeah, so in our predictions episode, we always predict what's going to happen in the coming year. And at the end of it, I thought it would be fun for us to play a kind of condensed version of fantasy critic, which for people who haven't heard of that, it's like fantasy football at the start of the year. You pick a load of titles.
There's a website that lets you do this. And then at the end of the year, you score on how those games scored in Metacritic reviews. So you're trying to pick a slate of games that's going to perform as well as possible.
You take it in turns. So there's obviously kind of a competition for who can pick the richest title. We did a reduced version.
We each picked five games. And to see by the end of the year, who had scored the highest cumulative Metacritic score on those games, I just thought as we were doing a mailbag and as it was nearly halfway through the year and as some of these games had come out, it would just be fun to check in and see how we were scoring.
Yeah, it's interesting because we're doing this. Well, looking at the list, I forgot I picked these games. So that was one thing.
And I did wonder if you'd bring it up knowing that you were triumphing. Well, we're probably both doing kinda similar.
Yeah, I wouldn't say there's any triumphing it currently.
No, I wouldn't say so. So you're going to read out what your games were, Matthew.
Yeah, and shall I read the scores out as well, those that are scored?
Yeah, if you've done that, then go for it.
Yeah, I've got your scores as well.
Great, go for it.
So I picked Hollow Knight Silksong, currently unscored, Elden Ring Shadow of the Earth Tree, currently unscored, Paper Marrow, The Thousand Year Door. I don't think reviews are out for that yet. Soon, though.
Persona 3 Reload, which has currently got a Metacritic of 87, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which currently has a Metacritic of 92. So my score is 87 plus 92.
Okay, excellent. But I'm sure that will change very quickly.
I mean, you'd think those three remaining games are big scorers.
Yeah, I think Paper Mario might get eights because it's an old game, and people would be like, oh yeah, this is good, but it's an old game. You know how people are like that sometimes with re-releases?
Part of me hopes it gets the 85 it has probably always deserved. But for this game, I hope it gets the 95%. It definitely doesn't deserve.
Heldon Ring might tip it for you here though, because people are just like, you know, even if that's like just you fight one big turd in a field, people will be like, fucking triumph of Miyazaki, because that's what they like with these games. So yeah, I look forward to the big turd boss in Shadow of the Erd Tree. Shadow of the Turd Tree.
Sorry. Do you want to read out my ones?
Yes. Samuel picked Metaphor Refantasio, currently unscored, but destined to be a big one, I think. Dragon Stogma 2, scoring 86 on Metacritic.
Lyca Dragon Infinite Wealth, scoring 89 on Metacritic. Senua Saga Hellblade 2, currently unscored, I think. And Unicorn Overlord, 87 on Metacritic.
It's not bad. I don't have a 90 plus like you do, which is annoying.
Metaphor Refantasio could definitely do that.
Now we get to the actual mailbag bit of the podcast. So thank you so much for collecting the Metacritic listings there, and for reminding me we did this. That's good co-hosting on your part, I would say.
So this first one then is from Graham S who runs the Backpage fansite that stores so much information that I forget. And that is a backpagepod.co.uk where you can find a record of every list we've ever made in there. It's a truly amazing artifact of whatever bullshit it is that we do on this podcast.
So thank you to Graham for that. So is it enough for the Switch 2 to be the same again but faster? Or will they have thought up something new to persuade everyone to upgrade?
Any guesses as to what that could be? So Matthew, I've got some thoughts on this, but I think this has come up maybe before, but it feels like we're closing in now on a reveal for this Switch 2. And I don't think anything's really leaked about what it does apart from maybe some magnetic Joy-Con upgrade thing.
And like some alleged specs, but nothing else. High concepts really come up. So what do you think?
Yeah, I mean, to be really, really boring about this, I just can't imagine this being like a radical departure from what the Switch is. Like as a core idea, it's sort of beloved and almost so sort of ubiquitous now that, you know, I wonder if it has entered that sort of fabled space of, you know, like a phone, you'll be happy to buy a new one, even though it kind of looks like the old one and performs a bit better. Maybe it has a few quirkier things, like the controllers connect slightly differently, like this leaked magnetic thing.
Says. I just can't imagine what more they can do with it, and maybe that just shows a huge lack of imagination on my part, or at least I can't imagine what they do with it without massively fucking it up. And that's kind of what gives me the fear.
Like really, this is how boring I am. I just want to know if my Switch games play on it. Like that is kind of the crucial part of it for me.
If they're going to resell me all my Switch games, that will be bad and will test the patience of even this massive Nintendo fanboy.
I don't think they'll do that. I think it's just too much has been built on that online platform. And we're not in the age where you can get away with that now, I don't think.
Please don't resell Breath of the Wild with a new graphic, 60 frames Breath of the Wild for 50 quid to me. Just give it to me for free. You've made all the money you need to make off that game.
Just give it to me for free. That's what I want.
Or for a 10 quid upgrade or something.
10 quid max. Or as part of my Nintendo Online subscription.
Oh yeah, the one I'm on. It's interesting because I think in some ways the 3DS was the model for this. It was iterative but in a way that wasn't mind-blowing like the jump to GBA would have been from the original Game Boy, for example.
So I think it, like you say, maybe has entered that rarefied space where it can be just an iteration of the previous thing. And I think it will end up being like that. I mean, it is Nintendo and something makes me think they might chuck in a secondary feature that's a little bit different.
Like something it can do. I don't know what that is. Like some motion control, tilt related something or other just because they do always like to dabble with something like that.
It's like, oh, and here's something it can do that your previous one could never do. Or some new social platform that exists within the system itself or something like that. Like just some innovate, a secondary innovation but not a primary hardware one because I agree they kind of have to keep selling it like this.
The Switch has been so successful. It has created a wave of competitor handhelds from the likes of Valve and Asus and all these different companies who have entered this space. And they all have the same form factor as the Switch because they nailed it.
They did it out of the gate. And there's not a reason to deviate really. The key thing for them is getting the messaging right so people understand they have to upgrade it.
This is what obviously killed the Wii U. People didn't know what the Wii U was in relation to the Wii. And as long as they've thought about how to get people to make that upgrade, I think it'll be okay.
Yeah. It's sort of like, will it be as successful as the original Switch? Maybe not.
That's going to be quite a big challenge because the bar is incredibly high. However, I don't think they're going to stop selling the Switch for a long time yet. That is a very, very successful handheld.
Even relatively speaking to previous Nintendo handhelds, I think this will have a longer tail on it, you know? Yeah. So that's kind of where I'm at with it.
Do you want to read out this next one, Matthew?
Yes. Hello. The question.
What's the most amount of time you've put into a game only to never finish it? Bonus points if it's not an RPG. For me, coming off your Xenoblades pod a few years back, I picked up Xenoblade Chronicles for the Switch and was both thoroughly enjoying it and also thankful when a series of boss fights and plot reveals signaled the end of the game after 85 hours.
Or so I thought. As it turned out, I was only on the penultimate chapter and I didn't have the stamina for another five hours. So I shamefully condensed that into a 10 minute YouTube Let's Play on fast forward.
If that was the question, this is the obligatory doesn't need to be read out on the air praise. Obviously, I love the pod. I actually discovered the pod after you'd launched the Patreon, but I was still listening to older RPS and PC Gamer UK podcasts so I signed up on Patreon before having listened to The Back Page:, which is perhaps the closest I've come to pre-ordering.
My faith was rewarded in tons of game, film and book recommendations and even a pre-owned 3DS purchase, which is a generation I completely missed out on at the time. If either of you are ever lost on your way to an industry event in LA and find yourself melting in the Arizona desert, I will do my best to find a top-notch sandwich shop. At the time of writing, I'm still a year behind on podcasts, so apologies if the sandwich meta is antiquated.
Cheers from Tom.
Yeah, I guess we don't talk about sandwiches much anymore, do we? I've settled into my tailor's bagel phase, I would say. I go there twice a week.
They're very, very good. Their lox is excellent. Smoked salmon, cream cheese and some capers or something in there.
That's so far away from where you live, man.
Yeah, I know. I think it's a mile and a half.
That's mad.
I think it's that far. By the time I've walked it, I really need a fucking sandwich because all the calories have burned. So it kind of works out.
But that's what I'll do for a good sandwich, Matthew. That's the difference between you and I. I don't just go to the nearest location.
Oh, I do. Also, the milk Bundeli is pretty good as well. It's like a burger chain that's dipped into sandwiches.
They're quite high concept. They've got quite spicy sandwiches. I don't know, it's maybe like a Vietnamese tinge to some of them.
Quite an interesting selection.
Yeah, they're quite opulent.
Yeah, yeah, for sure. What were you going to say, Matthew?
I don't want to name it. They're not listening to it, but I've started going back to a sandwich shop, which I used to frequent, and it had a change of ownership. I went back and I actually went there pretty steadily for like a fortnight.
Right.
But every time I went in there, I witnessed the most chaotic sandwich behaviour imaginable. And I don't know why I kept going back. It must be sort of adjacent to the kind of wanting to look at car crashes when you drive by, except I kind of tear myself away from like what mad shit is going to happen in here.
There's like a sidekick. There's the main sandwich person and there's like a sidekick. And the sidekick kick seems to me to be terrified of everything in the sandwich shop and any request that is made of them.
And I've like, I've never had to stifle so many laughs waiting to get my lunch as someone comes in and asks for like anything outside of the most common sandwich, like a tuna malpinini. And I have to stare, oh, he's bulging in fear of like, oh shit, I'm going to die because I have to make this thing. And it's so cursed.
I've said this in the office and no one really knew what I was getting at, but it's like, it feels like you're in a Safdies Brothers film.
Yeah, yeah.
Like it's just, it buzzes with this like, oh, this is really bad. And it's on the cusp of us all dying.
Yes. Do you know what I saw the other day? I saw JC's kitchen in town.
Have you spotted him? He was in Friday.
Is he still selling his bullshit sausages?
No, he's gone back to Bubbl & Squeak and it's the original guy. It's the original JC. So, I mean, not Jesus Christ, but the Vogue who runs it.
He was in his little booth. And again, I was just, I'm just furious because obviously going back today, he's not there. When will he be back?
I have no idea. But he was just in town centre outside Smash Burger. He had a little stall set up.
And I was just, again, the frustration with him is the lack of reliability on location. He still just appears out of nowhere like fucking Zur in Destiny. Honestly, man, it's just, it's tested me.
But yeah. So the answer to this question of games that we've played for a long time and not finished. Two answers for this that are probably like the highest number of hours put into them on my part.
Final Fantasy XII and Bloodborne. XII I think I played for 50 hours, didn't finish it, which is bad. But it was my save was trapped on PS2 and then I moved.
I think I've told the story of the podcast before. Moved my PS2 saves over to my PS3 and then my PS3 got the yellow light of death and died with my save on it. So never saw the end of that game.
And Bloodborne is the other one I played. I must have played over 50 hours of this and made such pathetic progress. I've only killed Vick or Amelia.
Got no further than that. And the last thing I remember happening was waking up in a jail cell and then just getting crushed by a boulder and thinking, oh, fuck this, uninstalling it. And that's basically like the Bloodborne experience.
What about you, Matthew?
I don't know if I finished Fallout 4. Started playing it again recently and I just have no memory of the ending. But I played the shit out of that game when it first came out.
So I'm increasingly convinced I haven't finished it and somewhere there is a Fallout 4 save where I've spent 60 or 70 hours trekking all over Boston. Likewise, these are all RPGs. I played loads of Lost Odyssey, never finished it.
Too long ago now, don't really remember anything about it. I have finished it now, but it took me ages to finish Like a Dragon to the point that when I started playing it I had no idea what was going on and the Yakuza stories can be pretty confusing because there's so many characters. So, Like a Dragon, I actually played it almost all the way to the end and then played it all the way through again just because I just had no idea what was going on.
And the one that kills me, even though it wasn't a particularly famous story or anything that you needed to finish, but Dragon Quest IX on DS, I played loads of that and I think I just lost the cart. So, yeah, God knows what happens at the end of that. But it had all these little, like, downloadable dungeons and things.
You could just play, play it and play it and play it without ever really finishing it. So, yeah, those, yeah, they're the only games that are, like, long enough to have that kind of effect. It's quite hard to think of non-RPG games that do that.
I guess Sekiro, in that I just gave up at that stupid prick at the top of that tower.
Yeah, the test to see if you can finish the game.
Yeah, and I can't, but I played loads of it and I have one of the most successful tips videos on it on YouTube, which is absolutely hilarious. Suckers. Everyone's like, this guy really knows what he's talking about, and you're like, nope.
That's a triumph, frankly. I'm very impressed by that. Yeah, so Lost Odyssey, I played a bunch of that as well and just couldn't quite get to the end.
It's tough when a generation moves on or something new comes out and then it just falls to the bottom of your list and it has no chance of getting back on top of the pile. I'm a bit wary of this happening with Marvel's Midnight Suns actually, which I did. I think I got past the end of the first act, which is a very long act.
It was more than 28 hours I played. And then, yeah, got a bit into the second act, but if I don't pick it up in the next couple of months, there's a chance I'll just forget about it forever. So I must do that.
I must put in the remaining 42 hours to see the end of that game.
When I read this email from Tom and he was like, come to Arizona, we'll go to sandwich shops. In my head I was like, I actually want to do that. That sounds great.
Just to go and impose myself on a stranger through this podcast, because that's what Conan O'Brien does in his new documentary. He just goes and bothers fans around the world. And listen, I'm not saying we're anywhere near the level of Conan O'Brien, obviously.
But that would be fun, wouldn't it?
Yeah, it would. It would. Anyway, should we move on to the next question?
And we'll go to Arizona another time. So, hey Japs, after completing Infinite Wealth, what would be your job slash class in a Yakuza game? And what would your ultimate move be?
Keep up the quality pod work, hustle, just kai. So, I did a bit of research on this, Matthew, because I have not played enough of the recent Dragon Games to understand the classes. So I'd go for the gangster class and I'd have chef abilities.
I'm told that's a thing that you can do. I'd heal the entire party by distributing chicken wings, which give you some kind of combat boost. And they're very spicy.
You're going to give out your teriyaki pops.
No, those are only allegedly chicken. They don't have...
I was going to say, those are for just Sammy. I do not share the teriyaki pops.
When you get the teriyaki pops out of the microwave, it just looks like post-apocalyptic mush. It's just like this congealed sort of like... When you eat it, it's quite nice, but it's...
Just don't look at it. Don't look down. Keep your eyes forward and the plate under your chin at all times.
It's like swamp thing in the form of food. It's not good. What about you, Matthew?
Have you gone for similar food-related gags?
No, well, I thought he was asking us to take a different job... Like, not to make a class based on a job we had. I obviously misunderstood this.
Because all the job classes in Like A Dragon are based on jobs, professions that you have. So I thought I'd be a home-based employee, as I was back in the day, and my ultimate move would be I smash a can of Dulux paint into your face, and then I grab their body, put their bruised head under the paint scanner machine, and then it would cut to a shot, and it says two months later, and I'm in a living room, and it's painted the exact shade of that bruise. And then my mum comes in and goes, what colour is this?
And I say, it's a bruised man's face.
Excellent. I mean, lots of thought went into that. So this is what happens when you send Matthew the questions far in advance.
Yeah, and they don't go into my junk mail.
No. I was going to say, is it a missed opportunity to not close their head in your mini fridge? You know, just sort of like...
Closing it over and over again, and like Rio and sort of like Kit Kats are falling out, you know?
Well, that's it. The thing is, I'm trying to heal myself, but unfortunately all the portions I have are so tiny, because they're miniature cartons of apple juice and two finger packets of Kit Kat. So my HP only ever goes up at like 10 at a time.
People are like, don't play us that class. His healing is so low per turn, because he only drinks miniature foods. It's incredibly frustrating, though the Dulux paint mixing finisher is incredible.
Maybe not after like the fifth time you've seen it.
Yeah, after that you're like, please can I skip this animation? He's talking to his mum again. Okay, good.
Do you want to read out this one, Matthew?
Hello, gents. Putting that Patreon money to good use on bath meat and steel battalion controllers, I hope. Anyway, with Hades 2 rearing its horny head in online discourse, how are you planning on dealing with the onslaught of performative social media horniness?
Will it be elaborate filters to nip it all in the bud, or summary blockings on a case-by-case basis? In all seriousness, thanks for all your efforts with the pod. It has become something truly special and precious to me, especially the Magstuff and the Best of Year series.
Takes me right back. Best wishes, Jörgen E. Steen Hansen.
Hades 2 horniness. For about a week, people were arguing about why Hades 2 is good horny versus the bad horny in Stellar Blade. They stopped after about three days.
And now they don't really talk about it. I've become slightly more interested by the way people perceive, try and perceive or understand what a gender-specific gaze is, what male gaze is versus not male gaze. I thought about this because I saw one piece say that Love Lies Bleeding, the Rose Glass film, subverts the male gaze and is not really sexy at all.
And I thought that was actually bollocks and the scenes in that are quite gratuitous and some other critics believe that as well. But it made me wonder if people are actually equipped to talk about what the meaningful differences are between these things. And I'm not convinced that they are, to be honest.
And so, I don't know. I can see why people like the designs in Hades too. And I think they are coherent and of a piece with each other.
And I can see why they are tasteful horny versus what has been deemed the bad horny in Stellar Blade. I understand that. But yeah, the performative hornyness.
I don't, again, like I might just have to go into my muted words on Twitter and add like mommy to it. There's a bit of that going on. What about you, Matthew?
Yeah, I've already cut out most of the horny discourse with my muted words list. That muted words list is the death of my career if it ever gets out. It's just so, it's so cynical.
And it's just an eye roll at so much stuff. But so it goes. Yeah, it feels like the Hades 2 discourse hasn't properly kicked off.
People who are engaging with it seem to be engaging with it as an early access game and in the spirit that it's intended. I've seen some people discussing the mechanics of it, which is, I guess, what this period is really about. I'd be surprised if they're focus testing the horniness in this period and they're going to get more or less horny based on it.
Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Someone from Supergiant...
No, it's not Supergiant. It is Supergiant, yeah. Someone from Supergiant can reach out and tell us if they're tracking any kind of horniness, kind of quotas or something.
Yeah, they've got a horny slider on the road map so you can make it more or less horny, and then Aphrodite is wearing a jumper when you and I play it, basically.
Yeah, and has the face of our mothers.
Okay, there's no need to say anything else. Let's move on to the next question. Hi gents, if you had to live in a time period for a year pre-1900s, what era would you choose?
And a follow up question, if you could only witness but not alter the outcome of one moment in history, what would you go back and be there for? Brackets, I put that condition in of just witnessing, otherwise everyone just says they'd go back and kill Hitler before his rise to power.
Oh, we can't have that, can we Kurt?
I'm so angry, Kurt. Angry Kurt asked a lot of like, I would say irrelevant questions in the questions channel of the Discord for this episode, and I just picked this one because I think it was the most fun. Matthew, what have you got for this one?
Well, I mean like, broad era, I was thinking like, you know, you go back to Shogun time and become the Anjin.
Fuck's sake, you get time travel and it's more weeb content. Fuck it now, Matthew.
Well, yeah, but what I'd actually, well, the period I'd like to go to and the thing I'd like to witness are kind of one and the same. I'd actually go to the Chicago World Fair in 1893, which is the subject of that book, The Devil and the White City, because it's the guy who made the Chicago World Fair and then the maniac HH. Holmes who made that murder hotel.
And I obviously want to go to the Chicago World Fair because you can only read about it and see pictures and it just sounds incredible what they achieved there and the scale of it and the sense of wonder and the way it kind of took over the city. I guess the thing that I'd witness, but without changing, is go to the murder hotel and just check out and see if the vibes were as off as everyone says they were. Maybe drop a little Google review.
Not enough murder, two stars.
Well, that's the thing, because I can't alter history, so I can't be there like, oh, I saw someone go down a chute from their bed into a dungeon, or whatever it was he did. But I could be like, just the vibes are off, and the management seems... I wouldn't be surprised if there was something up with that guy.
Did the Dark Pictures games do that premise as one of their episodes?
Yeah, I think they riffed on it for the last one.
Jesse Buckley one?
Yeah, I don't know if it was... It was the one with Jesse Buckley in it.
Yeah.
But I don't know how much... If it is specifically this homeless guy, or if it's set in that period, if it's just inspired by...
There was a while where Scorsese was directing a movie about this, wasn't there? With Leo in it, but then that disappeared.
Yeah, hard to see it as a film, maybe as a TV show. Also, the two things are happening in tandem, but they're not really connected. The guy, he works really hard to remind you, to try and make you think they're connected, in terms of what happened.
Both are the works of visionary men who just took their genius in slightly different directions. You're the architect of something amazing, and you're the architect of something horrible, but it's not like they were best mates or anything.
It's a good choice, though. I'd like to see that at World's Fair, too. I went with the day Anne Boleyn was executed.
You want to see her get her head chopped off?
No, I don't want to. I was more curious about what's the vibe check on it. How do people feel about this?
Is this good that the Queen is being killed? What are people saying about Henry VIII?
You see what they're doing, Vox Pops.
I'll just go around talking to Thomas Wyatt and various members of his court or wherever. I'll just sound them out and see what the deal is and how people feel. And then when the execution takes place, I'll just go for a walk in the forest or something.
You don't want to be around there.
Yeah, exactly. That's the pre... Well, pre-1900s, I was just thinking, I only want to be there for a day or something.
I don't want to spend an extended period. You will not want to spend more than a day in Shogun times, surely, just because...
It depends if I'm respected and beloved like the Anjin.
Are you worried, though, that size-wise you'd be significantly larger? Because it's many, many years ago, and you're just this giant white guy. Do you worry about they might see you as some kind of folklore monster?
Like, kill you or something?
Or some kind of yokai.
Yeah, basically. It was way on my mind.
I hope not.
Just stand far away.
Also, I can't claim to understand any military tactics. I can't offer Toronaga... This is fictional, but I can't offer anyone that help.
It's quite hard to worm my way into any court, because I just don't have the skill set for it. Like, a massive Jester.
Yeah, the largest Jester imaginable. Dark Souls boss sized Jester.
We've got a fucking massive Jester. He's like twice the size of us. It's crazy.
Speaking of that, the one I had about... I don't know, that moment you could witness is like a follow up question, because one had to be pre-1900s and one didn't. So, I'd just be there the day that Marlon Brando turned up overweight on the set of Apocalypse Now, just to see, like, Coppola lose his mind, and Marlon to be like, it's fine, let's put a black shirt and stand in the dark or whatever.
I'd like to see that, because he turned up, I think he was like two or three stone heavier than they thought he was going to be. Basically, he's just the size I am now, but obviously you can't put that on film, so it's tough. There you go, Kurt.
I hope that was satisfying for you. This next one, Matthew, do you want to read this out?
Good afternoon, gents. Build us a game based on Thunderbirds.
Yeah, so I did have a go at this. I remember incidentally playing a Thunderbirds side-scrolling game on GPA that wasn't that good, but it was okay, if I recall. It was just a side-scrolling shooter thing.
Art was all right. I'm quite fond of the Gerry Anderson whole thing. Did that happen for you, Matthew?
I was big, big into it, yeah.
Yeah, because there was a period in the 90s when they brought them all back, wasn't there? It felt like they had a big push. They sold all the toys again.
I certainly had toys for Captain Scarlet, Stingray. Stingray had that rad building that goes underwater to go out of sight when they're firing missiles at it or wherever they'd pop it underground. That was rad.
Yeah, so I did give this some thought. I kind of think these should be five smaller games within the game, really, to reflect the Thunderbirds' various abilities. They're all different ships or vehicles, essentially.
So Thunderbird 1, which is kind of like a rocket thing, but doesn't go into space. It just flies around a lot. That's a side-scrolling shooter.
Makes sense. Thunderbird 2 is a game of choosing which little vehicle to deploy to rescue people and then pulling it off in third person, basically. So if you pick the digger, you go dig, you go save someone.
Done. Very good. 3 is exactly the same as 1, except you're in space.
Just side-scrolling shooter again. 4 is Naval Warfare. Just a tiny submarine trying to blow people up from underwater.
That thing's tiny. That can't fight anything substantial underwater.
But imagine it was like, right, the Hood or whatever he's called. Is that his name? I think it was his name.
He's got an aircraft carrier and you've got to fucking sink this. You've just got to hit it with 400 missiles and it goes down.
Yeah, that's the route. I don't get too into it, but they're not warring men. They're Thunderbirds.
They're rescuers. There was an episode where they were like, you've got to go fuck up with an aircraft carrier.
No, that is true. You got me on that one. And 5, which is just a space station, that's basically the strategic layer in XCOM.
You're just responding to shit, you're sending the other brothers to do different stuff for you. And then sometimes it's like, oh, Australia needs help. You're like, well, I can't fucking help you.
I've already sent Thunderbird 1 to, like, you know, sort of like Morocco or whatever. So yeah, that's my take, Matthew. What about you?
Anything to add?
Yeah, I kind of, I didn't think about it in such great detail, but I thought something like, obviously like a co-op game where five people are, like, role playing as all the different people. No one ever wants to be Thunderbird 5, because that's just going...
Or Brains.
Yeah, that's just telling everyone to, or if you want to make it, like, more than five players, you can definitely, you can have Brains, you can have the dad, Tracy, whatever his name is, you can have Keeranu, the butler, Tintin. Is it Tintin?
Is she, like, the hotty French lady?
No, that's Lady Penelope. I think it's Tintin, who's, like, Keeranu's daughter. Keeranu, of course, isn't he, like, the brother of the Hood?
And because, as we all know, as happens with brothers, you can mind control your brother by chanting his name.
It causes all kinds of problems to have him on site, I would say.
He is a huge liability. Like, does Jeff Tracy, that's the dad, does Jeff Tracy know that Keeranu is compromised like this? And he's like, he's just really loyal to the family.
And they're like, yeah, but dad, he's literally like a, he can be controlled by our worst enemy.
And it's like, Brains, were you not keeping an eye on this? Do you know what I mean? That kind of, yeah.
Yeah, it's a tough, it's a tough deal. The other thing I wondered about was like, to get a bit meta and like lean into them being puppets, where you're controlling them, controlling the vehicle to go and do rescues, but you have to control them like you would a puppet. So it ends up being a bit like Surgeon Simulator.
It's like a bit wonky like Hans. So they're all a bit like Octodad, you know? So it's like Scott Tracy in Thunderbird 1 going to Morocco, or wherever, except he's like crazy like puppet limbs all over the shop.
I could see that being a big Twitch sensation.
I could see that. Virgil has accidentally dropped sort of Thunderbird 4 on top of the House of Parliament, and I see it. And it's sort of like creating a civil incident.
It's because of his puppet hands, couldn't do it properly. That sort of thing. Yeah, very good, Matthew.
I like that. I think we've given that the time and energy it deserves. Yeah, okay.
Next question then. You've alluded to the quarterly Back Page: planning meeting sometimes being held at the pub. What are your favourite pub snacks, past and present?
That's from Ryan Plugs. We got Matthew.
I'm not a big pub snacks guy. I like cashew nuts, but not many places have them. I'll always eat crisps, but I'm not like a crisps fiend.
I'm the motherfucking never buys crisps, but always eats crisps if they're on the table.
Yeah, you'll always get someone who buys two packs of crisps and they rip the bag right open so everyone can reach both bags. And then it comes to your round and you return with nothing except the points. And people are like, oh, this is bullshit.
Or you get a bag for you and the communal trough bag, which everyone else can have the communal trough bag. But the understanding is your bag is just for you.
I've got a few answers to the past and present vibe here. I was talking the other day about pork scratchings and how I feel like they've fallen a few tiers in the snack vibes. They've got big 70s energy to them, just malnutritious, salty, fatty food that no one eats anymore.
But a good pork scratching will really sort you out, I think. That's a good mental health boost. Scampi fries, I enjoyed those still.
I think those have still survived. And then I think it's cheese-flavoured moments that had to die a death about 10 years ago. Those are some of my favourites.
Twiglets, I'm always fond, but you never get enough of a bit of bag. So tough out there, man. Anything more to add, Matthew?
No, I'm sorry that you would think I would like more snacks than I do.
We more commonly go to have a pizza when we have a plan meeting, don't we?
Yeah, that's the thing, we eat a pizza with it. I'm more sweet tooth than I don't eat a lot of salty crisps and snacks and things.
As established in the Dreamcast episode, Matthew's like, I've got a friend around, I'm getting muffins and cookies. That's Matthew's energy. Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
If you had to, which game would you do a demake of when you roll back a game and make it in the style of a previous console? That's from Bob Bob.
Gosh. I mean, the really obvious answer would be to do one of the Final Fantasy games in the FF6, 4, 5, SNES style. But that's just so conventional.
I was thinking, what if you re-rolled the two PS4 God of Wars into the PS3 or PS2 format? So they're a bit nastier, but a bit more gnarly and fun in that God of War 3 style. I wondered if that might be quite good.
I could imagine what the big World Serpent looks like in PS2 vision. I could sort of visualise that. That might be sort of fun.
Or I'd do something like Alan Wake 2, so it looks like Max Payne 2, and it's just got that sort of old remedy look to it. That might be kind of fun. But I don't really hanker for this kind of thing, to be honest.
I think games... It's very rare. I don't think I've ever thought, oh, this game would make more sense if it was in 2D or if it was two generations earlier.
You know what I mean? How about you, Michael?
Yeah, it's cute. I like seeing one screenshot that someone's rigged up and drawn. When this stuff first arrived on my radar, it was like, here's a screenshot of Halo.
It was a SNES game or whatever. I thought, oh, that was cool. I don't know.
Maybe the later Ace Attorneys, including the great Ace Attorney Chronicles, could pull them back into the old kind of GBA DS art style so that you've got one really coherent saga all with the same visual style. It wouldn't radically change them, but that would be cool. Even if it's just an un-unlockable visual filter or something, I'd be into that.
Yeah, I think that kind of works. That has resolved this question, Matthew, so we can move on to the next one. Okay, not including Matthew's IMDB-credited role in Metal Gear Solid Legacy, if you could appear in a documentary based on any game slash series, what would it be?
Some IMG TR-63.
Again, sorry, I sound like a broken record. Probably Ace Attorney in terms of a thing that I can talk about and have insights beyond just really liking it from having talked to Shuta Komi. Is that a kind of bar for quality in a documentary that you can actually contribute something?
I don't want to just hear minor celebs going, oh yeah, it was really good. I want to hear someone tell me something new in a documentary that I had not heard. I've probably got a couple of those anecdotes from having interviewed him.
He could tell them himself as well in the same documentary, but I'd be of most use to an Ace Attorney documentary, I think.
I was thinking for me it'd be Resident Evil, but specifically Resi 4 onwards, just because that's very much sort of from my zone. So I could sort of weigh in on what happens between like 4, 5, 6 and 7, which is kind of like the most fascinating series of creative fluctuations in a given series. I think I could talk about that quite authoritatively.
The mercenary section, if you're not heading that up, something's gone very wrong. You need to be on there going, need egg! That's what the chapter's called on the DVD chapter select menu.
Yep, give me an egg. That would be perfect. Metal Gear was a cool one, though.
It was cool that Matthew was involved, even though it was preposterous. I was happy for you, man. Do you want to read this next one?
In Ken Grimwood's 1986 sci-fi novel Replay, a man who loops back in time 25 years every time he dies identifies someone else who is similarly affected by realizing that they've used their knowledge of the future to plagiarise screenplays of films that do not yet exist. If you've found yourself in a similar situation, what video games or books, TV shows, films, or even ideas for companies or inventions would you rip off from memory to become famous, rich and acclaimed? That's from Koig.
This is a tough one. I think I'd go back to 2014 and buy shares in future. Oh dear.
A few people we know got very rich off of that, or the execs or whatever. We say we know that we'd heard off, not that we'd known. None of the friends had the shares.
I don't know. It would have to be something simple, but really nicely done. Something like Memento is a great idea for a film because it's got a great twist, it's got a great novel spin on it.
I guess it wasn't a massive success though, so I don't know.
It kind of launches Nolan. It depends how much you want to work though, because then you've got to remember all the subsequent Nolan films to continue that career, and some of those plots are fucking gnarly. Like being like, oh, I've stolen the plot of Tenet.
Good luck.
Yeah. Samuel's turned in Act 2 of Tenet, and there's like a dot, dot, dot, I don't remember at the end of it.
Just all I know is, you've got to get me Kenneth Branagh.
John David Washington drives the car backwards, and then they're like, you're fired, kind of thing. Yeah, OK. So that kind of comes to mind, I think.
Something like Memento, or Fight Club as well. Big twist things are kind of like, even if you don't get the execution quite right, if you land the twist, and I think they could still have the same impact. But this did make me want to read Ken Grimwood's replay, which I then said, I think this is sacrilegious.
Isn't the film yesterday with the Beatles songs basically just this? What about you Matthew?
Yeah, it's tricky because I don't believe in myself enough that even if I had the head start, in that I'd stolen an idea that I knew had been a success in another timeline, I don't know what I'd do with it. I don't know how to get... If I go back 25 years, I'm living at home outside of Winchester, but I've got the plot to the Matrix, you know?
Actually, the Matrix is too early, it's a wrong example, but I've got Inception or whatever. I can't get that off the ground. I'll just live out of Soap Winchester.
I'm just a maniac. You've got to trust me. This film is going to explode.
It's really good where I come from in the future, and then I'm in freaking asylum, you know? So I honestly think this gift would be wasted on me, and I'd be better off just ripping off the stock market. That is what I'd do.
I wouldn't try and take someone's creative work. I'd just become incredibly rich. Maybe finance that work.
I'd finance Nolan. So my name is fundamentally on this product.
You said this before, I think, where you're like, I don't want to make it. I just want to have my name on it. I can't remember what that was for, but this is one of your fantasies.
I don't want to have to do the work, but I do want to have funded it in a fantasy scenario and to be involved.
Like if I was like, oh, I'm going to try and rip off one of Stu Turton's books and rewrite Evelyn Hardcastle.
It's a complex book to remember.
Yeah, and you have to still write a whole book, and that's why I haven't got in me.
Okay. All right, that's a good answer to that question, maybe. So do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
I'm currently looking at a Steam library that is 443 strong at the time of writing, not to count the innumerable games I have available on Game Pass, PS Plus and the mountain of indies I've downloaded on my Switch over the last six years. When you're not playing more recent releases for the podcast, how do you decide what you're going to play in your spare time? That's from Ryan Plugs.
I've got to admit, the podcast has completely poisoned how I play games, in a good way. In some ways, it has forced me to try and keep up with contemporary games within reasonable spending, so I'm not bank up to myself to play everything, which I don't do. Then I do try and make sure I've played 20 to 25 key games from the year, so I can have a good top 10 at the end of the year, because we both take some pride, I think, in making sure those lists are good.
That is something that has shaped it in some ways. Then apart from that, I have basically a tier list of blockbuster-y kind of games that I've missed or not finished in recent years, that I do try and tick off or I have at least an intent to finish in the background. The likes of Returnal or Horizon Games or Red Dead Redemption 2 or Elden Ring, God of War Ragnarok, which I didn't finish.
Then there's also another list that's more lost classic stuff I never played properly. That's why I played Deus Ex a few years ago for the first time. That's got some of the older Zeldas on there, like N64 Zeldas, Planescape Torment, Thief, etc.
But the podcast has definitely changed this. I wonder if we weren't making the podcast where they would play as much as many modern games. I don't think I would.
But I like the experience of having a podcast and talking about them. So it balances out. What about you, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, very similar driven by the podcast. Currently, my job requires me to play as many games and be on top of these things. So I honestly don't know what I do without a project or a job to kind of force me to play something next.
That isn't like I wouldn't say like I wouldn't play video games without those things. But in the last couple of weeks, actually, the perfect example, I haven't had a... There isn't something big that I need to play for work or for the pod.
I know I've got to play Beyond Good and Evil at some point. And my weekends have been very patchy as a result. Like I've played, you know, two hours of Dark Souls, two hours of Nier Automata again, Octopath Traveler 2, I've played a bit of that Lorelei and the Laser Eyes.
I haven't found the thing. Like I do worry that I'm permanently broken and I need that push to play something. Like something being exceptional isn't like enough to hold my attention anymore.
Like my brain is just broken from years of doing this as a job. And so yeah, that kind of sucks.
Yeah, that's unfortunate. I'm kind of broken in a different way where I just sort of like sit around titting about not playing games. But I don't have a compulsive.
Yeah, I wouldn't do what you did exactly. I'm quite good at sort of like very gradually noodling away at games. But then my attention span is not great.
So I can't stick with the same thing for more than like a couple of hours unless it's really good. Though Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a big focus point recently. But yeah, it's tricky.
Matthew even played Sifu and bounced off of it. It's been a bit of a weird few weeks for my guy.
Yeah, I really don't know what I'm doing with myself.
Yeah, tough. OK, well, on that sort of mournful note, we'll go to the next question. Matthew, did you write the Loreley preview in April's Issue of Edge?
And a more discussion-friendly question. Are either or both of you able to pick out the authors of each and every Edge piece by the writing style? To what extent do the hardcore cadre of UK games writers leave behind the traces you need to identify them?
And how much individual flair slash style is preserved once the editor gets their hands on the copy? That's some omni-slip. Did you write that preview, Matthew?
Oh, I didn't, no.
Well, there you go. It's probably Chris Yelling.
I only wrote a couple of things for Edge a year. Now, that isn't a complaint.
Yeah, there's not that many writers where I could identify straight away. Chris Donlan, I could definitely identify his work on Eurogamer. If you took his byline off, I could understand it every single time.
If it started with an anecdote about Blackpool Pier or something, I'd be like, that's Donlan right there. There's a few other writers where I could maybe suss it out, like Chris Livingston on PC Gamer. If I was reading a diary feature about a slightly janky sim game, I would know it was him.
I could identify his sense of humour, I think, but it's quite tough. What do you think, Matthew?
In the magazine days, probably had a better idea. I think I can identify Mark Green's writing and Tim Weaver's writing, say, from having read them growing up. Interestingly, sidelined this, I think I can identify Chris Inedge.
I really like Chris Schilling's reviews and I can always pick him out. The one thing I really always can do is because Chris freelances a lot for total film. In a 120 word review, I know if it's a Chris shit, he's really really good at little concise film reviews.
When I'm reading, I'm always like, I bet this is going to say Chris at the bottom. Even though it's short, you'd think it would be in my eye line. That's a little game I like to play with total film.
Is, did Chris write this little 120 DVD review? Hi gents, Nicholas Cage recently claimed his earliest memory was being in the womb. What was your earliest memory?
Mine was my fourth birthday in a local cafe with my friends, where I was dressed as Woody from Toy Story. That's another angry Kurt special.
Yeah, you're sure it wasn't your 40th birthday, Kurt? No, I'm only joking.
That's what I'd like to witness, Kurt's fourth birthday with him dressed as Woody.
My earliest memory is I remember the second or third day of school and seeing my little mate Donald reading a book in the library. That is probably the very earliest. The most notable early memory is I remember what I think was my fifth birthday, where I got given some car toy where you had to drive a little car in a kind of...
It's like a top-down sort of racing game, I guess, but it was physically a car inside this little unit thing, and it made some really loud noise. And some kid at my birthday party had taken that and was playing it, and I grabbed it off him and went, mine, and then my mum put me outside on the patio by myself while my party was going on inside without me. So I've grown up to be that same person.
What about you?
I have a very early memory of bawling my eyes out on a children's rollercoaster and a theme park on the Isle of Wight. To look at it, to call it a rollercoaster, it's not that. It's probably a miniature railway.
Are you sure it wasn't like the ferry to the Isle of Wight?
No, it was a little train that went just round in the tracks. I remember bawling my eyes out on that. I have a very clear sense memory of my Christmas stocking as well when I was a kid, like the noise it made and the texture and stuff.
OK, Matthew, I think we should just do a couple more here, because that will hit the spot for this episode. A question for YouTube Legends, inspired by the year-in-review episodes. If there was a single decade-long time frame in which you could only play games released in that window for the rest of your lives, assuming access to region-free hardware and software, what range of years would you choose and why?
That's from Jamie Smith. I think it's a great question, because you can basically capture about an era and a half with ten years. You can roughly capture two eras depending on the generations, but my first response to this was going to be you pick the late 90s, so you go from 98 through to, I guess, end of 07, so you get GoldenEye, but also Halo 3, The Orange Box.
It's pretty good, but the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if, I don't know, if you pick the last ten years, you'd get so many games that it's almost worth it just for the vast Steam library you'd have. I don't know. And then I think I ended up settling around, I'd do end of the PS2 era through to sort of like the mid 2010s.
So let's say like 2005 to 2014. So that gets you, gosh, I guess you like GTA V, but it also gets you like the original God of War and Metal Gear Solid 3 and Akami and Bully and that kind of like end of the PS2 era of stuff. Complicated.
It's a good one though. It's a good exercise. What about you, Matthew?
Yeah, my period starts on the 16th of November 2007, the day Mario Galaxy came out and obviously runs to the 16th of November 2017, which just gets me Mario Odyssey. So everything that falls between that, basically the meat of the Wii, the 316, the PS3 and okay, maybe like the first half of PS4, Xbox One, all the PC stuff gets me Breath of the Wild. It gets me Mario Odyssey and immensely, you know, 3DS, basically all of that.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Yeah, that's pretty good. It doesn't like it doesn't drag in like there are ways you say, like you say, dragging in more consoles and like a bigger range of things. But I think for my personal taste, basically the period this podcast covers.
Yeah, that's good. Yeah. It's pretty decent.
You get the Titanfall 2 single player campaign. The thing is, for me, is I need to pick an era that's got at least like two or three really good real time strategy games in it. It's a key consideration for me.
Had to be a bit of noughties in there.
I'm a bit sad because it just cut me off from Hitman 2 and Hitman 3. There's a lot of like me playing Colorado pretending we're having a good time.
It'd be really funny if you picked a period that got you like Colorado but not Hokkaido. That would be just like you got episode 4 but not 5.
Oh, that would be so cursed.
Incomplete Hitman 1. Not good. That was a fun one.
I enjoyed that. Okay, last question, Matthew. Do you want to read this out?
Is it just the next one? I've just caught up with the latest What We've Been Playing episode and very much enjoyed the Helldivers 2 chat. Have you guys ever considered hopping onto a multiplayer game every once in a while and streaming it?
I don't usually watch Twitch or anything, but I think it would be fun to see the wild anecdotes not so stealthily blowing up your teammates play out in real time, Martin. That is, of course, a reference to you destroying some of your friends in Helldivers 2.
Yeah, it's been good. I've actually let my PS Plus subscription lapse and uninstalled Helldivers 2. It just sort of came and went a little bit with my friendship group.
But that said, I got a message today asking, do you want to play it again after three and a half week downtime? So maybe it's not over. I don't know.
But yeah, I am streaming together, Matthew. So I don't know if we are massive streaming people as such, but I have floated that if we hit three grand on Patreon, that we stream something to its completion, like we do over a series of evenings or something. But I don't know if you have any strong thoughts about this.
Something that everyone hates, God of War 3.
Oh my God, that would actually be really fun. Yeah, I mean, I did think about doing some kind of novelty game where you don't like it. Sort of like one of the Jak and Daxter games or Ratchet or something.
But it probably makes sense to be something that we like. I do like the idea of watching some of the most rancid sort of like deaths in all of gaming and being like, yep, this is one of our favorite games. What are your thoughts on this, Matthew?
Like I just think I'd be very bad at it. I'm not very good at the streaming stuff. I've always struggled with it when I was doing the little streaming that I did on RPS.
Like I would have suffered massively if I hadn't been doing it with Ashley Gurray, who was much like more experienced to that kind of thing. The truth is, the reason I don't stream or have much interest in it is that when I'm playing games, like my head is just empty, like nothing. I'm not thinking anything.
I've just completely like switch off. It's really terrible. And so I don't know where people get that running commentary from or the ability to react.
I just don't react to anything. Like I think it would be quite frightening to watch, it would just be like my dead eyes watching Mario Galaxy.
I think I could only do it with a game that I knew inside and out and could talk.
About and it could just be mega bants because if I did Halo 3 or one of the Metal Gear games or something, I could definitely pass comment on that without really thinking about it. It's like, oh yeah, it's like Otakon's piercing himself, drink, re! I do kind of drinking game thing, I guess.
But multiplayer, the thing is that multiplayer is, that's just you getting shot over and over again or something similar. I mean, yeah, it would be hard to sort of pass comment on it. I am concentrating too hard when I'm playing Apex Legends to stream it, for example.
And even when I do, I am streaming, I am swearing, I'm just going, oh, you motherfucker, it's not good content. It's just, yeah.
No. I know you laughed at when we were playing multiplayer games, because, you know, I was swearing lots, but that's because all the thinking part of my brain was sort of diverting all the energy into concentration. And that's just what's left.
It's just, it's all hollow bullshit. It's funny to listen to for like 10 minutes.
No, it's funny to listen to for two hours. I had a great time. I had a great time.
I could recommend playing Halo or Redfall with Matthew. It's a good time. Yeah, I don't know.
We think about it, I guess.
Yeah, there's an element of just be careful what you wish for. I think you might be disappointed.
I think in some ways we are in the format that suits us the most, you know. Sometimes people ask, why do you have a YouTube channel and film the podcast? I know those TCGS boys, they film the podcast and put it up and...
I can't put my heads in a box.
Yeah, and I find it so daunting to do what they do and comment on the fly. I'm always cutting shit out of this, I think it'll get me in trouble. That happens loads because I've been a PR for two and a half years.
I was thinking about this, in nothing but the character, I think as podcasters go, I'm basically Kevin Spacey in LA Confidential where it's like he's a cop, but he also works in TV, and you're like, you shouldn't be allowed to do both of those things, and that's kind of like what I'm like, basically, I'm like the PR who's also making a games podcast. I'm like, I've got to avoid putting my foot in my mouth as much as possible, and so I require the ability to cut things out up until the last minute in order to sustain that. Do you think that's an apt comparison, Matthew?
Yeah, that's pretty great, actually. Who am I? Am I Danny DeVito?
Wait, I'm enabling you.
Maybe a little bit, yeah, but then what happens to him? He gets killed by the farmer from Babe, doesn't he? Spoiler alert.
He has a bad end time, that character.
He comes in with Babe under his arm.
Who's Ron Rifkin?
If anyone's Ron Rifkin, I'd like to be Ron Rifkin, that'd be alright. I'm certainly not Russell Crowe, and I've got a bit of the righteous narc energy of Guy Pearce. I would definitely narc in Dent Cops, for sure.
Yeah, Guy Pearce is good for you, I think. I think reality, we'd probably both be Guy Pearce on that police force, you know what I mean? Yeah.
But yeah, Kevin Spacey, his character in that, to describe my position in the podcasting world, that's me, basically, it's precarious, just like living between two worlds. Yeah. So I've got to cut things out, dog.
No YouTube channel. Right. Went off the reservation there, didn't we, Matthew?
The podcast has come to an end. We have some more questions here, but I'm going to save them for another episode because it's Monday night and Matthew needs his pasta or whatever Catherine's cooked for him tonight. So I will allow him to go and do that.
But Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
MrBazzle UnderscorePesto on Twitter, MrBazzlePestoNoUnderscore on Blue Sky, where you can see me replying to a now-deleted tweet from someone. A very unsatisfying experience.
They got screen-grabbed and shared on Discord. What a fucking mess. OK, yes, and I'm Samuel W.
Roberts on both Twitter and Blue Sky. And the podcast is Back PagePod on both. And the Patreon is patreon.com/backpagepod.
There's a £4.50 tier. That's two extra podcasts a month. If you think this is good, what a question to ask the listeners.
Matthew, let's get out of here.
