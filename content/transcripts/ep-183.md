Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts. I've just eaten a salmon dinner, and I'm here with Matthew Castle.
Hello. A salmon dinner?
Yeah. Well, you know, it's not that sort of, like, opulent, is it, salmon? It's a widely available fish stuff.
You know, you can go get it from any supermarket, really. Do you think that's opulent for a Monday night?
I think it still has a tinge of opulence to it.
But I got the Market Street Budget salmon, so you basically get, like, a big pile of it that hasn't been de-boned properly for, like, five quid, essentially. So it's like two dinners' worth, but it's sort of, like, it's a bit more precarious. So it's, you know, I have no fancy lifestyle here, Matthew.
But, yeah, enough about salmon. I did want to ask you, what did you think of the Nintendo Direct? Because that's happened since we've...
Was it called a Direct? I don't know what the distinction is between the various terms.
Yeah, they always call it... Yeah, it's just the Nintendo Direct. Yeah, I enjoyed it.
Big surprises. Seems that Nintendo's cracked down on its various leakers, as reported. Over the weekend, they seem to have worked out it was a bloke at YouTube and another bloke internally.
And so we got to have the pleasant surprises of Mario & Luigi, which I'm very excited for. That Zelda puzzle adventure immersive sim thing.
Tables of the Kingdom, I call it.
Which I'm into. And other things that were also good. There was a lot of clag in between it.
For a while, it was looking like it was all going to be a little bit Looney Tunes basketball or whatever it was. And I was like, I'm not sure about this. But I think the big hitters were exciting.
And that little clip to say, yes, Metroid Prime 4 does exist. And looks kind of like Metroid Primes 1 to 3. So expectations set for that.
What did you make of it?
Yeah, I liked it. I was paying attention to the leaks. Not everything was leaked, but they leaked the Ace Attorney Investigations collection, which is obviously a big deal for the likes of you.
You have got a record to say that they are among your least favorite games in the series.
The first one is the worst Ace Attorney game by a long way. And the second one is very overrated by the fandom. But I probably shouldn't kind of course correct too much and say it's bad.
It's not bad. It's good. It's just, as a lot of people are going to discover, it's baggy as hell and it's got about three characters, too many in the main cast.
Right, okay.
But at least we know now what those characters are, I say, meant to be called, but you know, this will be Catcom's localization and not the fan localization. So that's kind of interesting.
What were they called in the fan translations, can you remember? Orange, Orange Fruit Man and names like that.
There was, the one, the character I really hate is like, there's this, there's this like young boy prosecutor slash composer called Something Da Best.
Right.
Like, I'm da best. Yeah. And I thought he was, he was really weak, but he's, I don't think he's called that.
He's got, he's got something really very average now, like Martin Jones or something.
David Lewis.
I've been looking at him going, huh.
Martin Jones.
It's not that. No offence if any of our listeners go, Martin Jones, it's a funny name.
That's funny.
Just not in the Ace Attorney world.
No. Again, that's that thing where, when you call Martin Jones, but it's ostensibly set in Japan, you're like, what are we doing here? You know, Martin Jones San.
I mean, where are we at here? So yeah, that was, that was interesting because that really is every box tick now. That is a complete run of Ace Attorney games on, yeah.
Well, apart from Leighton versus Ace Attorney, right, all the other way around, however it was sold, Matthew, that's the last one, right?
I was amazed to see that one because it's probably, you know, from an asset perspective, the most complicated, because it's not just the sort of static character sprites appearing, you know, in the kind of close up portrait rates as it is in Ace Attorney. You know, it has this sort of pointed click element where they run around these sort of environments. So you get the full sprites and, OK, that's only another sprite set, but it would seem like a bigger challenge to translate that into an HD art style than the other ones, which are, you know, it's kind of, you know, you've got your, as long as you've got your courtroom backing art, you know, that's like 60% of the game done.
And that isn't the case here because there isn't really a court and, you know, you're out having, you know, the second game particularly goes to loads of different locations. So yeah, I mean, it's, yes, it's nice. I hope all of this is leading up to New Ace Attorney.
I still think it's a slightly cursed proposition because, you know, while I enjoyed Great Ace Attorney, I also feel like a little bit sad that Shutokumi is sort of stuck in Ace Attorney land when Ghost Trick showed that he had a lot more to him and the people who had finally really come into their own in Spirit of Justice. The kind of creative lead on that has long left Capcom. So who is the sort of shepherd of Ace Attorney now?
Like if it's Shutokumi, great, but also bad in a way.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing, though. I mean, if you go back to like three years ago or even just before Great Ace Attorney Chronicles came out or was announced, we would never have predicted this would happen. You know, at most you might say that they would port like the 3DS ones and Apollo Justice to Switch and other platforms, but I don't think anyone would have predicted that Great Ace Attorney Chronicles and, you know, the Ace Attorney Investigations games would come across.
That seems like a very unlikely scenario. So that is at least good. If you just discovered these games the last few years and, you know, if you anecdotally the sales seem to be pretty great on those games.
I think a lot of people just hoard them when they go on sale on Switch or Steam or whatever. That bodes well, at least for something, something new. And I mean, even if that does keep, you know, Shootakumi in his, you know, theoretical cupboard as we've discussed many times in this podcast, then I don't know, like you say, curse proposition perhaps.
But I don't know, at least like this movement. I mean, there was definitely a moment in time where it seemed precarious with these things. But when they didn't bother localizing the second Ace Attorney Investigations, that seemed like, oh, shit, we went from this being a surprise success story on DS to this is no longer worth our time or money.
And the same was true with Greatest Attorney Chronicles, what a turnaround for the series. So yeah, I don't know.
I just have to say, I got something completely wrong there. I have no idea why I thought that they changed that guy's name to Martin Charles.
What is his name?
Eustace Winner.
Oh, OK, right. That's not too far from Jonathan DeBest or whatever he was called.
Sebastian DeBest to Eustace Winner. Where did I get Martin Charles? Well, this is just a sign of my ever-crumbling mind.
Martin Jones, my favorite. You're just there when they announced Marvel vs. Capcom 4, saying, where the fuck is Martin Jones in this roster?
And no one knows what you're talking about, Matthew.
Just let me slowly sink into madness and just leave me be.
Just give him his chocolate and leave him in the corner, sort of vibes, yeah. Okay, good stuff. Yeah, I wasn't totally sold on the Zelda that came out of that.
I was a bit like, hmm, okay, that's novel, but does this have the legs basically to sort of support a whole game? But I mean, it has the kind of like tech base, quote unquote, of that Link's Awakening redo from a few years ago. So we can assume that-
You can tell it.
Yeah. Is it running at 20 FPS?
Well, it had a little bit, like you could see some things, you're like, oh yeah, I remember that from Link's Awakening. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same team.
Yeah, well, Grezzo, yeah, that would kind of make sense, wouldn't it? Because, yeah. And you know, I think I would mildly prefer that they make something new as opposed to redo another Zelda because, yeah, like those, you know, they're all available on Switch Online.
You can go play them, the other Zelda games. So it's not like it's pressing to get remakes of all of those. Something new is always preferred to a remake.
I just think it's interesting that they still have a second team, you know, that they're not just all in on mainline Zelda, which you could probably assume from, you know, what they've made in the last few years, and that these less visually ambitious games kind of slot into the handheld sort of Zelda lineage. You know, like, this is, you can sort of see the through line from A Link Between Worlds to The Link's Awakening remake and this. And like, they didn't need to do that.
You know, a lot of the teams, you know, used to have a kind of a handheld and a console team working on all the major franchises, and they've so close together now, you know, because everything's united by the Switch. You don't need to sort of humour both sort of sides. But actually, you know, that's that was the biggest surprise.
Wasn't so much what the game was, but that they are still interested in making original other Zelda games in between, which is exciting.
I suppose, like, there are other examples of this. Games have the kind of handheld mentality, maybe more than a home console mentality. So I would say that the Fire Emblem games are still like that in terms of their production values.
They feel to me like they're on the evolutionary track with the 3DS games. They don't feel like someone's necessarily gone, let's breath of the wild up the Fire Emblem franchise. That feels like it's kind of like budgeted sensibly.
Super Mario Wonder is sort of like in between. It's a bit of home console and a bit of like new Super Mario Bros on a handheld sort of vibes. I think like it crosses the boundary quite nicely, but it's two minute levels.
Yeah.
Almost a bit mobile-y.
Yeah, it's not quite the same as, you know, obviously what Odyssey is selling. Odyssey is a full fat console experience. And also the Mario & Luigi game that they announced, Brother Ship, I think it was called, that's got a very much a handheld vibe as well.
So, yeah, that's a really interesting one, because obviously that was a series that was sort of made and nurtured by AlphaDream who shut down in 2019. So I think it's been said since that people who worked on the Mario & Luigi series, maybe like Nintendo internally, are still working on it. But that's a very different studio.
I think I saw someone quite convincingly making a case on Twitter that it might be like next level games.
All right.
You know, because obviously they've got the Luigi's Mansion 2 port, but that seems quite low lift for that studio. And you know, it's like, is that really all they've done since Luigi's Mansion 3? And I can't remember who it was or really what the argument was, but in scrolling past it for all the 15 seconds, I went, huh, yeah, that could be a thing.
Yeah. So it's Martin, Jones and Luigi, brother ship. Look forward to it later this year.
I'm trying to sort of set the tone for this episode. It's things that are very poorly remembered. It's the poorly remembered special.
Yeah. Okay. Good stuff, Matthew.
So yes, I look forward to those games. I thought for an end of a generation, you know, like directives is a pretty, you know, there's at least like three things I wanted to buy in there. So that's pretty strong, if you ask me.
I look forward to discussing those things another time. So Matthew, we have a What We've Been Playing episode. And, you know, we start with Paper Martin Jones, the Thousand Year Door.
I promise I'll drop that now. So this is pretty funny. This is a redo of a GameCube classic that you have spoken out against the people who-
Whoa, man!
No, no, no, this is accurate. You have spoken out against the people who use this to lord it over all other Paper Mario games.
Okay, that is fair. That is true.
Yeah, and so it's been a source of frustration for you. You never said the game is bad. You said the game is good.
But I'm just curious to know what it's like revisiting this, because I know you've been playing this a lot and perhaps hidden in a room somewhere in your mum's house. I mean, I couldn't really say based on the WhatsApps I've been getting from you. What's the deal with it?
How are you finding this redo so far?
The big exciting thing with this is that it's back at all. Like, it's a game that's quite hard to play in that it only exists in the GameCube original and is now sold for stupid prices that silly people will spend on it. So it's back.
That's great. The thing that kind of surprised me was how good it looked and sounded. I think they've done a really nice pass on it.
I'd probably liken it to the kind of pass that Wind Waker got on Wii U, where it wasn't just, oh, here's Pikmin or here's Metro Primes. Well, actually, Metro Primes may be an unfair one, but it wasn't just an HD kind of sharpening of textures. They've thought a little bit about sort of smoothing out some of the mechanics.
They put some quality of life changes in there, the ability to very quickly change the companions. They've added some extra warp pipes to cut out some of the to and from, which we'll get to in a minute. And crucially, they've given it quite a glow up, I think.
It looks pretty amazing to me. Origami King, which was the previous Switch Paper Mario, also I thought looked pretty sharp. But this one here, maybe some of the areas are less ambitious than Origami King, because it's five Paper Marios ago or whatever, and they've only kind of grown in their kind of artistic ambition since then.
But it's little things like the... there's like a really nice sheen, almost like everything's made of kind of premium wrapping paper. There's like a real like gloss and there's a lot of like reflections in it.
It's a lot of subtle reflection work in this game, which just makes it feel very high quality. The paper models themselves, like the characters, they look a little thicker. They actually look more like cardboard to me.
This is really nitpicky, but, you know, it's Paper Mario, it looks like cardboard Mario. I've not really got a problem with that, it looks great, it looks solid. You know, I feel like you're getting your money's worth with that art pass, for sure.
And the music's fantastic, they've come in, done reorchestrations of all the music. You can buy a badge, which lets you listen to the original soundtrack, if you so wish. But yeah, it just, you know, in terms of just, oh yeah, this feels like very lovingly put together.
Like, Nintendo can kind of fart these ports out if they want, and there's a real sliding scale of quality, I'd say, in terms of actual craftsmanship. This is at the higher end of the scale, which is lovely to see. Going back to it, I think it does feel like a 20 year old game.
Paper Mario is a really interesting series in the way it has evolved. A lot of fans of Thousand Year Door haven't been happy with kind of where the series went, which became more and more experimental, moved further away from its RPG roots, was less interested in a technical battling system, there was no levelling after a certain point. I think Sticker Star onwards, which then raised the question of why do any battling at all.
But kind of against that, I thought there was quite a mad creative streak, certainly in the stories they were trying to tell, and the mad little adventures Mario went on. So coming back to Paper Mario is interesting, coming back to Thousand Year Door is interesting, because it's a big step on the path to where Paper Mario would go, in that every chapter is kind of like a short story. Mario goes to a place, meets a load of weird characters, and I certainly remembered it like that.
Like, when I think of this game, I think, oh, it's the game where Mario does that weird wrestling adventure, or where Mario does the murder on the Orient Express. And it is true, there are those individual adventures, and they are very strong chapters. But it is also like there is quite a lot of weak material in this game, and it is quite early on.
I'm only about halfway through it, so, you know, for the record. But I think the first stretch of this game really shows its age. Like, it's quite, quite boring, the way you kind of go into these environments.
But they're really long. There's all constant walking back and forth between there's a character at one end of the map, and you have to go all the way to the other end of the map to get them a thing, and then just walk all the way back. And there are places they've added new warp pipes to acknowledge that, to sort of cut it out.
But not every place. They could have added way more. In that sense, I think you realize how much heavy lifting the really good chapters maybe did in your memory of this game.
You remember the chapter where Mario joins a wrestling league and has to work his way up through all the ranks of like a big WWE parody, at the same time solving like a dark conspiracy that grips the wrestling arena. And that is just, it's probably like the best bit of the game. It's probably one of the strongest stretches of any Paper Mario.
But they aren't all like that. And playing this game, like a lot of the time I'm like, oh jeez, I wish they were all as good as that bit. There's a lot of quite plodding kind of pedestrian sort of plotting and level concepts in this.
And maybe it's an age thing. I'm slightly over some of the writing in this game. There's just so much of it.
These characters turn on and they, everyone prattles on for like two speech bubbles longer than they should. Very specifically that. Where I always get to a point where I'm like, yeah, I get it.
Like I know what routine you're trying to do. Like there's these three witches and they're a bit like the three stooges. You know, skip.
Here's Bowser. He's going to do some fucking Bowser talk. Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.
Oh, it's the comedy robots who all pray their mad robot leader. Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip. I once relished that stuff.
And in this, I actually do find it slightly interminable.
We are the kings of running jokes into the ground on this podcast, Matthew. I can't believe you wouldn't push for that.
Well, that's, you know, I think maybe we learned from the best Paper Mario. Weirdly, where it's had its funniest are like the little bit characters who say like one line and then fuck off, right? Here's a toad who just reveals the dark psychology of a toad for once and then is gone in a line.
There's particular stretches where there's not as much battling and there's a lot of talking. And I think maybe I've just grown out of it a little bit and that's okay. You know, I think this still has an amazing place as like a My First RPG, you know, it's a great gateway drug for sure.
And way stronger and way more sophisticated and better put together than Super Mario RPG, which I thought was very poor when I replayed it. I'm kind of glad it exists. There's a lot of kind of charm and quality here still, but I'd forgotten some of its bad habits.
I think some of it hasn't aged particularly well. And this isn't just, you know, sticking my nose up at the Thousand Year Door acolytes. You know, I really went in hoping this and when it's at its best, it's amazing.
Like I said, that wrestling chapter, absolutely superb. Everything I want in Paper Mario. And, you know, it has got a slightly more sophisticated combat system.
Not that sophisticated, you know, like it takes a long time to warm up this game because the whole combat system hinges on you buying and applying badges, which basically give you moves. And if you make the mistake of levelling up your health or your flower power and not your badge slots, you actually don't have any moves to use for like long stretches of this game. I had a faint memory of that.
So like I just went in badges, badges, badges, badges, and then you begin to kind of customise your moveset. And in that, it is definitely more of an RPG and more sophisticated than what followed in Paper Mario. But I still think there's a version of this game where people don't necessarily recognise that.
And they just end up one hammer and one jump for just a little bit too long to be entertaining.
Interesting. Do you think there's not maybe a sense with this that sometimes you can only enjoy the same joke once? And when you go back to it, it's inevitably going to have a different feeling to it.
Like, I'll rewatch like a comedy film or a sitcom I like, but sometimes it's kind of like watching it for the sort of warmth of something I remember, as opposed to, you know, it being able to get the same effect out of you like the second or third time. Do you know what I mean? Like you said, maybe a sense of been there, done that, because you have literally been there, done that with this.
Yeah, that might be true. Like, I've played it twice before, like I played it again. I wrote a piece for Edge, did like a hundred and one games to play before you die.
I did the Thousand Year Door entry for that and so replayed it to kind of refresh it. And I don't remember feeling this way then, even though I was coming to it for a second time. I don't know.
I didn't feel that way about Origami King, but again, like, maybe that was just because it was all fresh and I hadn't seen any of those gags. Like, these games like to talk. And the problem is, critics started…
you know, they review very well because of their very sharp and, you know, weird localisation, but I felt like they began to lean into that more and more. Like, Super Paper Mario was, you know, which came directly after Thousand Year Door, was like, notoriously talky. I mean, that game just never shut up and became quite hard work as a result.
It might just be that it's quite kiddy-ish, you know, it's, oh, I'll get you, Mario! It's that kind of Saturday morning, and increasingly as I get older, like, it really grates with me. I'm being a grump about it, I'm afraid.
You know, I'm enjoying it from a perspective of, like, you know, the bits that I like, and I'm going to definitely play it through to the end, but I'm very convinced of my stance on Thousand Year Door now.
So that's the second Mario RPG that has not met your expectations that you've played in the last six months. Is that right? Yeah.
I also wonder if its combat system is fundamentally, like, a bit of a dead end. The kind of quick time event combat. It's really exciting to begin with, because you're learning all the timings, you're working out almost like the puzzle element of everything you meet, but there inevitably comes a point in the level where you've seen every enemy type one too many times, and you're just going through the motions, and actually then having to hit all those button presses to kind of, you know, timing your defenses or playing little mini games to do your special attacks, they become so rote that you just, you begin to really resent them.
You're like, I'd actually just like to mash through this combat, I've proven that I know how to fight these fucking dry bones or whatever, you know. I don't want to have to be so on for something which is so, like, boring to me now. But that is just part of it, and I think all of these games do hit that point eventually.
It's just that it's happening, like, sooner and sooner. Like, I almost understand why they reinvented their combat system so dramatically and allowed you to avoid combat, because they know deep down that this combat system just isn't broad enough to sustain a 30-hour game, and that you may not like what the combat system was in Origami King, but at least it wasn't doing this fucking thing again, which we've done too many times. At this point, they've done it in Super Mario RPG, Paper Mario, and then Thousand Year Door.
I think you can draw a line under it. Mario and Luigi RPGs have the same combat system, but I feel like they throw a few more wrinkles in, and that will be the big test for me. Like, if I bounce off Mario and Luigi, then maybe this genre of Mario game, which I once absolutely adored, is just, like, I'm just a little bit over it, and that will be sad, but that, you know, these things happen.
I guess, like, no one associates this strain of Mario game with innovation in that genre, right? Or at least they haven't done for a long time, because this is now such a well-known... The QTE combat system thing is just so, you know, so familiar.
So yeah, I don't know, it's sort of like... Is Japanese RPG innovation sort of coming from elsewhere, isn't it, really? It's coming from Atlus or, you know, maybe Square Enix, depending on how you look at it, and you know what I mean?
Yeah, but maybe what spoils this a little bit is, you know, Plague Sea of Stars, which has this QTE system, but it also has a lot of other combat systems which you have to engage with. There's like the push and pull of like when you can do the moves, like when you kind of store up power, when you when you attack, and it just feels much richer for it as a combat system. This is just, yeah, you just have to hit the buttons to amplify everything.
It's quite a basic system, but with these extra button presses on top, and maybe there is like a limit to how complicated a Mario RPG can be because they fundamentally want it to be a gateway drop. But it will never be a, I was about to say a serious RPG, but that's not quite what I mean. But I don't think it will ever be a real contender or something that makes you properly have to kind of think, because I don't think they want it to be.
They want you to enjoy all the silly jokes and go on the mad adventure. That's why I don't really see the difference between Thousand Year Door and What Follows. None of them are about, oh, you can't, you know, this game's too hard, you can't finish it.
They want you to get through it and enjoy the silliness they put on for you. And the idea that one is more sophisticated than the other, I just don't really buy it. That is my stance.
It doesn't seem to be a popular one from reading the reviews. I've seen plenty of people being like, oh, it's the Mario you love, 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10. And I'm like, okay, if, you know, if this is that much of a happy memory for you, then lucky you.
It was for me once.
Wow. Okay, there you go. Good stuff.
So, yeah, Matthew Castle, the 20 year take, it's, it's good. I guess it's a more recent take, so that doesn't quite work. But nonetheless, I do have this, Matthew, and I will play it because it's so revered.
And I thought, well, there it is. They have brought it out and Switch again. Why not buy it twice?
I've already paid ridiculous money for it the first time.
So, you bought two Switch copies for your one GameCube copy.
Well, I meant to get to this, but I just, I got immersed in the Dragon's Dogma 2 end game instead. So, basically, I played something like 80 hours of that in the end, so it was a sizeable amount and I'm done with it now, but casualty of the podcast is me not having played Paper Mario. But I appreciate your detailed thoughts on this, Matthew.
You spent longer thinking about this than pretty much anyone. So, you know, I think anyone who, anyone who sort of like finds your take, you know, like contentious or whatever, like that is the thing to bear in mind. It's like you, you honestly do have deeper thoughts in this than most people are going to, you know.
So, it is what it is.
But yeah. Annoying thoughts rather than deep. I'm desperately trying to find someone who will let me review Marion Luigi for them because I reviewed most of that series, you know, and I'd love to, I'd love to take a, take a swing at a new one and just get into it.
Yeah, that's it. Are you a commissioning editor listening to this podcast? And get in touch with Matthew Castle.
Yeah, I don't really know what I was trying to attempt there.
MrBassLoverSchoolPesto at gmail.com, just get in touch if you can sling Matthew 120 quid and a copy of, yeah, Brothership on Switch. That'd be Jim Dandy. Okay, good.
Excellent. So with that out of the way, Matthew, we go on to move on to Still Wakes the Deep, the newest game from the Chinese room, who it's been a little while since they've made a game that you would probably associate with their most celebrated lineage of games. So they've been making other games, they made a game called Little Orpheus for Apple Arcade.
They made another game that I have forgotten the name of that was also I think like a mobile game first. But essentially they are best known still for making Dear Esther, Amnesia, Machine for Pigs, a spin-off of that series from Frictional, and also Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, which we talked about in this podcast before, I believe. So they are first-person, quote-unquote, walking sim games, but with sort of atmospheric, but they have dabbled with horror as well.
There's a bit of horror in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. There's a lot of horror in Amnesia, Machine for Pigs, so this is part of their lineage. But the studio's been through a lot since then.
It's been bought by Sumo Digital, and this game is being published by Secret Mode, who are responsible for a game that Matthew enjoys, Timefire, aka Eternal Threads. So it feels like it's their biggest budget creation, by far, I would say. In terms of the presentation, you never met any characters in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or Dear Esther.
It was very much about landscapes and audio tapes and storytelling being delivered via other means. They were very well-produced games. I would say that in a lot of ways, The Walking Simulator, we talked about this before, kind of peaked with What Remains of Edith Finch, and then after that, I don't think there were many places to really go with it.
This game, I would say, is borderline a walking simulator, but you could also call it a horror game as well. It's a very simple horror game, I would say, but in some ways, I think it walks right down the middle there. This is a game set in the 1970s on an oil rig called the Bearer D.
This is in the North Sea, I believe. So you've got Scottish characters basically working across this rig. And your character, Cameron Cas McCleary, is essentially con on the run.
He's had an altercation, essentially, and has abandoned his wife and two children to go and work on this oil rig. A bit of a chancer electrician trying to basically run away from his problems. On this rig, after a short sort of preamble where you meet some of the characters who live here, the drill on the rig burrows into something supernatural and all hell breaks loose.
And the game could fairly be described as heavily inspired by The Thing, John Carpenter's film. It's very much in that vein, I would say. But at the same time, with a primarily Scottish cast, it has a very unique flavor, both among sort of horror media at large, but also in video games.
It feels like the kind of setting and the types of characters you don't really encounter elsewhere. I am very much enjoying it. I'm over halfway.
I think I'm in the maybe the final third or getting close to it, something like that. It's not super long. It's on Game Pass.
You could also play it on Steam and PS5. The flavor of it is a large part of the magic to me. As a game, I find it relatively, it's simple, but in a way that doesn't really offend me.
I don't think it ever wants you to interrogate one section for too long or to think about its mechanics in that much depth. I think it wants to keep you moving, keep the momentum of the story going. It has some, I think, great monster design, a few really distinctive characters in it, and some phenomenal voice acting.
And it's well worth a play, in my opinion, Matthew, but what do you think?
Yeah, I'm about the same way through it as you. I actually had a bit of a save file to do and it put me back to the start, which was annoying. But what I like about it is it has the same kind of eye for very nuanced environmental detail that you would expect from the makers of Rapture.
But it has, you know, a bit more kind of momentum to it. One of the things I actually found quite frustrated about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture was this constant worry that I was like missing stuff. And so I just endlessly kind of trudged around this sort of semi open map, trying to find all the story content because that's really what there was to enjoy.
And I like that this puts you on a strictly linear path, like everything you are going to see everything they've prepared for you, like minimum of fuss. And I think that's quite a strong kind of delivery method for good writing, good character art, good environmental design. You know, you're going to see all these rooms.
It's very, very hard, you know, maybe apart from that opening section to really miss anything. It's got quite thin stealth horror mechanics. A lot of like hiding in cupboards and throwing hammers while things sort of run off.
And I've died lots of times where I thought I probably shouldn't have, which was annoying. I've seen people say it's Alien Isolation on an oil rig, but I think Alien Isolation has like a way more going for it, like mechanically, it's thinking about a lot more things. This wants you to see it through to the end, is my feeling.
Yeah, it's a choice to make it simpler, I would say, it's not.
Yeah, definitely. I really like the design of whatever the threat is. It pulls a lot from like oil slicks, but it's also very organic.
There's kind of a tendril, tentacle element to it. It looks clearly off the sea, but it kind of has like an oily glaze to it and gives off this very strange light. The kind of monster, the kind of the structure of the monster sort of projects this almost like disco ball effect onto all the walls, makes it very dreamy.
Like it's truly alien in nature, which is really striking. I think the monster design is actually like much more horrible than they thought it was going to be. They haven't shown that stuff.
They've been very kind of locked down on that. And I remember the Edge preview kind of talks around it a lot and, you know, like, was it a monster? Is it sort of possessed oil rig workers?
Actually it's, you know, something quite bizarre, I think.
Yeah, it's sort of like, I think the Edge feature did say the thing. And I think that is the kind of, like, that's a fair touch point to going in.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't think that spawns anything to go with that expectation. But yeah.
The one thing I do keep thinking playing it is, was at one point the monster or a threat a bit more subtle or less monstrous? Because there's quite a lot of dialogue where he talks about other people, like, I just bumped into so-and-so and he's going mental down in the kitchen deck. But like, and like, skip ahead 30 seconds if you really don't want any spoilers.
What he's talking about was like, a head with tentacles? It's so far removed from the man that it once was. That I'm like, you wouldn't say that to someone.
You wouldn't go, oh my god, something's wrong with Renick. You'd go, fucking Renick is now a giant head with tentacles. It isn't Renick anymore.
Like, he's so calm in the way he talks about the mad thing he's just seen. I do wonder, like, was it always that? Was it ever a time where it was a more, like, human shape?
I could see that, but I prefer the choice they've made. I think it's...
Oh yeah, it's definitely right. I just think there's something very funny the way that they persist in calling the creatures by the names of the person they once were when they are now very beyond human.
Yeah, yeah.
Like, if I met your head and it was just walking around on stalks, I wouldn't be like, oh, that's Samuel. You know, it would be like...
Sam's having a tough day, and it's like, and I'm literally like some kind of flesh monster. Yeah.
There's been a couple of beats where I'm like, oh, that seems odd. But it's, yeah, it's certainly exciting. It really makes brilliant use of the oil rig.
Like it's a great setting, like a really fucking good setting.
The fact that there's all that churning ocean below that, you know, scenes which could be a bit, you know, might get dinged in another game, like the kind of quite limited platforming. Just the fact that it's happening over this churning ocean, that makes it just a little bit more interesting. And they do a lot of good stuff with the camera.
You're looking down and you're just like, oh shit, I'm really stuck up on this horrible building.
I'm just a normal Scottish bloke doing it. There's no, I'm not a superhero in any way. I don't have any guns or anything like that.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. It's, I am enjoying it greatly.
Yeah. I think I've reached some of the points where I think people were maybe, maybe become, became a bit unstuck with it. So there's some underwater sections that are a little bit more demanding.
Like, I don't think like it's a game where you get stuck for a long time. I can only think of a couple of times, but there's probably been like a few monster encounters where I've died three or four times. And like you, I'm not entirely sure why that's happened.
But I've also had some where I've just managed to slip right past them. It's not been like a big deal at all. And it's a very rudimentary stealth.
It's not complicated. It really is throw something elsewhere and then watch this very cursed visage move against the lights across the room, which is a fucking great effect. And then that's basically what the stealth is.
So the setting is great. I think also I like the very alien style. People will always like the kind of like men working for the man, working class people working for a corporation and like, oh, the boss, am I right?
People love that kind of stuff, right? You know what I mean? It's got like Union talk, which, you know, Gen Z millennials love that shit.
All that stuff is like, I think, well judged. It's again, like drawing from Alien there. They are truckers in space, essentially, where something cursed happens to them.
Again, very similar. But I think it is just the originality of that setting and the characters you meet that you just wouldn't meet anywhere else. And the fact that you're playing a character who's got some like personal trouble, but there's no glamour about it.
It's just he's just from obviously like working class, quite poor and obviously like a troubled man. But it's very different to like, you know, what is Booker DeWitt sort of like doing? He's trying to get back his daughter who was stolen by himself from a fucking another timeline.
He lives in the sky in a city like, you know, it's so it's just so much more grounded than that. And I think that's just I just love the decision making behind that. It got me thinking a bit about the approach to stealth got me thinking a bit about Amnesia, the bunker which came out last year.
That's a lot closer to Alien Isolation than this is. That's a game that's got light mechanics and like it's got sort of resource management and, you know, sort of like sound has an impact on how you play. And you can upward increase the difficulty or decrease difficulty and it will enhance the survival horror nature of the game.
This is just so much simpler than that. So, yeah, I don't know. It's a limited suite of things that you do as well.
Like if you're a big fan of when Raiden has to like turn like a hatch in Metal Gear Solid 2, you're going to love this game. There's a lot of like hatch turning in this game. Like you say, there's a bit of like platforming.
There's a bit of like putting out fires. There's a bit of swimming later on. Maybe there's some more mechanics are not encountered yet.
But yeah, but it's only about like five or six hours locked.
So that's the thing. There's there's never enough of it. They are like, ah, this and it is quite well paced in that they're like you're locked in with like one man shaped threat and then you'll be outside and there'll be something quite big and weird that you have to deal with.
And then you're on to the next set piece. You know, I don't want to bring up, you know, like Half Life or anything. It's not quite like that, but it has that similar eye for, oh, well, let's make sure you're, you're always doing something new every 10 minutes.
Let's make sure there's not too much of the same thing in a row. And by doing that, things which are, you know, quite thin or shallow, you kind of get away with it because they become palate cleansers. Like having a little bit of automated platforming is quite nice when you've just spent 20 minutes crawling around in vents while a lump of Scottish meat sort of shrieks at you.
Yeah, I would say I really love the monster design there. So I really think it's like it's not necessarily original. It's like it's not that scary a game, I would say.
Like it's not terrifying.
I find it quite scary.
Well, I don't find it like so scary. It's like I get freaked out when a monster turns up. But it's a lot of like, I would say, thrilled awe of me looking at these things and being like, what the fuck is that?
Which is also a great effect that a horror game can have, you know.
They maintain enough of their former selves in their dialogue that you kind of hear echoes of whatever their relationship with Kaz was before. And they kind of repeat things and they kind of shout things designed to specifically unnerve him. Like deep down they sort of remember, oh, you know, he has a family, so I'll kind of make comments about his family to him.
And there is something really grim about that. There's like enough of the person, whether it's physically, there's like a bit of their face in their mix still, a lot of big heads in this game, yeah, big heads, screaming, things which are like half nonsensical and a half actually quite winding in really great Scottish accents.
Yeah, yeah, I really like that about it. I think the other choice it makes, which I do like, is that at the start of the game, it could be, it would have been really easy for them to do a very prolonged Pat the Ox style sequence where you meet everyone, hang out, it's snooker night and everyone plays snooker and you basically do a lot of like, you know, a lot of storytelling happens to you and you're not really participating, but instead it's very, very light. It's kind of like, here's Roy, he's the cook, he's your pal and then here's Finlay, they're an engineer and then it's like, and then here's all these Scottish dudes and they're kind of like, they're kind of like a morass of them.
You don't really meet them in like great detail, you know, apart from the boss, they're quite hard to remember who each of them are. But all those choices feel deliberate, it kind of gets straight to the point quite quickly, I would say. Yeah, lots of good, I think lots of good choices in that.
I think if you can, if you have your expectations in check, as a survival horror game, it's not going to have loads of substance to it. This is a game that will show you lots of cool shit in the running time. It won't waste your time.
And like I say, it's the voice acting, it's the fact that people are speaking in like Scottish slang and, you know, I tweeted this, I do apologize, but I feel like Scottish Twitter has prepared me quite well for this game, Matthew. I feel like, you know, people saying, boar bag, you know, I'm just like, that's, that's the kind of thing I've been prepping for for about 10 years. So that's, um, this is, following Andy Kelly has primed me quite well for this.
So, uh, yeah, anything more to say on this, Matthew? Like, um, how do you, what do you make of the Scottish side of it? I think that is a really appealing specific palette.
I think it's very funny that it has subtitles which are one-to-one what the characters are saying and then alternative English subtitles for this is what this slang means in traditional English. That makes me laugh, uh, that they, that they felt the need to put it in. Even though some of these characters, you only meet them for like 10 seconds when, when things are good.
And then, you know, 30 seconds when things are bad. There's a lot of distinct voices in there, like the thoroughness that Chinese room bring to these games and they're like eye for detail just means that everything kind of registers no matter how kind of small it is, particularly in the performances, the range of voices. There's quite a few voices that you'll recognize as well from TV, which is always, always fun.
Your best mate is Sean Dooley. He's not Scottish. He's from Barnsley, I think.
Yeah, some good Barnsley FC gags in there, I would say.
Yeah, but that's the thing, like that they kind of adapted their scripts to fit the characters, like where they come from. Like that's, that's just a sort of a thoroughness that you just don't, you just don't really get anywhere else. And it is really interesting seeing them apply that to NPCs and living humans rather than kind of hinted at in Ghostly Whispers in Rapture or whatever.
So, yeah, yeah, like, I like it. It's definitely not like the undoing of Chinese Room for me. Like it's a, you know, probably the thing of theirs I've enjoyed the most.
So, you know, I hope there is more like this in their future.
I think I agree. It's also, it feels like a lot more money has been spent on it as well. Like there are set pieces in this, you know, there are, you know, visually spectacular surprises in a way that, you know, they just couldn't really do in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or Dear Esther.
So, yeah, I really like it. I think it's a really great, it's a step forward in presentation, even if gameplay wise, it's sort of like maybe a step sideways. Maybe that's a fair way of putting it, yeah, but that's absolutely fine.
Like I say, on Game Pass as well, basically the perfect Game Pass game, right? It's like you'll finish it in a weekend and, you know, it slots in to your schedule of no doubt fucking, you know, eight 100 hour games that require like going around to open worlds performing ridiculous side quests. This is like such a nice palette cleanser to that.
So, yes, great stuff, Matthew. Okay, Matthew, your final game is 1000 X Resist, a narrative based game that I've been keeping an eye on because it was in this wave of like May Indies where everyone was like, oh my god, there are so many fucking games. And this was among them.
I feel like this probably lost out the most from like mainstream attention, but the people who love this game really love it. So what do you make of it?
Yeah, it's on Switch and PC. It kind of came to my attention as one of those games that was overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam and quite healthy numbers of them. But I hadn't really read many mainstream reviews.
I mean, what tends to happen is if those games get big enough, they do eventually break out and get reviewed. So I know Eurogamer reviewed it. I think there's a review on IGN.
I hadn't really read the reviews. Like I've been trying to kind of sort of go in blind. I thought this was going to be like a murder mystery in that the little image or clip I'd seen of it was someone getting stabbed and the art style is like a little bit kind of sort of Danganronpa-y and it has, you know, a sort of anime sounding name, this Thousand Times Resist.
So I thought, oh, is this going to be loads of people locked in a building solving weird mysteries? Basically a Zero Escape or a Danganronpa. It isn't really that.
It's a guided narrative experience. You can see a world where this is a visual novel. It's not though.
It's a 3D character moving through a 3D space. It uses lots of different perspective shifts. So sometimes it's third person, sometimes it's first person.
It almost makes it feel like a kind of walking simulator. Sometimes you're in these quite big environments. Sometimes you're in very small, like, narratively guided environments.
What unites it is a technique of jumping through memories and flicking through time. You know, from what I've played, which again, I think I'm about halfway through. Most of the gameplay part of the game hinges on switching between different time states to find the period of time where you can physically access a certain room.
So if in the future, a room is blocked off, if you go into the past, the room isn't. You go into the room, you flip back to the future, you can find out what happened in that room. So there's like a light navigational puzzle, but that's sort of by the by.
I don't think that's what you're really here for, which is a kind of strange sci-fi story, which takes quite a long time to bed in and bring you in. Certainly did with me anyway. You seem to be in the far distant future.
Society seems to be made up of clones of this sort of goddess character, who is the character seen being stabbed right at the start of the game. The journey we are led to believe is how the character who stabbed this goddess. What is it that she learns about this goddess that brought her to this act?
Is what I'm going to assume the game is about so far. Like there's still a lot of mystery about. I wouldn't say it's as like punchy and obviously fun as a Danganronpa or a Zero Escape, which really lay out all their stakes and rules and are very tightly plotted.
Like this feels like a game where there's a lot of room for interpretation and working out just what is going on. And I imagine it won't be until they're in that all those puzzle pieces start together. But you are going into the history of your goddess, the All Mother, and seeing key moments from her life.
These sort of memory dives are kind of taught as scripture. Like as part of your religious upbringing in this future society, you have to learn kind of how she became who she was. Those moments in the past are a lot more grounded.
Like they're in the not too distant future, but seem to have quite a lot of ties to current political upheaval in Hong Kong. So there's a lot of stuff about her family sort of emigrating to Canada. You know, I'm going to admit, it's not something I'm hugely clued up on.
If you read the Eurogamer review, which was written by Alexis Ong, who writes very well about this stuff and has way more knowledge about these things and really wrote about it from that perspective, you know, that was a bit of an eye-opener in terms of, oh, okay, like a lot of this did go over my head, actually. But you know, there's enough there that you can kind of piece together what happened to this girl, what happened to her family, and you know, the path it sets you on, that is going to eventually lead to this crime in the future. Which is a long rambling way of saying it's quite a slow novelistic game, which I think you have to accept that you're not going to understand it for quite a long stretch of time, or that there's going to be stuff which is quite baffling and is deliberately so, which isn't normally, you know, me, I'm quite, you know, I like my quite black and white sort of mechanical storytelling of crime novels and things.
This is a lot more kind of dreamy and sort of ambiguous, but I am enjoying it. It's certainly got its hooks into me. Like I'm past the point of no return in terms of like being invested in this story.
Like you know, I want to know how it plays out. And I do think it is interesting that they have tried to tell it in a more sort of involving kind of traditional sort of 3D third person style than just a visual novel. Like this could have been a far smaller indie affair if it wanted to be, but it's, you know, it's trying to do a bit more.
So it's, yeah, it is interesting and the love for it and how, how just completely people seem to be on board in those glowing steam reviews, you know, suggests that it does stick the landing. So whether or not it does it and be one of the top 10 games of the year or whatever, I don't know yet, but I'm certainly intrigued to see where it goes.
Yeah, I didn't really know it had that political dimension to it. That's probably the thing that intrigues me the most out of, like to look at, it looks like it's got a bit of a near automata visually.
Yeah, there is.
A little bit of that.
Yeah, and in a similar way, I guess that you have to kind of piece together that story. Yeah, I'd say if you could sort of gel with that, this will probably work for you as well.
Yeah, interesting. Yeah, I sort of like, I think it's got like, it's one of those games I think it's done all right, but not amazingly. So I think that it probably does need the push.
I imagine this will end up in a lot of like, personal best of lists towards the end of the year. It's got that kind of profile about it, you know?
I will say, I think the Switch version for something which is quite minimalist visually is quite rough looking. It reminds me a bit of what happened with Rain Code last year, which had a similar thing. Just, I don't know what engine it used or whether it's a particularly good fit, but you have to kind of accept that there's some quite rough looking stuff going on and you have to kind of get over that quite quickly.
You know, I imagine that's not a problem on PC or Steam Deck, say. It also has the kind of central hub that you return to in the future when you're not in these sort of memory journeys. It's like a little bit too big and a little bit too confusing to navigate to be like truly enjoyable because the idea is that between each journey you can go and meet the other kind of clones of the All Mother and talk to them and, you know, it's not essential that you talk to them, but it kind of fleshes out the world.
But trying to find them, it's like an even messier version of a Bioware story hub. You know, it's a bit like, you know, the castle in Inquisition or even the Citadel maybe is a better thing of just like, oh, where does this fucking lift go? Who does this connect to?
And then you go up to the place and the character isn't where you think they're going to be and you're like, oh, this is a, this is like, that wouldn't happen in a visual novel because you just strip out all the interaction. So it's just the story delivered as efficiently as possible. Here is a little bit of footwork between them, which is where the game is at its weakest.
Okay, interesting. Well, I will probably check this out at some point when it's probably off the back of a Steam sale or something. But I'll certainly check in with you to see how you, what you make of the ending, Matthew, and see if it does stick the landing as you say.
Interesting. Well, we're doing our best to keep on top of the Indies this year, aren't we, despite the avalanche of long blockbusters? Well, that ceased for a little while, but kick off again in September.
So nice to enjoy this pause and catch up on some stuff. So I've been playing Mullet Madjack on PC. This game...
I have not heard of this. I read this in a document and was like, what the fuck is this?
This is reviewed by, I think, Kotaku and Rock Paper Shotgun reviewed this. Maybe a couple of other outlets picked it up. Maybe I first read about it on PC Gamer, I can't remember.
But this game is, I would say, a mix between... It's inspired a bit by Hotline Miami, inspired a bit by SuperHop. It's a first-person shooter where you're going through these, I would say, procedurally generated sets of tunnels in this level.
You're sprinting through this tunnel, mashing through enemies to get to the finish. And the idea is you're going up all these floors to rescue this, quote-unquote, influencer princess. So it has a bit of that kind of like Gen Z energy about it, I would say.
But the graphics are actually, I would say, much more 90s anime inspired. It does have a kind of like VHS anime sort of aesthetic in the menus and stuff like that. It's very, very bright, beautiful looking graphics.
And it's basically a game of dashing through these corridors, booting enemies into, it's got a really nice kick button, kicking enemies into objects that kill them, like electricity grids and things like that, and bits of glass and into some acid and things like that. And you're counting down at all times, like there's like 10 seconds left. And then you will die at the time it reaches zero.
So basically, you got to keep your sort of adrenaline going by killing enemies. And by killing enemies in certain ways, you get a certain amount of seconds back. So you basically have to always be comboing different enemy kills, basically.
And so you'll have like, you know, a pistol, there are other weapons you unlock, like an ice katana, fire katana. There's a shotgun, there's an Uzi, yeah, there's a plasma gun as well. And loads of different sort of bonuses you unlock between floors as well.
You kind of like, stack them up and there's a bit of a rogue-like structure. If you fail, you have to go back 10 to the, basically every 10 floors, it kind of checkpoints, basically. You go back to the last checkpoint, start again.
Let's say you're on floor 49 and you die, you go back to floor 41 and then work your way back up. But the levels are really short. They're like one minute long at most.
Sometimes you'll finish them in like 30 seconds, 20 seconds. You can just finish a level by dashing through it. You don't have to kill every enemy.
It's really about muscling through to the finish line. And some of the bonuses are really cool as well. So what I like about it is that you can, let's say you get like an Uzi and it's a bit of a lightweight.
The bullets aren't very powerful. But then you unlock this sort of ricochet chance where your bullets can suddenly start spitting around in this like little metal tunnel that you're fighting these enemies in. And you could do far more damage.
Or you might get a bonus that like adds, you get like an extra second for every head shot that you get or an extra second for every nut shot that you get, as in shoot them in the balls kind of thing.
Thanks for the clarifying.
No problem, pal. Or the ball bag, as Steel Wakes are Deep has taught us. And yeah, I think that it's sort of like quite an intoxicating mix.
It's a really, really exciting game to play. I played through like two and a half hours without really blinking. And I've got most of the way through the campaign, but there's like a bunch of endless modes in it.
And they obviously want you to replay it with these different weapons and see how you can do out of it. And then the levels just add more and more sort of like interesting obstacles to it. So you get these billboards that you can do like a wall run across.
And then towards the end of the game, the settings become a little bit more exterior and you're in kind of like these cyber-punky cities and stuff like that. And there are these boss battles as well, right? It seems more of a, I would say like Doom 2016 kind of like vibe where there's, you're sort of fighting them and you're kind of sprinting around them in a sort of circle, trying to take down a health bar and avoiding these sort of projectile attacks and things like that.
And it can sort of like change tones quite quickly. But the meat of it is just like basically comboing all of these different enemy deaths while sprinting through this sort of like this tunnel. You get these finisher attacks where you can fully replenish.
You like pick up a machete off of a table and you like just jam it into like a robot's head and then you fully replenish your sort of seconds and you can keep going. There's a lot of like near deaths and like coming back from the brink of peril basically and things like that sort of thing. And I think it's got a lot of energy to it and I'm quite enjoying it.
Have you looked this up since I've mentioned it? I did put it in the Google Docs. I wondered if you might have a look at what it is on Google Steam.
I looked at some screenshots of it. I'm trying to gauge how like difficulty wise is it quite like twitchy. In my head, I'm picturing something like Ghost Runner.
You're meant to die a million times over or is it a bit more sort of forgiving and fun than that?
I thought it was going to be like that but it's way more forgiving. It's not massive on like super, super accuracy. Use a lot of like fudging it, I would say.
And a lot of like, oh, I kicked this enemy and he fell into three other enemies. I blew up this barrel and it killed three enemies. And it's just a bit of like, it's these tunnels of like messy chaos, basically, where yeah, it's not like it lacks a precision of something like Superhot or Hotline Miami.
And I would say it works against it in the sense of like, sometimes it feels like the game is slightly beyond your control. Like you're just a participant in these sort of like, setting off these chain reactions of just violence and death. But then at the same time, it does have a nice sense of momentum to it.
And sometimes you'll just like, miss like three enemies at the end, but like slide, do like a little slide through to the end of the floor. And it would just feel quite satisfying. And it seems quite content to let you play the way you want to play.
Yeah, difficulty wise, it's not that taxing. I've managed to get through it pretty quickly. At first I was overthinking it.
I was trying to kill every enemy and just be quite methodical. And then it's just not that game. It's very much like smash through it however you want to, get to the end, find a combination of weapons that work, upgrade your weapons so they have different damage bonuses or abilities or whatever it might be.
I would say the one thing that works against it is that because you don't have that precision that you get from a Superhot or a Hotline Miami, I would say that there's probably a shorter shelf life to it. Like I don't know that you would want to... Hotline Miami is a game I've come back to over and over again.
Superhot is the same actually. It's just there's something about repeating that experience with more finesse that is incredibly rewarding. And this doesn't have enough finesse to necessitate that sort of approach to it.
And even with all the different weapons, I feel like I would pretty much have seen everything I wanted to see by the time I get to the end of this run, which is meant to be like, I think it's like, probably three hours in total to get through it. Like I might have a go on the endless mode, but I don't know if it has that longevity to sort of keep things going.
It looks cool. I've just been watching a little video of it, like the kind of sort of 3D, but 2D things, really, really impressive.
Yeah.
Some quite gnarly bits where you get up close, you do like a melee attack with a sword on the head. And like, you can see like the frames of animation. It looks, it looks, yeah, it looks really well drawn.
Yeah, the production values are a bit higher than you might think they're going to be. Like even the cutscenes look pretty good. And yeah, some of the bonuses you get for weapons are cool.
Like with the Ice Katana, you can unlock an ability that actually deflects bullets. So that's when you swipe it in midair and then it will tell you on screen when you've deflected bullets and that sort of thing. And it's, yeah, it does look really, really nice.
And I think that's one of the treats of playing. It's a bit of a sugar rush of a game. I think it's very much inspired by a game called Post Void that looked a bit like this, but was going for more of an original, maybe like a 90s FPS aesthetic.
This is a bit more kind of like, I guess a little bit of Void Bastards in there, that game. And then there's a lot of Duke Nukem to the character. Sort of like, he's got like anime Duke Nukem vibes, I would say.
Is it too anime if you're not into anime?
No, not really. It's sort of like, that stuff is quite superficial. At first, I thought there were going to be loads of cutscenes of this woman who's like, oh, you're live streaming, you're live right now.
And I thought there's going to be a lot of that, but it's not really. It scales right back. You just get some weird enemies.
But that kind of feels like it's a superficial touch rather than something that kind of hits you over the head over and over again.
It looks like it could exist in the world of Paradise Killer.
Yeah, that seems about right. It's that sort of thing of Western studios making games with anime or manga influences. It's resulted in some pretty cool stuff.
That's a good way of looking at it. The other thing I was going to mention is something that's quite cool. Another game that I've been meaning to check out that I have bought is you can get this and Sulaco, that sort of like GZ Doom, sort of like a first-person shooter that came out recently that people seemed to really like.
I think it's in early access at the moment. People seem quite big on the level design in it. You get that and this in a pair, I think, for about 30 quid or something.
That seems like a pretty good offering. I would say that if you get this around 10 quid though, it's sort of like that would be spot on for it. It feels like it's got definitely that much worth of fun in it.
I do recommend to anyone who just hears the name Mullet Madjack and can't really picture what it is and maybe it sounds a bit too strange, just watch it because you'll probably be quite taken with how it looks, I would say.
Yeah, it looks really cool. It looks like it could be a head fuck if they ever did a VR version.
Oh, yeah, I mean, that would just be like the end of someone basically. Just put it off of their eyes, just gone. Just empty sort of sockets basically.
The last thing I was going to talk about, Matthew, a game I think you've played as well, which is Crow Country on PC.
I haven't quite finished it though, so...
Oh, I'm nowhere near finishing it. I'm really like an hour and a half in, something like that. I had a Sunday where I basically just played all three of these games back to back.
It was a great Sunday, I'll be honest. I had a really good time. It was nice to catch up on some stuff.
A game very much inspired by the sort of like heyday of 90s fixed camera perspective horror games. They're not exactly the same thing. It has pre-rendered backgrounds and then these 3D character models that I would say don't really look like what the PS1 era of horror games looked like.
It's not quite in the same spirit. But everything else is from the sound effects to the way the setting, which is like this Crow-themed theme park basically. That's what it is, isn't it?
Like a kind of like fantastical, strange theme park that you investigate. It just looks and sounds apart. If you have any appreciation for those games, it will make you yearn for them.
It will make you miss them. But it does have, it does do things its own way as well. It's kind of modernized.
It's not just a pastiche. So it has a slightly different kind of like aiming with the second stick combat system. The puzzles are sort of in line with what those games did originally as well, like collecting different keys and following, like reading documents, following clues and writing codes down, things like that.
But I would say that compared to, you know, picking up something like the original Resident Evil 2 now, it's a very palatable, cool indie spin on this kind of game. What do you think of it, Matthew?
Yeah, I'd agree with all that. Comes from a place of love for those games, but also an eye for modern accessibility or just, you know, the smoothing of those rough edges. I find it quite frictionless, not as a criticism.
You know, I enjoy exploring that theme park and making quite quick progress through that theme park. None of the puzzles were, like, super difficult. I don't find it particularly, like, scary in any way.
I don't know if it's just, like, too cute and dinky, like that little isometric view. There's a little bit of, like, eerie sound design in it and some sort of vague meaty horrors, but... Yeah, this has been a good episode for, like, meats.
Bad meats. And actually, there are these kind of tall, long-leg things which wouldn't be out of place too much in Still Wakes the Deep. Thinking about it.
I think I like it as much as part of, like, the ongoing project of SFB Games, who are the people who made it, in that, you know, primarily these two brothers, Tom and Adam, and they made the Detective Grimoire, Detective Games, which are very handsomely done, a lot of fun. They also did Snipperclips, the launch game on Switch. They've made interesting kind of puzzle games between.
They're a very, like, productive studio, you know. They make something every kind of every kind of couple of years, you know, if not quicker than that. You know, they're making the next Detective Grimoire alongside Crow Country, and they've sort of set an interesting kind of pace for themselves.
And I just like their productivity. I like that they have an idea, they kind of execute something quite quickly, make it happen, do it to a, you know, a high level, decent level. People like it, and then they move on.
So it almost reminds me a little bit of, like, Simogo in that way. They're not a, oh, this indie studio has made two games, you have to wait seven years for the next one. They're just like game makers.
And some of those things are going to land more for you than others. But like the variety of things they've made, I find really interesting. Yeah, I just like them.
I think they're cool.
Yeah, I didn't know they made Tangle Tower. I had no idea. Because you talked up that game before, right?
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, there's just a lot of different strings there, Beau. And if you put all their games alongside each other, I think it'd be quite hard to identify them, like the through line between them, you know, other than, you know, the kind of, you know, the polish and maybe some of the visual quirks, because they've got the same sort of art brain behind them.
But yeah, like interesting sort of British homegrown odd success story, particularly the slip eclipse bit of it all. I've always been fascinated by that, like to have a Nintendo first party thing when you're two guys in the UK is odd.
Yeah, I guess it is.
You know, that's almost like, it's not quite the same thing, but it's, you know, it has a little bit of like the old days of, you know, Argonaut and Star Fox and all that. It's just outsiders who have a little, a little kind of one foot inside the strange first party machine. So, yeah, I like that.
And this game is a fine continuation of their very good work today.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's, I don't think it's that long either. I've only seen you near the end, Matthew, but...
Yeah, I think it's only meant to be like four or five hours long.
Perfect. It's exactly what I want to hear these days. So, yes, that's everything I'm playing is basically five hours or less until, I don't know, until I dive back into FF7.
Until fucking metaphor-y fantasy.
Dragon Age and, yeah, what other nightmares await at the end of the year to consume my time. I have curiosity, Matthew, because I know we both enjoyed Crow Country, so I don't have loads more to add to that. I think you've kind of summed it up quite nicely there.
Actually, one thing I will say, actually, is that you write that the dinky, sort of like almost diorama-like level designs mean that it maybe does take a tiny bit of the edge off of things. I do wonder if they had slightly more humanoid-looking characters, because the characters are almost Playmobil-ish kind of style to them.
Yeah.
A bit different to, you know, sort of like, you know, I would personally say that the designs of Claire Redfield, you know, and like Jill Valentine or like, you know, Aya from Parasite Eve, those characters are all, like, quite brilliant. Like, they're very, very visually distinctive from the PS1, that they really did a good job of making them seem sort of like, you know, they have, like, they seem fairly iconic when you reflect on them. And this is, I think, like, I do wonder if this had slightly more of that aesthetic, whether it would be a tiny bit scarier, or maybe a little bit closer to its inspiration than it is, but maybe that distance is not a bad thing.
It certainly, yeah, but on its own terms, I think it absolutely succeeds. So, yeah, enjoying it. OK, Matthew, yeah, so the thing I was going to ask about was, did you keep playing Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance?
Because I know you started this. We talked a bit about it behind the scenes, but I wondered if you persisted with it at all.
I haven't made a huge dent on it, which is why I haven't added it to the document. It's, I mean, I didn't make, like, a huge dent on it on the Switch, and then I've started it again, you know, this Vengeance version, and was sort of instantly reminded why. Like, it's quite stern from the off.
Right.
You know, a game where you can comfortably die, not necessarily like the tutorial fight, but like the first natural fight you meet in the game. If things just go a little bit wrong for you, it's like game over. Quite hard to get a foothold in.
You know, the whole thing in Shin Megami Tensei is obviously recruiting monsters. They sort of form your kind of party. They're with you on the adventure.
And they seem very sort of squishy, I believe the term is, early on. So no sooner have I recruited monsters, they're kind of getting off at quite a rate. And actually just getting anyone who is sort of can survive just long enough means that the kind of early stretch of party building and kind of squad building is is quite challenging.
That's kind of what people want from this. It's always been the meaner, older brother of Persona. That continues.
I know that if you can munch through that, it kind of creates this amazing buy in to what's going on. And, you know, I really enjoyed when they did the Shin Megami Tensei 3 HD version a couple of years ago. It's just kind of quite mean and cold to the touch.
And so any kind of progress you did made felt quite kind of hard, hard won. And I guess it's like what people like about you. Yeah.
Yeah. Souls likes in a way, but I haven't quite ever made enough progress in this one to kind of get to that point yet. So I'm hoping it happens for me in Vengeance.
So then it did on Switch.
Yeah, I've sort of always I always think I've got like the stomach for these games and then I play them and they just kick my ass so relentlessly. And I'm sort of like the vibes of them that I do get. I very much enjoy, but then I feel very much sort of like, yeah, ground down by them.
And I'm like, oh, maybe I am just a soft persona boy. And that's where I sort of belong. And that's my it's okay that that's my realm, you know, that I'm the good hangs guy.
But they are they do they have a dark heart these games. And I kind of like that about them.
You know, they're so much stranger from the off than persona. Ancient gods kind of croaking apocalyptic things at you. And it's definitely a vibe.
I'm also constantly aware that there's big decisions that you're making along the way can like drastically shape the outcome. And I'm just very aware that even a very hard fought victory could end horribly in these games, just because they're you know, they've all got quite bleak endings. And you have to, you know, you basically feels that you have to have a walkthrough telling you what the right decisions are, or you're not going to get the good ending.
And that's not how I want to play the game. But then I've just got it in the back of my head of like, I'm definitely fucking this up in some way. It's just quite a lot.
It's not very relaxing. I tried playing on, because I had last Friday off and I was on Thursday and Catherine was just like writing endless Elder Ring guides because unfortunately, that's like the circle of hell she now lives on for the rest of her life. Unfortunate that.
So I thought, oh, I thought I'll relax at some Shin Megami Tensei V, said no one ever. And yeah, lo and behold, after about an hour and a half, I was like, this is such a terrible way to spend an evening. I'm in a really foul mood.
So I stopped playing it and then had like three terrible rounds of Bellatro. So I was in just an awful mood when I went to bed because I felt like the gods had killed all my monster friends. And then I'd just been dealt like asshole deck after asshole deck by Bellatro.
So yeah, it's a time of great frustration. After that, Paper Mario was just like, you know, heavenly for all I moan about it. Like it was definitely much kinder to me and probably much better for my mental health than everything else I've got going on.
Well, now we see how all the pieces fit. It's a rich tapestry, the life of Matthew Castle and the games they're in.
That's me being like, Paper Mario is not hardcore enough. And then the second I actually play an RPG with teeth, Shin Megami Tensei, and then it's like, I'm just too much of a wuss for that. That's why I need metaphor really fantastic.
It's probably going to sit in the middle like personas. Yeah, exactly.
That's exactly what it's going to do. I would say can't come soon enough, but I'm actually enjoying just having the time to clear my backlog a little bit.
Yeah, I mean, there wouldn't be any Mullet Madjack.
Well, yeah, I've actually, this is probably the year I've made the most effort to keep on top of Indies and trying to at least play everything that comes out on Game Pass and at least buy two games a month on Steam that I haven't heard of or have only recently sort of emerged. You know, I've made like probably more of an effort this year than I have with any recent year because it's just been, there's been so many of them. But the thing I try and keep in mind is no one's played all of these games.
Like no one's played, you know, like Crow Country, Bellatro and like 1000X Resist. And then like there's like three to four, Botany Manor. There's like three to four others that will come out at the same time.
And no one's got time for every single one of them. Maybe you do, Matthew, I don't know.
I've started playing, what the hell is it called? I'm just going to find the symbol on my desktop. That no case should remain unsolved.
Oh, right.
Which is like... I don't know how to describe it. Like, maybe like a little bit Sam Barlow-esque in that you're kind of clicking through testimony of people involved in a crime, like a missing child case.
And you kind of click on words. And then that takes you to kind of related bits of testimony. But then there's a kind of key mechanic is matching who the testimony actually belongs to.
Like, it's unmarked, so you don't know. You know, you've got like, you know, five or six different speakers and then you kind of slot it in. And then you have to, you're trying to kind of work out from clues in the text, you know, who said this?
Who is most likely to have said this? And then also place it in the timeline of their testimony. So by the end of the game, you'll have everything in chronological order.
And I'm assuming the case will make sense. That's quite interesting.
Yeah, that's a game that sort of like has gradually built up an audience on Steam because it's not very expensive. But then Edge reviewed it quite recently and gave it a high score, is that right?
Yeah, that's exactly why I got it, yeah.
That's it. We are all, on this podcast, we're very dependent on Edge Magazine to uncover indie gems for us. So it's a vital resource for sure.
Their new cover is really nice, actually, the blue one. I can't remember what the game's called, but the, is it Kamuri? Something like that?
Do you know the cover I mean?
Yeah, isn't it, what's the chops from?
Nakamura.
It used to be a Tango.
Is that a name? Nakamura? Kumi Nakamura?
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so I've got that to read and perhaps I will be educated like you were on this game. It's got a nice art style for sure.
Yeah, for about six quid, can't really complain. Yeah, so lots to play this year, lots to enjoy. By the end of the year, I think it's going to be a really interesting, I think we'll end up having a split of like five blockbusters apiece, five indie games apiece.
I can see it landing that way in the end of year list. Just the profile of the year feels like it's a kind of like pretty even split between them as opposed to last year, which was felt very blockbuster dominated. This is like a little bit more, a tiny bit more manageable, but still plenty of good stuff.
OK, Matthew, well, that's the end of the What We've Been Playing episode. Next week is the Back Page: election. Whoever wins, you lose.
And yes, that is a thing that you can look forward to, slash dread. We'll make sure we won't do that on Monday night, so we're both in a bit more of a jolly mood. I think that would be quite important for an episode that's supposed to be funny.
We'll see how it goes. And yeah, we have lots of treats coming up in July on patreon.com/backpagepod. We've got the limited run games draft, where we basically come up with fake versions of limited run and bundle in silly items with ten different games.
That will be daft, high chance of chaos. So a lot of voter-based nonsense happening at the start of July. So yeah.
And then at the end of July, we'll have the first part of our Grand Nintendo List Making Project. So look forward to that. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
