Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast.
Matthew, welcome back to the podcast. Doing a Games Court on a Monday night, what a fucking tough proposition that is. Are you feeling jolly on a Monday night in the UK when the pound has crashed to a low against the dollar?
And on top of that, my office, which I'm recording in, stinks of garlic because I had to eat a garlicky pizza here because I'm avoiding Catherine because she's got COVID. So we're in the quarantine zone. So I'm stuck in this really garlic ass room.
Yeah, that's tough.
And I'll be buying fewer pizzas because my money's now worthless.
More time there was dedicated to the pizzas and the garlic than Catherine getting COVID. I'm not judging. I'm just objectively, I feel that's how it shook out.
Yeah.
Well, I think, listen, after two years of this, everyone knows what the deal is with COVID. People might not know how garlicky my pizza is, you know?
That's true. This is new information, whereas that is not.
I'm prioritizing the fresh takes.
Yeah, that is fair. Okay, so Matthew, you know how I always like to tell people what we're doing at the start of each month on the Patreon and stuff, so people know what they're getting for their money? I thought I'd do that again before we get into this week's nonsense.
And believe me, it is nonsense. So look forward to that. So Matthew, first up on the 7th of October, our first episode of the month, we've got an episode with Ben Hanson of MinMax, formerly of Game Informer, kind of like in the style of our usual sort of mag interview episodes.
We just recorded that one this past Friday. Ben actually reached out to us to record, which is really nice. And so I thought the episode turned out great because Ben's way more charismatic than us.
Is that how you felt about that one?
Yeah, he's way more professional on the mic. Also, because he was on Game Informer, probably saw more of the games industry in any given month than I maybe did in my entire career. So it's sort of a bit of an embarrassment of Rich's in terms of studio visits and such.
Not that I'm jealous. He was a very lovely chap to talk to.
Yeah, I like, every time we add a new Kojima anecdote to this podcast, I feel like that Thanos gif where he sticks another stone in the glove and then makes a big purple orgasm face. That's kind of like my sort of response. I'm like, yeah, Kojima anecdotes.
That's what we exist for, to tell those.
Do we kill half the patrons at the end?
No, because I want their money too much, so it's got to hit that stretch goal, you know? So, next up, the first Patreon episode of the month, the XL episode for people at the XL tier, is, it's Zelda rated, isn't it Matthew? Have we entirely settled on what this is yet?
We originally said best Zelda dungeons, but it might be something else.
It'll be a Zelda-y, listy feature of some kind.
So, anyone who enjoyed the seminal best Zelda games episode of this podcast, I would say it's one of the very best that we've done, all carried by Matthew, of course. I just cracked wise in the background.
I'm quite tempted to do it a bit like the Metal Gear one, just classic moments, you know?
Oh, I was hoping you'd do that, because that would just be, I think our listeners would really dig that, so that'd be cool. So, yep, something great coming the Patreon subscribers way this month. Next up is episode 100 of the podcast, which is called Clip Show.
That's on the 14th of October. 21st of October is Best Visual Novels with Lucy Blundell. I hope I'm pronouncing your name right there, Lucy, but Lucy's a long-time listener and a game developer, made One Night Stand.
Gonna come on and talk about visual novels and her new game, which is very exciting. Want to have Lucy on for a while. So that's cool.
I'm sure Matthew, you've got things to say on, to discuss with Lucy on that front, being a big visual novel head yourself.
Well, yeah, I dabble.
Lucy seems like a true authority. So I think, yeah, that'd be, if you've enjoyed any of our recent episodes about, you know, like the adventure, LucasArts Adventure Games one, we like to get someone on who knows what they're talking about, even when we're not necessarily, do we don't necessarily know as much, that should be good. For the XXL episode this month, so that's the Patreon pop culture episode, horror movies we actually like.
I imagine that'd be a similar format to best thriller movies, Matthew, the one we did just 20 recommendations in a row. You looking forward to that one?
Yeah, I'm scared though.
Yeah, Matthew's a notorious coward. So yeah, couldn't be bothered to do another Halloween episode this year. So on the 28th of October, we've got Bayonetta 3 in the Platinum Games Hall of Fame.
So if you enjoyed the Hall of Fame format, debuted in our LucasArts Adventure Games episode and stolen from The Big Picture Podcast, our favorite film podcast.
What wasn't?
Yeah, exactly. Look forward to that. It should be good.
We're hoping, fingers crossed, John Wrangle, Rich Sandon, onto that one. We know that will supercharge the episode. So fingers crossed we can convince him to come on in time.
We've got a whole month, Matthew. Good luck to us. Fingers crossed.
Your mission if you choose to accept it.
Exactly. So that's what's coming up this month. patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like to support us.
From the 1st of October, I'm actually changing, Patreon's just added a new way you can bill people, which is if you sign up at any point in the month, you don't get billed again until that same date, the next month. So previously, what would happen is people would subscribe on the 20th and then they'd get billed again on the 1st, which was not ideal because they were paying very close together to access the Excel tier content. We want to make that simpler.
Patreon has literally just rolled out this feature, so I'm going to change it. So if you sign up at any point, you won't be billed for a whole month. After you sign up, and then you'll be billed that way from here on in.
So that seems fairer, doesn't it Matthew? Do you agree that's the right approach, the right way to treat our listeners?
Yeah, I think so, you know. There's quite a lot of talk about billing systems quite early on in the episode.
Not very exciting, isn't it? I just want to tell the listeners that we're being fair to them. That's all Matthew.
Okay, enough of that then. Oh, Jesus Christ. Monday night Games Court, so yes, we're back in our, you know, most beloved and most hated format of podcast.
Excited to be here? Question mark should be good. So welcome to the third Games Court episode of 2022.
We recently hosted a trial for GTA clones, but that accidentally ended up being a really meaningful episode with Jeremy Peel. So here we are with some total horseshit to balance the scales. We're back to put listeners on trial for their pre-owned game purchases.
Did you ever blow a fat snack on a JRPG you don't even have the hardware to play? Or perhaps you bought a 3 out of 10 monstrosity for pocket change. It's time to name your sin and try your luck in the Back Page Games Court.
I, Judge Big Sammy, am presiding. May God have mercy on your souls. So Matthew, Games Court...
I wrote that intro and it didn't sound right. I am not able to nail your voice at all.
It's tough because I improvise massive parts of this podcast. And so it's actually quite odd when I'm reading to a script. I thought I sounded pretty good then, but maybe not.
I don't know.
Did you hit a blow of fat stack on a JLPG?
Fat stack doesn't sound very me, does it? Yeah, it sounds like something you would say more, I think. But fat stack, I enjoyed it nonetheless.
It was good. I do enjoy it when Matthew plans out an episode because I feel like you feel under a lot of pressure to like do it well. And I don't know why, because I always make these things about 45 minutes at the most, sometimes in 10 minutes, Matthew.
So, you're feeling good about Games Court and doing this again?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
A bit too slow on the answer there, I think, to be convincing.
Yeah, I mean, I've been pretty ruthless with what has and hasn't made the cut. I feel like people who do like Games Court try and kind of game us a little bit with their entries. And either, you know, they write these sort of really long, goofy anecdotes that they think we'll like or...
Think we'll like!
And that's fine. I do like that stuff, but I do feel like sometimes people are quite cynically targeting us, where I think the magic comes from the unexpected posts often. I'd also say like, maybe this is just an offshoot of this podcast having, you know, a positive impact on people's buying decisions.
That a lot of people seem to be buying the same games, which is fine. That's fine. But it means we cover, like this episode, I think there's like, there's one game, which is in like five different entries, for example, and...
Is it Hotel Dust?
Yeah.
That's great. But like, I've also, I think we've sort of shared all our takes on some of these games. But we've got some things we've never talked about before.
We've got a really baffling anecdote as well, which made me laugh. So that's good.
I was like thinking about this. My dream games court entry at this point is someone saying, oh, hey, guys, my name is Gerard Manley. I just started listening to the podcast two weeks ago, and I just bought a PC engine for 850 pounds.
What do you think? Like that's my dream games court entry. Because there's no pandering.
And there's like a genuinely interesting thing that's been purchased.
So that would be the complete package of Games Court entry.
That's your ideal listener's name.
Well, only for the Games Court format. Obviously, I love our listeners, but it is true that there is a certain vocabulary of games we've established on this podcast, where you do hear the same games come up again and again from the listeners, because they're obviously, you know, they're engaging with what we like, and that's really nice, but it does mean that the Games Court entries, I have to be a bit harsher, because if you're pandering, then, you know, I don't like that. Judge Big Sammy doesn't like that.
Samuel Roberts loves that. Judge Big Sammy, technically a different entity in this whole affair, like, livid. So, yeah, we'll see how it goes, but I'm going to try and...
I originally wanted to do this hungover, this episode, but because it's a Monday night, I can't. So I am just having a tall glass of red wine. Red wine that I bought from the wine hut near our flat, near where we live, Matthew.
That makes it sound, like, less classy than it is.
It is a pretty classy joint. He's got two huts now, hasn't he?
They sell nice wines there. That's where Katherine gets all her wines.
Those are, like, genuinely good wines as well. I've started to learn there are no good wines at Sainsbury's. M&S has good wines, but the hut...
There's a man with long hair. He seems very convincing about wines, so I trust him. And he gave me a 12-pound something or other.
He talked about it for a while. I wasn't really listening, but then I just gave him my money, and then I left, and here I am now.
Did you go to him and say, I need a bottle of wine that's going to get me through Games Court, and then spend 10 minutes explaining what Games Court is?
Yeah, he was like, Mate, how long have you got? Because, you know, you're going to need a lot. You need a fancy-ass bottle of wine to get through this, to sustain the psychological damage from a Games Court episode.
So I know some of the listeners don't love this format. I think a couple of people have said, is it OK that I don't like Games Court? And, you know, of course, that's completely fine.
And they're probably not even listening right now. Assholes, that's a joke. But I suppose what I will say is, I will try my best to shed some light on the games being discussed, or offer some opinion that's got some value, so it's not just like a total clown show.
We'll see how that goes, though. So Matthew, you wrote the plan here. What's the first question you want to ask me?
I've got some questions for you. So I want to know how goes life on Samuel Roberts Peninsula. If that's where we live, I've forgotten some of the lore.
We've just had a period of national mourning here in the UK. Have there been any big national funerals on your watch?
So this is, you know, Samuel Roberts Peninsula, you know, we weren't part of the British Empire. We don't subscribe to any of that monarchy stuff. It's just about kind of like a mad dictator and his travelling band of weirdos.
So basically listeners may remember that we had annexed part of Indonesia in a previous episode. We were like chased out at the end. So what we've been doing is we've relocated to a floating barge of garbage in the middle of the Indian Ocean, which we refer to as Aldi Mother Base.
And basically what that means is that everyone is, it's kind of like a floating nation. Things have been looking a bit bleak economically, right? But we actually just like plunged our entire gross domestic product into shorting the pound and it's paid off big time.
So while we are on a floating barge of garbage now, we've got enough money to clear our damages to the Indonesian government and maybe secure some land so we can be an actual peninsula again. So that's just right, you know, mortality rate pretty high, I'll be honest, but you know, what can you do? That's life on a sail barge, you know?
How does the court system work out in international waters?
Well, we just sort of make it up. There's a lot of human rights kind of like organizations hovering around, like they pull up in these little boats and then we blow them up with cannons like in Sea of Thieves. We're just like, oh yeah, UNICEF's here.
And I'm like, oh yeah, can you man the cannons? We've got to fucking sink these guys. But that's like our whole situation really.
It's like controversial, but it keeps the people down. And that's what I'm all about, man. I just want to keep the people down.
I'm picturing Dennis Hopper's big oil tanker from Waterworld.
Yeah, that's a really good way of putting it. I wish I'd watched Waterworld again and had more of a reference going into this. But yeah, that's, you know, Dennis Hopper vibes, definitely.
That's very much me, like, really unpredictable. Like, you know, 90s Dennis Hopper where you're like, is this guy definitely okay?
That's good. That's the energy you want from a judge.
Yep, yep, absolutely. So yeah, that's, you know, that's Samuel Roberts' peninsula. Floating Aldi Mother Base.
Lovely, I love that phrase. So traditionally our courtroom is swarming with famous faces. Do we have any video game characters in the courtroom today?
Yep, so we've got a mean bean from Dr. Robotnik's mean bean.
It's like two green ones together, stuck together.
How many more mean beans do you need for the mean beans to erase themselves?
Two. We've only got two. So that's like part of the quest for this country is to find more mean beans so we can make them disappear.
But as it stands, we just, you know, we're just travelling around with two mean beans. It's tough, you know. So Matthew, mean bean machine or Tetris, which is better?
Go.
Tetris.
So do you want to know who else is here?
Yeah, of course. I hope it's not just two mean beans.
We're just getting started. So we've got Captain Toad and the only treasure he's tracked so far is Johnny Sasaki's barrel, which unfortunately makes a return appearance. It's tough when your whole career is built on uncovering treasure and you're on a floating sail barge of garbage.
So he's very distressed, Captain Toad.
Be careful where you stick your pickaxe in this environment.
Exactly. And I would say a lot of the lads down in the kitchen are eyeing him up for mushroom stew as well, so they might try and cook him at some point. I mean, I don't want that to happen.
That might be why UNICEF are here to try and stop that from happening, but as mentioned, we sank them.
To quote the great man himself, Oh no!
I do love Captain Toad. What a cute little man he is, just doing his best. You get the impression he's only partially competent at what he does, but god damn it, he will turn up and he'll go for it.
And I just really respect that. So yeah, here he is on the floating sail barge. So Johnny Sasaki himself has actually been executed for war crimes, and that happened since the last one.
Well, maybe good.
What happened is one night we all had a playmate or guest on it for a night, and we played it and we were like, yes, he did commit war crimes, so we executed him. That's tough. We used his own game against him, which is difficult.
Do you want to know who else is here?
Yeah, of course I do.
Okay, that large lad merchant from Resneyville Village is here. So he's only here because he actually came to the original Samuel Roberts Peninsula on a kind of like fitness first holiday to try and get in shape. But obviously like a lot's happened since then.
So he is losing weight, but only through starvation, which is tough. So it's like he's not having the best time, but you know, he's still he's trying to stay upbeat. He's got like a DLC coming out.
He's you know, he's trying to just stay a bit jolly. So we got him.
The thing is, if he loses all his weight, the internet's going to have to delete so many hand wringing op-eds about fat shaming in Capcom.
Oh, did that happen? Was that a thing that happened?
I read one which was like, if you see yourself in that incredibly strange man, I mean, that's more on you, I think.
Yeah, I don't think he's being shamed as such.
He's a very successful businessman. He has one of the more enviable lives in that game.
Yeah, I'd love to know how the economy actually works in that village. Who's buying stuff from him on the reg? Like if it's not Ethan Winters, what does a working day look like for him?
That's my question to you. What do you reckon?
Oh, it's Monday night. I can't possibly answer my question like that.
I will say we're regularly giving his bellybutton a hose down, though. We've got that service going. I don't want Captain Toad going anywhere near that bellybutton.
Put me bean in there.
We've only got two, but yeah. So there's that going on. Nuclear Gandhi returns, but he has evolved into Intergalactic Warlord Gandhi.
And he has just declared war on Jupiter. So that's tough. Yeah, he just can't really predict that guy.
We've got Cole Phelps from LA. Noire. We want someone who's just going to go...
Basically, he's going to go down on every single entry here and just completely lose his shit. And we just think that's a nice bit of drama there. And we've got Jeremy Peel here.
He's going to write a feature about it for Polygon or something. That's good about Samuel Roberts' Peninsula. So I wish him well.
That should be good.
All your favorites are here. The Mean Beans, Captain Toad, Jeremy.
Yeah, that's it.
Can I just ask, is Jeremy Peel, is he rendered in the same way as Cole Phelps? An amazing photorealistic face but quite a crude body.
No, he's been rendered in the same fashion as PS1 Hagrid. It's a very cursed version of Jeremy Peel.
A slightly vibrating polygon.
Low poly Jeremy Peel. It's tough break. God knows what to think listening to this podcast back again.
And then finally we've got Waluigi here as well, who's here on some kind of unknown diplomatic mission. But I'm not really clear on the details. I requested Wario and got Waluigi, which I feel like is an indictment of the cultural status of this island.
Yeah, that's not ideal. Waluigi, who whenever I hear his name, I always think of the worst football chant of all time from Mario Strikers, which is wa-wa-Waluigi, which is just no one put any effort into that.
I mean, to be fair though, what rhymes with Waluigi? Just Luigi, right? So where would you start with that?
Like, if you're given like two years and $10 million, do you think you'd come up with a better one?
Yeah, I just wouldn't put Waluigi at the end of the line. It's like, Waluigi's on the pitch, and then the next line writes itself, I would imagine.
He's cracked it, ladies and gentlemen.
That's how you write. That's how football people write it.
Yeah, exactly. So next question, Matthew. We've established he's in the courtroom, a tenuous bunch of low lives and toads investigating shit barrels.
So yeah, what's next?
So this edition of Games Court is pretty stacked. You'll be glad to hear it is mostly games and prices. I've trimmed out some of the bullshit anecdotes.
Also people who submitted things that weren't pre-owned games. I'm just not reading them out, I'm sorry. So I know that's how you like it.
We've got a couple of sub stories, of course. I was just wondering if there's any particular dangerous territory I should be steering my clients away from, any particular areas of the pre-owned market that really get your goat.
Sub stories, you know, they get on my nerves slightly. Where it's like, my second cousin died ten years ago and now I've bought cameo elements of power for like 18 quid. I'm not interested, do you know what I mean?
Those things don't hang together, you know? That's tough. We did cover last time, landlording video games.
I'm not into that. That guy was hoarding all those Silent Hill games he wasn't going to play. You've got to at least pretend you're going to play the thing that you bought.
If you haven't, that's an instant death. It's decorative, not good.
But he was planning specifically to sell them. He was speculating to accumulate.
Exactly. That's what landlords do, Matthew. That's why no one's got a fucking house in the UK because someone's boomer aunt has 18 flats in Wrexham.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
So yeah, that's dangerous territory. And also, I think I mentioned this last time, but like, Baity entries are like, oh, I just bought Star Fox Assault for £3. Is this a good purchase?
And I'm like, well, of course it is. That game's like £60 on eBay. The game itself may be dubious in the case of Star Fox Assault, but £3 is a great price.
Well, that sounds like a good entry. Just what you said then was interesting.
Well, no, I mean, I made it up, but you know. But like, there's no peril.
Honest to Sam, compared to some of the entries, I wish we had something as interesting as Star Fox Assault for £3. This would be a banger if they were all like that.
Is this where we should reveal that before we started recording, you said, we've got some dire entries this week. That was pretty amazing as like a kick-off point. That's good.
The listeners are used to us taking shots at this point, Matthew. It's what we do. So, you've got one more question for me, right?
Yeah. So, this is the really important one. This is why we're all here, I think.
If the defendants' pre-owned games choices are found wanting, how will they be punished?
You remember Lady Boyle's last party in Dishonored?
Yes, I do.
Yeah. So, you remember that like you could murder... You had to figure out which of the sisters was Lady Boyle, and then you had to like take her out accordingly.
That was like the mission. Do you remember there was an alternative way to finish this where you would incapacitate Lady Boyle and she'd be taken away by Lord Brisby, an obvious pervert. Do you remember that?
Yes.
Okay, so all the listeners who are sentenced to death here will be incapacitated and taken away by the pervert Lord Brisby. And what happens to them is none of my business, but that's what's going to happen, okay?
That is incredibly bleak. That was bleak in the game and that's even more bleak here.
Do you know, like 15 minutes before we started recording this, I googled Ladyboil Pervert to try and figure out who this was. That was like my shortcut to try and get that information. What did you refer to him as?
A clear pervert? A known pervert?
A clear pervert? What does that mean?
He's clearly a pervert.
Well, yeah, definitely. That's like the whole thing, isn't it? Also, like, Lord Brisby has appeared.
I love it. Yeah, that's it. So, there you go, listeners.
Hope you... Because what happens to you afterwards, you may live, you may die, I'll never find out. No one will.
That's like you just get put on a little wooden boat and pushed away with Lord Brisby. Good luck to you. So, let's...
Matthew, I believe you've prepared an opening statement for the court. Do you want to crack on with it?
Yeah, I have. So, just before we start, I'd like to address some malicious rumours that I've heard doing the rounds. Before I was a lawyer, I was a small-time con man known as Tumbling Matty.
Apparently, I've heard that I would fake a tumble in Pret a Monge to get a free chicken and bacon baguette. And I only gave this up because I wore away my teeth on the rock hard artisanal bread at Pret a Monge. It is not true.
And whoever's spreading that rumour, I'd like them to stop.
He also drove his brother mad till he killed himself in a house fire.
Oh yeah, I did that. That did happen. But anyway, to today's business.
If you believe in days, which I obviously don't, coming from the time-free hell world of Matthew Castle Island. My clients stand in this courtroom accused of wasting their personal funds and doing so at a time where our currency is being driven into the dirt by total clowns. Remember when we used to get two dollars to the pound?
Some of the accused today might have gotten away with their crimes at that conversion rate. But today they are just another body on the ever-growing Tory funeral pyre. Even Samuel Roberts Island is better than this country.
And that place, let me remind you, was a literal black hole full of weird Konami IP.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
Anyway, let us not drown in the woes of the real world headlines. And let us drown instead in a sturdy glass tank filled with 400 gallons of water and closely observed by a clearly disturbed Michael Caine. And let the hand on the dunking lever be that of Judge Samuel Roberts.
A man who purports to be an arbiter of taste, while also quietly rating the tragic character arcs of Revenge of the Sith. Yes, he's our very own Emperor Palpatine, here to wrestle clumsily with the Office Chair of Justice.
Trust me, if you're a Patreon supporter, you're loving this bit. And if you're not, well, I hope you spent that £4.50 on something worthwhile, and not, say, a pre-owned copy of Dark Sector. The only thing that would be tumbling in that respect is my respect for you.
I rest my case.
Very good. So, yes, I do like the idea that we have these basically DLC unlockable jokes, the main episodes now, if you've actually listened to the Patreon episodes. So, that's very good.
Yeah, as mentioned, we've shorted the pound on here. So, yeah, we got all our advice from some bloke with an eye patch who was in a meeting with Liz Trust last week, and it worked out great, I'll be honest.
Yeah, so, you know, Michael Caine, he's around, you know. We've kind of gone for the Muppets Christmas Carol version this time though. So, he'll just basically, as soon as someone is going to die, he'll see their name on a gravestone and then just sort of pull his Michael Caine face.
Just attached to the tanks, I realise that they're getting... Your actual trip to Lord Brisby's Pervert Domain is not too bad. It's quite a nice canal boat.
So, that bit's fun.
That bit's fun. What happens afterwards, though? I mean, again, we can only elude.
We can only elude.
Yeah.
Yeah, but that's the thing. I mean, definitely, like, if there's one thing that Judge Big Sammy and Sam Roberts Peninsula struggle with, it's trying to, like, get out from under the shadow of the pulping and the Michael Caine tanks. These are, like, iconic Judge...
Matthew Castle sort of, like, ways of killing people. And we've yet to top it, so we can try.
I think being whisked away to some Deviants realm is pretty good.
That's true, but it doesn't have the sort of obvious, like, you know, we've got ourselves a pulping. I mean, you can't underestimate just how much pulping has become, like, a key phrase in the Discord, Matthew. That's, like, a whole other language.
Yeah, it's big in the old word cloud, that's for sure.
Right, let's get to the exhibit, shall we? Because we've got fucking loads of them, or at least a few that are really long. So do you want to kick off?
Yes. So exhibit A, this is from Adam. This year I had the urge to play Ocarina of Time again, and to be honest, the Switch Online version just wasn't cutting it.
So Adam got a 3DS with Ocarina of Time in Majora's Mask, which has triggered some 3DS and DS collecting. So here's what he went with. We got a good list of games and prices.
Hotel Dusk, £4.25.
Very good.
Mario 3D Land, £8.
Very good. Excellent game.
Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, £10.
Pretty good.
All four of the DS Professor Layton games, for £22.
I don't think they have much value, but that's not egregious.
What? Monetary value or creative value?
Oh, I just mean monetary value. It's one versus the other. That's not a bad price for a pile of four games, but they are pretty cheap in terms of like, you know, they were bought by so many dads in the UK like over ten years ago, you know?
Yeah, okay. And finally, because I'm a parody of myself, he writes, Persona Q for £42.
Now, okay, so I think there's some careful judgement going on there. Like, there's no wild swings in terms of like, this game's an obvious pile of shit. So this is the Adam guy who's got the Persona 5 avatar in the Discord, right?
Oh, that's right, yeah.
He seems like a good dude. Would hate to have to send him off to a pervert for unknown reasons, for unknown means.
I like that your avatar image is basically like a kind of character witness statement in this courtroom. You know, like, you've seen sound from his picture.
Yeah, it's like when US airport security people look you up on Twitter. It's that kind of thing. I'm using your own publicly available information against you.
Persona Q is the big question there, then. Now, I do know that that game is exactly the profile of a game that would be worth £42. But I'm pretty sure you could buy it digitally for about £10.
But then, there is always the question of, Nintendo will shut this down at some point, and then who knows what happens to your digital version down the line, you know?
It's like... I should be defending it. Yeah, I think it's great.
Good price for a good game.
Good. Yeah, so, it's not like... I don't think it would be anyone's preferred Persona.
I think like dungeon crawlery games, these games?
Yeah, so it's basically an Etrian Odyssey spin-off for Persona, which is pretty much pure dungeon crawling. It's got quite a fun mechanic, as does Etrian Odyssey, where you draw the maps on the touch screen. That's how it uses the second screen.
But it's... If you're being ungenerous, you could maybe describe it as a game made up of your least favourite bit of Persona, and only that, which is the dungeon crawling in quite a nondescript dungeon. It's not the fun dungeons of Persona 5.
It's like Persona 4, just random corridor type deal.
But I do believe you get to see different Persona characters interacting in the story bits, right?
Yeah, it's the gang from 3 and the gang from 4 together.
That's pretty cool. But let's see if there's a second one. I believe that's got the gang from 5 in it as well, right?
I haven't played the second one, but... Yeah, that's got Joker and company in it. So that seems more appealing to me.
But am I going to hold that against them? You're a Persona completist. That's expensive business.
I'm going to allow it, Matthew. This is innocent. Adam will not be going off to Lord Brisby's Pervert Domain.
Amazing.
One clear. We're good. Good start.
There is celebration from the court.
Yeah, just a little kind of woohoo from Toad inside the ship barrel.
Waluigi is trying to start a chant of wah, wah, Waluigi, but no one's having any of it. Next up, Exhibit B from Dan. Hi, Matthew and Samuel.
See, some of these, I should say in advance, I've tweaked some of these emails to be abbreviations and I've written them as what I can say to abbreviate them. I can't do it on the fly. So Exhibit B from Dan.
He loves the podcast. He used to buy on them around the GameCube era and he has fond memories of saving up pocket money for it. Here's some stuff he bought on eBay.
I've really butchered that email from him. Sorry, Dan. Oh, this is a juicy one to start off with.
God Hand for £63.35.
The Ultimate puts Samuel Roberts to the test. Games Court entry that. God, I love God Hand.
I'm going to need a minute to process it, so let's go through the rest.
Silent Hill 2 for £27.08.
That sounds about right for where Silent Hill prices are at because, you know, Konami refuses to let you play them in any form, but they're terrible Xbox 360 form, so I get it.
Apparently it had a charity shop price label on it for £1.75, so someone had bought this for £1.75 from a charity shop and then sold it on to a pre-owned. I imagine they made a profit on it.
Yeah, just imagine me doing sort of like Colonel Campbell voice when I go, the CEX economy, you know, that's like what's happened there.
Kirby Super Star Ultra on DS for £60.
This is a Matthew Castle bullshit. So what's the price again, sorry?
£60.
£60?
This one is hard to come by.
I think I'm gonna have to maybe kill him based on that. You know, we did a Kirby episode, right? But I don't think any Kirby game is worth £60.
Like if you bought the entire lot for £60, I'd be like, yes, very good. But Jesus Christ, I mean, can you be that desperate to play Kirby? I mean, they just brought out one of the best Kirby games this year, Matthew.
Keep going.
Yeah, yeah. So the next couple, he says, as a theatre maker slash producer in the arts, I'm looking to make a theatre show that's detective murder mystery. So I consider the following two purchases as research and therefore tax deductible.
He's got Hotel Dusk for £8, so a little bit more than the last person who paid £4.50, and Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations for £33.95.
Hmm. So I'm going to let Phoenix Wright go because I believe in the ethos of, like, get the original DS carts. It's got to be done.
I get it, you know? Like, the fonts, the touch screen interface, like, every version of Phoenix Wright after this is slightly worse. It's like it was never more at home than it was here.
Trials and Trials and Tribs is a good one as well, isn't it? That's, like, the third one, like, the amazing one. So, yeah, that's fine.
Hotel Dust, I don't know, maybe the price has spiked after you talked about it on an episode of the podcast, Matthew. So you had to pay £8 instead of £4.20 or whatever. Gosh, I want to hold Kirby against him.
That's all of them, right?
Oh, we've got a couple more. There's a lot of these. There's loads and loads.
It's quite hard to weigh them all up. He bought the three PS2 Batman games, Batman Begins, Batman Vengeance and Batman Rise of Sin Tzu, I think I'm pronouncing that right, for £14.17. I was riding high after watching The Batman and had already completed the Arkham series.
I just wanted to slide that purchase.
Yeah, I mean, if they won't make any more Batman games, what are you supposed to do, except buy all the old bad ones? These weren't bad though, actually. I'm being quite harsh there.
They were like 6 out of 10s at the time, Batman Vengeance. I didn't play the Rise of Sin Tzu, but I understand that's a direct continuation of Batman Vengeance, animated series actors and your basic action adventure platformery game. £14 are right for that.
I spend £14 way worse than that.
There was another 3D Batman that was meant to be terrible, Dark Tomorrow or something?
Yeah, was that not like a GameCube game?
I always remember, it might have been Geraint actually, formerly of NGC, who told me a story about someone coming to show that game, and the PR was the only person allowed to play it, and it was so broken that Batman kept... There's one bit in the level where you had to jump over this gap, and Batman kept falling down, and the PR kept falling down this hole, until he got so cross, he screamed in the middle of the preview session, I HATE THIS FUCKING GAME!
Wow, that's amazing.
There's a little free Batman story.
Wow, jeez, that'll be me one day as a PR.
That is the exact opposite of what you're meant to say as a PR for a game.
I think I did get like 3 out of 10s and stuff though. I remember it being around at the start of the GameCube times, people were saying, oh yeah, this Batman game is coming. And the screens they put out, which are obviously from some pre-rendered trailer, looked amazing.
And you're like, oh, is this going to be a gritty, exciting Batman game? And it was just genuinely terrible. I don't know how there were so many Batman games for such a long time.
It's really weird that that's now a series we associate with prestige.
How does Michael Caine deal with seeing his virtual doppelganger in Batman Begins?
He doesn't get that far into the game. He rejects the concept of video games on principle because he's in his 80s.
He's seen them take too many lives.
He looks at it and someone shows him, this is Alfred in the game. He's like, that looks nothing like me and then he turns it off again. Then he goes to vote for Brexit or whatever he does.
Yes, good. Michael Caine.
Finally, Marvel vs Capcom Infinite for £13.95.
Fucking hell. How many entries has he got?
I bought this drunk at a KFC in Edinburgh. That doesn't make any sense.
Jesus, this man's lived a very rich life based on this.
How do you buy a copy of this in KFC?
I seem like he ate a KFC and then went and bought it, like a mad chicken bender.
He says, I bought this drunk at a KFC in Edinburgh.
At a KFC?
He didn't mean CEX and it ought to change to KFC, because he's writing KFC so much on his phone. Probably meant KFC, right? Because that's what you're normally talking about.
His phone says judgmentally.
Yeah, I got a mini-fillet and the worst version of Marvel vs Capcom. Good God, there's a lot to weigh up here. This man has taken me on an odyssey.
I've been on a journey here. The entire courtroom has stood up being like, wow, Intergalactic Warlord Gandhi's like, wow, this is changing my entire perspective on life. Captain Toad just poked his head out of the shit bow.
I was like, oh, what's going on? Little light on his little mushroom head.
Everyone was kind of quite captivated. There's some legit good choices in here mixed with interesting muddled choices.
Where did you land on God Hand at 63.35?
Yeah, I've got to say yes to that because God Hand is one of the foundational games of this podcast, I would say. I know it's expensive, but no one bought it. Prices have crept up over the years.
The easiest way to play this is to get a PS3, or if you already have a PS3, go onto the PlayStation Network, eight quid and a copy of this will be yours and you can play it and see what the fuss is about. That is cool. He could have done that, but the idea of adding it to your collection, I see the appeal, so I'm going to have to forgive that one, Matthew.
But Kirby, don't forgive Kirby. Is that the best one? Did we talk about this?
It's beloved by the fans, because it's the DS update of the SNES game, which is full of all the mad little mini games. So it's got that, but it's also the first... Oh, I've completely forgotten his name now.
It's been so long since we did Kirby. My brain's falling apart.
The guy is like the Kirby custodian now.
Yeah, Mr. Kirby Kamazaki, I think his name is... This is the one that he kind of looked after and started sort of shoving in all his mad govins. So it's a kind of vital text for him.
I don't know. It is beloved by the fan base and it is hard to come by.
Okay, I'm gonna give this guy... Gonna let this guy off. I think, like, I just...
I really enjoyed the picks. I thought this was a great example of a Games Court entry. You know what I mean?
It pulled us all over the place. Probably the duffest pick in there is Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, which is still not a bad game.
It just doesn't have any X-Men in it, which is a tough break.
Yeah, and he got it at KFC, which is like an interesting quirk.
Yeah, I mean, we are all still wondering how that even happened. The Batman games, that's a really interesting little bundle of stuff. I would totally see myself spending 14 quid playing them all for 10 minutes each and then never again.
That is a noble pursuit.
And yet, God Hand is the lowest reviewed by IGN of all these games.
I tell you what, we should send IGN to Lord Brisby.
The guy who reviewed that, Matthew, has probably not worked there for like 15 years.
Doesn't matter. Never forget. Never forgive.
Into the boat. Quora form for a lot of them. How big is their staff?
Probably 100, 150 people?
We're not putting Scribs in the boat for Lord Brisby. That's not what's going to happen.
Scribs get spared. So he can warn the others and tell them why it happened.
Right, moving on.
Exhibit C is from Nathan Brady Eastman. This is a bit of a goofy one, but I thought I'd include it, because I wanted to know how much he values these things.
I like Nathan. He's like, you know, a PC gamer pod, listens to this, good for my ego, founds a lot of the tweets, you know.
We've kind of broken the pre-owned game rule here, but I'm allowing it. He wants to know if buying a collection of 200 issues of edge magazines, pre-owned edge magazines, for £94 is a good purchase.
200 issues?
Yeah.
That's a good purchase. Like, if you've got the space for it, this is the thing, right? I would own loads more magazines if I owned a house.
I don't. I own a tiny little flat. But if you have the space for it, then 200 issues of edge sounds very appealing to me.
Like, you can just pick one up on any given day and just flick through and be like, oh, yeah, I'll read this review of Mission Impossible on N64, you know? So, 94 quid, that's really good. You see people trying to complete their collections and you'll see on eBay that people charge like 10 quid for them and stuff.
So, yeah. Did you have a funny story to go along with it or was that it?
No, it was just really to the point.
Okay. Well, cheers. You are free, sir.
You will not be sailing out with Lord Brispy.
He's got his work cut out with him because of all the IGN people we just sent down the tunnel. Exhibit D from Bjorn. All right, this is a long one.
He told us a very long story, but it is worth it in the end, so you're really going to have to bear with me.
I'm going to mute myself while I drink some water.
Okay. The case I bring before you is not the usual prostration of unmitigated impulsivity and reckless cashing by a wayward gamer. Instead, I approach the bench as a plaintiff, seeking not restitution but recognition for a heinous crime committing it against a much younger self.
If I'm guilty of anything, it's of not speaking up earlier, though the tale you'll read has been told before. I bought a used copy of Doom 3 for PC in January of 2005 in its original packaging from the now-defunct in the US chain, Electronics Boutique. At this point, over 15 years later, I cannot recall how much it cost, but I can assure you whatever dollar amount passed between mortal hands was nowhere near worth the chunk of my soul lost on this day.
Everyone remembers their first time, and this was it. Doom was the first M4 mature game that I had purchased for myself, and was quite excited to see what all the hype was about. Though let it be known that, not being a veteran of survival horror, I was truly concerned the jump scares would get to me, but thought, fuck it, I've already been through Ravenholm.
That said, I really wasn't prepared for the experience to come. A blizzard in late January brought record-breaking snow in New England, leaving the roads an awful mix of compacted slush on the median and unforgiving ice along the shoulders. This was made all the worse by my classic car, a diminutive Saturn twin cam, with its go-kart-like handling and nearly bald tyres.
My afternoon commute went from a breezy 15-20 minute drive on clear roads into an arduous 40. Fish-tailing down hills and skidding gracefully through intersections, I must have had enough adrenaline in my veins to kill a pinkie. Sorry, I was just trying to work out what that was.
That's the doom enemy yet. Yet with white knuckles, I eagerly looked at this new game resting on the passenger seat, imagining that whatever version of digital hell it had to offer would be better than the one I was currently experiencing. When I finally arrived home, safe and sound, I saw that the plough was kind enough to block my driveway with a drift up to my chest.
So much to my dismay, my dream of killing demons would have to wait while I shoveled the driveway in a hard northeastern gale. If I had in that moment beckoned for the fires of hell to warm my hands and aching back, I cannot remember. But if dark deals were made out of it, it was out of necessity, not negligence.
Warming up with some hot chocolate, the moment of unboxing had finally come. With steel cold and shivering... had you read this post?
No, not at all.
Warming up with some hot chocolate, the moment of unboxing had finally come. With steel cold and shivering hands, I cut open EB. Games sticker on the box.
That served as a foreboding seal for this unassuming package, then eagerly dumped its contents onto my bed. Now, Your Honours, surprise falls far short of what I felt as along with the double decker jewel case and manual, were what I could only guess were what I could only guess were three to six months wait one sec Honours, surprise falls far short of what I felt as along with the double decker jewel case and manual, were what I could only guess were three to six months of cubic hair trimmings.
Out of the upturned box, and onto my bedspread. The moment I realized what was happening, terror struck deep into myself. With mouth agape, I stared at this mound of pubes utterly flabbergasted.
Oh my god.
Artically flabbergasted at the inexplicable horror that had befallen my young and naive self. I stared out my bedroom window at the snow, dancing in the grave in light, pondering who would do this? Why me?
After all this? And what the hell am I going to do with this accursed heap of biological waste on the very same place that I slept? But reflecting on the trials before the pubic even, I took a sip of my hot chocolate, gathered myself and thought, fuck it, I've already been through Ravenholm.
With nimble fingers, I extracted the dual case from the hellish briar and installed the four-disc behemoth. Installations back in the day took a while, so with that time afforded, I cleaned up this chinchilla-sized tumbleweed from my bed and began washing my sheets. Started the game up and didn't even flinch.
Later things got awkward when my brother, who shared a room with me, came home to me washing the sheets and a trash can filled with short and curlies. Oh well, time to kill demons. Crime of the century right there.
I actually think that was amazing. An amazing story. Spoilers for Black Mirror season 6.
That's like Charlie Brooker's, just try and keep these plotlines secret, but I think right there we see the chilling sort of vision of modern life and technology intersecting. Right, did not see that twist coming. Incredible, it's incredible.
It's just so obnoxious, what an obnoxious thing to do.
That's a proper like, you know, sort of, where to start? I mean, it's like the end of a movie that. That's like the end of The Usual Suspects, you know what I mean?
It's like that level of like, twist, where you're like, somewhere like Kevin Spacey's turning from a hobble to a walk. He's the man who dropped all the pubes into the copy of Doom. So, oh my god, that was so good.
I feel like that is like maybe one of the best moments of our podcast this year, and it was completely out of our hands. That has hurt me, that has hurt my chest from laughter. Yeah, so I got a bit confused of the timeframe here.
So this happened a long time ago, is that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Right, so this was like Doom back in the day.
This was January in 2005, yeah. They actually pre-owned PC games, so I don't remember that being a big thing here.
Well, yeah, it was for a while before they started doing the registration codes that would make you basically very light DRM and before Steam existed. This is original Doom.
Doom 3.
Doom 3, right, okay. Gosh, I mean you didn't know there was going to be pubes in it when you bought it. Just objectively, you know.
That's, gotta say that up front. I actually think that story would have been beautiful if you'd have ended it with, fuck it, I've already been through Raven.
Yeah, that's a good end. Maybe I will cut it there.
That's like a great sort of short story last line where it leads back to something early on. That's like classic short storytelling there. Yeah, I'm gonna say innocent, but the person who dropped the pubes in, I'm dispatching Colt Phelps to find them, and they will be sent to Lord Brisby.
It probably was Lord Brisby. That's a classic Lord Brisby move, packing in a load of pubes into a copy of Doom 3.
Yeah, absolutely.
Like we say, we have no idea what that fucking gets up to down that canal.
Yeah, real zag there from Lord Brisby. Yeah, zagging. Okay, Jesus Christ.
Well, we have no dead people so far, which is disappointing.
Yeah, tough act to follow.
Yeah, that's like one of the best Games Court entries ever.
I'm so glad you hadn't read that beforehand, because when I read it, that really made me laugh so loud last night when I was putting this together. And yeah.
Is this the guy who started writing it into the Discord then realised he didn't have enough space, so emailed it in? Is it that guy?
Well, he wrote it across three posts because he maxed out the word count.
Oh, I did see a lot of our listeners reacting to it actually. So that might explain it.
Yeah, that's Bill. And I know he's a listener of the RPS podcast as well. And he's a bit of a galaxy brain, I think.
Holy shit. Well, good. I was not ready for that.
Well, Games Court has peaked, but nonetheless, let's carry on.
Let's carry on. So, exhibit E is from Koig. He bought a pre-owned copy of Empire of Sin for £10.75.
He said he was going through a big prohibition phase after watching Boardwalk Empire and The Untouchables and reading the excellent history of a history of the period called The Last Call. So, he had to pick up this game because he saw it described as XCOM meets The Untouchables, which is a great pitch, but he didn't realise it was on Game Pass when he bought it. So, that's £10.75.
I'll never see it again.
He said he bought it pre-owned, yeah?
Yeah.
I don't know if you get this physically, but I'll take Coig's word for it. Yeah, you know, like, buying games that are already on Game Pass.
By mistake.
Yeah, I guess so.
I did that recently with Day of the Tentacle and Biker Bollocks, whatever it's called.
Yeah, Biker Bollocks Remastered, I think it was called.
Full Throttle.
Yeah, and plus then it was on a humble bundle as well. Yeah, I really beefed that one. Yeah, I always wanted to play this, but I understood that it fell short a little bit of the potential of it, Matthew.
At least that was what I heard about it. It maybe wasn't quite as good as it could have been. I think they did patch it up a bit.
I've no idea if it got improved vastly. For me, this is like a classic dip into Game Pass and see what the deal is kind of game just because it got mixed views.
We've got a couple more from him to bundle in with that.
Oh, okay, fine.
So he bought a bundle for six pounds of Premier Manager 98, Premier Manager 99 and Alex Ferguson's Player Manager 2001 on the PlayStation one for six pounds.
Big Matthew Castle favorites there, those ones. He says another bundle as well.
This was six pounds for three different games. Yes, Premier Manager 99 famously had Kevin Keegan on the cover, which I do remember because it was on the cover of N64 magazine. It's an issue of that where you go from like iconic Nintendo and rare faces to just a rather glum Kevin Keegan.
Yeah, I would say one of the icons of the N64 era, Kevin Keegan.
Why is Kevin Keegan not in Smash?
Yeah, he's an interesting figure, Kevin Keegan. He's sort of like, he reminds me of me a bit. Is that all the games?
And finally, Turning Point Fall of Liberty for three quid.
That's an interesting bunch.
I believe, in fact, on Discord, you may have seen that one and called it. That is a definitive Games Court pitch.
Yeah, it really is. You've got run the whole gamut there. You've got a three out of ten FPS from Cove Masters.
And you've got football games I don't really understand. And then Empire of Sin. What a weird bunch that is.
So it strikes me that I think Premier Manager was kind of like, I guess there might be some nostalgia there. I don't remember these games being acclaimed. It's certainly like this was the era where Championship Manager became big.
I don't really know those games. They're too granular for my brain. I was more of an LMA manager guy.
Those games were Cody's Games. They were very good. They were PS2 management.
I'm pretty sure that my bad eyesight can be attributed to trying to play, to read the text in those games on my tiny TV video combi from the noughties. I'm pretty sure that fucked my eyesight. What are you going to say, Matthew?
Well, I'd say I like that you talked about these games not being memorable, because the anecdote that Cody shares with us about the premium manager games is I have a vivid memory of playing it with the official PlayStation 1 mouse, but upon consulting the Wikipedia page, list of games compatible with the PlayStation mouse, I was crestfallen to learn that I'd seemingly imagined this.
That's tough when a thing didn't happen that you thought would happen.
That's like something I dread doing on this podcast, where I'll be like, yeah, you know me with my PlayStation mouse, and then someone will write in going, that game didn't work with the PlayStation mouse, and then I have to just backtrack horribly.
Yeah, that's it. Or like when I'm cutting out bits of the podcast at last minute, because I say that Mafia the City Lost Heaven came out in late 2002, but actually came out early 2002, so I just locked out the word late from the pod for it went live. How ridiculous is that?
You really did that stat surgical edit on that thing I'd already edited.
Yeah, I did. But I had a couple of other bits I cut as well. Just factual errors I picked up on.
I got the button wrong for getting in the car in the getaway. Oh, right.
Refer to Jeremy as David for the whole podcast. That was awkward.
Yeah, he was very good-natured about it though. I'm going to kill this guy, Matthew.
Nice.
I think like this is no reason to buy Turning Point. I mean, I get the basic curiosity, but this was not well-reviewed at the time. Just go watch that HBO show that was really good, that David Simon did, The Plot Against America.
That was basically like a clever clogs version of this and not like the dumbass version of What If Nazis in America, you know what I mean? So yeah, that's my take, Matthew.
So, Coy gives off to Lord Brisby. Ironically, Lord Brisby calls his bedroom Empire of Sin. Have fun.
Oh dear, you should write for television, my friend. Next up.
Exhibit F from Madbrood. Here's one for the big lads to deliberate over. In a nostalgia-fueled searching session in which I tried to find enjoyable PC games from yesteryear, I happened upon a copy of Far Cry 2-alike Boiling Point on eBay.
Atari's seminal RPG-cum-FPS from 2005 starring the pixelated visage of Arnold Voslough. A game so janky and bug-ridden, it must surely be the trespasser of the next PC games draft, but I digress. £8.99 plus postage and I still haven't been able to play it because my GTX 980 doesn't have enough VRAM to satisfy the 128MB requirements.
Wow.
There's a blast from the past.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, that didn't come up in the relevant draft. It's a 2005 game and obviously we didn't pick Boiling Point.
Kind of a weird one because apparently, like, reviewers who played the unpatched version said it was terrible. PC Gamer said, unless it receives some extreme patching, don't bother with this game. And then, like, Games TM said, Atari has landed itself an absolute classic here, a must-have, no questions asked.
That sounds like a classic sort of like brain fart there from, like, mid-North East Games TM. The pre-Ashley Day days.
Oh, not an Ashley's watch.
Oh, FPS and RPG? I've got to admit, this has, like, piqued my interest, like, just hearing about it. Who the fuck is Arnold Vosley?
Do you know who that is?
Yeah, the mummy from The Mummy.
Oh, right. I was sort of, like, I don't know. I thought, when you said Arnold, I thought the rest of it would be Schwarzenegger.
No, no, he's that, he's also, I think he's the baddie in 24 season 4.
Oh, he's got quite a memorable face, actually. Like, what a weird selling point, though. Just to be, like, in Atari's offices in, like, the mid-noughties, and, like, guys, we're gonna drop, like, 90 grand to hire Arnold Vosley, but I think it's gonna supercharge our marketing campaign.
Like, I would just love to have been there for that conversation.
I've got, unexpectedly, I've got an anecdote about Arnold Vosley in 24 season 4.
Go for it.
When I was at... Have I told you this one about the top trumps?
The Arnold Vosley top trumps story is coming up blank.
I'll be quick. When I was at university, I bought a pack of 24 top trumps, and, you know, they had various different categories on them, like, you know, gun skill or athleticism or whatever, but one of the criteria by which they'd be competing was dedication to the cause, which they were scored out of ten. And Habib Marwan was scored one out of ten for dedication to the cause, despite the fact that at the end of his season in 24, spoiler alert, he jumps off a car park and kills himself rather than reveal where he's hidden a bomb, which I would argue is, like, the very definition of dedication to the cause.
So I wrote an email to top Trumps complaining about this, saying I thought they'd really misunderstood the category, because it wasn't dedication to, like, the hero's cause. It was dedication to any cause, because there were other terrorists who were, like, seven and eight out of ten. But, like, all his lieutenants and deputies were rated higher than him.
Like, he's the guy. He led the charge. He killed himself.
He's like a literal suicide bomber. So, yeah, I wrote to them, and they sent me an email back saying they took all criticisms very seriously, and that was the last I ever heard from them.
Yeah, I'm guessing they didn't, for the next printing, change that. I'd have just put the value for every single category, for every single card, 24. I'd have just done that, like, the number 24, and everyone would have been like, oh, that's funny.
You can't play as a game, but what a great gag that is.
That was caught. I think they really phone it in, Top Trumps. I think they get the licence to something, and then they're just, like, banging any old numbers.
Like, we saw, again, this happened later, I was playing Lord of the Rings, Top Trumps.
Why do you have so many versions of it?
I was playing Lord of the Rings, Top Trumps, and there was a category for, like, it wasn't heroism, but it was some kind of, like, maybe it was, like, leadership, and Candel's Horse, Shadow Fax, had, like, a higher leadership racing than, like, anyone in the Fellowship apart from Aragorn. And I just liked the idea that this horse was, like, more charismatic than, like, Boromir, Gimli, you know, any of them.
Was it higher than Gandalf as well?
Yeah.
What, so, like...
In this person's mind, the most charismatic motherfucker in Middle Earth is Aragorn than just under him, Shadow Fax.
Amazing.
This was someone who just gave not one shit about their job of assigning numbers to the criteria for the Lord of the Rings Top Trumps card.
How many versions of Top Trumps have you played at this point?
Well, there are like hundreds of versions, right? They're like Funko. Every IP under the sun has Top Trumps.
You've got to remember, I'm hoarding Borderlands 2 Top Trumps.
I mean, I haven't forgotten. That's why I bring it up. But it's like, how far are we going here?
Is it like the kind of, oh, I've got the rules of attraction Top Trumps. Like, I've got James Van Der Beek and he's like an 86.
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean? Like, what is the sort of...
I've got Dogville Top Trumps.
I've got Martyrs Top Trumps.
Oh, the Julian Glover's got like a 64 for like charisma. Oh, that's really funny. Okay, so where were we with this?
Arnold Crosley and Boiling Point.
Oh, yeah.
All I remember about Boiling Point was that some of the RPS founders, they were really into it. It was their kind of like emergent chaos PC game and they used to write endless blogs about how good it was even though it was broken as shit.
Yeah, to be honest Matthew, this sounds like if we were a bit more of a kind of PC focused podcast than we are, this sounds like our sort of thing. So I'm going to let Mad Brood off for this one because I think that's an interesting purchase. And you can't actually get it anywhere else.
Like I was looking at it. I mean, get it from my abandonware or something, but it's not on GOG. I would pay money to play that.
So how can I kill someone who did it themselves? That's what I ask you. Okay, so it's a rhetorical question.
You could kill him and have his copy.
What, and then send him to Lord Brisby but play the game myself? Yeah, okay, let's do that.
I think you inherit the games from the people you send to Lord Brisby.
That completely changes things.
Yeah, it really does. That's a terrible rule. I'm instantly going back on that.
It makes me feel pretty good about killing Koig though, because I don't really want those premier manager games or Empire Sin, so that's fine. Okay, well then, yeah, Mabry can survive, because I think this is a legit interesting pick, so next exhibit.
Exhibit G is from Big Chief Zangief. It's a recent submission, but I've got a lifetime of questionable decisions I could put forward. Last month I bought Japanese PSP copies of The Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky FC, which was £13.49, and Naota No Kiseki for £12 from eBay.
He adds, I can't read or understand Japanese, and even if I could, the UMD drive on my PSP doesn't work.
This is bait, you know what I mean?
I played English ROM hacks of them both, and have played the whole trial series, going to put them on a shelf. The instruction books are really nice.
Okay.
Is this bait?
This feels like Tom Hardy Mad Max GIF bait. It's like a bit of the old, you know, we've discussed this before, if you're not going to actually play the game, we're going to have to kill you. But then you have played one of the games.
I don't know much about the other one, to be honest.
Well, that night in Okoseki, I was watching a little video of it. I actually look quite nifty for a PSP game. Kind of real-time action-y jobber.
I don't really know what you'd liken it to, in that you're jumping around and swiping a sword in real time. It is getting an updated Western release on PC, PS4 and Switch next year.
Is it from the same people as like the Trails in the Sky?
I think it's a Neon Falcon one. I've got to put my hand up and say, the whole Trails, Legends of Heroes thing is becoming an increasingly worrying blind spot, in that more people seem to be talking about these games, and I have no fucking clue where to start.
Yeah, I think this is like several sub-series that connect, but I do believe that a current run of them does start all the way back on PSP. I think that's how it started, or at least maybe there's two on PSP. But yeah, you do hear a few people just go to battle for this.
I know there's Sam, our moderator in the Discord, is big on these games. Blind spot for me too. Gosh, if you actually did play the games as like ROM hacks, and you actually paid for it, I think that's a reasonably good excuse.
Do we have prices in the end there?
Yeah, £13.49 for Trails and £12 for Night and No Kiseki.
Yeah, that's okay. I've bought a couple of limited editions before for similar prices, back when I wanted the book edition of Alan Wake to put on my shelf and make me look very unintelligent next to all my other graphic novels.
Especially if it's the only book you own.
That and Star Wars tie-in novels and nothing else.
That and Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina. Oh yes, I have all the classic works.
Yeah, Shadows of the Empire by Steve Perry. Yeah, okay. Oh dear, it's true within it should be.
Yeah, okay, gonna forgive this one. Not creating much drama here.
It's been forgiven even though it's obvious bait. But listen, that works for me. Exhibit H from Margin Walker.
It's been slightly over a year since I began listening to the podcast regularly and following the very first Games Court episode, I began buying used DS and 3DS games. Something which, for whatever reason, I had never considered doing before. Here is the full list of games I've bought.
Since most of these were not purchased using Pound Sterling, I have converted the prices for EA's, thank you very much, using current conversion rates. This was a few months ago, so that's now fucked. When judging me, please keep in mind, I live in a fairly remote country.
Shipping here is expensive, as is buying games locally. I guarantee your currency stretches further now. No, no, it would stretch further now.
Bad luck for you. Here we go, we've got a lot of these. Super Marriot 3D Land, cartridge only, £12.61.
Hotel Dusk, £14.42, the most expensive copy so far.
Right, yeah.
Chrono Trigger DS, £42.54. Hmm, highly desirable.
I don't think that's a bad price for it. It's an elusive one. It's the best version of Chrono Trigger.
Pokémon Soul Silver DS, £14.04.
That's a fake copy, I guarantee it. There's no way. I'm sorry to break it to you.
In brackets, he says, cartridge only, reproduction game most likely.
Yeah, I'm going to say, check if the font isn't embossed on the back, I'm afraid that's a fake. Oh man.
I hope you don't get handed over to Lord Brisby because of an embossed font or not. That's a tough break. Final Fantasy 4 on DS, £32.83.
Not my preferred version of Final Fantasy 4.
I thought that was a loved version with the little 3D cinematics.
Well, those look nice, but the visual style in the 3D, I thought it looked quite rough compared to Final Fantasy 4 Complete Edition on PSP, which had the lovely pixel art. Nicest up-brace pixel art I've seen in a game. Sorry, here's more.
The world ends with you, DS, £13.50.
That's a good price.
That's cartridge only, I should say.
Probably again another fake copy, but keep going.
Metroid Samus Returns, £33.61.
Quite high prices here, but I remember the caveat.
GTA Chinatown Wars, £13.00.
Good price.
Link Between Worlds, £18.32.
Seems reasonable.
Link's Awakening Switch, £19.59. That's it, those are what we have.
There's no peril here, because all the games are good. There's no… I sort of like…
What I'm going to do, though, is I'm going to punish you for not looking at eBay sellers carefully enough. You should have looked. Is that a reproduction copy?
Oh yeah, I think that's fair.
Exactly. I think that's just… That is tough, because I bought a couple of…
I got stung by this myself and got a couple of two good prices for things, and then later I had a proper think about, oh, are these real or not? And then did my great audit of which games are fake and which are real last year, and my Apollo Justice copy was fake, and Pokémon is particularly bad for this. There's just so many people selling fake carts and eBay doing nothing about it, which is terrible, I think.
They should fucking police that. It did work, but people say that it wears out after a while, it would just stop working, and it's very different to owning the proper copy. But owning the proper copy of Pokémon SoulSilver HeartGold, that will set you back, it's a very beloved version of that game.
It did work, but Apollo Justice did work, but everything Trucey said was in Italian.
Yeah and he was called Apollo Juice as well, like that was a mistake throughout.
Yeah, that would have ring a long bell.
His little hair spikes were the wrong way around as well. It was tough. So yeah, I'm going to say I'm going to punish you on grounds of piracy and for submitting an entry that was too full of good games to create any parallel drama for this courtroom.
Oh man, I mean really, that judgement should be on me for selecting this particular message.
Well you know, I just think that you've got to learn your lesson about, you know, I don't care if you're shipping them to the middle of like, I don't know, a desert or wherever you live. That was not made clear from the entry. But I'm not having it.
I think he lives in Israel.
Okay, we don't need to get in at all that. Let's move on. He's already gone.
He's already shipping away with Lord Brisby. The boat is already out of my line of sight.
Let's do it.
Let's move on.
Oh, he's from Shamrock. Hi, Judge, slash Defense Lawyer, slash PS1 Hagrid, if he's here.
Just PS1 Jeremy Peel, I'm afraid.
Yeah, he's just as fun, right kids? Anyone?
That's no shade on Jeremy, I think Jeremy's great. I would much rather hang out with Jeremy and Hagrid. If we'd had Hagrid on the episode talking about GTA clones, that episode would not have been a triumph.
No, no, this, yeah, that would have been like...
If we were doing an episode about magical plants, Hagrid all the way.
Yeah, and if one of us was called Harry, that would have been like great, you know. But I don't think PS1 Hagrid has deep points of view on Driver 3's portrayal of Niece and whether Michael Mann is a serious influence or not.
Well, actually, I'm a big fan of that level where you have to drive the motorbikes into the lorry. You're like, fuck me, Hagrid, you've got great takes. Anyway.
It was all right, but it was worse than Vice City. And it's like, wow, yeah, this guy really gets it.
I wish I'd been able to have done an impression. It might be it would have landed just as well as this.
Well, I've had a glass of wine, so what can you say?
You've hit wine Sammy.
Yeah, that's it.
It's like your equivalent of Kratos' rage mode. Right. Shamrock says, I've got a good old fashioned games and prices list here.
It's all in euros. Oh, fuck it. Well, I haven't translated it, but I think it's like, isn't it basically one euro is one pound, I think?
It used to be, yeah.
This is a rough week to be talking about currency. They're really rubbing it in our faces, this one. Right.
Games and prices. Luigi's Mansion 2, Dark Moon, 20 euros. Make 10, A Journey of Numbers, DS, 8 euros.
What the fuck is that?
Now, this is a weird one because we didn't even review this on Nintendo Gamer. And it's a Nintendo published maths puzzle game.
What?
Where every game in it is built around number puzzles adding up to 10. So it looks like it could almost be a brain training type thing. But it's drawn in this weird ass doodle style.
It's like a Sudoku-y thing.
No, it's not even that. It's like in one of the games, two things will pop up holding number plates. And you have to quickly press yes or no about whether or not they add up to 10.
Really, the punchline to every game is either is or isn't 10.
The least fun version of WarioWare, you can imagine.
It's WarioWare, 300 games about what adds up to 10. Jesus Christ. A genuine curio, though.
This one even passed me by. Yeah. Zack and Wiki on the Wii for 15 euros.
Right, that's bait.
Little King's Story on the Wii for 5 euros.
That's bait.
Another code R, that's the Wii sing game for £2.50 on euros.
Fuck me, did you send this one in Matthew? Jesus Christ.
We've not actually talked much about another code R, mainly because it's not very good.
Really isn't that like a sing game, right?
It is, but it's like the slightly bad Wii one. It was 20, yeah, I don't know. It didn't really do it for me.
We will cover it at some point. I'm not sure how, because we've passed every possible thing. But maybe if we do the sing hall of fame, spoiler alert, this doesn't make it.
Oh yeah, we did the Wii draft and didn't come up during that. Yeah.
Dishonored, three euros.
That is a left turn from the last few. Koko, keep going.
Binary domain, six euros. That had no box. It was supposed to come with a box, but the lad in the store couldn't find it and told me someone must have stolen it off the shelf.
You know how it is. And then he gave me two quid off as a result.
That's good. Good negotiating. Very good.
He adds at the end though that he's only played Make 10 and Luigi's Mansion. He hasn't played any of the others.
That's quite a milquetoe selection of games that don't move me either way, I would say. So, we've got some prime Matthew Castle bait in there. Like, absolutely, you know, Little King's Story, fine.
You know, like, um, Zack and Wiki. I'm told these are good. These are games I've not played.
I myself bought Zack and Wiki after hearing Matthew talk about it on the 2008 or 2009 episode, whichever one it was. That was, you know, good selling, good upselling on some NGamer classics. Gosh, there's not really much to hang a verdict off here.
They're all just like, oh, yeah, fine. You know what I mean? Like, there's no egregious prices.
So for that reason, I'm going to send them to Lord Brisby because I feel like I needed to be moved either way. Like, there wasn't enough peril created. So I'm creating peril for you.
Who knows what happens to you after you sail off with Lord Brisby, but you are now property of him. So I wish you the very best.
I don't think you'll be having a deep and long conversation about another Kodar.
I don't think he's into that, no. I don't want to talk about what he's into. That's like kept a mystery for the purposes of the courtroom.
So yeah, that's a no, I'm afraid, dog. What's next, Matthew?
Exhibit J is from Kurt. Oh, this is another weird one. Not quite games, but maybe interesting.
Hi gents. This isn't a game purchase, but it is gaming related. During one of the lockdowns when I was perhaps going through a stir crazy phase, I thought I would buy strategy guides for some of my favourite games, but tried to get them for a good price.
The most I spent was £10 on a Skyward Sword guide. Others I bought were Deus Ex Human Revolution, The Orange Box, Vice City San Andreas, GTA IV and GTA V. They all look nice, however, and even if I know deep down I'm likely to use them.
The thing which might save me from death is that I think some of these could be valuable one day. Uh-oh, he's wandered into the old Speculate to Accumulate. I wish I hadn't read out that last bit now.
I should have kept it when someone was trying to buy something a bit quirky. I must admit I've never purchased a guide in my life. So I don't really have any kind of frame of reference for how nice or interesting these things are.
So the GTA ones were genuinely nice documents, but there's no prices here, right?
Well, the most was £10 for Scoward Sword, so cheaper than £10.
I don't really know what the value is of buying one for Deus Ex Human Revolution. That's a pretty straightforward game to play, really. You wouldn't really get stuck looking for it.
Unless it's got all the alternative endings.
Well, maybe.
You could read in and go like, oh, this is what I didn't do. That's interesting. I must be desperately trying to save him from more prisby.
You did your bit. You earned your retainer there, Matthew.
I'm going to be honest. I would never fill my house with fucking game guides. The idea of giving over precious shelf space for that.
That's even worse than my Alan Wake book edition. My friend Andrew still has that, actually. It's actually a really nice edition.
It's actually the best book I've read.
I've got it next to the What's It Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.
That Alan Wake book isn't just a fictional book from the game, is it?
No, I don't think it's got a book in it. It's shaped like a book, but it's just got the game in it and then something else.
I thought it might be a bit like you can buy the books by the guy from Castle, the show about the crime writer.
Yeah, not you.
No, they've written some books by that. You can buy Castle's fictional books in the real world.
That's like that book. Was it like Bad Twin from Lost that they did? It was meant to be like, I have a few friends who bought that book and said it was a pile of shit, but they bought it because they want to learn more about Lost.
Spoiler alert, they didn't. I'm sure that publisher was happy to make eight quid or whatever.
But that wasn't written by a character in the book, was it? In the fitness show?
Yeah, it was. It was like a character like you. I think you hear about very briefly or something.
And then it touches on the events in the show. It was like a weird thing. I think it was Bad Twin, something like that.
It came out. Yeah, it's about 2005 time. Yeah.
I really want one of these stories, Matthew, to be like, I was going through some bad shit in like 2005, so I dropped a load of pubes into my edition of Doom 3.
What a twist.
I want to hear the reverse of that story. I traded it in and then got a copy of...
That's the better call soul of emails that we'll receive. It's the very long story of how those pubes came to be in that box.
So this is Games Court. This is not Games Walkthrough Court. That is a different barge floating in the Atlantic Ocean.
Nothing to do with us. So I think it's going to have to be Lord Brisby for Kurt. Quietly floating away with his guides.
Your guides will be in your boat with you. They won't save you, but they'll be there.
You belong to Brisby. Next up, Matthew.
Tough, brave Kurt. Exhibit K is from Chris Bush. Thanks to a rainy day in Perth whilst on holiday recently, I found myself in the Nostalgia Box, a retro gaming museum with my wife and two kids.
One of the games they had set up to play was Guitar Hero, which I had not played in years. The kids were fascinated and enjoyed watching me stumble through a few tracks on increasingly easy difficulty modes as I realised that I wasn't as good at it as I would have remembered. I'd also forgotten quite how much fun this game could be, so as soon as we got home I decided to scour the local second hand site for instruments and the games.
This was much harder than it might have been if I'd been in the UK, which may be reflected in what I ended up paying. I've converted the prices from Singapore dollars to British pounds, so these are Singaporean copies of Rock Band games. Oh, there's quite a lot here and they're quite complicated because they're a mixture of games and instruments.
So they're all for PS3. So, Rock Band 1, Band in a Box, that's the game, guitar, drums and mic, £35.
That's a good price.
Yeah. Guitar Hero Smash Hit, Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero Legends of Rock, £9 for all three.
I think we're getting into the territory where they were dragging it out at this point, Activision. They were like, oh, the train's going to be over soon, so keep fucking shoveling coal in there.
Not for this family, they love it. Rock Band 2, Rock Band 3, Lego Rock Band plus two Rock Band guitars, £25.
Fucking Lego Rock Band. Why did that happen?
And Guitar Hero 3 guitar and another Rock Band keyboard for £20.
Jesus Christ, this family really likes this shit.
By my calculations, that's like five guitars they've got at this point. Well, he summarises at the end, I have two working guitars, one working drums and a working mic. I'm still trying to get the keyboard, so all that and he hasn't got the keyboard.
Yeah, but the keyboard was like, wasn't that much later? There was like an edge cover with that keyboard on, right? Like it was like a Rock Band 3 cover?
Yeah, that's Rock Band 3, which he does have the game, but I'd argue like you were going to go all out. I'd try and get the Rock Band keyboard before I tried to get a copy of Lego Rock Band.
Fuck me a keyboard peripheral. That was such a weird time that, wasn't it? Because it was just like, I got so sick of it so quickly because I went to a couple of house parties for Imagine People and they would always have a Guitar Hero Rock Band there and I just wasn't interested, personally.
I'm a big fan of the art of conversation, Matthew, which won't surprise you.
The problem with a Rock Band party as well, is it means the main source of ambient music is going to be rock music played out of a TV, which A, the sound quality is not going to be as good as it if you're just playing out of a sound system. Also, it's rock music that the quality of which can degrade as people get worse and more drunk at the game. And also, it's rock music accompanied by the tap, tap, tap of the buttons, the noise of the fucking rubbery drum pads or the clacking of a keyboard.
It's like, as a piece of performance, I can't... There are a few things I would rather see less than a full group playing rock band.
Yeah, it was like... It's bad enough when it was just a guitar controller. When the rest of it was in there, it was like, all you do is just sit there silently and watch people play it.
It's just like... That might sound like a good idea for a party game in theory, but when you're in an actual party watching it play out, you're like, this is shit, and I stopped going to parties like that, and they were joyless. They were utterly joyless.
Right, so I should probably add this final paragraph from the note. The kids love Lego rock band, and we've all had a great time as a family playing it.
Very, very different vibe to us.
I'm going to let him off. Sounds really nice.
I'm quite moved by that. The thing is, it sounds like the whole family would have to get on the boat, and that's too rough to even consider.
That's really bleak, yeah. I don't want to think about... No, we're not going there.
That's genuinely nice. You know what, though, I will say, I think you should have a copy of The Beatles' rock band. The fact that that's not in there is egregious, so I'm going to insist...
Who's the guy who sent this in?
This is from Chris Bush.
OK, Chris, I'm going to... The sort of security guards on Samuel Roberts' Peninsula are going to mash your head into the belly button of the Resident Evil Village guys. That's like your punishment, basically.
We're just going to mash your head into the belly button for a bit. And then you're free to go back to your kids. But that's what you get for not buying The Beatles' rock band.
So, otherwise, I wish you the best with all your nice happy family times.
Do kids like The Beatles?
Yeah, but do kids like fucking Motley Crue or whatever? We could say about anything. Do kids like Knights of Sidonia, Matthew?
Well, that's why it's Lego Rock Band. Because Lego Rock Band is like... It's all things everyone likes, like Queen and things like that.
Oh, really? I don't really remember the songs in that. Sorry, there's some clicking in the background, which I know you hate now, Matthew, as a result of the Jeremy episode.
But they've got the Ghostbusters theme on there. I can see why that would be quite exciting. They've got Girls For Boys by Good Charlotte.
I definitely like Kids, so I'd be baffled by that now, the concept of Good Charlotte. Yeah, OK, I can see that. Oh, Ruby by the Kaiser Chiefs.
I almost want to reverse my decision based on that. They played that in the pub we were in the other day, Matthew. That song, I've got no time for it.
But we've made the verdict now, so let's move on.
It's safe. We can't mess with their fates that much. Exhibit L from Scott Robertson.
Hello, he says, aggressively waving his hand to dishonorable Judge Roberts. I came to Games Court today to discuss my potentially questionable investment into my JRPG addiction. As a kid, I was lucky that my dad got me a PS1 for my Christmas with my very first JRPG of a little-known game called Final Fantasy VII.
I then played any JRPG I could get my hands on. Many years later, I no longer have my old consoles, and I've been itching for that nostalgia. I now have a gaming PC and Switch, so I created an eBay account and started looking for an American PS2.
It would allow me 60 FPS menus in games like Final Fantasy VII. I finally bought one for £70 with two controllers and an RGB SCART cable and a power converter so I don't break it by plugging it into a UK plug socket, which I thought was a great price. Unfortunately, I had it sitting there for two months as I had no CRTV and no monitor TV to support SCART.
This meant a pricey investment into a Retro Tink 5X Pro, which was £250. So far, I have spent £320 and have not played a single game for over two, three months. So that's part one.
That's just the console. How are we feeling about that?
So there's a Retro Tink, is that why you can plug it in and it looks real good?
Yeah, you plug a SCART in and it allows you to plug it into a monitor TV and it doesn't look like that.
I've had those up many times.
250 quid though.
I'm going to put my decision on that on HULK, so I want to hear the games. I want to hear the whole venture, you know what I mean? Like the entire sweep of what they're going for.
So basically he's bought a load of JRPGs to play and here they are with their prices. Breath of Fire 3, £42.44. Do you have your big Breath of Fire guy?
Don't know much about it. It's like the only Capcom RPG, is that right? Like it's a Capcom published series, right?
I know there was one on... Is it one on PSP? And it was like a series that started on Snares era, I think?
Yeah, it's a tricky one. So I know very little about it and I was just having a little peruse of YouTube at lunch. But if you look up like Breath of Fire 3 reviews, you mostly find like Breath of Fire fan channels and it's all a bit screwy because they obviously think Breath of Fire is like the best thing ever and they've made it like a cornerstone of their whole being.
So I don't know if you can entirely trust them, but it does look pretty jolly. You can tell it's dragons.
I do remember wanting this at the time. I thought it looked kind of pretty and it was a game I coveted but never owned. I can see why this series might be interesting, but let's go and see where we're at.
Final Fantasy VII £23.87 Yeah, sounds about right for a copy of that.
It's always a little bit pricey.
Final Fantasy IX £12.45 That's a good price for old-ass Final Fantasy IX.
Again, I think I bought a new copy of it for about £30, about 10 years ago.
Lunar Silver Star Story Complete, which has got the box and a cloth map game and book for £45. I looked up this little box collection of this and it does look very nice. It's very thick.
It's like a PS1-sized disc, but probably got the depth of maybe three PS1 cases. Very solid-looking thing, packed with interesting treats.
Yeah, that's a series that I don't think ever came here either. That's one of those series that would come out in Japan and the US, and that was it. I've looked up Lunar over the years as a casual JRPG onlooker.
Yeah, interesting.
Okay, we've got Alundra for 58 pounds, 12 pence.
Crikey, that's a lot of money, isn't it?
Yeah, I watched a little video of it at lunch. It looks quite jolly jumping around. It's from the people who made Landstalker.
It's kind of an action RPG, quite a handsome sprite art. A weirdly tall character sprite, which is how I feel about Landstalker as well. An unnervingly tall sprite.
Yeah, I think this visual style has aged very well, actually. I was looking at this a few... People were talking about Alundra during the last Nintendo Direct because they were like, why aren't they remaking this or whatever?
And it's true that it does look very nice in retrospect. I think this era of 2D art has aged quite well. So yeah, that's very pricey.
We were spending a lot of money here. I think we've surpassed the price it would take to get a Steam Deck at this point, which is notable.
So the last RPG is Vagrant Story for 76 quid.
Fuckin hell, that is high. I think I own a copy of Vagrant Story.
Quick, sell it for 76 quid.
Well, I wonder if maybe the NTSC version is what we're talking about here, because obviously the whole venture is Import PS2. I'm taken with how interesting this whole thing is, Matthew. I think that despite the high price, I like the hobbyist angle of all of this.
I'm going to build this JRPG collection, I'm going to play them the way they should be played. It's crossed into my area of interest just enough for me to think this is like, I wouldn't spend it myself, but I can see why it would be worthwhile to someone. They were cool games to hear about.
I think of all the entries so far today, if I could press a button and have one of these little collections for myself, this is probably the one.
It would be Empire of Sin, some Premier Manager games and fucking Turning Point.
I do love Kevin Keegan.
N64 magazine icon, Matthew. That's part of your...
Actually, just on that note, I've noticed that Kevin Keegan is now sitting in the core. He's playing keepy upy with the mean beans.
He's still livid about it.
Mate, they're sentient. Don't do it.
Okay, so that's going to be innocent. I can't send you to Lord Brisby with that kind of taste on display. I'm just like you.
I want that collection of things. That's a juicy old collection.
I think Lord Brisby would respect him as well.
I don't want to talk about what Lord Brisby does or doesn't respect. That's not the business of this course.
I think he'd be like, you're clearly a man of taste. I'm a man of taste. We're going to have an exquisite time.
It's like... Oh, God, that lunar set is very nice as well. The thing is that as well, I'm a big cloth map guy.
I think of a lot more Games Court entries were like, I bought this big box PC game and it was like a boulder's gate and it had the map in it and stuff. I'm very taken with that kind of ephemera and assorted bullshit. So, yeah.
Okay. That's definitely innocent for me, Matthew.
Wonderful. I haven't actually been keeping track of these, but it feels like that.
Yeah.
They feel like they've gone my way.
I think so. Should we do a couple more?
Yeah, let's do a couple more. We've got some short ones. So, very, very quickly.
Exhibit N from Tanner. He doesn't say individual prices, but he bought F-Zero GX and Viewtiful Joe on GameCube for a combined 100 bucks.
So, these are not cheap games to buy. And I think I bought Viewtiful Joe 2 recently on GameCube because it was cheaper than buying the first one. F-Zero is definitely not cheap.
Gosh, I think if you're going to buy... Oh, God, maybe I'm being too generous today, Matthew. Like, I feel like there's not enough spite going on on my side.
This is human hungover. You can see clearly. You're more rational than you've ever been before on Games Court.
Yeah, that's it. What am I doing on this barge? We've got to close this whole thing down and hand ourselves in to the authorities.
This is like... We have to close it down. Yeah, I think if you're going to collect games for any format...
I like collecting for GameCube because you can, you know, you can put them into a Wii, so they're relatively simple. It's relatively simple to get hold of a Wii and play a GameCube game. Also, at the same time, if you're like me, you like to boast about your GameCube official sort of like component cable, which makes the games, to be honest, they still look fucking blurry on a HDTV, but they look less blurry than they would if you plugged them in via SCART.
So that's nice. GameCube games just... I don't know, there's an inherent collectability to them that I don't think the Xbox and the PS2 have from that time.
So I get the urge to hoard them. And these are two very good games. Huge faithful Joe fans, side-scrolling, sort of like French art inspired, but kind of like cell-shaded art style.
Slow down time, speed up time, like watching a comic book played out, obviously like a Hideki Kamiya game, so big favorite for us. One of the Capcom sort of like five, a defining GameCube game. And F-Sero GX, which I have less experience with, but I know is the Negoshi developed sort of like F-Sero game that is absolutely rock hard, but the people adore.
It looks real nice and smooth.
Beautiful, but cruel.
Yeah, like Negoshi himself. Maybe. Yeah, so good picks, I think.
So $100. If it had gone much higher, I would have said bad, but this is basically, you paid around the RRP, which I think is to be expected in this current climate of Nintendo collectability. So there'll be no Lord Brisby for you, Tanner.
Wonderful. So a very quick one, and this is more just to hear your stance on a particular form of game packaging. I just bought the Steelbook, Last of Us 2, second hand from CEX for 15 quid.
You didn't, Matthew Castle.
Seems great, however... Oh, this is from Jamie, sorry. Seems great, however, I've just finished playing Last of Us 2 on a friend's copy and have no plans to play it again for a good few years.
Probably longer if I get the remaster. I'm just interested where you land on Steelbooks.
God, I mean, I think they're a quiet taste. I think some people like them. I sort of find that all I really do is pile them up when I get them.
They're like things I get and then I don't really do anything with them. I get their inherent collectability. I've got the Mario 3D World plus Bowser's Fury one that's just in a pile in shrink wrap and I don't know what I'll do with it.
I don't think I'll ever sell it for money.
I'd just throw it in the Bath River.
I think the authorities would appreciate that, wouldn't they? I don't know. They're not for me.
I'm not really interested. I imagine you feel the same, Matthew.
How do you feel about Lost of Us 2 for 15 quid?
That's a good price. That game has got the old PS5 60 FPS patch. So if you don't want to play it again now, and you want to play it again in the future, you'll have a much improved experience.
So, yeah, I would say 15 quid is a good price for that.
Very nice.
Again, sorry, there's no peril in this episode. People must be really disappointed. They're like, fucking send more people off to the pervert.
And I'm just saying, not doing it.
We're going to do two more. I've got a couple more with a couple of interesting things. And other people will have to wait till the next episode.
We peaked with pubes.
Yeah, that's the problem. I should have kept pubes as the grand finale.
Definitely.
God damn it. Oh, well. That's it, isn't it?
In the case, you always have your sexiest piece of evidence last. You want to leave the jury gasping and shocked so they can't remember the earlier stuff.
This is why true crime documentaries are so annoying. You get all the hot stuff in Act 1 and 2. And then by Act 3, you're like, I don't really care about this because they never solved it.
So whatever.
Not serial though.
Oh yeah, that's true. But then, I don't know, that's depressing as well because it suggests you have to have a massively popular podcast to get your case done properly by the authorities.
That's veering on like, go fund me to get me out of prison.
Yeah, basically. But that's the kind of justice we like on Samuel Roberts Peninsula.
Podcast justice. Exhibit P or the exhibit numbers have gone out the window anyway. This exhibit's from IC Robots.
They bought Shining the Holy Ark on Sega Saturn for 80 quid. I get that this is a lot of money for a 25 year old game, but Saturn games are very expensive these days and Shining the Holy Ark is a great Saturn exclusive that isn't available on modern consoles. It's a first person dungeon crawler that might nearly ties into Shining Force III.
I played this when I was about 11 or 12 and always considered it to be in the same class as the more famous PS1 JRPGs of the era, but I never hear it spoken about in that company. I wanted to replay it to see if it holds up and having started it this week, it absolutely does. It's a fantastic game that deserves more recognition.
Now my question to you is, is IC Robots Ashley Day?
Yeah, the thing is, I imagine that Ash has owned a copy of this for about 10 years. Gosh. So, look it up.
It does look, because it's been at least two weeks since we upset the Sega fans listening to this podcast, Matthew. It does look kind of ugly. But you know, this is a Saturn, so like...
Oh, Ash is going to be on you for this. This is one of the ones, I read his post on Games from the Black Hole on Shining the Holy Ark. Because he just wrote a thing saying how good it was.
So the interesting thing about this, or one of the interesting things about this, for this podcast's interests anyway, is that the team behind this basically split off and become Camelot, who then go and work for Nintendo. And Ash drew this out in his very good piece on it. And I also thought this, watching some video reviews, that there's some precursor to Golden Sun in this.
In its creature system is a little bit like the Gens in Golden Sun. And also its idea of sort of explorable puzzle-filled dungeons isn't miles off from the kind of slightly Zelda-y dungeons of Golden Sun. So, I don't know.
It is a first-person dungeon crawler, which isn't for everyone, I will say.
This core is lenient to JRPGs. As a teenager who got massively into Final Fantasy and then sort of realizing this genre went really far and wide, but not so much in Europe, you know? It was a genre that did not exist in a kind of comparable form until Final Fantasy VII launched, so a lot of these games do miss out on European releases.
This is actually not one of them, though. This did release in 1997. I think that I always coveted these kinds of games, and I think that the first-person element is really interesting.
I kind of get it. I sort of get it. How much was the price again?
80 quid.
That's all right. That's not too bad for a game from this time. You'd expect all Saturn games to just cost a fortune.
I think that's just because Panzer Dragoon Saga costs a fortune.
I think the Saturn boxes are quite sexy as well.
Yeah, that's it. Suddenly lonely. If I had a Saturn, this is totally the kind of game I would buy.
So I'm sympathetic to this. I don't trust Ash on all things, but I'm going to take his word for it on this.
We've got a couple more from this guy. Shenmue 2 on Dreamcast, £6.48.
That's fucking cheap, isn't it?
Sorry, I should finish this off. The copy I bought only includes discs 3 and 4.
That explains it a little bit more, I would say. Keep going.
He bought it knowing it was only 3 and 4, thinking that he might be able to assemble a complete copy by rebuying the remaining discs.
That is what optimism looks like.
Now it's arrived, I realise that it's only half the case as well.
The original version came with discs 1 and 2 in one case, 2 and 3 in another, and then a cardboard sleeve to hold the 2 together. I'm not sure now whether I'm just stuck with half a copy of Shenmue 2, but I do own a digital copy of it, so that probably mitigates it.
Who's got the cardboard sleeve is my question. That's amazing.
One more from him. Football Manager 2007 on the PSP for £3.05.
I was not expecting that last pivot.
That's a big swerve from Shining the Holy Art Shenmue 2 and their natural, the Holy Trinity Football Manager 2007 on PSP.
At least we've ruled out that it's Ash if it's Football Manager. Gosh, the Shenmue thing is, if you'd have bought it and it would have been an empty case, but it would have come in that lovely cardboard sleeve, I've seen it in the flesh copy of Shenmue 2 on Dreamcast, and it was a beautiful looking thing, absolutely gorgeous. The fact that you have just this like pathetic remnant of it, it's like a little bit unforgivable, I think.
And so I got so excited by your first entry here, and then my interest has declined very suddenly, and I'm really upset by that, I'll be honest. Like I thought these were all years ago.
It's a bit like when you're alibi for murderers because you're in another house doing a different murder.
Football managers, that's too cheap for me to be upset at. Although it is a bit weird playing historical football games. I kind of get the appeal of like me, you only understand 90s football or whatever, so you have to dwell on references to like Markovamars because you don't know what anything is these days.
You don't know what Neymar is or whatever.
A little nod from Kevin Keegan there. He's sympathising for it with you.
Yeah, he seems like, oh, yeah, I remember the 90s very good. And then, yeah, so I don't know if I can... I think there's just such reason behind that first pick.
Like, I'm completely taken with it, like reading about it while we're recording this. I'm like, I would totally like to give that a go. And they are right.
They will never salvage... What reason would Sega have to salvage this? This has got to be so far down the list below like...
Do they ever do a Saturn mini?
I guess they could do that. Sega, the Mega Drive they got coming out this year has got some quite weird stuff on it, hasn't it?
It's just got Sega CD stuff as well.
Yeah, but then the Mega Drive was so big, you can guarantee that they would make something like that, whereas the Saturn was never big. So it's much less likely that it will get the same treatment. I'm going to let them off, Matthew.
Look how much we're talking about that first pick. That's made for some good podcasting, I think.
Oh, Lord Crispy's disappointed. He was licking his lips in anticipation when we were doing that Shenmue 2 bit.
I want the first person precursor to Golden Sun, and I will link Ash's article after this episode goes live.
Wonderful. So finally, we're just going to end with some Listo Games exhibit from IMGTR63 on our Discord. Just some purchases from him, no preamble, just so we like it.
Unless you've got a good pubes story, you can include that. So first up, DJ Hero 1 and 2 plus turntable, 15 euros.
Right, yeah. Okay, I hope you bought that in KFC. That would be good.
Yeah, so, you know, DJ Hero, not my sort of thing, but I know that, I don't know, for some people, this was like the game they'd been waiting for.
I thought it was quite cool.
It was quite funny watching games journalists play this. I will say that. Like, my memory isn't...
Yeah, but like legs bunched together, hunched over, and just sort of like little turntable balance on their knees, just going... It was like a very... I don't know, it was not the glamorous vision of like DJing that is presented in like, you know...
It wasn't exactly watching like, Paul Oakenfold at work, you know what I mean? It was a little bit...
Yeah, it wasn't like put on your giant mouse head and go crazy.
15 quid's alright though, and it's not like a massive peripheral either, is it? So it's like, it's not super egregious. So yeah, I get that.
Chronicles of Riddick, Assault on Dark Athena, Xbox 360, for 7 euros.
Yeah, you know, a favourite of mine. I would not allow it in the 7 out of 10 episode because I believe this is an 8 out of 10 firmly. I stand by that.
Some of the best first person melee ever put in a game.
Well, there you go. You heard it here first. Rockstar Table Tennis, Xbox 360, 2 pounds 50.
I mean, I know people really like this, but not to take this out on you, but people who said this was the best Rockstar game were the worst people in the universe. So I kind of want to send you off to Brisbane just for those people.
Rockstar Table Tennis is purest ass. I hate that game.
Well, it's fine, but people who said that were like, is there any baitier take than that? Like, this is better than GTA 4. And you're like, fuck off.
That's rubbish.
Contact on Nintendo DS for 12 euros.
Yeah, I bought this myself and never played it. I just wanted to learn more about Matthew Castle, you know, so why has he got it?
That's the mad thing. This has been my Twitter avatar since day one on Twitter. I'm very proud that I've never changed my Twitter avatar.
Yeah.
Like, that's a badge of honour for me. I think you should get a special ring around your thing if you've never changed your logo. So everyone's like, this person does not chase trends.
They are true to themselves.
Yeah. Were you a big contact guy?
No, not really. It's nearly fine. I only picked it because when I started NGamer, it's my reviews avatar from NGamer.
And they were like, you have to pick a sprite or something for your avatar. And I thought, oh, I'll pick this professor because he looks kind of brainy and bookish. And that'll be my, like, persona in the mag.
But then I was quickly revealed to be an idiot and have an idiot persona in the mag. So, yeah, I've been married to this dumb professor sprite since then. It is an interesting curio, though.
Like, if I saw it on your shelf as part of a DS collection, I'd be like, oh, that's interesting. That's, like, you know, that's not in the, you know, the obvious kind of, you know, top 50 games even.
Yeah, this is firmly in the, like, the category of this will add colour to my DS collection when I bought it. But this and Flower, Sun and Rain, there was a similar intent behind both of them.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd be more impressed if you had Flower, Sun and Rain, because I think that's slightly, like, funnier, more enjoyable thing.
Yeah, I don't know if I'd call it enjoyable, but nonetheless, it's a hero.
Not enjoyable, no, compared to Contact. Finally, Warhammer 40K Space Marine on Xbox 360 for 8 euros.
Well, you know, I love me a bit of Space Marine. It was, you know, one of the, I think it was the first game we discussed in the best 7 out of 10 games episode. There's a good mix here.
I like this combination. Read the list again, just fire through it.
DJ Hero 1 and 2, Chronicles of Riddick, Sort Dark Athena, Rockstar Table Tennis, Contact, Warhammer 40K Space Marine.
What an array of genres there. Like the full spectrum of games at work there, from Warhammer to DJing. Like just, that's, yeah.
And to Vin Diesel, you know what I mean? We've like crossed the, wow, yeah. Just makes you think about the range of amazing interactive experiences out there.
I just wish all the other characters had been unlockable ping pong players in table tennis. Vin Diesel would have made that game electric.
Yeah, that's it. They should make another Rockstar Table Tennis game. You can play as every single Rockstar Games character.
And it is like Cole Phelps playing tennis with like John Marston, that would rule.
The guy from Red Dead Redemption 2 just hacking up blood over the table tennis the whole game.
I'm not going to spoil that, but yeah.
Cuffs a lot.
So yeah, I think that's... I've got to let them go. There's been no peril in this episode.
I feel bad about that, but...
Well, that's all on me.
Well, I want our listeners to just bring more peril in future. Like, I like it when there's like a big risk, a big... You know, the God Hand entry was good.
That was good. The Shining entry was really good. Like, I just like that.
The building intensity is a bit... There's a bit less when it's like, I bought this game for three quid or whatever.
Like, big, bold swings.
I do, yeah. Or a box that's got a load of pubes in it.
This is not an invitation for people to start making up very long stories about how they found something gross in the box, because I'll know it's bullshit.
That is a sad state of affairs, when you've got to warn your listenership not to do that.
Do you know what I mean? Danny Mann, I'm speaking specifically to you. Do not send us an email about finding pubes in a copy of The Sims.
I do not want to hear it.
It's been a little while since we've had a Danny Mann email, actually. Yeah, he lives in Ferrum, he'll never be alright, but I wish him the best. So Matthew, we come to the end of another Games Court.
You have been successful. Congratulations, sir. There's a round of applause in the courtroom.
And then, yeah, the bar just starting to sink. So Samuel Roberts Peninsula must move to its new location. I've taken little Captain Toad out of his little shit barrel and I've just chucked him in the ocean.
I wish him the best, but I'm sure he'll wash up somewhere great. And on his ventures. The Mean Beans are elusive, who knows?
Maybe they found two other beans and turned into a complete set.
They ascended to Mean Bean heaven.
One of my favourite entries in this whole thing was The Shamebue Guy because I think it was like the steady realisation that what I've bought was a piece of shit and like, what was I thinking? I kind of like it when it dawns on the listeners during the purchase that this has gone wrong. That's good.
That's very much what I'm going for with our Patreon.
Yeah, you only realise it when you've heard two hours of interminable bad Star Wars takes that you've wasted £4.50. Very good. So Matthew, we are done.
What is the next episode I've forgotten? I read it out at the start.
It's our chat with our friend from Game Informer, Ninmax, Ben Hanson.
Yep, very, very good. So that's coming this month, Zelda, all that other stuff. So lots of things to look forward to.
patreon.com/backpagepod. If you'd like to unlock additional podcasts, we have, at the time of recording, 12 additional podcasts to just go out and listen to. That's pretty cool.
We've built up a nice little archive now, Matthew. Episode 100 coming up. That's exciting too.
Where can people find you on social media, Matthew?
I am at MrBuzzle underscore pesto.
I'm Samuel W.
Roberts.
We'll be back next week.
