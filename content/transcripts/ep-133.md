Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, have you seen The Flash yet?
I haven't.
Are you going to see The Flash?
I probably will. I've got to see a bit of old Michael Keaton Batman. I can't resist.
They got me good.
Yeah, it's good. I keep reading the promotional interviews for this that Michael Shannon's doing, where he compares his role to that of an action figure, and that he didn't really enjoy making the film that much, and I think that's pretty baller as it goes. But yeah, if you want to see Michael Keaton as a Dark Souls summon in a DC superhero film, then it will sort you right out.
So yeah, a bit of a light film related banter there to kick things off.
Good.
We have a Final Fantasy episode this week, and you have been playing XVI quite a lot in the background. So how's that been treating you?
Yeah, it's been fun. I felt a bit guilty about it, to be honest, because you being a big Final Fantasy head, it's kind of wrong that I get to play it for work related issues. And the whole time I was like, should I even say, should I just lie and say I haven't played it?
But then I'm like, this is the beginning of a Curb Your Enthusiasm style confusion or miscommunication, so let's not do that. I try not to tell white lies to my friends, even if I think it's to spare their feelings.
Well, that's very considerate of you. Thank you, I appreciate that. So yes, we thought it was about time we did a Final Fantasy episode of this podcast, because it's a subject that's close to my heart.
I don't consider myself like a true authority on this series or anything, but I've got a reasonably deep knowledge of it, more broadly. There's a bunch of games in the series that I would consider myself an authority on. In some ways, I think Final Fantasy is best thought of as like a meta series, and each game is kind of its own universe, own set of mechanics, that sort of thing.
There is a fandom that goes around with each game in a way that's very specific to this series versus other series.
Individual meme economy.
Yeah, the FFX meme economy is in great health at the moment, but there is no real FFXII meme economy, because the characters in that one are not as memorable, and the game isn't as strange and funny, so...
There's at least one person in the world who's running around shouting, Bash lives! There'll be a Facebook account called Bash Posting, or something like that.
There'll be, yeah, lots of shit posts and yeah, other dubious content. So yes, Final Fantasy is an interesting one to dig into. So the series starts in the late 80s.
It's created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, who is basically like a first-time game developer who joins this company, Square, because he doesn't think he can get a role at any of the bigger companies, because he's a student at the same time that he's working there. As a result, it takes him years and years to finish his studies at university. I should say, actually, that a major source here is the Edge Final Fantasy piece that Simon Park in covering the making of the entire series.
There are so many good nuggets in that that I don't think were revealed before that piece that I will drop here, so I wanted to cite that as a source up front just so you don't...
A scattering of nuggets.
Just so you don't think I've flown to Square Enix and done all this research myself. I haven't, I'll be honest.
I like that.
So in the wake of the release of Dragon Quest on the NES, they make Final Fantasy this RPG that is quite beautiful-looking for the time. It's got a bit of cinematic intent behind it, like the first menu screen you get. You see a silhouette of the heroes.
It tries to create a little bit of, maybe a little bit more storytelling versus Dragon Quest, but honestly, it's more like a collection of mechanics and a world built from the art of Yoshitaka Amano and the music of Nobui Uematsu. Apologies for my terrible pronunciation here. But basically the series becomes like a big success.
And while the story is that it kind of saved Square Final Fantasy, which is pretty much true. They'd never had a hit before this. It's a snowballing success really.
And it becomes bigger over time. So you have like a second game, which has more experimental class-based mechanics. You have a third game, which pushes the class stuff even further.
And then you get to the fourth game, which is on the SNES. And that's when there's like a major jump in what they can achieve with the characters and the world. Not necessarily the game mechanics.
Final Fantasy XV is not particularly experimental game, but it comes to the Japanese RPG gameplay mechanics. It's pretty straightforward. But what Sakaguchi became kind of obsessed with was the idea of telling a story that could get people excited.
And he, my understanding from the edge piece is that he worked with the editor of Shonen Jump at the time to work out how to tell stories. Because Shonen Jump apparently used to have this video game section every week, this weekly manga anthology. What he would basically do was he would look at Dragon Quest, always getting the spot.
And he went, how do I get Final Fantasy this spot? And literally went to the editor to ask him. And the editor coached him through how you tell a great story that pulls out the characters, makes the characters center stage and things like that.
And so yeah, that means it becomes, story becomes incredibly important at Final Fantasy XV. The art looks tons better. They are always nice looking games, but obviously as the tech becomes more sophisticated, Amano's art, he will produce around like 30 to 40 pieces for the first six games.
His art is very like, it's very dreamy and it's fine art really. There's no other video game art that looks like it. It's such a specific dazzling style, but obviously you do need technology to bring more of that life out of it.
With V, they decide to focus more on gameplay mechanics rather than story, knowing that IV was more about story. And so V is one of the better received games in terms of how it lets you shape your different characters and how you craft those characters and build it around your playing style. VI, however, swings things back around to being more focused on the story.
You have this really rich cast of characters who are all intended to basically be protagonists themselves. And so you can switch perspectives throughout the story and then have each one basically be substantial enough to carry the game on their own. And then it builds this grand ensemble piece.
The story is even more operatic and twisty. And you see the sophistication building over time with how they're telling stories. And it's a much more pronounced part of this series than it is a part of other Japanese RPGs.
And that seems to be part of why it gets under people's skin. But of course, the other key thing here, Matthew, sorry to be rambling on here.
No, no, it's just good.
Is that with every single game, this is a great story that Simon puts in his piece from Sakaguchi that when they would complete a Final Fantasy project, they would basically, as a ritual, the whole team would get together, watch the ending of the game. And then the next day, come in with like, everyone with like a pen and paper, and they start coming up with the universe and the game for the next instalment. So really are starting from scratch every single time.
There's no easy. Yeah, no easy way to do that. And then, okay, just to kind of fast forward to the next few bits then.
Final Fantasy VII comes along. Square makes this bold decision to switch from Nintendo to Sony because they decided they needed a CD-ROM to achieve all of their storytelling ambitions. And so they would have to staff up massively, find people who could actually build 3D graphics for them.
Uematsu was happy because he could finally do like orchestral music. And it was kind of like a one-to-one with the CD-ROM of like what he wanted the music to sound like, what it could sound like. And this also marks the first time that Final Fantasy really cracks the West.
So VII becomes an enormous success on PS1. Obviously Sony puts a massive amount of marketing at budget behind the game. So it becomes like a much bigger deal than it ever was before.
And of course VII is the first one to launch in Europe. This kicks off what is largely described as the golden age of the series. So some people might disagree.
So you have eight and nine after this, developed by different teams. Nine is a Sakaguchi game and eight is a Katase game, I believe, another key figure in the creation of the series. When you get to the PS2 era, you have 10, which very much feels like it's in the mold of I would say seven and eight.
And then you also have 11, the first MMO they do, which I've never played. I was sad I didn't get to play at the time, but now I realize it was just a bit of time sync. And I was already not doing a great job at like college and stuff, but having an MMO would have just completely destroyed me, especially with the Final Fantasy universe.
Oh, he's having a right MMO.
You get to 12, which is arguably the most mechanically sophisticated entry of the whole series, or certainly the more modern games, although I don't know if you could call 2006 modern anymore. Doesn't really feel like it. And then the series enters what some might call a bit of a dark age.
I'm not sure that's entirely true. So you get 13, which launches on PS3 and 360 in 2009, 2010. This is longer waited.
You get the feeling it took them a lot longer than they thought it would to make. It was a really big undertaking. It was more polarised than Final Fantasy had been previously, yet introduces the stagger mechanic, which many subsequent Final Fantasy games seem to be using now, including 16 and seven remakes.
So quite a pivotal entry, I think. That has a few sequels. They launch them at second MMO 14.
It's a complete disaster. So they basically kind of redo development on that MMO and it becomes A Realm Reborn, which is very well received. As arguably, I think it is like by financially the most successful Final Fantasy ever made now.
Many years passed between XIII and XV. So the single player installments. XV comes along, built out of the bones of Versus XIII, a long gestating companion title to FFXIII.
And XV, I think is like, it's pretty well received. It's not a particularly deep RPG, but it does chart a course for the future. It's the first real time combat game they make.
And I think crucially, it feels like Final Fantasy. It sounds like Final Fantasy. It has all of the, I think it has all of the right things in the right place, even if it feels like it didn't reach its full potential.
And we get to XVI, where basically the business unit at Square Enix is behind XIV. Essentially, my speculation is they seem to earn the right to basically make the next single player numbered instalment. You know, it seems like they are, they have a, you know, there's like a good head on the shoulders of Yoshida, the producer of this game and the director of FFXIV at Run Reborn.
So there's a brief potted history there, Matthew. It wasn't that brief really, but you know, crammed it into about eight minutes. Matthew, what is your personal history of Final Fantasy?
Where do you intersect with any of that timeline, if at all?
Mostly from the sidelines being very envious. I was a very happy Nintendo gamer through my teenage years, most of my childhood. But the one thing that I really coveted on PlayStation was Final Fantasy.
And as like an avid reader of Games Master, you know, the most beautiful covers every year would be the Final Fantasy covers, because what they were doing technologically was so far beyond everyone else. You know, you'd see these, at the time, what you would call like photorealistic faces from the FMV sequences, just thinking like, oh wow, like nothing looks like that on N64. And we famously rented a PlayStation and Final Fantasy without a memory card.
I won't go over that again. You can hear me telling that story 15 times across the history of this podcast.
I love you saying famously as well, famously.
Well, famously within the context, the bubble, the echo chamber of this little podcast. You know, like the famous boys across the river. They're not actually famous.
They're not actually boys across the river. We established that one of them drowned and like it's a repressed memory of yours, a very dark memory, Matthew, so.
Sinister stuff. So yeah, it was kind of frustration at once in these scenes, not really having a, I didn't really absorb them by osmosis through friends either because most of my close friends were Nintendo owners. Like we all had N64s at secondary school.
So I don't really remember there being like a big Final Fantasy head in the group. I mean, probably that person for me is my brother Alex, who was really into Final Fantasy. I remember him playing them because we didn't have a PlayStation.
He played them on PC. So he had like Final Fantasy VII and definitely VIII on PC. Weirdly though, for something that I did cover, I never really went back and like filled in those gaps.
I've played like chunks of VII and VIII over the years. I've not finished either professionally. Like the first time I properly encountered it from like having to cover it for work was was Final Fantasy XV on official Xbox, which we went quite heavy on and we did did quite a lot of coverage of.
And I played all that that all the way through and enjoyed it. And actually, I tell you, I had Final Fantasy XVI on my slim PlayStation. In fact, I think I bought it with my PlayStation 2 slim because there was a gorgeous edge cover or edge really went to bat for it and said it was super sophisticated.
So that's what kind of got me on board. So I have played that one. And then I played through 10 with Catherine.
Catherine's a big big into Final Fantasy. I think we started playing through 13 as well, but I think we only made it halfway through halfway through part one of three. I thought that was a very long and boring way of saying I have Apache relationship with Final Fantasy, but I'm super interested in it and its place in the landscape and kind of what it signified throughout the years.
There was a lot of time Final Fantasy meant the cutting edge, particularly in the PlayStation years. They would basically show you the best games could be and maybe that has kind of changed over the years or they've struggled to kind of hold on to that position. But it's been interesting to see them wrestle with that sort of legacy, I guess.
Yeah, what's interesting in reading the history about Squaresoft and the development of the series is how the culture there changes from very much a bunch of students just working together to make things happen to becoming more of a professional company. And it's weird because there's Final Fantasy, the original released in 1987, and Sakaguchi is ousted by the early noughties. And it seems like, and that's obviously due to the failure of Final Fantasy spirits within the film that lost like $90 million or something.
Deservedly so.
Well, yes, probably the amount that like Babylon lost, but it's not like they're chucking Damien Chazelle out of Hollywood, is it? But yeah, so it's interesting because that period of time isn't really that long. That's about as long as I've been working full time, you know?
But like you realize the amount that happened in that time from the recent release of Final Fantasy to, you know, Final Fantasy XV releasing, it covers that entire period of time. So it's, you know, an enormous like enormous evolution of a fast evolution as well for the series. Like people pointed out the gap between FF7 and FF10.
It's four years, but those games don't really look four years apart, you know, at least to most people.
Shepard did the series through one of two very difficult sort of generational leaps. I think the second one is like a little bit more harder to pin down, but it's the natural like evolution of tech and graphics and where we're going that like everyone now seems to be sort of wrestling with. You can spend an infinite amount of money making your game infinitely pretty and like where do you draw the line?
I guess is the question now where maybe that shift has been harder to navigate for the series. But yeah, I'm for, you know, the leap from SNES to PlayStation 1. I mean, it's unreal what they did.
Yeah, absolutely. And then even from PS1 to well, even throughout the PS1 era, the very simple polygonal models of 7 compared to how, you know, Zidane looks in 9. They're just, you know, they you don't have that difference between what the characters look like in battle and what they look like on the world map.
It's all the same, which is, yeah, they just really got to grips with that tech, you know.
I just feel the leap from PS1 to PS2 wasn't quite as scary or difficult as like the leap from PS2 to PS3.
That's definitely true, because HD just seems to bring its own challenges. I also got the impression that the tools they built to make FF13 were maybe quite complicated or expensive or something like that, because they only use them, I think, for those three games. And then they're basically like done after that.
And now I think they're making games in Unreal Engine, I think. Maybe 16 isn't, but I'm pretty sure 7 Remake is. So the other thing that's interesting with Final Fantasy is, so my history is that I had a friend who had FF7.
I remember in the late 90s going around his house and he was in Wall Market and wandering around and I was like, oh, what was that? But at the time I was playing a lot of like RTS games and Star Wars games, so I wasn't totally won over by the idea of playing a Japanese RPG. And then when the PS2 came along though, I was just like fixated on the idea I have to have a PS2.
And so it was like the early days of the PS2 were super cool because it was quite a quiet launch, but there was so much like big stuff about to happen. So GTA 3 about to become 3D, obviously. Gran Turismo 3, which was a huge deal because that was a massive step up in like, you know, how pretty you could make a car look or how close to real life you could make a car look.
And you had things like Metal Gear Solid 2 on the horizon and Final Fantasy XV was one of those two where there were these like mega amazing looking games just around the corner. And I think that that probably sold the PS2 as much as like the idea of having a DVD player did. There's the idea that all these things are about to happen.
Devil May Cry. And so yes. And so 10 was 10 was one of those.
I think I'd seen just a trailer for it. I was like, wow, I have to I have to get an underground floor of that. And I remember buying the issue of Official PlayStation 2 magazine had the demo disc has this really close up image of Yuna's face from the game.
So you have these. She has like a couple of them is it like something chromia we have like two hetero chromia, something like that.
We have two separate David Bowie eyes.
David Bowie eyes. Yes. And so I played that demo.
And despite the shonky voice acting, I was like, I can't believe how beautiful this looks on my tiny TV VHS combi.
I was playing that as well. And that was my only interaction with 10 until I played it with Catherine was like watching him play that OPM demo and just like the opening of the game. Right.
Yeah. You get the opening of the game that it cuts forward to Besaid Island with a few little battles. That's like two bears.
Yeah. Yeah.
It looked pretty amazing.
Tropical World, something like you hadn't seen before, something that only really felt like it existed in video games. It was really, really different visually from what other Final Fantasy games were doing at the time, had been doing previously to that. And that kind of set me off down a path of hovering up the PS1 games, going into like pre-owned shops and picking eight up and seven up and later nine and just investigating the history of this series.
I had a friend who used to live across the road who had bought a Final Fantasy special issue that had an eight demo with it and then a complete history of the series. And I just said, can I have that so I can read about what happened in this series before seven? I became totally fixated on it when I was in my late teens, basically.
The funny thing is, you say that there weren't any Final Fantasy heads and you're all like, oh, little group, right? I didn't really know many at all. I think I knew two people who liked Final Fantasy alongside me at my school.
But it was not like, you know, GTA Vice City. You would not find the same amount of people playing that as they were playing Vice City. It was like, it was, it did always seem to me like it was more niche here than it maybe was in North America, you know, just from anecdotally.
It's tricky because so much of my relationship was through Games Master and a lot of its references were instantly absorbed, particularly Final Fantasy VII. Like there were always jokes about like characters in that game or like, you know, the big dramatic beats of that game. You know, Sephiroth became this like instant sort of shorthand for good villain.
So it felt very present like in my reading material. The people I know who do love these games, like my peers of a similar age, you know, you and some of the people I work with, whenever they talk about your relationship with them, it does sometimes sound like a very like private, intense relationship you had. Like someone who basically like locked themselves in their bedroom, played a hundred hours, remembers it all in this like granular detail, you know, can talk about the dramatic lead up to fighting an ultimate weapon in Final Fantasy XIII or remembers a very specific sound effect or whatever.
It almost because it didn't have like an outlet and it wasn't discussed more openly. It was allowed to kind of seep in on a deeper level in some weird way.
Yeah, I think I get what you mean there. The other weird thing I think about this, I definitely have floated this theory to you before, is I think that to me, it seemed like there wasn't really a mainstream appreciation of anime or manga in the UK prior to around the late 90s when Pokemon launched in the UK. I feel like that, I know there was like, there was sort of a, you know, there were VHSs and like Akira and stuff like that, and there was an underground interest in this stuff.
But I feel like that kind of like wave crashed a bit sooner in the US when people in the mid 90s were watching Dragon Ball Z and stuff. And that didn't happen here, is my understanding. Like the Pokemon was the first time I really noticed this stuff hitting the mainstream.
And, you know, from there it did snowball for sure. But Final Fantasy, weirdly, a series that feels, you know, we talked about the Shonen Jump connection there, which feels like very much like it's inspired by at least like archetypes or different types of stories or, you know, imagery. Final Fantasy VII kind of brings that here before the things that inspired it or helped to inform it actually became mainstream here.
So in some ways, I think that was some people's first connection with this kind of like these kind of character designs or this kind of world and that sort of thing. So I think that may be added to its novelty when it launched here that there wasn't it just wasn't anything else like it that was in that was anywhere close to mainstream. And yet suddenly, the most you know, the most important game on the biggest selling console was this game Final Fantasy VII.
And that that I think is quite interesting kind of like, I guess, like cultural reverse engineering FF7 from that when you didn't have loads to compare it to at the time in the UK. It's quite interesting, I think. But that's only my perception.
People who are older than me might disagree. I know they like super plays to have like an anime section and stuff like that. But I really do get the impression that this was not this was not like widely appreciated at the time in the UK.
Yeah, I mean, there's more there's more of an audience for in the US.
You know, I think the super play in N64, though, like I remember it was like Will Overton's mag persona that he was like the JRPG guy. I mean, he even had the alter ego kind of wizard alter ego who was kind of obsessed with these games. So it was kind of still sort of kind of secluded through that.
It was represented almost as a, yeah, here's that genre that this one weird guy likes.
Yeah. And then the anime coverage was a bit like that too. It was very much like it seemed like it was a direct order VHS for 20 quid kind of like underground thing, you know, the back of a games mag.
There's like enough of a Venn diagram crossover to make it worthwhile including, but it isn't like an eclipse.
No. And then a lot of these games, you know, a lot of Japanese RPGs prior to Final Fantasy VII just simply don't make it here either. It's, you know, it's a genre that is obviously thriving in Japan and, you know, there's there are more of them in the US, but there are very, very few of them in Europe.
It was frustrating being a being a legit fan of like another genre when of another series in this genre when like FF was exploding, you know, like if you were a big shining head like Ash Tay, if this was kind of like, oh man, there's this other thing. This other thing could be just as big if more people played it.
Yeah, I suppose that's a good that's a good question to ask Matthew is why do you think Final Fantasy has persisted as a series and why has it succeeded where the Japanese RPGs have not? I think my theory around this is it's always just looked the part a bit more than some of these other games like it's contemporaries. It's always just had that edge in terms of visuals and maybe, you know, at least maybe music as well.
People might disagree that one was more subjective, but certainly just felt like the, you know, having the change of worlds each time just meant these games can freshly dazzle you each time. And the progression was so quick, even between like four and six, the pixel art, the quality of it. It feels like the amount of people making it swells massively during that SNES era.
And then, yeah, you get to the PS1 days and then suddenly it is like it is cutting edge visually in in that kind of like 3D style. So it sort of defines the look of the Japanese RPG for that generation as well. So I think that's part of it.
It's always been slightly ahead on the visual side and, you know, maybe mechanically as well. But what do you think?
I'd put it down to the sort of simple anthology sort of structure of it that you can jump in anywhere. They work really hard to sort of establish their world and characters as individual games. So, you know, they're just, I don't know, it's the kind of craft that goes into just any any good standalone story.
You know, it's the difference between the cup of breakout fantasy novels that break into the mainstream because they have that clarity, I guess, compared to the masses of tomes that when you go into any bookshop, you're like, well, I'm sure they're good, but I'm never touching those. You know, it's the difference between a Game of Thrones and a, well, any a series I can't name because I just walk past them in the bookshop, which is kind of like the relationship between Final Fantasy and a lot of other JRPGs. I think other JRPGs as well sometimes confuse the fact that because they are mechanically complicated in terms of being like very numbers driven and based on this sort of statistical systems, they can be a little bit more narratively complicated or like have very, very dense lore, super, you know, super confusing kind of setups or endless sequels.
And you have to have played the previous entries in the series. I think Final Fantasy, the ones I've played, are very well judged in that the stories are good, but they're not like so complicated you can't get your head around them in the same way that the mechanics are just satisfying. But they're not like my read isn't that they're the most mechanically sophisticated of JRPGs.
And it just sort of there's just something a bit kind of like the middle ground. But but doing it brilliantly there that kind of makes these things work which paired with the amazing production values just makes that even easier to swallow and enjoy. So I mean when you look at that and like even like Dragon Quest is just Dragon Quest is instantly a little bit like nerdier looking a little bit weirder looking a little bit harder to kind of get into like the difference between a slime and a Final Fantasy hero being the face of their game and a fucking slime being the face of Dragon Quest.
Dragon Quest is just sort of says it all really. It's interesting the sophistication thing is interesting because it really does vary between games so yeah I know that's been super broad but I'm basically going to what I've played like I've never been like oh my god this is really out there and I'm losing myself in a world of statistical possibilities but maybe I've played the wrong ones.
Well no I think the edges do soften a bit over time as well because the second game is has like an activity based progression system where the more you do a certain thing the more you level up in that area which was I get the impression it was quite revolutionary at the time and then three is the first one that brings in like quite a complex job system as well which is a class system and so but then like over time while some of that stuff persists it's like I mean I will say when I had to like play the Final Fantasy XV Final Fantasy XI and XII for review on PSP when I was a staff writer I couldn't get over how hard they were they were so difficult I was just like I'm completely out of my element here and I completely copped to I've got good knowledge of three because I played through basically the entirety of three on DS minus the end boss which I couldn't do but XI and XII I'm not an authority on and I just found them so fucking hard I played each of them for about 15 hours and just found myself making tiny amounts of progress but I think when they as they go and as it grows bigger then They don't necessarily become simpler, but they definitely work harder to teach you how all their different systems work without being too cruel about how they do that. So there's a bit of that that goes on. And as they become more mainstream, XVI has an option for you to play it in story mode, and there's also an action mode as well, which story mode obviously is about letting you get through the battles easily.
Action mode is about letting you play it a bit more as that Devil May Cry infused real-time action experience.
XVI has a real chip on its shoulder, though, about its own genre, I think, in terms of their desire to make it a more accessible, more popular, more mainstream, more widespread game, but at the same time their fear of alienating people who still associate Final Fantasy with turn-based games and the way they wrestle with that by basically having options to negate all the combat challenge, if you should wish, and just enjoy, literally just enjoy the story of the thing. I think it's quite interesting. I feel like there's been a lot of long conversations into the night about what they need to do with Final Fantasy and what it should be, and it's always interesting to see where they land with any individual game.
Yeah, I think what's interesting about this series is that it's not surprising they have an identity crisis about the series every five or six years because the entire series is built around having an identity crisis. If you're going to change the mechanics, the world and the characters every single time, what you're going to have to do every single time is ask yourself, what are the things that remain consistent between these games? And in some ways, that's an unanswerable question because there are obviously the iconography is consistent, the enemies, the enemy types recur over and over again.
Certainly the post-7 pretty boys are always a key part of the mix in these games. That's definitely like in there as well. And if Numa is doing the character designs, buckles, and that's a key part of it.
So, you know, it's, but it's what you keep and what you leave behind is a really difficult thing to answer. And I think it is kind of amazing they've managed to sort of thread that over time. But now, because games are so expensive, it feels like the stakes are even higher than ever when they're doing that, I suppose.
So I'm not too surprised that they've been wrestling with this. Okay, so Matthew, let's talk about Final Fantasy XVI because I've played through the demo. You have played a lot more than just the demo.
The game is out by the time people are listening to this. And you know, it's interesting to hear that you've been giving this a proper go. So I know there's like a work aspect to that a little bit, but how has it been treating you?
Because I don't have this super attachment to past Final Fantasy. I think I can, you know, I haven't got like a huge amount of riding on this being like amazing. So maybe I kind of like approached it with a slightly kind of detached sort of just interest of like, oh, I wonder what they've done next.
I think it's a really good bit of world construction, character development and storytelling. Like I think the actual lore of the thing and the tone of the thing. And it's been said a lot of times, this draws a lot from like Game of Thrones in that it's a bit more grounded, it's a bit more brutal, you know, it's a little bit more, I guess like the sort of, you know, in video game terms like The Witcher, in terms of it's about like warring nations and quite like human problems.
But with this sort of super, you know, the supernatural element of these sort of giant god-like summons that each nation can kind of summon, feels like a bit of a crude sort of nuke analogy, basically that everyone has this technology which lets them kind of compete on the world stage. That I'm all really, I'm really interested in and like how they spend time to kind of flesh that world out and like bed you into it and introduce all the characters. That feels like a huge improvement over Final Fantasy XV where my big problem was I just didn't really understand the fucking story or the world at all.
And you had to sort of absorb this huge mixed media project to have like any kind of foothold in that world. I liked what the game was. I liked the minute to minute what I was doing and I liked the characters a lot.
But I thought the story in XV was like a huge, huge miss. And this feels like whatever else they do, someone has said this has to be super coherent after Final Fantasy XV and they've absolutely done that. They've nailed that.
Like it's a good story, well told. I think my problem with it is that by boiling it down to this Devil May Cry style combat system, we basically realize why people don't make 50 hour Devil May Cry games. Because it's just not enough to sustain you.
And outside of like the big story beats where it's introducing like new enemies and there are mini bosses and the bosses, which are amazing. I actually found like, I didn't find the combat system particularly fit for purpose in terms of like the open world stuff or like the wider area stuff. Like every fight outside of the big battles in the story feels exactly the same.
And it just feels like I am so powerful and this combat system has like nothing to do. Where devil may cry, every fight will challenge you in some way. You know, it never just gives you, or it maybe gives you a couple of gimmies like across 10 hours.
But this is like 30 hours of combat I didn't have to engage with and 20 hours that I did. I love those 20 hours, but those 30 hours are like, it's a bit of a, it's kind of a little bit rough. It's my take.
Yeah, that is interesting. It's sort of, hearing your take on it behind the scenes where you were saying to me like it might be like an edge six. I don't know if you want to keep that in the podcast.
No, like, you know, it's interesting how you sort of, if I was bringing it for edge, I might give it a seven. Like the good stuff in it is really good. And I really liked it.
Like that's, you know, that's the important thing is like when it's doing it right and it's all kicking off, you're like, oh, I actually love a lot of this. You know, like I really like these villains. It's got great villains.
And there's so many of them that you really look forward to bringing them down. And when you fight them, a lot of the boss battles are like these multi-stage things because most of the characters are these dominants and can turn into like gods. You're like, well, I know that at some point this person's probably going to turn into like some massive gods and then the whole fight's going to change.
And they actually really deliver on that promise.
Yeah.
Like when they said Platinum were involved with this, I wouldn't be surprised if they were involved in some of those late phase bits of the boss battles because it does go very god in space, like multiple times throughout.
Right.
Like there's some God of War style, like fighting, you know, your man-sized fighting, a thing that's like the size of a planet or whatever. Like it really delivers that spectacle. It's just the problem is most of the game is fighting goblins, plants or spiders, which are just like mush.
Like they don't, they don't do anything. Basically, if they don't have a stagger bar, and I think the demo which you've played introduces the stagger mechanic.
It does.
If they don't have the stagger bar, you can just button mash, and most things don't have a stagger bar, I guess is my problem.
It's funny because the stagger mechanic, like I say, is from FF13. That's where that started, and both VII Remake and XVI have it now. It's interesting because XIII is so widely, you know, seems to be widely derided by people as like a weak point in the series, and yet it has been quite pivotal in defining the modern mechanics of the series.
But the reason it's a great creation is that it turns. It gives you, you know, peaks in an RPG combat system, so you're not just like mashing the same commands over and over again. There is an element of strategy to it, and there is like a rush moment when you can do more damage, and then they can like do a cool animation where the enemy sort of like collapses, falls down, gives you that window to smash them up.
It gets you pulse racing in a Japanese RPG battle. So it is a great mechanic, I think. So I see your point about why that would make some of the bosses more exciting than the regular enemies.
Also, I think like you sort of hinted this, Matthew, there with the platinum thing, but it's the staging with the bosses, especially the demo that I thought was great. So when that Dragoon guy jumps off of the castle to attack you in the demo right at the start of the game, that ruled, that was amazing and the music goes really hard.
This game has got so many good villain entrances. It's really good at that. That stuff is so polished.
I react so positively to it where you're like, I wish I loved every bit of this game because this stuff is so on my way, I think. Do you know what it actually reminds me of more than anything? It's actually Yakuza.
All right, yeah.
In that, in Yakuza you have base level fights, which are basically nothing. But when you get into the more story missions, that's where you have the boss fight, which will have the wild quit time events. That's where it has Kiryu punching a lion, the stuff that you remember.
And you don't mind it. I guess I have a similar relationship with the minute to minute just plodding around the world fighting the same low level threats. It's kind of like how I feel after 30 hours of a Yakuza game.
I can only go so far with it. There's not enough sophistication in these everyday fights to hold the attention. It's weirdly more like that as a kind of action RPG than it probably is any other game I've played.
Yeah, I can see that. I think it makes a really good first impression, the game. I think, like you say, the story telling is super coherent.
Weirdly, the story is more similar to XV than people have pointed out. It's about these one kingdom as the ally of another betraying one of those kingdoms and then basically trying to wipe out the royal family of that kingdom and then one person escaping and one person enduring and then plotting to bring the whole thing down. That part of it is quite similar to XV.
And then there are other similarities to XV. So a key part of the combat is you can do a teleport charge attack, which is quite similar to what Noctis can do in FF15. Just that whacking triangle to smash towards an enemy and perform a melee attack.
That is a key part of the mix here for sure. It's a much more sophisticated real-time combat system, it feels like to me, than XV had. So it has more depth to it, more progression, more ways it can sort of change.
Does it have any party mechanics in it, Matthew?
No.
Oh, really? That's quite bold because XV did have those.
The characters are all AI controlled, and you don't give them any instruction. The only one you can give any instruction to is Torgal, the dog, who is kind of a piece of shit in combat. He's never once done anything where I've been like, great, that was cool, Torgal.
Thanks, Torgal.
My guy, Torgal.
It is super streamlined, both on that front and also the equipment front. In what I've played so far, it has been an extremely linear progression through like my sword and my armour. I just upgrade to the next thing with too high stats.
There's no kind of like elemental strength or weakness system in this game or anything like that. It's just raw combat power. What customization there is, is like entirely in the icons you have equipped.
They each have like a couple of moves, variations that you can pick, so for each icon that you're kind of allied to, I guess, you can have like two powerful moves from them. And I think they've each got four to pick from. You know, your character build, as it were, is basically three icons, each with two moves.
And from that pool of six moves, you can put together some quite interesting things. Each icon has a power that drastically changes one element of Clive. That teleport is the icon of fire kind of teleport, but you know, another one has a move that like pulls people towards you.
Another one has like a very powerful block if you can time it properly. Another one can sort of stun people with lightning and those moves feel very like Nero's arms in Devil May Cry 5.
Right, right.
Where like you have one of these big things equipped and it has like one big game changing element to it. And a couple of like neat gimmicks on the side is kind of, you know, given that this is Mr. Devil May Cry 5 on the combat system, like that isn't a surprise. And I've definitely gelled with it more as it's gone on and you get more of the icons.
It deals them out quite slowly. There's long stretches between and in the early game that means you just don't have many moves to play with, which is maybe where some of that fatigue comes in. Having seen Catherine play Final Fantasy VII Remake, I just felt like that had extra levels to it that this doesn't have a little bit more engagement, a little bit more to think about with how it dealt with like other members of the party or like being able to give instructions.
Like, I feel like people could have managed this combat system and another layer on top and that just hasn't really manifested.
That's really interesting. Yeah, that's, I suppose like the key thing will be how much you tune into the story and whether that carries you the distance. You know, because it certainly feels like the, it makes such a good impression that demo.
I thought that demo was like a great, a great idea for a bit of marketing because it gives you a save file so you can just keep playing it. It is essentially the whole prologue. It's two plus hours of the game, which is, I don't think I've ever played a demo like that since the 90s.
Yeah.
Basically. It's, yeah. So I feel like the story investment is going to be key here, you know?
Yeah. And I actually think where the demo like leaves you, I think the initial setup of the game, like it's a pretty good one. You feel quite riled up.
You know, you're like, yeah, I want to help this guy get what he wants. I think he's great in it. I think the voice actor behind Clive, I think he's called Ben Starr.
Yeah. He really sells it. And it's like, I haven't heard him in other games.
I don't know if he's done lots of other games, but it's not a voice like I'm particularly familiar with. It has a slightly different flavour to it. He has to sell some quite gnarly stuff and he does a really good job across the board, actually.
The heroes you want them to win, the villains you cannot wait to get them. It succeeds on that basic storytelling level of like, you know, your motivations are super clear and you will want to kind of see it through. For all my kind of problems with it, I haven't quite finished it.
I'm like desperate to finish it. The story doesn't quite go where you think it's going to go as well. The core of it is great, I think.
That's exciting because the thing is, right, you can, I think you can level at Final Fantasy that it doesn't, it often bungles it when it comes to having a coherent story, you know, where you understand what's going on at all times and that things are moving forwards and you understand why they're moving forwards and things like that. And I think Square Enix's localization generally is amazing, but I do agree there's something even more spectacular with this one. It just feels so polished as a script and the cast is just so strong and yeah, it just, yeah.
It's quite funny though, because I don't know if the pool of British video game voice actors is small or whatever, but there's a lot of kind of, oh, I know this voice from somewhere with this game. I don't know if you noticed this, but your dad, the king, is Lucas Grey from Hitman.
Oh, that's where I know that voice. Even looks like Lucas Grey.
The last, however many tens of hours I've been playing has been, I'm constantly like, oh, it's that fucking guy from that game, oh, it's that guy from this, it's this guy from this.
You can probably assume that Square Enix cast a guy who played Lucas Grey, right? So there's probably a bit of that to it. So yeah, that's interesting.
The other thing is as well that I noted about it is that the art direction is a lot more muted than in other Final Fantasy games. I think it's going for maturity in a few different ways. That comes from the very basic kind of like there's a lot of swearing in it and blood and it's very violent, unusually so for Final Fantasy.
It's quite strange to see the iconography of Final Fantasy Summons and things like that amidst having bits of Summon chewed up and ripped up and stuff like that. That's quite strange to see that happening. Just generally there's characters who obviously fuck in this game.
I've seen a couple of scenes where it's pretty horny, and these are games that are normally extremely chaste. But it also extends to the fact that the art direction is like, it doesn't mind having characters who are dressed in quite muted tones. It doesn't mind.
Not everyone has to be wearing bright colors and popping off the screen and looking like they're trying to sell action figures or whatever.
It feels like consistency and making the world feel not necessarily like a Western fantasy thing, but feeling like it can sit alongside something like Game of Thrones and look like it belongs a little bit. It's just really interesting to see them resist some of the obvious hooks that Final Fantasy usually will always pull. And that's quite interesting as a project, I think.
Do you agree with that, that there is an attempt at maturity going on here, that it extends beyond swearing and blood and stuff?
The political makeup of the world is quite confusing in a good way, and the game really revels in it. It introduces a mechanic where there's a character you can go to who basically breaks down what's going on in the world at any given time. A lot of the politics, they're not really what the story's about.
It's more to justify why people are in certain places. But if you care about that and you want to dive into that, the game has a reason. It will say, like, this army pushed into this territory which has driven these people down here which is why this bloke's in this location at the moment and that's why it makes sense that you'd be fighting him here when you might think he belongs here and all this kind of stuff.
And maybe that isn't your cup of tea and you can just ignore that stuff. But I like that there is a sort of answer for everything. It has this footnote system, almost, where you can pause any cutscene and then go into a glossary for everyone who's in that scene.
Active Time Lore, isn't that what it's called?
Yeah, it's dumb but it's fucking great. I absolutely love that. It's just the opposite of what Final Fantasy XV was, where it was like, that game's Active Time Lore is you have to go and buy a film called King's Glaive and watch it.
Even then you won't understand it because it's made by our anime team, which is mostly terrible.
Well, I think that was also just because they rushed XV. XV was like a really quick project to get that done. That's why the game feels half complete, I think.
Whereas this one, this one has had years for them to make it, which I think probably makes a difference to how the story is told.
I remember in XV fighting bosses where I was like, I don't even know who this character is. I don't know why they're opposed to me. It doesn't make any sense.
But I do take your point about the general sort of tone of it. And that's quite bold. I think they have a bit of an out in that, like at any moment, this quite mundane, realistic world can explode into two giant Titans.
Like, if there are action figures, it would be the icons rather than the people, you know, and it has that mode too. But the way it actually slips between them is very sophisticated. Like you're never like, oh, this is silly compared to what else is going on.
And, you know, without going into like what the story is about, I feel like the game is a little bit of a critique of petty human matters versus global devastation.
Right, right.
Which feels like very of our time, you know, it's kind of about we've got like the war level of society and then you've got what can we do as a species and the game is like very invested in that idea. So actually having those two modes sort of suits that really well as well.
I love the idea as well of the summons being the kind of like representatives of kingdoms, like these god-like figures, god-king figures basically. That's a really great way to use summons.
I like the idea that like, because people don't have any control over who these summons sort of awaken. You know, if you are the dominant of one of these things, you're like the dominant into you're basically killed and then someone else becomes it. And it's the idea that having this huge power has like, perhaps elevated some people above where they should be or like, it's put power in the hands of some like really unsavoury people who have this gift.
The whole culture around that is really, really well done actually.
It's sort of, it's also interesting, I think, in that the there's a like a slight rejection of tradition in the I think the pitch of the game is something like the crystals have, you know, decided the future for us long enough or something like that. And that's, you know, the crystals are part of the iconography going back to Final Fantasy like they are the original Final Fantasy. They've always been a part of these games is sort of like, you know, the sort of sending you on your quest or something you're seeking out or something like that.
They are the key iconography. And so there's a little bit of rejection of that going on, I think, as well. So you know, in that, obviously, if you think about how the game is, is completely real time and you know, you don't have party control and stuff like that, it's yeah, there's maybe a slight bit of that running through it as well of like, this is not meant to be the same thing you've played before.
It's not living in a march to it. It's trying to forge its own path. So yeah, excited to play it in full, Matthew.
I was yeah, I was really impressed by the demo and yes, sad to hear that the combat system doesn't necessarily hold up against normal enemies. I can see that happening based on what I've read, but yeah, it holds up.
It's just not, it's not made for low level mobs from the meat of the game, which is what it is.
So yeah, it's built for one to one battles, isn't it?
Yeah, well that's it. And those are great.
Love them, you know, but yeah, yeah, just like how you use dodges and how you use your different abilities and things like that. But I will say that based on what I've played, having, you know, followed Square Enix's journey of making real time games from Kingdom Hearts through to FF15, they've gotten better at it over the years.
Yeah.
But it's nice to see them actually get to the point where the combat is almost best in class sometimes, you know, even if it is just in those one to one encounters. So yeah, pleased to at least see they got there just because it seemed like for so long, no one could really agree that Kingdom Hearts was a great action game. No one really seemed to believe it, even though it did steadily get better as they went and that sort of thing.
So yes. Okay then, Matthew. So this is like the one kind of question I wanted to ask you.
I guess like an existential question about the series before we get to the list. So do you think Final Fantasy needs to be a real time action game or an open world game in order to maintain or grow its popularity these days? I asked this because I think if there's one series that can get away with being turn-based still on a kind of like blockbuster level, Final Fantasy is the one that will sell anyway and it's not necessarily a big deal but I feel like they've maybe talked themselves into the idea that they have to have modern game mechanics in there like real-time combat in order to avoid seeming a bit fuddy-duddy-ish but I don't know.
Because we live in a world where Fire Emblem is really big and XCOM is really big, I don't think turn-based is correct to consider turn-based like an outdated mechanic. I think it is there to be refreshed like any other kind of gameplay mechanic. But I was curious what you made of this side of things.
When XVI is at its real-time peak, I can see what an asset it is for them to sell to the general masses because you can put these quite astonishing looking things in the trailers. You're doing it. It's just a better sell than like, this is just a cutscene.
But I don't know, I just think the story and world and characters trumple. I think if those things are good enough, people will play it, and they are good enough, you know. I don't know that there are many people who are like, I love Final Fantasy specifically because of what it is mechanically.
I think my personal theory is there's always been a little bit of, I will put up with whatever it wants to do mechanically because I want to listen to this cool story. Maybe that's unfair, maybe that's wrong.
I don't know. No, I think that's accurate. I think there is a willingness to go along.
I think you're right in that. There's so many people doing cool things in turn-based space. I just think of how beloved Persona is and just the huge buzz around that game.
I don't know. It's still relatively niche in the grand scheme of things, but it doesn't have to be old fashioned. I think there are ways of elevating that, you know, the design challenge is taking those systems and trying to electrify in some way.
I think XIII actually is a really interesting case study of that, of like, like you say, they built in this big mechanic, which puts this very kind of adrenaline pumping kind of peak throughout battle and that is a, that is a deliberate and smart attempt to try and like drag a slightly more arcane feeling system into the modern day and I, you know, I would love to see people with this kind of budget continue to do those experiments. What I do know is that the further it shifts into just real time action, it does run the risk of losing some of the complexity that I think people do demand of these games. I, you know, I already think Final Fantasy VII Remake is a better balance of real time action and slightly deeper systems.
Maybe they have actually already hit the sweet spot in Final Fantasy VII Remake, I guess is what I'm saying.
Yeah, I think that's probably true. Like the, it's got like the ATB bars or whatever and then it's also got, you know, what might be fair to say is Final Fantasy XVI level party, you know, control, even though you're not doing obviously the same complex programming, but it's real time with pause.
So it looks and you can still put, put like the light, the real time combat in a trailer and it looks exciting, like the exciting fights and the cinematic fights in Final Fantasy VII Remake, I'd say look as good as the ones in XVI. XVI is a much simpler game in order to get there.
Yeah, absolutely. But I think Persona is a really good point, actually, because that is, that is a pure trad turn-based system.
Yeah, I mean, it's really nerdy. Like you said, monster breeding is like confusing.
Yeah, it's proper old school and you might not understand how all of the systems work while completing the game. That's the kind of game it is. So yeah, it's, you know, but, but, you know, because they have such like cool sort of UI and fonts and stuff, it just, it seems contemporary and it's the presentation is contemporary.
So yeah, yeah. It's interesting because I sort of believe that too. I think like they don't need to make them real time action games, but maybe the success of stuff like Horizon has convinced them they do a little bit.
I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, that is like, it is the genre of the moment and people kind of pursue it. And there is this idea that if you don't have a big, gorgeous open world or open world looking game on your books, that maybe you're not satisfying a part of the audience, but, you know.
But I hate them now. I don't want to play any more of them.
Yeah, this isn't that. Like, this isn't a… It has field areas that are a bit more open, but it's…
It's not an open world game by any stretch of the imagination.
Yeah, an open world game is a threat to me now. It's not a promise. It's like a threat of a large space that will take 50 hours to complete or whatever.
So with about 80 hours of optional activities, very few of which are good. So there's a bit of that to it as well. All right.
One of the last things I want to ask you, Matthew, before we get to the list is what's your favourite Final Fantasy game? Is this even worth asking you, Matthew? Do you have a good answer to this one?
Whether I've played or not.
You've got good thoughts in this series. You keep talking yourself out of it, but everything you've said so far is on point, I think.
The bit I've played of Final Fantasy VII is amazing. Like I love that city thing. I love the story that unfolds there and the way that clouds buffeted between all these different groups and meets all these weird people.
So much weird stuff happens in six, seven hours, a really great dense bit of storytelling. But obviously I haven't played the whole thing, so I haven't gone back to it. I do really like the tone of XII and I do like the systems of XII.
I can't remember the name of all the characters, which is probably a problem. And the story hasn't stuck with me, but the look of that thing and the tone of it is so distinct. Quite a kind of grown up take on Final Fantasy of the ones I've played probably that.
Tentatively XII. Yeah, okay.
I think XII is sort of like a respectable pick for someone who wants to seem like they, the game design side of the series is the thing that they value the most.
It's a classic Edge IX, XII.
Did it get an Edge IX? I don't know. I think it did.
Yeah. I remember X got an Edge VI. In fact, that was one of my first encounters with the Edge, what an Edge score could be versus other outlets.
Were you like, bullshit? I was like, a VI? I just remember reading it and being like, wow, they just really did not click with this.
You're tired to start laughing in the face of Edge magazine.
That was right around the time I started reading Edge and it was a proper sort of like wake up call of, oh, this is how they review games or this is how they see games. But also, even at the time, the voice acting seemed quite dubious in X. It was never, you know, I had friends who watched me play X and they were kind of like, this is the game you like?
There was a little bit of that too, to some people watching the cut scenes. Just because a lot of the kids I hung out with from the ages of like 13 to 16 were all they played was like PES and GTA and they didn't really play anything else.
You're like, Blitzball's a bit like PES.
Well no, but I literally was saying that kind of thing because I'm just, I was such a like lame motherfucker basically.
So you were always trying to turn the conversation back to Final Fantasy XV, like when they took them out of football players you start dropping the name of Blitzball players and you're like, oh sorry, you probably wouldn't know them, they're from Blitzball, not football.
Yeah Rivaldo's no brother, do you know what I mean? I just think some of these Guado players are really better than Barcelona, you know, like that sort of thing. No, it was one of those things though where actually Final Fantasy was quite a key fork in the road for me of understanding a bit more about what I found culturally interesting and they would say to me, why are you not interested in seeing bad boys too?
And I was like, I don't know, because I like playing this lame sort of Japanese nerd shit, that's what I do.
Because I'm friends with the OG bad boy, Waka.
But there was like this weird split that occurred and then when I got to college I just wasn't really friends with those guys anymore because I realised we didn't really have anything in common. I just, being at the time just like this sort of awful snob that I was, just thought well they're really boring because all they like is fucking football and talking about going to Ibiza and I thought, why don't you just fucking jump off a bridge, that's the lamest shit ever, who cares, but obviously years later I'm a bit more holistic about people's interests so I can click with people who don't have the same interests as me. So I feel a bit differently about it but they were totally like not prepared to engage whatsoever and I realised, okay, I have to go and find people I have more things in common with, you know what I mean?
Did Andrew stick with Final Fantasy Beyond VII?
Yeah he did. He's like, I think he did play through, so he played, he had eight, nine, he didn't play ten, I don't think, but he obviously, he watched me play a bit of ten, he did get into it a little bit with me.
Did you call his heroes Andrew in all of them?
I think you could only, I don't think he called Squall Andrew, I don't think so.
I would love that. All the Andrews.
I think Squall was the only character you could name in, in that game as well, maybe. So yeah, that was, that might not be true actually, but either way, yeah, I think that was more of a, because he was like nine when he played seven, that's why Barrett was called Daniel, named after Daniel Ball, this very timid child that we went to school with, who was the opposite of Barrett's. Timid little boy.
So that was like a, that's quite a key thing for me in terms of understanding, oh, okay, as you get older, there are things that you might be invested in. Like when you're kids, you're just sort of friends with kids because you went to the same school and you kind of get along. And then when you're an adult, you want to develop connections with people who actually have interests the same as you and who can engage with you on things.
I think that's, that's kind of true and Final Fantasy was a key part of that for me. But also, I don't want to sound like an unbearable motherfucker who expects all my friends to like Final Fantasy because they definitely don't. But I even noticed, I don't know if you had this in the future, Matthew, but imagine no one really seemed to care about Final Fantasy except for me.
In fact, I kind of became the guy who whenever there was a six out of ten Crystal Chronicles game to review on DS or Wii, they came to me with it on Games TM and were like, do you want to review this and give it a five or whatever? So I became that guy a little bit. Was there more of a fandom for it at a future?
Because it seemed like generationally no one really cared, I imagine.
Not really. I feel like the generation who were into Final Fantasy were like just before us, so it was like all the people on Games Master during the golden years and most of them had moved on or ascended to be publishers or other boring jobs by then. Yeah, there wasn't much.
In our office, I think our version of you was probably Kim Richards, our version of you, who was on official PlayStation 2 mag and then maybe the PSP mag, but she would get some great opportunities. She was good pals and she was always going to like, I've just been on this press trip and I interviewed Katase about this thing or that thing or whatever and yeah, she like absorbed all the Final Fantasy work. There was a flurry of interest around XIII, but I think it was a bit of a bad hang and the narrative against that game just turned so quickly that I don't think anyone cared enough to fight the kind of prevailing, we don't like Final Fantasy XIII.
Yeah, because that's the other key thing that happens as well is how big Oblivion and Mass Effect become in that generation. Sort of seems to blot out XIII, I guess, kind of relevant to our 360 draft discussion recently.
I was slightly surprised coming to these games a bit later that when I played XIII, the big thing against XIII was everyone was like, it's a corridor for 25 hours. And actually the thing that amazed me the most was when I played Final Fantasy XV, I was like, this is also a corridor. This isn't a world.
How did that… I don't understand how that Final Fantasy XIII criticism took root when Final Fantasy XV is the way it is and is celebrated. I don't get it.
I know why. I can tell you why. So it had towns.
That's the difference. Whereas XIII…
But that's towns along the line.
Well, no, but I'm agreeing with you. I think they are very similar and I don't think the series has never been… until XV, they did open world.
They got one good open world and they ran out of time or money to do the second open world. So they kind of zip you through it even though people got out, managed to use a glitch to go and explore this entire continent they'd obviously built for it and didn't have time to finish. A world map in like from 1 to 9, they are not open worlds, they are menu screens basically with random battles.
But they can create the impression in your head that the world is bigger than it actually is whereas XIII doesn't try and do that, XIII is like you will just walk through the world as it is and you also don't have the option to kind of go back to places as much as you did in X and in X you can sort of freely wander back and forth and you get the airship and stuff. XIII doesn't really have that as much so I think that's the difference but I do agree with you. It was weird that that became the prevailing narrative.
It's like yeah, welcome to Final Fantasy. It's a fundamentally linear game that sometimes lets you kind of walk off into a slightly different cave on a map and that's basically all that really happens.
I mean XIII just abysmal characters. That's his problem.
I suppose that is true, I don't think all of them are that bad.
But there's enough bad hangs because the way it splits the cast up and then you're forced to spend time with certain characters at certain points is like, it's quite hard to get through.
Yeah, I kind of get it. I think the other problem it has is that it takes so long to educate you on how its combat system works that by the time it's taken the training wheels off and given you full control of your different classes and how you interlock them and that sort of stuff in your little pre-made sets of classes, you're already about 20 to 30 hours deep into the game.
I'm used to that in Xenoblade, so maybe I'm a bit more forgiving of that. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is really bad for that as well, it's like a 20 hour tutorial.
But then I just sort of ask, what did anyone have better to do in 2010, do you know what I mean? You can sit through fucking 20 hours of tutorials, it's fine.
I like the music as well.
Also I think that's the key thing about XIII is I think it has the vibes of the Golden Age Final Fantasies, like it sounds and feels like it and looks like it. It looks like it fits with 7, 8, 10 to me, you know? It just has that sort of like proto sci-fi contemporary style.
Unbelievably good looking environmental design, just the world design and how it all looked. I know you're not interacting with any of it because you're on this fixed path, but if you're one of those freaks, you're just like spinning the camera slowly 360 degrees and drinking it in. That's good for that.
Absolutely. Absolutely, absolutely amazing combat music as well in that world where the basic battle theme is fucking unbelievable.
Isn't it that?
Yeah, exactly. How can you give a game with that battle theme any less than 8 out of 10, I ask you. That's my answer.
Banger of a Leona Lewis track.
Oh, that was okay. Okay, you have to mark it down two points to that. It's gone down to six.
That's it now. So I have forgotten about that. Oh, what a poor choice.
What a terrible choice that was and how badly that's dated. Can you name a Leona Lewis song for the past 10 years, Matthew? I just…
A theme from Final Fantasy…
Okay, good. Very last question that Matthew will get to list. So what do you want to see from the future of the series?
Well, A, that there is a future. I'm quite invested in there being mainline Final Fantasy entries and then not just going, fuck it, let's not do it.
Agreed.
I wouldn't mind them going back and trying to do something truly daring with more of a turn-based system again. I feel like I'd play enough action games elsewhere that are fine, that I don't necessarily need that from Final Fantasy. I think XVI is going to leave a generally nice taste in the mouth for most people, I think.
I think it's going to be easier to get behind than XV was, for example, and maybe we should just relish that time of peace.
Yeah, I think so. My biggest fallout with the listener recently is when someone logged on the RPG's chat and said that XV was complete dogshit and I was like, mate, you are in the wrong fucking Discord. There's a bit of that going on.
Yeah, so I think that XV was really flawed and yeah, I'm pleased that XVI kind of corrects that. The thing that XV did really well though is obviously the interaction between the different party members and I think that I would like to see another numbered Final Fantasy build on that. It would be nice to have a sort of an expansive party again, like nine kind of characters you could choose from or something like that.
So finding ways to encourage you to mix those up. I think that the major strength of sort of like Golden Age Bioware games right up to Inquisition is just, especially Inquisition when you're wandering around the open worlds and you hear the different characters, two characters who you've never had in your party before interacting and understanding their relationship through the quips and stuff. I think that Final Fantasy could stand to do some more of that.
I guess my really hot take is that I think Xenoblade Chronicles kind of could be a Final Fantasy game if they wanted to call it that. I think it has a lot of the same qualities. I think that is a series which has balanced the desire to make something a bit more open with the kind of nerdiness of JRPG.
I actually think that its combat system is a really good balance of those two things. An even shinier version of a Xenoblade game, a bit more self-contained could be a thing I would enjoy.
What about something persona-y where it's more about character relationships and being sort of horny for different party members or wanting someone to be your best friend?
Maybe persona but with grown-up characters.
That is the other thing I wonder if there's a breakthrough with XVI where they're like oh actually we don't just have to tell these chaste teenage stories, we can actually push this a bit further subject matter-wise because I think they risk being left behind a little bit by what they can, what Atlus are doing if they're not able to do that. So I'm pleased to see them stepping up a bit on that. My wish is I would love to see them make that 2.5 HD style a new Final Fantasy in that mold.
That would be cool. Or maybe even doing like 6 or 4 or 5 with that style might be cool even though they've done the nice pixel remasters, those are pretty cool on Switch. That sort of thing might be good.
The other thing is I would love to see a version of that for a game that has the aesthetic of the PS1 game, so 3D models on pre-rendered backgrounds. I'd love to see an original Final Fantasy that looks like that, that deliberately sells you on that nostalgia. I think that could work really well and it would theoretically cost them a lot less to make than a 16 does.
That's something I think they could probably do more with. So yeah, that's it. Because they're always making so many of these, they can kind of make them on parallel tracks essentially.
But it's hard to tell what the future looks like because they're so long between the numbered entries now, it's eight, sorry, seven years between these two. It's just, it's so long. It used to be one or two years and now it's like GTA level weights basically.
So yeah, who knows, Matthew. Should we take a quick break and come back with top five Final Fantasy games, Matthew?
Welcome back to the podcast. So in this section, I'm going to read out my top five favorite Final Fantasy games, and Matthew can sort of quiz me along the way, I guess. So some caveats here then.
So I want to kind of like layout what my expertise is here. I don't, like I said, I don't know all of these games as well as some of the others. So one and two, I know moderately well.
Three, I know very well. Four, I know very well. Five, I don't really know at all, which might be controversial because I think, like I say, people do like how malleable the characters are in that one.
Six, I know really well. Seven, eight, nine. Seven and eight, I know almost everything about.
Nine, I've only ever really got about a third of the way through that one, so I do apologize because that's a much loved series, but I've always struggled with the pacing of that one a little bit. 10, I love, and 11, I don't know. 12, I know very well.
13, I know very well. And 15, I know very well. The MMOs, I'm afraid, I'm completely out on.
So 14 is like the main thrust of your interest in Final Fantasy. This can be a very unsatisfying section. So with the caveats out of the way, Matthew, I thought I'd talk about the top five and why I've picked these then.
So I wanted to give a selection of like an overview of what I think is great about the series and pick different types of game in assembling the top five to represent those sort of eras or specialties of the series. So I'm trying to like pick variety here as well as picking what I think is like the, you know, the cast iron top five because it really, it's incredibly subjective what people consider the best and what they value because there is that thing where some people are invested in the world and some people invest in the gameplay mechanics. And for me, it's about both of those things hand in hand, I would say, you know?
So that's what's determined this list then. So, okay, to kick off then Matthew, I've put Final Fantasy XVI at number five here. I picked this one because I've been playing the pixel remaster of this the past week.
And I think that the characterisation and writing is really strong. It's one of the best stories in the series, but it's just, it's really richly drawn. And I think for most people who are curious about the past of the series, this is the one where the art and sound will dazzle you the most, where it will feel the most like modern Final Fantasy from like how rich the storytelling is.
And even though the combat system is not like, it's not particularly hard to get your head around, but the world, the steampunky world is very easy to get drawn into. It's so beautifully rendered. Much like Chrono Trigger from around the same time, it just shows the SNES's capabilities at their strongest.
Yeah, just a really easy one to recommend to people now. And yeah, it just holds up really well and has like a great villain and some really like dark twists in it. And it just showed that kind of everything that Final Fantasy did well, firing on all cylinders.
And even though this wasn't the one that was the breakout hit in the West, it did do a lot to further its reputation in North America. And it could plausibly have been a big hit in the UK if they'd bothered to even release it here. So yes, Final Fantasy XVI is first up.
Matthew, have you played this one?
Yeah, huge, huge blind spot for me. And it's one which I know is just an absolute classic of the form, plus worked on by Mr. Xenoblade, Mr. Takashi. So I should play it for my Xenoblade fandom, if not my Final Fantasy fandom.
I know that there's some mechs in it.
There are, there's some called Mode 7 shit in it as well. Just like, you know, sort of semi 3D effects in it. So yeah, it makes the most of what everything the SNES can do.
And the music is absolutely extraordinary. And yes, it's got a few famous scenes in it. It's the first, it's four, four is like the first one to properly crack the template of what the series would become and how the story would drive the whole thing.
But six is the one that I think probably perfects that template and sets them up nicely for what's to come. So yeah, that's the one I've decided to put here to represent, I guess, Final Fantasy's past, Matthew.
I will go and buy this, the pixel remaster of it then.
Yeah, it's nice because you do switch the font though from the default font to the pixel font they've done for it because the default font is not very handsome, but the redo-
It's Comic Sans.
Well, it's borderline that bad to be honest.
Oh, right, shit.
It's just very unsightly and modern. And just the contrast kind of spores it a little bit. And I think these games do need a general touch.
It's why I always thought the DS version of Chrono Trigger was so good because the font for it was so well judged. It was kind of pixely. So yeah, six is first up.
And yeah, it does look nice in that collection. Plus you can whack a bunch of things on to make it simpler, speed up battles, that sort of stuff. So yeah, good way to play that.
Number four then, Matthew, I've put Final Fantasy XVI. Sort of punished this a little bit by, I guess, like my criticism of the story. It had been quite a dry story, well localized and well voice acted and things like that.
But Vaan being the main character, the Bolthea was the most charismatic figure in there. This Han Solo-esque kind of like sky pirate guy, except instead of Chewbacca, they've got like an attractive bunny lady wearing very few clothes, which is a very Final Fantasy move. Quite weird actually that like, that's such a horny character design in the game that it's not really that horny at all.
It's actually quite, the character designs are quite, quite muted compared to a lot of the other Final Fantasy games, so yeah.
This is like closer to XVI in tone than any of the other ones I've played.
Yeah, that totally makes sense. And it has like the whole kind of like empires at war and betrayal of like a royal family thing, right? That's also, I guess like, I guess that's quite a big theme throughout Final Fantasy, but that's sort of the starting point here.
So yeah, I can certainly see the connection there. Has a kind of gambit system, which allows you to program all of these elaborate, you know, sort of commands for characters so that the party can essentially work, function like clockwork based on what you've unlocked. So you can be like, heal this character when they're under 70% health, use this spell when this character's got 100% health, and then you can just set all of these different parameters and then the party will just do the battle for you.
So it really rewards customization and strategy more than any other Final Fantasy game, Matthew.
RPG party meets factorio. It's just a pure automation efficiency. It's amazing.
Absolutely, and it's for a PS2 game as well. That's some quite complex data you're inputting there. The game's just sort of like getting on with it, no problem.
Plus, I think as well, for a PS2 game, this is definitely one of the 10 best looking games for the system.
Was Matsuno involved in this?
Yeah, he was. And I think he left the project partly for real or something like that.
It has a bit of a murky backstory, this one, right?
It does. This is the one that I think we asked Simon about it. This is the one that they couldn't quite crack for that Final Fantasy feature and edge.
It feels like there's a missing chapter in the making of this game a little bit, yeah. But the end result is still really impressive. I think that when they put it onto PS4 and allowed you to speed up the combat, just adding all of these time parameters to make it super fast, it became an even slicker, nicer experience.
So it's great. It's a nice way to play that. They even redid the progression system, the Zodiac board thing that you could mess around with.
They completely expanded that and made it and improved it. So they really did improve the game for that entry. It has an art style where the character faces are not quite so precise or angular that they would look bad blown up.
Instead, they have this quite painterly style to them. So it's dated really well.
So it's a little bit like Vagrant Story.
Yeah, absolutely. Another of Matsuno's games, right? So that completely tracks.
Also, Akihiko Yoshida, a key artist in Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, and then Final Fantasy XVI, and then would also work on Nier Automata, did the main character design for that. Obviously, an incredibly talented artist, but also completely different to what Nomura was bringing to the series. That's the thing about XII, if you see Nomura who joins the series from 4 and starts doing the character designs from 6, and then mostly in 7 onwards, that comes to define what the modern Final Fantasy look is.
But then it's cool that Square Enix has never taught themselves out of taking on other art styles too, and XII's art style is quite mature and different, and it gives it a completely different sense of tone.
You saying the names there of the artist or not, it just reminded me of something quite funny actually. When we got the Final Fantasy XVI code, you get a reviewer's guide with it, and there's a big bit in it where it lists all the key creators on the game and what else they've been in, because they're really leaning on that heavily with XVI. So they're like the producer made Final Fantasy XV, and the combat is this guy who did Devil May Cry 5, and so it says their name and then it says the game underneath them in this very delicate font and then on the composer, it said Masayoshi Soken, and then underneath it, it said Mario Hoops 3 on 3.
It's like, oh, the Mario basketball guy.
Tell you what though, music is fucking rad in XVI. The combat music is fantastic. And then the theme that plays when the two summons are fighting at the end of that demo is just amazing.
It's got that like operatic thing that kind of XV lent into as well where when the summons turn up, it feels like, okay, it's big boy time now, it's all kicking off kind of thing. So right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, he's good.
That's good. Yeah. I know you're a big Mario 3v3 hoops guy, Matthew.
So that was a big win for you.
He did all Final Fantasy XIV too, which I know is like absolutely beloved for his music.
But they needed to put two games in there. So that's it.
It's just that I wouldn't have put Mario basketball in there.
It's an interesting marketing choice that because I think there is, I think they're very like, it's very opaque how Square Enix actually works, I would say. Like how the business units break down, who gets to make a mainstream Final Fantasy entry is a really, I don't know how that happens, how that gets determined. Whether it's pitched for, whether it's given to them, whether it's earned, that sort of thing.
That process is completely opaque. So it is interesting that when they lead into these kind of like creators, because the community is very aware of who the developers are. So they are kind of almost dialing up the myth of them a little bit by being like, these are the games they made.
And you can start to draw conclusions about how that's informed what this game looks like. So yeah, yeah. Okay, good.
So yeah, that's FFXII. I think it's, I think I would, you know, I would fairly agree that it's the most mechanically sophisticated entry in the entire series. It's, you know, or at least like the more modern games.
And so that's my concession to the gameplay mechanics side of Final Fantasy XV. This is the story. I don't really care about this game as well localized as it is and beautifully presented as the world is.
But mechanics, you know, tip-top. So Bosch lives. Okay, number three, my beloved Final Fantasy XIII.
This is a game that's got a proper sort of like cult fandom around it. I think it because it followed VII, which VII was obviously the biggest game in the series and I had the most cultural impact. VIII reviewed really well, but it has such a kind of complex and wacky story and anime-ish story that it's, it's quite out there.
Like this, there's an element in the story where essentially they are these mercenaries who are at this mercenary school, which is extremely anime, obviously, and their kind of like goal is to take down this sorceress, basically. But it then turns into this like this battle over time where time itself is going to be compressed by this sorceress in the future. And then it turns out all the main characters know each other and have amnesia and it's like it's a bit all over the place.
But I think when you're a teenager playing this, like the vibes of it, it's what it's just like hanging out with a group of teenagers. It captures that really, really well, I think. Just one of them is grumpy, one of them is really cheerful.
Everyone's emotions are a bit exaggerated. But it does really feel like taking a journey with a bunch of like teenage pals.
Which character are you most like?
I'm quite grumpy like Squall, but I'm simply not that good looking. So I feel like it would be egregious to compare myself to him. Like looks-wise, I'm probably that.
There's that guy, there's like Kiros and Ward, Laguna's pals. I'm probably Ward, the guy who's got like the big sort of like harpoon thing, who is like a bit overweight. That's like my look, but personality-wise, I guess I'm probably more like Squall.
Your routine is from Ward to Squall though. That's what you said when you went to Pure Gym. You were like, I'm a Ward, but I want to be a Squall.
And they were like, get on that running machine dweeb.
Yeah, well yeah, I hope you're happy to spend three hours a day here and stop eating Wotsits, you motherfucker. Yeah, so, whereas like my little brother is like Pure Zell. Whenever I played that game, I'm just like, Zell is my little brother, just like cheerful and a bit in your face too much and all this stuff.
Right.
Yeah, that's, yeah. So they do kind of feel like, they do sort of feel like real characters with the exception of maybe Irvine Kinneas, the like guy who wears a cowboy hat. I never knew anyone who was a bit like him really, so that's a bit different.
And so, yeah, I think storytelling wise it's fair to say this is all over the place, but the world is really cool because it's kind of like the, it was like the contemporary our world sort of take on Final Fantasy. You'd go to Delling City and it's just Paris and there's other places you go to and there feels like, it feels semi-futuristic, but not massively so. And so I think that worked really well and you just like drive a little car across the map and stuff and it feels like, oh yeah, this is like, you know, if you're making a Final Fantasy set in the real world, this is pretty close to it.
It also has like loads of cool secrets in it as well. Like I mentioned before in the, I think it was in the Best Boss Battles episode that once you get the airship in this, which is actually a spaceship, the Ragnarok, you can land on this like deep sea facility in the middle of the ocean and that's how you get Bahamut. But it's also, if you go further down, you fight Ultima Weapon there and it's a quite spooky thing to uncover.
There's like the card game, of course, Triple Triad, which is much beloved and yeah, there's a lot going on in this game and I can see why it's got the cult reputation it has. So, you did play this one, didn't you?
An opening chunk of it. I haven't finished it at all. I remember feeling like it was quite an exciting rush of cinematic moments, certainly in the stretch that I've played, like the way that you're buffeted between different sequences and camera perspective changes and weird little gimmicks it seemed to add for certain sections of it.
Seemed very experimental and fun in that way.
Yeah, absolutely. I think that the amount of FMVs in this, I think they stepped up massively from seven and then they were just so high-end as well compared to seven that it just, I think, like the reason a lot of the characters seem so vivid is you get to see them in that, those amazing FMVs and they give you a real impression of what they like look and sound like and how they move and how they behave. And so I think that dialed up people's investment in them a little bit.
So that's kind of a key part of it. Anything else to point out here, the junctioning system is gameplay wise quite controversial because essentially you had to go around harvesting spells and then you had to attach the spells to your stats in order to improve them. So let's say you get a hundred fire spells, you attach that to Squall's strength and then he is stronger, but he would also do like a fire elemental damage when he attacks characters.
So it's a really rich system in terms of its potential, but it does also mean you have to it kind of dissuades you from using your spells as much or creates a risk and reward thing where you're like, do I want to ever weigh at my strength by using too much of this spell that's quite hard to get that sort of thing. So that's quite interesting. Yeah, I just love I love it.
I thought it was great. I think I probably for a long time probably preferred eight to seven. These days, it's a bit a bit more in the other direction, Matthew.
So yes.
Okay. We all know you secretly like this one more. That's okay.
Well, you know, it's, it's actually like the thing that kind of lets it down is on the last disc, it locks you out of the open world. So you can't I say open world, the world map, not an open world. So you can't go back to places because you travel to the future.
And so everyone's like, everyone's pretty much dead is a suggestion.
I heard someone say that broadly, people like they like eight and 10 or they like seven and nine. Do you think there's much in that?
I don't really get that actually, no, because the thing I think that nine has is that it has like connections back to the more medieval style roots of Final Fantasy is like five and four and even earlier than that. So seven, to me, it feels like seven, eight and 10 and maybe 13 are a bit of a set to me and maybe 15 as well, just because maybe it's the Nomura connection there.
But yeah, from afar, I always, you know, I could see the through line from seven to eight in terms of like tech and just how good these games looked. And definitely like the but you know, the buzz there that didn't necessarily transfer from eight to nine. Like when I was reading Games Master, I wasn't as into whatever nine was doing.
Yeah, I think that nine just seemed slightly less sexy by comparison. You know, just look, it didn't have the humanoid, they had like it had the slightly deformed character designs, I guess is the right is that the right word I don't really know, like, I guess stylized character designs, you know what I mean? So the sort of big heads, little bodies kind of thing that was maybe not quite as impressive to people at the time is like these are these are real people.
I mean, Squire just looked like River Phoenix, you know, it just that was like the the goal there to make them seem like real people. And so it also arrived really late on in the PS1 generation, like I think that by the time it launched in the West, the PS2 was already out. So it was late on, and yeah, maybe not as sexy by comparison, Matthew.
So it might be a bit of that to it. Okay, number two, Final Fantasy VII. I think that the reason this game's reputation remains so sort of like it remains in such high esteem after all this time is that it's sort of like it's so complete feeling.
There's just so much going on in it. And it just the story never really slows down right up until that final fight with Sephiroth. It just keeps escalating and escalating.
So you get obviously, spoiler alert, the death of Aerith. But then you get like the weapons coming out of the crater and then like this sudden feeling of the planet fighting back against Shinra and the people there. And you get the meteor in the sky and this feeling of impending doom.
And then, yeah, you get like the weapons fighting Shinra and blowing up the cannon when it's strapped to the middle of Midgar and there's just all these like elaborate kind of like big storytelling beats that happen throughout the game. It just keeps going and going. And then it also just has like loads for you to do after you've actually like when you've got to like the very final fight so you can go and like do the whole Chocobo thing.
You can go and find more summons like Knights of the Round. And you can go and explore places you haven't necessarily been to before. And it just there was just this feeling of like it's kind of the everything game in a lot of ways.
It's just so elaborate. It's got like the Gold Saucer in it. So you can go and enjoy lots of in-game kind of minigames and stuff like that.
Just just so much meat on the bones of this one. The characters are just so so iconic. And I can see why its reputation remains so so strong after all this time.
Even if gameplay wise, I don't know if materia is necessarily my favorite system or I think it's that exciting. It's sort of like progressing like magical spells having their own different their own sort of progression track essentially and becoming more powerful. It's cool to have those spells level up, I guess.
But I don't know if it's more exciting as a system than the Sphere Grid is in Final Fantasy XV or like the Gambit system is in XII, for example. I don't know if gameplay wise 7 necessarily has anything that elaborate. But I suppose, Matthew, to your point about presentation, this was the first one where they did like the 3D camera battles and you had like zoom in some characters that do spells and stuff like that.
Things you just couldn't do on the SNES. So, yeah, can certainly see why it was this huge moment. And yeah, after all this time, my appreciation of it has only grown.
Any thoughts on this one, Matthew?
I do love the opening stretch of it. The bit that I have played, you know, I played it several times because I didn't have a safeguard when I borrowed a PS1. It's just so iconic.
The music is just amazing. And that opening cut scene is definitely like a chills moment. I think a lot of the stuff it was doing on and trading in is just stuff that wasn't happening on Nintendo at the time.
Like its values of storytelling and cutting edge presentation are very different to Nintendo's kind of gameplay first ethos. So it just seemed totally different and totally exotic, but also incredibly exciting. And it is kind of where games went and what they value more than other things now, I would say.
I am interested, as someone who hasn't played much beyond... I've got out into the world map and kind of pootled around a couple of places, but this second act of it that we're getting remade, has that got delights greater than the first act?
I think so, but I was quite interested that when 7 Remake came around, people were kind of like, well, the Midgar bit is the most iconic bit of the game. I can still see why, because it has this like Blade Runner-y presentation and the music just really dials up the industrial dystopia element of that part of the game. Whereas when you get out of Midgar, it's completely different.
The world's, you know, it's not all doom and gloom. There's, you know, bright and shiny bits. You go to the Costa del Sol, and it's like there's dudes in swimsuits playing beach ball.
And yeah, the vibes of it completely change. I personally think that it only gets better once you leave Midgar. But, you know, yeah, there's certainly some delights out there to be found, some good storytelling moments.
I have to play VII in its entirety. And then I've got to play these remakes. It's just too much of a blind spot.
It's like a sacred gaming text. I feel terrible for having not played it. I feel bad about not having played Final Fantasy XVI, but having not finished VII is really...
That's like a film critic having not seen Citizen Kane.
Good film Citizen Kane. I watched it during the pandemic. It's decent.
Do you like the opening stretch of Citizen Kane, or like the second stretch where it goes more open world?
I like it when he fights the Midgar Zollam and impales it. It was a bold choice by Orson Welles.
Do you know if Rosebud was the name of his chocobo?
Rosebud was the real name of the Buster Sword. Has playing XVI given you more of an appetite to play the older ones, Matthew, or less so?
It's definitely given me an appetite to play Final Fantasy VII Remake. It's less so playing XVI and more the fact that Final Fantasy is on people's minds a lot, and people are talking about it. And I always feel like a bit of a lemon not being able to kind of take part in quite a massive series.
Like, I look down on people who haven't played as Zelda or haven't played the key Zelda games. And I would imagine I would look down on me, you know, as a, they would look down on me as a fantasy non-player. So, yeah, I should, I just need to get on top of it.
They're not that long, are they?
They're pretty long. I think they're sizable enough. You'd end up spending, you have to allocate at least 40 hours for most of them, I'd say.
They're not short games.
That's doable. Like, I've played 150 hours of three Xenoblades. So, yeah.
And Tears of the Kingdom. How many hours are you up to in that Tears of the Kingdom now?
120.
Yeah, the risk of turning every podcast into the Tears of the Kingdom podcast, as it's been happening more and more.
I should just play seven and we can do a deep dive seven episode.
Yeah, that'd be cool. But no pressure because that is a big undertaking.
I just want to know what a Bugenhagen is.
I love that would be your motivation for playing seven for the first time.
I just want to see it to make sure it's as shit as I think it is. Not the game, specifically Bugenhagen. I don't think anything called that can be good.
No, but that bit is cool because he explains basically the history of the universe in a kind of a sort of like an observatory kind of area basically. All these planets are spinning around him when he's talking about it. It's pretty cool, but yeah, okay.
Well, I'll let you decide on Bugenhagen. That's a good grudge for you in 2023, I think. Okay, last one then.
Super predictable. Final Fantasy X is my number one. I think this is my number one because it's a real personal choice from it being my first big Final Fantasy for sure.
But I also think that it does have the right mix of story and gameplay mechanics. It's sort of 50-50 to me because the sphere grid in the game essentially allows you to board game like move your character, each character in your party around this big board, unlocking these different nodes which increase your stats, add new abilities, that sort of thing. But the interesting twist is they all share the same board.
So in theory, if you keep playing and playing, you will fill up the board and all your characters will be as good as each other and have the same abilities and stuff like that. The reality is it takes many, many hours to do that. So most people won't end up doing that before they play the game.
But it means there's loads of head room for you to... You can even delete nodes and then add new ones. So if you don't want a plus one strength node, you want a plus four strength node, you can delete the plus one one and then replace it.
So you can essentially just make your... If you're willing to bother to do that, and this takes hundreds of hours to get the most out of it, you can do it. So I think just by having that ceiling alone, it makes the combat...
It just makes the gameplay mechanics that bit more sophisticated. And so you have that alongside this turn-based combat system where you are told whose move it is next all the time. There's a big like...
There's like a bar that's got a running bar that tells you, okay, it's Wakka's turn next or Yuna's turn next. And then when you cast like haste or something like that, it will show you how your characters will move up in the pecking order, essentially to unleash attacks. And so it gives you all this information about your characters and how the game works that allows you to make good informed decisions.
And I think that it just means that it's a really spot on RPG experience in that respect without being too complicated. So that's one part of it. The story, okay, the voice acting is not very good in this game.
We can all agree on that. And there are some like compromises and localization. Sorry about you jumping in there.
It doesn't hurt my ears.
No, I mean, there are the bits like the laughing scene is all over the place. Yeah, I know, but like, but I don't think it's always bad is the thing. I think that some moments do land.
And it's got like, I think the reason that I really like the story is it has this really downbeat feeling to it. Because obviously it is about this force called sin that is basically keeping this entire world under duress. And the people there feel like they are, you know, in servitude to this religion in order to like, in order to not die, essentially.
They have to follow these teachings in order to like to keep living. And no one, no, no world, no like part of this world can ever build up too much for fear of sin coming along and destroying it. And you see early on in the game, sin destroys this town and just goes around like murdering all these people.
And it's just got this really melancholy feeling of death pervading the entire world. You're always seeing these, these kind of like, these little spirit lights kind of moving around that suggest that dead people have just been left there and just kind of haunt the place. And it's really unusual to have that amid this quite cheerful looking tropical environment.
It's a really beautiful and bright place. And that contrast just really works for me. And so the whole kind of cycle of death element to the story, I think works even when the sort of like John DiMaggio doing like a daft bit of dialogue doesn't necessarily click.
So yeah, it balances out. So 10 is my favorite.
I love that it's got all that stuff and Whacker.
Yeah, and Blitzball, a minigame that people seem to hate except for me. But I'm a big Blitzball head. So yeah, 10 is like the complete package to me.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone who's new to the series for the first time. But I don't know, if you've played even if you've played like one other Final Fantasy and you're curious about what else to play, then 10 is probably the one where I'm like, this is the this is the complete package in one game, I think. So yeah, not a sequel though, which I'm not a fan of.
So yes, that's my top five, Matthew.
Catherine really, really loves 10 as well. I think, though, you probably both played at a similar time, at a similar age. I think it probably just hit right at a certain time.
And that is a big part with these games is like the one that you play first or the one that you play in your formative years is the one which like absolutely gets under your skin. Because Catherine is like super, super into like, what's her name? Who's the main girl in this one?
And, you know, when I played it, I could see I was like, oh, these characters are like quite nicely drawn and everything. But like, she's really into that character in a way that you only can be if it came part of your like interwoven with your DNA at that age.
Yeah, I think that is true. Yuna is a good character, though, because she is she carries the weight of, you know, her father was the guy who killed Sin last time. And now it's expected that she'll do the same here and then give her life in service of doing that like her father did.
And so that's quite an interesting hook. And really, she's making all the decisions that drive the story. So even though Tidus is the protagonist, he's sort of just along for the ride, really.
Yeah, I can see why she would click. She's also she seems passive, but she's not really passive. She is capable of making decisions.
She chooses to, you know, defy the religion at the heart of the game. She almost marries the gross guy Seymour, just to broke a piece and stuff like that. You see her making these calls along the way.
It is pretty gross, but yeah, their wedding seemed like it was a nice affair till they all turned up on the airship. But who am I to say? So, yeah.
You see, my biggest takeaway from it was that guy who said, Shoo Puff in that weird voice.
Right, is he Shoo Puff?
Yeah, so I can see why Yuna would click. How did Catherine feel about her hot pants and handguns age, Matthew? Did that click with her as much?
Oh, I don't know. We haven't spoken about that.
Well, you know, those are like Yuna's college years, basically. So, yeah.
You always make some mistakes, so now you...
So, honorable mentions, Matthew. Pretty much the entire series, I guess, is an honorable mention here. Like, they've all got reasons to play them and check them out.
They are all pretty widely available. I personally wouldn't bother with 1, 2 or 3 these days. I just don't...
I think they're just too old. You've got better things to be doing with your time. I would rather...
Personally, I would rather spend my time digging out Final Fantasy Tactics or something like that than playing 1, 2 or 3, just checking out the spin-offs. Yeah, not quite one of my honorable mentions, that one.
What?
Well, if you like fishing minigames with using a Wiimote, then, you know, by all means, knock yourself out. This is not my sort of thing, dog.
That... Crystal Bearers is the responsibility of the... the Kawazu, the weirdo behind Final Fantasy II and its weird systems.
Yeah, yeah. Like, those systems in II. Because I slightly...
I slightly misidentified II in my original outlay there. III is the first one with the job system. II is the one that, yeah, bends the game around how you progress.
But most people will just find that too confusing and hard, to be honest. I think. So, yeah.
Yeah, like, yeah. Crisis Core. I love that as a spinoff entry, obviously.
I've talked about that before in the podcast. XV has, like, impeccable vibes, even though it's all over the place story-wise, and there's not much to the combat to speak of. But those vibes are so good that I argue that it carries it through anyway.
And, yeah. I don't know. Just, yeah.
Pretty much the entire series is worth checking out.
XV is the loopiest thing. For all the stress of trying to get it over the finish line, yeah, they still had time to do two quite weird demos, which were set in bespoke areas. An app pinball game that you could play, and all that weird DLC, and a movie you had to watch, and maybe some anime as well.
What a thing.
It's a shame, because I get the impression that the vision of XV with the DLC was to build it into a more complete thing with each DLC. But what they really should have done is just made one big expansion that expanded on the back half of the game. They sort of did that a little bit, but I think that's all.
They should have just said it's 20 quid and we'll give you the complete version where it's another open world and you can go and do all this other extra stuff. I agree those chapters by themselves don't really add too much. I did like that.
That first demo was awesome, though. The one they did in 2015. That was in the game, that section.
Oh, yeah. Maybe I'm thinking there was one which was set in a weird dream mind palace, right?
Yeah, with Carbuncle. Carbuncle. You're kind of like, you're little and then like, but then everything else around you is big.
It's like that Alice in Wonderland level in Kingdom Hearts or something. It's quite strange.
If I was struggling with the late game problems that that game had, I don't know if I would sign off on, let's do this other thing which isn't even in the game and you're going to spend some time with Carbuncle.
Do you know what? I think I agree with you on that one. I think that was a strange call, you know.
I would have at least explained what the fuck is going on with that weird dude in the hat going around. I had no idea who was the end boss in that game, I never really knew what his deal was.
I thought he had the makings of a good villain, old Ardyn.
Yeah, Ardyn. But he just sort of like, he tells you, oh yeah, go in this crater and fight Titan and you're like, either fuck are you? And then later on it's like, oh yeah, I'm actually like, one of your evil relatives or something who's travelled across time or some bullshit.
It was very confusing.
The weird moments in that game where the summons did turn up were quite exciting. Like when you hit the weird secret criteria that didn't tell you for them turning up.
Yeah. There's also a bit they added in the revised version of the game and they added some bits to the last city in the game. There's a cutscene they added where all the summons turn up and it's fucking amazing where they do that because they are all just such spectacular looking things.
Just like Titan running across the city and then like Bahamut firing laser shit from the sky and stuff. They really got that part of the game right. The summons have the same kind of impact in XVI, do you think, because I've only seen I've seen four of them so far because they appear quite early on in the story.
Are there many more to be found Matthew?
There are a few more. I think they spaff too much of it in the trailers in the previews and things. They're mainly only used for boss fights.
You don't have control over summoning them. It's more that you kind of absorb like a bit of their moveset into Clive's moveset is kind of the mechanic. But they are cool.
The boss fights with them are often many phases long and you get to really see them do all their iconic moves and things like that. It is pretty rad.
Yeah, okay, cool. That really works, I think, as an approach. So yeah, excited to see those even though I do think that the old like Hiddens, Hiddens Summons was part of the magic of Final Fantasy for a long time.
And so I guess they're harder to do in the modern age where they just require so much work on them. So it feels crazy not to sell the game based on them. So yeah, but part of the magic of Ted as well as finding like the Magus sisters and Yushimbo and Anima, Anima was in the trailers, but the rest of them you just didn't know about.
So yeah, I think that kind of worked.
What are the Magus sisters?
Magus sisters, they're like three bug ladies who, like you tell them to do, you give them like prompts, you don't give them commands, you give them prompts and you're like, you know, use some magic or something like that, they'll just drop a spell, but you don't determine which spell. But between the three of them, they can do a phenomenal amount of damage. They're really strange characters though.
Did you not get these ones when you played through 10 with Catherine?
We didn't go like super deep into like collecting everything.
You have to go into like, there's a secret temple in the Calm Lands and you have to basically do a lot of random tasks and get a couple of items to get them. They are the, they're like the final summon in the game basically. I remember thinking, oh wow, I can't wait to get these, these things.
If they can, you know, Anima is like the second to last one. If they're even better than Anima, it's going to be amazing. And it's like a little lady who's like a little wasp lady and it's like a little lady, ladybird lady and then like a grasshopper lady.
They're just quite strange to look at. Yeah, they're very, very odd. I think they previously appeared in something like five, I think they appeared in.
So they were returning some and yeah, they were just really bizarre. Yeah, Ten's got, Ten's got some amazing summons. So yeah.
Okay. That's pretty much it, Matthew. That's my top five.
So, you know, it's over now. We did the Final Fantasy episode, but we've got like a bonus round to come. So shall we take a quick break and come back with that?
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay, welcome to the bonus round. So people have been listening to the podcast lately, or noticed that me and Matthew, for a laugh, have just started bolting on lots of random questions to ask each other at the end of these episodes. So we just did this in our Boss Battles Excel episode where we asked things like who is the most ideologically correct boss, who would be the worst boss to work for in real life.
Matthew selected Hitler from Wolfenstein, which was a great podcast moment. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I mean, it was, you know, who can disagree with that, frankly?
Name a vile boss.
Okay, so yes, we're doing the same thing with Final Fantasy. Matthew is going to ask me some rapid fire questions here. I will try and answer them relatively quickly.
So about 14 of them here, Matthew. Do you want to kick them off?
You're a starter for 10. What's your favorite Final Fantasy battle theme?
Gosh, this is like probably the hardest question on this list because it's just so, because they always nail this. It feels like they must put so much work into figuring out a battle theme that people can listen to 200 times without being mad and still being pumped every time they hear it. I am actually going to pick, controversially, the Final Fantasy XIII battle theme for this.
I think I do, you know, you hummed it earlier. I think that is like the right mix of, when it kicks off, it sounds like, oh, okay, you know, it's like battle set up music. And then it turns into this really exciting kind of like thumping theme.
And it sort of, it just, it matches the world and the characters really well, that theme as well. It fits the kind of set piecey approach to the battle system they've got in the game, where it has the snagger system, and you're building up to that moment. And then when they, you know, when you get, when you reach it, and then you kind of like go all in, it just, it just, it really kind of tunes nicely into what that battle experience is like.
So yeah, pick that one, Matthew.
A little shout out for Final Fantasy XV from me. I love that theme.
Yeah, there's like several different ones for that one, but the basic one's really good, for sure.
Shimomura banging away on a piano.
Yeah, absolutely. Like that was, that was the cool, you know, because obviously Shimomura did Kingdom Hearts as well, and those soundtracks are kind of similar. So yeah, it really works, I think.
Oh no, am I Secret Kingdom Hearts-like?
This is like another slightly controversial one, but I'm going to pick XV for this one, because I'm actually specifically picking the very like booming opera-y track from this one, Omnis Lacrima from Final Fantasy XV.
See you next time!
They used it in the FF Vs XIII announcement video, so it was around in the trailers for ages. But anytime you hear this, it's like opera singers in the background. It's got a proper, oh, it's really popping off kind of feel to it.
And I think they only save it for the really, really big battles. Yeah, that one really does it for me. That sets the stage so, so nicely.
But shout outs to the themes from Seven as well. Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da. You know that one?
That was good. And then Ten as well, which is, Ten's is really intense and dark, and again, feels very dramatic, especially compared to the battle theme. The battle theme, I said this before, sounds like soundtrack to watching a horse racing show on Channel 4 or something.
It's just really all over the place, I think. I like it, but it's quite unusual. So, yeah, Eight has got a really good one as well, but yeah.
Whenever I hear the little kind of keyboard-y riffs in Final Fantasy VII, I always think of the doors. I find it very distracting.
Yeah, that's true, actually. I never really thought of that. That's quite a good shout, but yeah.
Yeah, I'll put a little blast of the Final Fantasy XV boss theme in here so everyone can hear it in its full glory.
People are always complaining we don't talk about game music enough, Matthew, but hopefully this explains why. Having to hear me fucking hum this stuff out loud.
Da da da da, da da da da, da da da da.
Yeah, it wasn't good, was it? Okay, next up.
Who's the best party member from the series?
I'm gonna take my guy, Auron, from Final Fantasy X here, guy with a big sword who drinks from a little flask of booze at all times, just to kind of keep himself going.
How do you know it's booze?
I think it's pretty strongly suggested that it's like sake or something. I think they had to swap it in Kingdom Hearts for like a water bottle or something. I can't remember, but they did something to like...
In a can of Ryo. He's drinking from a can of Ryo.
Yeah, that's a sort of defang him slightly for Kingdom Hearts, I think, so they took that out. Auron's is great because he's also like incredibly strong. His moves, his moveset is great.
He's added like partway into the game, so it makes a difference when he joins your party. And I think that he was just never out of my party. I remember this one guy who was like kind of an idiot who was in my science class at school.
The one thing we bonded over was Final Fantasy XV. And he would just every now and then he'd ask me, how much damage does your Auron do? And that was like a thing we discussed for a while.
Yeah, so I'm a big Auron head here, Matthew. Do you have an answer to this one?
The chef from Final Fantasy XV.
I thought you'd pick him. Yeah, I thought you'd pick him because he just makes food for you. So that in your eyes, yeah.
Okay, next one then, who's the worst party member from the series?
I'm afraid I've got no time for Cat Sith from Final Fantasy VII. Just a little fucking dummy lad, like soft toy. I could never figure out what his combat style was about.
And it just seemed like a bit of a waste of time to me. They kill him off at one point, then he comes back. I just, yeah, never quite gelled with that character.
Then I think he was Scottish in FF7 Advent Children, which I was really confused by. So yeah, he's not the one for me, dog.
Kimahri, bad hang.
Kimahri, actually, Kimahri in terms of combat and his usefulness, he was actually, I'd never found a use for him. So yeah, he would be up there for sure, Kimahri. I don't think it's necessarily a bad hang.
I mean, you know, compared to Wakka, I suppose, anyone seems like a good hang next to Wakka.
So it's just the old, it's cat people. You know, I'm not into cat people.
Yeah, fair enough.
Who is the greatest Final Fantasy protagonist?
Oh, this one's tough. I think I might go to bat for my guy Cecil from Final Fantasy XV because he sort of like goes through this sort of redemptive arc in the game. So he starts as like this, you know, this basically like darker figure that becomes this kind of holy knight type figure as well throughout the story.
So I think he's sort of, I guess he's the one where they really crack what the Final Fantasy protagonist is about. I think like that he's a good shout for that one. He doesn't have the angst of some of the later ones.
So like you can argue that as it reaches the PS1, PS2 age, you do get this anime protagonist type figure really become more of the central character in the game. But I don't think he has that in IV. In IV he's like this reluctant knight who is forced to fire bomb this village essentially and then realizes the terrible price of doing that.
And then yeah, from there kind of vows to sort of like turn things around. So I think he's very richly drawn and sets the template for what follows in a lot of ways, Matthew. So yeah, I'm gonna go with Cecil for that one.
What about, who's your worst protagonist?
I think this would have to be Vaan from Final Fantasy XVI. He's just a real blank slate of a sort of like Naflux Skywalker guy. I just don't really see what his deal was.
He felt like he really was created to just exist in the shadow of Bolthea. So yeah, he's poor.
You don't buy into his delightful friendship with Penelo.
Oh god. It's like everyone in that game has a name that sounds like it's a type of pasta. There's a bit of that going on.
Yeah, those two characters are just kind of wet and boring, and Bolthea just seems so sexy and exciting by comparison. So yeah, it's Vaan just kind of by default in some ways.
Cool. In which case, who's the greatest Final Fantasy antagonist?
I think this would probably be Sephiroth.
Hell House! Hell House!
Yeah, Hell House is obviously up there, you know? Just really sort of sticks in there. I mean, people talk about Hell House more than they talk about the antagonists in most Final Fantasy games, to be honest.
But actually, well, give us the Sephiroth rundown.
Yeah, so Sephiroth was, you know, the key thing with him. I definitely said this on a very recent podcast, but you don't meet him for a long time. You see him in Flashback, you know, you see his origin story, you see him burn an entire town down and go completely mad, but you are always building up to your encounter with him.
And then, you know, when you do meet him, it is this epic kind of like one-on-one duel, essentially, and to turn a cap off the story. And so I think that that sort of like feeling of symbiosis between Cloud and Sephiroth is kind of the reason that people are just really into those characters and that world, I think. It just really powers the entire thing.
So he's up there. I don't know, like Kefka from Final Fantasy XVI, he would be up there for me too. Just a really great, great antagonist.
A riff on the, I guess, on like the Jack Nicholson Joker.
He's pure chaos, his motivations seem really unclear, and he's just really scary. It's a good game, man. It's a really good six.
There aren't that many great antagonists in Final Fantasy, I would say. The one in 16, I'll just say the female antagonist you meet early on in that game, seems like she's got the makings of a great antagonist, Matthew. That feels like a character I've not seen in Final Fantasy before either.
Yeah, she's a real piece of shit. But there's the other one who looks quite like the mum, he's in the opening cutscene, Benedicta. The mum is a really well-drawn piece of shit, that character.
Yeah, on the antagonist front, I like the judges in Final Fantasy XVI. The concept of them is good. I know that's taken from Final Fantasy Tactics, I think, that idea.
Then Sin is a good overall force. It seems like an insurmountable force you need to take on at some point. So I think that works well in X.
Yeah, I don't know. That pretty much covers the highlights, Matthew, for me.
What about the worst Final Fantasy antagonist?
This has to be Shuyin in Final Fantasy XVI, who is kind of like Tidus. He looks like Tidus from the past. There's a whole NAF romance between these two characters in Xanacand, a thousand years before, that it sort of informs the story of XII.
So Shuyin is just like Aldi Tidus, basically.
Aldi Tidus.
It did not work for me at all, any of that romance from a thousand years ago. I think it's like really, really bad intent to that story. So Shuyin is the one here for sure, Matthew.
But my guy Seymour is a good antagonist in a way because he really riles you up and you want to kill him. But he is also quite a bad hang. So he's sort of like an honorary remention for Seymour here, I guess.
Yes, wonderful. Our next question. What is the best Final Fantasy spinoff?
By default, this is probably the Final Fantasy Tactics series, right? It's super credible tactics games, a different vibe, a little bit to mainline Final Fantasy, but just really click with people and people still love those games years later. My personal pick, though, is obviously Crisis Core Final Fantasy XV, the story of Zack.
Pure seven out of ten game this, but story that really sticks in the memory. So that's great. And theatre rhythm games are cool as well as a kind of like musical tribute to the games.
The version they've done this year, the whatever, is it called Curtain Call or something like that? It's like a final version they've done of like Final Bar, something like that. Yeah, that's cool.
It's got like 900 tracks in it, it's just unworkable at that level, you know? There's something where it goes beyond like, wow, that's thorough to like, no, too much, no.
If you start at one and work your way forward, you'll never get past two, that's what I think, because you'll just be like done by then.
Maybe this is against the rules to say this, but I think if you put that much Final Fantasy music together, you begin to realise that maybe it's a little bit samey.
Yeah, there's a bit of that, but you know, this music is meant to have different purposes essentially. I can sort of see how it happens, but yes, okay, next up Matthew.
What is your least favourite spin-off and don't you say it, you motherfucker?
I think it probably is that by, well actually, do you know what, there's another Crystal Chronicles game I played on DS that's like worse than that one, what was it, the one that also was on Wii 2, is it Echoes of Time? I think that's the one.
It was like a cross-play DS-Wii one, yeah.
Yes, that one I did not like at all. It was like, yeah, it just looked quite ugly I thought and the sort of like, the visual tech they took on DS was sort of semi-successful I would say, it's not necessarily stood the test of time so yeah, that Echoes of Time I think is the one where I was like, I don't know who this is for, it doesn't really feel like Final Fantasy to me, I don't know why it's the same game on Wii and DS, that feels like a bad idea to me given how different their capabilities are but yeah, so there you go Matthew, I'll give it a stay of execution for your beloved Crystal Bearers.
Stay of execution for my beloved Crystal Bearers.
Crystal Bearers you can at least argue is an interesting spin-off, you know?
It's definitely interesting.
Yeah, it is. I wouldn't give it like a fucking nine or whatever you gave it for, you know, whoever but yeah, it's just, yeah, I think I gave it a five or a six and that's fine so yeah. Okay, next up Matthew.
What is the best Final Fantasy minigame?
It is Triple Triad but Triple Triad is ruined by the random rule as previously discussed on the podcast so Triple Triad wins this by default I think.
No also runs?
Blitzball isn't also run but people just seem to hate it too much so it's, you know, it's tough. You know, worse ones are like, there's like, Blitzball in X2 is much worse than Blitzball in X, that would be up there for me but there's actually quite a few bad minigames in that series so yeah.
Not a big Final Fantasy XV pinball downloadable app guy.
Did XV have some minigames?
It had a pinball table and you could download it as a separate game.
Yeah, I don't know, I just, I engage with this stuff less and less. Does XVI have any in it?
No.
Oh, that's interesting. I'd have...
It really like, XVI has cutscenes and fighting and walking and nothing else. Like that is it, there's nothing else.
Interesting.
But that's, and that's maybe fine. Like what you played in the demo, that is it.
That's good, so it's a good demo in the sense that it represents the entire experience.
It's very honest about what it is.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool.
Do you prefer Final Fantasy when it's more sci-fi or fantasy based?
I think the series needs a mix of both to kind of keep things interesting personally. But I do have a personal affection for the sci-fi side of things. I think when they heighten things and make them seem a bit weird and, you know, and just a bit high-tech, it kind of works.
I think some of the stuff you see in XIII backs that up, how extraordinary some of the more futuristic environments look. And VII as well is probably... VII sort of does sci-fi the best, where Midgar just looks really sort of cool and weird and near futuristic and quite different to other parts of the world.
So yeah, I like a bit of sci-fi tinge to these games. But then when you kind of ground it a bit more like you do in XVI and it's more muted, I think that maybe unlocks different types of tones and storytelling. So yeah, you know, a bit of both, Matthew, goes a long way.
What's the worst line of dialogue from any Final Fantasy game?
I think this would have to go to Final Fantasy XV when Tidus... they say that they're going to a place called Makalania Temple. And then I think Tidus says...
I thought they said Makareda Temple and then goes, I?
And it's a reference, obviously, to the Makarena song.
There's a Makarena reference to Final Fantasy XV!
Yeah, it's quite a famous one, or an infamous one, rather, and it's such a bad call. Just like a horror show of a decision by the localization team. Yeah, I mean, even by 2001, like, who was still listening to the Makarena at that point?
So yeah, Makarena Temple, aye, that would be up there for me. That's bumpy. Bumpy ride, man.
This is where I tell you that Final Fantasy XVI is full of I think you should leave memes.
That's like the show I do not click with, that everyone else clicks with, and I'm like, the internet's rough out there, man. The amount of people posting memes from that show, it's like good content. I'm like, fuck, fuck this shit.
This is like, the internet is dead to me now. It's like a wasteland. So I at least get the, you know, we're all looking for the guy who did this one.
That totally works as a kind of like modern age kind of, you know, sort of like meme you can apply to everyday life. But some of these other ones, man, I'm just like, oh, I don't care about this computer screen gag or this guy in a car or whatever the fuck. I'm like, yeah, I get it.
You know, you just.
Final Fantasy XVI is Clive's dad flopping out of a coffin. Actually, we don't know who did this meme. It's quite relevant for several bits in Final Fantasy XVI.
I'm surprised that you're a big, I think you should leave guy. Cause that seems like the sort of thing you would normally. Yeah.
Each, each series has like one or two sketches where I'm like, this is really, really fun and it's often the ones with the, is it Sam Richardson, his pal in, like the baby of the year in the first season. But a lot of them is just man shouting and asking, maybe I see too much of myself in it and I just find it embarrassing for that reason. It's like, oh yeah, I would double down.
It's a guy who like doubles down a lot. That's the joke.
Yeah. You know, it's fair that it's like, it's quite singular and people seem to really dig it and fair enough, but yeah, just not for me. It's like the whole drill thing.
I don't really get that either. You know, I get it. I get why people are laughing, but I'm like, it's just weird for the sake of it.
I just whatever, you know, I'm out on this stuff. So it's just like just a guy writing in lower case font something really bizarre. And people are like, oh my God, that's so my vibe, man.
I just can't be doing with it. So yeah, so many people have logged off now this podcast probably fucking love drill. So yeah.
What's next, Matthew?
What is the coolest super boss from the series?
So many good ones. I do love a good super boss, i.e. not a character, not a boss that's part of the main quest, but something you have to go and find near the end of the game.
And I think this goes to Emerald Weapon from Final Fantasy VII, which is the underwater thing that swims around. And that's just, it's very bizarre. And like when you fight it in battle, it just destroys you with all these like absolutely brutal attacks, really difficult to unpick.
But I like the idea you have to get in a submarine, go down and find this like, you know, this sort of like aquatic monster to kill it essentially. I think that works really well as a bit of stage setting. But the Dark Aeons and Ternacle, because they're like, all your allies have turned into these evil fucked up monsters that you have to go and wipe out across the world.
So yeah, they're like kind of horror, horror style enemies.
I wonder if they'll do those super bosses in the Final Fantasy remakes.
Yeah, it feels like they have to because the weapons are a part of the story. They are unleashed to protect the planet basically. That's the planet protecting itself.
And you kill them? What a dick move.
Yeah, I guess you do kill them because I think the implication is they might kill everything if you don't. But they are extremely difficult to kill. Did you ever come across a desert one where you see a little red tail or something sticking out and then this giant red monster thing leaps out of the desert at you?
They're quite scary as ideas go.
Last question then Matthew?
Tough one to call this because some of these stories are all over the place. I think XVI does kind of work as a story because it has the very simple angle of the planet is about to be destroyed and there's nothing we can do to stop it while also knowing that this one on one duel with Sephiroth is the thing that you're building up to. Like this final encounter, I think that I think that journey works.
It's got the most kind of momentum to it and it's apart from some of the Genova stuff being quite confusing. I think like the I think like the the the Nibelheim flashback stuff is so effective in this game too. It just gives you so much context for what's going on and why things are the way they are and then it fills in some gaps of clouds memories later on in quite an effective way.
I found Seven Story quite easy to follow for the series. So that's up there. Six would be up there as well.
Six is just such a daring game in terms of some of the late game twists it tries. So yeah, that's my answer to that one, Matthew. That's it.
We've done it. The Final Fantasy pod is over. It feels slightly anticlimactic now we've done it.
I was like, I always knew this pod would happen and now it's happened. I'm like, that's probably like a seven out of ten episode for us. Oh, no, it's good.
I liked it.
Yeah?
Yeah, we covered lots of ground.
We did. Yeah, that's good. So it was like, like I say, I'm not like the biggest expert on the series, but the bits I know, I know really well.
So hopefully that came across well to the listeners and it was nice to hear your 16 insights.
Well, I enjoyed listening to it.
So thanks, pal.
That's all that matters. A series I wish I played more of and that's largely down to hearing your enthusiasm for it. Like I'm definitely way more into the idea of it after doing this pod for a couple of years.
Oh, good. Well, I appreciate that, man. Yeah, I like, I'm sure this series will come up again at some point.
Maybe when we do what we've been playing, I can play some more of XVI and we can get into some more detail.
Yeah, I'd like to go more into it, because I think there's some really interesting stuff in there and I'd love to talk more openly about it and I'd love to hear your take, so.
It's just trying to cram in all of these big games that have launched at once at the moment. It's just fucking, yeah, I don't even think I'm going to get to Diablo before like the summer at this point, so, or late summer, so.
I will have played, I will have played Final Fantasy VII by the time the remake comes out. If only for work, I have to be on top of this stuff now, so we'll definitely have a Final Fantasy VII episode closer to that.
Sounds good to me, man. I'm always happy to talk about that game in more detail.
Look at that, committing to 2024 content, yikes!
You'll have to cram in Crisis Corps as well, Matthew. You can probably leave Dirge of Cerberus, you can give that a miss, you know, but yeah. Crisis Corps is quite relevant to FFVII Remake, is the thing, so I'm afraid you've signed up to play a fucking 90 hours of games now, so that's tough.
That's fine, that's the castle way.
Okay, good. Well, the podcast is over. If you'd like to support the podcast financially, it's patreon.com backpagepod, where you also get two extra podcasts a month at the XL tier.
Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
At MrBazzill underscore pesto.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts. The Twitter feed is backpagepod.
There's also a Facebook page now that I've set up. So that's if you just type in the Back Page: Video Games Podcast on Facebook, you can follow us on there, too. I'll probably replicate the Twitter content on there if you are on another decrepit and controversial social media platform.
And yep, you can also email us at backpagegames.gmail.com. We'll be back next week with Two Giant Men Replay Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater. So goodbye, goodbye!
