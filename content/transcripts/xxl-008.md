Hello, welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, I'm so tempted to go like, the name's Roberts, Sam Roberts, but I thought that would have been a bit lame, so I didn't bother. Would that have been good?
Something being a bit lame never stops the James Bond films.
Or indeed this podcast. Or this podcast, you know.
Indeed.
I do have one thing to share with you upfront, actually not related to James Bond. I went to Metina in Bristol for the first time yesterday, and fucking hell, their chicken wraps are like the best things. Maybe some of like the five best food I've had in Somerset full stop.
Like that is phenomenal. You'd recommended it before.
There's an SEO article, if ever there was one.
Yeah, one for Somerset Live below like the foot found in park or whatever, whatever else is going on that week. So yes, that was a good Matthew Castle recommendation. About Â£7.40, absolutely phenomenal.
I was like looking for flats in Bristol, like looking around areas of flats rather to see where might be a nice place to live. So I'm gonna try and buy a flat, all that fucking nonsense business. And yeah, went to Sidney's Market, had to try Matina.
Always has a queue and now I know why, cause good God.
Quite a fast moving queue though.
Yeah, that's it. You just pay, then it's in your hands in like five minutes. Yeah, it's really, really good.
Do you miss it? Not working in Bristol anymore?
I miss that. And that's probably the only thing I really miss is that place and Sandwich Sandwich.
Yeah, I might go there next time.
Which gave me heartburn, heartburn.
After eating brownie, brownie and yeah. That's enough of that I think. So yes, we are doing all the James Bond movies ranked this episode.
Much like the God of War sort of ranking, this ended up being so much bigger of a time sink than I thought it was gonna be. I thought this was gonna be quite a relaxed affair, but I ended up taking it really seriously. Instead of just going off of memory, which I've seen all of these films.
I've seen most of these films at least a couple of times. This time I just decided to take it really seriously. I ended up watching 15 of them for research for this.
Which is a lot. So that process alone was long and drawn out. Matthew, I suppose to start with, let's revisit the question we posed all the way back in the deeply unpopular episode two of The Back Page:, which was James Bond, good or bad?
Because I know you've been watching some of these and some of your opinions might have changed. How do you feel about the overall sweep of James Bond movies?
Basically everything I watched flipped my opinion of it a little bit. Maybe not entirely flipped, but things that I thought were great were less great than I remembered. Things that I thought were dreadful were maybe less dreadful than I remembered.
And it kind of creates this sort of soup of three-star entertainment, which is James Bond, which I think might just be the fact that I haven't rewatched a lot of these films for quite a long time. I'm a little bit older now, and I think this is like the perfect 14-year-old boy series. And it's just very, very hard to recapture that.
But they definitely have a lot of charm, and I would still consider myself a fan. I just, my big hot, hot take is I don't know if there's a genuine five-star film in the bunch.
Yeah, I think there's like a borderline four-star film in the bunch. And then definitely a few four-star films.
Oh yeah, there's some four-stars, there's fours, threes, many twos.
And many ones, I would say, as well. Well, maybe like, well, we'll get into this, we'll get into this. But yes, I think I roughly agree with that.
I sort of, the thing I try to put myself in the headspace with watching these back is to remember that they emerged from a time where genre entertainment and franchise entertainment was very, very different, where these films start 15 years before Star Wars, for example, which arguably is like a milestone in terms of how entertainment is franchised and what that entertainment looks like, the shape of it. And so there's a lot of them figuring out what it actually looks like when the only, maybe the only comparable thing around at that time is something like Planet of the Apes, where there's like loads and loads of sequels to that.
Right.
So I can kind of say, I kind of don't mind the rough edges so much, but then there are entire periods of James Bond where it just, the quality just dips for like basically like an entire decade. And then you might have one or two sort of like exceptions to that, but it has somehow kind of weathered the storm. And while it has been kept kind of relatively sort of modern throughout that, which is definitely key to its ongoing success.
It's not, it's never been like that modern until like maybe about 15 or 16 years ago. It's a very formulaic series in a lot of ways. And it took watching all these back actually to start seeing just how many fucking ski chases there are in this series.
How many times like a larger vehicle steals a smaller version of a vehicle? Like, you know what I mean? Like, you see that a lot.
I just love that the logic of, if you want to steal a vehicle, the best technique for this is to build an even bigger version of that vehicle, but then eats it. It's just, it's absolutely hilarious.
That happens at least three times in these films. That's amazing. And then also of course, like a tank of water that has some kind of aquatic predator in it that will eat human flesh.
Like that, that is, I think in four of the films, maybe more. So yeah, you do start to see the patterns. So yes, I agree, very much still in the kind of like good camp.
So a rough overview then for the different Bond eras for people if they haven't watched them for a while, because I think this is useful. So franchise starts in 1962. It's based on these books by Ian Fleming, who's like, I mean, you know, he's kind of like got big British Empire colonial energy when you read about him, lived in Jamaica, just like seems like it's very, very shaky opinions, cursed British stuff, but obviously kind of breaks this kind of world that people find very compelling.
The films, I think their relationship to the books sort of fluctuate quite a lot over the years. Some are more direct adaptations, some are not. Eventually they run out of source material and then create original stories altogether, which is basically what's been happening for the last 20 years or so, maybe actually more than that, about 25 years.
So yes, it's an interesting one. So you start with Connery, who's this very masculine, slightly wry figure, very much kind of defines the character. Briefly replaced by George Lazenby, an Australian actor who was kind of known for a chocolate commercial, who kind of like lobbied hard for the role and quite smartly for the role when you read about it.
Basically walked into the office and was like, I'm gonna be James Bond. And then they hired him. He was much younger than the others as well.
I think he was 29 when he made the film, whereas I think all of the other ones have started in their forties or late thirties. So bit of a difference there. Then you have Roger Moore, who's basically like, I'm gonna turn these into a carry on joint and basically like raise an eyebrow and sort of like put all my acting effort into innuendo rather than anything else.
Then you get to Dalton, Timothy Dalton in the late eighties, who's much more serious, like a proper actor. Not sure all of these, the actors who played James Bond are proper actors, but I think Dalton kind of is. He's got emotional range.
Then you get to Brosnan, who's a bit more like, kind of like all the other ones before him combined a little bit. He's got a bit of the sort of Connery masculinity. He's kind of good with the old dumb, innuendo, wisecracks.
And he's extremely handsome and has a physicality to him that makes him quite intimidating, a bit like Dalton. Then you get to Daniel Craig, who's a very modern, dour, realistic, down-to-earth version played by a phenomenal actor who is able to give the character some range, even if not all the films are good at making the most of that. Is that fair, Matthew, as an overview, do you think?
Yeah, that's a great overview. Yeah, I think you've nailed them all perfectly. It is interesting, though, when you look at the casting stories around this, that I believe this is correct, that Roger Moore was in the mix to play him originally.
That makes sense, because he's 45 when he takes over the role.
But just think how different this whole thing would have been if it started with Moore instead of Connery. You know, it's hard to sort of see whether the films come from the actors or are made for the actors. Because, like, you know, Moore doing Connery's script, you know, there isn't loads of kind of eyebrow raising in it.
Well, it's not as much. It's not as naff anyway. That's something I've never really understood.
Yeah, there's a few instances in the timeline of these films where you wonder what if they'd have, like, gone with a particular casting decision. Because I think they wanted Dalton when they were trying to get more, I believe. Like, he was about 25 and I think he thought he was too young for it.
So, they kind of have these very fixed ideas of who they want, and they kind of go with them. Even like Brosnan, I think, they tried to get Brosnan when Dalton started, too. So, they are like, but he couldn't get out of his contract with Remington Steele, which is like a TV show in the US that made him famous.
So, yeah, like, also, like, you notice throughout these films, the same actors pop up over and over again in different roles. Like, the second M appears in The Spy Who Loved Me as a different character, for example. And I think it's the love interest in Man with a Golden Gun is also Octopussy, I think.
So, I don't know if they just got, like, there's, like... Yeah, then the actor Shane...
The really wild one is when the informer, James Bond's informant in You Only Live Twice is Blofeld in Diamonds After Ever. Like, you can't bring back, like, one of his mates as Blofeld. Couldn't you think of anyone else?
They don't even put him in a board cap.
Yeah. Really bizarre. Yeah, we can get into some of this more, I'm sure.
Yeah, so it's a bit of an odd history. Actually, Matthew, I did not put this in the plan, so I want you to ponder this throughout the podcast and we'll revisit it. But if you could put any James Bond into another Bond's film, any Bond actor, what would you pick?
And I'm going to give you my pick up front, just so you can see how I'm thinking. I'd put Dalton on Her Majesty's Secret Service. I'd love to see what that looks like.
Oh, interesting.
Yeah, because I think he's got the depth for it, the range for it. Lazenby, I think, is all right, but I'll be curious to see what that looks like.
You wouldn't have to dub Dalton, I don't think.
No, but that's actually not true about Lazenby. They only dubbed him for the bits where he plays the...
Oh yeah, that's the bit I'm thinking of. Even that I find very incongruous. I think Dalton could pose, could do a Scottish accent.
Yes, and isn't it more like a camp British accent? Isn't that what they're going for?
Maybe that's what they're going for.
I'm pretty certain that's what they're going for. They're like a very poorly rendered of its time depiction of a gay English man. And it's not cool.
What I'm saying is I think Dalton could pull it off.
Yeah, okay, fair enough. So, yeah, who's your favourite James Bond, Matthew? That's another good question to ask before we kick off.
Again, like, this changes with time. You know, like, when I was 12, I thought Roger Moore was absolutely brilliant. Now I'm watching it, I'm like, oh, yikes.
Probably, I'm going to say Daniel Craig, which is a bit of a, like, boring recency bias answer, just because I think he's the only Bond where they actually bake his aging into the role of the stories. And that's basically what does for every Bond. Eventually you get too old and the films try and cover it up and you always end in embarrassment.
He's the only one where actually the films sort of fit him at every sort of stage of his sort of development. And I just think that whether or not he's, you know, he is like individually the very best Bond. I think he just has like the most consistent and coherent run.
Yeah, I will say like 4K video has not been kind to all of these actors. Like I've never, watching Roger Moore on my little TV video Combi in like 2000 or 1999, you know, you don't see the sort of crags as readily as you do when you watch fucking 4K Samsung TV in 2022. You know what I mean?
Like that's stuff for different bonds. Yeah, I think I agree. Craig's got the best cross section of ability, the films being mostly good or at least partially good, and then, you know, the character evolving.
Whereas like you can't argue that for Dalton, who's probably the most comparable to Craig, you know.
Yeah, Dalton is the best bond who didn't get the films he deserved.
Yeah.
Like he arrives fully formed and he's really competitive. He just looks great. He sounds great.
He's got this real confidence. There's no sense of like nervousness of stepping into a role or trying to find your feet, which even like I think more, it takes a couple of films to really get into it. But Dalton's just there, but the film around him is quite drab, doesn't give him much to work with.
Yeah, he's even funny when he has to be as well. Like he's actually, he's actually good. I think like it is Craig, but then Connery, as a kind of like setting the template of the entire series, you know, Connery is obviously incredibly important.
More I think like you, he has fallen the most in my estimations, I think, after watching his films. Like this is not much to him really as an actor or to his Bond, you know, there's like, you get no sense of inner life to that character really. He just sort of turns up.
We love inner life on this podcast.
Turns up, shags, kills the enemy, wisecracks. Like that's all he does really. He doesn't like think about the consequences.
He doesn't live with a heavy heart. He doesn't have any of that additional depth. He just sort of exists really.
Collected his paycheck, then went into tax exile. That's like a big thing with early Bonds, isn't it? Just like not paying your taxes.
One of my favourite trends outside the Bond films is earlier Bonds dunking on later Bonds films. So like Sean Connery famously dunks on like Moonraker saying these films have got ridiculous. But then you have definitely Roger Moore dunking on...
I think it's Quantum of Solace. He dunks on for saying like the editing is too fast. Ha!
Died the other day, he didn't like either. He's like, oh, the Invisible Cars have gone too far. It's like, mate, you're in a car that was a fucking submarine, asshole.
Roger Moore basically cannot judge anyone else's Bond films. It's just not allowed.
Audacious, really. Top five Bond themes. I thought this would be fun to do.
I didn't want to do like all of the different, you know, Bond criteria, fucking gadgets, cars, you know, like Shudder, Bond Girls, none of that bullshit. So I thought we'd just do the themes because they are like, these are good even when the films are shit.
Oh yeah.
What have you got for your top five?
Nobody Does It Better, Garly Simon. You Only Live Twice, Nancy Sinatra. Big fan of that.
The World Is Not Enough, Garbage. Not garbage, it's great. Ha ha ha.
I really like We Have All The Time In The World, but I don't know if I like the actual song or just the tune, which whenever I hear it, I think is just one of the great swooningly romantic pieces of music. I've also got, and I don't know if it's cheating, because it's also on Her Majesty's, I've got the theme from Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Yeah, I didn't pick any that didn't have vocalists, which is the only reason I didn't pick that, you know.
Yeah, I picked that. I mean, if I was being really wanky, I think it's actually an end credit song that I think should be a Bond theme. I really, really like KD.
Lang's Surrender over the end credits of Tomorrow Never Dies.
Oh, right. Interesting.
It's an absolute, that is one of the great Bond themes. And it is, like she does sing Tomorrow Never Dies, it was obviously one of the ones in contention at some point. So, yeah, that's my slightly wanky tank.
Okay, cool, so that was five, right?
Yeah.
You don't like the sailors singing there? Nobody does it better at the end of Spy Love Me, Matthew? You're big on that?
No.
So I've got, mine's slightly different. I've got Licensed to Kill at Five, so Gladys Knight. I think that, like, when you hear that, when that hits, that's like very well, well edited place.
The big da, da, da, in that is really good.
That's really good, yeah. The Spy Love Me, so Nobody Does It Better, I've got number four. I've got Cheryl Crowes, Tomorrow Never Dies at number three, actually.
I fucking love that song. When I hear it, I'm properly teleported back to like 1997. It's just like, it's absolutely dripping in late 90s energy.
And then number two, I've got Skyfall by Adele, which I think is excellent. Tend to be like, you know, female vocalists just tend to be like a really good fit for this stuff, of course. And then I've got You Only Live Twice, number one.
I think it helps that that was in an episode of Mad Men, so maybe I thought that was cooler than it actually is based on that.
Oh, it is good. It's like subtle. It's also kind of, you know, it's weird and a bit sinister.
I like that. That's a good tune. And the do, do.
It's just like one of the absolute classic like Bond motifs.
Yeah, but I do agree with you overall that if I had to pick one soundtrack to an entire film on a Majesty Secret Service, it's like, it's incredible, minus that song about Christmas, which is rubbish. Do you know how Christmas trees are grown? That's terrible.
That soundtrack's so strong that just them repeating it in No Time to Die, I found incredibly moving.
Oh, really? I found that really cynical, actually, as we'll get into. I hated that.
I thought, come up with your own fucking motif.
Oh, I loved that.
So the best you can do is to repeat. It's not like I can put like the Schindler's List theme tune in fucking John Wick 4 and make an emotional moment, you know what I mean?
That's completely different.
How? It's not his film.
But it's Bond. It's like it's tapping into like this sort of like history of Bond. A Bond film can use another Bond theme.
It's not the same thing as John Wick using Schindler's List.
A Bond theme from a time that the Daniel Craig films explicitly rejected when they rebooted it. And we're like, no, we're not this anymore. We're better than this.
And then like, they're like, oh, yeah, we're just, yeah, you know, a bit of Honour, Majesty, Secret Service, just make this land a bit more rather than like coming up with our own bit of music. I just, no, I want nothing to do with that.
You're a hard heart. That gave me chills. That's one of the reasons No Time to Die is as high as it is on my list.
That has made it a lot higher than it otherwise would have been. Some of the differences in our voting will be fun to get into, Matthew. OK, good.
Matthew, should we take a quick break there and come back with our Bond films ranked?
Yeah, let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. Let's rank these 25 films, most of them shit. I'm only joking.
Most of them are average or not very good. But the ones that are good, I do very much like. It will be a fun list to tear through, I'm sure.
Matthew, right at the bottom here, we've got the final Connery film that isn't Never Say Never Again. Actually, we should point that out, shouldn't we? That we only did the Eon produced ones.
Never Say Never is fake, fake-sy.
Yeah, absolutely. And he's so fucking old in it, which I know is part of the plot, but it's, you know, et cetera, et cetera. We don't need to go into it.
So, Diamonds Are Forever is at number 25. Little synopsis here, Matthew. James Bond masquerades as Peter Franks to uncover a diamond smuggling conspiracy.
He must also deal with his old rival who wants to use the diamonds to build a giant laser. Now, I will point out these are taken straight from Google and some of them are so fucking brain dead. Like, it feels like they were community contributions, quote, unquote.
Wait until we get to the On a Majesty's Secret Service one. I cracked up at it. So, yeah.
So, this one, yeah, basically like On a Majesty's Secret Service comes out. It's not as financially successful as the Connery films. They pay Connery 1.5 million to come back.
He looks a lot older and more tired than he did previously. I don't know what happened. He's only like 41 or something in this, but he looks like he's been editing a games magazine in between, Matthew, just like proper run down kind of thing.
But more than this, I think it represents a course correction from On a Majesty's Secret Service to make the film sillier again. When they bring back Blofeld, like you say, they use an actor we've used before, but also I would have just used Donald Pleasance, who was like in You Only Live Twice, because he was at least synonymous with the Connery kind of version of Blofeld. Instead they use this other guy.
And it's just quite campy and boring, and I actually thought it was genuinely terrible when I watched it. It just did nothing for me whatsoever. I feel like it was maybe a mistake to bring Connery back ultimately.
What do you think about this one?
Yeah, that's sort of fair. Again, I still remember liking this one as a kid, because I think it's got a bit of more energy to it. It's a bit sillier.
Bond goes to Las Vegas. There could have been something in that, the kind of fish out of water. I always find Bond in America, they never quite land it or do anything particularly interesting with it.
How do we feel about Mr. Winter, Mr. Kid?
Oh, God. Conflicted? Would that be the right term?
Yeah, so these gay assassins who, I think I said this to you on social and Discord, they feel like a mad ex-military British Empire man smoking opium in Jamaica, what he would think gay people are, with no evidence whatsoever of what that is. And it leads to really bizarre... It just doesn't work, really.
But some people in the Discord have a little bit of affection for these characters, I think, because the actors who portray them are quite interesting, I suppose, but ultimately I'm not a fan.
What about you? The stuff, again, that I reacted to as a youngster is the slightly more, in hindsight, outrageous stuff or the kind of henchmen. I liked Odd Job, I liked Jaws, Mr. Winter, Mr. Kid.
I just like their names. But it's not stuff you pick up on. It's not stuff you pick up on in the mid-90s anyway.
We live in more enlightened times with a lot of these things. This is also Bambi and Thumper.
Yes, that's right. The bits where all those women are doing gymnastics and beating up Sean Connery.
I quite like that. Too many pairs of outlandish characters in this film. They should have dialed that back.
But they also do the thing where Blofeld's in drag. That's really like, okay, this is where we're at. It's not good.
The Las Vegas thing is a little bit interesting setting-wise, but like you say, they don't do much with it. What was the other thing I was going to point out about this one? Oh yeah, I would agree with you that I do enjoy a secondary iconic villain in these films, like a henchman with a bit of colour to them.
If your main guy's a bit weak, you can have a colourful henchman really pick up a lot of the weight, I think.
Paper over the cracks, yeah. So yeah, kind of a strange one tonally and not very good. I don't mind this being at the bottom, but I will say that there's a few here at the bottom that could have been very bottom, and it wouldn't have mattered too much to me based on the voting just because, like, I don't know.
Well, it's only like two to three of them, but yeah. OK, moving on then. Octopussy.
James Bond sets out to foil a nuclear attack on NATO. However, in order to do so, he must enlist the help of a circus group and its obscure leader. Octopussy.
Now, generally speaking, Matthew, I think that this, the lower band of more films are all kind of interchangeable to me in that I don't really love any of them. I don't like any of them, really. They are just like unenvolving, no drama to them, not much panache to the set pieces.
The only bit from this I really kind of like is when he's sliding down the stairs with the, when he's firing his machine gun and then he shoots the bannister at the end so he doesn't get hit in the balls. That's the only bit I like from this film, really. What are your feelings on this one?
Yeah, like, I've just, I've just never, I've just never liked it. Like, even when I was younger, you know, even though this is one of the sillier ones, it's never really clicked for me. The whole kind of art smuggling ring at the heart of it, I find not confusing, just a bit baffling.
Like, what, the guy has such a strange plan to smuggle these, like, warheads into Berlin using some kind of art smuggling ring. Also, Stephen Berkoff is just fucking honking as this comedy Russian guy. Stephen Berkoff is who you hire if Peter Stormer has too sucky for you.
Just appalling.
OK, very good. Yeah, I think that's all we need to say about that one. Just like, yeah, these small ones that just make me wonder how on earth the franchise survived the 70s and 80s, like, intact, because there was so many naff ones.
Just Octopussy as well, like, the concept of naming the film after this character who takes ages to turn up. It doesn't seem that important. I just never really got what the central idea of this film was really meant to be.
They just like the word Octopussy, I think, Matthew, from that story and then just thought, well, we'll just do that then. Because I think isn't it called Octopussy in the Living Daylights? The story or something?
I think it might be. Yes, next up then, Matthew, number 23, Die Another Day. Now, this film, it's not nearly as bad as its reputation suggested to me upon watching it this week.
This is one of the ones I hadn't seen, actually. And like, it has a really dreary opening, like in Korea, which is...
Well, Korea, but it's obviously filmed in that place in Hampshire where they filmed the opening of Gladiator. It's just British countryside.
It's the most plainly obvious not-Korea setting you could pick. I was definitely like...
It's like, that's Faerum, or whatever it is that they always use for filming in the UK.
For Faerum.
For absolutely one... It's like, welcome to North Korea, or Faerum.
I grew up, like, ten minutes from Faerum, so that's a really funny reference. Yeah, it's obviously the UK where they filmed it. And it's a really boring intro, and then I thought, oh, this is going to be shit, is it?
But there are actually things I like about this, like... I think the sword fight between Bond and...
Have you got a synopsis?
Oh, yeah, sorry, I should do that, I should know. James Bond is assigned with the mission to inquire about the connection between a Korean terrorist and a diamond baron. However, upon being betrayed, he gets captured by the enemy.
I think that's just really just the very opening of the film, that is.
Yeah.
Yeah, not the rest of it. Yeah, there are things I kind of like about this. I quite like, yeah, like I say, the fencing duel between Bond and Toby Stevens' character, can't remember his name.
Graves?
Good stuff, Graves, isn't it?
Yeah, I think that's right, yeah. And then I like the underground, the London Underground base that MI5 is using in this. That's cool.
I like the, let's think, what else do I like about this? Oh, Rosamund Pike, she's really good. I think she's quite a good sort of like wrinkle character at the centre of it.
There's like lots of NAF stuff to it. I don't think either of the main villains are particularly iconic, but I do think that Madonna's in it as well, which is quite NAF. A little bit of Madonna sprinkled in there, because obviously that's the theme tune.
The theme tune is really bad. I don't mind the kind of like big ice space. I think people love to use the invisible car in this to batter the film with, but I don't think it's noticeably worse than the other rosters.
I think 100%. I think the problem with this film is everyone dunks it for the invisible car and they dunk it for that terrible CG bit where he surfs to escape the ice palace. Yeah.
And everyone remembers a couple of very bad minutes. And actually, it's fine. This isn't my least favourite Brosman.
I think it's quite good fun. I quite like the glow popping in it. The career stuff is like NAF, but it gives it...
It's a slightly different enemy for them to deal with, which is interesting. Yeah, I think this is okay. I think there's a bit of re-evaluation for this one.
At the time, I was incredibly pumped for it. Probably The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day was when I was most into Bond, and both of them didn't really do it for me. I really bought into the whole...
They were like, this is the Bond where he gets caught by North Korea and he gets tortured for all this time and he comes out a really different Bond. It's going to be a much darker Bond. It's going to be about what happens when Bond's been abandoned and there's huge tension with them.
Actually, he has a shave and all his trauma vanishes.
That's true, but I do think that it does give it a different vibe. That's what I found really confusing about the perception of this one as being quite campy and stuff. I was like, it's not mega, mega serious, but he has quite a stormy relationship with them, I would say.
He does feel betrayed by the fact that he is... To get him back, they basically give up a terrorist who's a massive threat and Bond doesn't think it was worth it. That stuff, the tone of the first half of the film is not at all wisecracking and all that stuff.
It's very much quite low-key, and then it just becomes a bit sillier in its second half.
Yeah, it ends up with a giant laser shooting down from the sun or something, doesn't it?
Yeah, but again, it's part of the course of some of the bullshit in these films. I'm just surprised Bond fans are so appalled by it, and it is jammed with references to previous films, which again, how high are the standards of these people who survived the Roger Moore era? Do you know what I mean?
For me, this is slightly too low down on the list. I don't think it's that bad.
That's good. I think I actually tempered some of my judging because I didn't want to be judged by you.
No, that's terrible.
You've underscored Die Another Day.
Bollocks. There's maybe three films directly above this that I would never watch ahead of this one. Okay, let's move on.
Number 22. For your eyes only, after a British information gathering vessel sinks into the sea, Agent 007 is given the responsibility of locating the lost encryption device and thwarting it from entering inimical hands. What the fuck does that mean?
Enemy hands, I assume they mean. Who the fuck wrote these things? Inimical?
What the fuck is that word? Have you heard that word before?
No, I couldn't identify that word.
That's so confusing.
The one Google search result is that synopsis.
I have to remind myself of what this one is, because some of the names of these films, particularly the later more ones, I just get the three of them confused basically. So this is the one where I think they basically went with, it's like retrospectively been rebadged as an attempt to return to more serious form after Moonraker, but it's shit. It's fucking crap.
It's so boring. That's the thing. They mistake the subtlety of From Russia With Love.
Whenever one of these films is subtle, they always say, oh, they're trying to tap into From Russia With Love. But it's just boring. It's just not interesting.
Set pieces aren't good. It's got another interminable skiing segment in it.
Oh, the longest ever. It's like 20 minutes long. And why would you go back to skiing after The Spy Loved Me?
Why would he bother? He already did the ultimate ski set piece.
I know. That's the thing. Bad.
It's got that very annoying American ice skater who calls him Uncle James. I hate that. That's weird.
Because he's so old at that point. And I really hate the opening sequence of this film, which is Bond picks up Blofeld in a helicopter and drops him down a chimney, which I think is a really stupid ending to quite a good villain and quite a classic, the classic Bond villain, arguably, the man who killed his wife. And it ends with a bit of a lark.
Yeah. And also, I find this so confusing, right? So, first of all, people say that this is a more serious Bond film after Moonraker.
I would argue dropping fucking Blofeld in a chimney from a helicopter is not serious. That's quite daft. The one thing I like about this film is the actress who plays Melina Havelock, whose parents were killed.
I think she's pretty good. Carol Bouquet, or how have you pronounced her name, but yeah. Everything else is just dogshit.
Yeah, just crap. It's got the very silly face matching tech as well, Matthew. Do you remember that one?
I didn't re-watch this one for this episode.
It's like Q's got a thing where it basically matches the hair and the face, but it's done with a very really old school green screen computer and it's like this big basically drawing of a face and then bits appear underneath it and it's presented as cutting edge technology and it's so, so naff. That's funny. Yeah, this is really bad.
This made me wonder as well. It made me wonder if the profile of On A Majesty's Secret Service has somehow changed by 1981 because that was a film they seemed to want nothing to do with, but then that opening suggests that, oh yeah, it's this very poignant moment in Bond's life and I thought...
Oh yeah, so poignant that he drops a man down a huge chimney and it's just crap. Also, the character of Blofeld is tied up in this endless legal battle in real life, not in the films, because the rights to him, it's something to do with who owns the rights to certain books. So it is Blofeld, but they never refer to him as Blofeld and you don't get to see his face, but they know that you just have to have the silhouette of a bald man in a wheelchair and you'll go, oh yeah, Blofeld.
So even then, it's like a budget Blofeld. It's like they kill this knock-off Blofeld.
And he's also just like, he sat on top of a roof of a tall building, operating this remote control. How did he get up there? How was he planning on getting down?
And also, why would he just stay indoors and man it from there where he can't be picked up by a helicopter and dropped in a chimney? Because it wouldn't be convenient for this shitty set piece, would it, Matthew? Yeah, terrible.
Terrible film, this.
For your eyes only, one of the wild things about doing this list is after I put my numbers in, I was looking at loads of lists. And it's actually how inconsistent they are. No one really agrees what the best ones are.
But for your eyes only is often in top half, which I do not get at all. And with this line of, oh yeah, it's Roger Moore's subtle bond. And you're like, this is very bad.
I regret to inform you, there is no subtle Roger Moore bond. That's tied up with the limitations of the actor, I'm afraid. Yeah, rubbish.
Absolutely rubbish. That skig set piece, man. I was watching it yesterday, screaming at my TV, why aren't you fucking over yet?
Okay, next one. A view to a kill at number 21. Mack Zorin, a menacing microchip manufacturer, harbours a plan to destroy all of his Silicon Valley competitors.
Now it is up to James Bond, Agent 007, to put an end to the maniac's lethal intentions. I just think of this as the Christopher Walken one, Matthew. How do you feel about this one?
Yeah, again, I had a better reputation when I was younger, because I really liked Christopher Walken and Grace Jones together. I thought they were like, you know, when you're a kid, they're quite unusual presences. You know, they're not particularly interesting characters, but just physically they're so kind of striking.
It gives it quite a weird energy. I do like Bond's, where Bond spends a lot of time with the villains. You know, I quite like the trope of Bond goes undercover and kind of lives with them or gets to hang out with them, which I guess sort of starts with like Goldfinger.
You know, there's a lot of Goldfinger in that film. So I kind of like that about this one. I dipped into it rather than re-watched the whole thing, and I was like kind of shocked by how old Roger Moore is in it.
You're ancient. That stuff just doesn't stand out to you when you're a kid. You know, you don't have a concept of like age being, you know, huge sort of hindrance necessarily.
But this one, he just looks terrible. And it's the thing that gets me is it's not just like how little close up stunt work you see him do, because he's basically too old. It's how old all his oofs sound when he's like, oh, oh, it sounds like an old man really getting the shit beat out of an old time.
And it's quite sad. You're like, this shouldn't have happened.
Yeah, it's like, yeah. So by this point, I think he was about 50, like late 50s, like mid 50s. So yeah, really old, which is...
And it's not just like, it's not late 50s by like modern standards, because Cruise is like 60, isn't he?
Yeah.
You know, this is late 50s back when like bodies were like older. It's why George Lazenby looks, he doesn't look young when he takes over his bond because everyone looked old, like bodies just aged faster in the 60s and 70s than they do now.
Yeah, yeah, it's true. Like he's got way too many lines for 29, Lazenby. Yeah, it's funny that.
Yeah, I agree with you. So I do agree with you that like the redeeming feature of some of these NAFA more films is they do have, some of them have good villains. That's not true of Four Your Eyes Only, which also has a shit theme tune, by the way.
I'll point that out by Sheena Easton. A View to a Kill by Contrast has a fucking amazing theme tune. This actually almost made my top five, the Juran Juran one.
I think it's very fun, that one. I think I agree with you about Walken and Grace Jones. That's a pretty good combo to give this a bit of colour.
These films are all just a bit of a much of a muchness to me.
In the 90s, I was big into Christopher Walken playing villains called Max between this and Mac Shrek in Batman Returns. I hadn't seen all the stuff he's actually cherished for because I was only a kid slash teenager. But when you're a kid, this guy's always that weirdo who's the villain in things.
I remember being very fond of that.
You mean at age 11 you weren't a big fan of the King of New York, Matthew?
Yeah, The Deer Hunter. We were all playing Russian roulette in the playground in homage to our favourite film, The Deer Hunter.
I do feel slightly cruel being dunking on the more films like this. Like you, the way to watch these was to chain watch them on ITV1 in like 98 or 99 and then watching one a week. These are all perfectly fine in sequence because they're more like you're watching TV episodes and they're very silly.
I mean like the cycle of ITV would show one a week every couple of years and it was a huge deal for me in secondary school. Like me and my friend Craig were like super into Bond and I think we were like, I remember live re-ranking them based on where we were up to. So like every week we'd re-rank the whole series based on like what we'd seen or definitely the theme tunes.
We were just obsessed with talking about James Bond. So it's responsible for like really happy memories. You know, I almost regret going back to them.
I almost preferred the versions I had locked away in my head.
Yeah, I think we're doing this the right way though, which is like basically having a fundamental love of the films going into this and not just spending a lot of time dunking on the bits that like are massively out of date in terms of gender politics or whatever, because that wouldn't make for a fun podcast, would it?
Yeah. Also, Golden Gate Bridge is quite an iconic ending. Not as good as You Remember It, but like, you remember it, you know?
Oh yeah, yeah. I would say that the end of Rise of the Planet of the Apes is kind of like the signature Golden Gate Bridge set piece these days, I suppose, when I think of it.
I once went to a terrible film quiz in Bath where the quiz master did a round on which film is this landmark in, and he said, the Golden Gate Bridge. And we put V for you to the kill, and he was like, wrong, it's Vertigo.
Terrible, I must have told you about the X-Men thing with him as well.
I think you have, but you definitely hasn't come up on the podcast before, so go ahead.
So also part of that quiz, in another round, he said Vinnie Jones played which X-Men in X-Men 3 or whatever. And so we all put Juggernaut, because obviously he plays Juggernaut. And then when he was doing the answers, he said, Vinnie Jones of course played the astronaut.
And everyone there went, no, it's the Juggernaut, and the quiz guy took a beat and he went, okay, I will accept Juggernaut or astronaut.
Oh my God, the worst quiz master ever.
And it's like, it is an astronaut, and that's wrong and no one has written it.
But he has to maintain his pride by lying about it.
Well, it's an either or situation. He doesn't say, I'm the astronaut, bitch.
Oh, that's so funny. Which pub was this in?
That was the film quiz of the little theater.
What, the little theater did that? Oh my God.
They had someone else used to run the quiz, but then this one bloke took over for one week and it was just an absolute disaster.
That's amazing. That's amazing.
What film is Big Ben in? I hope he wrote The 39 Steps.
Oh, yeah. Oh, just, that's so, so good. What is the name of this actor?
It's a picture of Tom Cruise. He goes, wrong, Dustin Hoffman.
Oh, okay, okay, I'll accept Tom Cruise or Dustin Hoffman.
Oh, I wanna know where that guy is now. Oh, that's so good. The astronaut, oh, that's killed me.
Okay, where were we then? Oh, yeah, okay, so that's a view to a kill ticked off. Oh, that's so funny.
Number 20 is Moonraker, which I think again has a slightly unfair reputation. I'll just read the terrible synopsis from Google. After a space shuttle which has been loaned to the United Kingdom is hijacked, classic, James Bond is asked to step in and get to the root of the problem.
God, that's a terrible description. So this is where Star Wars becomes massive and they all drink too much of the Star Wars juice and decide to send Bond into space. It is super silly.
They also bring back Jaws, who is an excellent henchman from Spy Love Me, of course, and make him silly, give him a girlfriend. The tone of it is just quite daft by comparison. But I don't find it overtly offensive, honestly, compared to, again, it's slightly interchangeable for me between this and the other two.
I definitely can prefer this to Full Your Eyes Only. What do you think of Moonbreaker?
Yeah, I think it's okay. I think the actual space station bit is just so dumb that it's quite a hard hang for the final third. But him investigating Drax at the start, that's okay.
I think the parachuting stunt in the pre-credits sequence is absolutely still actually amazing. Like the physicality of them filming people parachuting and like wrestling over it, you know, I keep remembering all the fuss they made over that parachuting sequence in Mission Impossible Fallout where they were like, crews did all these like endless jumps and they had to train all these cameramen to do this really difficult parachuting scene. But I honestly like watched this moon raker one being like, bloody hell, they're actually like, it really does look like that, you know, they are doing all this stuff in the air.
It's quite impressive and I quite like the spooky bit with Jaws at like the Mardi Gras parade.
Yeah.
That's quite unnerving and even though like now their special effects are quite like ropey looking, the ski lift is a good set piece, I think.
Yeah, I think like you say, it's like it's basically perfectly fine, sometimes good before they get into space.
Yeah.
And then yeah, the whole, yeah, go on.
There's that terrible bit where he wears a poncho and it plays the Magnificent 7 theme tune. I just like, what?
Gross.
I just don't know what they're going for with that.
They play Lawrence of Arabia theme in For Your Eyes Only.
Which is like, that's like a little bit more, you know, that's kind of cute and you can kind of get away with it. And you know, Lawrence of Arabia feels more of a piece with the kind of, the world that Bond is coming from, rather than the Magnificent Seven and like, we're just going to dress them up as Clint Eastwood, who isn't in The Magnificent Seven.
Tough.
That's a real, someone's like, someone probably raised that, but a producer had already had the idea. And was like, make him dress up as the Western guy. And you're like, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah. Someone will dunk on this on a paywall podcast in 40 years, but sure.
Yeah, we'll have to course correct the films again after this, but fine. Yeah, so this made a ton of money, like, cause Star Wars was so big and this was clearly cashing in. Yeah, people went and saw it in drives.
Yeah, it's, but I don't know, it's not as offensive as like people, retrospective reviews would suggest it is, I would say. It's probably like just written off now as one of the worst ones. And yeah, don't know, I'm not with people on that.
Oh, thank God, we finally got through most of the shitty Roger Moore ones, Matthew. We can move on to shitty Brogson ones. So, this is interesting.
19, the world is not enough. I think this is quite low. So James Bond is entrusted with the responsibility for protecting the daughter of an oil tycoon.
While on his mission, he learns about an even more dangerous plot. Again, very informative there. You put this lowest in your list, didn't you, Matthew?
Yeah, I hate the world is not enough. And maybe I'm carrying some baggage. Like I say, I was never more excited for a new Bond film than after the one-two punch of GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies.
Bond was a big part of my life because of the video games. This was a film I remember being obsessed with before it came out. I'd read every feature about it in every film magazine or any information about this film.
I thought this was going to be the most exciting film of all time. And I just thought it was such a bust that the threat is to an oil pipeline, I think is incredibly underpowered. Denise Richards, absolutely terrible Bond girl.
I found the Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle pairing as a lecturer in Renard, I can see what they were going for. That they almost wanted this sort of, there's almost like a weird love triangle type thing kind of playing out between the three of them, but it just didn't land for me. It's just not what I want from a Bond film.
I'm watching it now, I thought, am I going to have a huge epiphany and see actually for its merits? But it's still incredibly flat for me. So yeah, it's my least favourite Bond.
So this is one of the ones I didn't have time to get around to rewatching. So I'm definitely leaning on your expertise here, Matthew.
I mean, my expertise, but I am like, I have held this to be the worst Bond film since the day I saw it. Maybe there's a bit of pride holding it in that position, but it's just crap. There's that bad boss fight against the helicopter with the saws.
That's just, that's rubbish. The end set piece. I'm not a big fan of water set pieces in Bond films as a rule.
And this one with like the flooding submarine and Robert Carlyle as this villain who can't feel pain. I just don't feel they do anything interesting with it. All they really do is that every scene he'll get shot and like shrug it off.
That's how they remind you that he can't feel pain. There's no like, he doesn't do anything like crazy, violent or mad to show that ability.
Yeah, Robert Coltrane's kind of funny in it, I guess.
I like the bit where he dies and he shoots him to free him. That's good.
Yeah, oh, that weird chair. What was that? Like that chair that she puts him in, the sort of sex chair which sort of breaks his neck, is such an ornate thing for a torture device.
That definitely stood out to me more on this rewatch. I was like, what is that about? Like, who built that thing?
I'm assuming it's a sex thing rather than a torture thing.
Yeah, I assume so. I mean, maybe this is a convenient device for that particular plot beat they wanted to do.
And the opening set piece, again.
What, The Millennium Dome? That's fun.
Oh, it's just so of the time, you know, like going down the Thames, which is actually a very boring location for a boat chase. It's just a huge expanse of water. And most of the shots are just him getting drenched in water and sort of coughing and spluttering.
It's a lot of Pierce Brosnan going, oh, as all this river water goes in his gob. It's really unpleasant to film. And it just ends on the Millennium Dome for like no reason.
Like if they ended falling into the Millennium Dome, it would be cool, because you get to see the inside space, but him sliding down it.
Come on, that's fun.
That's like a good use of a pointless landmark. This is just disappointing. This has got big disappointing Millennium energy.
The thing I will say, and I'll say for most of these films, that even the ones that I really don't like like this, I feel like you do see a lot of the expense on the screen. Like the fact that they go and film in these amazing world locations. There's a sequence in this where he just goes skiing with a lecturer and then all these baddies turn up.
But just the skiing sequence, you're like, yep, that's two people skiing down a huge fucking mountain. And it looks so tangible and real. And it just makes you realize that we live in this like, how unreal films are now and just no one films anywhere.
Everything's blue screen. Like even these films, there's a bit of traditional craft in them, which like where I am at now, I react to those things very positively. So that's something like the whole Bond series is a big tick for it.
It's like, yes, that is filmmaking, you know?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'm surprised you've got this, but would you really, given the choice between this and Diamonds Are Forever, watch this, like not watch this? Would you rather watch Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd do their thing?
Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are better henchmen than fucking Goldie.
Well, I suppose of their time in different ways there.
Yeah, to be honest, I don't know. I'd say a lot of these bottom 10 are quite interchangeable for me.
Yeah, I think that's kind of fair, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's fine. I was surprised to actually see, we were talking about doing this list and rewatching these films on Twitter, and I saw a few people go, oh, I always held the world's not enough to be the best of the Brosnans. That is something that does not compute to me.
No, no.
I just don't know how you can come out of those films and think that, but.
What I will say is, there's not a loads in it for me between the three Brosnans that are not GoldenEye. To me, they are basically similarly toned.
Oh, there's one I really like, which we'll talk about.
Yeah, okay, well, that's the clip you sent me from that one, Matthew, certainly gave me the biggest laugh I've had in the last few weeks. So yeah, I've got to say that this one, I really wish I could have rewatched this one beforehand. So I'm happy to lead into your expertise here.
I think it just wasn't overtly offensive, just like, yeah, middle of the road Brosnan basically. And everyone's fucking dunked on Denise Richards in this a million times, who cares? I do think the idea of a female villain is interesting.
They don't do that much in these films. Just not the nearly the best version of what that could have been, you know?
Yeah. Yeah.
Robert Carlyle, I do agree with you that that's rough. What was that giant CG head of Robert Carlyle you sent me?
Oh, that's when he's been briefed and they're like, Renard got shot in the head and that's why he can't feel pain. And they've just got this like 2001 ass.
PS2 render.
Yeah, of Robert Carlyle's head as a hologram. Yeah.
Taken straight out of 007 Nightfire, that one. Oh, very good. Right, next up then.
Number 18, the man with the golden gun. James Bond gets tasked with recovering a device that can harness solar energy. At the same time, he finds himself targeted by Francesco Scaramanga, the world's most costly contract killer.
I rewatched this one. I was very fond of this as a kid, but I think this is genuinely an iconic villain in this. I think Christopher Lee is really good.
Like, just has so much on-screen presence. And the idea of a three-nippled killer that uses a gun that fires gold bullets and is gold itself, that is a fun Roger Moore era concept. There's loads of pointless drudgery in this one, though.
So I think for its first third, I was digging it. Then there's loads of random bullshit in a martial arts place that goes on for about 45 minutes, completely fucking dumb, just really, really naff. And then I think it totally picks up in the last third on Scaramanga's Island, which I think is a great set piece, and actually original compared to some of the set pieces they were doing in these films, which felt very repetitive.
The idea of being in someone's weird domain that's got a bit of the old kind of like 60s Avengers quality to it, which...
Right, yeah, yeah.
That's like actually original and quite cool. And yeah, like it has a good sense of place. Matthew, do you think the portrayal of Nicknack in this has held the test of time?
Do you think that's a respectable portrayal of that character?
Well, I was gonna ask you, what do you think is Scaramanga in Nicknack's deal?
Well, he would suggest that he's like the caretaker, basically, but there's way too much fucking real estate for one guy to clean, basically. And even so, that asks a lot of questions about that dynamic.
Yeah, so it's implied that Nicknack is bringing these assassins to try and kill Christopher Lee, which you think, oh, is this like a training exercise? Christopher Lee basically like keep me on my toes by bringing assassins to my island, because I wanna keep, you know, otherwise I won't be the best shot in the world. Later on, Nicknack explains that if Christopher Lee dies, he inherits all of Christopher Lee's stuff.
Right. Which, that's what confuses me about the whole deal. It's just, he sort of hires this chap to keep him on his toes.
I guess he motivates him with the promise of inheritance.
Yeah, yeah.
Which is just, combined with the whole like, you know, knick-knack being a small person and quite, quite, you know, he's, what's that actor's name?
I didn't write it down, I'm afraid.
He's the guy from Fantasy Island. He says, it's the plane, it's the plane.
HervÃ© Villaches.
Villaches, yeah. Yeah, it is odd. I think what you said about the Avengers energy is actually spot on.
This has got big, surreal, 60s Avengers, which I really, really like. I just wish they'd have the confidence to have, like, just Bond versus man with golden gun through the whole film.
Yeah.
He vanishes for long stretches.
Yeah, it's like, I think we discussed this offline, but a big tendency of the Bond films that are more than two hours long is to jam a load of bullshit in the middle of it that isn't really related to the plot or is tangentially related to the plot. And that is basically what Bond, like, having these, like, martial arts duels are in the middle, and that dude turns up with those two girls and can fight and stuff. And, like, it just, all of that is a complete waste of time.
I agree with you, like, if the interesting stuff is like Bond versus Scaramanga, and it is, because you get that bit where Scaramanga kills a guy in that street where Bond is present, just to kind of, like, almost show off to Bond, like, how deadly he is. That's the stuff that's the most effective, or, like, when he kills that woman then, like, props her body up at that boxing match, which is quite sinister, like, that. All of that stuff works really well in this, I think.
Yeah, I definitely think you're right about that last said act. I just don't know if they ever truly sell you on Scaramanga's amazing ability. Like, he doesn't really do anything, which, where you're like, holy shit.
Like, there's a bit where he shoots, like, a cork out of a champagne bottle, but that's about as close as it comes to a trick shot in the whole film.
Yeah, but like I say, the assassination, though, from quite far range in the street, Bond can't see where he is.
Like, that's... Oh, I guess that's impressive.
Yeah, because he could have killed Bond, but chose not to. That's a good demonstration of his power, I suppose.
Also, the Golden Gun itself, I think, is one of the worst props.
Is it like a pen and a lighter?
It looks, it's a bot. I don't get the design of it at all. Like, the weird boxiness of it.
I never understood it in the game, you know, seeing it a lot in GoldenEye, but I really don't. And when you see it again in the film, you're like, it just doesn't look cool.
No, no, it doesn't. I do agree with that. Yeah, but-
Pop's department really let down Christopher Lee in this one, I think.
I will say that third nipple holds up quite well in 4K. I was surprised. I thought, I paused and I looked at the screen.
I thought, you know what? I thought I'd be able to see the seams on this quite easily, but actually that's a fairly convincing third nipple. The one that doesn't convince is when Bond is posing as Scaramanga and he has the third nipple.
I'm like, oh, that one, it looks a bit off color and gross. And I'm like, oh, okay. So yeah, that's my take on.
It looks like a dead nipple.
So yeah, it's kind of enjoyable. I did point this out on Twitter as well, but Bond basically making a very bad call for planet Earth by destroying Scaramanga's island, which collects solar energy better than anything else on the Earth. That technology would be good for humanity, but he basically set us back decades by destroying that because he's in the pocket of big oil, I assume.
Got a fucking BP giving him a kickback or something. All because he was wasting some of it on a big solar laser. Just destroy the laser, but keep the rest of it.
It's pretty good. That's my take on Scaramanga's island.
This is during a big fuel crisis in the UK where this one comes out. So I think maybe that stuff landed different. Like maybe the idea of having a really good solar solution seemed even sexier at the time.
It's a smart thing, obviously, but on paper you're like, mm, doesn't sound like the most thrilling set up for a film.
Yeah.
But maybe back then everyone had been like, oh my God, electricity, I can't believe it.
What I found really funny as well is like, when Bond arrives on the island, Scaramanga's like, yep, we're gonna duel, but before we duel, let me give you a very detailed tour of my island and like every single room of this fucking island. And I was like, okay, yeah, that's very like Bond exposition-y.
I think his fun house does a lot of his work for him as well as a master assassin. Like, is he a good shot or is he just really good at distracting you with bullshit?
Yeah, does he just know where the fucking hidden mirrors are in like the fake hallway and stuff?
It isn't a straight duel. A straight duel on the beach would be, I know that's something I don't like to see. That's interesting, would Bond win that?
But actually, it's quite a load of nonsense.
Yeah, I sort of agree with that. I have one last thing to mention about this, Matthew. What do you think about this dumb ass car that's also a plane?
Yeah, yeah, that's weak.
Yeah, how fast does that car have to be to like actually, to become an airplane? Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, I mean, this series has got a lot of problems with cars that become other things and how realistic that is or... I think, is it the beginning of, is it Octopussy or You Only Live Twice, which starts with the plane that kind of comes out of the horse?
I can't remember. I don't think it's... So you think it's Octopussy.
I don't think it's You Only Live Twice.
Yeah.
No, it's not that.
Anyway, yeah.
Dumb, yeah. Okay, next up then. Number 17, Quantum Assailants, another one I wish I'd re-watch this.
An investigation leads James Bond on the trail of Dominic Green, a renowned developer of green technology. When Dominic assists a coup in Bolivia to fulfill his intentions, Bond must save the day. So my big problem with the Naffa Craig ones, Matthew, is that if the story is not good in these ones, there's basically nothing else to salvage from them.
They are just dour, not entertaining, and a waste of time. Because that's what Craig's got right. He's like the tragic, sort of aggressive James Bond, very stern kind of performances.
And so if that character just placed in a boring plot, does nothing for me. But you've rewatched this, and I think put it slightly higher than me, or maybe put it lower than me, yeah.
Yeah, I remember this being absolutely terrible, and I thought it was sort of fine second time around. One, it's blessedly short. Like it might be the shortest Bond film.
I think it's like an hour 40.
Nice.
I mean, all of these films, I don't think there's a single Bond film which couldn't gain from losing half an hour. This is that version. It's actually got pretty good momentum.
Cause it picks up straight off the bat from Casino Royale with the guy in the boot of the car. So it starts with actually quite a well filmed car chase. That's the other film this film has.
It looks gorgeous. It looks expensive as hell. Cause obviously after Casino Royale, they knew Daniel Craig was going to be like big business again and Bond was like really back.
And this one, it feels like they pumped so much money into it. It really does look like a step up. Just great location work.
Some of the set pieces, there aren't a huge number of set pieces and what here is a bit undercut. I actually quite like old Matthew Almirick as Dominic Green. On paper underpowered villain because he's just a sort of philanthropist who cons his way into juicy contracts on various things and he's infamously trying to steal water from Bolivia, which is really dumb.
But the fact that he is so sort of like dweeby and sort of unassuming on screen actually makes him quite an unusual villainous presence. He definitely brings a different vibe to it. I think the sequence where Bond goes to the opera and then covers the conspiracy and he sort of talks into his headset and then they all leave and he takes photos of them and basically sort of sees everyone who's part of quantum all at once.
It's actually a really good sequence. It's dramatically very satisfying. It's really well shot.
The music's great. I think the problem they have with this is that, the really big problem is that Craig's character is just meant to be on like raging through the world because of what happened to Vesperin in Casino Royale. And they don't really sell like, Bond's gone off the rails or this is really dangerous.
There's meant to be this tension with them and none of that lands. So they've got like in Craig, an actor who can play dramatic Bond well, but the actual drama they've cooked up for him, I think is just a bit wrong in this one.
Yeah, I think that's all fair. That was a big sort of like sore point for me at the time as well is that I feel like the Casino Royale's ending very much sets up a second half to that story. And this kind of like has that connective tissue very briefly, then feels like it swerves into becoming something else.
And I kind of wanted it to be a much angrier revenge film than it is. And it just doesn't really pull that off. How much do you think the writer's strike that happened around the time this was being produced like hurt it, Matthew, do you think you noticed that in the writing at all?
Oh, yeah, maybe that explains it. I don't really know the in and out workings of it because it's got the same screenwriting team credited as Casino Royale. It's Purvis and Wade who are the kind of in-house Bond writers from sort of mid-Brosnan onwards.
And then they partner them up with other, basically whoever directs it brings in their good screenwriter to make it work. And it's Paul Haggis on this one and Casino Royale. He's obviously a bit of a contentious figure now.
You don't say.
Yeah, maybe it is the momentum, which just means they can't really land the kind of character beats. It's trying to kind of deal with the fallout from one film, introduce its own villain, its own plot. Maybe it's trying to do a little bit too much in an hour 40 and that's its problem.
But it just as a technical piece of filmmaking, it's just so clean that when you've come straight out of like watching Loda Roger Moore films, something in you reacts to that and goes, oh yeah, this is like we're in the hands of we're in the hands of like modern filmmaking, but also like modern expensive filmmaking. You know, there's just yeah, there's a bit in this, there's like a plane sequence where they jump out of a plane and it looks so much better than the plane sequence in that Uncharted film. That's what I was thinking when I was watching this was just actually we've how is it that we managed to spend more on films in the last, you know, now and they look worse than things from 10 years ago.
You know, there's just no no physicality to them. So yeah, any opportunity to dunk on that piece of shit Uncharted film. I'll take it.
That's like.
Or the MCU. Also blue screen hell. Yeah.
Quantum of Solace. Worst Bond theme ever.
Oh, yeah. So bad. So, so bad.
It actually sounds out of tune. Like, Jack White doesn't sound in tune. It sounds like they're having their first go at it.
Like they haven't really worked out what the theme is going to be.
Yeah. Oh, was it Dionne Warwick who did like a version of the theme for this? It was actually amazing that you sent me Matthew.
Oh, I sent you a video that was full of. Yeah. It wasn't Shirley Bassey.
Oh, maybe it was Shirley Bassey, yeah.
Bassey did a Quantum of Solace song. Yeah, there's lots of videos on YouTube that gather songs that were written for Bond films but weren't picked or didn't make it for whatever reason. A lot of them you listen to them and you're like, well, I understand why this wasn't picked.
Because the people, they struggle to like bond themselves up in the right way. There's like a pulp one for Tomorrow Never Dies. It just sounds like a pulp song.
Right.
It's a terrible Johnny Cash one. Is that Thunderball or Man with a Golden Gun?
I think it was Thunderball. Yeah, and it just sounds like a Johnny Cash song but every now and then it says Thunderball.
And he's stolen you, can he put it down? And he's gonna blow up the United States. And you're like, oh, Jesus.
Thunderball. Yeah. Thunderball.
Thunderball.
Terrible.
Yeah, I think I do agree with your overall point about like higher end filmmaking. Making these like an easier re-watch now. I think I'm punishing Quantum of Solace and then another Craig one we'll get into very shortly.
I just think that I lackluster when it comes to plot and execution of that plot and characterization. I suppose I'm punishing that, but I do agree with your overall point that all of the Craig films just like look and feel amazing. They are proper blockbusters of their time, you know?
Yeah, so much shameless. The product placement is just a lot more obvious in Craig because we're maybe aware of more of the products. You know, like in the 70s, you're not necessarily looking out for certain things.
But in this era, you know, when there's like loads of Virgin aeroplanes in the background of Casino Royale and fucking Richard Branson at the airport, you're like, oh no.
He's so obviously sat at the Virgin first class kind of bar as well when he's on that plane. Because I've seen that bar many times on press trips, of course, never going there myself.
I think if I owned an airline, I would not want my product placement to be in a scene which is about someone trying to blow up planes.
Yeah.
Because your association isn't like, I guess a Virgin plane doesn't get blown up, so you might associate them with safety. But it does, you know, the film's message is like airports and bombs is what you take away from it.
Yeah, it's like the old FedEx and Castaway thing, right? Where it's like, I think in their case, they were like, we won't give you a penny, but you can use it. And that seemed like a fair swap to me.
Do you know what I mean? It's like you need to blow up one of our planes. And you literally can't make this film without us.
Like we're the only company that makes sense. But we're not giving you any money because you are blowing up one of our planes, which is not cool. Yeah, yeah.
So yeah, okay, interesting Matthew. Let's move on to number 16, which is Spectre. This is quite low down.
James Bond receives an obscure message from Em about a sinister organization. With the help of Madeleine Swan, he uncovers the conspiracy only to face an ugly truth. God, these are so badly written.
So this one, I've punished this one for being like so disappointing after Skyfall. A really bloated, boring film. Again, like amazing production values like the Day of the Dead kind of like parade bit at the start.
It looks incredible. This film looks incredible throughout. It's just really kind of flabby and boring.
And I'm going to be controversial here. I don't think Blofeld overall as a concept is a net gain for James Bond. I think it's like, OK, I think he's in more he's been more bad.
He's used badly more than he's used well, I would say. The Christoph Waltz one was like one of my least favorite Christoph Waltz performances, kind of slightly just slightly smarmy, but not sinister and not like there was no real reason to draw his his background to James Bond. I think to James Bond, I think that yields nothing in the plot of this film.
And the big one is I'm afraid that Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux, both phenomenal actors, do not have any chemistry together.
100 percent.
And that's a killer.
A huge, huge problem with these films.
So what's your take on this one, Matthew?
Yeah, again, the disappointment after Skyfall. I think I managed to talk myself into thinking this was quite good. And then I went to rewatch it at the cinema.
I watched it again once it once had come out. And I was like, actually, no, this is bad. It has one of the most inert car chases in any Bond film, where it's just two cars driving like the same distance apart with like no interaction, no criss-crossing.
It's really odd. It's a bit like where you have like, you're allowed to have a car brand in a racing game, but it can't take any damage. So like all the fun bit of driving in a car and crashing in a car is taken out of it.
That's what this feels like. That just felt like product placement, two cars driving very safely through Rome or wherever it is. That's really poor.
I think the whole film doesn't really make any sense because Blofeld was trying to engineer this meet with Bond. He basically wants Bond to come so he can taunt him and give him all this shit. So why is he trying to kill him for the whole film?
Even on the train to his base, he sends old Dave Bautista to try and murder him. And you're like, this doesn't make any sense. You either do want him there or you don't.
What's going on?
It takes ages to actually get to it as well with him, to actually get to Christoph Waltz.
Yeah, and when he's there, he's just like nothing.
He just blows up his base and that's kind of it, isn't it? It's like it ends quite abruptly.
Yeah, he blows up his base and that sort of turns him into scarred Blofeld. That's what they try and do. It's like, oh, this is why his eyes are all kind of messed up.
They also try and do this sort of, you know, this was always planned from the beginning. These films try to pretend that all the Craig films have been plotted from the start, which just isn't true. Sam Mendes has come out on record and said, you know, my big regret with Spectre is that we just didn't have time to do the script and like work it out properly in the same way that we did with The Skyfall, which is why it doesn't really have a story.
It's just a journey with action set pieces along the way. Yeah, and this, you know, given that this bond is defined by, you know, a great love of his life, the love of his life who he's kind of like lost and has kind of like, you know, completely kind of fucked him up. The idea that this person he has no chemistry with is going to like change that or is going to somehow fix all that and become the emotional core of No Time to Die as well.
It's just, it's a pretty hard sell.
It's really tough. It's like there are a few problems with it. I think Lea Seydoux is an excellent actress more broadly.
It's like, I think the character is a little bit underbaked, but she doesn't have much of a sense of inner life. Funny to stop saying that. But you know what I mean though?
It doesn't feel like she has...
They should have got the fucking God of War Ragnarok team to write her. You want inner life? Have fucking five hours of inner life.
And here's a talking squirrel while you're at it.
Yeah, you need to go for a very slow ox ride through this jungle and then you might let Lea Seydoux more. How have we used this podcast to dunk on Ragnarok again? Amazing.
Yeah, so that's just like a massive problem. And I just, it's not something that can be, chemistry is not a thing you can actually fix, is it? It's not like you can force chemistry to happen.
It's either there or it isn't. And it just, yeah, it just so clearly isn't there. The final dunk, Sam Smith's Spectre theme is fucking shit.
I hate it. Yeah, it's not, like the music, it's like overall is fine mostly, but it's just the lyrics are really lame. It's like, yeah, it's a bit sort of pop boy bandy.
Just, we can do better, guys.
It's just nothing.
Yeah. And I don't actually agree that the Radiohead ones are good for either. They just needed to keep fucking trying till they got a good one.
But yeah, that's such as it is. The one sequence I do love in this is the meeting of Spectre. Like, that's cool with all the shadow, where you don't really get to see both out and then they kind of cast the light on Bond and everything.
I do like that.
Do you think, do you think Spectre's ever like, again, like a net gain for these films though? The idea of like, do you think they ever make the idea of this shadowy organisation that hangs over multiple films plots ever really work or pay off? Because I don't think there's any evidence of that in this entire series.
I think there are scenes that work. I like the idea, because in the early films, it isn't specifically Blofeld. They all use numbers and there is an idea that there's an organisation that ties everyone together.
It's one of the things in the books, all the kind of villains have a much more fixed role in the organisation. So as a structure, it makes a bit more sense. Like Goldfinger is the treasurer of the evil organisation, for example.
And so I sort of understand the desire to bring that into the films and have this connective tissue and the idea of this sinister organ. But they don't make enough of it. They were quite self-contained films to begin with.
So I can understand the appeal of them wanting to have this through line in the Craig films. They don't seed it early on because it's quantum to begin with. And then it's like, oh, actually, it's all about this spectre organisation.
That's like a mistake that Marvel would never make. They have someone who has complete oversight of the whole thing and they know how it's all going to fit together. It really does feel like the Bond films, they start a new one and then they're like, right, what are we going to do then?
Which makes it quite hard to make a truly connected piece.
Yeah, which makes it so strange that they decided to even do that in the first place because Casino Royale very much suggests this is going to be a connected ongoing story. And then, yeah, I would say that Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the stewards of Bond, are like producers who are stewards of values, but not plot or character.
They've got an idea of what they think the values of a Bond film should look like, but if they were more on it, they would have been like, okay, here's how this entire, we've got a rough three or four movie plan, here's how this will pay off, and then ideally we'll get the same directors back a couple of times and link this together, which they almost do with Mendes, but obviously he haphazardly throws it together and it doesn't amount to much. Jeremy actually wrote a piece for me on TechRadar about this, about how Daniel Craig's Bond films are serialized, but they don't fit together. I think that's what, it was something like that.
And that's very, very true that, yeah, just no connective tissue there. Yeah, real waffly. I will say, one funny thing.
Do you remember, maybe I imagine this, but do you remember people speculating that Batista was going to play, what's his name? Fucking odd job. Do you remember that?
I was like, like, I'm pretty sure. That's what like people were speculating was going to happen. He'd turn up with a hat, but be a fucking giant man.
Like, I'm, maybe I imagine that.
If they wanted to proper like marvel up these films, they would have had him become, they would have had Christoph Waltz becoming Blofeld, and then they'd have had all these amazing A-lister talent at the end turn up for a mid-credits sting, where it's like, you know, his John C. Reilly is Goldfinger, his, you know, his Tom Cruise is Drax, and it's kind of like, oh shit, they're going to reboot the whole Bond universe.
Yeah, that's like, yeah, that feels like something they might threaten us with next time they do Bond.
Yeah, if I was put in charge of Bond, I would do, I would weave in a bit of that, for sure.
I just don't, I don't know that I ever need these films to be serialised, to be honest. Like, I think I'm fine with them all living in isolation, then on their own terms, they can succeed and they're not weighed down by the others, which is why so many of these Marvel films are shit, because they're all connected together.
Yeah, but I would have a, yeah, I just don't mind the idea of Spectre as like, which person from Spectre is going up against Bond. That's all the connectivity you need. Like, Bond doesn't need to be the same person even, but I like the idea of kind of like, right, your turn now.
Okay, yeah, that's fair. Alright then, well, I'm sure we'll revisit this because we've got loads of Spectre films left to come. Number 15, Thunderball.
A Spectre agent steals two atomic bombs from a NATO plane. James Bond is assigned a mission to recover the warheads and put a stop to the evil plans of the criminal organization. I found this really just dull on a rewatch compared to the...
I feel like there was a decline that kicks in with the Connery ones. They find the formula, then it just goes into decline. But the main problem I have with this one, two things.
The intro, where he gets the jetpack and beats up that guy who is dressed as his own widow at his own funeral. That's fucking dumb.
But then the amount of boring underwater set pieces in the end. It's so, so boring. So I found this a tough hang.
But you have some quite funny things to say about this one too, Matthew, when we're discussing it on Discord. What's your take on Thunderball?
Just to go back to the Spectre thing. Spectre do appear as a shady organisation in this, which I quite like. I think this one is like the most Austin Powers one.
This is the one it feels like Mike Myers was actually riffing on. When he punches the widow and it's actually a man, because there's that gag in Austin Powers with the, it's a man, man, which is just ripped off from that. It's got the chairs killing people in the council.
Just the idea of stealing warheads for nuclear threats. I'm trying to remember what my hilarious take was.
Isn't this the one with the exercise, sorry, the massage bed? And Connery has to, is that this one?
Oh, that right. That's the most undignified bit of Connery. He gets put on this, yes, massage chair at this like health spa and then someone turns it up to Max.
And the idea is it's going to like stretch his spine, but stretch him to death. But like, obviously the machine isn't doing that. And to act this out, he's just having to very aggressively like dry hump a massage table.
And it just looks awful. There's no way Sean Connery, knowing what we know of what Connery was about and like, that he would have watched that and thought, oh yeah, I look cool.
Yeah, I actually like made some detailed notes for these early Connery ones because I had very, very loose memories of seeing them. So for this one I wrote, beating up a man dresses his widow and flying off in a jet pack is the dumbest thing in these films so far. Is this going to be the campus one yet?
Oh, I see. This is the one that inspired Austin Powers the most. Rough optics on Bond kissing his physical therapist against her consent.
Although honestly, again horrified more by Connery's hairy legs. That was like just how hairy Connery is. Just like surprising.
Get in the spine stretching machine, Mr Bond, and he does. After almost dying, he blackmails his physical therapist into having sex with him a moment later. And to think these people reckon these films aren't progressive.
This one wastes loads of time in a health spa, almost 30 minutes, but finally starts to pick up when eyepatch man feeds his lads to the sharks. That is pretty good. I think that's the first time that's in these films.
By this point, Bond already feels rigidly formulaic. I'm not convinced this does anything better than Goldfinger. Indeed, it's just longer and more languid.
I think it's the first one over two hours, this as well. So yeah, that was kind of like my take on it basically. And also the villains were becoming campier.
You kind of noticed that in this one. I think this was actually like a breakthrough film in terms of its success in North America. This was like the biggest one at the time, just absolutely enormous.
And so that might be why this one registered with Mike Myers more than maybe some of the other ones did.
It's also celebrated for some quite groundbreaking underwater action cinematography, which I imagine at the time if you hadn't seen something like that, that would be amazing. But what it actually translates to now is it's just very slow set pieces as people. And there's one where there's like a 10 minute sequence where they reclaim a missile from a crash plane.
And it's just like watching an instructional video about how to do that. Like it's just not interesting at all. And yeah, come the big kind of fight at the end.
Yeah, just too much, too much water stuff in this.
Yeah, I was actually watching it thinking, is there going to be like an underwater base in this? And then it's going to all kind of, that's where this is going. But I was like, no, that's the spy love me.
And like, this is not that film. This is just, there's going to be lots of looking around in water and then lots of fucking harpoon guns firing underwater. And then the film will end and that'll be it.
Yeah, not very good. Or like, it's okay, it's okay. It's just like, yeah, it's going slightly off the boil, the Connery films at this point.
Next up there, Matthew. This is quite high. Maybe this is wrong, actually.
This should be lower. 14, Live and Let Die. Great theme tune again.
James Bond is sent to New York to investigate the mysterious deaths of British agents. On his journey, he meets a voodoo master and a tarot card reader. It's so elementary.
So this film, massively racist. Really strange. So when you read about this, people are saying, okay, it's like reflecting the black exploitation movement in cinema, and that's fine.
But I would say the way it's portrayed makes it just seem like Bond is like a white guy against black person conspiracy. And the film doesn't really have much more to say than that in terms of why anything's even happening in this. He's just basically lured into this kind of world where he's trying to basically rescue this white girl.
Now. It's quite hard to explain exactly. You just have to watch it, and it just gives you a bit of cursed vibes.
But it's got a few bits I quite like. I like the club he goes to that's got all those different tables that flip over and take him into the enemy's lair. Every single table in that place seems rigged to go to a different room, which is quite entertaining.
But do I like anything else about this? I don't know if I do that much. I suppose it's just not quite as boring as some of the other more ones.
What do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, I think that's it really. It just shows you some stuff. It's quite insensitive, obviously, throughout.
I keep thinking about how when I was younger, a lot of these films are your first exposure to other cultures, which may sound mad, given how daft they are. But this was definitely the first time I'd heard about voodoo and the idea... New Orleans and the idea of...
And this sounds really dumb when you say it out loud, but black cultures around the world being different to what we had in the UK, I still think it's like a film that shows you a load of stuff. Maybe it's poorly done and...
You know, very, like I say, wide at the mark in how it depicts all of those places and cultures. But I kind of... I do like it for trying, in a way, of being a different place.
It doesn't look like the other Bond films. It's quite distinctive in terms of the places they go to. Yeah, I think it's OK.
I'm not saying I'm going to put up posters of it on my wall or anything.
Just do a problematic New Orleans film double bill with this and Angel Heart, Matthew. That might be good.
Just part of a giant problematic face.
It'll be very popular here, I think. I actually really dig the bit at the start where there's the fake funeral and they kill the guy and put him in the coffin and the music turns jolly.
That's really good. That's much better than the funeral barge in whichever it won. The one in Venice where there's a funeral barge and there's an assassin inside, he pops out of stock and starts throwing knives at his Bond in the gondola.
In terms of, if we were ranking fake Bond funerals, living that day, that's much higher.
Much higher as well than the dude dressed as his own widow. Definitely better than that as well. Yeah, I don't know.
It's problematic, but it's still entertaining, I would say.
Not boring. Yes, not boring. It's got the henchman with the metal claw.
Is it Teehee? Barry Sammody, obviously. Iconic.
I would say that the henchman in this are probably more notable than the main villain, who's not very interesting. Is it King Kananga or something? I think he's cool.
Who puts on weird prosthetics to disguise himself as Mr X.
Which obviously looked like a guy in disguise as well. Particularly in 4K.
He just comes out with a big rubber face like Gary Oldman is Churchill.
Yeah. Very sort of bizarre. I did burst out laughing at the dumbass death of that villain, where basically Bond puts some inflatable thing in his mouth, then he becomes a big balloon man and pops.
Very silly.
Yeah. Also the script, which, you know, it's like black exploitation, which is obviously aimed at an older audience. And this is kind of the soft version, and you can hear like some very prim and proper screenwriters delicately tiptoeing around which words they can and can't use.
Yeah. I think there's a couple of honkeys. I think they say, they say pimpmobile at one point.
I don't know if they say it, but like certainly they're trying to tap into that world, probably using a lot of dictionaries.
Yeah. It's got big, if once if I had to write a black exploitation film, it would probably sound like this.
I would also say this has like the best Felix Leiter in it as well, who's like the one they bring back later on for license to kill. I like this. He's like the most memorable one, I think.
In my head, this guy so kind of makes such an impression that you, the Felix Leiter here, that I sort of thought he was in more films than he actually is, but he is just in the two. Do you like that? Do you have an opinion on Felix Leiter's, Matthew?
Yeah, I can't say I'm crazy about modern Felix Leiter.
Nah, doesn't do much.
What's his name from Westworld?
Jeffrey Wright.
Jeffrey Wright, yeah. He's just a bit of a drab, isn't he?
Yeah, David Hedison was the one I'm talking about here. He will only appear once 16 years later. Really strange to actually dip back into this one.
And then you only get to really see half of him.
Yeah, spoiler alert. So yes, good. Number 13 then, Matthew, The Living Daylights.
So the first, Dalton one. I think most people probably have this higher than license to kill in their list. James Bond must cross several continents to confront and defeat an arms dealer who is conspiring with a Soviet general to start another World War for profit.
Oh, that's what's going on in this film, is it? Because I had no fucking idea after watching it. Has like a great intro in Gibraltar, Matthew, where Dalton looks fucking amazing as he kind of like parachutes in to this training exercise that turns out to be basically a bunch of his mates being killed.
That's really good.
The other 00s die way too easily in that sequence.
They are chumps, aren't they?
Like given what we know about how adept 007 is, it's amazing that this other guy kills. I mean, they really die in dumb ways. Like he literally cuts one of their climbing ropes and just falls to his death.
Yeah, for sure. Can I actually, do you mind if I read you? Because I think the plot of this film is so confusing.
Someone tweeted at me when I tweeted about this film saying with this letterbox review that actually explains the plot of this film, which I think is so confusing. It's from Matt Lynch on Letterboxd. It's taken me 25 years or so, but I finally actually fucking understand the bad guy's plan in this, and I just want to write it down for posterity.
A Soviet general fakes his own defection to the West and recaptured by the KGB, both to stall for time and to gain Bond's trust in order to trick him into killing a key rival after he is caught diverting state funds meant for an illicit arms deal, which he intends to exchange for diamonds to be traded with the Mujahideen from Opium, which he will then send to Europe, sell into Europe at a massive profit to be split with the arms dealer. That is so complicated. You watched this one recently.
Did you find it quite hard to follow?
Yeah, I felt like this was trying to kind of react to what was the sort of political culture of the time, unsuccessfully. Like, it's kind of gritty, but also just really, really confusing. Like, fundamentally, the villain is some Russian guy and of quite a bad American general played by Joe Don Bake, who comes back as his mate in GoldenEye.
Because there are only five actors, Matthew.
So, that's odd. I rated this one quite low, I think. This really didn't do it for me.
I was struck with how good Dalton was in the role, like I said, but I think the film's so confusing and boring. I don't think the set pieces are particularly exciting. I find the kind of icy Bond girl, the kind of Russian cellist, a little kind of hard to root for as well.
Like, she doesn't have much chemistry with Dalton. Maybe that's like the Dalton era, though. He's not as handsy as more, so it doesn't really matter.
Yeah, he's quite romantic, but he's not super physical in terms of how he... Yeah, he doesn't really project that same energy, does he?
No. I guess the whole story revolves around... The Bond girl is the partner of the Russian baddie, and obviously they don't know he's a baddie at this point, and Bond's using his friendship with him to say, come with me, I'm going to take you to him.
So he's not molesting her or whatever, because she's spoken for by his mate at this point. There's a bit in this film... Did you re-watch this one?
I re-watched this one. I last watched it last November, so I didn't feel like I needed to. But I have a raise to it from my memory.
There is a bit in this film which is basically just a hitman level, and it's absolutely amazing how hitman-y it is, which is where the baddie, like the baddie's henchman, is this sort of strange blonde assassin, breaks into a house dressed as a milkman. He knocks out a milkman, steals a milkman's costume, which is a classic hitman.
Hitman 2.
He knocks a guy out in the kitchen, instantly puts him in a freezer, using basically the freezer hiding animation from Hitman. And then when he finally gets caught out and the scene goes to shit, he starts throwing exploding milk bottles, which has got big I fucked my Hitman run energy.
Yeah, that whole bit is quite a bit of a strange energy to that whole sequence. But yeah, that did cross my mind actually when I watched it. That's almost exactly what you can do in that first big level in Hitman 2, isn't it?
The original Hitman 2.
Yeah, I must have watched this film. Actually, when you watch a lot of these films, something you do take away is IOs, Hitman games, they take so much from Bond, and they are the natural people to make the Bond game, which was the point of our incredibly unpopular second episode.
So maybe in a couple more years, that game will finally surface. I look forward to seeing it.
And then that episode will explode in popularity.
Yeah, suddenly, like, yeah, our Patreon triples. I was just so into your 45-minute James Bond episode. Okay, good.
I've got nothing more to say about this one, because I just think it's kind of confusing, and Dalton being good is the only main takeaway from it, really. There's not loads else to really love about this one, apart from the Aha theme tune, which I really like, actually. That would make my top ten themes.
We already did five, so what can you do?
It's got a secondary sub-theme by The Pretenders, which the bad guy's always listening to on his headphones.
Yeah, it's like the runner's up prize. You either go to the end credits or throughout. OK, next up then, and the other Dalton film is Back to Back Here, License to Kill.
After his friend, Felix Leiter, gets maimed by a drug lord. It's actually a shark, more accurately. James Bond seeks revenge on him.
With MI6 refusing to back him, Bond takes matters into his own hands. So I was 50-50 on this, but License to Kill is just more coherent than The Living Daylights. It's a little bit goofier, a little bit sillier, a bit more violent, kind of like a...
It's more like an 80s kind of Arnie thriller or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so a bit more American feeling, you know?
Only one which is a 15, I think.
Right, okay, yeah. But these days it's fairly tame, I would say, a man being eaten by a shark partially aside.
Yeah, I like the violence, there's that man who gets exploded in the decompression tank.
Yeah, that's really good. And then you see Benicio del Toro getting mashed up in that machine near the end, the drugs machine or whatever it is that mashes up the drugs.
He is a handsome young man.
Yeah, he looks fucking amazing in this. He's also a great bastard, a great sub-boss for Bond to fight, basically. That bit where he's like, don't worry, we gave her a nice honeymoon.
That's a young actor who's like, I've got maybe 10 lines in this film. I have to make myself known. I have to capture the attention of the world.
So how will I do it? By saying honeymoon in a really weird way.
It lands though, it's one of the bits you remember the most. I've got to say, it's again got a load of boring bullshit in the middle with Wayne Newton. It's like a bit in his casino where they're just watching this phone line thing with Wayne Newton.
It's just really fucking dull. Basically, what it needs to do is get to the final Drug Factory set piece a lot faster than it does. Again, a lot of 20 minutes out of this film.
Also, the American girl assassin woman he meets at about halfway through. She's not very good. She's not a very good actress.
The chemistry is definitely not there with Dalton and her. But I don't know. It's like Dalton on the warpath is the best thing about this film.
He's just really angry, properly wants revenge. He's incredibly violent. Him running away from MI6 is pretty rad.
Him kind of escaping.
There are very few Bond films which have like a very neat, easy to sum up plot of like, oh, it's the revenge one, or it's the one where he's fighting the other assassin, or it's this one. I think they're definitely stronger when they actually have a plot outside of what is the villain's plot, which is revenge and what happens if Bond isn't a secret agent anymore and goes rogue.
Yeah, I think the bit at the end where he goes, don't you want to know why, then he shows him the lighter and sets him on fire. It's like Robert Davy on fire is fucking great. That's maybe the best Dalton moment that he gets.
It's just so aggressive and needlessly violent. I really love that. Also, Robert Davy is a proper great shit-eating villain in this.
He's just such a piece of crap. It's not like many layers to him, but you just see how unreasonable he is, how much control he has. It is cathartic when you see Bond finally get his revenge.
I do like the idea of using Felix Leiter as the revenge plot rather than a woman he likes. That's actually quite an interesting wrinkle.
Mrs. Leiter also gets done in.
She has a rough time in this, for sure.
It's also quite goofy at the start when they make that arrest and then they arrive at the wedding. It's a bit Roger Moore-ish in places, this one.
That's why it's quite shocking when it goes from that to he's being fed to a shark.
It's also got Everett McGill from Twin Peaks and various David Lynch things. Absolutely chewing scenery as the corrupt cop watching. When he watches Felix Leiter get eaten by the shark, his facial expressions are definitely overcooked there.
But it is also rad when Bond hits him with a briefcase of money and he falls into the shark tank. That's really good. So yeah, I quite like this one.
I'm surprised that people like The Living Daylights more than this. I think if people went and rewatched them back to back, you'd realise this is the stronger film personally. Okay, moving on then.
Number 11, Tomorrow Never Dies, a Matthew Castle special. James Bond, an undercover agent. Sorry, the descriptions are so bad.
James Bond, an undercover agent, sets out to prevent media baron Elliot Carver from waging a war between China and the United Kingdom after he gets summoned by the Secret Intelligence Service. So Matthew, why do you like this one so much?
I think Jonathan Price is a really goofy villain, but he's in it from start to finish. I think he's a really good through-line in this. I like the pairing of Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh, not from a romance perspective, but she's just such a good action presence.
This film has a couple of quite good action set pieces in it. I like the bit where they jump from the tower and pull down the poster, and I like the bit where the helicopter chases them on the motorbike and chops up the town. I think that's exciting.
Really, I just think this one holds together a bit better than... You know, it is a silly one, but it holds together a bit better than some of the other sillier ones. I have to ask you about Jonathan Pryce's media empire.
It makes me laugh every time he says magazines in this film. Which he says a lot, because obviously at the time, having a big magazine empire would have been impressive. You know, he's got newspapers, magazines, TV, and I guess they're sort of pushing into the early internet.
But every time he boasts about his huge magazine division, it just makes me think of what it would be like to work in that magazine division, and how it just doesn't... You know, just fast forward ten years later, that division would definitely be a problem for Jonathan Pryce's media cover empire.
He's like, I'm losing serious money in this.
He'd be trying to offload it to Feature, probably, is how that would have worked out. Also, his whole plan involves basically engineering a conflict between the UK and China and the South Chinese seas by making it look like the UK Navy has been attacked, and he fakes this attack and then they film it, and he thinks this is the story of the year that a small crisis is in the South China seas, and he says, I want news, magazine stories, books, radio, TV, films, which I just don't think the thing that he's engineered would make a good film. I just cannot see a world where anyone would watch a film about a British Navy frigate sinking in the South China seas.
I think he's a terrible media baron.
Yeah, I've got to say that that entire media baron element is why I don't really like this film. I think it's a bit like Matthew Amaurick in Quantum of Solace, where I mentioned this on the original Bond episode, but I like a villain who gets his hands dirty. And here, him just doing his NAF monologues about the news, just doesn't really do anything for me.
Quite boring when it comes straight after Sean Bean. Just absolutely bananas, kind of like terrorist, former double agent in GoldenEye. He's just so meek by comparison.
It's a scenery chomper, though.
I mean, it sure is. Should we talk about the bit where he pretends to do martial arts, Matthew?
There's a bit where he does some sort of kung-fu noises towards Michelle Yeoh, which is just incredibly racist.
Powerfully racist, as he put it. And I watched it back and it was like, there's a shot of Jonathan Price from behind in that clip. It's like a proper, what the fuck are you doing, my man, kind of element to it.
It's just funny that seeing him now in the crowd. I like Jonathan Price. I'm not dunking on Jonathan Price and I don't want Jonathan Price cancelled for doing a silly bit of whatever he does at the end of Tomorrow Never Dies.
But yeah, it's a bit of an eye-opener. What I think is really funny about that end scene is that the big standoff revolves around whether or not Ricky Jay gets shot. The Magician.
Which is just very funny to me. Where he's like, I'm going to kill Ricky Jay unless you back down. And you're like, what is this film?
Yeah, that really tickled me.
Again, I don't really see, there's not much to divide this between the other two Brosnans in my head. They're all kind of a beast to me. But if you like it, that's fine with me.
I think this is the first one I saw at the cinema. So it just feels a bit special to me. I quite like the start where Bond's trying to get out of that base before the missiles crash into it.
That's quite exciting. I like the car that he drives with his mobile phone. Incidentally, controlling a car with the world's tiniest trackpad on a mobile phone.
No one can fucking drive a car with touch controls. I think Bond is the only person who'd be able to play GTA on an iPad.
That's funny. Yeah, okay. I think this is a fair place.
There's definitely a movement of people on Twitter who talk about Bond who like this film. I know Andy Kelly's a big fan, for example.
Yeah, I'm fond, but it pretty just landed at the right time. Maybe it's unfair of me to put it this much higher above Die Another Day and The World's Not Enough, but... Well, it adds colour to the list, doesn't it?
I think there is a difference.
Okay, fair enough. Number 10 then, No Time to Die, the final Craig film. James Bond is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica after leaving active service.
However, his peace is short-lived as his old CIA friend Felix Leiter shows up and asks for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist...
Which half of him?
The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be a far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond on the trail of a mysterious villain who is armed with a dangerous new technology. Something I think worked up against this film is how overhyped it was, Matthew, because I think it ended up getting something like five or six trailers, because the pandemic happened and they didn't know that was going to happen. I interviewed Lashana Lynch about this film as part of a TechRadar mobile phone tie-up thing in February 2020, and then the film wouldn't come out for another 18 months, maybe a bit more than that.
That was tough. It had been a long time at this point since Spectre as well. It released six years after Spectre, so there's a lot of anticipation.
Everyone knew this was the last Craig one. I just found it quite stodgy and boring and just didn't really dig, did not dig at all, the Rami Malik villain in this, who just did nothing for me whatsoever. Again, it hinges a massive part of the film on Lea Seydoux, and again, we know they don't have chemistry together.
They are kind of like a bickering couple in this. I don't feel the love whatsoever. Then this film makes the fatal decision to have an absolutely fucking rad sequence with Anna de Armas as a kind of like another agent, and her and Daniel Craig have tons of chemistry.
So when it goes back to Lea Seydoux, it's properly like, oh no, this is like, all this does is illustrate the problem more deeply. And then, yeah, the film struggles to have fun outside of that sequence, I would say. And then ends with killing off the main character, oh, how bold, have a fucking round of applause at what such a fucking self-sacrifice, naff storytelling decision that is, did nothing for me whatsoever.
However, I get the impression you like this a lot more than me, Matthew, so why don't you go from there?
I like, as before, I like how it looks. I think it's quite well made, quite well filmed, there's some quite nice shots in it. I think, you know, Phoebe Waller-Bridge famously did a script pass on this.
I don't think it's howlingly funny, but I think there are some funny lines in there, some funnier lines in there, you know, from the Bond series. You know, I think the reason, a lot of people credit her with why the Anadama stuff feels quite sparky and fun, because it's quite an unusual character, and I think she's thought to have written most, like, that scene.
She's got her name on the film. She has to be responsible for all of it as well, and there's no saving that Leia Seydoux stuff. It's all boring.
Oh, no, no, not at all. But I think there are some interesting, like, the opening sequence to this, which is almost like a weird serial killer, slasher film scene in a house, flashback is kind of interesting.
That is good, actually, yeah, I agree with that.
Yeah, I can sort of see, because they do serialise these Craig films, that they want to have a kind of more permanent end on it. I just think, like, the emotional kind of core of what they're trying to achieve really butts head with the very convoluted plot by which they achieve it. That this, that they basically, like, an hour of this film feels like it's dedicated to setting up the idea that there is this poison, which if it's in your bloodstream, you can never remove it, and it only activates if you go near your target.
So all the stuff with Christopher Waltz coming back is basically to show the mechanic of this poison. And the second they do that, you're like, well, we all know that this is ending in tears because of this poison. And that really, like, stinks up the second half of the film.
I just, I really do like the first half of it. I know you don't like the reuse of the On a Majesty's Secret Service cue, but I think there is something quite sort of swooningly romantic about that. It really kind of, I don't know, it really got me in the cinema and I was like, oh, you know, these films aren't films which kind of get a huge reaction out of me, even at the best of times, outside of just simple enjoyment.
So that it did kind of tap into something in places I thought really worked. Rami Malek, very poor, you are right about that. I don't think it's stunning.
It's probably like a three-style film for me, but that was sort of good enough. Annoyingly, Rami Malek's whole deal, he's like this evil botanist with a poison garden, is one of my favourite things from the Bond books. That's in You Only Live Twice.
Where there's a big kind of blow felt, lives in this castle in Japan and has built a garden of poison plants. That's why Bond goes there, because the Japanese government say people keep going to commit suicide in this poison garden, and they want someone to go and shut it down. I always thought that was a really ghoulish idea.
When they introduced this, I was like, oh cool, they're going to be doing the You Only Live Twice stuff from the book. Actually, they just sort of abandon it. There's a lot of stuff in this film which could be good if they just sort of lent into it a bit more, but it's a little bit of everything and sort of a whole lot of nothing.
I completely junk Billy Magnussen from this film as well. I'd chuck him out as undercover US. I don't even know if you need all that whole sequence with Felix Leiter in this.
They just kill Felix off for no real reason either.
It's weird because it's quite similar to the David Harbour character in Quantum of Solace, who's another goofy, weird US agent who sort of has it in for Bond. Yeah. Odd.
An odd beat.
Yeah, very strange. Also, at this point, it's been quite a long time since Felix Leiter was even in the film, so I don't think he was in either of the Mendez ones, was he? He was just in Quantum of Solace and Kisina Royale, so...
I think that's right. Anyway, yeah. Yeah, so, like, yeah, just, again, I think hype was maybe not on this one side a little bit, so maybe I'm being a bit harsh there.
How's that cool sequence where he's going up the stairs, the one-shot sequence where he's beating all those dudes up on that island, that's quite cool.
Yeah, there's some good, like, filmmaker stuff in this, I think. And the bass, even if Ronnie and Alex are weak, his bass is quite a classic Bond villain bass, and a more successful version of that than I think they've done in the Craig films. It felt like a good marriage of Silly Bond and Craig Bond.
Yeah, Evil Tracy Island, basically.
Yeah.
Okay, cool. Number nine, then, is the first Bond film, Dr. No. This seems high, but I actually do like this film.
I watched it again. I had to do a proper refresh on some of these films. It's strangely paced, doesn't quite feel like the other Bond films.
It's much more like a straightforward spy thriller in its first half, but it gets momentum in its second. Oh, I've got to read out the plot. I'll do that now.
So, Agent 007 decides to battle against an eccentric scientist, Dr. No, who is determined to ruin the US space program. For this purpose, he journeys to Jamaica to nip in the bud this megalomaniac peril. Oh, these are so bad.
Yeah, again, this one's like got a couple... It's like a little bit cringe and a bit racist in places. So, Dr. No is super cringe when you meet him.
The funniest thing about this one was the amount of times that Sean Connery is looking for this... You're looking for this agent in this film called Strangways, and the amount of time that Sean Connery goes, Strangways, he says that about 400 times in this film. I noticed that.
But I think this is a really solid first effort. I can see why people would dig this and dig the idea of these as a kind of ongoing adaptation off the back of this. It's got a lot of iconic moments in it.
How's that strange, like, people think there's a dragon, but it's actually just a giant tank that sets people on fire thing. That's quite interesting. It's just a bit anticlimactic when you meet Dr. No, but otherwise I think this is a perfectly fine film.
What are your thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, but basically the same. It's interesting, like, the pairing of this and From Russia with Love are like the two flavors of Bond, and they both kind of get sort of blown up over time. You know, you can either do subtle Bond, which you don't do that often, or you've got kind of, you know, evil layer at the end Bond, which this is like the prototype version of.
I just think they very quickly surpass it with a film we'll talk about in a sec. So it's, he says, like people don't know, it's fucking Goldfinger.
So, yeah, like, you know, I like it. I kind of respect it. I don't really ever have a crazy desire to rewatch it.
The thing that elevates these films above the more ones is that A, Connery is a lot better than more, B, James Bond, that's like really basic. But also there's something about the 60s ones, the production design in the 60s ones that holds up really well. They just look so beautiful.
And it feels like they use a lot more kind of like, sort of like older buildings as settings and just kind of like a, yeah, more of a classic cinema aesthetic to them, whereas they become a bit more amorphous in the 70s. So, yeah, I think all these films still look very beautiful. Yeah, not much more to say about that one, Matthew, so let's move on because we have many more Connery ones here.
So, number eight is You Only Live Twice. An American space capsule supposedly gets abducted by a Russian spaceship. However, as James Bond discovers that Spectre is responsible for it, he embarks on a mission to unearth the motive behind it.
This is a weird one, Matthew, because I think this film is actually mostly bad, but the end set piece, the last third of it, is actually like phenomenal. So it's kind of a weird one. It has all this very problematic Japanese Bond stuff that definitely does not stand the test of time.
But then, yeah, I think massively picks up. The volcano base, the Blofeld's volcano base, is an amazing bit of production design and gives it so much life. I'm assuming you feel similarly about this one.
Yeah, basically. Though, again, a bit like The Living Let Die, the kind of Japan element of it, I always found very exciting when I was younger, and I still like that about it, even though you have to take it with a huge pinch of salt when he disguises himself as a Japanese guy. Obviously, that isn't good, but it's kind of exotic and fun outside of the badness.
Yeah, I think that's probably true. I think your point about this being your first exposure to some of this stuff as a 10-year-old or an 11-year-old living in the UK is kind of true, because where else would you see this stuff?
Yeah, if I had to describe what Japan was like for a long time, it would have been based on the Japan I saw in You Only Live Twice. Even the soundtrack to this film, the plucked strings or whatever, it's burnt into my head.
It? Like, oh, that's the sound of Japan. But that does happen with these films.
Well, careful you don't get yourself cancelled here, Matthew. That wasn't the goal of this podcast.
No, when you were a kid, you've only got the frame of reference you've got. It's not like the internet. I can't go on YouTube and watch a two-hour video of a man walking very slowly through Tokyo with a GoPro.
That didn't exist in whatever, 1994.
I think they'd recast Blofeld very late in the day for this one, I think. The guy they got for it, Donald Pleasence, is really good. He's a perfect fit for the Connery era of Bond.
It is weird you get such a tiny amount of him and they never bring him back. It just seems like the obvious de facto choice to just keep this character playing this character throughout. He makes the voice and everything.
Everything that Doctor Evil is based on is from this version of the character. So yeah, extremely bizarre. But yes, like I said, I think very flawed in a lot of places, but of all the Connery finales, this is the one that lands more than any other by miles and miles.
It's also obviously what the Simpsons Hank Scorpio parody was based on, this base at the end. Cool. Okay, next up then, from Russia With Love, James Bond searches for a Lector cryptographic device that has the potential to wreak havoc in the world and stop Spectre, a secret crime organisation, from acquiring it.
I more think of this one as the one that's got the rad Orient Express bit at the end, Matthew, which I think a lot of people do. That's where a lot of what James Bond is comes into focus when he's dealing with that, basically the villain explaining his plot and then them kind of fighting it out. That whole sequence is rad.
The rest of the film is okay. I can sort of take or leave it a little bit.
Big, big gypsy fight guy.
Yeah, I made notes on this. Weird horny girl fight sequence goes on for ages in this film. The first half of this is a bit incoherent and very slow.
But again, the production design is fantastic. There's like the opening boobs. Sorry, opening boobs.
The opening credits are not... I wrote down the opening sequence are not super good. There's like a lot of ass and boob shaking even by the standards of this one.
It's very, very embarrassing.
I love the opening boob sequences in all of these films.
There's also, like, it's very, very naff James Bond mask at the start of this one as well. That's super lame.
Please don't. I love the pre-credit sequence of this one.
Yeah, it's pretty good. It's just that mask is naff. But then having watched Live and Let Die and seeing the Mr. X mask, this mask is at least good by comparison to that.
I'd say the Bond films, they need to get a new mask guy. I bet the mask guy also made the golden gun.
This is very much the template firming up though, isn't it? I think the spectre agent executing his plan is genuinely good. It has good sinister undercurrents.
It ends with an absolutely bonkers final sequence. That old spectre lady disguises herself as a maid. She tries to kill Bond with a poison knife at the end of her shoe.
She's shot dead in Bond's hotel room. He quips to his lady companion that the theme music kicks into the film ends. It's completely bizarre.
I've just killed a woman in my hotel room. Let's pop out. We're in Venice.
Let's go have a nice time. Do you know what I mean?
I would actually group this in the thing I was saying about license to kill, about a film which has a neat summary. The idea that the Russians have trained a super agent to kill Bond is a really good hook. I think they get distracted from that with a lot of the gypsy stuff.
It just doesn't involve him. I would love a film which is just him clashing with Robert Shaw again and again. Those are definitely the best bits.
I love the opening where it turns out to be a training exercise for Robert Shaw. They're basically like, this guy is going to fucking kill Bond. Then the credit music kicks in.
You're like, god damn, that is a great opening to a film. It just makes me really pumped for what's going to come.
Then the opening boob sequence kicks off.
Then the boobs start shaking. You're like, oh, can this film get any better?
I think the thing which shows the biggest gulf between this and where the excess of the Moore films is if you compare Q and what Q makes in both of them, by the Moore films, the joke is, what has Q put a machine gun in? So Moore will walk through his lab and they'll have a big opium pipe or whatever, which doubles as a machine gun. Where in this one, Q just makes a suitcase with a fucking knife in it.
It's really stripped back and cold. He's like, here's a suitcase. It's got a knife and a gun inside.
And that's it. And you're like, well, this is just a very different era and age. And I dig that.
Yeah, I agree with you that all of that is, all of that holds up quite well, I think, as a kind of like holding the line on the tone somewhat. That's why actually I found Thunderball such hard work because when he gets in the jet pack, you're like, oh, we've lost it now. It's already gone.
You know what I mean? You can't get it back. You can't put it back in the box now.
So yeah, this just kind of holds up very nicely. Yeah, I do like Robert Shaw sort of tracking him throughout the film. That works quite well.
But yeah, the payoff is very good. So yeah, very good film, very good film. Number six, Matthew, is Goldfinger, which is the highest.
We've got a Connery one here. I would have put this above the highest more one, but we'll get to that. MI6 agent James Bond investigates a gold-smuggling ring run by businessman Auric Goldfinger.
As he delves deeper into his activities, he uncovers a sinister plan to attack Fort Knox's gold reserves. The plot is bonkers in this one, and I must admit, watching it recently, I was a bit like, oh, I didn't really get a massive threat level from Goldfinger as a villain. But I must admit, watching some of the later Connery ones made me appreciate this one a lot more.
It also has, obviously, an iconic secondary villain in Odd Job. I dig that. Odd Job, like killing people and driving their cars to, like, the car crusher to have the body smushed is also very, very good.
So, yeah, I think this holds up pretty well, despite the extremely daft plot. It has the laser sequence in it, which is a great bit of tense filmmaking. Generally, the filmmaking is pretty good.
The action is a bit up and down. They hadn't worked out how to edit yet, so Connery is terrible at hand-to-hand combat in some of these early films. By the time they get to Lazenby, they're doing these quick cuts to make the combat really interesting and stuff.
But him fighting Oddjob is like two guys who can't fight, just having a wrestle, basically. Yeah, I dig this. What's your take on this one, Matthew?
For me, this is like the ocarina of time of Bond films. It's just everything you're going to love about Bond, everything's done just right. Maybe I'm a bit over familiar with it now.
Maybe it doesn't excite me as much. The idea of watching Goldfinger doesn't fill me with joy, but I know it's great, and it's just a great, solid, definitive Bond film.
Yeah. Also, I would say that... Forgive me saying this, but Pussy Galore is one of the better female characters in these early Bond films.
It has a surprising amount of agency, and kind of control over the...
Doesn't just get slapped around by Connery.
Exactly. The really dumb thing about the Fort Knox set piece is when the army has to pretend to fall asleep. That's really silly, because they change the gas in those planes.
That's really daft. But yeah, it's real good. That's real entertaining.
I think, like you say, maybe... Again, I will say Goldfinger is a tough hang when you've seen Goldmember. It pulls on the very specific strangeness of that character, I suppose.
It pulls out a few key elements that you can't help but feel seeing in that character when you're watching it back. But he plays it pretty straight. And he is quite ruthless.
I would say he is the most successful of these connery villains. Number five, then, Matthew. On Her Majesty's Secret Service, James Bond sets out on a mission to defeat Blofeld, who hypnotizes beautiful women to fulfill his evil motives.
Meanwhile, he also falls in love with the crime lord's daughter, Jesus. I think they maybe slightly missed the point of this one. We talked about this one quite a lot on that episode we did, Matthew.
So the reputation of this one has greatly improved over time. After they did the connery films, they decided to get Dafter, and Connery was disillusioned with the role. He leaves, so they decide to make this more realistic version.
And the editor, I think, is it Peter Hunt, the editor who directs this one? He was the editor on the previous Connery ones, and it helped to find the pace of these films. So he becomes the director here.
Has loads of things. I love this film. I do absolutely adore this film.
Like the opening sequence with Tracy, the character played by Diana Rigg going into the sea, and then the fight playing out from that. It's quite dreamy, dreamy opening sequence. I love the kind of like the out sort of setting of this.
This, the kind of like, Blayfield's base looks amazing. I think this is probably my favorite Blayfield as well. Teddy Savalas, he's got a sense of physicality and threat that the other ones don't have.
He's not quite as sort of campy and strange. I think that like it's, Lace and Bee feels more vulnerable than Connery did. So this film ends up, the film's plot, where he's like, kind of seems a little bit scared in places, actually fits quite nicely.
The only thing I don't like about it, Matthew, is the bullshit Hillary Bray sequence in the middle, which I would lop out entirely or cut down. But everything works really well. Then, of course, the ending, where Bond actually does get married, does fall in love, does commit ends in tragedy, is an absolute gut punch that still lands every single time I watch it.
It's like absolutely devastating. This is, yeah, this film's reputation has greatly improved, as I say. Do you think that's justified?
Yeah, it's still one of those ones where you watch it and you think, what was the thinking behind this? You know, the idea of passing the torch to a new Bond is difficult in itself. And if anything, you think that would be an invitation to play it safe and just give people the kind of Bond that they know and love, to kind of give them a new Bond and such a strange, like, different world of Bond, where people talk about stuff which isn't just the mission.
You know, people talk about love and relationships. There's that very strange bit where Dinerig's dad kind of lectures him about him getting married and what it was when he fell in love. And it's sort of wistful and completely takes its foot off the Blofeld kind of mission gas pedal to just spend time with characters talking about whatever takes their fancy.
It's very, very odd, but also I do like that romance in it. I think the actions are a little bit undercooked in this one.
Oh, I think the fists really land in this one, like the editing, the quick cutting, fighting. That actually really works for me. Maybe I'm less, maybe the 19 ski chasers.
Yeah, it's the skiing again. I just feel like these films have got loads of skiing because the producers and the actors just wanted to go and hang out in a nice ski resort for ages in between filming, which I imagine they did.
The one I cut is the avalanche that goes off, the one where Bond and Tracy are going down the cliff, and Blofeld is also skiing after them. I'd keep the final bobsled chase.
That's fine. I wouldn't classify that under skiing. I'm not anti-snow, I'm just anti-skiing.
Right. It's interesting how this was turned around. When we were teens, we had no time for this one at all.
I don't think it's one you can necessarily enjoy when Roger Moore is also speaking to you. I think you have to be a bit older to enjoy it. It's a bit more sophisticated.
It's even more romantic than the Craig ones when he's a bit more vulnerable.
I'd also really love the way that Bond goes off to Blofeld's place undercover, and then he has to escape. Then Tracy, who hasn't been in the film for about 20-30 minutes at that point, suddenly just reappears and is part of the plot. It works really well.
Then it just means that they managed to land the final moment really, really well.
The more I watch it, the more I think he's good and could have been great if given the time. But obviously it helps that Diana Rigg is an excellent actress and it really elevates the film. And like Telly Savalas, as I mentioned, he's also excellent.
Lacey B was like a laughing stock to me as a kid. I was like, oh, it's so lame. He was only one film because he was rubbish kind of thing.
And then, yeah, like you say, you need to be older to appreciate it. And then your opinions change a bit when you see those more ones back to back. And you kind of wonder as an inflection point, what if this film had been mega successful?
What would 70s Bond have looked like?
Instead it's Sean Connery and Don Zofrela. And you never think, oh, this is a man whose wife has just died.
No, he's like, he goes, goodbye Blofeld in the start and then like, dugs him into whatever that bubbling liquid or whatever he is, he dies in the start. And like, yeah, it's just completely just ignores it basically. So yeah, a strange one, but obviously has left its mark because they had to steal a big bit of it and for no time to die in order for it to have any emotional resonance.
So, but maybe I'll make a cynical take there. Number four then Matthew, the spy who loved me. I know it's a big Matthew Castle favourite.
After the Royal Navy Polaris submarine carrying 16 nuclear warheads mysteriously disappears, James Bond teams up with Major Anya Amisova, whose lover he had killed in Austria. So this one, there was like a three year gap between this and the man with the golden gun, which they thought he was going off the boil. So they took their time to get it right.
And I think it results in maybe one of the, definitely one of the most confident blockbuster bonds that they made. A perfect fit for Roger Moore and a really interesting dual agent storyline where Russia and the UK basically have to team up in order to overcome this villain. Has jaws in it, has that rad underwater base, has like a fantastic underwater set piece as well with the car.
Just fucking phenomenal. I watched it yesterday and had a great time. Amazing opening sequence with the parachute and the ski chase.
Fucking great, Matthew. Thoughts?
Yeah, absolutely a complete agreement. I think this really, really holds up. The stunts are really exciting.
The set pieces are really imaginative. All that stuff I kind of reacted to, obviously, as a teenager, very positively. What I don't think I appreciated is, like, the Bond girl in this is really good.
Barbara Bach, she's really good in this film. And she has a role. Like, she's through the whole film as well.
You know, it's the idea of, like, Bond and his Russian counterpart kind of going on an adventure together gives this film just a lot more shape than a lot of the other more ones. It's kind of, you know, East and West together versus this mad bloke who wants everyone to live under the sea. Which it just shouldn't work.
It is as stupid as all the other Roger Moore ones. But it's just funny how these little tweaks really land it. And Jaws is, like, just a brilliant device.
You know, he looks terrifying. He actually does bring, like, a proper strand of horror to it. Like, he's filmed, as you would a slasher film.
Like, Michael Myers, basically, when he's stalking them around the pyramids. And then when he turns up again, like, in her cupboard on the train.
That's a genuinely scary moment, that is. Like, you don't expect it, and there's a horrible scream sound that kind of, like, loud train noise behind it, and it really makes you jump, I think.
Yeah, I would say a tough break for the other henchmen who gets introduced at the same time as Jaws. Sandor, who is just a very heavyset man, who gets tired running up some stairs and then pushed off a roof. You know, there's a reason we aren't unlocking him as a character in Golden Age.
Yeah, just the globe, the world looks amazing. You know, all the different places they go to, Egypt, and driving the Lotus Esprit around Sardinia looks like absolutely incredible Forza Horizon 2 DLC. A lot of time for that.
Actually, the role of Jaws in this film made me think, in the Bond game Iowa making, Jaws as an unstoppable Mr. X-style character.
Oh, that'd be rad.
He's just someone who's pursuing you constantly. That would work as a mechanic, I think.
Or like, he's like a modifier. You can add to an existing level. So when you go back and replay, you add Jaws.
So he's just jumping out of cupboards.
You just have to complete the objective, but Jaws is also there. That would be really cool. Like Jaws mode, that'd be good.
You and I could definitely... It's funny, on that Bond episode, you and I spend a long time coming up with what that entire game is. Yeah, so...
No doubt we have plenty of ideas for that one. Yeah, so I kind of agree with all of that. I should correct myself, actually.
This is the film that has the Lawrence of Arabia music in it, not For Your Eyes Only.
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.
It's funny as well, when you read about Barbara Back, every single comment says, I cannot believe she married Ringo Starr. Which is really harsh on Ringo. I'm sure he's very nice.
I mean, literally one of the most famous men in the world. I mean, come on.
Yeah, he's aged very, very well. Yeah, so I think all of that stuff works. It actually shows that if you put the time and effort into making sure every bit of the filmmaking actually lands, it doesn't matter that Roger Moore's otherwise not a particularly great Bond, if everything else around him kind of works.
Yeah, again, has the magic of a boat stealing a submarine, which is preposterous, but works really well. The final set piece on that boat is really, really good. I'm sorry, the underwater base is really good.
Yeah, it's a kind of shame that they do bring Jaws back and kind of waste them, but what are you going to do? Yeah, everything about this is just like, yeah, all the right pieces are in place, you know? Yeah, great stuff.
So, number three, Matthew, GoldenEye, the highest Brosnan one by miles here. Agent 007, along with Natalia Simanov, travels to Russia to locate the satellite nuclear weapon stolen by Alek, a former agent who Bond believed was dead. That is so incoherent as an explanation of this plot.
So yeah, again, like this, a long hiatus due to legal issues between license to kill and this. Dalton kind of resigns from the role. He was probably slightly too old by the time the mid-90s rolled around.
So they get Brosnan, who looks fucking amazing in the 90s, he's an extremely handsome man, and do this really interesting plot where basically Bond leaves his friend slash MI6 colleague to die, and then it turns out he's not dead, and he is actually like the main villain behind the plot of this film. That works really well. Good post-Cold War Bond, with remnants of Mother Russia kind of vibes to the villain.
And lots and lots of great set pieces. I think you have to speak to this film's strengths.
From the jumping off the dam, obviously, to the slow creep in the gas canister room with Orimov and Bond escaping right at the start, to the tank in St. Petersburg. It's full of great set pieces. Matthew, I know this is one of your favorites.
Yeah, yeah. Impossible to untangle from the video game and how important that was. Brosnan is the gamer's Bond.
I'd say it's still silly Bond, but it has a flavor which is completely distinct to Brosnan. It's jokey, but it isn't too jokey. It's stern where it needs to be, but it isn't too stern.
It's just a very specific balance that they never ever find with Brosnan ever again. I think he leans more and more, Roger Moore, post this. Everything is a bit daft.
Really, every line with Brosnan is a gag after these films, but this isn't the case. He just looks great. He's the right age for it.
Everything feels iconic, and I don't think that's just because of the video game and having spent so much time with these specific characters. But like Xenia on the top, classic. Boris, absolutely classic.
I'm invincible. Come on, people were saying that in the playground for years.
Oh yeah, Alan coming with a Russian accent is like an underrated part of why this film works, I think.
Yeah, it's really great. I think the actual plot at the heart of it isn't brilliantly strong, but the character work and the actors they have and the execution of the action where they have it is really exciting. That dish at the end is just a really spectacular location as well.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this isn't just nostalgia for the video game talking. I'm pretty sure this is just a good action film and a great Bond film.
I think 30% of it is the game, personally. You can't deny the texture it adds to all these different scenes and locations you see for a minute. They become entire levels you spend years in.
But I definitely think it's clear, far and away the best, Brosnan 1. It was the perfect Bond for that moment when it really needed a shot in the arm. Sean Bean is a great villain as well.
Lovely girl. Tastes like strawberries. That's a top shitty villain line.
Very, very good. I like the dual element. It's a triple threat between Orimov, Xenia and Alex Trevelyan.
They're a good trio of villains. That observatory or whatever they used for that final set piece is terrific. I think that's collapsed in recent years, that whole, like, the cold cradle bit.
Yeah, it fell onto Alex Trevelyan. Didn't you see the film?
So yeah, big fan, big fan. You can get a little bit of Robbie Coltrane and inexplicably Joe Don Baker works at the CIA now.
Back from the dead, this time as your friend.
There are only five actors. They had to make do with what they have, Matthew. Okay, top two.
Number two, Casino Royale. Special Agent James Bond embarks on a mission to prevent LaCheif, a mob banker, from winning a high-stakes poker game. He is aided by Vesper Linde, a British Treasury agent.
Must have missed the Treasury bit, to be honest. So yeah, like a real kind of like cut back, so back to basics, responding to perhaps slightly unfair criticism of Die Another Day or at least exaggerated criticism to make this very realistic, born-infused Bond film. Matthew, how did you feel watching this at the time?
As someone who was paying close attention to Bond in the cinema?
I loved it. I was so pleased because so much shit was talked about Daniel Craig being Bond. There was so much hate towards him from like the dumb press.
You know, you're kind of tabloids. I do remember, and this is a very like of its time reference, Chris Moyles had like a huge anti Daniel Craig campaign, which I think was called Bond Not Blonde. Like his beef was that that Bond was blonde.
He was like, you can't have a blonde Bond. And then that he turns along and basically turns Bond into like a powerhouse film franchise again. It was such a good fuck you to all the idiots.
And that's not a reason to love a film, but it's, you know, it's part of it for sure. Yeah, like he was thuggish and different, but you also see the formation of the character. I love the pre-credit sequence where just really succinctly shows his two kills he does to get his double A status.
He has genuinely brilliant chemistry with Eva Green, probably some of the best chemistry of any Bond and Bond girl.
Amazing.
And, you know, there's very few Bond films where the best scenes aren't like the action scenes or the set pieces, but in this, like, the chat between them on the train is like an all-timer, I think, where they're like sizing each other up and kind of getting to the heart of each other, I think, it's just, like, it's really, it's well-written, well-acted. It's a thrill. Like, weirdly, rewatching this one, I actually think the big problem with Casino Royale is it's the card game itself, I think, is not very well filmed and not very exciting and not entirely clear of, like, if you don't understand poker, it's basically impossible to follow.
Like, you have to wait for everyone's reactions to know whether or not something's good has happened to Bond or not. Which, given that it is the central set piece, and quite boldly so, like, I like that they stretch it out and there are, like, action beats, like, around this card game. That's something which didn't really...
You know, I didn't really have a problem with that, but rewatching it, I was like, oh, it's actually isn't... As a thriller scene, I don't think this is very good. But I know that you had more beef with their aeroplane, right?
Yeah, it's just that that feels like the biggest, like, bit of a film I didn't really need when Bond's, like, in the airport and there's, like, a, you know, like that chase sequence, just like a race against time. I didn't see what the point of that was or why it was terribly relevant to the plot. That's why I...
Because they needed to show Richard Branson.
That's how I felt last time I watched it. It was the one set piece I'd forgotten was in the film.
Right.
Because I just... Because it felt redundant to me. Like, I didn't think you needed it among everything else, but maybe they just felt like they needed one more large-scale sequence.
Am I wrong? Is there a plot-relevant reason that's in the film? I can't remember.
Well, the whole thing is that Schieffer's trying to blow up that plane to tank the stocks. It's the fact that the plane doesn't blow up and all his shorted stocks fail on him and he ends up in debt. That's why he has to play the card game.
But the third act of that film is just setting up that Mads Mikkelsen loses money and has to play a card game, which you didn't need to do two extensive set pieces to set that up. Even though I love the parkour chase across the building, so I've not got a problem with that. But yeah, and I'm not saying like the card game, you obviously need the card game.
It's at the heart of the film. I just, I feel like in the hands of maybe like a better like thriller director, that could be a truly killer bit of that. Like I thought Casino Royale was my favorite Bond film, but rewatching it, I was like, it's a little bit weaker than I remember, which is why it didn't quite make the top for me.
I felt the same way as well. It took, last time we rewatched this, I thought, I wish this like, I wish I felt the way about this still, that I felt about it in 2007 when I watched it for the first time. Like, this is just such a punch out of nowhere.
Like I was just so, so into that Daniel Craig version of Bond. I think like a lot of people, you know, say that the film Layer Cake is a big reason why Craig got his break and that's well worth watching, I think, in tandem with these Bond films. It's a kind of like evolution of the actor.
Do you like that film? It's real good, I think.
All I remember is Michael Gambon going, Welcome to the Layer Cake.
Well, Michael Gambon's really good in that film, but Craig's like kind of a proto Bond, except he's like intellectual money man Bond who has to get his hands dirty. I think you just see a lot of the character, what would become the character forming in that film. Really, really good, really entertaining.
Often on, you know, fucking Prime or Netflix or whatever just pops up for like six months and goes away again. So yes. Yeah, like just, yeah, it doesn't quite hit the same way, but obviously has another kind of like devastating ending.
But because it gives like so much screen time to Eva Green, it means that it doesn't feel like kind of ruthless or tropey that they just kill her off to motivate the main male character. It feels like they are in that moment very much so.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, good. All right. Plus it has the bit where he has to, he has to use the defibrillator on him.
That's quite thrilling, isn't it? That's pretty exciting. That's like the most, that's probably the biggest leap they take with the tech in this, isn't it?
That he's got a defibrillator in his fucking car.
Yeah, because he doesn't, they don't really reintroduce the proper gadgets. You know, Q's not even in it until Skyfall, so.
Yeah.
They kind of, they skip all that stuff. I just, I like the little, I like the messiness of the fight in the toilet at the start. And I love that the traditional Bond shooting down the barrel is him shooting the guy in the toilet.
I thought that was a really classy touch.
Yeah. I also, and I did like the Chris Cornell opening theme to this, so that was pretty good. Pretty, you know, very different to represent the different take on Bond.
I also think that if I was to level one, Chris, one more criticism at the Craig films overall, is the slow creep of like extra MI6 characters I don't really care about. There's just too many of them by the end. It's really simple.
When it's stripped down to just like M and Bond in this film, I think it works incredibly well. And then it's like, I don't need Tanner, you know, in it.
Tanner's in the other ones as well, I think. I think he's in some of the...
More ones...
.Pierce Brosnan ones.
Yeah, no, Tanner has appeared before, but you've got like Inspector when they're breaking into the headquarters and it's like M and Q and then Moneypenny and then I think like maybe Tanner's along for that, I can't remember.
Tobias Menzies is in this one as well. It's just an unnamed underling for M.
Yeah, who I feel like gets market corrected by Tanner, right? Like it just bumped from the line up. So yeah, I don't really like that.
It becomes a bit too much of an all the gangs all here thing and I actually really did not dig Ray Fiennes in that role. Like I much preferred the Judy Dench version of that character. So yeah, that's also what I like about this.
Just so it's stripped down in every way and it works very well. So number one, Matthew. Skyfall, an ex MI6 agent steals a hard drive with top secret information to carry out a vendetta on Bond's overseer, M.
Bond must face this past in a bid to try and save M. Watch this one again this week. Fucking amazing.
Like, if not a five-star film, very close. Like one of the best modern action films has that sense of physicality to the set pieces that only comes from filming them in real life, like you say. Shot by Roger Deakins, who is obviously revered amongst like film Twitter heads, but is obviously exceptional.
And some of the kind of color correction on these sequences makes the shots kind of so memorable. Fantastic. And like a brilliant villain as well.
Like a truly great villain who is intertwined with the plot perfectly. Is used sparingly, Javier Bardem's, well I forgot his name, Raoul Silva, that's it. Just really kind of twisted, really good.
Great set piece in London. Great kind of like weird sort of like base that he's got. Kind of like scenes as well that are incredibly tense.
Ridiculous monologue where he introduces himself and talks about the rats on the island, Matthew. Mommy was very bad. So yeah.
Now they only eat rats.
It's that mouth noise he makes. That's just tip top. Sam Mendes Bond.
I'm guessing Matthew that you also adore this. Do you think this is a worthy number one?
Yeah, I really rate this. I think this is what happens when you get like a really legit director and let them make something a bit sillier than they would maybe make under their own steam. He's spoken at great length about how much he loves James Bond growing up and he was a big fan.
Not to knock the other directors, obviously Martin Camel directed GoldenEye and Casino Royale, both absolutely amazing. I just think this visually structure, I think there's so much imagination which feels like it comes from the director. Within the set pieces, there are so many little mini ideas, just that opening sequences, there's multiple vehicles in the chase and the bit where he uses the digger to smash up the train and then get shot off by Moneypenny.
It's really good thriller making and he's a surprisingly good action director, Sam Mendes as well. I think it's quite clear, quite easy to follow. I rate it for that.
Great villain, great central kind of power triangle between Silver, M and Bond. I know some people have a problem with the third act and the fact that it kind of goes to the countryside for like a weird sort of home alone sequence.
Yeah, like a hoard mode basically.
Yeah, but you know, I kind of like that it messes with the structure of it. I like that the big villain's layer is actually in the middle of the film. That they go to that weird island and meet him.
It's really striking the location and the music super sinister. And it just does everything slightly out of step with the other Bond films. It just feels like someone's having real fun with it.
Yeah, just super, yeah, just really, really classy.
There's absolutely what the Craig films needed after Quantum of Solace as well was like time taken to get the next one right, you know? To swerve back to like, it also, it does reintroduce some of the classic Bond elements like the gadgets without it being too much, you know?
Yeah, and he gets like a little radio, I think, isn't that the gadget he gets? He's like super unimpressed. Yeah, but it's also interesting for like, not really having a Bond girl.
You know, there's the, well, the incredibly beautiful kind of owner of the sort of casino in, is it Macau that they go to at the start? Who gets like offed rather unceremoniously. But then after that, like, they always say M's the Bond girl in this one, don't they?
Because it's about their relationship with her.
Yeah, the term Bond girl generally is a little bit loaded, isn't it? That's why I've not really used it much on this podcast. But like, yeah, it is true.
Actually, I really love the change of scenery and pace of that last sequence, because by that point, you've already had breathless, you know, a breathless train chase and a breathless chase through London as well. Like mega populated kind of like areas, busy feeling set pieces. I think you need that switch up at the end to really bring it to life.
And I think because you still have the unresolved element of silver as like a threat, it means there's a real sense of danger to it still. And it doesn't ever become not fun either. Like the funniest spit I found in the last bit was when the Aston Martin gets blown up and then Bond just goes like bonkers off the back of that, just incredibly upset by his car being destroyed.
So yeah, it doesn't lose a sense of fun. And yeah, it lands the characterisation really well of Bond being aging, failing the accuracy test which Silver used against him and stuff like that. Just a real perfect mix of things.
And doesn't have anything like the airplane set piece in Casino Royale that feels redundant to me. It earns being over two hours and it might be the only Bond film that does.
Yeah, I'd agree with that. The only thing which jumped out at me as being a bit naff was Silver's terrorist screen savers that he sends to people with cackling gifs. That stuff never ages well.
Cyber terrorists and the fact that they always seem to have these quite elaborate JPEGs pop up on people's computers.
They look like games you would play with your Sky Remote. That kind of energy to them. Yeah, that dates.
The way women are treated in this film is pretty rough even by the standard of Bond films. Moneypenny gets demoted to basically being a secretary. Although she is in the field through most of this.
You mentioned basically Raoul Silver's hostage slave severing. She gets a really rough hand. And then M is replaced by a dude.
Women get a tougher hand.
Yeah, I didn't really read it like that. But when you say it out loud, you're like, oh yeah, it's not great. It's almost like a twist that she's Moneypenny, isn't it?
Yeah, it is. I think they hold it until the very end basically. But she's like really good.
I think her in the field with Bond more would actually have maybe brought the last two films to life a little bit. But they just don't have the confidence in that character, which is unfortunate. Okay, good.
We've wrapped up, Matthew. Any closing thoughts or are you all bonded out?
Well, I'm certainly bonded out. I need a lot of work for two and a half hours of Pod, but hopefully it was worth it. I enjoyed talking about it.
I've definitely enjoyed our DMs these last few weeks because it's just been an exchange of sort of baffled reactions to whatever terrible piece of race was happening at any given moment, which was fun. And I don't think we went too partridge. It is very partridge-y doing a Bond Rankings episode.
I know that.
We're always so self-aware about this stuff. I feel like it never comes across as too much. Also, it'll be a lot easier when we do the Mission Impossible films next year, Matthew, because those are just like seven or whatever, so we can just fire through those, no problem.
I love those. I hope you enjoyed this episode of the podcast. Thank you so much for your support.
Almost 600 people supporting us on Patreon. Matthew bewilders me as that number grows, but I'm very grateful. Fun to do this.
We'll probably avoid list features of series that have more than 20 entries in future, just for time management purposes.
You've got a DC Extended Universe in you. I haven't seen Aquaman, for example. I'm not sure I can force that.
Crap, Adam. I'm not watching any films of the Rock for this podcast. No amount of money can make me do that.
We'll be back next month. The XL episode next month might need a bit of workshopping, before we properly commit to what it is, which we can do after this call. But the XL episode is going to be Best TV Shows of the Year, so that should be really fun.
Thank you for your support, and we'll be back soon. Goodbye.
Bye bye.
