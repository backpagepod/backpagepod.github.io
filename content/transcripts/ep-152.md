Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we're joined by another special guest. Our guest this week is Dave Scarborough, former Features Editor on Gamestm and Xbox One Magazine, X1 Magazine rather, where he was a Deputy Editor until he ran it into the ground. He's now working on the game Nightingale by Inflection, which is headed up by Aaron Flynn, formerly of Bioware.
Dave, how's it going? I just wanted to make that run into the ground joke in advance, so people know that you and I have got an informal sort of repartee, but how are you doing?
I was doing fine until you said that. Honestly, that was, just came out of nowhere, though. Yes, I certainly did run it into the ground.
I'm doing good. How are you both?
Yep, okay. Yeah, I've had about five hours of sleep, so sort of precarious. Matthew just saw, what did you see last night, Matthew?
Lost in the Stars, a Chinese thriller at the Bath Film Festival.
Yeah, so just sort of doing our respective things, basically. I was reading comics in bed, Matthew was doing that. Pretty happening Saturday night.
What have you been up to, Dave?
On point, I was reading the Joanna Robinson book about the making of the MCU, which is kind of fascinating, digs into a lot of details of the production on the various films. Yeah, sounds very cultured, obviously, but as I say, very on brand for me.
Yeah, the funny thing about that is I had that book, because Spotify does a certain number of hours of free audio book now, and I listened to that book until I ran out of three hours. But the good thing is it's just got to like phase four, and so they've run out of good Marvel films anyway. So I'm like, yeah, I can stop listening to the book at this point.
That's fine, actually. So that's all right.
So you tuned out about the same time, you just stopped watching the films?
Basically, yeah. Like we got to like She-Hulk, and I was like, well, you know, I sort of like, I didn't watch this, and I forgot to watch Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania, so I can move on with my life.
Is Joanna Robinson doing the audio book?
No, she does like an intro bit for it, but then it's like some rando dude.
I'll ask her, otherwise it might just sound like a podcast. You're listening to another Ringer podcast.
Yeah, but which I was actually fine with. That's part of why I listened to it. I thought, okay, this will just be the thing I listen to all the time, but yeah, alas.
It's a good book, though. It's got some interesting behind the scenes details. You can tell she maybe struggled to get sort of like super hot, more recent directors and stars to talk about it, but she's got a couple of producers who like spill the tea, as it were.
That's the first and last time you'll ever hear that on this podcast, by the way.
Does she explain what happened with Edgar Wright in Ant-Man? Does anyone know that yet?
Yeah, that's, Dave, do you want to talk about that? That's like the best chapter, isn't it?
Yeah, that's probably the best chapter because I think that's one of the more unknown areas of sort of Marvel history, like what occurred there. Because he was working, it turns out he was working on that film for something like 10 years and there was various sort of back and forths, different producers involved. And essentially when he had a version of the script that was about six years old or something like that, and it was way before all that connectivity between the various characters and films was sort of insisted upon.
Well, really, to be fair to Marvel, they hadn't realized when they initially brought Edgar Wright on board that that's what they were gonna do with these films. And so by the time it came to the production or getting ready for production for Ant-Man, they were like, well, this has to tie into civil war. It has to sort of make reference to things that have occurred in the previous films.
And rather underhandedly, they hired another screenwriter, unbeknownst to Edgar Wright. And he rewrote the screenplay to include various elements from other films. And Edgar Wright just said, I'm not having that, walked away, made Scott Pilgrim.
Or did he make Scott Pilgrim? No, he made Baby Driver after that. And then Paul Rudd and Adam McKay, Adam McKay of Don't Look Up.
I don't know why I said probably the least popular of the three mature films he's made. But yeah, the one about the money, the one about the vice president makes those ones.
Vice and big short, yeah.
That's the ones. And gosh, that really does make me sound like a layman who only knows Marvel movies. He came along and rewrote the script.
And then yeah, they just hired Peyton Reed to direct it.
And far superior director, I think we'll all agree.
Oh, absolutely.
So yes, okay. That's like a good segue, I suppose, into the subject of this episode, which is about Marvel's Spider-Man 2. It's just released on PlayStation 5.
It's the big PS5 game for the year. Dave is a big superhero head. And Matthew has finished the game.
Dave has finished the game. I have not because I'm pathetic. I chose to watch Silence by Martin Scorsese instead for another podcast we did.
That's my life there. Embarrassing, really. But it's gonna be good.
Dave and I used to work together. We, you know, Dave's one of my best friends just to be, give people a bit of context. So we are, you know, we've got like, we've known each other for years and got a bit of history.
So I think it's gonna be fun to have you on, Dave, talk about this, then we'll transition to Spider-Man in section two. Again, reading out the sort of podcast plan on the air as a form of entertainment, great stuff. So Dave, why don't you tell us a bit about your games media career?
Did you get started writing for Empire?
Yeah, kind of. So I think it would be a surprise to no one who knows me that my interests were more into movies than games. Although I played a lot of games, it was a sort of formative pastime of my youth.
And yeah, so I was kind of writing stuff for blog sites, one called Heckless Bray, where I met another fellow Imagine alum, Ian Dransfield. And yeah, I was just doing film reviews, trying to like sneak into press screenings. It was, I was like 20 years old and I think I got into a press screening at the IMAX at the dark night.
And that was like an incredible moment for me. It felt like I'd sort of broken past like a VIP barrier when, as anyone who's been to those press screenings, aside from the movie, they're not that prestigious an affair. But yeah, I was doing a bunch of blog stuff and then I was trying to become a journalist, essentially a film journalist and there was no jobs going around.
It was hard to sort of break in. So I started writing about games on the side and then with the enough empire, accepted my internship application and I ended up doing a week there. And James Dyer, who was sort of like this fantastic sort of mentor for me, he came over to me and I was just sitting there.
Probably, I think I was probably just like licking stamps or something to send issues out to celebrities. You had like a big like address book of famous people in LA and you just had to like personally like slap the stickers on and send them out to those. Anyway, he came over and said, oh, I hear you write about video games.
I was like, oh, yeah, I do. He said, oh, can you write a preview for Iron Man 2 in the next hour so we can put it in the issue? I was like, okay, I haven't played it.
He's like, okay, well, it's fine. Just work it out and I'll fill in the blanks because I have. I did it and he came back to me and was like, that was great.
Do you want to write for us?
I was like, yeah, obviously, that it blew my little brain at the time. From then on, I was just sort of freelancing for them, going off to various different industry events like E3, Gamescom, covering various other one-off press trips. The first one I did was for Final Fantasy Online, Final Fantasy XIV, right?
XIV.
Yeah.
Yeah. You're a big MMO guy and a big Final Fantasy guy.
Yeah. Definitely a crossroads of my interest there. I met Ashley Day on that trip, actually, funny enough.
Yeah, I got to meet people and then I started to get more work in various different video game publications. That eventually led my way to Games TM when I applied for a staff writing position. But yeah, Empire was fun.
The good thing about Empire was that once you're in the inner circle there and you're trusted, and you're relatively personable, which I think counts for a lot for them, they'll just put you in front of celebrities as well. So I used to go to all of their movie cons and the Empire Awards and I used to chaperone various celebrities and just help out with them. That was pretty cool, just having to hang out with some famous people.
Who's the best celebrity you've chaperoned?
The best celebrity I've chaperoned. But isn't there a bit of K-Fave with this Dave, but you can't really talk about it, is that a thing?
No, I won't talk about the things I won't talk about. That's fine. There's definitely something I did that I wouldn't repeat on here.
That sounds really bad. It wasn't. It's just that there's just certain things you shouldn't do in terms of talking to people and stuff.
Dave, before we get into this, you'll appreciate this. We had Simon Cardion last week, and we talked about when I was at San Francisco in that bar with you, and then Josh Sawyer turned up. We told that story, but without the key detail that makes that story, that story makes no sense.
But you know that story. I know. I was sat there with you.
Yeah.
I'm glad that we're still bringing up this annoyingly ambiguous story for the listeners.
I'll tell you offline, Matthew. It's fine. You know that, Matthew, don't you?
Yeah.
Basically, there was a big celebrity at one of these events, and I went and spoke to them, which was a bit of a no-no. But the person was very gracious, and I was a little bit caught up in the moment. But there we go.
That's what the story was. Feel free to cut that because it's not that interesting to be telling you of a non-story.
Did you talk to whoever this person is? Did you talk to them about Pillars of Eternity? I think you did, right?
No, no, no. I can talk about that one. I'm happy to talk about that.
That one's fun. Anyway, that wasn't someone I chaperoned. In terms of chaperoning, I chaperoned Rich D.
Grant, who was a little spicy, but was okay. I chaperoned Jonathan Ross, who was okay, nice enough.
He's a gamer, right?
Well, this is the thing.
I was like, oh, I hear you're a subscriber of Retro Gamer, I've been told. And he went, am I? And I was like, okay.
And that was pretty much the interaction I had with him.
Good story.
But his wife, Jane Goldman, acclaimed screenwriter, was fantastic. I chatted to her for a long time and their daughter. And who else have I chaperoned?
Ellie Goulding was the best one, weirdly enough. She was just, I mean, I'm a dweeb. And being able to hang around with someone like Ellie Goulding and who's just chatting with you, just being really sort of funny and kind of interested in who you are is kind of a bit rare when you have these celebrity encounters.
And I remember at one point she was like, oh, can I hold your arm as we walk around just to give you some balance? And I was like, yeah, sure. So I was just walking around this event arm-in-arm with Ellie Goulding, and I'm just like, I just melted.
You have a lot of anecdotes like that, though, Dave. Not all of them are appropriate for the air, but you've got stories like that coming out of the Wessu. Yeah, yeah.
So I mean, there's this thing that I read many, many years ago, which was a quote from Bryan Cranston, which is that as he became more famous, he became aware that there needs to be a curfew for him and other celebrities, because you go to an event, like when I'll be at the Empire Awards, and he said, 7, 8 p.m. people being very friendly, and they may just sort of brush past you and be like, oh, Bryan, I really loved your performance in Breaking Bad, have a good evening, that sort of thing, very brief encounter, very pleasant. And he says, but you get past 10 p.m.
and that's when someone from like 100 yards across the room will go, fucking Heisenberg, come over here. They're just like grabbing around the neck. And then he said, as soon as one person does it, it's a free for all.
And you just can't enjoy your evening. He's like, and he was like, you know, I appreciate the feelings that people have for me, you know, and you know, that people want to talk to me, but you know, once I've had a few drinks, it gets a little too much and I have to exit. So he says, I have a 9.30 cutoff and I leave.
And you think that they'd be in a room with so many famous people that it would dilute that because you'd be like, there's 200 people I could drunkardly shout out here. And so it would sort of spread the pain amongst them.
Absolutely not. If there is, cause what you see is just like a hierarchy of celebrity at these events. So like if you're on the sort of upper echelons of that, then you're like a lightning rod.
Like you just attract everything towards you. So the one sort of a weird one that I had was I was, yeah, at an Empire Awards after party. And usually at these things, the celebrities sort of go off in a sort of a corner, which is sort of a VIP area that's not really roped off, but that's where you, I remember just seeing like a whole bunch of people like Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis and a few others, just all just sat together and no one really disturbs them.
They're in a corner. So usually they're not sort of mingling with, the publicists and the marketing people and the hangers-on who managed to get a ticket for a friend. They're all in like a different area of the party, just getting drunk on free booze and whatnot.
And much to my surprise, I've never seen Henry Cavill just stood at the bar in this more sort of relaxed area. And he's just on his own and he's just sort of standing there and looking into the crowd, smiling. Honestly, sometimes I was like, he looks a bit lonely.
Maybe he just needs a friend. So I wander over to Henry Cavill, who's a hulk of a man. We're three big lads, but he's a big lad.
He's got some density. And I was drunk and I said to him, this was, gosh, I can't remember. Sam, you're a Snyderverse guy.
It was just before Batman versus Superman came out. So I don't know when that would be.
Yeah, 2015, 16 kind of time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I just went up to him and was like, oh, hey man, like, how's Batman versus Superman? Like a real bad opening gambit, honestly.
But he was, I can't talk about that. He was just so disinterested. He literally just turned away and just sort of faced the bar and drink in as, oh, okay, okay.
And then I kind of like, I'm not proud of this. So I was like, oh, I write for Empire. You know, just trying to get an opening.
And he was just kind of, oh, okay, cool. I was like, yeah, I write about the video games. And I'm not joking.
He swung around 90 degrees so fast and grabbed me by the shoulders. And he went, have you been playing Pillars of Eternity? And I'm like, I just go, well, yeah, I hadn't.
I hadn't played that game. But I've got him. He's looked at me deep in the eyes and those giant hands are clasped around me.
So I just lied and I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah, obviously.
And he's like, I'm just playing it in my trailer all the time right now. And he's like, I absolutely like, and he just starts like sounding off various like aspects of the game at me. And I'm just nodding like, oh yeah, absolutely.
That absolutely magnificent moment, the hang root there, just loved it, loved it. And we're talking for about 10, 15 minutes about this stuff. And we start getting into sort of like isometric RPGs, going back to the classics and then sort of moving to the more sort of modern RPG stuff.
And at this time, there's many levels of shame to this story, but at this time I just started working for Koch Media. And Koch Media has all these sort of various distributing deals across Europe. And I was privy to the, maybe I shouldn't mention a name, but I was privy to the release of an unannounced major RPG that was on the horizon.
And so, you know, I've got Henry, he's like enraptured by me at this point. So I say to Henry, I've got some good news for you. This new game in a very popular franchise we've just been talking about is going to get announced this year.
And it'll be out in October. And he just looked at me, just like overcome with excitement, clenches his fist and starts banging him on the table next to us and screams in the middle of this party, fucking yes. Everyone looks over.
And then his, and he's like, that's so exciting. And then his publicist ran over and said, come on, Henry, I think it's time we should leave. He just got dragged out of there.
And I was like, oh my God, like, I just made Henry Cavill just like have like this incredible, like over, like moment in the middle of this party. And then a friend from Empire came over and called me a star fucker and laughed. And, but, but, and this is, and I've told Sam this before, I credit myself as being the guy that broke the news that Henry Cavill was a big gaming nerd.
I feel like I set that trajectory from that moment because I then told the editor, one of the editors at Empire that Henry Cavill is a big Pillars of Eternity player. And they put that in the next issue as sort of like things we found interesting. Henry Cavill plays Pillars of Eternity.
That that became a thing. And then I think Obsidian saw it and then like started talking about it. And then it just sort of, you know, grew out from there.
So I'm just saying, I don't think if it wasn't for me, you know, you would never have been Geralt.
This is like my story about how I brought Twin Peaks back. And it's like not really accurate. It's not really accurate, but like-
I feel like that's more tangible.
I guess so, but then I interviewed Mark Frost and he had this quote about bringing the show back that traveled really far. Then someone asked NBC about it on stage about that quote. And then like, it was brought back about six months later.
It was formally like brought back. So that's my like, but I'm just saying it's as tenuous. You know what I mean?
With the kindling that created the fire that engulfed a generation.
Yeah, so, okay. That was a good story, Dave. Henry Cavill really needs like a pal who he can talk to about games.
I hope he's found one.
He should come on this podcast.
He really should, yeah. So you can make that happen, right, Matthew? You've got connections on that side.
I'll leave that to you.
I remember in your first podcast that I think Catherine had a Henry Cavill story and I thought there could be like a good trend where every one of your guests had to have a Henry Cavill story, you know?
It's a high bar, isn't it? But you know, it's something I'll consider for future episodes anyway. So Dave, I remember when you joined Imagine, you were staff writer, then everyone left and then you were suddenly running the magazine by yourself.
What was that whole sort of period like?
Terrible.
It was a pretty weird situation. It was kind of like a mass exodus around that time. So yeah, I was just like a staff writer and it's like, oh, okay, can you just like, here's a flat plan.
Can you, you know, put some content in it, you know? So it was pretty, pretty terrifying. It was just me.
And I think at that time, Josh West was the other staff writer. I think I was senior staff writer by the time that I was, or maybe they gave me the senior title, because they were like, well, that'll placate him if he's the editor of the magazine.
Yeah, enjoy this extra grant. You're now running the magazine.
Yeah, I went from 13 grand to 13.2 grand. And it was such a sweet victory for me. So yeah, no, it was pretty, it was pretty, it was pretty panicky, you know, just trying to figure all this stuff out.
But, you know, I kind of been doing it at that point, I think for about six to eight months, maybe. And like, I kind of got a gist of, you know, what GameCM was and sort of kind of tapped into its voice. So I would say that there was probably a rough few issues there.
But, you know, I kind of steadied the ship. And then I think you joined, Sam, you were the next editor, were you not?
Yeah, that's right. I think, so I was on Play magazine for about six months, a job I did not enjoy very much because PlayStation in like the late part of the PS3 generation was not the one, dog. And so I vaguely remember like there was some kind of war room-ish situation where we had to come up with games TM ideas.
And I was brought into that and you were there sort of like hurriedly writing them down. And I thought this poor dude is just sort of like drowning by himself making this magazine.
I think I was just drawing pictures in my notebook, something like that.
So yeah, I just, I got moved across and then we worked together for about 10 months. But I will say it was a very, very fun partnership that we had. What was it, what did you find working with me like on Games TM?
It was pretty tough. I mean, you demanded I was in at 7 a.m. every morning.
You kept putting cigarettes out on my desk. I had all these burn marks. Every, no, no, work with you is great.
It was, you know, you're a good collaborator, I would say. And I think we kind of have very similar gaming interests apart from Final Fantasy. And so we sort of gravitated towards the type of things that we wanted to talk about, be it silly superhero games or, you know, Zelda and, you know, whatever else it was.
And I think we focus less on sort of the experimental sort of side of the industry, which Games TM occasionally was sort of known for sort of promoting more highly and sort of went a little bit more mainstream with it, I would say. But I think that was to its benefit. I think we found a good sort of, we tapped into a unique tone of voice whilst covering some of the bigger games and anticipated titles that were coming down, right?
Yeah, I think so. I think like, I mean, it was 2013, so it was the new console launch year. So that drove the conversation to some degree.
There was a bit of an edict from above of like, can you get these black boxes onto the cover like eight times a week kind of situation. And so that was hard, but ultimately it was the right call because it did mean the mag sold fairly well that year. But yeah, I think that's probably true.
I think that's probably my mainstream taste at work. We didn't then do anything as bold as the Ouya cover on KSTM.
Ashley Day's legacy.
He'll love you credit in that video for this podcast. He loved the Ouya.
Won't stop going on about it. He made me do all the interviews and then he wrote the article and took all the credit. So I'm just putting it out there fresh.
Just slamming in publicly.
Oh, I think credit. I mean, that's age like fine milk really.
I know, that's why none of us care about it. But no, that was funny that period of the consoles because I think that was in that transition phase from when I was doing the, when I was editing and then before you joined, because I remember I had to do a bunch of those silly PS4 and Xbox One renders. So I can't even remember who we got to design those.
But I do remember, you know, we used to have a section at the front, which was we covered a lot of sort of the Japanese industry and what was going on, you know, on that side of things. And I had someone high up, I would say, and made me the day before deadline, take out eight pages on this particular thing that was happening in Japan at the time and replace it with respective bullshit on what the PS4 and Xbox One could be. So that was really fun.
But you know, that's magazines for you. A lot of it was very intense.
That was magazines at that company, I would say. Future was never like that, so yeah.
Well, yeah, fortunate for you guys, yeah.
The funniest bit though was when it was like, the PS4, what we know, it hasn't been announced yet. It's basically a picture of Homer Simpson's car on the front of a magazine. And you're like, this is tough.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think I did this cover, but there was the Nintendoat cover and it was like the downfall of Nintendo. They'll never come back.
And it was, you know, you'd have about four or five, you know, let's say reputable industry analysts who you'd call up each time and say, yeah, could you just say something horrible about Nintendo that we can quote, you know, about why they're gonna fail? And then, you know, you just plaster that in a magazine. So yeah, lots of occurrences like that.
Yeah, should we own up to the worst error that ever happened when I was editing the mag and you were working on it, Dave? Like, are you prepared to own up to that one? I can talk about that.
I know exactly what you're talking about. So we were looking for a new columnist. Is this the columnist story, right?
Yeah, it is.
Oh my goodness. I apologize again to Dan.
It is really embarrassing.
So, it's so bad. We were on the hunt for a new columnist because we've been using the same people for quite a while and we didn't have anyone who was sort of embedded in the more sort of modern development landscape. So I'd recently been interviewing the Chinese room, I think around the time of Amnesia that they worked on.
And I asked Dan Pinchbeck whether he'd be interested and after about a month of emailing, he came on board. And the first column hero, and a very talented game designer and writer, he could be a games journalist full-time if you wanted to be any journalist full-time. But anyway, I mistakenly credited the column to Dan Pinchbeck.
You've actually misremembered that, Dave. Have I? Yeah, we did a feature on the Chinese Room and throughout that feature, you referred to him as Dan Pinchbeck instead of Pinchbeck and then we approached him about the column afterwards, which was even more awkward and strange.
Yeah, yeah.
But I just wanted to mention that because in case people listen to this podcast and think, he sounds competent and they knew what he was doing on print media in the 2010s, the answer is I didn't really.
That's not the worst thing in the world.
I mean, Dan wasn't happy.
Oh, right.
Oh no, he was pretty, I think he was pretty chill about it.
He wasn't happy but he saw the funny side of it, you know.
Yeah, Pinchbeck instead of Pinchbeck, I really should have said that.
I was expecting something truly horrendous, like you were gonna credit it to a completely different person or edit it in some way that upset him, but I'd be fine with that.
A faux pas.
A minor faux pas.
One that haunts me to this day. It does lead to. So I left Imagine in late 2013 to go work on PC Game.
What happened to you after that, Dave? Because I became mega defensive about PC Gamer maybe going wrong under my watch and was quite cold towards you for the year following that, because I'm a dickhead basically. But what happened to you when I left?
Became very emotionally detached from reality. It was a sad time when you left the office. It was a really chaotic time for Games TM during that period.
We sort of cycled through various different editors over quite a long period of time. So again, I was the de facto editor for an extended period. I think I was deputy editor of Games TM at that.
But I was just features editor. It's hard to remember. I was just features editor, yeah.
The industry was sort of going, there was just lots of trends happening. And being in print and trying to latch onto a trend is just a false errand. Like you just can't, it's already passed by the time your issue's out.
And so, what would happen was DayZ was particularly popular for a while. And from up above, someone would come in and say, I've been hearing about this DayZ thing. Can we get this on the cover of the magazine?
I'm like, well, sure. And you know, spoke to Dean Hall and we did a cover, but by the time the issue came out, no one cared. You know, I hear this, Minecraft is a thing all the kids are playing.
Maybe we should put that on the cover. I'm like, okay, so we do like a Minecraft cover, but Minecraft's been out, you know, probably years at that point. And so a lot of the stuff, because there was no real, I think, authority, as it were, on the mag, and it was sort of me, I had to sort of act out the sort of, the whims of the higher ups.
And yeah, it made for a particularly turbulent time, I would say. But I still think we put out good magazines during that period and certainly, you know, great features. I really liked focusing on more quirky side of things, you know, doing features on like, what happened to the, is it ARPGs, what's the real life role playing things like the Halo one with the honey?
I Love Bees.
I Love Bees, yeah. That one. I love that stuff.
So we do like commissioned a feature on that. I had someone come up to me to talk about, they wanted to do a feature on, this was a retro feature on this, what was it? It was like a boarding school for girls who had created this game in the 80s.
I can't remember the details of it, but it was like this really fascinating sort of untold story and so commissioning stuff like that, that was just a little bit off from center and sort of dug into stuff that isn't normally spoken about.
I remember that boarding school feature. That was really good. I think it happened when I was there still.
Because it was like quite a lot of research when it was that one, but it was like, yeah. Was it like a basically like a bunch of young women like were taught to make games or learned to make games within that environment? Just yeah, really interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, it was a good time. And also I had this real thing where I wanted to get various creators together and interview each other. And it never panned out, but I did one with Peter Molyneux and Ian Livingston, who are friends and just got just sat in a room with them for two and a half hours and just listened to them.
Like they had like some, you know, some bullet points sort of topics to cover, but just hearing those sort of two friends just sort of discuss the industry. And that was really fun. I want to keep doing more of that.
And I remember just like I had various things going through publishers and PRs where like, I think I had Jake Solomon and Randy Pitchford who we were just trying to figure out a location and it all fell through and I had a few of those all lined up and then it kind of never happened and I got moved on to a different magazine. So it was never to be. But I was just I was just interested in doing something just outside of the typical sort of feature feature list feature format that was kind of established on Games TM prior to that.
Yeah, you were like the I think you were about five years too late basically for the type of features ed role you were sort of like really good at. Like it's it's you know, that sort of classic print features editor role I think is is kind of the best job you can get in games media personally, you have to prove pages or worry about the actual mag side of things or maybe you do prove your own pages. But you're not like looking at the whole mag and you get to like focus on that idea side of things.
Yeah, you're you're really good at it. So we can see why that was appealing. So you left games media to work in PR.
What motivated that for you? Were you just like the opportunities were just sort of like a bit thin on the ground or would we do we just like I need to go where the money is because I have a family. What kind of like led to that for you?
The Pinchback fiasco just really like, you know, they cast me out the industry for it. So I had to.
Yeah, the walking sim fans really had pitchforks for Dave, if I recall.
No, I use money, cold hard cash. That was that was a big motivator. But honestly, that that was kind of the thing that drew me out.
Like, you know, it's no secret that especially Imagine wasn't exactly great in terms of pay. And, you know, there was more to be more money to be earned in PR. And it's a shame.
And, you know, you could feel the walls closing in at Imagine. And I've been moved to X1 at that point, and I was enjoying that magazine. It was obviously more more of a mainstream publication.
You know, it was it was that, you know, top 10 lists. And, you know, here's a guy to Arkham Knight and, you know, sticking every single recognizable IP on the cover all the time, you know. And that was fine.
And, you know, there was still a lot of gratification in what we produced during that period. But, you know, sales were dwindling. You could the desks were getting closer and closer together.
There were fewer like when someone left the company, they weren't getting replaced. So it was getting harder and harder to make magazines and this PR opportunity came up at Quotch Media. And I went into the Head of Publishing's office and explained the opportunity to be presented to me and he was very frank and he said, look, we're going to close your magazine down in the next, you know, 12 months, please don't tell anyone, but we're going to close your magazine down in the next 12 months.
And yeah, like you'll still have a job here, you know, but you could be, you could be on another video game magazine or you could be on like how to, you know, knitting for beginners, like you know, but we'll find a place for you. So he said, if I was you, I'd take the job. And so that was, I think, a bit of a good advice.
Yeah, good advice. It was, it was. And I appreciate the honesty.
And so, you know, I took the opportunity. And yeah, like, you know, I, I enjoy this side of the business. I enjoy working on games.
I enjoy that insight into development. And that's something that I've really sort of attached myself to as, as I moved into PR is like being able to work with the studios themselves and having like build up a relationship with them, understanding what the game they're making is and like, you know, what they're passionate about, about their game and, you know, trying to sort of shape, you know, the PR or the marketing, you know, around sort of that and not just, you know, your usual sort of press releases or whatever, like just this following the same A to Z roadmap of a lot of marketing, just, just really embed myself with those different teams and, and sort of convey what they love about what they're doing to other people.
Sure. Yeah, that makes sense. Do you want to talk about Nightingale then and that side of things for you, what you're working on these days?
Yeah, like Nightingale, I've been, I mean, I, I've been in a bunch of different PR jobs. So I was at Improbable for quite a period and whilst at Improbable, they created a internal studio called Improbable Canada, which was fronted by Aaron Flynn, who was general manager of Bioware. You know, he's been working there since, well, a long, long time.
I'm trying to think of the first game that he was on. But you know, Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, you know, he's, he's had a, you know, a huge impact over some of the, you know, the classics of the RPG genre. And so they brought him on and he, and he created a team out in Edmonton to develop what was originally going to be a sort of MMO that was going to utilize Improbable's sort of, you know, cloud technology to, you know, create, you know, huge worlds of sort of, you know, unparalleled scale, but over time without going into the details, the finer details of it, they split off and the game sort of got reshaped as a, as a survival crafting experience and, but it still has that sort of richness of lore and, and story that, that, you know, Aran, you know, history sort of has leaned into, you know, creating these really immersive worlds that sort of have, have a bunch of character and, and I don't know, just like this, this, this sort of tangibility to them, but, but Nightingale has been a lot of fun.
We announced it a couple of years back and so we've been doing a lot of play testing with the community and sort of appearing at various different events and we seem to have resonated quite, quite a bit with, with gamers and I think the survival crafting genre is one where the people who love those types of games are sort of, you know, hungry for more constantly, you know. So we're going to be out in February next year, February 22nd. So looking forward to people finally be able to jump in.
Cool. Sounds good. And I'm sure you'll ask Aaron to come on our podcast.
We're going to do a Dragon Age pod next year, Dave. So you know what?
He'd absolutely be up for that. Yeah, for sure. And I'll sit behind him breathing heavily just to make sure he doesn't say, as PRs do, just sit in the room and just give them a look when they're going off of peace.
Yeah, don't slug anyone off. Don't slug anyone off. So Dave kind of brought you on this episode because you are a big superhero guy, as established earlier discussion of a chapter about Ant-Man in a book that Matthew hasn't read.
So why are you a big superhero guy? Is the genre treating you well these days?
That's a loady question. I'm loving Loki. Has anyone been watching Loki season two?
Oh my gosh.
Not season two.
MCU is back, baby. Come on, let's go.
It's really good.
The last episode, it was the most excited I've been with a cliffhanger since that WandaVision Quicksilver reveal. Anyway, I digress.
I don't know, superhero stuff, I've always read a few comics as a kid, but I wouldn't say that unlike yourself, Sam, I wasn't really a comic books kid and probably because I grew up in a tiny little town where you actually couldn't buy comic books. So that probably impacted that somewhat. So it all came through the movies and video games.
And so I loved the X-Men films, Spider-Man films. I just basically watched anything superhero related and then the MCU started and I kind of go into that. And I think it's kind of aged like milk now, but I kind of had an online brand for a while was like the MCU Ranker, which I regret massively.
I've kind of tried to distance myself from that. I need a new ranking topic to go for.
Are you sure it's a Ranker they were calling you, Dave and not something else?
I did mention that we were talking to you on the podcast to some of my work colleagues and one of them said, Oh yeah, he used to rank MCU films.
I can't believe I defined myself online by such a, you know, pissy little, like, just trend. It's terrible. But anyway, yeah, I just need to-
When did you stop ranking?
I mean, I never stop ranking. It's all in my head, you know. You can't stop once you start.
It's just in you. You know, it's part of you at that point. But no, I-
You still rank, don't you, Dave?
I think I do still do it occasionally, yeah. I am my own worst enemy. But you know, I try to throw in a few others.
I need to just do like a full 180, just go in the opposite direction, start like ranking, you know, Claire Denis films or something, you know.
It's a really cool channel. Yeah. You are like a big movie fan.
That's the thing. You're like, oh, have you seen this thing? It's on movie or whatever.
And I'm like, no, I haven't.
Well, Sam, you and I just went to London Film Festival together and had a wonderful time watching Maestro and Priscilla. So, you know, I'm a man of all tastes. But, you know, I honestly, I mean, you know, maybe it's was Alan Moore used to say, you know, like superhero films just make every adult a child.
But, you know, there is a comfort in the genre. It's easy pleasures. And, you know, I think when it's done right, it can do more than that, you know.
I think, you know, stuff like One Division, Black Panther, you know, have more layers to them and have a sophistication to them and their execution that I think, you know, elevate the genre. But sometimes it's just cool to watch people, you know, just punch each other, you know, punch a big purple dude with rocks on his hands, you know. I'm not above that.
So, yeah, I've just been all in on it since probably around the first Avengers movie. I just unfortunately built a reputation around, like, superhero films that continues to haunt me to this day.
Has Sam shared The Back Page MCU rankings with you?
I listen to it.
I'm a big fan of The Pod. I mean, come on, guys. I listen to all.
I'm a, was it, a Patreon subscriber, you know. I get all the XXLs.
And I appreciate it. I know that we upset a lot of the Discord with our Eternals take.
Now, I love Eternals too. I'm a big Eternals guy. I actually think that's one of the better films since Endgame.
Yeah, Three Giant Men like Eternals. That's good.
Chloe Zhao got the, unnecessarily got the stick for that because of, you know, she just come off an Oscar winning film. And I think it was unfair. I think that is a good film with a lot of artistic merit to it.
Yeah, no one's going to fuck with Three Giant Men with that opinion.
I should point out that Dave is giant because he's very tall. He's not like, you know, wide like me.
No, you don't need to describe. It's fine. My physicality doesn't need to be discussed.
That's true. You are just appearing in audio.
I'm large in terms of volume.
Yeah, matter. Yeah, so I just speak of Eternals. Actually, I was doing like a clean out of my flat the other day and I found her in the cupboard.
I found like the the present from my brother that shows the most contempt for me, which is like the smallest Lego Marvel's Eternals set that they did. And it has like Icarus in it, Richard Madden's character. And sprites that little like character.
And it's like completely sealed, never opened, like genuinely one of the worst gifts I've ever received. Just amazing stuff, really.
I texted you from Disneyland with the discounted Eternals merch that they had in every shop because they could just not shift it. And it was all there, about 10% of the price that it should have been. And I was like, Sam, do you want me to just bring all this back for you?
Because I know you're such a fan.
Yeah, speaking of that, it's very, very easy to get discounts. Marvel Legends, Kang the Conqueror figures at the moment. I'll leave you to figure out why that is.
No comment. So what's the relationship with superhero games, Dave? Was Spider-Man 2, the original Spider-Man 2 on PS2, a key text for you?
Well, I actually had it on the GameCube.
Right, right.
But yeah, it absolutely was. I mean, that's the pinnacle of licensed games, right? It's certainly movie licensed games, I would say.
I think it's been discussed ad nauseam by various other people, but the swinging around in open world New York was just mind blowing to me at that point. And then having the sort of authenticity of the various actors from the movie, like Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst doing the voices as well. And just replicating a lot of the cinematic moments from the movie, it was phenomenal.
I absolutely loved that game and I think that its shadow has loomed large over other superhero games since. And it's only really since Insomniac's Spider-Man back in 2018 that anyone has really sort of lived up to the reputation of that Spider-Man game.
Yeah, I think that's true. So that was the next thing I was going to ask really. But I think that the PS4 Spider-Man game in 2018 was like this thing that everyone was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
Basically, it's like we for years there were like lots of Super Spider-Man games that did not reach the full potential of that character. But it felt like an open goal to make make one that was really high quality and basically like, you know, the modern version of Spider-Man 2, the game that you remember, but without all of the rough edges sanded off. Is that kind of what Spider-Man represents in the course of superior games, Dave?
Just something that everyone wanted and it was just realized in that moment.
Yeah, I don't think there's a better superhero that translates to video games, right? Like his sort of suite of powers, the world with the inhabits, his sort of roster of characters, you know, it completely delivers on the sort of fantasy fulfillment of being a superhero, you know, in video games. Even Batman, I don't think as much as I love the Arkham games, I don't think it can be as good as what a great Spider-Man game can be.
Oh, I hard disagree on that. What do you think of that, Matthew? Like in terms of, I guess, what PS4 Spider-Man represented, but also, I guess, like, you know, Spider-Man's potential in the video game space versus other superhero's?
I mean, I see where Dave's coming from in terms of like, maybe like the scale of the fantasy and what you can do, you know, particularly like modern hardware, like having that whole city, you know, Spider-Man can do kind of very kind of close up stuff, you know, the kind of more nuanced combat and stealth, but then you can zoom right out and have the incredible freedom of that city and it is super iconic. But I'd say like Batman is as iconic in terms of the ingredients it has to play with. Is it more limited?
It's a really tricky one. I still think the best Batman game is better than the best Spider-Man game. Yeah, I think so too.
But is there potential for more than that?
I think there is. I agree. I think the best of the Arkham games is still better than, you know, the Spider-Man games that we've had so far, but I do think there's a better Spider-Man game to be made.
Interesting. I think it's partly because that, you know, the Rocksteady take on Batman punched so far above the weight, its own weight, in terms of like where we thought that game was going to land when it was announced, Arkham Asylum versus where it ended up, and the way they built on it was kind of extraordinary. In some ways, I think they were overachievers, Rocksteady, and so that sets such a high bar for Batman.
I think as well, like, the one thing that Spider-Man is limited by is the fact that he's grounded in a version of the real world, right, in New York City, whereas Rocksteady had the good fortune of Arkham and, sorry, Gotham being completely fictional, so they were able to have sort of a bit of creative license with that world and be able to sort of structure it how they wanted it to be, to sort of, you know, to their aesthetic and their vision of what a Batman game should be. So I think that's the biggest advantage of the Batman games.
Yeah, I think that is true, actually. I think he also has a slightly better Rose Gallery as well. I think people would probably agree that Batman's got the ultimate.
You really? You're a big shocker guy?
Oh, you big mad hatter guy? Like, we could do this all day, pal.
Well, I like Spider-Man.
I love Professor Pig said no one ever.
Professor Pig's a fucking great villain. If you ever read Grant Morrison's Batman, you're a fucking Philistine. That's your problem, mate.
But I think that Spider-Man's villains are kind of knowingly goofy, right? Not all of them. Some of them are quite serious.
But they are meant to be about as colourful and sort of ridiculous as he is, really.
Totally. It's just a much more colourful and sort of, dare I say it, family-friendly pitch, you know?
Spider-Man has great potential for range in that it can be very bright and sunny. Maybe they do in the comics, but I can't really see a Spider-Man that pushes as dark as Batman can go. But it does have that range.
Batman, for all its brilliance in those games, it's always a man stomping around a very dark city at night. I think one of the treats of Spider-Man, the new ones anyway, is just being able to drink it all in and the joy of a bright sunny day, and the city lit up at night. Just visually, Spider-Man has a wider palette, which is quite exciting.
Yeah, I think that is fair. It's also just that it is a different fantasy it's selling to, right? The comic books are a side of this, but also for people who grew up watching the Raimi films, it feels like when there's a sunset and you see it bouncing off the windows in Spider-Man or Spider-Man 2, they are selling you basically what the shots of Spider-Man in those Raimi films look like.
They bottle that up and put it in a game and sold it to you. It's quite the thing and it is different to anything that Batman offers.
Spider-Man is just a really good hang. It can be much lighter on its feet and just celebratory and it can have just an outright happy ending and that's fine. Where in Batman, I think there's always that kind of, no matter how well the day goes, he's going to go back to his house and be a bit sad about his parents.
I don't think enough credit goes to Raimi for really establishing the tone and the visual language of Spider-Man because even the Andrew Garfield films, they're just muddy and I don't think there's anything that stands out visually from those movies and I think even the Tom Holland lot do trade a little bit on the Sam Raimi foundations, albeit they kind of, okay, we're going to go to Europe or we're going to go into the suburbs a bit and not focus so much on the city. But I think that has defined what Spider-Man should be to more than one generation, whereas Batman, Burton had such a peculiar and unique aesthetic to his world and then it's been redefined several times since that there isn't one way to do a Batman, whereas I think there probably is a one way, at least at the moment, for a Spider-Man to look, you know, I mean, obviously, I think the counter-argument there is probably Spider-Verse, which obviously is just visually overwhelming and just like this incredibly colourful pop-art like experience. But in terms of live action, at least, I think Raimi has, you know, set a very specific design for what Spider-Man should be and the video games are lifted directly from that.
Yeah. So Dave, why do you think that the Insomniac Spider-Man game didn't get questions around authenticity or being off-brand like the Avengers game did? The MCU has created some headaches for making Marvel games a little bit, I think.
What's their secret? Yeah.
Again, I think it's because there's been various iterations of Spider-Man over the years, you know, cartoons, different actors playing the movies, so that there's not one face that defines Spider-Man to people, whereas the Avengers game came so close to the height of the MCU, and those actors defined those characters. The only exception would be the Hulk, but in terms of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, those are very much the two Chris's and Robert Downey Jr. They are those characters, and that's why I think they would struggle, whatever multiverse shenanigans they get up to in the MCU, that they could recast those actors. I think that would be a very difficult job for them to pull off.
So that game didn't have, I guess, the luxury. And I think the Guardians of the Galaxy game had the same issue, although I think it was more successful in its different interpretation, is that those characters are just so associated with those actors that you just feel like a sort of bargain basement ripoff when you just try to do their thing but with a different face on it.
Yeah, I sort of get that. I think the Guardians game did get a bit closer, but I think the take on the characters is probably fair, much as I did like the Peter Quill in that who was like, bro, Rocket Raccoon. That was kind of like his whole vibe.
Okay, let's take a break then. We'll come back and talk about Spider-Man 2 specifically.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, we've been playing Spider-Man 2, much as the world has. I intended this to be an episode where we can talk about spoilers, because I would have finished it, however, I failed to do that.
At the same time, though, I think that people will probably appreciate the idea that this is like an episode that will touch on major moments, but not really ruin them. We're gonna avoid ruining the big stuff, I would say, but we might allude to some key events without giving the game away. So, threading the line, really, expecting that some people listening have played it, but some people might be saving it for Christmas, et cetera.
So, Spider-Man 2, then. The story of this game, it's basically Kraven the Hunter comes to New York City looking for prey, and that includes Spider-Man and his villains. At the same time, Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn, who has been in Europe, quote unquote, but actually suffering from a serious illness, has reappeared on the scene, too.
And there is a big breakout from the raft at the start of this game. Well, I think it's a boat that's on the way to the raft, actually, with a bunch of Spider-Man villains in it. The raft is a super-powered prison.
There's a great arc of New Avengers, actually, where it's the very first arc of New Avengers, 2004, Brian Michael Bendis and David Finch, where the raft is, basically, there's a big explosion and all the villains escape and the Avengers have to stop them. That book is fucking rad. Went down a bit of a tangent there, but a little recommendation for listeners.
I have a problem with the concept of the raft as the most dangerous criminals known to man are stored in this prison, which is like maybe a hundred meters swim from the banks. I don't feel like that is an optimal place for it. Surely you'd put it out at sea, wouldn't you?
It's a good point. I did also think, why did they let Kurt Connors live in Manhattan still? Wouldn't you be like, look, I need you to move to Milwaukee or something.
It's also such an ugly building. The idea that you could convince the people of New York that every time you look out of your window, you're gonna see the scariest prison ever. I just don't see people going for it.
It's just a lot on the horizon.
I said this in Twitter, but I don't wanna criticize anyone for doing their job wrong. But if I was running a supervillain prison, I'd probably take their supervillain costume, which has a lethal poison inside it and an extensive armor off them as I incarcerate them. It seems like a faux pas to me.
Yeah, so you have basically the breakout of this ship that's sent by its way to the raft. And so the scorpion escapes and so too does Mr. Negative, Martin Li, the two Spider-Men, Peter Parker and Miles Morales basically trying to get the villains back. And obviously Miles Morales has a, basically like a personal stake in this because Mr. Negative is responsible for the death of his father in the previous game.
So quite a lot going on narratively, kind of like has a lot of momentum from the off. The very start of the game, I suppose we can spoil this because this is like literally the start and lots of people have played this at this point. It's the first thing you do.
Pretty amazing set piece with Sandman in Manhattan, really sets their expectations high for big scripted set pieces in this game. That's pretty cool. So I guess like to start with like the top line thoughts, Matthew, how do you feel about this game?
I really liked it. I had a great time with it. I think it's the best of the Spider-Man games they've made.
Just felt like a really confident step up. And actually that thing about the opening with Sandman, like it actually reminded me a bit of like, the kind of big set piece they used to open God of War with. And the whole thing, if I was going to equate it to anything, kind of reminded me of like the step up from like God of War 1 to God of War 2, where you just take everything that you did so well in the first, that everyone like really gelled with and really loved.
And you know, you polish it up and the extra things you add, don't diminish it in any way. You tighten a few things. It's, you know, we can go into this in more detail later, but I think it's as open world checklist games go, it's really, really well judged in terms of like the amount of content and how that content is woven into the story.
Yeah, I just, you know, it is a repeat of the formula of Spider-Man 1, but without the few sticking points I had with that game. So, you know, big sort of mission accomplished for me.
Okay, yes, I think that's probably like the emerging consensus around the game is that it's a step up in a bunch of ways. And I think that's completely a fair observation. Dave, how about you?
You've just finished it, right? You've 100%ed it, is that right?
100%ed it, yeah, yeah. I loved it, loved it. Start to finish.
I told you earlier, it's like a 10 out of 10 for me. I know that's pretty bold, but honestly, there are very few faults that I could see. I say it starts big and it doesn't let up.
And it has time both in terms of within its main story and within some of the side missions to sort of slow down and have these sort of very poignant character moments as well. But I was honestly just impressed. I just, I love the world.
I love swinging around. You have the way that it sort of doesn't diminish your sort of that power curve that you learn in the first game and in Miles Morales and just expands on it. It gives you more tools to explore the city with, it gives you more variety in the combat with various different upgrades you have.
The, I think as well, it's sort of upgraded from the relative, I'd say sort of B and C tier villains that sort of pervaded through the first game and certainly Miles Morales and sort of really brought in the well-known Rogues Gallery into this one. I just thought it was fantastic. And I enjoyed it pretty much every moment of it.
Yeah, I think it's really strong sequel. It's sort of like there's a big step up in sort of presentation of story. There's a lot more going on in terms of story that's woven into the main missions as well, partly assisted by the fact that they're doing these scripted events that might remind you of like Naughty Dog games and how uncharted set pieces work like stuff kind of that's kind of on rails.
But I think it's a good transition because I think a criticism you can level at the original game is that a lot of the missions end up feeling quite anonymous. I imagine that people remember the big encounters of bosses in that first game, but not the individual missions here. It feels like the characters aren't necessarily like the big star of a set piece.
It's a set piece itself. And that's, I think, a bit of a transition point. And as someone who enjoys the big Polish blockbuster experience, I really like that.
I think it has a couple of drawbacks that come with that. We'll get into that. But I do agree that there is a unique challenge with making a third Spider-Man game since 2018 in basically not just repeating the same thing.
I think because you have to set Spider-Man game in New York, you have to have that certain set of traversal powers and they already nailed that the first time around. It does become a tricky equation of what can you add to that formula without really taking away from it. And I appreciate, there's not every decision they've made here totally lands for me, but most of them do.
I think that's a testament to the fact they have thought long and hard about this and it's anything but a cache in it really is like proper, sort of like they thought hard about how to layer things on top of that combat without losing what they already had. So yeah, really strong. And if you like Spider-Man as well, it's got a really fucking great story.
That's the thing, you just, you can't argue with the script writing, the characterization, and the way that the cut scenes are rendered, just it's a terrifically presented if you're a big Spider-Man head, essentially, spidey head. So yeah, yeah, I'm fond of it as well. So I was curious, Matthew, what you made of the way they've avoided the pitfalls of like repeating themselves and how they've kept the formula fresh in this one.
Which of the kind of like major changes work for you?
I think I really like the new movement options. So they've added these web wings that let you speed through the city. I think they understand that you've, you know, the chances are you've done this city at least one time before, and you can take it at incredible speed.
Now, I think they're less precious about, you know, spending time in that city. It becomes more of a backdrop for these sort of spectacular set piece missions, which feel like they're a bit more localized. Like you go to specific locations and loads of mad shit kicks off rather than, you know, there's a couple of chases through the city itself, but I think they understand that like, that the wow factor of being in that city is maybe slightly diminished.
So they don't dwell on it as much. The web wings, you know, you can still swing and everything, but if you're gliding with web wings, you can go into these wind tunnels, which kind of fire you through it really quickly. And I just liked how fast it got me to all the new stuff.
And I think that thing you said about the jump in storytelling techniques and the way they weave like interactive cut scenes into the missions, you know, scenes where you're switching, you know, switching characters and different, you know, you sort of see it from different perspectives is really interesting. And you know, the other jump is this slightly kind of intangible improvement in writing and character arcs and the fact that it spends like a long time kind of bedding in the characters and their relationships so that when stuff does kick off, it becomes a bit more meaningful. Like it's, I was actually quite surprised by how late they hold back like just the arrival of like the symbiote suit, which is like one of the big new kind of mechanics in this is that you have this new move set, you know, it probably arrives about halfway through the game, which is quite late to hold it off.
But by then you kind of know what everyone's deal is. And you know, you've got this narrative element which hinges on people's emotional turmoil. So you have to establish those stakes for it to kind of make any sense.
And I just think there's a lot of really sort of smart decisions in that. So it's not necessarily like a back of the box feature. You can kind of tick and go, it's this.
It's just a sort of a general increase in sophistication.
Yeah, I think that's probably fair. So Dave, what do you think about how they've kept the formula fresh in this game, the new additions to the mechanics in the game?
Yeah, I agree with what Matthew was saying. There definitely is sort of a less of an interest clearly on New York. You know, New York is a character and it's much more about building around those set pieces and building those character moments.
I think as well what does help is Miles Morales. I don't think Miles Morales gets enough credit for being a great Christmas game. Like the way that it transforms that world with lighting, with snow, the weather effects, and just in general sort of the story around that time of year, it kind of makes it feel self-contained.
And you know, even though that game is much bigger than I think a lot of people anticipated prior to it coming out, it does feel like a side story because of the fact that it's sort of set up as like a Christmas tale. So this being sort of like a full blooded sequel that sort of takes the visual language of the first one and then sort of expands it. You've got, you know, those new areas outside of the main New York Island.
I don't know what it's called. What is it? Brooklyn and Queens and all that.
Yeah, so, you know, again, it sort of takes it outside of sort of Spider-Man's exterior life and takes it more into Peter Parker's interior life as it goes out and Miles Morales's as it goes out into those areas of the map. So I think that, yeah, that they've looked at it like in terms of sort of avoiding, as you're saying, that sort of staleness that could have occurred. They have, you know, focused more on who the characters are and what worked about the original.
I just sort of, you know, amped it up significantly.
Yeah, so it's interesting because they have dual protagonists in this game, as you mentioned there. So you have Miles Morales who lives in Harlem. That's his, essentially his part of the city.
And then, yeah, Queens is Peter's, so a little bit more suburban. You get a little bit of that suburban New York flavor you didn't really get in the original game. So that's one way in which they've changed the map a little bit.
And yeah, I also like the idea of the dual protagonist does give the, just allow the story to switch perspectives, which is good. I would say it primarily feels like Peter's story, but there are definitely moments where it does feel like my whole story at the same time.
I think that.
And they're both really nicely.
So I was just gonna say, I think that sort of switches a bit. I don't know how far you got, Matthew, if you, did you finish it, Matthew? I think that kind of changes about halfway through.
I think it definitely leans more into miles in the second half of the game. At least that's what I felt. I don't know if you agree with that, Matthew.
Yeah, it's tricky because there's definitely like, the symbiote story is more Peter Parker's story, but Miles is a big bit of it. I think they do a good job of keeping them both in play. I think they, like the reintroduction of like Mr. Negative and this idea that there's like beef and trauma between Miles and him kind of gives him a, you know, a sort of his own sort of antagonist to focus.
Like it's quite clever how they both have quite clear arcs going through it. And, you know, one of the things I was gonna shout out actually is this is clearly a project which has been planned from the very start, like the way that it builds on what happens in Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales. It doesn't, you know, it feels like they've got a very clear idea of what they're doing in terms of acts.
So the fact that he can bring back in Mr. Negative and what he sort of represents in the stories is really neat. Yeah, like they both, I feel like by the end, it's hard to say without spoiling it, like they've kind of, Miles Morales has his due, I think.
Yeah, it's interesting as well, because I think that it allows them to have slightly different power sets. So you sort of get the feeling of like a superhero team game in this, except they've split it between two characters. And I think that comes from a few things.
So obviously they've expanded the skill set of the characters. So Miles has these sort of like energy-based powers. I could basically be like Palpatine lightning shit in this, which is quite wild, but pretty cool.
Obviously the symbiote powers, once you get them, that expands Peter's repertoire too. So he has a lot going on. And then obviously with the gliding powers too, they're just, those combined with the gadgets means you have like a lot of versatility of what these different characters can do.
So I really love that as a premise to sort of like, create this quite, I guess, like wide canvas of cool superhero stuff you can do in this game, just with the character Spider-Man essentially. So that I really like.
Also, I think it allows them to begin to tap into this sense of like, you're in this city full of heroes, admittedly they've only really got two, but one of the beautiful little touches, and I think they did this in Arkham Knight as well, is that if you're playing as one of them and you go to do one of the randomised crime events, sometimes you'll find the other one there already having a fight. And there's this sense of like, oh yeah, this is a city with two Spider-Men, of course you're going to run into the other one. When you fight alongside each other, you get dual takedowns.
You definitely fought alongside sidekicks in Arkham Knight, right?
Yeah, in the Nightwing and Robber.
And those moments were always really cool. And it does it without spoiling some of the side content. There's definitely another character who you can eventually start seeing around the city, which is cool.
You get the sense of like, oh, in another game's tie, if they keep building this out, that's their version of the MCU, is that they've introduced all these characters and gradually this city is going to become fuller and fuller with them, like bumping into them and seeing what they're up to. I really like that. I thought it sold the fantasy of that kind of connected universe.
That was like something the first one just doesn't have and can't really do. So that was cool.
I like that a lot too. And although I think you're overselling that, that side character who turns up, that people shouldn't get their hopes up of who that might be. It's not like Wolverine or anything.
Yeah, I just didn't know how spoilery it is.
It's not that big of a difference. One of the points that I think... I think one of the weaker things that the game does...
Actually, that's a weak thing. I would just say it's a disappointment for me. They established this version of Spider-Man existing in a world with all these other superheroes.
You've got the looming Avengers Tower that sort of pierces the map. You have the Wakanda Embassy.
And you have Daredevil's law offices, all those sort of landmarks, and Dr. Strange's gaffes there, too. But I thought after the first game that they would deliver on that promise a bit more, that there would be a little bit more interconnectivity with other characters. It doesn't mean they have to be like, oh, look, this is the mission where Wolverine turns up, and this is the mission where Iron Man turns up or whatever.
But it really just is window dressing. There's no actual substance to those references at all. And I found that quite disappointing in a way.
I know it's a Spider-Man story, but I don't think you should have those elements in the game if you're not going to pay them off to some respect.
I disagree with that. I mean, first of all, I like the Doctor Strange's gaffe. It's actually called the gaffe Sanctorum, Dave, just to make that very clear.
But they've actually suggested in an interview that there might be Daredevil stuff to come because there's some weird Easter egg when you go to their offices or something.
Yeah, the signs come down, which was in the first game. But the plaque is still there, but the actual Nelson and Murdock is not there anymore.
They've said as well, haven't they, that their Wolverine game is going to exist in this same world?
Yeah, they did, but then make more of a reference to it, though. I don't know, this is MCU brain rot taking me over.
But maybe they would just want to introduce him properly in his standalone game. It feels like the cadence is going to be Wolverine and then Spider-Man 3. They describe this game as...
Whatever you establish in Wolverine, you could then drag into this universe.
Yeah, for sure, because they talked about this game being their Civil War, which I think that's not exactly a one-to-one comparison having played at all, but I get it. But they've said that Game 3 will be their Infinity War, I guess. So, what that...
I mean, it's a smaller version of it, for sure, but I think the few bones they did throw people, they were enough for me as a casual Spider-Man liker.
Yeah, I hard disagree, Dave. I think the more you push into that stuff, the more you've got to earn it. And if you rush that stuff, it starts feeling like the MCU, where it's just cameo overload.
The idea of it just being beyond your reach, I think, is quite nice. And then they can choose to build on it if they want to.
I needed more. I needed more. There's a mission, I don't know if you want to spoil it or not, but there is a mission which does touch on another Marvel character.
And I think the payoff for that is pretty weak. You sent me a meme, Sam, and I knew you felt the same.
Yeah, actually, are we talking about the same thing here? I don't know, but I'm not sure.
You get a letter from someone. Are we talking portals?
Oh, yes, yes, of course, yeah. Getting a letter, yeah.
You could have done that in a better way, is all I'm saying. And again, I love the game, but I was like, that was not a satisfying sort of reveal to conclude that particular chapter.
Well, there's a lot they can do with it, that's the thing. Maybe we'll save this for a bit, a discussion a little bit later on, because there's more to get through first. So we've got Kraven the Hunter as the initial villain of the game.
Then when the symbiote comes into it, obviously there is a venom-based element to this as well. So what do you make of Kraven, Dave? I find Kraven quite an interesting villain.
I remember when I read Ultimate Spider-Man, the Bendis comic, the thing they did with him was basically make him a Steve Irwin-style reality TV star who then pumps himself up with drugs. He's considered a bit of an embarrassment by the other superheroes here. This guy's basically a terrorist, he's got a massive armed militia with him.
Interestingly, there are no cops in this game, there are no police at all, which is something that only really occurred to me when I got about halfway through it, but instead you basically have Kraven the Hunter's militia. And he's a nasty piece of work, he's established as maybe a bit darker than you would perhaps expect from a Spider-Man villain fairly early on in this game. What do you make of him, Dave?
I love the premise, I love the idea of this guy being like, okay, this is the hub of the weirdos and super freaks and I'm just going to go in and hunt them all down. I think that's just such a great concept for the second game and allows them to really pull in all those great villains in Spider-Man's gallery. Craven himself, I've never really understood his appeal too much.
I mean, I've got that movie coming out. It was meant to be this year, next year. Aaron Taylor Johnson.
I mean, who wants to see that? It's going to be so fucking bad.
By the Triple Frontier dude, right?
So that's a margin call director? Is that the same guy? Fucking hell.
That's like JC. Chandler. Chandler.
Yeah, that's the one. Yeah.
Chandler.
Yeah. So anyway, I'm sure that'll be as revered as his other works. But yeah, Craven's just been always been sort of like a silly, you know, throwaway villain to me.
I never really got his appeal, but I think they do well to not only ground his motivations, you know, pretty, pretty great, but also just to make him pretty, pretty fearsome and intimidating. As as a presence, you know, he's huge, his, his army are just everywhere. And I think it is sinister and he, you know, there's, there's, there's a danger to him.
And, you know, the fact that he's taking down all these villains, like, easily, I think sets the stakes pretty high for Spider-Man. So yeah, I really like this interpretation of him as a character that I gave no shits about prior to this game.
Yeah, I'm not that familiar with the character on paper, you know, maybe because I'd seen the trailer for the not very good looking film, I thought, I'm not really into this, you know, is this kind of like too, too many cooks. Sometimes, you know, I always think back to Spider-Man 3 and just, you can overdo it and you can step on the toes of other characters if you, if you try and do too much at once. But actually, his role as this sort of secondary antagonist and how he kind of drives bits of the plot, he's a really, he's a really good device.
I found him compelling enough. I quite like his sort of full bodied voice acting thing. And I think as the story goes on, they do give him like a little bit of inner life in terms of like what he's actually, you know, trying to do and what he actually wants from all this.
Yeah, I liked it, I too, I really liked was he in his little army, you know, he's got always different like foot soldier types who kind of mix up the combat. I felt like there was a bit more going on in terms of enemy variety in this one, which was good. But I really like he's got his robot birds and there's just a lot, the combat in this game is like a lot more, it feels a lot more aerial because of it.
Like you're always kind of pulling yourself up into the air and doing all this amazing stuff. It feels like you can spend like 30 seconds in the air without ever coming back down and like pulling people up and all these like weird sort of robot birds and he's got hunters who kind of climb up on things, kind of pulls you up there. So if only for his aerial troops, I appreciate him as like what he brings to what he brings to the game.
But yeah, he's good to like, he fits in with it and like how his sort of storyline where it goes, I thought was quite neat.
It's like they took the...
Robot dogs, I can live without personally, sorry. Yeah, robot dogs, I'm not like, they're a bit of an L from me personally.
Oh, I liked...
You're wrong, Sam.
I don't know, because you can chuck them at people when they're about to explode. That's quite fun.
That is good. I suppose I didn't pose like a massive threat either really, when they're on the ground. So they are kind of like projectiles in plain sight.
Fair enough. I will stand down on that one.
I was gonna say, I like the robot birds as well. They kind of took the vulture fight from the first game and it's like, okay, let's just sort of like take this encounter and shrink it right down into a common enemy and just throw it into the game. And you know, it's just great to bring that variety to the combat, bring in that verticality to it.
I loved it too.
Yeah. I think like my favorite addition to this game in terms of mechanics, full stop, apart from the wingsuit, is the web launcher they've added for the stealth sections where you can basically shoot wherever you want. Similar to Batman Arkham, the Arkham games.
You can you can locate where you want to fire basically a web type, you know, a tight, tight rope kind of walk and then like go across it and then sort of do the drop down stealth attacks on enemies gives you a lot of versatility of around where you sort of like move in the game. I think that's a really cool addition to the stealth. I was curious to what you guys made of the fact that you can parry in this game, because I think that's like the the weirdest decision in it, I kind of get I still get the psychology at work of like, you want to do things that stimulate your brain in different ways, so the game does not feel the same as Miles Morales and the 2018 game.
But like, I wonder if that was like one thing, like a mechanic too far, maybe a little bit. Matthew, do you have a take on that?
I didn't mind it. The fundamental thing about the parry is it's quite a generous parry, which I quite like in games where I can just parry really easily. And I really like the follow up attacks that you can do after a parry.
The animation is absolutely amazing because you really slap people around. Even on bosses, if you land a parry, you can then get these big punches and the way they sell the kind of like aggression of those punches above your normal hits is like one of my favourite animation touches in the game. So it's like a net gain for me.
But I do appreciate that he isn't a brawler, you know, he's like nimble and the rest of his combat is kind of like death by a thousand cuts. It's like if you get punched in the face quickly 20 times, that's how Spider-Man brings you down. So the idea of like going mano a mano with like a giant bear man or whatever, it feels more like a Batman move than a Spider-Man move.
Yeah, that's the thing, like how much can you sort of like bend or bend the Spider-Man, you know, like combat, I guess, like, you know, sort of rage before you break it is kind of the question. And I think they bend it as much as they can with that, Parry. What do you think of that, Dave?
Well Sam, can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Do you like the combat in Spider-Man games?
So I think it is definitely like very good. I think one thing it lacks compared to the Arkham games is precision. So, because you are not aiming in this, you are kind of like where you punch is kind of where you are aiming in this.
And I had quite a few times where I had a bunch of enemies knocked down and I was webbing them up. But the in-game auto-aim was not aiming my webs at those characters and I didn't really feel like I had the agency to aim those webs unless I go into slow motion and do them manually, which is not really ideal. But I do also think that is kind of like a compromise they make to keep the scale of the combat where it is, because the battles are bigger, they take place in a wider playing space in the Arkham game, so they can't necessarily be as precise.
You are sometimes basically doing loops around the top of a skyscraper, so you have a massive wide open area, you need to be able to navigate as Spider-Man. So I get why they've made all the decisions they have, but I guess I slightly prefer that up closer combat experience where if you aim the stick in a certain direction, you're definitely going to do damage or fire an ability in that direction. Spider-Man lacks a little bit of precision in that respect.
What do you make of that, Dave?
I agree it lacks slight precision, but I do think in terms of these type of AAA action combat games, this is in the sort of upper echelons of combat. I think it's fantastic. I think the parry is good for all the reasons that Matthew said, but I never really had any of the problems that you experienced, if I'm honest, and I know it's all subjective.
You ranted to me the other day, foaming from the mouth about how you couldn't hit people with shields, and then I told you that you were playing it wrong, and then you blamed the game.
I think you agreed as well. So okay, let me just explain myself. Obviously I wasn't foaming from the mouth, unless I'd eaten like a big pizza beforehand, and it was heartburn at work, but yeah, very plausible.
Well basically, yeah, so how the shield enemies work in this game is you need to slide underneath them with the circle button. It's similar to how Batman would jump over them basically in the Arkham games. But you actually, like, what I was struggling with, I was hitting circle when I was next to a shield enemy, he wasn't sliding underneath them to then be able to attack them, he was just sort of like jumping around them, and you pointed out, Dave, you actually need to hit them with the square button first before you can then do the circle move that lets you slide underneath them, and I said, that's a little bit fiddly, and I think we both agreed that's basically because there is no actual manual aiming you can do in this game, so the square, actually, your punch has to function as your aim, and that's the sort of, like, I think that is almost an admission in itself that there is a tiny lack of precision with the overall combat flow in Spider-Man.
I'm not saying it makes it bad, especially as someone who really values intricate mechanics in games and definitely pushes back against games who just press one button to do a bunch of counter-attacks and beat enemies. Spider-Man is way more sophisticated than that, and I respect that, but that was all I said.
I just like to do a bit of character assassination live on the pod.
I deserve it, I deserve it, frankly.
But yeah, no, I totally agree with you. I think there are these very sly, almost imperceptible, like, areas of imprecision, but otherwise, as a whole, the combat system is just phenomenal, and I can play games like this all day, every day. I just love the way it makes me feel, how empowering it is, when it's smooth, like this is, and you can rack up combos over a hundred, and you feel like you still have variety in what you're doing constantly.
I'm going to use this gadget now, and then I'm going to transition to this move, then I'm going to airlift them, then I'm going to hit this bird over here, then I'm going to go down and throw this dot. All of that coming together, like, the depth to it, it's just phenomenal. And I think Insomniac have just done an exquisite job with this one.
I suppose elsewhere from the combat, we've talked about how there is a larger focus on scripted events in this game, and that's yielded some pretty amazing set pieces. The portal set piece we allude to earlier, without going too into it, definitely lifts from Matthew's favourite game Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart. The way it does that is, I think, is a pretty dazzling highlight of this game.
But there are numerous set pieces where there's great action pacing at work, things to get excited about and moments to get your blood pumping, and just really good, smooth examples of the form, just really well-constructed set pieces. It also means there are a few more of the notorious pat the ock sequences in this game, Matthew, where you are essentially in non-combat, narrative-based situations where you look at a bunch of stuff and then some cute moments happen. I was curious as someone who has enjoyed this game overall, how did you feel about those in this game?
I actually didn't mind them. I thought they're all quite light on their feet, none of them really outstay their welcome. I think it's partly the tone of this world is, you know, it's sort of comic book-y and bright and quite frivolous, you know, it's small jokey things.
I think the, you know, where I kind of got bogged down with this in other games is when you're sort of spending, it's the difference between spending those moments with good hangs and bad hangs, basically, and where I tend to bump into them is when you're forced to spend half an hour with like a very boring child as you ride an ox through a North Swamp, say, as opposed to like, you know, 10 minutes of like getting your balls busted by like your best mate and your girlfriend, you know, it's a slightly different energy. I think that they, they put a lot of like little mini games and goofy things like that. Like there's a real kind of playfulness and, and like love of love of games in this.
I mean, you know, one of the big standout set pieces is you kind of go around this carnival, but like every ride or everything you go to is like a bespoke mini game or activity. And so you are like interacting and playing with them and there's like scores to be gotten and everything. And I really like that.
And you know, it's fundamentally comes down to like, if you buy into the story, if you dig the story and that this was a bit more, a little bit more light hearted and it has its darker moments, but you know, I liked seeing these people, I liked, you know. I think also part of it's the surprise of going, like maybe seeing it in like that level of granular detail in an open world is quite exciting. Like that's, that's definitely part of it because this is a world which you spend so much of a time like swinging over it at speed and then occasionally it zooms right in and to my eyes, you know, in those moments, it is as detailed and nuanced as a Naughty Dog game, like graphically, like the level of detail in like the fun fair or like the offices and it sort of sells you on the idea of like, that's what this, you know, that is the level of detail in this world.
I mean, it isn't like these are the only places it goes into those granular details. But it that that's like, that's quite a fun trick. So maybe it's maybe it's more that than anything.
Maybe it's the putting those moments in something which is normally so macro is, is, is a bit more exciting, right?
I kind of feel like it just it lacked pretension in a way the other games that Matthew uses example there don't. It doesn't overstay its welcome. It's dealing with themes that I think are more resonant to the majority of people.
And you say it's not just like writing whatever that weird thing was in God of War, talking about stuff that is felt, you know, completely outside. Yeah, it felt completely superfluous with characters that you don't need an emotional connection to everything that Spider-Man is doing in those in those moments is building that connection between the characters because it has the same issue that the Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie had. It's like, here's Harry Osborn.
He's your best friend, even though we never mentioned him in the previous one, and you've never seen him before. And he's also going to, you know, have this turn at some point. And that's going to, you know, impact, impact people.
He was mentioned. He was mentioned. You found you went into that secret area in Osborn's apartment and found, like, Harry's gone to Europe and found out what was really going on.
Oh, okay.
You don't remember?
No, I don't. But you know, obviously, it's a passing reference then. But you know, it's not a key part of that story in that game.
Right.
So it has to do a lot to build that relationship up. And so when the events of the game happen, you know, over various hours that they mean something to you as the player and you feel engaged with it, I think the first God of War game did well in terms of doing it with Arthreus and Kratos, you know, focusing on those two, but it was when in the second game it was all these various other characters on the periphery that it felt sort of too in love with itself, whereas I think Insomniac still did a great job of just, you know, bringing all these characters into the center, either it being to Miles or to Peter.
That's fair enough. I think the only one I was a little bit like, can we get through this now was when you first go to the foundation that Harry set up and you sort of walking around that office and interacting with different computer screens. I was like, I can really do without this.
Like, I agree that the rest of them do sort of land. That was the one where I was like, who cares? And you're breaking up bits of protein or whatever.
I was like, I can again, I'll give that a hard hard pass from me on that one dog. But you know, it's like, again, it's not around for that long. So I can't really say it's that egregious.
I do like the I did like the Coney Island where I think it'd be hard, hard pressed and not like that. Then they should disable auto like disable the aim icon on the basketball and water gun minigames, though. That's my take is make those make those a little bit more skill based.
That's what I think. Yeah. Otherwise, I think I think as well, they're just like, they're obviously thinking a lot about pacing in this game.
Like, they, you know, they have a few different gameplay departures like like an MJ stealth section. I don't know if there's a second one beyond where I've got to. But, you know, the one they do is is is a lot better than the ones they do in the original game.
And yeah, these pauses are sometimes built in because it feels like they just need to give you a break from that cycle of stealth or like, you know, melee combat sections, which you're just which just become so familiar. And the side activities do some some great work to vary that up to, which we'll talk about shortly. So, yeah, okay.
Speaking of the Coney Island bit, you meet Mysterio there. Did you do you recognize the the actor playing the character?
The voice actually did ring a bell.
But no, no, it's the same actor who plays Bode in Jedi Survivor. And it's the same, you know, face model as well, basically, because it's, you know, the scan of the actor. It just put me off every time I met Mysterio in a game.
I was like, that's just Bode. Like, you just spoke. I just found it really distracting, which is no one's fault.
I've already I've already forgotten what Bode sounds like. I think you're gonna say like fucking Jeremy Allen White or something if I just do that.
Just shouting at you.
Yeah, I do like them. These are my illusions.
No, not tomorrow. You know, something like that. That's a really bad Jeremy Allen White impression.
No, I appreciate that. You can keep working on that though. Next time you come on, you can you can bring it in.
So yeah, I think that I do like that. There's a couple of bits and pieces in this with villains who are in like non villainous roles I quite like actually, they sort of give you a sense of the world moving on a little bit like Tombstone, for example, who I do not remember from the first game, honestly. But he's just like, yeah, I just work here.
I fix but I fix go-karts now. And I'm a good dude. And I'm like, fair enough.
You know, that's a big part of the story, both in the side missions and the main narrative is about rehabilitation and forgiveness. And so like, yeah, you get this sprinkling of these various sort of villains, even from the first game or just, you know, in general, Spider-Man lore is sort of, you know, going through this, you know, trying to live their lives outside of, you know, whatever criminal enterprises they were part of previously. I think that's a really fascinating take on a lot of those characters.
Because the easy route is just, oh, they broke bad again and they're now doing bad shit.
No, canonically, Craven has killed some pretty big Spider-Man villains now in this world. Like, they're not coming back, I'm assuming.
Yeah. Like, without spotting who they are, I guess. Yeah, I think that that's important to establish the stakes of the story, isn't it, I think.
Or to make Craven seem like a bigger threat than you might perceive him to be from his very daft outfit and his origins in the comic book. So, yeah.
don't worry. One problem I do have with Craven is the idea that Craven's the ultimate hunter, but it's like he's the ultimate hunter with 200 men. With all this equipment.
It's not actually- like, he gets his men to go and get all these people and bring them to him and then he easily kills them.
I don't-
like, he's not a lone wolf. It's not exactly- I don't know how many of his kills he can truly take responsibility for.
I'm the ultimate hunter, but I'm going to capture them, put them in a cage, release them in a very specific room surrounded by all my people, and we're going to use- and we're going to take all of their equipment and then like use it against them.
Well, considering like he's got this big sort of psychological streak to him throughout this game of like, I'm so unsatisfied by everything I kill, and it's like, well, you've really fucked the odds in your favor, that's why. The quickest way to make this more satisfying is to fire your entire organization, you know? But yeah, does anyone say this to him?
No.
He's got to bring that cost base down. Like, he's got so many staff, you know what I mean, a lot of equipment going on, and where's the income coming from? You know what I mean?
Like, it's a lot of questions there about Craven. I do agree, actually. Yeah, yeah.
You feel like you spend a lot more time with like, the sort of like, his, you know, his sort of sidekicks than you do him himself as well. You're just spending a lot of time with like, the same, you know, two to three NPC voices basically, but yeah. Okay, I'm going to tie these next two questions together actually.
So, the open world and how that compares to the original, is that fresh enough to just have a revamped layout of New York? We talked a little bit about that, like the idea that they've, you know, they don't make you dwell on the, on it as much, but I suppose if we talk about side activities here too, it's tying them to some kind of narrative element as they do with most of these, a wise move to make you more invested in them. Dave, what do you make of this?
Yeah, I think it's good. They kind of moved away from the focus on everyday street crimes into more like, interesting what I would describe as sort of like, friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man type missions. There is this sort of disconnect though, that, you know, you'll be swinging through and it'll be like, oh, there's a fire over here.
And you're like, no, I've got to go help an old geezer find his granddaughter again, you know, and it's like, I'm going to leave this burning building and do this side mission. That's a priority, apparently. But, but no, I, I think that was a really smart choice on their part to sort of bring a little bit humanized Spider-Man sort of every day a little bit more, and it's less about punching people and it's about the relationships he has with different, different people around the city going into the suburbs as well, helping an old lady, you know, figure out what's been disturbing her garden.
It kind of feels a little beneath Spider-Man, but at the same time, like, I really like that sort of connection to the community. And again, just like there's some really poignant moments within those stories. And I think that makes the world feel a little bit more alive than it otherwise did in the previous game.
Yeah, I get you. Every now and then I have those moments too, where it's like, you know, there's this getaway vehicle on the run, but wait a minute, I got to stop and take a picture of these two dudes playing chess kind of thing. Like there's a little bit of trade off that goes on in your head.
I thought some of those missions were very bizarre. It's like, you know, you take a picture of someone's like, hit someone on a bike. There's generally a photo opportunity where someone's run over someone on a bike and they're just arguing.
And then, you know, he goes to Robbie Robertson and he's just like, wow, New York City. It's like, okay. Is this going on the front page?
Like, where's this picture coming from?
Yeah. Back when I edited PC Gamer, I would send back my freelancers a long voice message about every single screenshot they submitted for a game. I'd be like, oh man, third person shooters.
That takes me back kind of thing.
As if freelancers ever supply screenshots.
Matthew, what about you in the, how do you feel about the side activities here? Like, do you think that they are a bit stronger overall than the first game?
Yeah. I mean, I haven't like compared numbers for numbers, but one of my problems with the first game was I love how they layer them on. So they're not all there from the start.
And as you go through a story, it puts more things in. But in that first game, it felt like you'd clear out an area and then, oh, now here's a new bunch of criminals have taken over a different bunch of rooftops. And then you got to the third act and they'd be like, oh, here's a new bunch of another bunch of criminals have taken over a load of rooftops.
And I felt like I was doing the same stuff too many times. And I just gave up on the side material in this one here. Like I don't think there's anything which has more than maybe like 10 examples of it in the map, which is is a really welcome restraint.
Like the fact that lots of people have 100% of this game and platinum it in like 30 hours. I think that's a good thing. That's a really good length for 100% in a game like this.
You know, I'm very likely, very likely to do that. But more to the point about that, all those individual strands tie into a character beat or maybe even a boss fight or set up for a future DLC or the next game. So that's a trait I kind of associate with the Batman games where it felt like some really fun juicy bits of Batman lore lay outside of the main story.
And so you just, you know, once you clicked into that, you're really encouraged to actually do them. And here, I don't think there's many things where I've seen it through to the end and I felt like, oh, that was that was unearned or a waste of time. You know, even things which look like quite flimsy fetch quests will, you know, can end with like, you know, a big villain hint for the next game.
And yeah, I, you know, I like I like that stuff, you know, the kind of current trend in collectathon games is the it's becoming harder to differentiate story content and side content. You know, that's definitely true in like God of War, some some of the best stuff is around the outside of that story. And I think it I think it's true here and it delivers enough on the the fantasy of being in that city and that city being full of things to do off, you know, maybe some of the individual activities I was a little like, like I love that I do love them.
Like I love them and the Mysterio setup. But then it's a little bit like they're challenge and that that that feels a little bit like 2005, like as an activity, like go to a place and have a fight and you're like, OK, that's fine. But generally, it was good, you know, I thought that the actual story side missions like the friendly neighborhood stuff and the there's some stuff about like following the trail of these arsonists actually had some really well written stuff in it, but I really like the story.
And I think the reveal is really satisfying on that one, too.
So it's a yeah, it's a it's a thumbs up for me. Like I'm not anti map checklist game, like I I've still got a lot of room for them in my heart. And I liked how sort of swift this this one was.
It does help when you have a familiarity with the world and like the the various characters that could show up at any of these times. So you know, it makes them feel less of a checklist when it's like, OK, well, I'm doing a challenge room, but it's a Mysterio challenge room. And so, you know, you may get some funky visual elements in there.
And yeah, that does.
Yeah, that definitely helps. And you'll definitely see them all through just because you want to see like, is this going to end with like a proper story mission or something cool? Or is it just going to be an unlockable costume?
Did you find that it was still...
There was a lot of teasing for things that will come in, you know, DLC or future games versus payoffs in the moment.
Yeah, that's if I'd say if there's a there's a like a mark against it, it is that like there's some there's some really cool stuff here like, oh, great, I get I get to deal with this guy now.
And then you're like, well, no, you can't wait to play that in five years.
It's a classic hush in Batman Arkham City thing, right? Like, that's the that's the first time I can remember seeing that, where it was like, you have this very brief encounter with hush, then you have to wait till the next game for it to pay off.
There's a few. Yeah. Have you done Sam?
Have you done? Have you finished the the chasing the metal birds stuff?
I have not actually. No.
Yeah, that's that. I quite like that. That's probably like the classic example of this in this where you're like, how's this going to really be anything because I'm just catching these birds.
You sort of chase them through these tunnels and then it suddenly gets very interesting and then just sort of ends on a bit of a cliffhanger and you're like, oh, god damn it. Like I would have liked to have seen that through.
I don't think it helped me was that was that was the last side mission I did after I completed the game. So it was like, oh, cool. You like kind of say you sort of rubbing your hands together like something something juicy is about to about to happen.
And then it's like, see you next time, kids. It's like, OK.
Yeah. Well, the last one I did was Mysterio, which is quite a spectacular.
I did that before I completed the main story. So it some of it does. It depends where it falls in your journey as to how satisfying it feels as a conclusion.
Have I reviewed Sam definitely hasn't. But Matthew, did you collect all the spider bots? I have the most.
It has a very weird conclusion to it that I had to read up about. And it's just I can't talk about it without ruining it. But it's just a very, it's not satisfying, but it's not satisfying for a very specific reason.
And it's kind of funny. But anyway, you'll have to. I think like a lot, it was surprising to me when I spoke to people about the spider bots thing that not many people kind of, even having collected like half a dozen of them, got what it was referencing straight away.
Whereas I think it very clearly alludes to a crossover with the Spider-Verse stuff, right? Because if you see it in the sky, it's pulsing with like a hexagon sort of like pink ring around it, which is the same shape from the Spider-Verse.
Yeah, I didn't make that connection.
I don't think that's a spoiler because I thought that was very visually obvious.
That's because you're a fucking dweeb. That's not something that normal people would do.
I've got kids, damn it. I've watched that movie like 10 times. Also, I've watched that movie 10 times because I fucking love it.
But, well, yeah, I think you'll find hexagons means multiverse, like you fucking do.
But the first one you collect is like a Spider-Man 2099 one. Anyway, I don't want to spoil it, but something happens at the end of that and it's kind of funny. There it resolves.
Yeah. Well, now that I've failed to finish the game in time for this podcast, I'm probably going to mop up those side activities before I finish the game proper.
So that's just a final point on those side missions for me at least anyway. There was something I really liked in the first Spider-Man game was you were doing one of those sort of like collector trails or whatever, like one of those checklist ones. And then Taskmaster just in the middle of one just like took you out from nowhere.
And it just started this big fight with Taskmaster that just, you know, it was completely, you know, random and really exciting. And I was like, what I was really hoping was that this game would do more of that. And it didn't do it once.
And I thought that that was something that the Arkham games, particularly Arkham Knight did really well, was like you'd be completing like a random, you know, side mission and then out of nowhere, like a C-tier villain would just come and start a big boss battle. And I would have loved to have seen more of that in this, but it just wasn't in there.
Yeah, it felt like it was taking steps towards that with like, when you bump into other Spider-Man and yeah, but I know exactly what you mean. Like that there's room, there's still room for improvement. There's room for like, you know, because it isn't side content.
If you can guarantee it's going to happen. It's worth doing.
Yeah. Interesting.
I will also say, just because I don't know if there's an obvious place to talk about, you know, as we talk about the city, it looks, it is an unbelievably good looking game. That city. Like I thought I'd sort of seen everything that they had to sort of say, like visually, I was, I had, you know, I had a certain thing in mind of like, well, you know, New York on PS4 is about as, that looks about as, looks about as good as it's going to get.
But like, like, you know, just the draw distance of it and everything, you know, when you're up really high and you look down and you can see all the individual cars driving around and like make out all the individual windows and stuff, like it's, it's, it's like one of the, one of the few this generation games where I have been like, holy shit, that looks unbelievably good.
Yeah. I had a moment where, when like, I think Miles was pinging back towards Sandman at the start and then firing past about like, I don't know, 18 skyscrapers on its way to, you know, a Godzilla-sized monster where my PS5 just crashed and I was like, yeah, fair enough. You know, like that would, there's like a lot going on there.
Like that's plausible to me that that would like push you to your limit.
You couldn't hit those shield guys anymore. So it was just like, I'm just going to turn this off and put him out of his misery.
Go fuck yourself, Dave. See, now people just get like a real idea of me and Dave's real life dynamic from listening to this podcast. I wouldn't tell like Simon Cardy that, for example, like just to be very clear.
Tell Simon Parking to go fuck himself.
Well, it depends how much our podcast will intensify in the coming years, Matthew.
The game is beautiful, right? But don't the teeth look fucking weird?
I didn't know this.
I can't help, like especially Harry, whenever he's, it's just these giant pegs inside his mouth that are just too big for it and it just really, it's like early Dreamworks animation.
That's teeth, man. You're describing teeth.
No, no, no, I'm describing like Shrek's teeth in size, a head that's like half the size.
Oh, fuck's sake. You're the one who called this a 10 out of 10, Dave. I'm not going to knock it down for the quality of teeth.
It's a 9 out of 10, but in the review column at the end in the negatives box, it just says one negative Shrek's teeth.
You fucked it, guys. I hope one of them's listed and then it's just going to be a concerted effort to fix the teeth for next time.
Matthew, am I right in thinking you're a big 30 FPS head in your next-gen games, right? Is that the same?
Did you do the same thing? Yeah, I'm a fidelity head.
Yeah. So, I don't know, maybe the teeth look better when you played it because it had like Rachel's teeth or something.
You can see their faces reflected in each one.
On that, it feels incredibly responsive at 30. It feels nice to play, the same with Horizon, and once you've got used to it, when you switch it into performance, you just see the detail drop out of it enough to bother you. So, that's what it is.
This is my fault for working on PC Gamer. If I'd just fucking stuck on console mags, I never would have cared about 60 FPS poison my brain.
I found when I played it on performance mode and switched to one of the costumes from across the Spider-Verse or whatever, and it has the sort of like stop motion, not stop motion, but you know, that animated style of animations. It made me feel really sick because having the sort of like incredible frame rate mixed with like this jerky character moving around in combat, it just made my stomach turn. I got really nauseous.
I had to switch back to another costume. Wow, okay.
Again, another one for your minus columning and turnout challenge.
Shrek, Shrek teeth and puke costume.
Oh dear. Okay, so I think there's an interesting discussion to be had about length here. So you can beat the story in under 20 hours.
I think I must be like in the third act where I am now, and it has ignited a tiny bit of a debate, I guess, about what, you know, it's a 70 pound game. What value do you get out of it? I think people are like finishing all the content of the game in around 25 hours, something like that.
So I don't think there's any way this game would be better if it was longer, personally. Like even for what I've played so far, I think there's a finite number of ideas, a finite number of times they can sort of play those ideas. Yes, there are things they could have done with the side content maybe to make it, make that, give that like a more compelling sort of crescendo, more boss fights, that kind of stuff.
But generally speaking, I think this year in particular, we're pretty grateful to have a game that surrounds 20 hours or less to finish. Matthew, what do you make of the length discussion around this game?
Yeah, I mean, dumb. I think it's really well judged. I think the balance of length to quality is just right.
You know, set before with the map, I think it's one of the better judged examples of like the amount of content. Like Spider-Man, Spider-Man 1 got to a point where I was like, fuck it, please, I just want this to finish. I don't know how long that game is compared to this, but like, I just didn't have any of those problems with this.
I enjoyed it all from start to finish, where Spider-Man 1 got to a point where I was like, I'm not doing any of that. Like the third act, I was like, just fucking just do it now, get it over and done with, get me to the last boss. This doesn't outstay us welcome, you know, for whatever reasons, it just works.
If I like, I mean, this is probably a side note, and, you know, I want to get into spoilery stuff for you, Sam, like, I do wonder if like, I do think compared to the rest of the story, the Venom stuff is a little rushed. Like, I feel like it just sort of happens quite quickly, and then you're like, oh, that was that. Considering the build up to it, and like how big Venom has been in like, the promotion for this game, and the fact they got like, Tony Dodd to do it, like, it didn't actually do much at all.
And it's quite surprising how fast it accelerates towards the ending. Maybe people are thinking, like, maybe that's factoring into some of this sense of like, oh, it's too short. It's like, maybe the, maybe the story is a little, a little rushed right at the end.
But then outside of that, I was going to say Venom is the third act villain. Like that's, that's when the third act kicks off.
But it's, but it's like, it has a similar, it's weird. It's actually has a similar structure to the third one where, to the first one where, like it feels like the stakes are raised in the third act that you are encouraged to hurry through it. It's like, we've got a big problem now, you got to go and solve it.
So even though you can go and fuck around and do all the other stuff, narratively, it feels quite unsatisfying to do that. So maybe it's, you know, maybe it's exactly what they intended that you'd speed through that ending. But like that narrative quibble aside, this has exactly the amount of stuff I want from one of these kind of games.
It's just so much fun throughout. Like I didn't not enjoy any of it, you know?
Yeah, what about you, Dave? How do you feel about the length side of it? Do you agree with Matthew on that?
Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, you know, I don't want to be another person on a podcast talking about their kids incessantly. But, you know, that was that was a dig at the big picture rather than any particular people.
They're allowed to talk about it. But, you know, it's hard to find time to play games a lot of the time. And so I appreciate when a narrative is, you know, pretty tight and I can get it done within, you know, 20 to 30 hours, to be honest.
Games that go beyond that, I struggle to get through before I want to play the next thing. But yeah, in this game's case, yeah, I think that it's a well structured story. I think once you're about where you are, Sam, it doesn't hold up.
It's a bit of a, you know, set piece, set piece, set piece, set piece, end kind of deal. And I think the pacing of it is just sublime. It's just fantastic.
And to Matthew's point, it is weird how little Venom is in it. And I did wonder why they even put him in any of the marketing instead of just leaving it for a surprise. But I guess as soon as you get a black suit Spider-Man, then, you know, you kind of know what's going to be coming.
So they might as well have, you know, leaned into it. But yeah, I think it's great. And the variety in it by having Miles in it as well.
So you're sort of you've basically got two stories that are running in parallel to each other keeps things constantly interesting that as you know, Venom turns up pretty late into it, but you're getting new villains coming into the story. It doesn't feel like you're just like in the first game, I think you were just constantly just going back and having another conversation with Dr. Octopus before he well, you know, before he turns into Dr. Octopus. And so it was just like this slow build up to the inevitable climax there.
Whereas this was constantly evolving the stories in a lot more interesting ways, I felt with more dramatic terms on a more regular basis. So for that reason, you don't, yeah, like, you don't feel that sort of, okay, let's just get our way to the ending. It didn't feel like there was any fat to this.
It's so lean.
Symbian powers are cool. I mean, they kind of like replicate the skill set you've already got a little bit, but like the feel of them is a lot nastier. And I think that really works and gives the game a nice shot.
I really like, and I don't know if you noticed this, Matthew, but the music changes as well as you explore the city as you become, as Peter sort of succumbs to the symbiote more and more through the story, like the sort of Raimi style strings that you hear a lot of as you're sort of, you know, making those great swings through Manhattan, like this like this darker tinge that comes to them and these other sort of sounds that start creeping in as he becomes more aggressive and sort of, you know, becomes part of part of the hive, as it were.
Yeah, I didn't necessarily jump out to it. But that's, yeah, that kind of level of detail that you do expect from these productions. I did actually have a question as people who are a bit more Spider-Man savvy than I about like how you felt the symbiote stuff kind of compared to other tellings of that story.
Because like Spider-Man 3, the Venom stuff is quite rubbish. I sort of understatement like it feels like a story that maybe needs like the length of a game to kind of do it justice. Like it's not something you can do in two hours because it's kind of a bit of a gradual change that you have to deal with.
I think the part that I really like the most is the fact that it's introduced via the Osborns. That the Harry kind of like sickness element is something I don't think I've seen before in like other media. And so the idea that he turns up and he's got these powers initially, at least, because, you know, they've used this alien thing to basically like stop his illness, is quite interesting because, you know, there are no goblins still in this Spider-Man universe yet.
They've got this Venom power first. And to be honest, I always consider this like quite a messy associate. This is quite a messy era of Spider-Man comics that looked amazing, but the writing was terrible.
And that's kind of like how I sort of like felt about that sort of like 90s. And sort of like the coming of Venom, Todd McFarlane stuff, like truly some of the nicest looking comics you'll ever see. But the writing was quite bad compared to the naughty Spider-Man comics I really got into.
But I think as well, I think it's a tough one to make compelling because it's not really a villain character at the center of it. It's all about kind of like corrupting Peter. And you can take that to some interesting places.
I think this game does a good job of that, of pushing his morality a little bit further. And also you get Miles perspective on that and MJ's perspective on that. So I think it's pretty successful.
It's definitely among the better versions of that that I've seen.
I think it's the best adaption of it for sure. Like tying it to his best friend and having them sort of have this sort of connectivity via the symbiote as well, I think. And the way they both interact with it and respond to it.
I think that's really smart story telling choice.
There is something quite funny that they do. And again, of avoiding spoilers. But like the symbiote, like it basically it seems that one of one of its side powers or how they represent it in this particular telling or this particular game is that it just makes it makes everyone become like very frank about what annoys them.
And there's lots of stuff, you know, a couple of people have the symbiote suit on them. And it basically just makes them kind of like unload their kind of domestic quarrels on people. Which I quite like that as a, you know, it's quite, you know, there's something kind of a little bit silly, a little bit kind of cute about it in a way.
But like it just makes, you know, all this stuff, which is sort of simmering under the surface with Peter Parker, you know, like he can't pay his bills or whatever. And it's like, finally, I have the confidence to say, like, no one appreciates me and I deserve more money and all this kind of stuff. And I, you know, I don't know if that's part of like Venom, the symbiotes like whole deal in this world.
But I liked that sort of bit of it.
That's the Tames version of it, you know, I don't want to clean the dishes.
There's also like the, you know, like the podcast and the radio that you like tune into every now and again. There's the podcast host, is it Danica?
Yeah, Danica, she's a tough one.
She is a tough one. Once you get the symbiote suit, she's like, are we sure this new Spider-Man is doing good? Like, I'm really scared, guys.
What's going on there? I'm like, what, he's punching people slightly differently to how he was punching people before? Like, what's the what's the deal here?
There's nothing he's doing differently other than like webbing them with goo, you know, and maybe screaming in a bit more of an aggressive tone.
Her podcast is fucking rubbish. It's the idea that you would listen to something. It's like whatever the exact opposite of Evergreen is.
Like, it's so reactive to what she can see out of the window. And then like you'd never go back to that bank of episodes and listen to it. Like, I just do not see what the value of that broadcast is.
Jonah is at least an entertainer, that's the thing, you know, like, he's really like, whenever his is on, like, I like there was a joke in Miles Morales about how Peter's hate listening to J Jonah Jameson, like, Miles is like, why is he listening to this on purpose? This guy slacks him off. But I quite like that, especially with the alternative was the Danica podcast.
That's why he was... She's a damn sicko, fam.
I think in-game podcasts are now, they're the new version of like, Rolling Your Eyes at in-game magazine covers. Where you used to look at a magazine and be like, oh, that no one, no one who's ever touched a magazine design that asset. It just looks terrible.
It's the same as that. They just do not sound like real podcasts.
Well, they're like 10 seconds long to start off. Like how is this, how is this being released?
It should be, it should be a 50 minute, I'm ranking the Spider-Man or whatever. And then I'd be like, yes, I'm into this. I would listen to that in-game asset for 50 minutes.
Yeah, exactly. And they'd have a good guest star on as well. It's just a one person podcast.
Like you're not Carina Longworth, love. You can't really pull this off, I'll be honest.
You won't remember this.
There's also this thing where like it starts, I'm like, right, if I could get to a side activity stat, then it will turn off. Oh dear. Now I feel bad for dunking on that a little bit too much, but.
No, it's fine.
I think that's how people listen to this, they're driving to their next destination. If I get there quick enough, I could turn this off.
Definitely like the guys who have said, like they're playing this in the car with their wives. I'm like, I bet they cannot wait to get off the fucking route today, you know what I mean?
Can we stop at the service station? Why? Just stop.
I just need to get out for like 50 minutes while this keeps playing. Okay, so last question I wanted to ask. The story does seem to be setting up a third game.
I've not finished it because I'm pathetic as established and was watching Silence. Andrew Garfield having a tough time in Japan. So how are you both feeling about the prospect of that?
I guess there's a few ways they could go with it. Dave, you obviously wanted to bring in 18 different, like increasingly contrived cameos, much like your beloved MCU movies do. There's also the potential that they expand this as a team, Spider-Man team proposition with the Spider-Verse kind of characters.
That's something they could do too. Matthew, I suppose before Dave overwhelms us with fandom wiki sort of stuff, where would you like a third game to go?
The end of the game is quite explicit about what the third game will be in terms of, oh, they're going to do this thing clearly.
I wouldn't actually object to a little bit more expanding of the cast. I think the end of this game sets itself up for like, there could be other characters in the mix, or there might be room for other people in the mix, you know, like, they're dealing with a slightly older Peter Parker and the idea that he could like stand aside, let someone else come in maybe, like, I don't know if I'd actually object to it. I quite like the cadence of like, big Spider-Man, little Miles Morales game that kind of like introduced that character properly, big Spider-Man game, like, even if they were to do another like in-between game to introduce another person to the mix of this, like, I wouldn't hate that.
Like, I've enjoyed what they've done with it so far and it feels like I trust the arc that they've clearly kind of planned out. I, you know, I like the trip so far, but I kind of fundamentally trust them with wherever they're going to take us next, which is not a very interesting take. But, you know, like in a way that I don't with, like, the makers of the Marvel TV, Cinematic Universe, whatever that's called, you know, like I don't trust those people.
You know, I wish they'd stop. These people, they're okay. They have my permission to continue.
Well, that is the thing. I think it does a really good job of making you actually made me excited about bits of the MCU that I'd like to switch my brain off to because I've been numbed by like two and three star content again, deep.
You did say you were going to watch Loki season two. Like you said, you pledged to me that. You can't break that.
I have four months left of Disney Plus. So that feels like something I should tick off just to get my money's worth. They spent loads of money on it.
I guess I should watch it. That's kind of how I see it really. A little bit.
But you have also said it's good, Dave, and I still trust your opinion, of course, via your opinion.
Hence, I gave Batman Quantum Mania like one star, you know, I don't love them all.
Okay, good. Well, I appreciate that. But what about you, Dave?
As someone who is more tuned into the Marvel stuff, what do you want to see from, you know, this game or even future games?
It's a weird one because this does feel so complete in a certain way, so comprehensive. I think the way it ends as well is sort of almost like a sort of nice farewell to these characters if it had to be. But obviously, it does set up a bunch of stuff for a third game.
And, I don't know, it feels like what they do suggest is the next part feels a little too similar to what kind of happened in one of the previous games without spoiling anything. I was like, okay, well, it's hard to envision what would be different about it this time. Right.
So again, I have complete faith in Sonyaq, like both of you, that they have a story in mind that will be both compelling and unique to these characters. But it's hard to imagine, like, if I had it my way, like complete fan dream, and it's not just like bring Tony Stark in and Captain America as much as much as I kind of love that. But I go into a different dimension with it, like take these characters out of their comfort zone into somewhere new, and then set the story around that where it's not the usual bag of tricks that they're drawing from and that they're in, it's this unfamiliar place.
You could, I mean, I don't know, take a leaf out Spider-Verse book, drag them into a different century and have to battle there. I don't know. But it's hard to see with everything they've done with all these characters.
There's the only missing, again, I don't want to spoil it, but there's like a key villain that's a missing piece, you know, that you mentioned earlier, which is the Green Goblin. Like bringing him in as a main villain, like would that be satisfying enough for a third game on its own? I'm not sure.
Kind of feels like, you know, they've done as much as they can do scale wise with all of the villains in, you know, that Spidey has to date. You know, I just feel like it's difficult to do a next step and make it and make it feel like it's a significant, you know, step above what they've already done. I'm rambling a bit, but I think you get my point.
Who is considered sort of canonomically or just amongst the fans, who is like the definitive Spider-Man villain? Like who is his Joker?
It is Green Goblin.
It is Green Goblin.
Yeah.
But like the thing is that they've done a little like based on the, like for me, it's always been Doctor Octopus versus Goblin.
Well, I think it's just because the initial sort of like run of Spider-Man comics by Stanley and Steve Ditko, you have like Norman Osborn and like Harry Osborn woven into it so deeply and then, and then like, I guess what I think that's a well because the Green Goblin is responsible for the death of Gwen Stacy a little later, but that that feels like the defining moment of the character. Yeah, true, true. But the thing is, they've done so much random shit with Norman Osborn since then.
I think he's like had Iron Man armor and he's been leading the Dark Avengers, all kinds of random bullshit that happens when comics have to like tell stories for like basically, you know, 60, 70 years. So it's a bit, it's a bit kind of like all over the place in terms of where those characters go. But I think historically, yeah, Green Goblin, you feel them, you feel them stepping around that as well.
Like they, they, it feels like they by starting with an older Peter Parker not showing you the death of Uncle Ben, all that stuff, and by not having the Green Goblin, it's restraint on purpose. It's like, you know, it's resisting doing the obvious thing. So yeah.
So answer your question, Matthew.
Yeah, yeah. I just, yeah, it was genuine question of not really knowing of like, is there a natural like, well, of course, this is what you'd be building towards.
That's it. I don't think there's a very, there isn't like even that like big, you know, it's not really a spoiler to say it has post credits and credits seems like the first game did and I think Miles Morales did as well. I don't think either of those necessarily point to a very obvious direction, to me, at least.
Yeah, it's tricky because it's not like having, you know, a dude going around on a glider lobbing bombs at you is necessarily like material where you're like, oh, yeah, I can't wait to play that third game. So yeah, it is tricky. It must be hard for me to figure out because they are trying to subvert your expectations.
So I mean, maybe the Wolverine game will give us some clue of like, you know, maybe where Insomniac is going more broadly, maybe they are pushing towards, I don't know, building their own kind of Marvel universe. I'd hate for them to be like locked into just making these games, but also they do such a good job with them. They're such high end blockbusters that maybe it would be the end of the world to have an X-Men game one day or X-Men Spider-Man team up.
Is there much X-Men Spider-Man crossover stuff?
I mean, like, it's like a moderate amount. Yeah, I mean, definitely there's definitely some a bunch of Spider-Man Wolverine stuff.
People love that combo.
Yeah, like, it's definitely like, I think that I honestly think the thing that unites them is that they are they were the big 90s Marvel properties, you know, like X-Men and Spider-Man, they had animated series, they were absolutely massive. And the character designs from the 90s were incredibly iconic. And I think like that, I think that's probably partly what drew, you know, Insomniac to those characters would be my guess, because they're generationally, that's that would make sense.
Right. So, yeah. Yeah, so I don't know if they've got like, it's not like you would read an X-Men comic and then every day, every week Spider-Man would turn up.
It's not quite that sort of deal. But they're closely connected as any other pair of characters, really. And they are like the big hitters.
Sam, I'll ask you again, because you're a comic book dweeb. The what the big Spider-Man event is like, what are the big story arcs that haven't been explored in the games that would likely this the next chapter be?
Gosh, it's quite hard to figure out. Because if you go historically, like I say, like the death of Captain Stacey and then Gwen Stacey is a big one. There is like the Clone Saga, which they don't want to go.
They won't want to go anywhere near that because it's obviously very, very confusing where they replace Peter Parker with Ben Reilly. Not a very well received storyline, but from a time when people were reading tons of Spider-Man comics. You've got like in recent years, things like Superior Spider-Man, where Doc Ock takes over Spider-Man's brain, which sounds dumb, but that run of comics is actually incredible, really, really good.
That would be quite interesting, but they've kind of done villain Spidey a little bit in this game. So I don't think you want to do anything like that. You've got like him getting married to MJ and then that marriage being destroyed.
But that was kind of like a comic book politics move at Marvel is very poorly received. They broke up this marriage and it stopped them from telling certain types of stories, which was seen as a bit of a shame by fans. Do you think other stuff really like there's like Craven's Last Hunt's a pretty famous storyline, Spider-Man No More, where he walks away from the role, which is what they do in Spider-Man 2, the Raimi film.
I don't know.
It just feels like a lot of it's dumb in one form or another within the set of games. Like the only other like big Spider-Man stories I think of are just crossover ones like Civil War, you know, where he's like an integral part of a much larger Marvel crossover thing.
Yeah, unmasked Spider-Man might be something they could do, but I don't know. It's yeah, it feels like again that the films have the films have done that too, haven't they? Like that's the whole point of No Way Home.
So yeah, I don't know. It's not that obvious, but that's kind of like what is good about Spider-Man at the same time. He is malleable because there are so many takes that you can live around those.
You don't have to do the thing that everyone expects you to do. You don't owe your fans anything because they can just go and find an interpretation that gives them the thing they want if they're really looking for that. So if they feel deprived of Goblin related characters, there's plenty of material out there for them.
So yeah, now I'm rambling, but yeah, good stuff. All right, good. Well, I think we're agreed anyway that this is a very good game.
Matthew, do you think it's going to get anywhere near your top 10 this year?
Oh, it'll probably make my top 10, yeah.
Okay, interesting. Well, yeah, I'll see how I feel at the end of it. Good stuff.
All right. Well, thank you so much for coming on the podcast, Dave. Is there anything you want to plug where people can find you and your Marvel rankings?
Oh, yeah. You can find me on x.com at Dave Scarborough. That's where I occasionally tweet from.
Gosh, is it still called tweeting when it's called X? That's very confusing.
We've gone into this before. We're not prepared to debate that whole X thing. But yes, people can find you there, which is good.
