Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I've eaten far too much fish pie before recording this podcast, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew, how's it going? It's a Sunday evening pod. You've been playing two games all weekend, alternating between Avowed and GTA Vice City, both of which will be discussed in an upcoming podcast.
The GTA game will be discussed in a Patreon podcast, and Avowed will probably come up in the what games we've been playing in the middle of the month. How's it been going?
It's been going well. I had a bit of a minor shit fit with Vice City halfway through the weekend and threw my toys out of the pram on Blue Sky with my big old baby, and then kind of calmed down and collected myself and then pushed on for the good of the podcast.
It's what Tommy Vercetti would do, you know?
Yeah, very, very much so. There's a lot of people losing their cool in that game. So, yeah, that makes perfect sense.
But I will reserve any juicy observations I have for the Patriot episode. And I've been playing of Vowld, which I like. It's pretty low-key.
It's kind of chill. There's lots of climbing, which I wasn't expecting. You kind of climb around giant towers and caves, and every bit of the map seems to have a little thing you can climb and find a glowing thing.
So it's been quite a fun clambering around exploration game.
They've thought a lot about how movement and combat feels in that game, which is, you know, maybe low-key is the right way of putting it. But that's kind of the best thing about it, I think, is that when you compare it to something like Obsidian's, I don't know, maybe their previous game, The Outer Worlds, or definitely like Fallout New Vegas, they feel like very modern sort of combat and movement mechanics, you know, and it really just smooths the ride out a little bit.
The second you talk to an NPC, though, they've just got this like 15 years ago ass look to them in their faces. So I'm like, oh, still these guys, they're still kind of made out of the same box of eyes, noses and mouths that I recognize.
It sounds picky, right? But I think I've just been playing games so long now that I really notice the Unreal Engine when you cut from one scene to another, like the hair sort of dropping down where the models kind of get into place. And you really notice that in a valve when you skip dialogue, you tap through it, you just see the hair constantly going.
Kai's vest is constantly adjusting itself.
Yeah, materials just all, yeah. And I just wish I could switch the part of my brain off that notices that, you know? It's sort of like in films, I don't feel like I notice this as much, give or take Robert De Niro in the car at the beginning of a casino blowing up and it clearly being a little toy, man.
Like that's, you know what I mean? Like it's-
Stikendal.
Yeah, basically. But I've just been playing games so long now that I spot that stuff every time now. There's a transition in the cut scene and god damn, why do I have to ruin it for myself?
But hey ho. Well, more on that to come. But Matthew, you also plug something at the beginning of this episode, right?
An impending Kickstarter finale.
Yes. Yeah. So this is a Kickstarter for a project I'm a tiny bit involved in.
We'll be more involved in if it passes the Kickstarter. It's called Ludo Scene, which some people may have heard of. I mentioned it on the Discord.
It's the project led by a guy called Andy Robertson, who's a video games journalist, not to be confused with Andy Robinson of VGC. He's been around as long as I've been doing this. Runs the Family Games Database.
And what that was, was basically a big list of family-friendly games. But in listing those games and documenting games for the database, they started creating this huge library and now they've created this thing called Ludo Scene, which they're kind of describing as Tinder for game discovery, in that you pick games you like and it starts suggesting other games you may like based on that. Where I fit into the equation and lots of alpies is you can pick experts who will further shape the kind of algorithm.
So, you know, you can pick me and it will start kind of putting in lots of detective games that I've handpicked and I guess at the heart of it, you know, it's game discovery presented in a slightly fun way in that there's this sort of swipe left, swipe right stuff going on, but also where everything is AI dependent and AI led, there's quite a beating human heart at the center of it. Lots of people have been hand documenting these games and lots of experts have been hand picking their lists to help further suggest things. So yeah, it's a cool little thing.
I think it's doing okay on Kickstarter. It's got like another week to go by the time you listen to this. It intends to launch as basically a free service.
So what you're doing is you're funding the production of something. You know, it's quite an altruistic act to give it money. So I can understand why people would look at it and go, well, I'll just wait for other people to fund that and I'll just have it, you know, where actually it won't probably hit the funding unless more people chip in and jump in.
So anyway, if you look it up, it's called LudoScene. That's L-U-D-O-C-E-N-E. If you look that up on Kickstarter, you can read all about it.
You can watch a video of it in motion. Like I say, I'm kind of vouching for it, but, you know, full disclosure, I will get a little bit of money to write up some entries for it if it all does go through. But I do think it's a cool thing and I hope that one way or another it comes to be.
So, Ludo seen on Kickstarter, give it a go Back Page people.
Yeah. So if you want to check that out, I will link it in the Patreon post that goes along with this episode, patreon.com/backpagepod. That's a free to read post if you want the link.
I'll also link it on Blue Sky and Twitter as well, so you can see it there. And Matthew will recommend you Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, no matter what else you do.
That is 100 percent something that will happen if you click on my card. Well, the funny thing is, is you can select stuff you don't want recommended if you're an expert too. So I can tell it not to serve up all the shit that usually gets served up when you look for detective games, but I don't think very good.
So that bit's quite good. If it tells you I endorse it, I really do.
Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, that sounds like a good project. And yeah, like you say, some very interesting people involved certainly in this.
I mean, if you think about how bad recommendations are on Steam, the algorithmic recommendations on there, or how hard it is to find anything on the Nintendo eShop, there is definitely room for something like this to exist. But like you say, it depends on altruism. So yeah, we'll have to give Andy a hand there if anyone wants to support that.
So good stuff, Matthew. Now to plug ourselves. So this month of the podcast, it's March, obviously, and this is a mailbag episode you're listening to.
So we've got a stack of listener questions we're going to go through. Our first mailbag episode since November, so we've got quite a lot of new stuff here. Thank you for everyone who's supplied a question.
If you'd like to supply a question, you can email us at backpagegames.gmail.com, but most people send us questions via the pod questions bit of the Discord, which you can access from our profile at backpagepod on Twitter or BlueSky. There's a little link there to be invited and join. More than a thousand people in there and about 20 people who actually post.
That's the Discord, so good stuff. I wish them all well in the truest sense. So that's this week's episode.
And the next episode after that is going to be on March 10th. That is our Two Giant Men play GTA Vice City episode that Matthew has gone through great pains this weekend to power, basically, with his takes. So look forward to that.
I have yet to play it properly. I've done that little golf cart mission, Matthew, early in the game. I've got a long way to go.
So that'll be one of my jobs this week in doing actual work.
I managed to jump over the fence with a gun for that one so I could just shoot him from miles away.
That's a great idea, actually. Yeah, it did take me three attempts. And then I think the first attempt, the car, which was nearly impossible to control, just went into the sea and I was like, oh yeah, PS2 GTA games, this is what they're like.
And then it was an instant mission fail. And it's like, yep, this was what it was like. So yeah, I look forward to that being an absolute bloody sort of like stumble to the finish basically for both of us.
And then we have to do the same with San Andreas in June, so that's good. Okay, next regular episode then, the Nintendo Switch draft with returning guest, Catherine Castle. That should be fun.
Yeah, March 14th for that one, three-way draft as we come to the end of the Switch generation. Feels like the right time for it. All we're gonna really miss out on at this point is a Pokemon game that neither Matthew nor myself really care about and the Xenoblade Chronicles X remaster.
So it should be all right. I'm looking forward to that, Matthew. And then we have a What We've Been Playing episode, which should feature Assassin's Creed Shadows.
If we can get keys for that one, we'll have a go. Pirate Yakuza game that came out and seems to be slightly divisive with that community. And Split Fiction, the new co-op game from Haze Light Studios.
Probably avowed as well, as we've mentioned, and probably a few other things too. March 21st for that one, Matthew. And then XXL episode, another Patreon episode, Patreon exclusive.
Bong Joon Ho movies ranked. There is a new movie from this Korean director out, Mickey 17, with Robert Pattinson very shortly. We're going to basically just talk about all of his films in an episode.
So yeah, March 24th for that one. And finally, the best and worst game set in the UK, with cursed British awards for each one. That's coming on March 28th.
That's a tie in somewhat with Atomfall, but we thought rating the Britishness of different games might be fun. What do you think of that lot, Matthew?
Oh, it's a pretty good selection. Quite a lot of playing has been done for what we've been playing, and I imagine there's still a lot of playing to go. I've been watching lots of Bong Joon Ho films, playing Vice City, lots of homework, but hopefully it will be worth it.
Yeah, I did message Matthew yesterday and say, do I set too much homework for the podcast? I think you were like, yes, but it's fine, basically. I think that's the right response, and I was like, yeah, okay, fair enough.
I've come up with some more low-lift ideas, Matthew, to take us through to June. That will slow things down a bit, including, I just came up with an episode today that I pitched Matthew for April, which is going to be like the lukewarm exclusives hall of fame. What I thought we could do is similar to when we did that Indiana Jones thing where we did everything from S-rank down to D-rank of all the stuff.
I thought we could just do that for a whole bunch of different exclusives. The idea being that at the very top in the S-rank, you have the near misses, the almost great exclusives, but not quite, and then at the very bottom, you've got NAC basically. What was that really cursed third-person Xbox One game?
That ex-Capcom bloke that Inafune was involved with, Rekor.
Oh, Rekor.
I mean, great content across the shot, but less playing for Matthew to be done. So that was the goal there basically. So yes, that's what's coming up.
But for now, we've got a mailbag episode for you. So Matthew, do you want to jump into our first question?
Lads, are you ever secretly or not so secretly happy when one of the year's big releases reviews poorly so that you don't have to play it?
Yes, is the answer to that from me. I think we've got slightly too much pressure on ourselves to deliver with the podcast and play everything on those end of year podcasts in particular. I was quite relieved recently when Civ was shrugged off somewhat by critics, even though I'm sure Firaxis will improve it over time.
But it ended up with like an 80 on Metacritic, which I assume is quite low for Civ as it goes.
Yeah, I mean, still quite good for you with your fancy critic draft and quite bad for me because Fable has been pushed back a year. So that's basically I've lost. So that's good.
Yeah, and you are also at the mercy of What's It Coming Out This Year, aren't you? Silk Song. So we just cannot guarantee that that will happen.
Lazy, lazy bastards.
Matthew values productivity above all else, as well.
Too much laziness in this industry.
Amazing. Matthew has gone full shit lord over this. So yeah, what do you think, Matthew?
No, because to be honest, I like to see these things for myself a bit. That may sound incredibly untrustworthy of me, but that's how it goes. If anything, it's quite rare that things do get absolutely mullered these days.
So when it does happen, if anything, I'm more curious to play it just to see, did people get it right? Slitterhead scoring quite badly made me really want to play it because I was like, well, I've got to see this for myself clearly. So yeah, no, the exact opposite of this, in fact, very annoying.
Well, I would say that checking out is one thing, but sticking with it is maybe another.
That is true. Yeah, there's lots of things I've played an hour of on Game Pass just to make sure it wasn't for me.
Matthew's example there about Slitterhead being reviewed quite poorly is a good one. I've got a similar comparison point to that, which is that Eternal Strands game that came out this year. So I think I got 69 on Metacritic, which is unfortunately low and I'm sure I feel bad for the devs.
So I hope the game at least does what they need it to to keep going as a studio. But it was also interesting to see critics going to Battlefront and be like, well, this is really interesting despite its flaws. Yeah, that will definitely at least get me to give something a chance.
But yeah, but also it can be a relief when a sort of an entry in like, for example, with Elden Ring, Night Reign was got like 75 and it won't. It just fucking won't obviously. But let's say it did.
I'd be like, oh, good. I don't have to be like if people on the internet go, oh, this is the greatest multiplayer game I've ever played. I will be I'll just be so annoyed if I feel like I have to check it out.
Do you know what I mean? So like this, there's a bit of that to it as well.
The perfect example of this is when The Last Armored Core came out. I had no interest in it, but there were just a couple of the reviews were so glowing and were so well-written. I thought, well, I've got to try this for myself and see.
I absolutely fucking hated that game. Played about three hours of it and haven't touched it again. It's just scores aren't universal, are they?
They're not for everyone. I should have read more carefully and considered who was saying these things.
Yeah, and you know, with the Armored Corps boys as well, they're only pretending they've played these games since the PS2 days. You know what I mean? They haven't really played this since then.
What about more Tars and Bits?
Well, I don't feel like I've touched that one since the end of 23, so I think I'm within my rights to give that one a reheat.
Dust it off.
Okay, next question then. Quite a long one for quite a simple question if you ask me, but I'll read it out anyway. Thank you, Dr. Van Nostrand.
I love you really, kind of. Okay, hi Sam and Matthew. Reading the Eurogamer Top 100, I can see that Katherine has written a lot about games that Matthew likes and obviously the two of you have a lot of crossover in terms of the games you enjoy.
I'm an incredibly thin-skinned person who resents being given recommendations because it can feel like homework. I mean, even past like what you want to play or whatever anyway, but will be deeply offended if someone doesn't take mine. If it isn't too nosy and you feel comfortable talking about it, Matthew, I'd be interested to know how you and Katherine have gone about influencing each other's tastes and in particular, how you navigate the giving of recommendations, particularly if they sometimes end up being ignored or one of you ends up hating something the other person loves.
Thanks. Like I say, Matthew, a long version of quite a simple question. So yeah, what's that dynamic like?
Well, the really boring answer is that we have quite similar tastes. We're both big Nintendo heads, which means we generally end up liking the same big Nintendo games, as do all other Nintendo fans. We're quite a uniform bunch, really.
There are things we don't see eye-to-eye on, but that doesn't matter. We're two individual people, we're not like some weird hive mind. Catherine's a bit more open to…
or a bit more interested in mining indie fare. I think that probably goes back to being on RPS and RPS championing this stuff and not necessarily chasing the big mainstream titles always, whereas I am like an absolutely creature of the mainstream. I will play a 100 hour AAA RPG rather than try 20 new indie games, which Catherine will probably do the reverse of.
So that's how we differ. I mean, in terms of when we disagree and we disagree on stuff all the time, it's absolutely fine. The good thing about being married to a reviewer is that she's really good at explaining her point and thinks about things and has really thoughtful takes.
You know, she isn't just some internet shit lord going, I hate that, and just leaving that to stink up the joint, you know, which is just meaningless. She will often tell me about the things she's playing. I think recently the big one is, I came to the conclusion that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was all right and quite interesting, quite compelling, where she really, really hated it.
And that's, you know, that's just one of those. That's absolutely fine. I read a review and thought really well written.
Points were really clearly made. So that's how it works.
Indeed. Recently, there's been a bit of discussion over a VGC. Astrobot review, the headline reads, Astrobot is the best 3D platform in a decade, including Mario Odyssey, presumably, but the review text doesn't push that so hard.
When you both wrote for websites or worked for YouTube channels, how much control did you have over the aspects people would see before? Or they clicked on the link. I'm thinking titles, subtitles, thumbnail, and if relevant, shudder SEO text.
Were they all you or did somebody else handle them? And if the latter, how much input did you have? That's some balladeer.
Obviously, recently is no longer true because Astrobot came out months ago. This is a bit of an old question, but I thought this was worth talking about anyway, Matthew. Quite an interesting process question.
What's your answer to this one?
Yeah, I feel like I've been insulated from this a little bit in that I worked in print where my job mostly was about all the fun stuff inside and the only real equivalent of this was the cover in the wallet where you try and simplify the messaging or make it sound as punchy as you can. That is the closest thing you get to magazine SEO is move over, uncharted, here comes sonic boom. And yes, I didn't have a natural ear for that.
I've never worked out right on a website because I went from print to video. Actually, YouTube is an interesting one because while it's got loads of bad practices that people hate, like the thumbnail of people screaming, the clickbaity titles, yes the fact that video descriptions are full of SEO search terms, I would also say it doesn't really matter, like if the video itself holds up and definitely on RPS, I thought the videos which it was my job to make were my voice saying what I wanted to say and people in the comments seemed to agree with that, seemed to enjoy them and appreciate the work. Did I then dress those up to try and give them a fighting chance?
Yeah, absolutely, because you have to, because it's a bit of a fucking fighting in the mud on YouTube to get anything to break through when you're a smaller channel trying to grow its audience. We would never lie, but I made all the thumbnails, titles, I did all the video descriptions for everything on the RPS video channel when I was running it, and I had no qualms whatsoever because I had absolute faith that all I had to do was get someone through the door into the video and then they'd enjoy the tone of voice and they'd enjoy the content, they'd enjoy the analysis, hopefully. And so I kind of always thought, well, it doesn't really matter.
I don't really care what the packaging is because that's the bit I want to get you to. And if I have to call it, like every video on RPS is just like seven good things about this or ten bad things about that game or whatever, because people like numbers, because people like big broad messaging. They don't like to hear, oh, this is going to be confusing and in the middle ground.
So that's how I dress those videos up. And I never had a complaint about the gulf between the title and the thumbnail and the video itself. So people just bought into it once they clicked.
But I'm lucky in that regard. I've not had to do like the proper SEO minds ever, which may be your better place to talk about.
Yeah. I mean, the thing is, I did go through the... I had quite a lot of control over the actual headlines.
But I suppose what the question is maybe getting at is the idea of what are the kind of invisible pressures that go into those headlines. And there is a bit of that in the sense of, you know, you certainly on TechRadar, there's a lot of writing for certain Google terms. It's, you know, I started a series that was basically like, what are all the Netflix, Amazon Prime shows out this weekend, for example.
And I came up with a headline format for that, that would literally do hundreds of thousands of page views a week. Until Google decided it didn't like TechRadar anymore and gave it a kicking for no fucking reason. That was good.
So, and then I left shortly after that. So well done to that tech giant. Congratulations on your definitely meritocratic search algorithm.
It's definitely working very well. Yeah, but it's funny because I definitely think that what Matthew says is true, that you are trying to create a container for your otherwise more reasonable points. What I think is more worthwhile pointing out here is that websites have been trapped into this by Google.
They don't want to do this. No one wants to do this. No one wants a shouty headline.
But it's created this really negative cycle of anytime you see a shouty headline now, normally people are responding to the tweet that links to the headline and the story. And they're going, oh, fuck off with this headline. What's happened is that people are so worn down by those headlines now, that it's created this incredibly hostile reader relationship with that type of headline and arguably with websites somewhat as well, because they see that as hostile or somehow overstepping.
And I understand why, but also those websites do need to do that. It's like it's how you get Google search traffic or Google discover traffic, which is where a lot of big splashy headline stuff goes. But it's come to this point now where I think even like so recently, Eurogamer started publishing more op-eds recently, which I think is good.
I like seeing more of them making calls on when there's an Xbox event or a PlayStation event, like where those manufacturers are out is traditionally what Eurogamer has been very good at. But even like quite mild headlines, people in the comments fucking complaining about it, and it's like, well, they're kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't really. So I really do sympathize because you just cannot write anything without some motherfucker complaining.
People are just so negative towards websites now. So it's not easy, it's not ideal. I've definitely been in positions where I've like, the headline has become a lot shoutier than it was maybe intended to be because, again, it was that thing of like, I don't know.
And a commissioning editor says, I like these headlines, but what if it was a little bit more like this? And you do end up getting something that's maybe a little bit more sensationalist than you were perhaps originally intending. So, you know, my prime example of this, and I've mentioned it on the podcast before, I went with, I wrote a piece that was Sekiro, who has ruined all other hack and slash games for me, or was it action games for me, something like that.
And it was talking, I think the point is about 75% true. It hasn't ruined all games outright, but this was when I was playing Ghost of Tsushima and just couldn't quite get that same responsiveness and feedback that I wanted. And I definitely thought I was craving the Sekiro combat system in everything.
And, you know, I got my wish eventually. Every game has it now. And maybe I'm a bit cooler on it.
But that headline was originally a lot more watered down. And it was interesting, I think a fellow writer even said, like, I wouldn't have gone as far as this headline does. But I do agree with the text.
And, you know, it's interesting. You find yourself in those positions. But the piece was read by more than half a million people.
So it does work, unfortunately. So, yeah, I think that probably answers that.
Yeah, I mean, you've definitely had a lot more hands on experience with this.
Oh, yeah. Burned out on this kind of nonsense, really. That's that's what did my head in ultimately with with media.
But yeah, do you want to read the next one, Matthew?
Yeah. Dear juicy lads, a question about the inner workings of being a staff writer on a magazine. If you were allocated a big 80 hour game to review, how did that impact on your working week?
Could you hide at home for two weeks and work through it? Would you still have to fit in office meetings and other obligations? There didn't seem to be the same work from home culture in the noughties, tens and a lot of the anecdotes on the pod indicate a big office presence.
So I'm curious as to where and when staff actually reviewed big games within their working week. Thanks for all the great content and laughs. Back Page is 100% my favourite podcast and Discord community.
Thank you very much, Stevie.
Yeah, this actually triggered memories of lugging debug units of game consoles back and forth from my flat to the office, Matthew. Because often it was your spare time being shredded by the workload, you know? It was sort of not a waste, but I would say a lot of the time there was an expectation, especially if you've got a deadline coming up or something like that, that you would take a game home for the weekend.
And I don't know, it was a bit of a... I don't know if anyone ever demanded I did it, but it was definitely a thing of like, well, you've got this to do and I need it in by Monday, is that okay? You know what I mean?
Like there was implicit pressure. It was a bit sporadic rather than the norm, you know?
I feel so much of what we were doing back then was fueled by pride or fear of shame, you know, and the idea was if you worked on a magazine, even for one issue, you understood the time pressures and how limited resources were to make any magazine happen. So it got to a point where I think you understood your workload. So if you got given a big game, you might start calculating, well, I can give this a couple of days of in-house time, but I'll probably write it later in the month and just chip away at it in my evenings and weekends.
Because the alternative is, if you put your foot down and go, I'm not working at home, they're like, alright, well you can have those two days and good luck writing about a hundred hour RPG when you've only played twelve hours of it. And whether or not that is right or wrong, like what powered those decisions in my head anyway was will I want to be thorough and I took a lot of pride in my work and I didn't mind putting in the time because these were things I would be playing anyway, things I wanted to play anyway. I see a lot of people kind of chastising this kind of behaviour and sort of saying like, well it's unacceptable that you know, you get paid so little and you have to do all this work and that is true.
But like there are just a few sort of demented souls who sign up for it. And kind of impose it on themselves. Like I work with people who weren't doing that game playing in the evening.
They just, you know, roped from like lesser point of information sometimes. And they were fine with that. Some older stuff, I should say.
But all the youngins were, you know, we were just, this is what you did. Like if you wanted to review the big shit hot game, you know, you wanted to kind of show you had the stuff.
What's the term? Gristle for the Mill? Was that the term?
Yeah, I don't really know how I feel about it because I see lots of people saying like, well, just because you did this, you can't enforce this on like the next generation. You're like, yeah, that's true. I do agree with that.
But at the same time, I don't feel any anger towards my editors back then. I love the culture. It was just what I did.
I don't know. Maybe I'm properly broken, but.
Yeah. I mean, if it helps, I would say I sometimes did this, but I would say I did base it on the game itself. If I saw it as six out of ten stretching out into the distance, I was like, you know what?
Maybe I will review Star Ocean 4 on the Xbox 360 after 10 hours of play rather than 50. But obviously, if it's Mass Effect or GTA or Final Fantasy, I'll take it home and finish it. I definitely did a bit of that to ease the pressure on myself.
Yeah, that's absolutely true. But you could also just gauge things based on page counts and, you know, you obviously weren't going to spend 100 hours on something that you'd only deign to give half a page or something. But if you had like eight pages to write, you were like, well, I'm going to have to have some fucking considerable thoughts to actually fill this.
So let's not make a fool of myself and let's put that off till later in the month. I liked having the time to manage my own time. I liked knowing what I had to do in a month, you know, my 30 pages or whatever, and being able to tackle them in an order that made sense to me.
Yeah, there's definitely like times where the expectations were just totally out of whack or like you didn't have the staff and it was like, well, you have to do this anyway. And we clearly have not given you enough freelance budget to cover the staff you've lost at this time. And that's probably where I was more annoyed by it.
But I do agree with Matthew that it was a bit different. I mean, it feels a bit, everything feels a bit more life and death now. Just because, you know, everyone works on websites now rather than magazines.
So it feels like it was just so close to like the end times all the time. But for the first like four or five years, I worked on games, magazines. They were not really shrinking in team size.
It was not really like a massive pressure, like in terms of, well, this is going to end soon. It was just, it was a bit of a bubble. You sort of got, you were invested in the work you were doing, like Matthew says.
And I don't know, I did sort of see a review of GTA IV as, this is a signature piece of work by me. I've got to do a good job with it. So, I would say as well that that has given me quite a lot of, I've got a great work ethic as a result of working in pre-media.
My big boss there said to me, oh, like, you'll see that when it gets to a game launch, it'll be harder than anything you did in media. And I was like, I don't know. I mean, let's see.
And then she asked me afterwards, like, how had that compared to work in media? I was like, media's a lot harder than that. Imagine that, but every month, that's what, like, basically media is.
Yeah, and you get paid a third of what you're paid.
Yeah, so that was funny. Not to sort of laud it over people by being like, well, I worked harder than you. And I do emphasize the people who talk about, like, oh, you know, I sort of like, I will only do X amount of work and I'm only getting paid for those hours.
That's entirely your choice to make. What I will say is going through print media gives you just so many great applicable skills for the rest of your career, like project management and being comprehensive, having pride in your work, getting things done in a short space of time, going out of your comfort zone to write things you might not normally write. It gives you everything you need to succeed.
So, yeah, that's, but also, you know, that's it. That's my perspective on it, really, Matthew. But, yeah, okay, good.
Next question then. Dear Samuel and Matthew, can you think of any game reviews you've read and disagreed with, but still think an excellent piece of games criticism or any reviews that made you change your mind about a game? I remember Samuel saying an Angelica Jade Bastion review of Poor Things, got him to reconsider that film.
Great work on the pod as ever. I hope I'm pronouncing her name there correctly by the way. Also, who is your favorite fictional character that shares your first name?
Who is your least favorite fictional character that shares your first name? Has anyone ever named a fictional character real baby or real pet after you? Dear God, I hope not.
Thank you for a great pod from me and my son, Sam Hugh Matual. That's from Naistlin, Matthew.
A little comic payoff to that letter.
Yeah, very good. There were two questions from Sean here that I just welded into one. I thought they were both pretty good.
Yeah, I couldn't think of one for games, Matthew. I thought I should give a bit of context for that Poor Things review for people. So this is on Vulture, which is a website I like a lot.
It was a perspective I hadn't thought about. It's a film I enjoyed. I didn't think it was the best film of that Oscar season, which was the one that was last year, the Emma Stone film with Mark Ruffalo.
Mark Ruffalo is very funny in that film. It was written by a guy who created the great and wrote the favorite, Tony McNamara. There was just this great piece about it that was a perspective I never would have had or thought about.
But they said, there's a corroded spirit to the story. You really need context of what the film is here. It's intermittently possessed by an edgelord who's unaware most women menstruate and an early-wave white feminist who believes having sex is the most empowering thing a woman can do.
Brackets for all the fucking, there is no menstrual blood. In many ways, the film demonstrates the limits of the modern cis male auteur's vision for and about women, particularly their sexual selves. Now, guess what?
That's not something that I could write in reviewing that film, and fair play. But I liked it because I actually did think there was a little bit of a whiff of bloke in his 50s Twitter feminism about it. And I think it just pulled out, kind of pulled at that wound a little bit.
And so it did it did sound on the film a tiny bit, but it may just maybe reconsider the film a little bit, you know. Having said that, Matthew, I've never really had this with games. What did you think?
Probably the best recent example or the most striking recent example for me is I didn't get on particularly well with immortality. I think I'm just a little bit too basic for it. And that isn't me doing like a pull me.
You know, I think what it was trying to do and the films Sambalo was kind of referencing and the kind of register of it were all things that I don't necessarily like gravitate towards. And a lot of it went over my head and I didn't really have a good time with it. But I absolutely love the Edge review of it.
And I feel like I kind of understand that game or what I understand about that game. I understand from that review, which was someone who 100% clicked with it. Edge gave it a 10 out of 10.
And so it isn't the case of like, well, I don't disagree with that. Like, I don't feel like I could really score Immortality, but I thought that was just an absolutely stonking bit of a review. So, yeah, that's a good example of that.
Like a slightly softer version of this is just over the years. Martin Robinson's writing about shooting up some New York Game I've really liked. I find that he pitches a genre which is often in the hands of slightly kind of obnoxious gatekeepers.
And actually he really kind of opens it up in a fun way and lures you in and makes you want to play these things if you haven't already. What better work can you do as a games writer than that, really?
Yeah, the one thing I would add from my side to that is that I do seek out alternate perspectives for sure. And some of the allure of Edge in the late 90s and early 00s was reading a review of GTA that accidentally gave it 6 out of 10 or whatever, and it was meant to be 8, and reading what they said, or Final Fantasy X getting a 6, just back when Edge used to give out a lot of those kinds of scores. I've always valued those alternate perspectives.
I'm not above also being like, why the fuck did this outlet give this a 6 out of 10, when it's clearly one of the best games of the year, and then complaining about it to Matthew in WhatsApp, because that happens too. I would say seeking out alternate perspectives, definitely. I like to read what people think about games I don't play or don't necessarily, I'm not as interested in, but they care about and Mike Robinson is a good example, Matthew.
What about the second part of the question about fictional characters?
The only one I could think of, and this is really niche, so apologies if no one's actually seen this. There used to be this American sitcom called News Radio. It had Phil Hartman on and Dave Foley and Maura Tierney.
Is that her? Yeah, that's right. Anyway, it also had the incredibly irritating American comedian Andy Dick on it, as a guy called Matthew, who was just absolutely hopeless.
He was the physical comedy character, which I don't think all sitcoms necessarily have or need, but he was just always falling over chairs and you were like, how does this guy get in a newsroom? He was like a completely unbelievable creation, but it stood out because he was very specifically a Matthew, not on that. And I kind of like to be called Matthew as well.
So it kind of always grated like, the only other pop culture Matthew is this fucking goon. Like a proper, what's the thing with Homer Simpson? Oh well, it's Homer Simpson, isn't it?
The idiot cop.
Police cops.
Yes.
Yeah, when they re-tool it after the pilot.
Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, I was trying to think of other Matthews. There was, I can't remember how I felt about him, but in Friday Night Lights, there was Matt Saracen, who was like the, like the lean, was he the quarterback guy?
Quite soft guy?
Yeah, the handsome guy who's not the most charismatic, but like the sort of hot shot. Yeah. Yeah.
I think he was all right.
He was fine. Yeah. Yeah.
But he's a Matt, not a Matthew.
Yeah. I mean, I struggled with Samuels, to be honest. Indeed, all I could find was a character.
Oh, actually, I've got one for best. And then there was a suggestion for Samuel the sheep from Charlotte's Web, which I believe is a talking sheep. Not ideal.
So the best one I managed to find was the Tommy Lee Jones character in The Fugitive, Marshall Samuel Gerrard. Definitely best. Oh, that is good.
All-timer, sort of 90s movie character. So that felt spot on.
What about Sam Malone from Cheers?
Yeah, I mean, that's definitely up there as well. I'm agnostic on Samwell Tarly and Samwise Gamgee, the sort of like fat sidekick characters.
Oh, the fat idiot Sams.
Exactly, not ideal. I wish them well, but definitely not my favourite. But the worst, I could only get a Sam for the worst.
And I thought that prick who Shia LaBeouf played in Transformers, Sam Witwicky, just always thought he was a shi- I mean, I hated that first Transformers film, but the whole Shia LaBeouf thing, I feel like was weaponised annoyance for me when I was 18. I just thought, fuck this guy, he's called Sam.
Sam Witwicky from Transformers. Such a weird cut.
Yeah, very precise. We got through that one, Matthew. So do you want to read this next one?
While you both have an objective critical eye, you both have very distinctive tastes in games. If you were invited to make a game together, what genre and setting would you do as a design duo? If you can elaborate more than that, cool.
But I realise it's a big ask. Thanks for the great podcast. That's from Biggy Im.
I thought we should figure this out live, Matthew.
Yeah, I haven't prepped for this.
Yeah, and I agree with the point about we have very distinctive tastes in games. That's what makes it a great podcast, baby. Okay, so, I don't know, I feel like I always try and meet Matthew halfway on his interest.
So, if we want to go with the detective game, Matthew, I'm good with that. What do you think?
I would like that. I feel like a game which lets us write between us would be good. If we have any strength, which is useful to video game production, it's probably being okay with words.
So, a detective game.
I can manage the odd spreadsheet? Can do that?
Yeah, I don't think there should be any spreadsheets in this game.
No, I agree with that. I meant more for the actual creation of the game, but...
Okay, rather than the end of the game.
No, I'm not suggesting we make a football manager. You know, that's not us. Yeah, I agree with that.
It's funny because I was thinking about this and I thought, what are some games that are like close to something I would come up with? And I came up with two, right? I thought LA.
Noire was definitely one, because it's full of like Mad Men actors and it's got loads of like story stuff in it, but also a bit of like GTA DNA as well. And the other one was Fury.
But you can't come up with that because it already exists.
No, no, but I'm saying like what's close to something that like...
Oh, what's close to Symbiote, right. So I think you're claiming you imagined this game.
No, it's more like where they've kind of got...
I've just imagined this game called LA. Noire. It's like, no, you haven't.
I haven't like, I'm not having a psychotic break. And the other one was Fury, which is a flip side of this. So I was going to say if it's not a detective game, I'd probably pitch fast paced action with some thumping electric music in the background.
However, I think detective is more our speed, Matthew. But I was wondering what you thought about like an LA. Noir-ish kind of thing, where there is a bit of an open world element to it, as well as the actual detecting and writing.
But what do you think?
Yeah, I'd be all right with that. I mean, the thing with detective games is I often just want to get to the meat of the detecting. So the idea of driving to a place isn't particularly interesting.
I want to be at the place and I want to see that chalk outline, and I want to see a beer bottle covered in blood and some cigarettes, dog ends and that kind of stuff like that. Then we're cooking the drive over there. Because also, I mean, I guess, because in LA Noire, you often were partnered up with people.
I could see us just writing two characters who are quite like us, and I don't know if our car banter would be just quite played out from having done 200 plus episodes of podcasts and we just sit there in awkward silence.
I mean, I think it would probably end up being quite a lot like the first 30 minutes of episode 200, to be honest. Just a lot of that and then me chastising you for being too readily, and you complaining about that in the pub later on. I think it would work quite well.
I mean, imagine we do the thing where we're like, oh shit, we're going past Intermezzo, pull over and we get a sandwich on the way to the crime scene. That's gold. That's pure gold.
That is. Oh god, like a perfect world we're in Intermezzo. It's just open forever.
We'll use that LA. Noire camera rig to scan Tony.
Exactly. We'll scan in all of the various bar sandwich people.
All the sandwiches themselves. That will be an incredible day in the studio where we buy all the sandwiches we want to include in the game and get to scan them with those cameras and then eat them.
Getting the Macoco Egg Mayo one re-scanned because I'm not happy with how the eggs rendered. Just sort of like that kind of level of specificity. The reason I mention Alienware, the reason I like the driving over bits is because it's a period piece and so you're absorbing the world before you get to the crime that is set within that world.
I'm not saying, if it is a bath open world game, which I think we talked about before anyway on the podcast, it's not a very interesting drive.
The other downside is you don't drive and I really try to avoid driving if I can. So I guess Catherine's driving us.
I mean, that's even funny. I'm in the back.
We're both in the back like the Lincoln Lawyer.
Like the Lincoln Lawyer except covered in egg mayo.
Do you know what it feels like a game? There are two games where I feel like these are the sort of things you would create if given the sort of charts. I mean, Ace Attorney aside, but like Dark Side Detective feels like something you would create, and so does the Golden Idol Games as well.
Definitely feel within, because they are pure meat of the mystery. No fluff, right?
That's true. I also feel like our love of action and big bosses. I do think at the end of the cases, once you finally cracked it, you have like a fight with the person.
Just like a boss fight in the courtroom or something. It's just exciting. You know, because Alice Attorney has those health bars for the cases as you're going through.
So that's why you're encouraged to really nail all your observations, because otherwise you enter the fight with a very compromised health bar.
I like that. I also like the idea of like, you know how in Elinor Collefelps' hat knock falls off when he gets punched too much? Our glasses could each fall off.
You know what I mean? It's like, it's like, ah, and they both kind of like, they kind of tumble off sort of thing. And then if you plug in a second controller, you can play as the other giant man.
So play as me or Matthew and you, it's like two people versus one. Otherwise, you've got like a shit AI companion, Matthew or Samuel. I think that works quite well.
Now I'm picturing it like more like a Streets of Rage rather than like a complicated 3D platinum action game. I'm seeing it more 2D on. We're just going in and out of the foreground.
As big as fucking Mehager or whatever his name is, but no way near as like muscle-y.
Yeah, but I also like the idea that it looks like the Golden Idol game side on until it turns into a side scrolling beat-em-up. So it's like I've solved the mystery and then you start getting that parallax scrolling and like as we kind of move forward and start beating the guy up, I think that's gold again, gold.
If any developers are listening.
Okay, so I think we have given you what you wanted, big yim. I wish you well. Okay, next question is from Gwin-Turnal Affairs.
Any particular games that got you through or you associate with worst times in your life? Jolly one. EG.
I was playing Red Dead 2 when I got the call my brother had died. In shock, I continued to wander around saying hello to random NPCs for a bit. Haven't played it since.
Similarly, playing Dishonored 2 in High Chaos mode was extremely therapeutic during a recent breakup. Nice mood lifting question for you lads. Well, I hope that your ex wasn't eaten by rats that you summoned magically.
That's all I'll say on the Dishonored 2 one. I've got a few answers to this. I don't want to bum people out too much, Matthew.
So I've got a couple of answers to this. What about you?
Definitely when I was made redundant from RPS, I have a fondness for the games that I played in the couple of months at the end of 2020 where I was just really bummed out. I maybe reviewed some things and overscored them because I was just in a weird sort of headspace with them. I'm not going to name what they are, just in case the commissioners are listening and feel annoyed that I did that.
But going back, I think when I was a kid or young teenager, in the aftermath of family upheaval, parents divorce and whatnot, I definitely think getting big into pointing click games in the mid-90s had something to do, or not directly to do with it, but was was a bit of a sort of barm, because they were things to sit at the computer and think about for hours. And I don't know if other people play pointing click games like this, but like all throughout the day, I'd be thinking about the night before's obstacle or problem that I couldn't overcome. And I'm thinking about like all the items I had and where I could go and what I could try when I got home.
So that's quite a good all encompassing genre to lose yourself in when you want to distract yourself from stuff that makes you less happy, which I definitely did at times. But yeah, that's probably it for me. You know, like Disco World 2, a good antidote to bleak times.
Yeah, I understand that. The example that came to mind for me was, I actually hadn't really thought about this for a long time, but on the day of a very significant funeral when I was about 10 or 11, that was the first time I ever played Shadow of the Empire. So I always wondered if my, some might say outsized affection for that game, is maybe tied to that because that was definitely a like, oh my god, this exciting Star Wars stuff is such a great distraction from how sad this, how devastating this is.
So there's maybe a bit that I just playing the asteroid belt sequence and the Hoth sequences and that, and just being like, wow, this is incredible. Which is of course as good as the game ever really gets, but yeah, I do have a lot of affection for that game. Yeah, Layoffs is a funny one because I remember after the, when I took Voluntary Redundancy at the end of 2023, Spider-Man 2 paid the price for that.
That's a game that I just didn't love. I mean, the parry is to blame for it partly. Why is Spider-Man parrying?
He already had a counterattack. That's such a good, that's the question that undoes that game.
Ironically, I've yet to find a vocal parry to argue against this point.
What you need to do is tap a button that makes no sense in the context of the rest of that control scheme, Matthew, and then you'll perfectly counter my parry criticism. That will work out for you, I think. Yeah, I think that game paid the price a little bit.
I think I probably would like it a bit more if I hadn't played it around that. It was quite a difficult choice, you know, of like, are you going to fight for your job or move on? It's just, it's not, those are not good times.
And I know people now have been through two or three rounds of layoffs the last few years, and human brains frankly aren't built for that, to be honest. That's tough. I thought about the pandemic a bit with this as well, Matthew, because obviously everyone played a lot of games during the pandemic.
And some games just lost to the pandemic now. It's funny because recently I started playing Sea of Thieves again with my friend Lynch, who lives in Japan. And we play it for a couple of hours in the morning.
He catches me up on all of the stuff he's been doing and I catch him up on the stuff I've been doing. But I realized in my head that it's so firmly tied to the pandemic, and I liked that game because it was a hangout space for a solid year there. It was like Thursday evening, I'd play with a bunch of friends and I'd drink like a bottle of red wine, and that was like socializing for the week.
And it just felt a little bit bleak after a while. And so now I still associate being on those ship and playing those jaunty tunes with how sad that was in 2020. Yeah, so that's tough.
But every now and then there's a game that I have a slightly happier association with the pandemic. Ghost of Tsushima and Yakuza Zero, Deus Ex. I played all those games in 2021, 2020.
And those were really nice bits of escapism from the lockdown. So yeah, some good examples there in an otherwise bummer question, but quite a good question. So yes.
Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
Hi, Samuel and Matthew. What would your top 10 list of correspondingly numbered games be? I.e.
1, Halo, 2, Guitar Hero 2, 3, Super Mario Brothers 3, etc. For the sake of argument, the games chosen can have equal standing in the list regardless of their numerical position. So basically this was an exercise in can you think of a good game from 1 to 10 with the number 1 to 10 in the title?
Yeah, it gets, it gets tricky once you get into the end of the list really. Yeah, I don't, I didn't actually prepare for this one, Matthew.
Well, I can run my list past you and see if you think it holds up. Go for it. Yeah, so I will say there's a couple where my work around was that the number did appear in the Japanese title.
Okay, fair enough.
But they have slightly different names over here. So for number 1, it doesn't have to have a number in it, right? Because no games have one in it.
So 1. Super Mario Galaxy. 2.
Uncharted 2.
Good.
Xenoblade Chronicles 3. 4. Resident Evil 4.
Perfect.
Gears 5.
Perfect.
6. Ace Attorney Spirit of Justice, aka Gyakuten Saiban 6.
Nice.
7. Yakuza Like a Dragon, aka Yakuza 7 in Japan.
Nice.
8. Mario Kart 8.
9.
Dragon Quest 9. 10. Final Fantasy 10.
That's great. I don't think I could really top that, to be honest anyway.
Those are the answers.
Basically, that's it. It just comes down to, can you think of enough without repeating yourself in a series?
You can do a run of like, 6 to 10 could all be Final Fantasy if you wanted.
Yeah, that's it. I mean, it's again though, most of, most, unless you do like, FIFA 06, which just seems ridiculous.
What's looking a bit like that?
I think, yeah, like you say, those are the answers. There's no need for a second list really. But the first five are sort of like, you can sort of move around as you see fit, you know, but.
It's funny, because when I first read this, I thought, oh, this would be a brilliant draft. But actually when you do it, 6 to 10 is such a slog.
Yeah.
That I just don't think they'd be, it wouldn't be fun at all.
No, that's the thing. It would be, I know Joe wanted us to do more high concept drafts, so I don't think that's quite the one. Those are good picks.
The only other one I thought, I thought you might have gone Resi 6 for 6, because that would have been quite funny.
Yeah. I set myself the extra challenge of not doubling up any series, you see.
Yeah. And if you're picking 6 but not 4 is.
I did have Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 in there, and then I remembered Resident Evil 4 existed.
Well, okay. Well, those were the answers. There was no need for the draft.
I hope you enjoyed that.
Yeah. The podcast now moves on. If you had to have one game console kiosk or arcade cabinet in your house, which one would you have?
To make it harder, the cabinet or kiosk only has one playable game. That's from Koig. I don't want one in my house, Matthew.
First of all, I'll say.
Why? Is that a space issue? Yeah.
But I mean, I live in like a one-bedroom flat. It's not ideal.
You'd never be able to go to sleep because your face would be illuminated by the screen, and it would keep shouting crazy taxi throughout the night, and you'd be like, shut the fuck up.
Yeah, that's true. It's not ideal. And you could turn it off.
I think you should have an extra rule, and it's on forever, as always. You cannot turn it off.
Yeah, it increases your energy bills by about 120 pounds a month, basically. It's... Yeah, I thought the answer...
I thought N64 with Mario 64 on it would do for this. I just think that would be the defining game for that console and a console I like. Obviously, the rule is with N64 pads, they're all completely fucked, so I wouldn't be able to control Mario properly because the analog stick is fucked.
But otherwise, all good, Matthew.
But it would just be stuck on the rubber face intro screen with like the gloved hand is just always permanently in the bottom right corner because of stick drift.
Yeah, that's funny. So that was my answer, but I will reiterate, I never want this to happen.
I said pick Ghost Squad. Oh, just thought it would be a fun arcade cabinet to have. But again, I don't particularly want to.
I'd rather have a pinball machine, if to be honest, than a games arcade machine, as we've established in this podcast. So I don't necessarily have that deep relationship with arcade cabinets.
Yeah, that's true. Actually, I had actually just, because Koig included a picture of a dream cast in someone's house with a point of sale display.
Oh, you were right. I see. I think you did say arcade cabinet.
No, he did. You are right. And yeah, in that case, pinball would be great, wouldn't it?
I mean, replacing the parts would be annoying, but obviously, next gen Star Trek, next generation pinball, that would be good. If not that, are the two Indiana Jones ones? They're both pretty good, aren't they?
There's a Kingdom of the Crystal Skull one. I think it's got a bunch of different stuff in it. I played that one a few years ago.
That was really cool. Yeah, yeah. But Ghost was a great shout, Matthew.
Always a good time. If not that, it would be the Star Wars Trilogy Arcade, the 90s one, which I found out about in this podcast before. So good.
I think we answered that one. But again, it has to be on all the time being allowed in your house. And you have to put money into it.
It's even worse. You can't ever get the money out of the machine.
Whoever has changed. No one.
Yeah, it's true. Not since the pandemic. No.
Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
If there was a real Mario Party up against labor and Lib Dems and the other shower, what would its manifesto be and would you vote for it? That's from Balladeer.
I gave this question the time I felt was put into it, which was about 10 seconds. The same level of thought went into it. I just thought, if it's like Mario Party specifically, I thought that I like the idea that the manifesto could only include noises that Mario and other characters make in the game.
So just woo-hoo and all that stuff. Health Secretary Toad's main policy would just be going, wah-wah, like that. And then the entire economy is decided by moving around a board and landing on bullshit tiles with coins on them.
Done. That's me, Matthew.
Basically came to the same conclusion. I said, assuming it's based on the real Mario Party, it all hinges on randomly redistributed wealth, which is a horrible policy. Of course, you wouldn't vote for it because Mario Party is shit.
So yeah, if you want to talk about reviews that we disagree with last year, when everyone was giving that Mario Party game, like not liking Mario Party, not popular take.
I've voiced it quite loudly on Twitter. I didn't like it. And I'd always say no, it was some peers of my respect, explained to me in very measured ways about why they did like Mario Party.
And so I had to sort of begrudgingly go, ah yes, I can see why you would have enjoyed that and had good fun with that, while inside secretly thinking, it's total dogshit, I hate this dogshit, this is dogshit for idiots.
If the argument is dot dot dot, I have children and isn't that magical, then it's a no dog, that's not a valid opinion, it's not a valid take. I'm glad that happened to you.
I had loads of people explaining in great detail why the pure chaos of it was what they loved, and the culture that had built around it in their head from years of playing these games. And it's like, I feel like you're doing a lot of heavy lifting for a pretty shit game that Nintendo didn't put very much thought into, I don't think. And that you managed to make it work for you, I really, this is the ultimate I wish you well.
The thing is, I could at least go along with the idea of liking individual minigames because some of them are good. But if you're talking about the core experience of going around that board, surely no one can say, that's good, surely not.
Yeah, I mean, this is it. Because I went in with that, I was like, oh, I get it, you like the minigames right. And they were like, no, it's the board game and here's why.
I was like, I cannot believe this is happening. Like I'm being punked.
Get me off this fucking train now. All right, next question then. Enjoyed Matthew taking a swipe there at some randos on social media.
They weren't randos. I don't think this is the podcast, but if they do, I do respect you.
Yeah, I wish you well in the non-offensive sense. Okay, so I really loved the last episode with Caspian. Again, this was a while ago.
This was the episode with Caspian we did last year. It was Back Page Pod kind of instilled. Don't know what that means.
Oh, distilled that probably means. But that's fine. I'm not judging you.
Do you ever think about doing something mad that goes against your fan base? Well, first of all, I'll say the Nintendo Top 50 last year. I mean, you know, there were complaints that we did three episodes around that.
So that covers the month straight away. There's another part of this question, though. Speaking of, you're on a long train journey.
What's your game plan?
What a shift.
Do you consult secret train drinking? Do you set aside a long gaming session? Do you raw dog it with podcasts?
What's your plan for the greatest mode of transport? Reg McFly asked that one, Matthew.
Raw dogging if you listen to podcasts.
No, you're meant to do nothing. That's the thing, a stare into space.
Podcast is a great thing. That's what I do do on trains. I love a podcast.
Yeah, same.
I feel super engaged.
The first bit, I do occasionally threaten more top 50s occasionally, but that's about it. I do try and think of ideas to properly get the blood pumping so people don't get bored. I wouldn't try and piss anyone off deliberately.
The closest I come to that is maybe making slightly more provocative picks and certain things like list episodes, Matthew, like putting Spider-Man 2 at number one for the 2004 pod and above Half-Life 2, which is clearly bullshit, but it's entertaining.
Yeah. I don't know if it is bullshit. Yeah.
I don't think I'd do anything mad, really. I can't really picture what that would be, that lacking in imagination.
If we did like a here's why Sega games are shit kind of thing, but why would we do that? We can just complain about people who bang on about Sega games around the side. That's more our energy.
Like mad would be we did a three month arc where like every episode we just did a retrospective on a FIFA game or something. That would be mad, but we'd never do that.
No, because it would just be depressing. As for the other part of the question, I agree with Matthew. Until when Bellatoro got put on phones, actually, that's been the exception.
I did watch all of Atlanta on Disney Plus on my phone, going to and from the office for Bethesda last year. But after that, it's mostly podcasting. I don't train drink.
I find it a bit bleak. It's because I used to do long distance journeys for an old ex from Worcester to Bath, and back again on weekends. I just fucking hated it.
I always drank three for five pounds tiny pink wines I got from the Tesco Express near Worcester, Four Gate Street Station. That's a depressing year for your boy. Usually it's one podcast to carry with it, Matthew.
What about you?
Not a train drinker, unless it's delicious Pepsi Max cherry. Music podcasts, more of a book reader than a game player. I think I've played things on my Switch when I've had, like I'm doing reviews and I'm just like chipping away at something, but when games machines are portable, I don't play them out and about.
I play them around my house in rooms that aren't the living room. That's the portability I like, is being able to sit on my bed and play games. I don't necessarily want to sit on a park bench and play fucking Tomodachi Life.
Yeah, same here. Also, you got to admit that even with something like the Switch, they're a bit less portable than they used to be, all of these sort of deck shaped games consoles. We got broad-shouldered man as well.
You take up a lot of space.
Yeah, also a Steam Deck, it feels too expensive. It feels like someone would nick off me.
Yeah, I agree. I've found a sweet spot with the Steam Deck, which is just playing it in bed, basically. It's how I played Half-Life 2 and the expansions, actually, is in bed on the Steam Deck.
So, yeah, otherwise, I'm kind of the same. So, yeah. OK.
Well, on that wet fart of a note, let's move on to the next question, Matthew.
I suppose you like doing it on trains. I don't know. Like, not all of it can be gold.
Not every fucking second of our lives are entertaining. I haven't got a funny train take.
Let the record show that I regret including the question in the episode plan. Next question, Matthew.
When I was a teen, racing games were a common sight in my collection, whether it was Metropolis Street Racer, Project Gotham, Burnout or even F-Zero GX. There was always at least one racing game I owned for any given console, but now it's been well over a decade since I've actually played one. I think part of this is that racing games were often the best visual showcase for a new console.
Whilst today, lots of other genres fill that space and I spent less time in multiplayer, which was a big part of how I played racing games with friends. Are there any game series or genres that used to be a big part of your gaming diet, but you've since left behind? That's from Synthetic Man.
I had a couple of answers to this. I don't really play RTS games as much these days. That used to be a primary genre for me as a young man.
Is that because the genre doesn't exist as much?
Yeah, there is a bit of that, but I don't really have the curiosity for the ones that do come along. There's one that's been worked on by some ex-Blizzard people that got showed at a couple of PC Gamer things. I don't know what happened to it, actually, but that was hyped up for a while.
I didn't really fancy it in the end.
Some things that looked a bit Halo Wars-y was quite quick.
Yeah, I'm quite curious about a game called Tempest Rising, which is coming out in April, and that's very much riffing on Command and Conquer in my wheelhouse. I played a bit of Ashes of the Singularity a few years ago. That was quite enjoyable.
Obviously, the Dawn of Wars, but those are older games now. Yeah, I don't play as many of those. The other genre I thought of for this, Matthew, was things like, in the early days of PC Gamer, I did used to play a lot more survival games actually.
I had a proper go at The Long Dark and DayZ and Don't Starve. I played all of those, a little bit of Subnautica as well. But the loop-based gameplay of those meant I burned out on them a little bit.
Then No Man's Sky was the last one I played and bounced off. Anything now that's like the primary game mechanic is go and mine this thing off of this other thing and collect hundreds of this thing. If you die, you have to start again.
I just don't bother with those games anymore. Those come to mind for me. But what about you?
I'd say similar to you with RTS, but with point-and-click games. The genre doesn't exist in quite the same way that it did. It's definitely well represented in the space.
I know there are people like WodgieEye making great point-and-click games. I'm very up for their, what's it called? Not Dark Skies.
They've got a time travel one coming out soon. That I think looks really good. Very interested in that.
But more like how the point-and-click genre became the interactive story, interactive adventure game, the kind of tell-tale, life is strange, whatever. It feels like those games fill that space a little bit now. And I'm not particularly interested in, in just kind of clicking through those kind of low peril, low puzzle environments.
They don't really do it for me. There was actually a period I was briefly really into online shooters, multiplayer, you know, just because there was a good culture of it, a future, you know, back when Modern Warfare first arrived, with Battlefield Bad Company 2, the kind of games in that sort of three to four year window, like it felt like I was playing most evenings with friends and I don't know if it's the Battle Royale thing, like didn't quite fit us or we've all just gone off and led quite different lives and so we don't meet up and play these things anymore, but online multiplayer is just not a part of my life at all now, where it used to be. I have a good chunk of time every week, so yeah, I'm kind of a bit sad about that.
I booted up Call of Duty just to see if it, not if it had the juice, but if it specifically had the juice for me. And it was just so obnoxious, the kind of framing of it and it's kind of housed in this app of its own and it's full of all this baffling stuff. It made me feel a million years old.
I just couldn't pass what I was looking at. And then I played like one game and got teabagged by like fucking Paul Atreides and he had a shotgun that was like neon pink and it was like, this is just, it's just like fucking kill me now and get me out of this place.
Do you feel like Cutty in The Wire when he tries to get back into drug dealing, but then like he meets that Marlowe guy who belittles him for being old and a bit of shit and then he just has to like not do it anymore. Did you feel like that, Matthew?
I really felt like a grandad had stumbled into Ready Player One. Everywhere I looked, there was a pop culture person like dabbing. There's like fucking Dave Batista over there, some fucking wrestler over here, Paul Atreides, his Ghost Rider, here's some rappers, I don't know, Snoop Dogg's here for some reason.
That stuff is just hell on earth for me. Just so loud. It's like being at fair ground and all the machines are playing the music too loud and you're just like freaking out a bit.
Really very, very bad times.
That's funny. Can I ask you a question related to the racing game bit of this question, Matthew? So here's something right.
Because I feel like in principle when it was announced that the Playground Games would be doing Fable, everyone was like, oh, I think I want to just play them the Forza Horizon 4. We're like, oh yeah, British Studio, they get this. They'll do a good job with this.
And then I feel like Forza Horizon is the most successful modern racing series. And it's gone on hold, so Fable can be... I mean, it seems quite obvious that's what's happened, right?
Because another one would have been out by now. And there's no, as far as we know, there's not a further one coming out this year. They're getting that Fable game done.
Is it worth not having Forza Horizon for a bit in order to get them to make Fable? Or would you have taken another Forza Horizon and given Fable to a different studio? Now I'm asking you questions.
I think they are a good fit for Fable. Not necessarily because of the Britishness of it. What I really liked about Forza Horizon, what I still like about it, is that I truly think it is the closest thing there is to a racing game for everyone.
I think it's incredibly accessible. I think it's structured and smoothed out in a way that anyone can pick that up and get some quite spectacular fun quite fast. And the thing that excites me about Fable is the idea of them applying that process and that know-how to the RPG.
I'd love to see what a faster moving, more agreeable RPG that isn't wrapped up in the traditions of like Elder Scrolls or whatever, or Mass Effect or the few biggies that seem to define everything. I'm committed to being excited about Fable now and have been for like whatever it is, six years.
You're in too deep.
Yeah, definitely. I mean, I am kind of surprised because I was under the impression that there were like a Forza Horizon team and a Fable team, and it feels like quite a long time without a Forza Horizon, given that they turn those things around like pretty quickly, like two, three years. And that is a shame because it is amazing and I would happily take one of those.
But I wouldn't want to say like kill or Fable to get Forza Horizon back. I'm sure like when they do make another Forza Horizon, they know how to make those brilliant and it just will be brilliant. So that's fine.
I'm okay with that.
The last one was four years ago, right? It was five?
Yeah, it was like it was a launch game.
I think it's just inevitable with the size of games now that it's going to just pull in more people to get it made.
A lot of them left the Forza Horizon team to set up Maverick, didn't they?
Yeah, was there another studio called Lighthouse or something with a bunch more of them?
Yeah, I mean, this is what happens. They all left another successful racing team a long time ago to make Playground. It's the circle of life.
Yeah, I mean, I agree. I want to see that fable game come to fruition. But yeah, it's just interesting because it is the king of these games and it was the most dependably released series, really.
They did well and people loved them and yeah, and they're about to launch five on PS5. So all these years later, it's still popular enough to justify that. So yeah, I just wanted to ask that, Matthew.
OK, cool. I'll read this next one from Zack. Have you ever bumped into someone you've given a bit of a shit review to?
How'd that go? Or vice versa for Samuel? Matthew, what have you got for this one?
I actually haven't. I mean, largely from reviewing Nintendo games, like I just didn't get to meet anyone from Nintendo or anyone important enough. I doubt they ever read the reviews.
I was told that they liked and were appreciative of the Skyward Sword X back in the day. So whether they'd actually read it, I saw Enuma holding a copy of it, of that Edge at the Zelda concert. And I was like, amazing.
That's got my fulsome praise for the game in there. Not everyone else is going to like it. That's what I wish I could tell them.
The one I have heard about is, I've had friends on Edge magazine say they've had an earful from David Cage over the years because he really hated a review I wrote and because it's anonymous, he just tells off anyone who comes to him from Edge.
He must have dropped that by now, surely.
Oh yeah, but no, this was back in the day, like Richard Martin were back on the mag and occasionally they'd say like, oh, I saw David Cage at Gamescom and he fucking chewed me out about Heavy Rain again. And I think his line was, you reviewed me and not my game, that he kept saying, that's what he was absolutely obsessed on. It's like, it got your name all over it.
Like you have to take ownership and responsibility for what you've done.
Oh, that's funny. That's a good example. I can't, I don't have anything that good really, but I will say as a PR, there was a very negative review of a game I worked on, where a journalist started it by telling an anecdote about a conversation he had with me at Gamescom one year.
He didn't say what my name was, but he was using it as a stick to beat the game with, which was a bit of a bummer. But when you're a PR, you just pretend it didn't happen and get on with it. I'm not really big into holding grudges on behalf of companies, because I have actually met PRs who have done that.
I'm like, well, surely your relationship with me is more valuable than, your relationship with me transcends the companies you work for. It's a small industry, and that's how I think I don't, who cares, move on. The other way around, I can't think of a time that I was probably, I don't know why I did this, but I had an email Q&A for Enslaved Odyssey to the West with Tameem from that studio.
And in it, I said, I gave heavily sold 71% for Play Magazine, and then asked a question off the back of that. And if I read that as him, I would have thought, this guy's a dickhead. He politely laughed it off in the answer.
But, in retrospect, I was 20, and that wasn't really a fair thing to put in there. So, that's not really a meter. I mean, I've met Tameem since I went for lunch with him before Hellblade came out, and very, very nice.
But like, yeah, that was one time where I was like, oh, why did I do that, you know? But I was a hothead asshole on an Xbox magazine. What can you do?
So, yes. Okay, you'll read this next one, Matthew?
I once ordered a pizza at my brother's house after an evening's worth of drinking. I went for a BBQ chicken pizza with BBQ sauce base. When the pizza arrived and I began to tuck in, I noticed an odd flavour to the pizza.
It wasn't disgusting, just very odd and very familiar. I was hungry and it didn't put me off and I was determined to work out what the taste was. It was on the last slice when it hit me.
It wasn't BBQ sauce they'd used for the base, it was HP sauce. What is the most cursed pizza topping you've ever had? That's from Doomegan.
This is a Video Games Podcast, I'll remind you.
Yeah. I think I try to limit this now to one or two novelty questions. I regret including this one.
Let me just say that straight away. Pineapple and ham in combo is still the one for this, because after I ate a Hawaiian pizza for the first time, I vomited everywhere. That in my head is very cursed.
Almost anything else works for me, sausage, different cheeses, etc. Matthew, what about you?
I won't tell the very long version of it, because it's too rambling for mailbag. But when I was younger, a couple of times, I had these hallucinations at night. I can't really explain what they are, like waking dreams or things that I saw that I was absolutely convinced were real, to the point where I woke other people up to deal with them.
So the famous one that my family always make fun of me is that I thought there was a robotic spider in my room, and I had to go and wake up my mum and stepdad, because I was like, you've got to come and deal with this robotic spider. Similar thing happened when I was staying with my friend Cyrus in London. I was absolutely convinced that A, there was a fox in the room and B, that I trapped the fox under a duvet.
How this relates to pizza is that what I think triggers it, is an ingredient on the Pizza Express, Il Padrino pizza.
Well, this might have come up before, actually, on the podcast.
Well, yeah, I only ever had these things happen when I had that specific pizza. I don't think they even do it anymore. I think it's maybe Aubergine, but the only time I ever eat Aubergine was on this specific pizza.
Maybe it was a specific brand of Aubergine they've had. But as cursed pizza toppings go, the thing that triggered these animal visions, like I'd say that's it. So yeah, Aubergine.
That's a long way of saying Aubergine.
Wow. I mean, if Matthew wants to see through time and space, he just has to eat an Aubergine, basically.
What's that stuff that business executives go and take and sort of like a teepee somewhere? They're going to huff that stuff and then they think they see the future. It's like some kind of Native American spice mix or mushrooms or something.
Or like that episode of Industry that I just watched in season 3.
Yeah. There's an episode of Billions where they do it. For me, it would just be like sticking in a tent and feed him an aubergine.
Good stuff. Okay. That's enough on that one.
Thank you for the question. Side note, Matthew. I've been getting quite into brown sauce recently for the first time.
I said this to a friend while I was wearing glasses and she turned to me and went, are you turning into an elderly man? Is that it? In your late 30s now, you're getting into brown sauce.
She was a bit, I think she was actually disappointed at me.
I'd say it's not the getting into it, it's the voicing it as an anecdote. That's probably, that's the old man energy. You can like what you like at whatever age, but when you just start announcing that you're getting into new condiments.
Yeah, it's making this podcast has done it. I feel the need to provide commentary on everything that's going on. It's all content, baby.
That's what's happened to me. Basically, my brain is completely fucked from five years of doing this. Okay, next question.
He might have a pass for plundering by bashing the fash, but is the casual consumption of whole lemons and durian during his latest lark enough to indict Indiana Jones? That's from Bjorn. Let me just say this, right?
This is why the Dems lost the election, because we got too focused on what the left were doing and not what the right were doing. Okay? Indiana Jones has done a lot to bring down fascism.
Okay? Show a bit of bloody respect. What do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, I'm in complete agreement. I absolutely love the trend this is referencing. Trend, the habit, I guess, in the New Indiana Jones game where he just eats fruits and biscuits and cakes and breads just whole.
He just gobbles them down like four unskinned bananas in a row, which is just insane behavior. But yeah, I mean, I love that. I thought that gave it a lot of charm.
Like finally, in the kind of Venn diagram of me and Indiana Jones, the one pixel of crossover is the way we both fucking scarf down a biscotti.
Yeah, not even dipping it first, just like...
Shove it in, I don't even know what it is. I'm just like, yeah, eat that. There were all these achievements in the game for eating different fruits and biscuits at different places in the world.
They were obviously really big on that element of the game.
It does give it a lot of character, I think.
We'll have to work that into our game as well. I guess that's what they get.
Yeah, exactly. That's why we make Catherine pull over and go into a sandwich shop.
To buy us a Hint Sausage Roll.
When you and I have just got... just kicked the shit out of a murder suspect, we're taking a lot of damage ourselves. We're just sort of like...
I just like, in first person, get a pasty and just mash it into my face. You never... It just disappears for the player, but for me, it's just gone into my face, basically, so...
Yeah, I've just got a hotbar along the bottom. It's just ten scotch eggs.
Oh, amazing. All right, God. Next question, then.
Hitman's obviously great and a very singular experience, even compared to previous Hitman games. Apart from the IO Interactive James Bond thing, is there any other kind of game you'd like to see get the systemic sandbox treatment? No idea how to actually phrase this, but hopefully you know what I mean.
Nige. Sam, do you know what Nige means?
I think it basically means the same kind of like clockwork, not quite open worlds, lots of things happening at different times.
Yeah, I guess take a game but turn it into that. I really struggle to come up with one, so I'm hoping you've got an answer.
Well, I thought this is something that Metal Gear could dabble with if they bring that series back. The idea of, only because the closest I ever really got was that Chapter 3 in Metal Gear Solid 4 when you're going through Prague, and you get a little bit of like, I think he's maybe in the station at first and then there's maybe a few civilians around, but not much. It's an oft-criticized part of that game, but it's quite interesting what it alludes to.
I think the idea of if you start a Metal Gear Solid game, and it is that, it's Snake or someone maybe, and the goal is to execute someone in a public space, but you have all these different ways you can do it. That's maybe something. I do struggle with this, though.
Otherwise, I came up with, I thought this would make for a great, high-concept GTA 6 mission or two, but maybe you're in, maybe it's like an event, like a festival or like a parade or something like that, and then it's about, there's maybe like four to five ways it could play out if you replay it later on, you know? In general, actually, that's something I keep thinking about with GTA is something I wonder if will be there like maybe a bit more of an innovation of this game, where it's a tiny bit more open-ended in the missions, just because that's probably where it's the most risk of feeling stale versus five. But, you know, there's maybe even a tiny, there's arguably a tiny little bit of this in Red Dead Redemption 2 already, because you're often completing missions where there's a chaotic sandbox that can do things to affect the outcome.
But yeah, otherwise I struggled, Matthew. Anything more to add?
Uh, no, that you had those worth all better ideas than I came up with. Sorry, Nige.
Sorry, Nige. Let's move on then. Matthew, are you getting commission from any Japanese crime writers yet?
And if you're on the ITV show Dinner Date, what would your three-course meal you would cook for the weirdo coming around for tea be? That's from an improved vegetable tart on the Discord.
No, I'm not getting any commission from any Japanese crime writers. I feel like, I mean, this is on me for not reaching out. I could at least get on to the review circuit for early copies.
Oh, yeah.
Because I feel like this podcast is a reasonably good place to talk about these things, so.
Six thousand people who are interested in things that you like, you know? Yeah.
So why not? I don't know the ITV show Dinner Date. I can summarize what it is from this description.
So, I don't know if you're meant to cook a particular kind of three-course meal.
I didn't do that much research. I just came up with three different meals. So, three different dishes, basically.
Watch your stuff. I'll do my starter and you do your starter.
Okay, go for it.
So, my starter, you're just getting a burrata.
That's a good one.
You just have a whole burrata. I don't have to cook it. I can't cook for shit.
That's the theme of this menu.
Oh, my God. I ate so many burrata during the pandemic, man. So, I ended up putting like two stone on, basically.
Big burrata boy.
I go with a lobster bisque, for starter. My mum has a good recipe for it, so I can't currently do it. But if it's going on the telly, I'd want to at least have a go at it.
Is that soup? I don't know what bisque is, I don't think.
Yeah, it's like a kind of very rich soup, basically. But, yeah, my mum, honestly, it's one of the best things I've ever eaten. It's so good.
My mum's version of this. They're good cooks, my parents, but yeah. Okay, Maine Matthew, what you got?
Well, Maine, I can cook a lasagna.
Nice.
So it would be that.
Good.
And I do the white sauce and everything. It's pretty good. Oh, God.
I know by saying this, Catherine's going to give me so much shit if I never cook it. Do you want the podcast saying you cook a lasagna? That's funny because I've only ever had it three times in my life.
Did she bring up you slagging off maple on the Monster Hunter pod?
I don't know if she's got to that yet. I can hear it getting closer to it.
Keep me updated on how that's going. Okay. Yeah, I just fry a steak.
I would say I'm going to make fresh cut chips and stuff, but to be honest, I'll just go and get a little silver tray of them from M&S, chuck that in the oven.
Oh, nice.
And then I'll make a blue cheese sauce to go with that steak. I do like to. The gout special, that's coming from Samuel Roberts.
How about dessert, Matthew?
It would just be like a premade boxed ice cream of some kind. There are those biscoff ice creams, which are a bit like magnums, but they've got like biscoff in them.
Oh, they're dangerous.
Yeah, I'd just give you one of those. Again, I didn't make it, but it's a thought that counts.
Yeah, you are being basically underdressed to go on to ITV's dinner date. So, yeah, I would just go with an apple crumble. There's no time of year where I don't fancy an apple crumble, except maybe when it's like 34 degrees outside, but that aside, all good.
Oh, okay, Matthew, on to the next question.
Who would be the worst game character to be locked down with? Matt's from Mad Brood.
Okay, I would say any NPC from the Shenmue series, but particularly, and they voiced in English, let me point that out, but particularly Dellen from Shenmue 2, the guy you have to lug crates with at the harbour, who goes, right, left. I've talked about this guy on the podcast before. We've been doing this for four years.
You have to forgive the occasional overlapping reference, but that guy is like, anytime I had to go down to the harbour, that guy is like, I can't believe this bell end is gatekeeping all my best income in this game, because fuck lucky hit, it takes forever. At least this, you can just get done quite quickly. So Dellen is catching some strays there from me, Matthew.
How about you?
It'd be Mr. X from the Resi 2 remake, because it'd just be stomping around after me the whole time. And you know the design of my house. It hasn't got any loops built into it.
So it's like every room is a fucking dead end. So that thing is a nightmare. Like the only loop I've got is the coffee table in the living room.
Yeah. And I just lean over it and smash me and...
It's a very narrow house in some ways.
It is a really narrow house. And it's just very much Mr. X hard mode surviving in my house.
It's a lovely house, but it's just not optimized for the design of Resi 2.
For boss fights.
No, precisely. Yeah, okay, we've answered that one, Matthew. Okay, let's do a couple more then.
There was a time when licensed games were looked down upon, for example, the early MCU games. Hey, early MCU? Probably just means Marvel, right?
Because there are no MCU games. With Indy, Space Marine 2, Spider-Man, hopefully Bond. We seem to be in a golden era.
What do you think a license brings to a game? What does a well-executed license do for you? That's from Gildia 44.
I have an answer to this one. Matthew, should I kick off?
Yeah, go for it.
It asks the question about what does it do for me when it's well-executed. I mean, it's the authenticity thing. It's about how you nail the details.
It's about how you extend a fictional universe, I like, without cheapening it. That's the fundamental appeal, right? It's like, oh yeah, it's the idea of it's a James Bond story, but I get to participate in a game.
I mean, that's the basic appeal of it, right? And then the appeal on top of that is how well do they nail those details? And, what does it bring to a game?
It's obviously recognition. The thing about Space Marine 2, for example, a game I liked from last year, is there's nothing about the game part you couldn't really do with a license like Aliens or indeed Turok, as they're going to do at Saber Interactive. But it's really about all the kind of like amazing audiovisual touches that make it feel like the Warhammer 40,000 universe story.
All that stuff. And so yeah, that really is what it comes down to. And obviously the reason they used to be shit is because the economics of how you made games was different and how you sold games was different and rushing a license game out in a year to make a quick buck was a viable way to make a bunch of cash in the industry.
You can't do it anymore because it's just not, you can't quickly make a shit game and get loads of money for it. Those days are over, unfortunately. At least in the 90s and the 80s, they made the best out of it.
Anything else to add Matthew?
The aesthetics of the thing is one thing. Like, can you make it look and sound and feel like the thing you know and love? But it's when you take an idea and sort of spin it out or find some more use of it.
I mean, not to keep banging the Indiana Jones drum, but that arguably made a lot more of some of his core skills than some of the other recent films do. There's so much fun and there's just way more whip in that than there is in the film. It is right, though, that long, long gone are the days where this stuff was just like an absolute danger zone.
Now I'm quite excited to see what people kind of do colouring within the lines, I guess.
Yeah, for sure. I was quite intrigued to read this week that most of the, or a lot of the staff who worked on the Shadow of War games are the ones making that Black Panther game for EA. So really curious to see how that turns out based on that.
That might be quite good. And then obviously there's that Marvel game, Marvel 1942, I think it is. Yeah, the Amy Heddig game.
So one question I did have, it's something like Spider-Man, where you have the option to adapt a specific version of something which you already know, like the film version. You can make a game of the film or just to make a standalone, you know, your own version of Spider-Man. Does either of those excite you more than the other?
The standalone thing has proved to yield better games than the other approach, you know, like the not having the... I feel like maybe they did think at some point that the games might cross over when they did the Avengers Tower thing in Spider-Man, and then they took that dialogue out or something, and it was like a whole... And so maybe I just think they, you know, I think the speculation was that the Avengers game did not live up to anyone's expectations and they changed course or whatever, who knows.
But yeah, it's... I prefer it when it's a confident standalone approach, you know, the Spider-Man games from Insomniac and the Guardians of the Galaxy game from Eidos Montreal really just prove that.
The upcoming Bond game is an interesting case, because it feels like it's going to be its own version of Bond rather than based on a specific Bond film. Yeah. Because it's like a prequel or a younger Bond adventure.
So I am really curious, maybe specifically with that character, how that kind of works out.
When they did try and do the Daniel Craig Activision games, I mean, part of that was the games were just simply not good enough, right? But it was also just very clumsily integrated. You would wonder what it would have been like if you had, you know, IO making a game and it was still the heyday of Craig, where it's like, you can literally plug Craig into your game, then that suddenly becomes a lot tastier proposition, you know?
Whereas sticking him in GoldenEye, guess what? Didn't fucking work. And the game felt like it cost 10 pence to make as well.
So it's sort of...
Oh, if Daniel Craig Bond would never jump over Dan. That's ridiculous.
Yeah, it's just... And the fucking ITV1 ass 006 in it. I mean, you'll catch Sean Bean on ITV1 occasionally, but I'm just saying, you know, it just wasn't quite up to scratch.
So, you know, it was interesting because I always... Bloodstone is one of those games I've picked up and tried to play like four or five times, and the script in it is just so rough. And you're like, oh, you had Daniel Craig right there, and you could have put some like amazing dialogue in his mouth and told a great story, but you just didn't do it.
There are probably all kinds of like headaches to get in that kind of thing done and approved, but I suppose like that's the ideal, Matthew, but because of the different timelines of how games and films are made, it feels like it never comes together the way that anyone wants it to, you know? So, yeah. Okay, last question to Matthew, a bit of a novel question to end on.
I'm afraid we haven't got to everything this episode. As ever, we'll push these back to the next Mailbag, which we'll probably do in a couple of months, so we'll get back to that. I thought I'd end on a fun one, though.
If you got to design Big Sammy and Judge Castle joker cards for Bellatro Bellatro, what effects would they have and what would the artwork look like? And if they were both held at the same time, would they synergize and ultimately destroy each other? What have you got for this one, Matthew?
Well, there's already a Castle card in the game, and that gains, as you all know, it gains three chips for every card discarded in a set suit. So I thought I'd riff on that. Judge Castle, it basically does exactly the same, except I eat three potato chips every time a card is discarded in a set suit, and they just have to draw increasingly rotund versions of it.
My card design physically changes. It doesn't do anything for your hand, but it's quite novel, and I think people on the really long runs are curious to see just how many chips I can eat. That's like a meta game almost.
Yeah, that's good. I like that. So an additional currency of chips.
Of chips, as in like triple-cut chips.
Excellent. I like that. And then so yeah, I mean, I think we talked about this in a previous episode.
I think it might have been the Austin Powers episode maybe, but it's the, which comes up a lot. I mean, I feel like that episode is coming to define us a little bit on this podcast. I'd have like an I Wish You Well card.
I don't really know what it does. I think maybe it would like, it's like really fickle. So maybe it upgrades certain hands, but downgrades others based on my own bilateral preferences.
So two pair gets leveled up the wazoo by the I Wish You Well card. High card gets downgraded. That thing's down to minus 10.
Fuck high card. Flush is in the middle. I have no opinion on that.
So that doesn't really go up or down. But straight flush, fuck that shit. Royal flush, fuck all that shit.
That stuff gets downgraded instantly. So fickle pair, two pair, those are going up. Even three of a kind, I will tolerate, but yeah, the other combinations where I feel like, well, the RNG is going to fuck me too much to ever get this hand off the ground.
That's how that would work, Matthew. But how might the cards interact with each other? Do I try and steal your chips or something?
What happens there?
Well, I definitely think you're like peeved. Like maybe if your joker is put next to my joker, you get chip envy and it activates like a more angry, like amplified version of your card.
Maybe it's like a kind of like Patreon split bonus kind of status where I take half your chips because we split the money.
Yes, it could be that or it could be like as I get like fatter and fatter for my chips, you feel better and better about yourself and so you kind of chill out as a card and become more kind as a card.
Yeah, that's it. Your negative hands start going back up again, basically. And then yeah, and you only get the good bits of it.
That works quite well, I think. Yeah, okay, good. Well, we certainly labored that point.
So that's good. Um, Bolatro, what a game. Holy shit.
I'm still playing it. I feel like I'm reaching the point of madness with it a little bit. Like I've, I'm very close to unlocking the final deck in it.
And once I've done that and then done whatever and finish that deck, I might, might move on to the challenges, which I know everyone says is the proper sort of like fucks with your head tier of Bolatro, like the kind of meta game, sort of like the game beyond the game, basically. So yeah, look forward to that. Okay, Matthew.
Well, the podcast is over. And yep, I hope, thank you for your questions. They were, a lot of them were very thoughtful.
There was also that one about HP sauce and pizzas. But, but there were attempts were made. It was good.
I enjoyed it. Thank you very much. Pod Questions channel on the Discord, if you want to chuck in some questions for next time.
Like I say, we've got about five or six more from this episode. We didn't get to, we'll save those for next time. And yeah, we'll compile the best ones, read them out in the podcast.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrPazzaPesto on BlueSky and Letterboxd. That's it.
That's it, there's always a pause now. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on BlueSky, Twitter and Letterboxd as well.
And yep, follow us on those if you wish. And Back Page Pod is where you can follow the podcast on BlueSky and Twitter if you want to keep up to date with what's going on with the podcast, that kind of thing. Often use that to break little bits of news or whatever, but you can just generally kind of check up on what's going on with the pod.
And yeah, that's us done Matthew, goodbye.
Goodbye.
