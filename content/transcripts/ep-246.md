Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, what do you make of the reception to Silent Hill F, which the review embargo lifted on today as we're recording this, which will very much date this episode. But nonetheless, I love seeing a good split between seven out of tens and nines. I don't know about you, that's the sort of thing that gets me excited about video games.
What did you make of it?
Yeah, I'd agree with that. Yeah, interesting to see people wrestle with a game that I would say the consensus across the sevens and the nines is that some of it mechanically like the combat maybe isn't all that, but the story might be worth hanging around for. And depending on how much you can forgive the combat based on the strength of the story is where you'll end up landing on this one.
There's an undercurrent in a lot of the reviews that the game does something quite interesting on like replays or that playing it once isn't really the ending and that there's like substantial something to come in your second or even third play through. And they obviously can't talk about it for embargo reasons. But I feel like enough people have laid enough breadcrumbs that I'm super interested to see what that is.
Yeah, get that game in my fucking hands right now. I really, really want to play it like it's even like with the combat complaints, which I think people were already wary of that when they were doing the previews. But just the idea of something that's a little bit unknowable, but is also a horror game and that the themes of the horror game actually land, like what the story explores.
That's exactly what I want to hear about a new Silent Hill. So a friend pointed out to me today that which Silent Hill games do actually have good combat? You probably find the answer is zero if you really come down to it, because it's not a series that necessarily is best at that.
I think that is the case, but not that I'm saying the complaints are not fair. But it's nice to see people are still excited about it, and it's going to be one of those games I think that is valuable to talk about, to engage people on and to dig into. And that alone makes it intriguing to me.
So yeah, exciting.
It feels a bit to me like when a new M. Night Shyamalan film comes along, it may be an absolute stinker and his track record has definitely been off, but you're constantly thinking at the back of your head, well, once upon a time, this thing was really fucking good and really good at taking me by surprise. And if anything, there will be something at the end of this story that will be worth uncovering in Silent Hill, that, you know, the shape of those games.
You know at the end whether the goods were like really delivered.
Yeah. Would we say that Silent Hill 2 remake was the knock at the cabin of Silent Hill games, Matthew? Is that an apt metaphor?
I quite like that film. Did you see that one?
Yeah. Yes, I quite liked it.
Three and a half out of five for me, I think.
Yeah. Yeah. But I'm hoping Silent Hill F isn't the beach that makes you old or whatever it was called.
That the graphic novel that's based on is absolutely amazing. But I've not seen the film, but I'm really curious to see how he how he shat the bed with it. But yeah, it's a pretty pretty grim and heartbreaking graphic novel, like weird French graphic novel.
Right. I could see Shyamalan turning that into a two-star genre film. That's not out of the realms of possibility.
Okay, Matthew. Well, this episode, people know the deal by now. We've been doing these for the five years the podcast has been running.
The Best Games of the Different Year episodes, we are running out of years. I went back and listened to the 2016 one, Matthew. On that one, we passed comment on the fact that we're running out of years.
We recorded that episode in August 2023. It's been more than two years since we've returned to the modern chronology of these. We took a break and did our 01 to 05 quadrilogy, which went down really well.
We have decided behind the scenes that we're going to do, we're going to tackle 98, 99 and 2000 on the proviso that you don't go expecting like fun home-based anecdotes because they didn't happen because we're basically fetuses. That's the proviso there. How do you feel about all that time passing?
Because I went back and listened to it like I say, and the first thing you're talking about on it is the Idris Elba Apple TV show, Hijack, which feels like it was 400 years ago that came out. What are your thoughts, sir?
What on Idris Elba's Hijack?
Well, more unlike the fact that I guess like doing these episodes, but it's been so long since we came back to this, and I wondered if part of it was psychological, like we didn't want to dig into what ended up being some quite challenging years for us, you know?
Yeah, there was an element of that, definitely. Like we escaped to the innocence of childhood because it was easier than coming into some quite hard times. It's kind of weird though, it's like harder personal times, but some excellent gaming years, so you kind of have to, you know, one balances the other out, I guess.
Does it? I don't know. We'll see.
I mean, theoretically, sure. Why not?
You'd be the judge at the end of this episode.
That was going to be my next question, is, what is your general take on this year in games?
Gives us like a couple of bonafide masterpieces, gives us the Switch, you know, in itself, which is incredibly exciting. Kind of a year I admire and appreciate more in hindsight, because I think at the time, you know, as we'll get on to, I was really locked into the Xbox ecosystem because of my job, and that's arguably the worst place to be this year. Like, first party wise, obviously there's loads of great multi-format games, but if you are on a channel which is primarily about pushing first party games, this year was quite tough.
It's quite tough to be doing that when the Switch is happening elsewhere, and you just think, well, I'd like to be doing that instead. Feeling the sting of having no official Nintendo magazine to kind of give me that in, and seeing like Nintendo back on top again so instantly. Yeah, kind of frustrating in the moment, but obviously in hindsight, yeah, hugely satisfying.
You were mega locked in to what was going on on other platforms at this time though. Like I remember as some of these bigger Sony exclusives were rolling out around this year, and this is very much the era of the PS4 dominance, the narrative driven single player games that were selling like 10 million plus copies, and you know, were making game of the year lists. You were very much like, I remember you being like, I've bought my copy, I'm going to go home, I'm going to play it all weekend.
And you were very much paying attention to everything else going on. So I suppose I will dig into that a little bit more, I guess.
Yeah, I mean, I would say I'd maybe associate that a little bit more with like God of War and Last of Us Part II, like that, maybe that slightly later era. Yeah, I mean, you know, I was a punter, you know, rather than, you know, I wasn't, I didn't really consider myself a kind of games journalist in this year. So, you know, I was still enjoying things.
What were the big first party PlayStation games? I thought it was mainly Horizon this year. Wasn't really into, like, I think I came back to that much later and kind of locked into the story a bit more and saw the great elements of that game.
Definitely remember this being like a huge Nintendo year for me. But I think it will be reflected in the list that I've come up with in terms of what I was into.
The huge event that happens this year, of course, is that the Nintendo Switch does launch. And we have covered that pretty comprehensively on the Nintendo Switch draft we did early this year. We dug into the announcement and the kind of lead up to it.
And so while we'll talk about some of the same things here, I would say if you want our definitive take on that, you know, like a proper rundown of what that was like beat by beat, the Switch draft, I tried to tackle it as best I could. And Matthew remembered some parts of it firsthand. So it was good to get into that.
But a lot does happen. It's true that there's quite a bit of variance between the different platforms. Horizon was the main one.
There's also this like a Gran Turismo game that's out this year, but that's not really our domain. Gravity Rush 2, Matthew, which I know is one of your favorite games of all time. That happened this year.
I think this was maybe the year that the Crash Bandicoot thing was remastered happened. So I wish it well. It just felt like there was a lot of PlayStation stuff going on.
Uncharted 2's legacy, that was this year, right?
Yeah, it was. Yeah. So that's actually pretty sizable amount of stuff combined.
So it just definitely felt like we were living in the midst of PlayStation domination, and they did a really good job as well of making what was on the horizon seem like it was going to be important, and did end up being important. We'll dig into some of that stuff as we talk about the different E3s from this year. So if you've somehow never listened to one of these episodes, what we do is a bit of preamble where we talk about what was going on that year before we get into our top 10 lists and honorable mentions.
And something we discussed on the 2016 episode, which we're going to repeat here, is that we have talked about a lot of the games that are likely to come up in our lists at this point. And so in some ways, I think the preamble has become a bit more of the value of doing these episodes because there's just, there is quite a lot of context. Quite a lot does happen on an industry level that is interesting this year.
So I've made like a list of the major events that happened this year. And so you have the launch of Player Unknown's Battlegrounds. So basically the official start of Battle Royale is a phenomenon.
You have Fortnite that comes out later that year. And it was released in a kind of, the kind of Minecrafty version of it before they turned it into the Fortnite Battle Royale juggernaut that continues to be like one of the biggest games in the world to this day. So that's a huge thing that's happening in multiplayer.
Would I say it was interesting? Not really, but it was definitely a sort of novel genre to dig into. It's led to some really great games.
It felt refreshing, new. It was like the last exciting thing that really happened to multiplayer. You could argue that what's happening this year with games like Peak, Friendslop as it's been dubbed, is kind of an interesting move in that space too.
But as a phenomenon that really just took over the industry almost instantly, Battle Royale really was it at the time. You had the Xbox One X that was announced and launched this year, Matthew. Actually, it might have been announced the year before as Project Scorpio, but they properly revealed it and launched it.
It was basically the most powerful games console for a little while there from Microsoft, and them rewriting what the Xbox One was a little bit. Square Enix dropped IO Interactive this year, so we're all a bit worried about what's going to happen to Hitman. It worked out in the end, of course.
EA acquired Respawn this year. Kind of so far so good on that one, I guess, but let's see what happens after that third Jedi game comes out. Nintendo Switch launched, like we said.
SNES Classic launched this year, which more interesting because Star Fox 2 came out officially for the first time. Xbox Game Pass launched in June of this year. Another huge industry thing that happened is that there was a loot box event that occurred because Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Shadow of War, the Curse Lord of the Rings game, both had a loot box element to them that got massive backlash from people and became the domain of governments and industry bodies to argue about.
It was a huge thing that was very boring to write about if you were on a video game website at that time, and I say that with firsthand experience. So yeah, a lot there Matthew. Anything from that pile you wanted to pull out and discuss or you have any particular memories of?
We're obviously covering Xbox One X quite heavily on the channel. Even though it seemed quite niche and didn't necessarily have any games that particularly showed it off. Bar Forza 7, an incredibly boring game to me, unfortunately.
What I do remember from a work perspective, just the arrival of 4K if you were working in video, it was hugely disruptive. Not to get too lost in the weeds about video capture. All of a sudden, your 1080p capture cards and capture devices that you were using on PC up until that point suddenly didn't cut it.
And you needed to shift to these ridiculous capture units that they called like the Atomos Ninja and things like this, which you had to stick special drives in and 10 minutes of footage would be like 200 gigs.
Oh, fuck it out.
And the drives would be like 1 terabyte. And just everything became incredibly slow. This isn't something that I feel has improved at all.
Like now that is still how 4K capture happens. You know, when I was working on PlayStation Access, it's like a constant fight against limitations of storage on PC as you move around kind of like a terabyte of Spider-Man footage, which is just ludicrous. You know, I remember just going to E3 and the excitement of the 4K console is going to be there, the 4K console is going to be there.
And then just the realization of just what a huge pain in the ass that was going to be to video production. We all came away E3 with fucked 4 to 7 footage as well because they were trying to show off all the HDR stuff. And if you capture games when they've got HDR on, you need to then put a special like color filter on it to like match the actual color of the game, or it comes out super washed out.
So all the videos that came out of E3 were just these sort of dismal looking 4s to 7 where it looked like it was in fog constantly. And because it had all this realistic weather, you know, what happened on our team, and I imagine happened on a lot of teams, were people going, is it meant to look like that? Is that just like really good fog?
Or is the color fucked on this? Because we don't know how to catch a 4K yet. And yeah, it was very much the latter.
So a period of transition leading to professional woes.
I can't say the 4K thing was particularly convincing around this time. I mean, I had the PS4 Pro because my old PS4 around this time started to eject discs randomly in the middle of games, which was hell on earth. It started happening more prevalently when Spider-Man came out the next year, but it was like, it would just go, and start just chucking it out again.
I was like, fuck this. Then got my first ever bonus at work in 2018 and spent it on a PS4 Pro with Red Dead Redemption 2. I can't say I really noticed the difference.
I mean, even now, I'm a very 1440p, pro 1440p player. So the idea that it's caused you lots of headaches over the years is a bit funny, but also I can imagine that being a total fucking nightmare. Not something you have to worry about when you're writing the stuff up, obviously.
And also, on YouTube and stuff, who's ever really watching that stuff in 4K? I mean, if you're a Digital Foundry subscriber and you're watching it on their website, fair enough, you're getting that image at the resolution it's intended. Most of the time, you're still fucking looking at 720p and going, that's bullshit.
I can't even tell the difference. So it's not even the real thing.
I mean, yeah, with the extra YouTube's own compression on things as well. Yeah, who cares? It's dumb.
It kind of compresses 4K down to like what 1080 should probably look like if it wasn't fucked in the first place on YouTube.
Yeah.
That's all it does.
You know, they both had to have a horse in the race. And this generation, that's not really happened. There's been a PS5 one.
I don't know anyone who's got a PS5 Pro apart from you, Matthew. And the only way I would get one is if they say GTA 6 is 60 FPS on PS5 Pro. But I don't think they'll do that because I think they'll know that will cause too many fucking like headaches.
And I just can't see Rockstar doing it. I think they'll just save that for the next gen version they can sell you on PS6. I think that's what will happen there.
But you know, it's not really happened in the same way this this generation, you know, like the consoles we all bought five years ago are still going up in price. That is happening. It's a very different world to this, which was still, you know, the base consoles would drop in price.
They were reaching about 200 quid at this point.
So who knew early adopters would be the smart ones?
Well, I mean, yeah, that's certainly for the PSX will be buying it because I'm expecting it to quintuple in value over the course of the generation as humanity descends into complete chaos, Matthew. So Matthew, I did want to ask how your 2017 was. What were you up to more generally?
I was really in a very heavy work situation. I mean, this is when we talked about like, this isn't like the jolliest years for us. All I really did was work and panic about the Xbox YouTube channel, which is what I was running at the time.
And I'd been doing it for a few months. I took over in sort of autumn of 2016. By 2017, I'd sort of found my feet a little bit in terms of, okay, this is how we make video.
And you know, I have a sense of how to get through each week without having a meltdown. But then what kicks in when you do work in video, particularly when you post to YouTube, is the numbers start getting in your head. And something that I never really had on games magazines where you don't find out if an issue absolutely shit the bed until like three months later or something.
It's great, because then you're like, oh well, you know, what was I to do? That was ages ago. You know, on YouTube, you can see a video like eating it within like an hour.
This year, like my big lasting memory is, you know, we'd put our big video up on a Sunday at 5pm, that was our list feature. Which, back in the day, was the thing which all YouTube channels were made by, you know, outside Xbox for doing like 2 million views per list feature. We, as a very poor ripoff of outside Xbox, were also trying to do list features.
They'd go up at Sunday at 5 and by Sunday at 6pm. I'd know if that video was gonna kind of go on to be like a 100k video or like a 20k video. And if it was a 20k one, I'd be in like the foulest mood until the next Sunday 5pm.
That is just what it is to make stuff for YouTube. I think like even talking to people now who are highly successful at it, your whole life becomes defined by how the last bit of content did. And that combined with just being a bit of control freak meant I don't know, I just I really feel like this job owned me this year, an irritating year.
Some funny things happened along the way. But generally speaking, it was like, I don't know, I'd say probably the worst year of my professional life.
Yeah, I sort of, I remember how you're feeling at the time and what your sort of work entailed. And there was a certain period where us both having a bad time sort of dovetailed as well, we were both sort of in the thick of it. And I think we both had like, we, I think one of the reasons we get along is we both had existential moments in the last 10 years where we're like, did we make all the wrong choices in life?
And sometimes we're like, yes. And sometimes we're like, no. You know, look at us now, we're doing this podcast and we both get to do cool things that are in our day jobs.
But yeah, I've definitely, you definitely have those moments because just working in any kind of content creation, the economics of it or just some situation or some stakeholder or some shareholders, there's just some way it has to be a nightmare no matter what. There's no way in which it can just be like good and you get on with it and you make something good and you go, we did a good job there, you file it and you go home. That just never happens.
This has to be some other Ouroboros of like dog shit. And yeah, we've definitely had that in common at different times. So my 2017 was actually all right.
Good for you.
Okay, let me reframe this. This was not the worst year of my professional career. No, it was because at work this year, I went from running PC Gamer, the magazine, which I've been doing since the end of 2013.
So at this point, four years. And I was like, I can't do this anymore. I can't look at these mag numbers anymore.
I cannot look at these sales numbers. I cannot have. I think I'd just been doing print too long, living in that monthly cycle, which and just the toll it takes on your body and your mind.
Print is really hard, man. Anyone who does, I've got a massive amount of admiration for any games journalist still doing it and are able to do it for a long period of time because it's really grueling. But print in particular is just those monthly deadlines, the factors that have to kind of line up for things to work out.
I've really got a lot of like a lot of respect for it. But I had to nope the fuck out this year because I was just burnt out by it. And I was like, right, I'm either going to leave and do a PR job and applied for a few PR things.
Didn't get them. Or I was going to go work online. So I applied for a job on GamesRadar.
I was in contention for it. I was a potential of me getting it. But basically it was Tim on PC Gamer.
My boss has been on the podcast before, made it so I could work on the PC Gamer website as the UK Editor-in-Chief. So I went and did that and moved on from running the magazine. It was a good move and GamesRadar hired Sam Loveridge, who is brilliant at her job and a way better hire than I would have been to that website.
He's still there. So that all worked out very well, I think, for all involved.
Funny to have two Sams going for one row.
So I went from being in the print cycle to being on a website, and for the first time, full-time being like, what do I do with my time now? Because I know exactly what I was doing at all times on the magazine, but it becomes a bit more of a, we were publishing new stories without ever editing them, let's make sure we're doing an edit pass on them before they go up. Let's, you know, what sort of team features can we pull together that are fairly low-lift between myself and the online editor at the time, and all this kind of stuff.
And yeah, that was quite a big career transition. The other thing that prompted me moving away from print, other than it driving me completely mad, was that they were actually too high. So Future re-renovated their office and moved us on the desks with Bin.
Since I joined PC Gamer, what I understood to be like their long-time sort of floor and home, so where the games cage was and all that stuff, they got rid of all that. And they moved us to these, what kind of, it's like a nice, in theory, it's sort of like, it's like these rows of desks. So it's a bit less, you know, a bit less personal space.
But some parts of the office fared better than others here. Some parts looked a bit phone-sentry, and other parts looked kind of open-plan and quite nice. We were a bit in a bit more of a phone-sentry vibe.
So we're on this like row of desks. We had SFX behind us, no comment.
And then Tony Ellis, who was our longtime production editor left PC Gamer, because there was a thing that happened where the magazines went from having one production editor, which was always the case at Future, to having a production editor half the time, and then them being shared with another magazine, which was something that I believe happened when Future bought Imagine Publishing. I think probably would have happened anyway, just the economics of magazines. But Tony was like, no, I'm not going to do that.
I'm working on just PC Gamer. So he left at the start of the year. And I was quite heartbroken by that because I loved working with Tony.
We got on really, really well. I learned so much from him, just an incredibly smart guy, really great thinker about games, but just a phenomenal writer and editor, way better writer and editor than I've ever been. And so him going made me feel like, it's probably over now.
My time doing this is probably over. I had Phil Savage as my deputy editor who was brilliant. And so I thought, well, he could definitely run the magazine.
So that happened. Someone else left as well on the website side had been working. I've been working with for a long time there.
So it just felt like the right moments to for a change. And so I did that Matthew. And basically just tried to work out how online stuff functions.
I don't know. Do you have any reflections on that? Like I think we both reached the same point at the same time of like, I don't think I can do print media anymore.
I just can't really keep doing it because I feel like I'm swimming upstream and I'm just, and it's not fun anymore, you know?
Yes. And then diving into something where you have to learn new skills and a new way of working. I mean, admittedly, I think what, you know, going to online is, you know, it's still, there's a lot of writing involved and it's still kind of magazine adjacent as opposed to sort of leaping headfirst into video with zero video experience.
So yeah, I kind of get that. It's sort of a romantic part of your brain wants to, you know, it would have been fun to have sort of written it out to the very end rather than just sort of have to sort of shrug off the thing which we're both quite naturally good at, magazine making particularly and being like, well, that's that sort of stepping away from something. No one forced me to leave print journalism.
When you do see some of it still existing, you think, oh, you know, well, I wonder, should I, you know, could I have written this out for another, you know, 10 years or something?
What Chris Schilling is doing is cool. I was like, yeah, I would quite like to have done that, you know?
Yeah, that is cool. And that's the thing you couldn't have predicted probably back then was that in the sort of magazine vacuum, you would end up with this tier of, I don't even, we haven't got a collective term for them yet, but sort of artisan, elite print products, which come out, you know, once a year or focus on a particular game, you know, tread the line between magazine and coffee table book. And that's so exciting.
And it's great to see, you know, a lot of those outfits have kind of mopped up a lot of print talent, but I don't feel like in 2017 that was happening.
No.
Like I don't know if you would have been like, oh, I'll just go and do that instead.
No, it's sort of, that didn't even vaguely seem like it was a career path. I was sort of, the whole time I was working in magazines, I was like, what will I do next? Because if I ride this out till it's over, then am I just going to be seen as a dinosaur to anyone who looks at my CV?
So, consciously moving to online was like, well, I can say I can do all of this different stuff and maybe that will lead to something. But you know what actually, having all those online skills, every time I ever applied for a community manager job, I got nowhere. So I feel like maybe that no one did take that seriously.
Even when I'd be like, yeah, I ran PCGamers social media channels, had like four million collective followers, more than your games do. You know, so a bigger audience than your games do.
Did you say that in the interviews? Because I can understand why that might not have worked.
I did not. But it was a bit like, yeah, okay, you know, fine, go hire some 22 year old who's, you know, had like one viral TikTok video. Well done.
Here's your round of applause. Congratulations on your great hiring. I've been, maybe I'll be working in games too long.
But it's quite exciting to be able to fire something out on the PC Gamer website and just see it really take off. And, you know, the PC Gamer website, you know, what is your beat? I think that's how we worked on the website when I was on this year.
What is your beat? Because you're going to write about that. You're going to be the expert of that one thing.
And I took on GTA Online as one of my beats. So I was like, well, I don't really, I'm a generalist. You know, this podcast is all about how both of us are generalists, really, for the most part.
But I took it on. I was like, right, I'm going to write about that one thing. Every time there's a major update, I'm going to play it.
I'm going to pay attention to Reddit and see what people are talking about. And that's still how PC Gamer runs now, you know. They got their online writers.
They got a sort of Rich Stanton speech seems to be sort of like a sort of PC gaming adjacent tech phenomena, for example. Like you can sort of see that there are certain writers who write about certain things. You know, when they have Rick Lane doing freelance, you're like, yeah, well, I'm going to write, I'm going to read about first person games when Rick Lane's writing on PC Gamer.
So very much like what the, you know, the site success was forged in these years and it was fun to learn about it and be a part of it. You know, all of the parts of the job that were great, remained great while I was on it, it was all the non-website parts that made it bad or like the extraneous elements that shouldn't really have anything to do with running a website. So yeah, it was interesting to learn that and challenging in different ways.
But I did think about this as the final one of these, where either of us will have original print media stuff that we've done. Maybe I'll talk a bit about the issues. I worked on this year, I'll just mention some of the covers I did.
More exciting than me telling you about all the tips videos I made on Xbox One.
Well, you know, I appreciate that too. The first issue that we published this year was a Prey cover. Went with the very cheeky headline of Meet the New Bioshock.
And it just had the most beautiful art, Prey. Then it was Mass Effect Andromeda. That was a bit more of a Craven commercial push, but that game didn't turn out very good, obviously.
But a nice piece of cover art. Got like two interviews for it. It was okay.
But one of the most interesting covers I did, Mount and Blade 2 Bannerlord. And they just like completely blew open the doors for that one. And it's such a pure, died in the wall, PC Gamer game that I was just really chuffed with it.
You know, to look at the cover art, you would say it's just a man on a horseback. It could be one of a million games. But I was really chuffed with it as a thing that we did.
Then we did Dawn of War III, did loads of those covers because they always sold quite well. Battlefront II, okay, that was more cravenly commercial. And so too was Total War Warhammer II, actually, to be honest.
Then we did Destiny 2, which came to PC for the first time. But I wanted to mention this cover, Matthew, because that's when we had to do one of the most foolhardy things I've ever agreed to in running a magazine, which was a review index of every PC Gamer score of all time printed on one big poster.
Oh, man.
Over 5,000 games, some of the scores for which were missing from certain issues that had gone missing and required like tracking down what the scores were in those issues through like means fair or foul. Like it was honestly an absolute nightmare. And then to proofread it, the tiny, tiny text on this giant fucking InDesign file, after you just zoom right in on all the different bits in order for it to be, the text for even to be visible.
I mean, man, just, why did I do that?
I don't even understand the value of that. Having that on your wall, it would just be a load of tiny numbers that you can't read unless you press right up against it. It's not a beautiful thing.
Like there's no image on that poster. It may as well just be like a white rectangle because that's probably what it would look like from a distance. But if you get close enough, you can see, oh, it actually comprises 5,000 numbers.
Oh, The Secret of Monkey Island, 86%. Yeah, it was ridiculous because I also thought, it's not even a useful reference for people who want to know the scores because you have to unfold this poster and find the relevant bit of the poster in order to actually, I mean, terrible idea. That came in a slip case.
I think it sold pretty well because I think people were genuinely curious about, well, why have they done this? Maybe they thought it would be in a better form than we presented. I was honestly, I was really like, John Strike did a great job with it and bless Tony Ellis.
He looked incredibly, I think he was still there at this point for this bit of it. Then I think like just, if this didn't force him to resign, then nothing else would basically.
I hope in 30 years time when they're doing period set dramas in 2017, they illustrate that by having a boy's bedroom with the PC Gamer 5000 score poster on the wall, and people being like, that's pure 2017. Because who else is making posters in 2017 other than fucking magazines?
It's true, it's true. The final issue of PC Gamer that I edited was the XCOM 2 War of the Chosen cover that we did, where I think Jake Solomon came to our office for that one. And yeah, and then we ended up ordering, I think we fetched everyone Smash Burger.
I think Jake Solomon's worth more than Smash Burger, but that was, I think it was right over the road from the office, Matthew.
So you could have taken him to that Chinese restaurant that everyone thinks is an estate agents.
Yeah, I did consider it, but then I thought, why are you taking me to this place to buy property? I came here to eat food. That was quite novel.
I mean, that became rarer and rarer, but every now and then you would have PRs bring developers into the office. I think the only ones I can really remember were I met the guy who designed Kenshi. Also, David Braben came into the office, I remember.
I think he was brought in for Elite Dangerous, but it didn't happen very often. Oh, wasn't that guy who did, he was one of the main LucasArts guys, Gilbert, Ron Gilbert. Didn't he come into the office?
Were you there for that? When he came into the office?
Did he come in and systematically look at each individual object in the office and describe it? I'm looking at some print paper. It doesn't seem very interesting.
Yeah, he did use on every single object his absolute chaos.
That would have been a great bit. If I was him, I'd do that all the time, and I'd start to try to combine random things.
Yeah, so those were like, now that I read them out loud, not very interesting. I think I was mostly just thinking of the Prey and Mount and Blade 2 band lord covers.
That's good. I mean, you know.
I just, yeah.
To get away with any cover that you're proud of in late era magazines is an achievement.
In the moment, all you're really doing is trying to make the decisions that make the thing sell properly, keep people in their jobs, et cetera. I don't know. No regrets and all that apart from all the regrets that I clearly have in talking about this.
I've now got an image of Ron Gilbert looking at a poster with 5,000 scores and trying to describe that.
Oh dear.
I'm glad that you managed to get away some work that you were proud of because the few things that I really do remember this year was having panic attacks about what I would call impossible briefs for me personally. Have I ever told you about the NFL videos?
No, I don't think so.
Every year you'd get this push on XBox On to try and make American sports games happen in the UK, which was very much beyond my powers as a video producer on one YouTube channel. I don't think I was going to make NFL take off in the UK, but to try and get NFL to land in 2017, we decided to do a series of videos where one of our hosts, Lydia, would challenge an NFL player to play a game of Madden because a load of NFL guys were going to come over for... There's some reason some NFL teams come to the UK every year to play like a promotional game or two and as a result, they were going to have some kind of party attached to this and so Xbox thought it would be really funny if Lydia has to play this NFL player at this thing.
So the first part of this was I had to write a script for an NFL player called Ndomekong Su, who played for the Miami Dolphins. I think I'm saying that right. Apologies to him if I'm not, and I've never been more stumped by a bit of writing than how an NFL player would challenge Lydia to this game of Madden.
Because his whole deal, I watched lots of videos of him, interviews with him. I think he had a bit of a reputation for being quite a, like a very kind of a, not dirty player, but kind of quite aggressive player. An absolutely huge guy, goes without saying.
But I think he was a bit of a, I found lots of posts where people were like, this guy's got a fucking horrible attitude to the sport and all this kind of stuff. So I was like, well, how the fuck, you know, everything I wrote, it just sounded like me. You know, like, it doesn't say hello.
Does he say hello? You know, I was sitting there. And he'd be like, hi there.
And you know, hello, hello, it's me. You know, and so, you know, you ended up with this incredibly unconvincing video of this huge American dude, like sounding the least like himself ever. And he sort of filmed it on his mobile phone in like a really dark room.
So this is quite big, sort of angry face emerging from the darkness of this room, saying that he's going to destroy Lydia. He doesn't know who Lydia is. He doesn't know who we are, but challenging her to this game of Madden.
And you know, I thought, well, that's definitely going to be the hardest bit of this, is getting that to land. But then it was realizing that actually we had no fucking idea how to play Madden. And it was just impossible to teach someone how to understand American football.
We went to NFL's UK headquarters and had them try to teach us, legitimately try and teach us, to like be able to pass enough of Madden that we could play it in a video without like fucking it up. And just an absolute fucking disaster. Like going to this Super Bowl party, Lydia having to play this guy, she's fucking rubbish at it.
No offence to her. Like she didn't understand the controls. It's not an easy game to pick up.
No, I couldn't do it.
Him clearly being very angry that he had to do anything that wasn't hang out with his friends at this party, that he'd somehow been singled out as the guy who had to come and sit with us, you know, all for a load of videos that did about like 4,000 views each. And it was just hanging over me for months, this thing. Like it wouldn't go away, this fucking NFL video.
The apps, that was the absolute pits. I also had to redesign the Xbox on set, which is just not a thing you ever really think about. I'm not an art guy, but I had to design this layout and then organise the building of it.
I really did everything on that channel. And trying to organise builders to come in and put up all the fake Brit work. Do you know Graham Boyd, aka ACBongos?
Yes, I do.
Yeah, so he's like one of the UK faces of Xbox, who often does a lot of their Gamescom stuff. I haven't seen him for years. I don't really know what he does now, if he still does that stuff.
But he was kind of like the UK Major Nelson, is probably the best way of framing it. And to decorate the set, he gave us his personal collection of limited edition Xbox controllers that he'd amassed over the years. And so many of those things got fucking broken in our office.
And they were like one of a kind, you know, like controllers that were given to employees for being there at certain points, like when like certain games launched, you know, they were engraved, they had dates, they had limited numbers on them. Genuinely, like a huge part of my year was just fretting about this incredibly rare set of controllers that I had no control over, like protecting the security of these things, always falling off shelves. Every time one of those things fell off a shelf, I thought, oh god, you know, a piece of Xbox history is like shattered on our hard hard floor, and I'm gonna have to break this to AC Bungos.
Challenges I'm not built to deal with, you know, things I shouldn't, I have nothing in my skillset suggests that I'd be able to do these things. So that's kind of like the emotional register I was just working at this whole year. Right for this footballer, you've just broken something really precious, you've just got to apologize for it.
Weird tough times.
Yeah, I was telling to my parents about this actually, because my mum is the same type of intelligence that I am, which is we are good problem solvers and good talkers, and that is all we are. We have no real skills, we're just good at solving problems. And I honestly think that making your way through professional life, being able to solve problems, as they come up, is the best skill you can have.
And you constantly will find yourself in situations that you don't understand, you know, or where there is a comprehension barrier. And you just have to make the best of it. And if you're able to make the best of it and everyone's still alive afterwards and everyone's still employed, that's considered like a win.
So what I would say is that I'm the same as you, but all I do is just, I think I just hide it quite well when I just don't know what I'm doing, because I think I would fare exactly as well as you did in the NFL situation there. So I totally understand the idea of like, this seems like such a fucking mountain to climb, how will we ever do this? Not being happy with the end result, but nonetheless moving on, accepted that a thing happened and that life could continue.
That's tough. But I'm guessing you would encounter escalating versions of this as time went on in this job, Matthew?
Yeah, yeah, pretty much. Because I think at the same time, the part of my brain that takes pride in work was still trying to make the list features good, and anything written, I wanted it to be of a good standard. So that's the kind of stuff I probably should have stepped back from a little bit.
I probably should have allowed the channel to be more naturally in the voices of the host, rather than speaking through the host by doing most of the writing myself, whilst also dealing with these producer challenges, which were fundamentally the thing I was paid to do, but the thing I was good at, I never felt further removed from it. Yeah, that was stressful. I will say, just so it's not all doom and gloom, I did get to do some great Switch freelance this year.
I wrote GamesRadar's Breath of the World review, and just being thrown the occasional bone from the old world was enough to reset my sanity meter for a couple of weeks. It's like, what's the thing in amnesia? Like being in a room with a candle or something.
You're just like, oh, thank god, the fucking Slender Man… I know I'm mixing my characters here. The fucking Slender Man's not going to get me for a week because I played Breath of the Wild and got to write about it.
I had a little moment where you're completely reminded of your older self and you're like, oh, good, it still exists, it's still in there somewhere. Right back to writing scripts for Endamakung Su.
The funny thing is that I think you are always in a push and pull between those two things just from having known you.
Yeah.
And it's the thing that fundamentally drives you mad. The thing that you have to do versus the thing that you feel like you should be doing, like that is like your big thing. Like just, is that fair?
Yeah. No, that is true. I think whoever, if I ever pay to go to therapy, that's probably what we would land on.
To make it, to balance it out, what's my big thing? What's wrong with me, Matthew? Diagnose me on the podcast.
Oh, I wouldn't dare diagnose you, Sam.
Was it just caused too much damage to the podcast partnership?
Oh, yeah. That's what we'll do in Episode 300. I'll diagnose you and that will just be the end of it.
Okay. Well, that is alarming. With that, I will move on to the discussion of press strips of this year, Matthew.
I remember very little about what I played at this E3, but I remember the actual E3 itself, because it's when I went to the Murder House with a bunch of staff writers and different future mags. So this was just, it's definitely come up before, probably came up in the episode, Jem Was On, because Jem was in the Murder House. And I shared a bed with OXM's James Nouch, because there weren't enough beds in this house, through all the writers who went there.
I remember the morning I woke up from a hangover and I'd snored so loudly, I don't think he got a wink of sleep, and I'll always remember the look of horror he gave me, of like, you have ruined my life, sir. I'll never forget that.
I've got this image of like a real kind of planes, trains and automobiles, John Candin, Steve Martin in a bed together.
Yeah. It was not dissimilar, I guess. It was very sort of civil, but it was a bit like, we won't talk about the fact that we are sharing a bed and how ridiculous that is.
Like, we'll just be like, we'll just get on with our business, but we just happened to share the same bed. Yeah. Yes.
So we did that, and the house was just in this, it was within walking distance of the LA Convention Center, and that's not a good thing, trust me. You go under this bridge to get there, and it just turns into the nastiest neighborhood so quickly. Everyone we talked to about it was like, do not walk back there, get a cab.
I remember I did decide to walk to the convention center from there one day, and this car pulled up next to me, and there's like four people in the car, they all stared at me, and then they went, pass me that on the ground, and it was like a can that had been stepped on, and I didn't know why or what they were talking about, but they were like, pass me that can, I just did nothing, I just froze on the spot, and like this one guy got out of the car, and then at that point I just started panicking, and he just picked up this can that had been crushed, climbed back in the car and drove off, and I was like, what the fuck is wrong with this thing? This is so gross.
It must have had either a spy message inside or drugs.
This was like a real step down from the year before when I think Future US booked our hotels, and they were like, it was a really nice Koreatown hotel and much more relaxed, and I was like, right, from this year onwards I vow I will get Rebellion to pay for my E3 hotels and I will cover anything they want me to. Any old Sniper Elite sort of spinoff you can name, I will cover it just to not stay in one of these awful hotels. But I remember watching the E3 conferences from the living room in this place.
It had a door that we didn't know where it went, but there's clearly more of the house, and we were like, is that where the sort of parasite style, the sort of like actual owner lives underground or something like that? Lots of weird mysteries to this awful house. So I remember that, Matthew.
I have some other press trip stories from this year, but I'm wondering if you had any you wanted to share?
I did a Porsche track day for Forza 7, which if you're a long-term listener and you remember the years where I was learning to drive, I'm not a person you should put behind the wheel of an incredibly expensive Porsche, but I did it anyway. What was hilarious about this is I hadn't driven in about, I don't know, 13, 14 years at this point, and I said to the guy at the thing, I've actually got a bit of a mental block about driving, but as I'm here, I feel like I should at least give it a go. But the activity we were doing on the track was, it had this device designed to put your car in a spin, because it was for training people to do very fast driving in these cars and to show off, I don't know, some kind of steering technology that helped you get out of a spin.
But take an already nervous driver and put them on a stretch of road and they're like halfway down this bit of road, something's going to happen that's going to make this car go wrong and you're just going to have to deal with it. And this guy was in the car talking me through it, but that was really stressful. But I did do it and I drove some very, very expensive cars.
Couldn't tell you what they are. I'm not a car person, I'm afraid. Yeah, and I came away from that.
For about two days I thought maybe I should start driving again. If I managed to do that, then maybe I could get behind the wheel. But then I came to my senses and I've gone back to being a permanent passenger driving Mr. Castle for poor old Kevin.
A classic.
An Oscar-winning classic.
Yeah. But no spinning out, which is good. I did go to E3 this year.
I had a horrible E3, in keeping with the rest of the year. I'd never done a video E3 before. Like normally I'd go there, absorb everything and then write it up.
But the idea of like producing, editing and uploading videos out in the field, that was a big wake up call. I had this big plan of content we were going to do. And then, you know, I think we managed to make like four videos when we were out there.
I had quite an unfortunate thing happen. I'll remove the names, so not to upset anyone. But a member of my team had a horrendous breakup with their partner just like three days before E3.
Their partner who was also out at E3 to serve as a constant reminder of the thing they were upset about. Basically, the videos we made were the ten minute bits of that week where they could have possibly been filmed because they hadn't turned to jelly. And I just couldn't believe that on top of the stress of doing all this video stuff, I was having to deal with this emotional fallout.
A thing I was just not trained to do. I had never been more stressed in that week. And then trying to get a literally weeping person to stop weeping so that they could talk about fucking Shadows of War for five minutes.
Come on. It was like I was being punked. I couldn't believe it.
There's a famous… I say famous. There is a picture from this E3 that Sam White occasionally posts on social media.
He's in a massive queue to get into an Xbox area. And I seem to be pushing in at the front because I was out there with Xbox. And I'm giving him like a sort of shit-eating grin and like the A-OK symbol.
As if to say, like, don't worry, I got in. And every time I see that, I think, well, actually, like it may look like I'm having a great time in that photo. But I'm…
that's the one frame of E3 where I was maybe having a good time, was laughing at Sam White not being able to get into this demo room. The rest of it, abysmal. Truly terrible times.
My video editor lost his passport on the last day, and I had to do… I had to run back to the hotel to try and get the passport and then get to the airport so I didn't miss my flight. That was a nightmare.
That's quite a long story. I'll have to tell that another time because I don't want to, like, fill up 15 minutes. But it was, oh my, my blood pressure.
This is the year I, like, put on loads of weight. This is the year I stopped being, like, my thin teenage self finally, just because of, yeah, dealing with all this stuff. I wish I could have enjoyed it because we were out there with Xbox.
I had the easiest access in the world. Like, if I wanted to see something, I could absolutely see it. You know, we had dinner with Rare.
They were there with Sea of Thieves. I watched the E3 conference sitting next to Mike Chapman from Rare, talked to him for like three hours, which was probably hell for him. But like, just to be able to talk to someone, not really as a journalist, but, you know, with my journalist sort of brain, but also just sort of, I guess, under sort of friendier, no, what's it called?
Friend? Friendier?
Yeah, friendier.
Friendier, yes, that's it. And yeah, just to be able to talk quite openly about what he was working on at Sea of Thieves and like being at Rare and all this kind of stuff. Oh, it was fantastic, you know, that stuff.
So many good moments. But what I remember is, is just trying to stop all those tears. Oh my God.
I mean, I just, you just couldn't make it up.
That's not fun. That's not a fun story. That's tough.
I got no enjoyment at all out of that one.
Sorry.
That's, no, that's okay. That's, you know, that's what the reality was for you at the time. I remember, I remember like the state of mind you're in during these years.
It was, yeah, I remember so little about the actual like being there at the E3. Like I was, I had to Google the show floor just to remind myself. And I remember there's this absolutely beautiful like Spider-Man display there where he was back.
He was like on top of a helicopter that was kind of like webbed up in the, in like the middle of the PlayStation area. And it was like, it was like hanging overhead as you're walking under it. It was like a really impressive display.
But that's the only thing I can really remember. It's a complete blur to me, this one. Like I don't think the conferences were that exciting in retrospect.
Like Sony had just had two really great years before this. And the Xbox One is sort of like, you sort of notice in their E3 conference that, you know, the One X is front and center. And then it's mostly propped up by third party games apart from Forza 7 and C of Things like you mentioned, Matthew.
Cuphead, they sort of owned Cuphead to a certain degree in those early days. I think it was an Xbox exclusive to begin with. Is that right?
Yeah. Yeah, that is right. I believe that was the case.
That was quite big. I remember at their preview event playing quite an early demo of, oh, what the hell was it called? There was this like sort of Rock Opera space game where you sort of like played a guitar as you slid down slides in space.
What was that game?
That's the game that became The Artful Escape.
Artful Escape, that was it. The demo of that, it was absolutely brilliant. And given all the other shit that was going on, anything that gave me like a smidgen of happiness.
I remember coming away from E3 thinking, The Artful Escape is like the game of the show. That's the best thing I've ever played. It's a bit like when you watch a film on a plane and your head's just not in the right place to watch a film and you come away thinking, some terrible piece of shit is like a five-star masterpiece.
It wasn't a terrible piece of shit. Artful Escape's absolutely fine, but yeah. I just...
A man playing a guitar as he slid down a slope was just what I needed to heal me for a few minutes. That restored the sanity meter to go back to my amnesia metaphor.
I want to throw in a third metaphor there and say, that's Matthew wiping up the blood in the toilet from the opening of Fahrenheit. That's like him. That's his sanity meter dropping there.
That's him like, I've dealt with the body. The police are coming, but I'm trying to keep it together. Stay of mind, basically, you know?
I hate this. When we got to the airport, I said to the team, I can't deal with anyone on this team right now. I'm so cross.
Because of the last few days, I'm just going to go home by myself. I'm going to just go through the airport by myself. And I went off and really angrily ate a terrible pizza in the airport.
LAX are such shite food. Just awful. I did have some more trip stories to chuck into the mix, Matthew.
Because I went to a Star Wars celebration for Star Wars Battlefront 2. EA flew us out there. I don't think we knew about the loot box thing where they took us out there.
You would have still gone. Definitely.
As soon as I knew what the trip was, I was well in. It was in Orlando. We were staying in a hotel right near or a bunch of the theme parks are.
You couldn't really walk anywhere except the tiniest little strip of restaurants that you could access. Because it's that kind of state, you just have to drive everywhere. But we were in this massive hotel that had happy hour, I think it's like six to eight every day.
So we just come back from the convention, just get wankered on Budweiser. You have to drink a lot of Budweiser to get wankered, but then just be completely buzzed to set up the evening. I would say, I think we were there for three or four days.
Maybe it's just three days, but very, very, very fun. The least fun part of it though was the fact that I had to write the cover feature while I was there, it's that old one. Then somehow send it when I landed.
I mean, just ridiculous, really. Stuff that I would never have the stamina to do now. But yeah, it was pretty exciting.
It was the year that The Last Jedi was out, so it was like a proper full force, so to speak, cast pushed, saw John Boyega there, saw Anthony Daniels there. It was pretty cool. I realized that I was not as big a Star Wars fan as some of the people I was on the trip with because they all started playing little card games and miniatures games while we were in different areas.
I was like, maybe I'm just like a superficial Star Wars fan.
You must still look like the fucking Fonz on that trip.
If only. Then on the way back, I remember I was in Dave Jackson, your colleague, now, his car with two other people who had been on the trip, and his tire burst in the middle of a motorway, and we were stranded by the edge of a motorway, all of us jet-lagged, and had to be picked up and dropped off back in baths. It was like a nine-hour journey back into baths or something like that.
That was a bit of a weird... I think we all hugged at the end of it because we've been through a life-changing experience, which is preposterous, but it did seem that way.
I thought you were going to say, Dave played some awful Star Wars music all the way home or something, like just the Cantina theme tune, but got stuck on the car radio, and we got stuck out on the road with that for nine hours.
The thing is, I remember the Battlefront 2 pitch being pretty good because they were like, oh yeah, we've got a proper single-player story this time. We've got maps from all three trilogies. We've done all that stuff.
We've got proper space combat. It's been designed by Criterion. I mean, the loot box story became the story, but in the hype cycle of it, it seemed like, oh, this is going to be really good, and then it just went horribly, horribly wrong, and now the pendulum has swung too far back the other way, which has also been very annoying, but that's been covered in a previous episode, the revisionism around this game.
I also went to Vancouver for the first and only time I've ever been there, Matthew. I went for Dawn of War III to Relic, a very doomed game, this game. It's literally a fourth one being made right now that is not being worked on by the studio.
That's perhaps a sign of how things did not work out with this game. But I got so incredibly ill on this trip that I was coughing up blood. I think I had the flu or something.
But I was desperately trying to hide this from the Sega PR I was out there with. And then like one point and a half, I was just like spluttering and like nose running and like trying my best to hide it, but it became increasingly obvious.
It's like the person who's been bitten in a zombie film doesn't want to be caught out.
I was, yeah, there was definitely that vibe to it. And then the last day we went into this Vancouver's Modern Art Museum, which is an absolutely incredible building. And we sat in this room that was like this full wall display of like this camera panning in and out of this animated piece of artwork into all these different apartments, this giant apartment complex.
And I felt like I was going to die in the dark watching that. In the way that Tom Cruise is left for dead in the end of Collateral on that train, where he seems like he's another commuter, I was sort of like, if the Sega PR just walks out of it, I think I'm going to die here. I think this is like the end of my life.
And that was not good, because I distinctly remember the day before the trip being like, just sort of like I'm walking home to my flat and being like, I can feel a slight sniffle coming along. And then it just escalating as I go through the flight and the trip and just being like, I am not okay. And like I coughed up blood for like about a week and a half afterwards and eventually recovered.
But there must've been like some really bad chest infection or something. But good lord, that was hell on earth. Yeah I was not okay.
I mean, who knows if you could even, who knows what was in the text for that cover feature. Like whether the testimony could even be relied upon as accurate. I was just so ill.
I remembered so little of it afterwards.
This would be really back and realize that the preview handed in was actually of that weird art installation. Oh shit, this wasn't even the game.
Yeah and then I just wrote, and so I feared that Sega PR man would leave me to die. Then just a PC Gamer logo. Yeah, not a good time.
But yeah, just sort of like, why was I going on all these trips and writing these features? Why didn't I just send my staff to write them? It was silly really.
The answer was Matthew because one of them had Star Wars in it. That's why I went on that trip.
And you were the only person on PC Gamer who liked Star Wars.
On the magazine part of the time. I think I was the only person actually. So anyway.
So yeah, very quickly, I'll just fire through the E3 conferences from this year. Matthew, they're not very interesting, like I say, but it is one of the last big E3s. Bethesda and Ubisoft, EA as well actually, all have a presence here.
I remember EA's one being in the middle of Hollywood or something and being like a $50 cab journey and back to get there. I just remember thinking that wasn't worth it just to play a way out and not play Battlefront 2. I remember thinking this sucks.
That wasn't good. So yeah, the Xbox, like I say, One X leads things. I don't think there's loads to get into here, to be honest.
It's just a list of third-party games that were from the time. The most interesting thing that really happens in it is that they add original Xbox games backwards compatible. So you have Crimson Skies added here.
That's definitely the highlight of the live stream for me. Great game. And it ends with the reveal of Anthem, Bioware's Anthem.
And it's quite an annoying reveal to watch back because you know just like A, what they were showing was not even vaguely close to being an actual video game. Because when the actual game came along, there were so little game in it, you were like, well, clearly that was never the case what this game was. It's just this very detailed narrative stuff and then this sort of turns into this like Monster Hunter-y Iron Man thing and you're like, oh yeah, this does look cool.
It's an incredible presentation if they revealed it now and they're like, we're making this game. It still looks graphically like a game would now. But clearly just like nonsense and then it's just so fake and then it's like, yes, coming next year.
And then when you end up reading the behind the scenes of what happened to the game, you're like, I don't think even in proper production at this point on the game, they were still in pre-production for such a long time on this game and they just ended up with no game content. I mean, just a real bummer. But in the moment, it was like, oh, finally, Bioware is doing something new and exciting.
And it was just like, I don't know, just ended in so many tears, didn't it? It wasn't good. So that was Xbox.
Sony, I don't remember anything about this one. It wasn't quite as big an event as the one before, which had the God of War reveal where you don't know exactly what you're watching and then Kratos is there at that tree with his axe. And you're like, oh, everyone in the crowd just completely lost their minds and got really excited about it.
So that hadn't come out yet, but they were kind of hyping it up. Uncharted Lost Legacy is in here. There's DLC for Horizon, Days Gone, which is Matthew's favorite PlayStation 4 exclusive.
Sean Layden came on stage, talked a bit. That's a guy who knew how to run Sony, I would say. You know, just many good games happened under his watch.
Great bat vibes.
Definitely. It just seems like he's a really smart dude. Yeah, Monster Hunter World Reveal was here.
Shadow Colossus remake, probably their big reveal here. But then they give a massive chunk of the show to Spider-Man at the end and clearly that just gets people massively hyped up. It's a big deal that finally there's going to be a good Spider-Man game and Insomniac is working on it, taking it very seriously.
Nintendo was one of their direct or spotlights or something they called it, Matthew. The Switch had already launched at this point, so obviously Breath of the Wild was out there, but ZX Chronicles 2 was here, Kirby Star Allies, Metro Prime 4 was announced here. As we know, we thought Namco were making it for a while, then Retro ended up doing it, and the game is still not out as of this recording.
It will finally be out this December. There's some Yoshi nonsense in here, Fire Emblem Warriors, a Breath of the World expansion pass, which I never ever played, the stuff in that, and then a big Mario Odyssey showcase, and some Pokébon nonsense. Any observations on the Nintendo stuff here, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, I don't specifically remember this E3 conference, or this showcase, because being out of the show, I don't think I had time to watch it. Exciting games, mad that Metroid Prime 4 was back then. That's just crazy to me, but I guess it takes that long to make a big empty desert.
Still on that, eh?
Yes. And, you know, obviously Mario Odyssey, very exciting. Yeah, it's sort of fine.
Kirby Star Allies, that's fine. Some Yoshi nonsense, that's fine.
Yeah, fair enough. It was, yeah, I actually remember being in Murder House, and there being, like, a big box of sort of Krispy Kreme doughnuts on the, on, like, the table, while John, John Porter, I think it was, from TechRadar was there with all of us watching this, and everyone was like, yeah, when Metroid Prime 4 was announced, and it is funny thinking that eight years would pass and the game would still not be out, and somehow, yes, we are here. Last thing I want to ask Matthew, before we get to the actual list, is do you have any memories of pop culture from this year?
Yeah, I mean, this is an important year, because Rian Johnson finally makes a good Star Wars film. An incredible moment. I remember, okay, I'm behind being facetious, but I love The Last Jedi, and we went to see it for the Yogscast Christmas party, and we came out and everyone was just dunking on it and nitpicking, all the kind of tedious shit that we've come to associate with The Last Jedi analysis happening in real time.
All of pop culture, all of pop culture at large.
That film was particularly bad for it, you know? It was the s- like, it was hearing the kind of…
You could see the memes happening in real time with that film. You know, and hearing, like, on the walk out of the cinema, stuff which you're still hearing about now, and you're like, oh man, they never ever changed that record, did they? Uh, but I, yeah, I absolutely love that.
Blade Runner, brilliant. Weirdly, I went to see Blade Runner with Rich Stanton at the cinema, which is quite unlikely, because, you know, well, we're good friends, we didn't tend to go to the cinema that much, but we went to that, and then we went to the pub afterwards, and yeah, just geeked out about how much we liked Blade Runner. Yeah, like one of those, you know, you have one of those three hour chats where you best end up, like, repeating the film to each other, because you're feeling so sort of excitable.
Yeah, we did that, so that was fun.
That's interesting, so I was not a fan of that film when I first watched it, but on a re-watch last year or earlier this year, I completely have 180'd on it. I really, I'm really quite a big fan of it. I think that what helps on a re-watch is if you stop waiting for the decade of it all, you stop caring about the Harrison Ford of it all and just lock in on the Ryan Gosling character, then I think that it works better.
But I think I went in with the legacy sequel baggage of when's Harrison Ford gonna show up in his Primark sort of shirt and tracky bottoms for his bit while everyone else is wearing these very ornate sort of like sci-fi clothes. And yeah, on a re-watch and I think post COVID as well, there's some vibes, some flavor to it I think works a bit better now. But you liked it at the time, did you?
Yeah, yeah, I really liked it. I don't get me wrong, I still have big problems with like the third act of that film, but I think it gets so much stuff right and it is an incredibly hard plane to land. I think that you even have like an hour and a half of a decent ride in it is good enough for me.
Even with the Jalito at all, they can't really run aground. I liked it too.
Obviously, love Dunkirk this year as well. Dunkirk, the film which made us all a little bit more right wing when we came out.
Yeah, maybe a little bit. Was it the thing that the country needed after Brexit? I don't know.
Yeah, I love this too. I saw that in the, there's a beautiful old cinema in Brighton. I saw this in and it's, what a phenomenal film.
Every time there's a new note of film come around, Dunkirk just moves up a little bit in my personal rankings. It's just so good. Yeah, I love it.
Twin Peaks The Return happened this year, which is a really flawed watch. It's one of those things that I think retroactively, I think even at the time people were like, this is the best thing I've ever seen, like a singular piece of TV making. I think it certainly represents that era of the peak of prestige TV and all kinds of bullshit being greenlit that would never have been, never would have happened in the times when TV was very profitable, like the 90s and noughties.
But everyone was trying to get streaming service sign up. So it was kind of like an 18-hour movie. I would say about 10 hours of it, an incredibly tough hang.
I'm not really into the Carl MacLachlan, Dougie Jones of it all, whoever it was. That was bad. But the little bits of, there's some really good touches around it.
I did like that, the black and white episode that everyone loves. That is pretty amazing. And it's got a great finale as well.
But did that happen to you, the Twin Peaks Return Show?
No, I've only seen about four episodes of this and then binned it off because I thought it was such hard work. Yeah, fair enough. You know, I'm not the biggest David Lynch guy anyway compared to many of our peers.
Like I do struggle with a lot of it. And yeah, the Dougie Jones stuff, there was just so much stuff in it. Like, I just didn't understand.
Just the show you end up howling with laughter at because it's just so out there and weird. And just laughing at the idea of even being able to comprehend it.
Yeah, some of it has a bit of a Bored Lion Eric Andre Show vibe to it. Where you're like, but it's unintentional. And so you're just a bit, all you wonder is this intentional?
Is Lynch doing this on purpose? But yeah.
It was like a guy's face superimposed on like the moon or a shooting star quite early on.
Yeah, I think that was because the actor in question had died and they wanted to pay homage to him.
I think that's a bit right. I don't know if this is gonna be for me. That's sort of a winking moon.
Did you not like David Bowie coming back as a big kettle? That happened in this as well.
I don't know if I even made it to that. Did I imagine there being a bit like Michael Cera does like a bad Marlon Brando impression?
Correct, yes. It's a bit of a James Dean sort of thing. That did happen.
Yeah, there are so many people on the internet. Probably some of our listeners who are forged in entire personalities around this TV show. I had my big Twin Peaks phase years before this and then another one years before this.
When this came around, I'd actually already burned out a little bit on Twin Peaks. I wasn't at my peak of interest in it when it came back, but I watched it every week. Even when I was like, well, I think that was an hour of dog shit, I kept going with it.
I did think the finale was excellent, but it's a show that tries so hard not to give you the thing that you think you want as a fan, that you're a bit like, yeah, I get it. But I'm also watching Carmichael Loughlin just spitting out coffee and wearing a silly green jacket, and then it was just so all over the place. Yeah, a bit of an oddball of that one.
The idea of going from that to writing a puff piece script about Voodoo Vince, 2017 was rough, man.
Well, you put it like that, it doesn't seem like the best year ever. Get Out came out this year. Obviously, it became this enormous pop culture moment and it is a great film.
Big Little Lies happened this year, Matthew, did you watch that? The first season of that.
That was good.
That was good.
Slightly soured by crap second season.
Yeah, I never saw that because I just heard it was so bad. But the first very, very good, Jean-Marc Vallee, amazing director, obviously. Logan came out this year, one of the few good superhero movies.
John Wick Chapter 2, the best John Wick film, I would say. Wonder Woman came out this year as well, if that's not too cursed to discuss these days. This is also the year that Marvel started running aground for me.
I don't really like any of the films that came out this year. Like the Thor Ragnarok, Taika Waititi thing I wasn't into at all. But some people were just like, oh this is it man, this is the only good Marvel film.
I was just like, I can't even with these people.
Wonder Woman also gave us Demi-God with David Thewlis' stupid mustache.
That did happen, yes. I remember that being a pretty good film, I never re-watched it, but it was like a, I think it was like the best superhero film of the year anyway, Wonder Woman. But nonetheless, Matthew, that's a good pop culture year, that, and that's it really, that's all the preamble.
Pal, anything more you want to say about 2017? Are you gonna put on the record now how you diagnosed me? Is it really that explosive?
You won't share it.
No, no, I just, I just need a bit of time to come up with something good.
Oh, fair enough. Okay. I was a bit like, Oh God, did you think I'm sort of like a borderline-
No, no...
.associate parent or something?
I was doing that to get out of having to give an answer because I couldn't think of anything smart in the moment. Full disclosure. That's fair enough.
Well, you're dealing with a lot of PTSD from Voodoo Vince, I know, so like that's okay, pal, I understand.
We interviewed Phil Spencer in a London hotel and the gimmick was he was going to be playing Voodoo Vince while we interviewed him because he really liked Voodoo Vince. What a great video idea that was. We turned up to it and someone in our team, not me, had bought broken lapel mics.
I couldn't say to Microsoft, well, we can't do the video because we didn't bring equipment, because obviously that would just be not on. I had to run around London hardware stores, trying to find a place that sold lapel mics, which is quite a specialist piece of equipment. Googling where to buy lapel mic in the next half an hour.
I had to run to this shop. I ran past someone famous and in the telling, this has definitely changed over the years.
I can't remember if I ran past Julian Barrett from The Mighty Boosh or David Cross.
One of those people I've walked past on a different occasion. But anyway, ran past someone very famous while I was having one of the worst half hours of my life. Managed to find a lapel mic in a nearby shop.
Ran back, at which point I was so sweaty from running that I just couldn't even face meeting Phil Spencer because I thought I can't present myself to him when I'm literally like a water man. I'm like that guy who turns into a puddle in The X-Men. And I had to go and hide in the tiny toilet in the hotel suite to dry myself off with Towson.
Just fucking, oh, misery upon misery.
Good lord.
I'm amazed I made it through 2017, you know.
Every anecdote you've got from this year is like a Safdie Brothers skit. It's just like…
I was on it, yeah. It really, it really felt like that. After this Rock Paper Shotgun, I mean, my god, it was just like…
It's like I've been allowed into heaven.
I just remember how stressed out you were. I remember… What sucked was I remember how disillusioned you were with OXM at the last few months of that.
And then you went into this and you were like, oh no, this is much worse. I was like, oh, that's a shame that that happened. That sucks.
Yeah, but oh well.
Oh well, the games are very good from this year, as we'll discuss after this quick break.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, two top 10 lists and some honorable mentions at the end. The usual format.
Some games we would have talked about before, probably many games we would have talked about before, actually. But in some ways, I think that my honorable mentions are probably a bit more interesting than the main list. But that's okay.
I think I'm still excited to hear what you've picked, Matthew, because there's actually quite a lot of differences between what's happening in some of the genres you like and on Switch, for example, versus what is happening elsewhere, which is more where I was playing games. So, yeah, big Switch here. So excited to hear your list.
Do you want to kick off with your number two?
Yeah, I will kick off with some classic Castle bullshit. Danganronpa V3, Killing Harmony.
NB, not the Pido one.
No, very much not that one. I think this was the first one that came to PS4 and Vita. And so it had this sort of extra layer of polish and snazzy graphics that they layered on top to really kind of sort of sell the madness of it.
Talking about individual Danganronpa seems, you know, it's just very, very easy to get lost in the weeds with these, you know, if you've ever played them. It's kind of like a really obnoxious version of Ace Attorney, where a load of kids are locked in a school in a murder game, where they have to murder someone and get away with it to escape from this school. And you have to enter class trials and try and work out who committed the murder and get them accused of it.
What I really liked about this one, without spoiling the story, is that Kadaka, who writes them, is quite known for his massive twists. He tends to end the games with huge twists. They're layered with lots of interesting reveals and strange rules and weird characters along the way, but he tends to drop something big on you at the end.
I thought this game has a pretty great end of first act twist, which no one saw coming and they covered up quite well in some of the promotion, and then kind of continues that. The ending of this game, if anything, is the bit which is more divisive than the others because it's quite out there. It's quite meta in how it kind of treats the whole kind of Danganronpa project.
But yeah, I just really like this. I really liked, yeah, the big swings it took. I really like the mix of characters, good mysteries, good cases to solve.
They add in a mechanic where you could instead of just using a piece of evidence to prove a contradiction in court, which is what you always do in Danganronpa, you could kind of reverse a piece of evidence and lie about it to try and catch people out. So it had this like lying mechanic which yeah, kind of turned certain bits of it on its head as well. If I remember correctly, you could use the lying mechanic to actually kind of like jump quite a far ahead in some of the cases.
You could, they were almost like short cuts or like Easter eggs hidden in there, but they were quite hard to get your head around. You know, or you could stick with the kind of traditional clues and just try and sort of do it honestly. But yeah, you know, third game, very kind of tried and tested by this point, but yeah, a fun one.
I also met Kadaka this year. We came over to promote this. I did a bit of freelance for Games Master.
I took a day off work, went to London to interview him and we talked a little about about Mystery Crime Fiction, which is always heavenly for me. So yeah, this was a happy time even if it is about, you know, teenagers bludgeoning each other to death horribly.
This is the most boring thing to pull out of that, right? Because I'm glad you got to meet Kadaka and talk about these things. But this game still released on PS Vita in 2017?
Yeah, yeah, I guess that's where its name was made, you know? Like, Danganronpa was like a bit of a Vita success story. So it kind of made perfect sense.
But yeah, I definitely remember them pulling out all the stops and it looking quite nice on PS4 though. So I don't know if the Vita version was slightly different. But yeah, traditionally, I prefer these games handheld.
But yeah, I remember playing this for like, you know, 40 hours or something on my TV and having a great old time.
Yeah, big playing bilateral on my TV energy to that, I would say. But you know, that's just me, Matthew.
Yeah, they made a demo of the game which had like a bespoke case or a bespoke story to it so like it wouldn't spoil anything of the final game when you played it.
I like it when people do that kind of thing, you know.
Yeah, that's going all out. That's just someone who really knows what they're doing, is really confident in what they've got. And yeah, that's the energy of this game, pure confidence.
What's the best way to play these games these days, do you think Matthew? Because they are widely available on different formats. Yeah.
But I think they're on Switch as well. Would you recommend playing them on there?
I'd say Switch. Because they are largely kind of text driven, sort of cycling through dialogue boxes. I still think that's quite a nice handheld format for a game.
Maybe that's just like my Ace Attorney kind of bias rolling over. But yeah, playing them, I think you can... Yeah, all three of them are like one bundle on the Switch for like, you know, 30 quid or something.
So why not? Though they are obviously re-releasing the sequel, part two, with a new scenario, a new kind of campaign attached to it. So I'm quite curious to see how that comes together.
But three at the moment, like, I think the version they released, like that is the only version you can get. So, you know, eat it up. Eat it up.
I don't know. It's terrible. That's not gonna be a new catchphrase.
We'll sort of work ahead of 2026 on some new catchphrases for you, Matthew. We'll have one for a short list.
Yeah, that had the energy. People love it.
Yeah, that's what I mean. It's sort of like, I think it's, yeah, it's gonna take a little bit more work, but then people can vote on the best one. We'll put it on a Patreon sort of poll, like, which of these catchphrases will Matthew say at least eight times in 2026?
And then we'll roll it out, eat it up! It's no People Love It, but you know, that's okay. You can't force these things into being, you know?
Dan, maybe I'll get a new catchphrase as well. I think my only catchphrase, though, is the it's a no from me dog, which isn't even my catchphrase. I just lifted it from somewhere else.
That's got more character to it than People Love It and Eat It Up.
People Love It's great, though, because there's a sort of, like, depressing British energy to People Love It, like, a sort of unconvincing People Love It, sort of like, sort of pathetic salesman energy to it that I just think is very endearing. Okay, Matthew, my number 10 is Wolfenstein 2, The New Colossus. This is not my favorite of the machine games, first person shooters.
I would say that Indiana Jones is now my favorite of these games. The games by the studio, you know, it's a phenomenal game. We did a whole episode on it.
But I think this is an interesting game in that it gestures towards Indiana Jones a little bit. Like it's got the pretty memorable America under Nazi occupation sequence where you're going through like a, you're getting a sample of what this world looks like under Nazi rule, like what America looks like under Nazi rule. And it sort of gives you a snapshot of it.
And it sort of like, it gestures a little bit of what the open worlds in Indiana Jones are like, you know, the idea of like narrative happening around you and you just having, you know, a little bit of space to explore. It's nowhere near as wide ranging here as they do in Indie, but they're so good at the first person storytelling in all of their games that it's cool to see them do something like this and, you know, the kind of villains remain incredibly memorable. The thing I would say about this game is that when I reviewed it, I mean, they rebalanced the difficulty after launch.
It was incredibly difficult game to play. Like, I reviewed it in one day, and I played it on one of the two normal difficulty settings. And there's the bit in Congress in this, which is like just so, so hard.
But a game that's sort of got like a confrontation with like Hitler on Venus, but Hitler's sort of like spluttering, sort of like pathetic, disgusting kind of like old man, while BJ Baskowitz is wearing like a silly fake mustache, just like great stuff. Just a really kind of like bold game in terms of its storytelling and very entertaining. And I just really like, I just really like the sort of efforts to modernize these games.
What's your thought on this pick Matthew?
Yeah, I didn't include it in my list. I think the difficulty thing is what I remember more than anything. Like I'd love for this just to be the Wolfenstein game with like the Nazi that drinks the milkshake in the diner, which is just a great scene.
But what I really remember is getting really stuck in lots of rooms where just loads of enemies came at me. I think when it actually becomes a big action game, I just don't know if I really know how to play this game. Like I just never really looked into how to survive and I ended up playing it in quite a timid way.
And yeah, I definitely prefer the earlier ones. But I definitely recognize everything you say about it. I mean, this was super interesting.
I just, high highs, but like lower lows for me than the first, I think.
Yeah, I think I agree with that generally. It's definitely some step up in terms of presentation. Like it feels more, it's made just for, that generation's kind of hardware, so I think it looks a bit sharper.
But yeah, there's probably a bit more variety to the new order, which is why it was higher on my list. But yeah, I did want to still recognize this. It's just like moments from this game that are like seared into my memory, in a way that just so few games are able to do, like eight years later.
It ended up muscling out, actually, Little Nightmares from my list, because in the end, I just got it, I bored it down till I reviewed both these games for PC Gamer, which did they give a higher score, and I gave Wolfenstein II 81 percent, and I gave Little Nightmares 78 percent. So I was like, right, okay, if that's what I said at the time, that's what I believe.
Forever.
Let's just go with Wolfenstein II, yeah, that's it. So I just thought fine, Wolfenstein II goes in based on that. But yes, I'd love to hear what your number nine is, Matthew.
My number nine, also a second slice of Castle Bullshit. I've got to get it in a lower number, because this list becomes quite kind of sort of vanilla in an obvious way, as it goes on. Yeah.
The Sexy Brutale.
Higher on my list.
Oh, I was not expecting that.
Yeah, I love this game, man. I look forward to it. Not too far down.
But yes, great.
That's a pleasant surprise.
Indeed. Now for a slice of Samuel Roberts' bullshit. It's Sonic Mania.
All right, not on my list.
Shocker. So after many years of Sega gesturing at doing a proper 2D Sonic game again, they did Sonic 4, which I think everyone reviewed the first episode positively. Then when the second episode came out, they're like, no, that was shit actually and I never liked it.
Because it was like, there's a flash animation quality to that game and just a floatiness to it that wasn't really pure Sonic. Then there was Sonic Generations, which is side-on and good lord, the original Sonic Generations to play now is very unimpressive, I would say. I played the Switch 2 version of Sonic Generations, and may I shock you by saying that the Shadow, the Hedgehog content in that game is actually pretty good.
It really highlights how weak the Sonic Generations content actually is in it. It seems like a very boring version of the Sonic 3D formula zooming in on things and things being too fast, too fast for you to control, just very light on exciting set pieces. The Shadow stuff is actually way better, and I can't believe I'm saying that.
But here was a game that was unquestionably good. It was the Mega Drive look, it was the Mega Drive mechanics. It's a classic Sonic game made with this prism of nostalgia by Christian Whitehead, who was one of the people who would basically reclaimed the older Sonic games, and support them to new engines, and basically made it so you could play it on all these old games on modern formats.
It was great, it sold really well, and they never made another one, but they just keep cranking out Sonic games that are not necessarily all that. But Sonic Mania was just like, it was exactly what people wanted Sonic the Hedgehog 4 to be. It showed you a few level archetypes that you recognize, and some that you'd never seen before, and just did some really fun things with animations and cameos.
It felt like the whole of that Mega Drive, Mega CD oeuvre of Sonic games. They paid homage to it in there without it being to sort of like Silver the Hedgehog or Cream the Rabbit Coded, I would say, which was a key distinction. Really liked this game.
I only played through it for the first time a few years ago on Switch, but yeah, I just thought it was nice that they made a good Sonic game that didn't have any terrible anime cutscenes or bad VO. Thoughts Matthew?
Do you have a favourite zone?
It was Press Garden Zone, Matthew. That was the one. Do you remember that one?
The only one I remember is, isn't there one which is like a TV studio?
Yeah, that's, which one is that actually? Judyopolis Zone, I think is the one you're thinking of.
Judyopolis.
It's a very inventive name. Yeah, and then obviously there's the one we talked about before where the boss battle that is Dr. Robotnik's B&B machine. Just really fun touches.
I think the kind of Sonic game that people have just really fantasized about, but no one inside Sega seemed to want to make until this point, but I thought it was super sharp. Any thoughts?
Yeah, I mean, crazy that they haven't made like two more of these since then. Yeah. This feels like a slam dunk.
Yeah, I played this. I did like it. It definitely felt like what I remembered of the Mega Drive games.
Yeah, it just seems so obvious to continue down this line because this was, yeah, just so sort of spot on. I just, the 3D Sonic mechanics leave me so cold, like wrestling with them and wrestling with the camera and being thrown by those games. So, yeah, go back to this.
Lean in to the fandom and yeah, get it up.
People love it. This is an age of particularly stinky 3D Sonic games as well. Sonic Forces was this year, I think.
And before this had been Sonic Lost World, which I did not think was very good on the Wii U.
Which was good. The Mario Galaxy of Sonic games.
But then there was that awful Sonic Boom rise of Lyric or whatever it's called, the one that came out.
Move Over Uncharted.
Yeah. And so it just seemed like it was a bit of a, I know you did say Uncharted. You printed that and that did happen.
Yeah. So the idea of like, you know, just this other studio taking a run at Sonic and it being good. That was good.
Hey, it's 2D Sonic. There's not much more to say, but Sonic Mania. So a great dependable have it on your Switch, jump into it, sort of train journey kind of game.
So I'm a fan. What's your number 8, Matthew?
My number 8 is Hand of Fate 2.
Oh, yeah. And this definitely counts as Castle bullshit as well, I think.
Yeah. I'd say this is the last bit of certified Castle bullshit. I wish it wasn't, so I think Hand of Fate is a really underrated couple of games.
This, for people who have forgotten about Hand of Fate, which is everyone it seems, is a kind of an action role playing game where the the story or the kind of the the world you move through is built from tarot cards. You're sitting opposite this sort of games master dealer character who's dealing these cards, and like the order that the story cards get dealt to you decides the order that you encounter obstacles. Some of those things are solved with like dialogue choices or just like chooser and adventure text choices.
Some of those are literal 3D battles where you kind of go into this sort of like Arkham feeling combat system, sort of dodge rolling and countering attacks to fight people. Sometimes there are obstacles and traps you have to navigate. Is a deck builder of a sort in that while the dealer has like the story you're going to play through, you also add your own deck of cards to the mix which are like positive events which you'll encounter along the way, or items you might pick up, or something they added to the sequel, companions, so allies will then join you in battle.
So the idea is that you're trying to sort of spike his evil adventure with positive benefits which you're going to discover, and hopefully you'll discover the items early on and be able to carry them through the campaign, and then if you put like a mystic grove where you get healed by elves, you'll encounter that after a particularly nasty battle. So there is a randomised element to it, but you know that's the core idea of Hand of Fate, and this sequel is very much like a sort of bigger version of that. It just adds way more variety of events.
Each sort of story or campaign has a sort of bespoke gimmick to it which makes you kind of reconsider how you're building the deck. You know in the first game a lot of the stories were just get to the end and fight a boss, where in this one they tend to have a little kind of wrinkle to them. So like in one of the stories for example you're poisoned, so your health is constantly dropping.
So you know making a deck which is going to kind of like boost your health and lift your health up becomes extra important. You know or in another one you might have to do something you know in a limited time or a limited number of moves. So again you're just sort of thinking about what cards could I be dealt that would improve my chances of pulling off this story.
I just don't think there's anything else really like it. To take the kind of language of card games and deck builders which you know you probably have a very specific thing in your head when you hear that and turn it into this very sort of hands-on piece of like narrative world building with literally like hands-on action scenes that you play out in the middle of it. I thought it was really sad that this game didn't do good enough business for Defiant to continue.
They had Australian Studio who shut down after this game. But yeah, I think it's like a genuine hidden gem which hasn't seemed to have found, you know, any kind of popular champions. You know, I feel like this is like one Twitch stream or YouTuber away from actually kind of having a bit of a second wind.
But I will do my best for our listeners. So that's, yeah, please play it.
Yeah, it's interesting. So I think this is the year that Slay the Spire launches in early access. So you're starting to get that, you know, build up of like deck builder games and, you know, cards being used in every game, which, you know, we're still kind of living in that era a little bit, you know.
But yeah, you wonder if they just miss the boat by a tiny bit, you know, if maybe two years later it's a slightly different story, you know.
Yeah, but it isn't a card game like that, really. I suppose it has the look of one.
Yeah, I guess, but I feel like still people are still trading on that a little bit, you know, like it's still a lot of games have some kind of card layer for there to be something else underneath it. But yeah, every time you talk about it, I'm like, oh, that's, you know, super interesting. I add it to my wish list of games on psprices.com, so I get email notifications about it.
And then get pinged about it pretty much every three months and forget to buy it or play it. I may even own this somewhere at this point. But yes, always like hearing about it, Matthew.
So a good recommendation for our listeners if they're ever at a loose end. I think there is a Steam sale coming up, so can't hurt. Okay.
My number eight is Assassin's Creed Origins. Is this in your list?
It isn't.
Yeah. So I think an Assassin's Creed game shouldn't be longer than 20 hours. Sue me.
And the ones after this are incredibly long. And so I think this game is a little bit forgotten now for the simple reason that Odyssey that comes out the year after this is, I think, considered maybe the high watermark of this that or Valhalla are considered like the high watermark of this type of RPG infused Assassin's Creed experience. But this was their first attempt at it after the London set one.
I forgot the name of Matthew, Syndicate came along and I think did okay and was definitely considered critically better received than Unity, which obviously had like a load of launch problems, but ended up being pretty good once they polished it up. It's a game that's got a very impressive sort of empires to enjoy. It just sort of felt like the original formula had run its course a little bit, I think, with Syndicate.
So with Origins, they clearly looked at the success of The Witcher 3 in 2015 and thought how could we bring a bit of that to Assassin's Creed? And so marry that with Ancient Egypt as a setting, which is very bold and different, and literally exploring the origins of the Assassins with these two protagonists, a husband and a wife, just a really interesting idea. And then despite being a sprawling game, it's basically structured so you can knock through the entire story experience at about 16, 18 hours, something like that.
That's what I did with it. And then if you want to keep playing afterwards, there is tons and tons of content out there for you to play. This is my preferred structure of open world game or game that has any kind of gating to it.
So this is why I like Jedi Survivor so much, because the actual core game is quite short. But if you want to play it for 40 hours, then the game gives you the means with which to do that. And I think that's just good.
Whereas it's really obvious playing something like Assassin's Creed Shadows that you can feel the game just stretching out into the distance. And that is so just not my preferred mode of Assassin's Creed. I never think they've got enough going on mechanically to justify being as long as that.
And I felt that way playing Odyssey the year after this. But I didn't feel that way playing this. And then they did some quite interesting stuff with it.
Like they added things like a giant sort of like fight with a god in the middle of the desert and things like that. It's just massive parts of the map you'll never go to. But absolutely beautiful to look at.
And I think just really like gave Assassin's Creed a shot in the arm after it being like just maybe exiting, being like the hottest thing in gaming. Like I don't think this generation, it was ever quite as front and center in games as the way it was in the 360 generation where those games are just absolutely enormous. But I thought this was really strong at the time.
And even though I don't think the combat was like best in class as a sort of slightly dark soulsy, slightly witchery third person, kind of like a block counter sort of combat system, it's still pretty good. Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, I did like this. Maybe the idea of it suffers from the fatigue I associate with that particular era of Assassin's Creed after doing several games of launching a bird to spy on people. And the core tricks that are in Origins are pretty much the core tricks in Odyssey and Valhalla.
But I definitely hear you about the length of the thing. I remember having a really strong ending in terms of the last region you go to is quite spectacular. It's maybe like, is it where there's a new temple being built and suddenly the architecture becomes super epic and grand.
And it does actually have a sense of culmination to it, which a lot of these games don't do. And they've just got a huge landmass. It feels like this bit of a map is as good as any place to end it.
But this does have quite a stylish farewell to it. Yeah, like Bayek and is it Aya, his wife? That's right, yeah.
Yeah, nice characters. Just a change of tone of voice, really. You know, that it isn't just the exact same sort of Assassin's Templar thing going on.
It has its own vibe, its own piece of history to deal with. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, I did like it.
I just, I don't know. Having said that, I am one of those sickos who really likes Valhalla and played a lot of shadows. So, I've obviously got an appetite for the 100-hour version of this too.
But yeah, it's just decent.
Yeah, for sure. I think this was the team that had done, they always say this, but it just seems very amorphous, the whole Ubisoft teams thing because they all just work on so much stuff. But I think Black Flag was, this was that studio basically.
So I think they were probably quite well suited to being the ones who were asked to reimagine what Assassin's Creed could look like. Yeah, so I do remember it being very spectacular. The budget, it feels like it's absolutely monstrously expensive game in terms of, when it takes you to a region, it will just be so sprawling and beautiful.
And to play the necessary plot elements, because it's quite a short game, you'll only be there for a couple of hours before you move on to the next thing. And yeah, it just has so much to offer. It feels like it's got so much more world than there is game to be in that world.
But I quite like that as a sort of whistle-stop tour through all these beautiful places, but you don't have to hang around there arbitrarily. There is some level-gating in this, but it's not so egregious. You can't really get around it in some way.
So yeah, a good first run at a formula that I definitely got a bit tired of. This is not my favorite series. There's a reason we've never done an episode on Assassin's Creed, I would say.
I don't personally think it's interesting enough for that. Maybe you disagree, Matthew. I definitely know you like these games more than me, like you say.
But yes, this is probably my favorite entry in this entire series, to be honest.
Wow. This was the first one that they did the sort of educational version of as well, where you could buy the game without the gameplay or the mechanics and just walk around the world and sort of have history lessons because they were that convinced of how convincing their Egypt was. If I was in school and my teacher gave me a version of Assassin's Creed where I couldn't throw pots of flaming tar at people, I think I'd be really non-classed personally.
I don't know if that's more me. Would you have been wowed by this as a 12 year old?
I probably would have taken any sort of like... If they gave me an inch, I would have taken a yard on boring the class about video games that I'd read about in PC Gamer or whatever. So I think I probably would have been quite into it.
But you know, I think we had basically BBC Micro still when I was in school. So it's sort of like, I'm not sure we ever really got games beyond the old try and get one fat lad and two thin lads to the other end of this pond, basically. So that's a bit different.
We just had Zoombinis and I'm pretty sure there wasn't like a fuller version of Zoombinis where you assassinated them. Oh, yeah, this is educational Zoombinis. The real Zoombinis is like Mortal Kombat.
I do like this as a, it's a nice idea, but I do agree it's got a bit more of a marketing angle to it maybe than an actual practical educational, maybe that's just too cynical, maybe that's not true. Do you have to get people to have like, you know, do you have to have like 10 PS4s in the classroom to do this? Like what's the, or do you just have one and they all take it in turns?
Or is the teacher playing it? It seems like quite flawed as an idea.
Have one of them pumped out through a really weak projector, so just the image looks horrible. It's the kind of thing where you can imagine like they're being played ground rumors that, you know, we've got the educational version of Assassin's Creed, that if you do X, Y and Z, you can kill this one person. Like you can knock this guy and then a crocodile will eat him.
That one got through the cracks.
Amazing. That's so funny. Do you think Odyssey will make your top 10 for 2018?
Is that a game you like much more than Origins? Because I kind of see them as a bit of a pair, you know? They come out so close together.
No, I mean, like I said, I'm a freak who... Valhalla is the one I really like of this trio. Yeah.
But then I played that just after I've been made redundant and I don't know, I think my brain was in a weird place and just going around smashing up churches and being a total shit was where my head was at.
I met someone at a wedding recently who works for Visa, like quite senior person who works for Visa. She's someone who clearly just doesn't have people in her life who talked to her about video games. So when she found out I worked in video games, she was like, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'll come home, I'll close the door and I'll play this for like four hours.
And this is how I de-stress basically, it's just going around all these villages, killing lads or whatever. And she just reeled off like, she really likes Assassin's Creed, but she reeled off all these random games and it was just funny because you could tell this is quite a big part of their life. And then here she was just telling me about all this stuff that had happened because her husband doesn't really understand it.
And I've wondered if that's like what our listeners feel like listening to us sometimes. It's like having that person in your life who are some other people who info dump to each other about video games. Like I wish I could do because you could so clearly tell this is a new experience.
This person I've met like I love Assassin's Creed Valhalla and I've never met a person or another person I can talk to about this. And here at last is one person who will understand what this is.
Enjoy my dark shame.
Here's a dweeb I can sort of info dump on at this wedding. Anyway Matthew.
I've thrown an axe at a pretend man on the Isle of Wight and someone here will finally understand me.
Yeah, I feel seen.
I have to go to Visa every day and pretend that I haven't just done that the night before.
What's your number 7 Matthew?
My number 7 is What Remains of Edith Finch.
Higher on my list. My number 7 is The Sexy Brutale, so why don't you talk about that?
Yeah, I haven't replayed this since I first played it, so apologies if I get any of this wrong, but this is a kind of a stealth point and click game from I think they were a Guildford studio called Cavalier Games. They made this one game and then are now defunct, I think, sadly. You are in this hotel and for various story reasons are tasked with saving…
ten people are going to be killed across this one evening or one day there. You're trapped in a time loop and you have to work out how to navigate this time loop to save the people who are being bumped off. I say there's a slight stealth element in that you are trying to avoid the people to interact with them directly and there are also agents of chaos in the hotel.
You need to avoid… It's not like a Hitman or Metal Gear Solid or something. It's kind of about walking down corridors and peeping through door locks to see if you can enter an empty room and pick up some objects.
It really boils down to a big stealth puzzle where you're trying to work out how to manoeuvre around the movements of these people in the hotel in order to go in and mess up their deaths basically, prevent them from happening. Each person you save you get a skill from them which you can then use to start saving other people in the hotel. And it should be obvious from that description why it worked for me.
It's kind of got murder mystery elements, there are weird assassins, I love time loops, that sort of science fiction sort of hook to it. It's remarkably similar in tone and flavour to The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, which is a book that came out a similar time by Stuart Turton, former guest on the podcast, which I absolutely love. Which was also a sort of time loop and slightly outlandish characters in a similar kind of setting.
So yeah, this just felt like pure Castle fodder. And yeah, I just struck all the right notes really. You know, perfect combination of the very exact things I like.
But I'm surprised to hear you were as into it.
Oh, I love this game. I think that a lot of it comes down to how it looks. It looks like Final Fantasy VII crossed with like a Hideki Kamehameha game or something and like crossed with Bioshock.
It's got like just such a specific aesthetic of, yeah, like a masked kind of ball and really distinctive characters and this isometric view that just makes it look like an interior in Final Fantasy VII, you know, which I guess you hadn't played properly when you, you know, when you first played this.
I could see, yeah, when I picture my head, I could, yeah.
You can definitely peek.
Peeking through keyholes is very honeybee encoded.
Indeed. And so, yeah, but it was the fact that all of these things were happening, all these murders, deaths were happening simultaneously. And it was like, there was a sense that so much was happening at once in this, on this estate and you didn't, and it felt just so unknowable at first, like why is that person going there at this time?
Like what, what's going on there? And then gradually unpicking what all of it is was just, just really, yeah, just really, really smart and like the idea of it being a puzzle, but also a murder mystery of sorts, like a, you know, like there being just something to solve in that specific way, just really, just really great. And also I think the, you know, speaking to its looks, I mean, this year, 2017, is also when Rime comes out and Tequila Works worked on this as well.
And whatever you want to say about that studio, all their games looked fucking amazing. They were great art direction in their games. I don't think Rime is a great game personally, but it's like very distinctive looking.
Yeah.
And this is the same. It just feels like, you know, phenomenally well thought out as a world to dip into. And it was a bummer that it never really became a success.
And, you know, indeed Tequila Works IP was like all auctioned off recently. I thought it was very depressing, actually, and a very bleak sign of where things are at. Like a company like that should be allowed to exist, making interesting things like this.
But, you know, you can always get this in a steam sale for like no money. And I mean, yes, it's still one of the, my go to, oh, what's an indie game that you like? The Sexy Brutale, you know?
Right, right.
And then it takes a big swing with its narrative at the end, which you either, you might like or you might not. Some critics didn't like it at the time. I thought it was a really interesting notion.
An extremely memorable game, just really original. Like what's not to like, you know?
Yeah. The creators, well, I met one of the creators of this. I think the, it wasn't the writer.
I think there were two brothers, the Griffiths brothers.
Charles Griffiths, is it?
I met Charles Griffiths at Rezd one year and he was a former fan of NGamer. I'm not going to say that hasn't coloured my selection of it in this Game of the Year episode. These are like editorially independent of that.
But, you know, clearly a man of extraordinary good taste.
Yeah, for sure. And so, yeah, I don't know exactly what happens to those brothers, but, you know, I know we have a lot of UK game devs listening. If you know the Griffiths brothers, please give them a shout out that we love this game.
Yeah.
Yeah, so good.
I imagine they've got to be at one of those other Guildford Studios, because I think they were lion head people.
I think Charles has a credit on Two Point Campus, so I assume that he did some work on that after this. But great game, man. Sexy Brutale.
I honestly think, yeah, I don't know, but the Switch version is a bit dodgy, isn't it? I heard that, but I'm sure it's fine on other consoles, but on PC it's the wrong thing.
Yeah, I played this on Xbox and it was fine.
Yeah, PC for me. So yeah, great game. Love it.
What's your number six, Matthew?
My number six is Divinity Original Sin 2.
Not on my list.
Yeah, a game which feels hugely overshadowed by Baldur's Gate 3 now. This is what Larian made before Baldur's Gate 3 as part of their ongoing Divinity series. Not a series I know like masses about.
Obviously, I know Original Sin 1, but they've been working in their own IP universe for a long time before that. And I'm very much, you know, came to the party late or one of those terrible glory hunters who kind of got in on Larian once they started putting out these like 90% rated games. But, you know, I think there are some people who may be brought into the Divinity thing, you know, years earlier.
You know, it's quite similar to Board Escape 3 in that it's, you know, an RPG meets immersive sim in its openness and the ability to use all of its systems and your weird character abilities to basically try and problem solve any situation in any way you want. There are multiple routes to, you know, solving problems. For example, if there are characters who, you know, an important character with a piece of information who dies in the course of a battle or something, you know, you make a decision, accidentally kills them, you know, you have a character who can eat the flesh of the dead and kind of relive the memories of that character.
So that's like another way of getting information from that character. You know, that's a bit of an on-the-nose example, but that is something that happens a lot in this game. I think, like, in some ways, I kind of prefer it to Bordersgate 3.
Purely in the... The thing I struggle with it with Bordersgate is kind of the D of D of it all, because I'm not invested in that world and I don't really understand it. There's a lot of stuff in that game I was quite kind of confused by and I don't think it necessarily did an amazing job of explaining.
I think that game is like an absolute dream if you are even slightly invested in D&D and you have like a character build you want to try out and all this kind of stuff where I came to it and found it like a little bit overwhelming before I finally locked in and really enjoyed it. And I think just by dint of Divinity Original Sin 2 existing in, you know, their world, their ruleset, you know, a thing completely of their own making, I just kind of got my head around it a little bit quicker. Obviously, you know, there are many ways that it is a step back.
You know, it doesn't have the same presentation, all the dialogue and conversations, you know, it's very much driven by like scrolling text. You don't have the cinematic conversations that you have in Bordersgate 3 and because of that, it does feel like a slightly older game. But, you know, if you can get past that and kind of push through that, you know, the lore of the world is super interesting.
The characters that you play as, you know, I played as their pre-made heroes in a party and, you know, they've all got great stories, you know, it's like playing as a party of great sort of bioware companions in terms of the way their stories are threaded through the main sort of story of the general campaign. You know, by the end, it feels like everyone's gone on a real journey. I experienced this game in quite a weird way in that I played it as part of a 80 plus, let's play series on Rock Paper Shotgun.
I've never sat down and played this game by myself. I did it entirely with Ash Liguori, who was co-host on RPS. So my whole time with this game is quite odd.
And maybe like my fondness for it is tied to like playing that game with Ash and enjoying it in that way. And you know, that was, that was obviously like quite a special time. But you know, most people didn't play this as part of an ongoing Let's Play series, and they really loved it.
So I'm pretty sure that it is teescent. Yeah. And you know, I don't think it is forgotten now in the world of Baldur's Gate, but I think it still has its own sort of distinct charm to it.
Yeah.
It's interesting that you mention, you know, it being overshadowed by Baldur's Gate 3, because this game in its day was so, so huge. Like it was the PC Gamer game of the year. And then I think in the top 100, the next year, we made it number one.
And it was so unquestionably like a massive moment for the RPG. And you know, like this studio that was known for these smaller, sometimes jankier games, taking a big step up with the original, the first original sin, and then, you know, basically becoming leaders with this game. And you know, I think a lot of people followed along with your RPS playthrough quite fondly.
I think there are people in our Discord who still remember that and engage with it, Matthew. So it's nice to hear, you know, the personal element that you conflate with this.
And it's also nice to have this represented in one of our lists because it was such a huge moment and it was a stepping stone to, you know, Baldur's Gate 3 is the defining RPG of this the last 10 years, isn't it? It's always meant to play this but never did. And there are such mountains to climb in these games, aren't they?
Look on how long to beat and then you talk yourself out of them quite easily.
But yeah, this is like easily a 100 hour game, you know, like that. And I don't think there is a version of it where you can rush through it. Like, I'd say one of the weird dings against Original Sin 2 is that it is super difficult, and I feel like if you're underleveled, you're at a huge disadvantage.
And as a result, like, that almost becomes like a linear route through the game, because because of the level, you know, certain enemies are certain levels, you basically it felt feels like it kind of forces you to do things in a certain order, just so you can like level up in the right order to tackle requests, if that makes sense. So it doesn't ever feel like here's a world, like go and do anything you want. It feels like here's a world, and you have to be quite careful to survive in it, which I don't think Borders Gate 3 does have that problem.
I think that's, you know, if you're in a map, it feels like, well, most stuff here is sort of for a party, roughly of this level. So this is going to work. But yeah, that's something they ironed out from Original Sin.
Interesting. All right. Well, you know, I don't think that game's even really come up in an extended form before.
So it's nice to hear, you know, like what I imagine is a big game for some of our listeners actually discussed in some way in this. I do remember this being like a big, everyone talking about the opening area of this game and how long they spent in this area. And that being like a cornerstone of discourse and people being like, this is the game itself in some ways, you know?
Yeah, I mean, because that was the area that was in early access for like, whatever, two years.
Yeah.
So that's the space everyone's in. Everyone really gets used to it. Everyone has quite a strange relationship with it.
They've seen all the iterations of it. They've seen it grow over time. And it was same in when Borders Gate 3 came out.
You know, it felt like, well, I just want to rush through this first area because we've all been here for a couple of years. And I just want to see what happens next in the story. But yeah, Fort Joy was the area in Original Sin 2.
And I mean, now Let's Play, like, you know, a fucking third of that thing was in this because it took us so long to like, work out how to play the game. Quite frustrating Let's Play.
Great stuff. Well, that is still available on YouTube. You want to go watch it.
But to my number six, Matthew is Prey. Perennial draft winner. I think it's like the hero of the sub 80 Metacritic draft.
That's quiet, man.
Oh, fuck's sake. The Metacritic. You perverted the Metacritic game.
You ruined it on episode one. And now there's no way back for the Metacritic game. It needs extensive retooling to even survive as a podcast format.
I hope you're proud of yourself, Matthew. You did win, so I guess, you know, fair enough. Yeah, so The Glu Gun, you know, a big spaceship to sort of explore, immersive sim mechanics, you know, kind of goo monsters taking over everyday objects around the space station, cool side quests to do, outdoor space bits.
I mean, just a really like cool game, very different mode for, you know, for arcane from Dishonored, which is very much that kind of like, you know, mega precise rapid movement heavy sort of like stealth game. This is very much a bit more of a, it depends on how you want to play. Obviously it is an immersive sim, but in the way I played, it was certainly more of a tanky kind of combat game, aggressive tanky combat game, you know, sort of like a good thwacking with what is it you got in this?
Is it like a fucking, what is it? Like what's the term for it? The metal thing you use to repair things.
You can tell we've been broadcasting. Wrench? Yeah, there's good like wrench thwacking in this.
And like it's just a very cool game to discover. Everyone talks about how they bought it for like, I don't know, five quid in a sale, went and played it and then I can't believe how amazing this was. It's like fondly remembered.
The DLC is pretty good as well. The more sort of like a roguelike moon crash. But the base game I just loved.
What I sort of loved more than anything else, I think was the way it looked. Just, you know, this kind of art deco spaceship design. A lot of what people wanted from a kind of like a system shock follow up, you know, those were in these similar sort of like sci-fi mode of environment.
But yeah, really love this game. We've talked about before the podcast, plenty of Matthew thoughts.
Yeah, I love it for all the same reasons. I think the only reason it maybe doesn't make it into the top tier for me of this year or maybe of like arcane games is I just don't find the enemies as interesting to fight outside of the mimics.
I think I agree with that.
But that is like the criticism of prey. If people have one, that tends to be it. But yeah, the completeness of that world, the fact that like every life on that spaceship is accountable for in some way or other, you can find out the fate of everyone who was there, and that they thought out that level of detail.
It's just brilliant, and one of the like great openings of that generation as well.
Oh yeah.
Maybe not quite like Bioshock, you know, wow, but just under it I'd say.
But yeah, arguably sort of better in the sense that everyone would have told you about the Bioshock one, but I don't think everyone would have told you about the opening to this game. And so if you get to discover it, you know, sight unseen, then it's an amazing, amazing thing to experience, so yeah, really good. Great stuff.
Okay, Matthew, what is your number five?
Yakuza 0.
Higher on my list. We're finally getting some more cross over here as we exit the bullshit phases of the list. The bullshit side.
And enter the broadly acknowledged classics of the time. Speaking of which, what remains of Edith Finch is my number five, Matthew. Maybe you want to talk on this one.
Yeah, I think coming into this, it had been pictured as like narrative experience. Some people had thrown around the walking sim term, which was obviously very popular at the time. Also derided by some, it was sort of code word for sort of thinky but maybe slightly boring game.
What I loved about Edith Finch is it has all the strengths that you d'associate with a walking sim in terms of stepping into an amazing environment. You're returning to your family's very weird mansion and exploring it and discovering the lives of the people in it through the rooms they lived in. A lot of them have bedrooms that are very tailored to their personalities.
But I think what may be like elevated it from a sort of simple kind of meditative trek through an environment was that as you go into the rooms of this family, you discover that they've all died in very unusual ways. And I can't remember the actual, what's the actual mechanic that triggers the flashbacks themselves? Does this happen?
You go into the different rooms of the people in the house, right? And then their story plays out.
Do you interact with something that then takes you in that? I can't, that's the bit I can't remember.
Oh, I can't remember either, actually. Like, does the world around you sort of just turn into the...
Maybe. Something like that. You enter these sort of self-contained vignettes which capture the moment a character died.
But each one, you know, it's like a different genre of game or a very specific interaction. You know, some of them have got different art styles and they kind of capture the way these different members of the family kind of perceive the world. Some of them are very sort of poetic and beautiful and abstract.
Some of them are just quite a sort of short, sharp shock. Quite darkly funny. My favourite description of this game was some wag on Twitter described it as narrative wario-ware, which always made me laugh.
But the idea of like, here's a five second microgame that's going to kind of show how this guy died. And here's another one showing how that character died. And they really sort of run the gamut of being, you know, quite profound little moments that capture a kind of, you know, descent into madness or, or some, you know, epic death someone had, you know, right down to just almost like the comedy splat of like a stupid accident.
And it keeps you guessing like you will absolutely want to see what happened to this family. And yeah, just tick so many boxes in terms of like execution and variety of art and ideas and, you know, the way it tells its narrative, the pacing, that kind of mystery hook of what happened to everyone. It exists in this slightly like, you know, sort of unreal world.
Like it isn't like a very down to earth, sort of gone homer like, you know, it's almost like the house is like a little bit Tim Burton-y maybe. It's still a little bit outlandish and out there. And yeah, I just thought it was great.
Like it's really magic this and, you know, it's most famous sequences. I feel like there's still like an honor code and a, you know, code of silence around some of the spoilers in this. But yeah, yeah, I agree with you.
I was discovering definitely.
I looked it up in the background. I just found two of them, but they were both diary entries that turn into like they're sort of, you pick them up as pieces of paper in the world and then they turn into like, like a screen before a transition screen into the actual sequences. So there is elegantly done in terms of how they're loaded in, but that's, that's the mechanic there.
Yeah, I agree with you. And even just like from a scrolling through there, I mean, there was huge chunks that I forgot. And I remember just it being this like, the shock of it was just how many ideas it had in terms of narrative presentation, but also just how like the, those sequences would look and what you would be doing in them.
And it just being like, wow, I just cannot believe how generous this is because most of these, you know, like walking simulators, quote unquote, were, and this is even still true of like Still Wakes the Deep, which is sort of like, takes one step into horror games. But, you know, is, is, is, this is still true of it in that they, they normally have like one thing that you're doing or one world that you're interacting with and it's about how you go through that world. That's true of like Firewatch, it's true of Dear Esther and like I say, it's true of Still Wakes the Deep as well.
It's like, whereas this is a game that's kind of like, we're taking many different shots and telling you many different stories within this one meta story and that's why it salts the earth for all walking simulators after this. This is why nothing could ever grow again, Matthew. It was so ambitious and amazing to discover, like a proper mystery box of a game that delights you, it saddens you, it really just does so much.
I think this studio still exists, Giant Sparrow, they are making something else. There was an interview with them last year, I think on Washington Post or some website like that, maybe it's the New York Times. And they're still making something, but it's been, you know, eight years in the making.
Like it's hard to follow up a game like this. It just feels so, well, that's your masterpiece, you know? Like how on earth would you follow this up?
It's a huge jump from The Unfinished Swarm, which was an interesting, what I would describe as a PS3, PSN Curio, really, you know, this is like the real deal. So, yeah, I love it. And again, it's another game from this year that would be, you know, right at the top of, you know, if I had to make a list of indie games for someone to check out, who, you know, hadn't played a game in 20 years, it would absolutely be on there.
So, good stuff, Matthew. What's your number four?
My number four is Persona 5.
Higher on my list, but it's number three. So, shall we talk about it now?
Yeah, why not? Yeah, yeah. I wrote the most stylish game ever, question mark, in my notes.
Very perceptive.
I think so. Yeah, I love Persona 5.
For the same reason I love most Persona games or the ones that I've played, the particular escape fantasy of being able to step into a world and that world being cool teenagers in Tokyo and going to highly stylized versions of things that you've maybe been to in real life or you've seen in like anime or manga and you're getting to explore those places as these cool characters who leave this incredibly sexy double life as thieves who break into people's subconsciouses to sort of steal the guilty thoughts from them to expose them to the world and you know these have always been outrageously stylish games but I think the whole you know phantom thieves thing they have in this the whole kind of heist energy you know it adds like a bit of you know whatever Ocean's Eleven I guess into the mix and I think that just really supercharges it I think if this game was like 20% shorter across the board like if it just cut out some of the repetition and the quite slow intro to it it's quite handholdy and almost like it lacks sort of any faith in you for about 20 hours I think if you could trim it down you know I think this would this would be like up there is one of my like all-time favorites and like an all-time great thing as it is like it's it's a thing which I think is incredibly cool but I I there are times where I think this has such like energy to it why is it so sort of slow in its in its like bones that doesn't quite make sense to me but putting that aside unbelievably good what a soundtrack whenever we talk about it on the episode on an episode and then I decide to use a bit of persona music in like the in the ad break or whatever it always sends me down a rabbit hole of like well now I have to listen to these ten other tracks it's just so cool when you listen to that music you just imagine yourself as a cooler self well I do anyway you know and you think oh yeah this is you know it's all within our grasp we all have to become Phantom Thieves yeah and then it closes YouTube and goes back to editing the podcast and pretend we're not the not the perverts whose mind palace is being infiltrated by the Phantom Thieves that's a very important distinction to make yeah yeah I mean an amazing game to discover at the time I knew what persona was I played the PSP once and the PS Vita Golden a little bit as well and I I kind of knew I always found that life sim RPG hybrid element you know sort of idea that core idea enticing but there are just such obvious limitations to persona 3 and 4 in terms of the dungeons are just not very interesting and this game is all about sugar coating all of the things that were holding persona back from like absolute greatness and making the Mayan palace is these very distinct kind of environments you know sort of dungeons for you to unpick you know it does have lots of repetitive dungeon bullshit as well as you're going around and fucking with Morgana in the underground below Tokyo listening to that dreary music and fighting lads down there that's like a little bus that's quite fun yeah yes it's alright that was the bit when my girlfriend would always hand the pad to me she would be like oh yeah you do these bits it's like a stretch of mementos yeah it feels like I'm logging on for a shift you know what I mean that's doing my shift down in mementos the execution was so good because it was such a long wait for them to make this game and it's not like they yeah it's not like they're ever like that widely available percent of all golden was stuck on Vita for years so it was very much whispered about as like if you have a Vita you can play this amazing RPG and so yeah when it finally comes along and it finally makes it over here just absolutely unbelievable to discover just very well-rounded characters just so much so much going on in all of their their different lives such beautiful little environments to take takes you to these little you know pockets of Tokyo that just feel so feel true to life but like you say there is an aspirational quality to what if I was a teenager living here what if I had all these cool friends and what if we were outsiders but we were also like superheroes basically yeah just just wonderful and I would not I would find this so intimidating to follow up if I was them and you know it I guess like the proof of that is that it's probably going to be a decade you know between this game and the next Persona game which is why do they waste time on full metaphor refantasmia whoever talks about that game now have you heard one thing about that in the last six months Phil Savage really likes that game he was but like I did I think guess it came up because I talked about it as a well that was kind of a no one really like I have any footprint at all I couldn't name a cat a single character from that game persona five just hung around in the yeah yeah the conscious fucking cool yeah it is and it's sort of that thing of like do the devs definitely understand what it is that people really like about this game and it's hard to replicate because if you are if you are them where do you set the next persona game because for is countryside five is city they're always set in Japan like where do you go do you just international student in bath baby paying an absolutely obscene fee to Barth University that's what the motivation is what I've got to raise 100 grand in tuition fees fuck I better rob the Nat West. Yeah, just like, oh yeah, just taking my dates to the spa, rooftop spa and then just be like absolutely bankrupt and then you get chucked out of your student accommodation after year one, you have to move into a flat with like eight other people. Great stuff Matthew.
Then you're like out there ruining it for everyone else in Sainsbury's on freshers week because they've all got to get their shopping. But as your tweet said, buying their last vegetable of the year before they just eat McDonald's for a year. I mean, there's so much material here for bath persona.
It feels like a waste to have it in the middle of like two hours and a half into a list feature podcast.
But that's a gift to people who stuck with it.
Absolutely. I love that. Oh, damn.
There's more to be done here. There's more work to be done with persona set and bath. But yeah, maybe you just say that if you pick a different city like Osaka or whatever, it has a different vibe automatically because the city is so different.
But I mean, I don't know if anything will ever feel like the leap from four to five again. Just that presentational upscaling, just pretty amazing really. So yeah, never finished this.
I got right near the end and then I broke up my girlfriend, we were staying past the pad with and then the save got lost on a PS4 somewhere. So, oh, God, that's something for me to do at some point is to go back and it's not good. One of the many bad things that happened during COVID, but alas, this is all getting a bit deranged this deep into the podcast.
My number four is Yakuza 0, Matthew. We talked about it loads before, but it is a phenomenal game. This came out pretty late.
It was 2015 released in Japan and finally brought here. It was a series that I think they're even wondering, should they even bother with the West? And then slowly but surely, the OGs were out there keeping the series alive on PS3, buying Yakuza 5 and the eight people who were buying that and telling everyone it was good, they were doing God's work.
And then I think with Yakuza 0, they were able to get a foothold again with this series. That is pretty much a RPG brawler hybrid. I don't really want to say it's an open-world game, but you are going around a fictional bit of Tokyo Kamurocho set in the 80s, so it's a prequel to the other games.
And it's just a ton of fun because the story feels quite lightweight. It's basically like a gang war and you are hanging out with your best pal going to bars and beating money out of people, kicking the shit out of them in streets, trying to avoid Mr. Shakedown who's going to steal your money. Mr. Shakedown, all-timer, back page pod, supporting character, Mr. Shakedown, love that guy.
But this game is, the magic of it is in, well firstly, the old man faces that we talked about many times in this podcast, but also the side quests that are just so low budget, but have so much character in the writing and the presentation. And just the little bits of the game developers putting themselves in it. You know, really, really fun stuff.
It's just so, so good that once you've played it, it's actually a slightly rickety journey through Yakuza Kiwami after this. It's not nearly as good, but 0 is amazing and definitely like jumpstarted the series again. And now we get one every year, Matthew.
Thoughts?
Yeah, I mean, I'm very happy that we get one a year, that they've largely kept up the quality of this. Yeah, it's just a really fun one. Great characters, great villains in this as well.
I really like the secondary antagonists, like the second tier of like kind of wrinkly faced old men who turn out to be incredibly hench that you have fights with. Is it Kuze?
Yeah, I fucking love Kuze.
Just like all-timer old man faces in this game, particularly this iteration. Yeah, playing as Majima, causing chaos in Sotenbori, also excellent. His introduction to the game, his like arrival as a sort of nightclub host is just one of the best intros of a character in any game ever.
Yeah, it's absolutely brilliant, this one.
It's a controversial to find Majima in all the other games a tough hang and to prefer the very serious version of him that's presented in this game because what a great character, you know?
I kind of go with that. Certainly when he keeps like jumping out of bins and stuff in KoAmi, that's tough. The endless, where is Majima anywhere or whatever it's called, that bit of the game.
Yes, showing that basically, jumping out of you. That's tough. It's a real like a real downgrade to go from this quite dignified nightclub owner in this who's trying to like hold on to his little bit, his little corner of the world to an idiot jumping out of a bin in the next game.
That's an all time drop off, my friend.
Yeah, I mean it comes for us all.
Indeed it does. We're definitely in our jumping out of the bin phase. We're approaching it.
Yeah, for sure.
We're ironing out the bin thinking, that wouldn't be so bad.
Okay, Yakuza 0 we discussed plenty before I think, so we can move on from there Matthew. But I agree, Kuze, all time of a rare face. I definitely think that there's a future where I could be Barth's Mr. Shakedown.
I'm not ruling that out as where I'm going. Maybe I'll have a flatten ship in him or something, and then I'll just come into Barth, commute into Barth to be Mr. Shakedown and steal money from people.
The thing is I don't really carry much money on me ever, so I would never have a money counter above my head, but you could probably have a shopping list of sandwiches I've got on me at any given time.
That's good. I'd actually go around with one of those.
Mr. Shakedown's just been to Pret, and he's got three chicken baguettes.
Well, that's a good route, but I was also thinking about going around with one of those card readers, and you just have to do a quick contact list, like I just need you to put 20 quid on this before I beat you up, and then I take it, and then I'll be easy to track down for the police, but lucrative potentially. Anyway, time to move on. What's your number three, Matthew?
My number three, it's a revival of the Castle bullshit. It's Xenoblade Chronicles 2.
I thought you were about to go, it's a me, marry. He didn't say it, so I was completely thrown off. Please continue.
Yes. Given the quality of what we're talking about in this top five in 2017, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is probably like the messiest game here. It's incredibly uneven.
There's lots of stuff which is very, very irritating about it. It's obviously a continuation of the Xenoblade series, which started on the Wii. Its big hook is that you're exploring worlds on the back of titans.
In Xenoblade 1, that was two giant titans who had sort of locked in eternal battle. In this, the different land masses are on all kinds of different creatures. And one of the big wow factors is seeing each new environment, each area.
They're so big, there's so much to explore, but they also have these like really outlandish ideas. Here's an archipelago set on the backs of jellyfish, here's a multi-layered ice canyon on the back of a whale or something. You know, there's all these different places and beautifully scored, like an all-timer soundtrack.
Really, the length of this game is just to justify listening to like a hundred hours of this particular soundtrack. The world themes are so good, the battle themes are so good. The kind of more uneven element of it is that there's this sort of half your party is made up with like named companions, but everyone's armed with these like living weapons, which you draw from like sort of gatcha pulls.
You know, there's no microtransactions or anything like that, but it's just a little bit of a weird system where you end up investing a lot of time pulling all this like generic shit, hoping for these named characters. And then the actual kind of quality of those characters designs varies massively from quite cool to sort of slightly obscene and unpleasant and...
I've seen it. I've seen the one.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's some of them where you're like, I just don't think you've seen a human woman.
Like, I don't think you understand like how the body works because that ain't it. But, you know, if you can get around some wonkiness with that and maybe some problems with it does a horrible job of explaining its battle system, which is quite good if you watch some YouTube videos actually explaining it. I think you can just enjoy this epic world, epic quest, epic soundtrack, really fun anime story with big twists and turns, big melodrama.
Every character gets their little moment, some big villains, some big reveals. I just think this is like a kind of really like maximalist version of Xenoblade 1, which in itself was already quite, you know, grand and over the top. But, you know, for Nintendo fans who may be, for later Nintendo fans who maybe didn't get in on the kind of classic JRPGs when they were happening on like PlayStation 1, you know, don't have that Final Fantasy connection.
I do really rate this as like a, you know, a world and a set of characters you can kind of really fall in love with and feel that kind of ownership for. It's the JRPG series that means the most to me. And this is like the big weird one that some people hate.
But I think some people will just think it's like the best thing they've ever played. So number three it goes.
This is one of my favorite sort of like sub-strands of your Nintendo fandom, I think. Just because, you know, like you say, you have taken quite a specific journey into it in terms of your consumption of other JRPGs. And so you're now sort of reverse engineering the rest of the genre from what you've played here really.
And so I like that. I like that perspective.
I play Final Fantasy VII and I'm like, oh, that's so Morag from Xenoblade 2.
That's so Morag. My favorite Nickelodeon show back in the day. Yeah, so I think I did always intend to play the definitive edition of this and then it's just such a mountain to climb.
But I feel like every listener who has taken your advice and played these has had a really good time with them. And so, you know, a journey well worth taking, you know?
Yeah, and this is the one, this only has its Switch original version. Like, you know, if they do go back and revisit it, I don't know. I'd rather they got on with like Xenoblade 4 the next game rather than making like an all singing, all dancing version of Xenoblade 2.
But it's like technically the roughest one on Switch by far. It's kind of unpleasant to look at in handheld mode. And it's not like Switch 2 does anything for it.
So it's a bit of a bummer. Like it's it feels like quite an early Switch game. You think how on earth did they turn this around like two years after Xenoblade Chronicles X?
And I think the look of it is maybe the answer.
Yeah, bit of a disguise of it. OK, well, you know, interesting, but clearly still a game that means a lot to you. I do like the idea of the gacha thing.
That's like a cool. I don't think I've ever encountered anything like that in other games. I mean, I guess, unless you count like, you know, the the hoover games where there is an element of that.
But that's obviously like a microtransaction game. It's just so different here in its implementation.
You know, imagine Final Fantasy 7 where you just don't meet Wedge because you didn't pull them.
You don't. Sounds like a good time, to be honest. I'm not a huge Wedge guy myself.
I'd be gut to miss out on Jesse, though, you know, or a version of Final Fantasy 7, which is only wedges.
Because you got unlucky.
I quite like that concert, actually. A version of Final Fantasy 7 where, like, you never get Aerith, so, like, there's a very dramatic sequence where Wedge is, like, killed, and you're like, oh no.
And another Wedge is upset.
That's it. Fortunately, I've got several other Wedges from before.
I like the idea of Sephiroth. It's just got, like, five Wedges along that massive sword. You're like, oh my god, I can't believe that sword was five Wedges long.
It's OK. I'll just, you know, I'll draw another one. And, oh, fortunately, I've got three more Wedges.
So that's it's fine. I've got infinite supply here. OK, well, lots to think about there.
And more and more deranged, the podcast becomes an hour three. My number three was Persona 5, Matthew. So I'm afraid you have to keep talking for your number two.
I wonder what it's going to be. What a question mark that is for me to consider. But yes, what's your number two?
My number two is Super Mario Odyssey.
It's a me, Mario Odyssey.
Yes.
Brackets Super Mario Odyssey.
Yes.
Okay, very good.
Brackets Switch 2017.
Indeed. So talk on it.
Yeah. I mean, I've talked a lot about Super Mario Odyssey. A game I would say now I'm like more assured of its greatness than ever, having just played Donkey Kong Bonanza, which I absolutely love, but I don't think is Super Mario Odyssey.
Quality-wise. What I love about Super Mario Odyssey, it's basically EAD Tokyo quietly prototype 20 new characters in terms of different things you can possess and take over and enjoy their unique movesets, while also giving you Mario himself in one of his more exploration-friendly adventures. So, giving that more open-level style of Mario an airing which it hadn't had in the Galaxy games and 3D Landon world, which are a bit more linear in their design.
I'm not sure that that scale is the best bit of Mario Odyssey for me. I think it's best used in conjunction with the possessions which give you crazy movement like galloping across the sands in the desert level, or those little kind of watery jetpack things that let you sort of fly around like the seaside level. Like that's…
The scale is more like a big playpen for bigger feeling characters. I think the actual act of sort of quietly exploring and excavating, you know, endless moons across them, it isn't necessarily like my favourite mode of Mario. You know, I do prefer the Galaxy model.
But, you know, just a crazy amount of invention in this. So much love for the series, like a huge celebration of all those years of Mario. It has all these little hidden bonus rooms.
It has the 2D levels where you sort of flatten yourself against the wall and play a weird little bit of retro Mario. It has all those possessions, like I say. Just the levels are quite weird.
There's like a real kind of sort of funkiness to the Tokyo. Lots of thinking in this. It's just quite an out there, quite a surreal game, which can have like a cooking level where everything looks like it's made out of crystal.
And then all of a sudden you're in like a sort of lightning arena that looks a bit like a sort of Dark Souls dungeon. And, you know, then you're jumping around on the moon. And to top it all off, you get to the end of the game completely exhausted with all the ideas.
And then it reveals that there's this sort of second layer of challenges that unlock and sort of refresh every level. So then you go back in and you start exploring again, having more fun. It's just it's incredibly generous.
I love its end game. I think that is what separates it from Bonanza. Like I think it just it really sort of it has such a clear idea of itself and just knows how to kind of spin more of that out.
Great music, great times. Love going in that fizzy ocean, feeling the fizz in the in the HD rumble. That's delightful.
It's just absolutely brilliant. And I can't wait to play another 3D Mario in about five years.
I think you should ditch Eat It Up and go with Feeling the Fizz instead. I think that's like a...
Feeling the Fizz.
Yeah. I think that's got more mileage in it to be honest.
Yeah. I like it.
Yeah. A game I've like dabbled with, it's not my top 10 but I've not played properly. I just couldn't convincingly put it in my top 10.
It's not a comment on the quality of it, obviously.
We got to do something about this at some point. There's definitely an episode in like You Properly Play Odyssey. Yeah.
I mean, it might be a good follow on from the Galaxy episode we're going to do in November, right? So maybe this is something we do early next year. I mean, I will say that playing through Bonanza gave me the appetite to play through this.
I was like, well, I got to go and see. And I've seen what three great ideas and then two slightly wonky ideas look like in this. I want to see loads of banger ideas back to back.
Explored perhaps not quite as comprehensively, but the array of them is very impressive. I probably did about 10 percent of this. I never got to New Donk City, for example.
Oh, man. You didn't even get to New Donk City.
I know. So there's a lot I've not experienced there. I don't remember why I didn't at the time.
It was a very busy first year on Switch, you know? Like you just had Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. That was like my first huge Nintendo Switch thing.
And then I had this and then it just got swept aside.
But I can't believe you didn't make it to the Donk. You're basically Adrian Brody on the boat at the start of The Brutalist, having a terrible trip. That's what you need to arrive at New Donk City.
I was not expecting The Brutalist to come up.
Only the classic shot of the inverted Donkey Kong.
Oh dear, I love this. The Brutalist, Vyma. I mean, I definitely don't have any more jokes to add to this.
It's too specific and then too many horrible things. Like, who's Guy Pearce in this situation? Like, what's the...
It's probably one of the broodals, those evil rabbits.
It's probably one of the broodals. And on that note, we simply move on. It's probably one of the broodals.
Well, I'm feeling the fears for my number two, which is Nier Automata.
What a hard shift into that, yeah.
I mean, Yoko Taro had a dream. What if I could make my players sad and horny at the same time? And then execute it on that dream to an extremely high level with Platinum Games in tow.
So, again, another game that's been talked about many times. I think I picked it in the All-Star Japanese Game Developer Draft. Didn't win that.
Lost by one vote, by the way. Gutted, obviously. But I will have my revenge in November for the next draft, which I don't know what it's going to be yet, but I'll start that email chain with Ash and Dave shortly, Matthew.
So, yes, a game you have to play through many times. You are an Android trying to clear out Earth in conjunction with other Androids because it's been run amok with all these sort of crazy robots, basically evil robots, except that's not exactly what is going on. The layers of the sci-fi story are peeled back bit by bit, but there is a very specific haunting atmosphere to this extremely budget-looking open world, helped by the fact that the characters all look phenomenal because they have been designed by Akihiko Yoshida, who you'll know as the artist behind Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy XII, Vagrant Story.
I might be wrong about Tactics, actually, but definitely those other two. And, yeah, just a game that you have to complete multiple times to see all of, but, you know, 2017, this specific context in which it was released was, I didn't think this was going to be anything. I was like, why have they made a sequel to this game that I didn't even think was good?
You know, I was, we've talked about this before, we were both a bit down on the original Nier, you know, definitely didn't rate it as a combat game. Singular, certainly, but just a really like a rough first draft feel of a game. This comes along, the combat is definitely not Platinum Games Best, but it is still absolutely robust, as you can expect from all of their combat games.
But it just has, you know, I think it just reached, it just, it picked the right moments to find an audience that appreciated what it was going for. I think part of that is the rise of just sort of like Japanese media in the West, and particularly the US, and appetite for anime and more complex anime, and that just the world it released in compared to the original Nier was just so, so different. And so people were bang up for this and it became like an instant cult classic.
But then, you know, much to my surprise and the surprise of everyone also became like a massive commercial success. You know, I think this is sold better than any of the recent Final Fantasy games. You know, it was, it seemed like a real underdog to me, but really became so huge is widely available on all these different formats.
And yeah, you know, it's an, it's an, it's an old timer. It's, you know, there's so many moments in this game are just absolutely burned into my memory. And it's, it's a wonderful thing to discover and incredibly influential as we talked about before.
Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I kind of wrestled with this one. Like it very almost made the top 10. I think maybe like a few too many things that sort of frustrate me, like moment to moment, like some of the side quests aren't like all that.
And there's, there's a fair amount of like, just go and collect X number of this in this desert area or whatever. And it's that stuff which kind of grinds me down a little bit. But yeah, when it hits the highs and it gives you like an amazing piece of music or a mad boss or, you know, you understand and see what's going on with the structure of the game.
Those are, those are amazing moments. I don't know. I probably should have put this in, but at the same time, I just, you know, I wanted to celebrate my precious hand of fate and whatnot.
So, yeah, that's tough. It's tough here, you know.
Well, it's okay because I think that, you know, you can take it as red to a large extent, what the best, the absolute best games of this year are.
Yeah.
And so, yeah, I think I definitely tried to pick a few things I had talked about quite as much, but the top five are completely copped to being quite predictable. But man, Nier Automata is amazing if you've never played it. Definitely go discover it.
So we come to the number one, Matthew, which is going to be my number one as well. Take it away.
Yes, Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild, which we've talked about a million times on this podcast. There are so many ways it's absolutely amazing. I think in the context of this episode, and talking about 2017 being a slightly harder year, I really cannot understate, overstate, whichever one it is, that, like, sort of, just how much of a kind of sort of bomb this game was when it arrived.
Like, you know, we often talk about games having, like, good vibes and positive vibes, but just being able to sort of step into this world, which was so, not relaxing, just makes it sound like it's a bit too passive, but I just felt so, like, refreshed by it, you know, it has such a sort of sense of, like, nature and the wind and the music and the sort of simplicity of life in that world. And yes, there's big adventures to go and be had, but, you know, also you can just be in the woods or climb a mountain and do all this, that and the other. And I just, you know, I really needed something like that.
It wasn't just like a distraction. It was, you know, just something that was just like a wholly positive experience. And the last time I've experienced that kind of, like, you know, generational shift in something, or that sense of, oh, this is, you know, this is a masterpiece.
This is the stuff. This is something I've never played before. That, you know, you're just gripped with that excitement at how good something is and just how well it's landing.
And, you know, you're excited about telling people about it. You know, when I was reviewing the game, I just couldn't wait to tell people how good this thing was. You know, you're excited to see what's happening next.
You know, you never want it to finish. You just, you know, you're trying to kind of stretch it out as much as you can. You know, those games are quite rare.
You know, like it's up there with, like, playing Mario 64 for the first time and just being like, well, that's everything changed for me then, you know, game wise. You know, yes, with that comes like the removal of some, like, classic Zelda tropes and some classic Zelda structure, but I would say like 100% worth it for that, that positive effect, which I know is a wishy washy way of talking about it. But, you know, that is, that is how it, how it worked for me in 2017.
You know, it was just like, oh, this is great. You know, all is, all is well again.
Yeah, it was an absolute delight to discover. It was a game that I played at E3, Ashley Day, smuggled me into the Nintendo area and I was on PC Gamer. And I played through the opening tutorial bit and then saw like a, like a boulder roll down a hill and club a bunch of goblin lads out of the way.
And I was like, yep, this has got proper physics in it. It's reactive, it's, it's exciting. The visual style is incredibly well considered and it's fun to play.
Just great stuff. And then the game came out and it did turn every single time you turned it on into like an amazing adventure, absolutely absorbing. Like it's, it's that one of the last times I felt the thing of like, I just want to go over the horizon to see what they've built there.
Like, rather than being like, I have to explore this as a matter of course to progress the game. This was like, I want to see what's in that volcanic bit. I want to see what's the, what the designers of this game have put in the desert.
I want to just, the specific way they built the open world in this game is all about eliciting joy and discovery and not just functioning in the way that an open world needs to. It's like, the exploration itself is the joy of it. And it's part of the reason why I think I didn't get on with Tears of the Kingdom as much is because you know the world and therefore it can't necessarily give you that, even in a remixed form the second time around.
And that was the thing I loved the most about this, but-
There's a big hole under the world, Samuel.
Yeah, I've still never been there, which I'm sure is very annoying to hear. I played for 24 hours and never-
Evil.
Evil is such an hour three thing to say to me. You whispering evil to me. I just wasn't feeling the fizz to go down there, Matthew.
The fizz is in the hole.
The fizz is in the hole. That sounds like something you read on a note in Silent Hill 2. Okay.
So yeah, but great game. And loved even like the wacky, I mean, I played on Wii U initially, the wacky sort of like physicsy stuff you would do with the Wii U gamepad. I was like, man, they're really going for it with this game.
It's kind of an everything feeling game. Still big chunks of side quests I never did. Never did the little prefab town side quest properly, only if I really wandered into that and said hello to a bunch of people.
Never did the actual quest bit of that.
Tarry Town. My little brother named his cat Hudson after the builders in this.
Yeah. Well, if Tarry Town was a bit of Somerset, what would it be, Matthew? Is Tarry Town like Bradford-on-Avon or probably Trowbridge, actually?
Is Tarry Town Trowbridge?
I mean, it's quite a lot. I'd say it's maybe more Bradford-on-Avon.
Okay.
You ever been to Dunkerton?
I haven't, actually. They're just making places up. New Dunkerton City.
These are just made up locations that Matthew's sort of creating. No, I think if you can't access it via a train station, I've not been there basically in Somerset. So apart from those Wookie Hole Caves, I went on a very boring date to those a couple of years ago.
Made me just think, this is not going to work out, and that was the last time we saw each other. Tough times for your boy. But anyway, back to the legend, and it's just a great game, isn't it?
And so they did it. I'm keen to see what they do with Zelda next, but if they kept large chunks of this, just the idea of a big open world that Nintendo has built to give you joy and surprise, to not know what's going to come out, if something's going to come out of a lake and truly take your breath away, or to not know there's a big weird flower fairy lady who's going to pop out and give you a jump scare because you didn't know that was even in the game. A very visceral memory I have of playing this.
Or a dark spot in the map where you're like, well, what's that over there? Then you go in there and suddenly a game within the game has started, and you're like, right, I've got to get the fuck out of here. How does this actually work?
I mean, open world game design that you'd never seen before and just so unsynaical. It was amazing. There it is.
I think Enuma needs to hold his nerve and crack this world out one last time.
I think just, but make a new one, I say. Just like make a new land.
Same land. Do it again. Go for the trilogy.
Do it, do it and take away the hole in the sky. Go back to the original.
I thought you were going to suggest a second layer of caves. A second hole. Yeah, a second hole.
Okay. That's the list done, Matthew. Any honorable mentions you want to chuck out?
Uncharted Lost Legacy. I did really like. Great hang.
I think they really mastered their little open world sections by that game and that one is a real joy, driving around in the Jeep.
Nice. Yeah, that was probably the number one game that didn't make the list. I think people would expect to make the list is Uncharted Lost Legacy.
Chloe definitely in my top five gaming waifus. Absolutely. So glad that they brought Chloe back because she felt a little bit forgotten in Uncharted 4.
So that was good. But please carry on, Matthew.
I really liked Tacoma this year.
Oh, yeah. Kind of a forgotten sort of walking sim this game.
Yeah. I just, I don't know. I always, Gone Home never really did it for me.
I thought I was quite overrated as a game and I never really kind of, I just didn't really care for the story. It told a huge amount and didn't find it particularly interesting. And I much preferred the sci-fi setting of this.
I liked the mechanic of the sort of holographic memories and sort of scrubbing through the scenes and, you know, walking through these scenes and seeing them play out from like different angles and catching, you know, which bit of little dialogue you missed on this replay and then you stand somewhere else and you just perceive the scene differently. It's sort of it. It mechanically did a lot more with sort of similar ingredients.
So I thought that was that was really good. Death of the Outsider. That was this year, wasn't it?
It was.
Yes. I mean, you know, more Dishonored. Not my favourite protagonist sort of power wise.
It's like a little less sort of out and out power fantasy that I think you had in Dishonored 2, but it's got some great scenarios in it. I think you have to play everything that they make in the Dishonored, but none of it is a waste of your time. It all has something to say and to contribute and has a certain standard of quality of writing.
It's the only Dishonored thing I've never played, actually. So yeah, I've got to crack this out at some point and play through it. Because I know they remixed a couple of the different environments as well.
So I would love to see how they do that. And a good character, Billy Lurk, as well, from the main game and stuff.
Yeah, my only other one was Stories Untold, I really liked.
Oh, that was this year. That actually would have made my top ten had I remembered.
I think that was this year.
Yeah, you're right. That was a great game.
Which was, is that no code? Code, yes. A sort of horror anthology where each section of the game played out kind of using a different interface, a different kind of retro technology.
All quite sort of spooky. I'm doing a bit of a disservice to say, well, it's a bit Black Mirror-ish because it uses technology to get across these horror games. But from like an interactive text venture to just using strange sort of medical apparatus.
Yeah, a really interesting sort of mood piece. Everything they've done has been super interesting. Cannot wait to see what they're doing with their Silent Hill game.
So yes, very good.
Long time in development now as well. Like their last game came out pre-COVID, I think. Observation, never played Observation, actually.
I should go through that at some point. I loved Stories Untold. I think that it did smartly capitalize on the re-emergence of interest in anthology shows that was around this time, like Black Mirror and Inside No.
9, and also the Stranger Things aesthetic they went for a little bit with some of the marketing materials of this game. I did really like how the last episode of this does something that the other episodes don't do as well. You feel like you're playing chapters where it's just one thing that you're doing over and over again, and that is the story, and then the last chapter just does something a bit different.
A really cool thing to discover, it doesn't take long to play through, and it was just a really original feeling thing. I think for those who are aware of John McKellen's work on Alien Isolation, then the kind of obsession with old analog tech and a certain visual style here made perfect sense, and I felt like it was a little bit of like, if you enjoyed Alien Isolation, if you're an Alien Isolation diehard, you should play this too. It's a good game to recommend to fans of that game, I would say.
Good stuff, Matthew. The only other ones I'm going to chuck in there, the incredibly daft Injustice 2, which has very high production values for superheroes punching each other. I have to applaud it.
I did enjoy playing through the campaign of this. I think the best thing Netherrealm do with these games is just make really silly but enjoyable campaigns, and this has loads of steamy superheroes in it, and it's so much more visually spectacular than the original Injustice, which has a bit of a PS2 energy to it, I think. But this one's definitely a bit sharper.
Still a 7 out of 10, but a really fun one. XCOM 2 War of the Chosen, just mixing that game up with loads of new mechanics and these boss characters in there. I think I've still got a big XCOM 2 phase to come in my life.
I've still played more of Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within than I have too. But from what I played of this, which at the time was probably about 12, 14 hours of a campaign, just does some really smart things, and you see Marvel's Midnight Suns benefiting from the choices made there. Heat Signature, Tom Francis' game, Matthew, which we talked about recently on the Atari episode, saying it was a good version of a very bad Atari game that we played.
But it was cool, a mix of Hotline Miami and Spaceship simulation stuff, just an interesting little game that's probably easy to get cheap. Final Fantasy XII, The Zodiac Age, they rebuilt and repackaged this game from this year. Person Highlight was writing the Final Fantasy XII cover feature that went along with this for Retro Gamer.
That was really nice to do. Those are just the other ones I wanted to throw in there. As mentioned, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, a lot of Wii U games started coming to Switch this year and this was a phenomenon.
It was fun to play with the old Switch propped up and just getting two little controllers on the go. Good memories of doing that. A grand year in games, I suppose I should also mention Resident Evil 7 Matthew, seems like we're being too catty if we don't mention that at least once.
But not a true favorite of ours, but definitely has its moments, so there it is. And Little Nightmares as mentioned, 2D sort of like horror adjacent game, bit spooky, bit Tim Burton-y I guess, a bit more horrible than that, but ended up being a pretty popular series in its own right and kind of like a slightly more palatable in terms of tone, less disgusting. Well, no, that's not true actually, because there are some disgusting bits in this.
I could say less disgusting than inside, but just sort of in that kind of like mode of limbo inside, sort of like size scrolling horror-y thing, horror-y platformer. And those are the games, Matthew. The podcast is over.
