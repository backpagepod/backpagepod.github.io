Hello and welcome to the Backpage Player Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello? Matthew, I don't want to ask how's your tooth hole on every episode, but got anything stuck in there lately?

Matthew
00:30
No, it's I I think it's like he healed.

Samuel
00:32
Okay, good. Well I'm glad we're here. Content stream. Some listeners were frustrated you never answered my question about how much it would cost to put a new tooth there. Did what what would the cost be? I don't know. I don't know Okay, damn. 'Cause people people seem to really want to know, because I asked you like three times that podcast and you wouldn't elaborate. And some people thought that was because it w it might be quite cheap and you were just refusing to pay it. And others were like, Well actually I think you'll find dental surgery costs a lot of money and really we got nowhere but um we have no further information so um and Going up on that front. That's a a piece of backpage lore that will never be filled in. Yeah, the wiki page is a stub for that one.

Matthew
01:12
Just look it up online. You can look at you've all got Google. Type in tooth replacement cost.

Samuel
01:18
Yes, new tooth price. Yes. Very good. Okay. This podcast then, it's all about RPGs, because Boulders Gate 3 came out and over half a million of people are playing it simultaneously at any one time on Steam. Which is enormous. It's a huge game from Larian, obviously a successor to to foundational uh RPGs from the um the nineties and noughties. So a huge deal this has finally come along and It appears to be one of the biggest games of the year. And to talk about RPGs in general, we've brought back popular Backpage guest, Jeremy Peel. Jeremy, how's it going?

Jeremy
01:53
Hello, I'm good, thanks. I noticed um a couple of weeks ago when you had uh Margaret, former edge editor on, you you apologized for your opening bullshit to her, but you you don't do that with me

Matthew
02:05
It's sort of like when your parents you're scum like us.

Jeremy
02:08
Well yeah, I I'm very like part of the you know, furniture. It's a compliment in a way, but uh it's like when your parents have friends around and you're like I've never seen these plates before. Everyone's making an effort.

Samuel
02:20
Yeah, we were just a bit more intimidated, I think, with Margaret and um as as some listeners identified. She's obviously very nice, but Um also we didn't know her, so we didn't know how sort of like uh tooth holy we could be about that stuff. Did we talk about your tooth at the start of the episode anyway, Matthew? I can't remember.

Matthew
02:36
No, we talked about uh eating bats and getting heartburnt and then she was eating a bat and actually I felt Like in hindsight, listening back to it, she would have been well up for the Batch.

Jeremy
02:46
Yeah, you realize too late she was a kindred spirit in the in the back of that.

Samuel
02:50
Yeah. I think the problem is that we assume based on the tone of Edge that all edge editors are gonna be quite severe, but then they're not and it's fine. So yeah.

Jeremy
02:59
Yeah, I think Edge As to sort of like counter uh program that, it's like the first time I got like notes on edge style from Jen Simpkins, there was a bit and it was like we can be funny, we're allowed to be funny, as everyone assumes that yeah, yeah, you've got to leave your sense of humor at the door.

Samuel
03:16
Yeah, exactly. Just no emojis in the body text. That's the uh you know, that they draw the line at that.

Matthew
03:21
There was a very funny Oh what a short lived meme on the Discord where Jeremy was enlisted as as uh it sounds crass to talk about it, but I can't remember what it what was it relating to? That was someone Always sunny, wasn't it? It was an always sunny meme where for some reason me and Samuel had been listed as as being bitches for some reason. Oh that's it. But for some reason Because the meme had three spaces, the third pitch was Jeremy, which really made me laugh that out of nowhere it's been pulled into this and insulted by this. Um that really made me laugh.

Jeremy
04:01
That was some fake Well that was like the photo that I use on social media which was from my when I got engaged, like we did an engagement photo shoot. And there it is pinned up on that board in the beam with the word But aga again sort of flattering. It was like oh the if the community needs to think of a third presenter who isn't one of you, like for me to be the first backup. Uh present that like that's nice. That's a nice thing. It's nice nice to be good to be bitch. It's good to be

Samuel
04:35
Yeah, you know, to put it in like ninety sort of tennis parlance, if me and Matthew are Tim Henneman and Greg Risetsky, then you're very much Barry Cowan, uh Jeremy.

Jeremy
04:43
So you know I feel like I'm recording with Phil again. That's exactly the kind of analogy he would make that goes. Straight out of my head.

Samuel
04:49
That's one of the two sports references I can basically make. And uh yeah, and that's it. Um how's uh work stuff going? Like uh you're on the freelance train these days, I imagine you're still very much in demand given the high quality of your work and your ability to use punctuation.

Jeremy
05:05
Well thank you.

Samuel
05:06
Um yeah it's it's going really well.

Jeremy
05:08
Um Uh like I I won't lie, like it's been very tricky for everyone freelancing this last kind of six months to a year, like not to be too dow, but like cost of living crisis and just, you know, the the money doesn't really kind of match up to that at the moment. But um I d you know, I've I've leaned more into the the mock review end of things, which uh is something that you put me onto Samuel. Can we say that? Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah, so that and and that's turned out to be something that I really, really like. I think Margaret mentioned that, you know, she'd done some kind of work in that sphere and it's like I I suppose as a journalist you always hope that your criticism will improve the games you write about on some level. That you know that the developers will process it and apply it to their future stuff. But um you know sort of a vague hope whereas with mock reviews like they get you in before the game comes out to find out you know get an outside eye on on where the games are. So uh yeah it's it's pretty rewarding to be able to go you you need to be aware of this or Maybe you could double down on that because that's really cool and then just sort of back out and let them crack on with it because you know I'm no I'm no game developer but hopefully I've I've learned enough over the last decade that it's of of use to them. For me to give him some opinions.

Samuel
06:31
Yeah, I'm pleased to hear that. I think like uh part of me giving it to you in the first place was just uh, you know, I thought, oh Jeremy would thrive in this space. But I know that There are so many things in games where you think, oh, on the writing side, it would be really cool to do X. I just need someone to give me a chance to do X. Yeah. And so Once you've opened the door, I'm glad it leads to more stuff. So I think some industry people listen to this, Jeremy. So, you know, they can get in touch with you if they uh need your services, particularly I guess RPG strategy games, are those your sort of key areas?

Jeremy
07:02
Yeah, um turn-based tactics, all that kind of thing. Uh first person shooters. Uh yeah. I should also say I'm still, you know, doing the journals and writing for edge and rock, paper, shotgun and PC gamer and stuff. Because I think sometimes if you if you mention you do a new thing, people assume that you stop doing everything else. I I'm still a journalist. And I also feel that I feel that's important, like that's part of the deal with a working in mock reviews and stuff is like you're supposed to have your hand in and be somebody who can actually say, well this is how journalists are likely to respond.

Samuel
07:38
Yeah, absolutely. It's uh yeah, it's cool because um I I've noticed as well in your regular work, obviously you and uh Phili Wanyuk co-hosted PC Gaming Classics for us, which is uh rolled out on the f rolling out on the free feed now and so people are getting to listen to that whole series which is cool. Um but I noticed as well that you basically every single game that's that you covered you've turned into like a subsequent like opinion feature about that game which I thought was very caddy of you. Suddenly there's a trespasser Jurassic Park piece popping up on I think it was rock paper shotgun. Um So that's been it's been lucrative for you all all around, Jeremy.

Jeremy
08:11
Yeah, that's that's freelance thinking, definitely. And uh yeah, I th thought of them as companion pieces to uh to the episodes. I think there is, yeah, a published piece. for every single one of those episodes um for for listeners to hunt down.

Samuel
08:28
Nice. That's a little task for them, tick them off. Kind of where's Wally style. So yeah, if I suppose if people want to reach out to you for work, you Jeremy D. Peel on uh Twitter. Jeremy, is that right?

Jeremy
08:37
Uh Jeremy underscore Peel. Uh there you go. And it's it's X. actually. Yeah, that's my mistake. Apologies. It always has been, and they've always been repos, not retweets.

Samuel
08:50
Yep, so um we have roped you back in with the uh uh enticing promise of eighty pounds to talk about some old RPGs.

Jeremy
08:57
Is it eighty now? That's That's amazing.

Samuel
09:00
I thought it was 40.

Jeremy
09:01
That's even better.

Samuel
09:01
Well we're depending on you we're depending on you to carry this episode, so we're kind of up the feet slightly. There's a bit there's a bit of that going on, honestly. Um But yes, we're delighted to have you back for that. So um yeah, I I suppose like actually before we get into that, how do you feel about being subsumed into the larger backpage universe, Jeremy? I think you like you say you are seen as a sort of like uh you know, a th sort of third lead if there was to be one. Like um and people sort of I don't know, talk about you like you are a fictional character sometimes and I just wonder how you feel about that.

Jeremy
09:29
It's quite funny, especially 'cause I'm fairly active on the Discord, so to just rock up and like see people having talked about me as a alongside PS1 Hagrid is is always funny. But um I like it. uh the plaything and the way it might be in another community, I guess. So f so far it hasn't been frightening, I would say, is my uh my summary of those events That's fair.

Samuel
10:04
How would you rate our interactions with our Discord?

Jeremy
10:07
Well, I think, you know, you you keep a sort of uh you operate with a healthy disdain for your uh for your listeners, Samuel And uh Matthew, I don't think you I don't think you do. I don't think you do do that. You just keep a a healthy distance, I suppose. Um whereas yeah I I I've got stuck in.

Matthew
10:25
Yeah, I'd sort of I do I do um I probably shouldn't bad mouth them as much as they do on the pod. They love it. They love it. We do feel I feel bad for throwing the Tears of the Kingdom. uh uh channel under the bus, but you know, some channels need to be thrown under a bus.

Jeremy
10:42
It's alright, we'll get we'll get to RPG's channel. I'll I'll um I'll give them what for later on. It's fine.

Samuel
10:49
I I sort of think um that very much that whole sort of like Bilbo baggins are like half as much half you know half of you, half as much as you deserve, all that stuff is very much my approach to community management. So just like you say, a help maybe a healthy disdain is probably the best way to put it, Jeremy. So yes, um pleased to have you back on the podcast, Jeremy. Was the last time you came on the regular podcast, the um GTA Clones on Trial episode?

Jeremy
11:12
Uh yeah, I think it was. Yeah.

Samuel
11:14
I was really fun that one. Yeah. I really enjoyed that one We should put more um sort of like uh naughty genres on trial, Matthew. Let's try and think of some and then we'll um we'll litigate that in uh with Judge Castle. Okay, so this episode all about RPGs. So So we're gonna try and like cover the sweep of the genre, but we're gonna pick up basically where the Infinity Engine RPGs start. So because we think that's probably the most relevant to our listeners. Probably the most interesting games to talk about, and certainly if we're talking about Boulder Scape 3, it's the most relevant place to to sort of focus our discussion. So Little bit of background. The RPG is one of the oldest genres in games dating back to university mainframes in the 70s like Dungeon and Oubliette. I know nothing about university mainframes. I just read this in a Richard Cobbett piece on the history of RPGs and PC gamer, so copying to that straight away. I will cite it. Um in the 80s the genre became more of a home PC concern with influential dungeon crawler games like Rogue and Nethack. Wizardry, the game becomes so popular in Japan that it inspires the creation of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, a real fork in the road and in some ways still is um defining that genre. You have the Bard's Tale along the way, which is a another important game in terms of um terms of setting, um which uh was becoming a more pronounced element of these games over time. The Ultima series becomes hugely important because it puts story at the heart of these games and not just monsters and dungeons, which the vast majority of these games were. and pushes that story element further and further with subsequent entries. The genre stagnates outside of its most popular series in the first half of the 90s, and then by the second half of the 90s you have the likes of Fallout in 907. Boulders Gate in 1998 with story, branching dialogue, consequences, and interesting settings define an era of games that reach a newfound level of popularity. So, a bit of an overview there, which is hopefully useful. Basically, that was my excuse of speeding through about 20 years of history of one genre in about 45 seconds. So Jeremy, what was your first exposure to old house RPGs? Because listening to the PC Gaming Classics series, I got the impression that a lot of and I think having you on the pod before you discuss this. A lot of this for you was sort of like excavation from a kind of like, you know, historical point of view, because you're educating yourself in the in the naughs about this stuff. Was that was that how you came to RPGs as well?

Jeremy
13:31
Yeah, I think that's fair. By the way, I think Richard Cobert is our university mainframe. He's the keeper of all PC gaming history and we would be lost without him at this point. Um Yeah, so I my first encounter with an RPG was Boulder's Gate and it was on my uncle's shelf in his study and that would have been like the very early naughty so at that point it had already been out for a couple of years. He had a version with like six discs I think and the expansion in there. And um, you know, I was also happening at that time the Lord of the Rings film, so I was already a Lord of the Rings kid. I'd read the books and uh Here was this game where y you had a a wizard who would occasionally pop up who's called Elminster, not Gandalf, but still with a sort of frustrating like lack of frequency, leaving you to your own uh devices to be nearly killed constantly. And uh and it c it sort of to me really captured that like Fellowship of the Ring style danger in the wilderness and like a sort of desperate hunt for allies on the road and also being wary of you know people who are hunting you. Yeah, and I I still think like I still have a wariness about anyone who who explicitly uses the word friend as in like high friend because in Boulder's Gate If anybody ever said hello friend, they were always an assassin. They were always there to kill you. So that was instilled in me at an early age. Uh but yeah.

Matthew
15:05
These games have basically um impinge your ability to to like have nice social relations with people. Well yeah, exactly.

Jeremy
15:13
It g it it allows me to still Enjoy real time with pause combat which most people can't, but it has inhibited my ability to form connections with fellow human beings, so who can say whether that's worse? Um yeah. But yeah, that g that game is hugely, hugely formative to me and I just kind of clocked that it was as you do you're like, okay, there are these splash screens that say Atari and Black Isle and Bioware. and Dungeons and Dragons and if I see those elsewhere on game boxes I'm probably gonna try and get that and try that game. So and and at that point All of those games were at least a couple of years old and they were kind of in budget sections uh and stuff like that. So it it became quite feasible to to become a a D head digitally in pretty short order.

Samuel
16:04
Yeah, absolutely. So yes, there's um there was like a a an explosion of uh popularities for games off the back of uh Boulderscape, which I think a lot of its success was driven by how it looked as well, versus previous RPGs that were mostly tile based, this was um a step up in terms of the sprites on the the uh very specific type of backgrounds that they made for for these games. So that um came to be a commonality between the Infinity Engine the Infinity Engine games is just how they how they sort of looked and functioned was um was what they had in common. So Matthew, when did Boulders Gate end up being a big deal to you and how did that sort of happen?

Matthew
16:43
Uh I mean Cynically, it's probably a bigger deal now because of Bordersgate 3 and and tr you know, trying to kind of educate myself a bit better. Um I did play uh them back in the day like with friends. They weren't games like I owned, but my friend Dan had them and Um I never really understood them. Like one of the big things p replaying them now was like I was amazed we ever got through them. or were able to pass them because there's a lot of like D<unk>D stuff like I I I didn't understand then. I don't really understand now, but like, you know, when I when I did my big replay recently I had to rely like very heavily on external guides and people explaining things. You know, there's this there's lots of like invisible systems in this game and invisible rules and So yeah, I was just like, how on how on earth did this make any sense to me like twenty years ago or whatever? But yeah, in terms of like you know, di digging deeper into them and actually having kind of like a better appreciation of them. That's definitely a more recent thing. Um, I feel like there's like waves of nostalgia for this. Um I I mean there's always been a nostalgia for it but like Uh like a lot of people who played these games when they were kids who've now grown up and become cool games journalists are writing lots of good stuff about it. Um I really liked there was the PC gamer issue which did loads of um like retrospective stuff on Bordersgate 2. Uh it was like a big Well, I don't know if was it like a cover feature? I can't remember how they did it. How long ago was this? Uh in the last last four years.

Samuel
18:24
Okay, right. So after my time.

Matthew
18:26
Yeah. Yeah. But it was it was it was basically like a th the their main feature of that issue was lots of different authors tackling you know, different bits of Bordersgate two and um that just got me like really excited for it again and thinking, Oh, I don't have any deep thoughts on this game. I should really revisit this and and get into it and that kind of paid off obviously with around Bordersgate three, which was covering quite closely on RPS. So, you know, it's it's probably more of a job thing than uh than a like a you know, I can't claim to have been playing and loving these games for the last 20 years.

Samuel
19:02
That's fair enough, yeah. But I think a lot of people's RPG journey starts with Bob of Sky, I think, to use a crude analogy that'll make Jeremy cringe. I guess it probably did for you know, for that type of RPG, what Final Fantasy VII did for JRPGs, right? It was an easy touchstone with a really good setting and you know, defined the genre in a lot of ways for for a few years to come. So yeah. Um God, Jeremy.

Jeremy
19:25
Yeah, I think that's true. And it's easy to to kind of not see now how how striking it it would have been at the time, I guess, because it's actually a a a really strange sort of hybrid. system they came up with for that game. Like Bioware were playing a lot of Warcraft and to kind of infuse Dungeons and Dragons, obviously traditionally this turn-based thing. with this sort of real-time isometric thing where you are moving all your guys around in in, you know, and and it's it's a very weird sort of You know, you're still kind of calculating things turn by turn. You can still pause and and do things tactically, but it has this sort of immediacy to it. which sort of I guess for the first time it was like, oh, I can see D and D moving around in a you know, a fairly convincing way. And then yeah, once you get onto Baldur's Gate Two, that's where like so much of what we know, you know, modern Western RPGs of like companions and them bickering with each other and with you and the way that all kind of connects together in quests, like that's kind of the form where the formula was first. set pretty much. So these were the games that allowed the entire genre as we know it to happen afterwards pretty much

Samuel
20:41
Damn, we brought the right guest on for this episode, Matthew. That's good. Not that any doubt. So Jeremy, did you have much exposure to the early RPGs that were precursors to the Infinity Engine game? games, the likes of Ultima or Wizardry. Did did you pick up that stuff in your education for the uh f for the genre?

Jeremy
20:58
Not at all. Um like only more recently when I've gone out of my way to kind of figure out, you know, what they are and and why they were important. I think because there was that sort of gap from the early 90s to the mid to late 90s where RPGs weren't really happening. That was just ancient history by the time of of Boulders Gate and um you know throughout the 80s there was the the the Bioware and Bethesda of the day were you know you had uh Ultima from uh from Origin and and uh Wizardry from Sirtec like they were the two sort of big deals in in Western RPGs and really important but for me that like I had no connection to them. Like I remember when um you know Divinity original Sync came out which we'll get to but I remember I was really excited about that game because to me it felt like Boulder's Gate. It had that sort of interactive depth that I'd felt in those games. And I said this to I can't remember whether it was uh Adam Smith, who's lead writer on Boulders Gate 3, but was a journalist at that time, or Or it might have been Fraser Brown of PC Gamer and I'd said, Oh, it's like Boulder's Gate and one of them had said, Well, uh Ultima and me going, Oh right, like, oh I don't really understand like what the primary inspiration of this this game that I now really like is and I better kind of dig it out and uh And get to grips with it just a little.

Samuel
22:28
Yeah. I think I I understand why you would have that relationship with the genre though, it by getting to Baldur's Gate first, because I remember the very first issue of Piece of Gamer I bought had a preview of Boulder's Gate in it. And I think it also had a piece on Ultima Online in it. And Ultima Online looked so old as hell even at the time. Yeah. Because obviously it was ambitious and in other ways and was doing a a lot of other different things. But I remember like even then just Ultima what I read about Ultima and when I saw it it seemed old hat compared to what Bouldersgate was. It just it seemed like there was a an era change there. So even by missing it by a few years I can see why, you know, it would compl that would completely bypass you that um you know, that part of the genre's legacy, so that makes sense to me. So, Jeremy, what do you think drove the success of the Infinity Engine RPGs and Why and that generation of RPGs around it, why did those games in particular become such a big deal?

Jeremy
23:24
I think partly because of that that immediacy and they were they told really good stories like even when you know it's uh the infinity engine is one of those where they made boulders gate Bioware made Boulders Gate, but kind of, you know, with um with Interplay as Publisher and Black Isle sort of in the background and then Black Isle made the sort of quick spin-off games which was the Icewind Dale series and even those are just so much better than they they deserve to be. Like I remember um Josh Sawyer saying And there's some disagreement about the exact timer, but he said that Ice Cream Dale 2 is made in like four or five months. Uh I think if you ask Fergus Urkhart, who was head of Black Isle at the time, he'll he says it's a little bit longer, but like there were there were like a high frequency of these games which were clearly related. So it was like i they were very sort of well poised to take advantage of the success of Boulders Gate because they were like, well immediately there's um two or three other games or within a few years there are other games that are clearly function the same way, have the same like attention to detail and storytelling. Um and also like the Forgotten Realms, the set setting of Baldur's Gate and Icewindale, part of the magic of it is that it's so like um it's kind of this vanilla canvas to that you can apply any sort of uh Tolkien esque fantasy adventure to and once you've kind of invested in one You're like, oh, so I I get that Icewind Dale is up the road on the Sol Coast from the city of Baldur's Gate and you know Neverwinter Nights is also somewhere along that path and like you sort of develop a history with the with the place and the and the geography of it. So I think once you once you connect with one of them then it feels like that's a place that you want to return to and can do.

Samuel
25:27
Yeah, it's a way into that entire it's a way into like a fictional location, but also an entire genre that's connected to that fictional location basically. Yeah.

Matthew
25:36
I I am curious how much of it as well is is the success of translating something which is popular in another gaming form successfully into a video game. Because like a lot of the conversation around Borders Gate 3 now is coming from the perspective of like the DD fanbase, which is obviously massive and DD's had This is like huge resurgence. Um but there's a lot of excitement about seeing something you love in that game being in the video game, whether your character and its weird quirks of its class or whatever are gonna be accurately represented. And I I wonder I knew you know it's I don't know if anyone really has an answer to this, but I do wonder if there was like a s it could ride a similar wave back then, um, just as a sort of successful sort of translation of things that people seem to understand. Because, you know, like I said, when I first played it, there was loads of stuff I was like, I have no idea what this means or like Like all these strange acronyms, you know, what the fuck is FACO, you know, all this kind of stuff. Um and um But but it must have res you know, just you know, looking at the numbers, it you know, it must have resonated and I'd be curious how much of that was you know, if if it was basically doing what Bordersgate 3 is doing now, but back then in terms of like harnessing that pre- existing fan base.

Jeremy
26:56
Yeah, I mean yeah like obviously D D was huge in the in the 80s as as well. That's what Stranger Things feeds off. And um I can imagine like you know, ev every game developer working in the nineties and naughties pretty much like has D and D as a core influence as far as I can tell. And I th I can imagine as well that like for players if you you grow up playing tabletop Dungeons and Dragons to then have like oh this reasonably accessible digital version which you can play for an hour by yourself and then put down as a as a grown-up um is hugely appealing. And also like anything that you play that involves like models or you know, maps and bits of text and stuff, like I feel like a part of you is always going, It'd be cool to see this come to life. in some form, like to see these things move and like I think that's an eternal attraction of video game adaptations of tabletop stuff is like, oh my god, I can actually see um you know, I can actually see that saw being swung. Mm-hmm.

Samuel
28:00
Yeah. I I did also get the slight impression that Bouldersgate was maybe responsible for a partial revival in popularity for DD at the time too. So that might be I got that impression from reading a bit around it. So that, you know, m that might be one area where it does differ a little bit where obviously like you say Matthew, DD is so popular now that it's it's kind of overtaken any and all all things, but certainly like I think that thinking of D D as an eighties phenomenon, that's sort of like how it was pr presented when people discussed it in the nineties and therefore it would make sense that game developers were playing that in the eighties and then making games in the nineties based on those systems. I don't again I I you know having not lived it I'm not entirely sure but that was the impression I got that it was at least partly responsible for you know, some kind of like boost in fortunes for D D more generally at the time. Um Jeremy, Planescape Torment is, I suppose, like the the other game that's worth pulling out here. What's your relationship to that game and why does that game in particular have a a reputation apart from other Infinity Engine games?

Jeremy
29:06
Yeah, I'm actually less personally connected to Planescape Torment, but like it is a huge is an important part of the picture. I got really into that spiritual successor to it, uh Torment Times of Numenera. Like I really like that. And that captures the same kind of like it's a you know There's sort of um a spectrum that you know once Boulder's Gate exists, it's almost as if Black Art kind of just played with the dials and they were like, okay, we'll do uh a dungeon crawler version which is more about like leaning into the combat and the kind of combat puzzles and the writing is still really good where we have it but it's less about that and that's how I swindle And then they pull the dial in the opposite direction, they're like, okay, this is Plainscape Torment and this is about dialogue and that whole I think there's a whole lineage there that sort of ends with the disco Elysium where it's almost uh sort of very choice-driven visual novel uh kind of end of the end of the genre where and it's not just like dialogue text there are sort of these very deep and prosy descriptions of what you're seeing and what's going on. I think really like the sprite the sprites of it all. really lent itself to that kind of literary thing. Like there's a gap when you play those games between what you see and what plays out in your head because it's you know, that basic on screen. So you can describe in text in a very sort of novelistic way what's going on and accept that like, okay, there's not a lot happening on screen but it's playing out you know in my imagination. So yeah I feel like that that is a really important side of the genre which people clearly still have an appetite for

Samuel
30:57
Yeah, it's interesting as well because um when I saw obviously when uh Torment Tizer New Monera uh was released, the kind of spiritual successor to Plainscape Torment. There was it it seemed like the sheer amount of writing in that game was actually kind of divisive, but with um Disco Elysium. that approach doesn't um I wasn't really critiqued at all because people really enjoyed maybe they just enjoyed the writing more or Just in so uh such a small handful of games to have some that are so combat oriented and then some that are so storytelling oriented, it's uh just really interesting to see that day DNA spit off almost right away, you know.

Matthew
31:34
So uh I g I guess that sort of reflects the range of DMs though as well, right? Because isn't that that's i in in the in these worlds the writers of these games are your kind of imaginary DM that you're playing with and different people are gonna play different kind of games. So I kind of it it makes it sort of makes sense that there would be a spread of angles on this.

Jeremy
31:55
Yeah, yeah. With some DMs being very like stats driven and and focused on the rules and others, you know, treating D D as like it's a tool for the imagination and we can dip into these the dice and stuff as and when we need it um but it's j it's just an assist for um what we're all kind of conjuring in our heads together

Samuel
32:16
In parallel, you had the explosive success of uh Blizzard's Diablo. I read a piece, Jeremy, that you wrote, where Larry and talked about how it was only possible to get ARPGs made for a while. and there just wasn't the appetite for anything anything else. Like what consequence do you think that had on the RPG landscape? The piece was really good by the way. It's about I think it was about how Ultima 7 informed. um Larian's games and how there's um they try and put a piece of that game in every in every game. But um yeah the uh the the Diablo side of things, how did that sort of filter into the genre do you think?

Jeremy
32:46
Yeah I th I think Well, for one thing, Baldur's Gate and Diablo kind of blew up at this yeah, at this at the same time, as you say, and but Diablo blew up Bigger. Um I feel like rooted at the root of this is a sort of fundamental unfortunate disconnect between these two games or like they look similar. If you look at like um you know a story driven DD based RPG of the time And you look at Diablo, especially if you're a publisher, you're like, well, this is this isometric thing where you hit things with swords and couldn't we steer it more in the direction of this you know, this version that makes more money. But they you know, they're also completely f different in their aims, like, you know, Diablo being this sort of uh skinner box kind of very immediate satisfaction driven combat box. Like obviously there's there's huge depth to Diablo and rewards that keep people playing it for thousands of hours. But it's so different from the kind of slow burn, choice and consequence, um prepare your spells and have a nice long rest uh end of RPGs. Like these are not not closely related at all really. Um, so I think it was kind of a toxic influence on Western RPGs for a little while. Through no fault of Blizzards, obviously, like they're just making the the cool game they want to make and there's a huge audience for. But yeah, a developer like Larion who hasn't made a game before and has to just kind of take what they get from a publisher, if they say cool, like strip out the heart of this and make it more like Diablo then that's what they have to do. That's what was going on at that time.

Matthew
34:34
But Larion I think they're they're kind of like quite an interesting studio and you know, not not you know, their their earlier games weren't massive by any means, but I think they actually do like marry the two stars. Like why they're working in the action RPG space. you know, I think Divine Divinity had it had some of elements that you would recognize in their later games. You know, it has like conversation trees. and branching quests and like weird interactions. It has the kind of reactivity that they've now become known for, which you'd maybe associate more with like the RPG side of things. Yeah. Or even there's that like there's that weird strand of like immersive sim, um, which also kind of like s it kind of emerges from all this this space. But um yeah I kind of like I don't know, I I I I'm I'm not like hugely familiar with Larian's early games, but like I've familiarized myself with them you know in in the in the wake of them being a modern success and trying to work out like w you know, what they're about and I actually kinda wish I had played them back in the day 'cause some of them sound quite cool, like the way they mix those two things.

Jeremy
35:40
Yeah, like absolutely there's like in Divine Divinity you can kinda like stack crates in the environment and it has that sort of like The the Ultima Seven influence on on Sven uh Svenvinka is like that's that side of it where it is like yeah, there's this kind of dense environment that you can you can muck about with like that there's definitely some of that even at the beginning of Lorian's games. Um but then you also get these kind of incredibly long and uh drawn out um Action RPG Dungeons at the same time. I remember um I played um Divine Divinity after I'd just written my dissertation at university and I'd like denied myself games for a few months. I was like and to get this to get this degree to where I want it to be. I just gotta des deny myself pleasure for a little while. Uh just didn't play anything. And once I'd handed it in You know that those moments where you finish a big project and there's a weird sense of loss and also numbness and you're like I don't really how do I what do I do now? And then I decided I'd play Divine Divinity through and I spent like two weeks doing nothing but playing this game. And eventually came to the conclusion that I hadn't been enjoying myself. Like I didn't I'd forgotten how to have fun. I was like, is this good? Is this a good game? I don't know. Um so like that game is entirely tied up in that experience for me. So I think it's a a deeply flawed like um concept because of that sort of the way it's tangled in in Diablo, but also like I'm probably a poor judge of it because I it was such a weird time for me to play that game. Right.

Samuel
37:24
Wow. It's it's a weird one though, because I feel like While Boulders Gate, that that lineage yields loads of games that people love and still talk about. Diablo, I feel like There aren't really Diablo likes from the time, or at least throughout the noughties, that I feel like people talk about or that have a reputation now. Whereas, you know, weirdly, you have to get to more of the like post Diablo 3 time for that to that to yield to things like Destiny or you know or uh Path of Exile where you actually there are actually like good Diablo likes uh around now. But I don't know. Are there any other games like Diablo from the late nineties or early noughties that really stuck Jeremy? Or was were they just the only ones?

Jeremy
38:05
There's Dungeon Siege, that was pretty big. Yeah. Um F funnily enough, Dungeon Siege was killed off by Obsidian. They were given Dungeon Siege 3. Which is really good, but they were like almost steering it back the other way towards their qualities, or like, well, make this very story heavy. uh world building uh infused uh dungeon siege and I was like this is great and uh I don't think that's what Dungeon Siege fans need or want from that game if there are any Dungeon Siege fans remaining. But yeah, that sort of died off in the uh naughty tens I think.

Samuel
38:44
Jerry, do you think that all games from that era were built equally or do we remember the ones that truly matter?

Jeremy
38:51
I guess there weren't that many of them. Like like the most of the ones we remember are most of the ones that there were. Like there wasn't a huge amount of kind of mimicry of what Bioware and Black Hell were doing. But there were other games that like Interplay was putting out like Uh there's one called Lionheart that nobody ever talks about, which is kind of shooting for a similar kind of deal and didn't really work out. But um, you know, there was there was kind of a a period where a quite brief period where Black Isle and Bioware were firing on all cylinders and putting out this stuff and then um it dried up pretty quickly. I think Divine Divinity is one of those games that like gets a lot of attention or it would come up in discussion of um of Infinity Engine style games because by 2002 There weren't really any others like that. They weren't really being made by that point. Um there were like kind of spin-offs for um from uh black owl as well like troika is is you know an important RPG developer and they they you know is found founded by the leads on the original Fallout uh they left and made um the first thing they made was Arcanum which is a game that plays a lot like the original Fallout but in a in a like high fantasy world. So there's stuff going on but um I don't feel like maybe it just simply wasn't kind of it was a hit but it wasn't Baldur's Gate was a hit but it wasn't a hit on the level that it caused the industry to kind of steer towards it at that time. There didn't seem to be like that kind of influx of of Boulders Gate clones.

Samuel
40:37
Yeah. So you have Interplay go out of business around this time too. So you have uh a Fallout sequel called Van Buren and a Boulder Skate game called the Blackhound, I believe, that just sort of like basically die either pr in production or pre-production. Jeremy, why do you think those types of games eventually waned in popularity? Or you know, why did the genre I guess have to have to change after a certain point

Jeremy
41:01
Uh 3D, I think basically. Like it's our old fashioned when 3D gaming was happening, it was such a kind of like transformative thing that if you were working in 2D or you know something kind of relatively flat seeming like an isometric isometric RPG. then you were caught kind of automatically passe at that moment and um you know developers as a whole pretty much had to pivot to um you know this is happening in the point and click adventure genre and all sorts of places where they kind of worked out very sophisticated ways of making these games and they have been at the a sort of peak of their um their powers and then 3D came along and these genres had to rework themselves um and there's a very sort of painful moment In you know, the Western RPG's history where it's like, well, it can't be this literary, um, incredibly open-ended thing anymore because we've got to um render these sort of high detail 3D scenes, as many of them as we can. And you know, it it suddenly looks bizarre to like have a Planescape Torment where you're describing this kind of intricate action that's unfolding in front of you and you're like, well I can't see it because we they couldn't animate it because there are too many scenes to have uh custom animations for all these scenes. Like it just becomes like a huge sort of like technical uh challenge or impossibility really to like create the same kinds of stories in in early 3D gaming and there's no like Financially there's no way at that moment to keep making the isometric ones.

Samuel
42:51
Yeah, and I think there's some I think some of this the games of the shopper do struggle to make the transition to 3D. I think isn't Ultima 9 a famously duff attempt to to do this quite early, Jeremy. Are you familiar with that with that game?

Jeremy
43:02
Yeah, I think only through like yeah its its reputation as a duffer. I don't think I've ever even seen a screenshot of uh of Ultima Nine. I mean there's like obviously a around that time as well, uh in fact no, that's way beforehand, but like Ultima had arguably made a very successful early transition into 3D when um looking glass made all underworld and they were like you can sort of argue I suppose that like immersive sims were like a 3D wing of RPGs that had already grown out of them Um but yeah, like sort of mainline RPGs turning into 3D was like was a difficult process and I think it took like, you know, the better part of a decade for that to become really sort of comfortable and sort of uncompromised.

Samuel
43:49
So when RPGs do reach the noughties, what happens to them? What does when does the form start to take a different shape and I guess It sounds like it's necessary that they did because players' expectations changed. But what happens basically to this whole genre when when you know we reach the say like PS2 Xbox era and the the a a time of more sophisticated three D graphics.

Jeremy
44:11
Yeah, I mean it all kind of hinges on bioware during this period, doesn't it? It's like whatever bow bioware does, that's where the genre goes. And um you had Neverwinter Nights, which was this kind of like halfway point between the Infinity Engine games. and uh and what came afterwards where it's it's it's three D um but it's still very much rooted in this like it's a translation of a tabletop game, but it's also maybe influenced by what's going on in in MMOs at that time. Like it's a there's a big sort of multiplier focus. Uh and then you have Knights of the Old Republic where like that's the first sort of big 3D success in Western RPGs. That and Morrowind, I guess. It's rich interesting, if you play Knights of the Old Republic, you're like, okay, there's still like D D under the hood here. Like there's a basic like D D stat system. And when you play the combat, it's still that kind of real time with Paul's think where you see your characters wait a few seconds for their turn and then do a front flip and hit a you know a a pig man with tusks. in the face. Um so you can kind of see like it's like this slow transition even from like the the genre leader at the time. Um and yeah, and then in tandem like Bethesda in a way like perfectly set up for this transition because they'd been working in very sort of crude 3D for a long time And so when they have Morrowind, which is just kind of like the latest iteration of their thing, like that's kind of well placed to be a hit on Xbox Yeah. And you know, you've you've talked very eloquently about the history of like early history of Xbox on this podcast and that whole thing where Microsoft were just very smart to like put energy into transporting leading PC developers onto console. Like that's when that starts. And you have Knights of the Old Republic and Morrowind as two surprise RP Western RPG hits on console where previously That's the home of Japanese RPGs and PC is the home of Western RPGs and like that's pretty much you know a a strict divide. That's an important moment where like these games are still transitioning into three D slightly uncomfortably, but they're finding um a huge new multi platform audience at the same time.

Samuel
46:38
Absolutely. Uh it's funny because I think that any time that someone recommends Star Wars Night Seal Republic to someone they should put the caveat in of let me tell you what happens in this combat before you play it because you you will not you will not be swinging a lightsaber, my friend, just to make that very clear. You will uh politely um ask a man to swing a lightsaber you know, one time after another while you um you know, you kind of manage some other stuff and a load of dice rolls happen. That's that's the thing I think that um like you say it's it is a bit odd that it's almost like yeah it's using uh uh D and D stuff under the hood, but the uh the experience is presentationally like, you know, o obviously quite far further ahead than um Boulder Skate was.

Jeremy
47:19
So, yeah, it's the equivalent of when you when you tell your sim to load the dishwasher after he's

Samuel
47:25
taking the bins out um but for lightsabers that's our little you're not swinging a lightsaber now but oh in in 20 seconds it's gonna be great Yeah, it's funny as well because I I remember playing Morrowind with a friend at the time and we were very pumped for it because we'd read about you know this. cool, uh sort of mature fantasy RPG with quite a strange setting. And then we were so underwhelmed because just because the it was such a rough version of what the Bethesda RPG experience would become with Oblivion and Fallout. It was such a like it was just it j it felt trapped between console and PC. It didn't feel totally at home there. It was uh just us getting like absolutely brutalized by small mud crabs over and over again and just thinking how will we ever make headway in this and then eventually just giving up and Popping uh assault on the control room and halo on because that's all that's all our fourteen year old brains could handle.

Jeremy
48:23
The water looks amazing though, eh? Brilliant water in that game. Uh yeah, that like Morrowind had a similar syndrome to Knights of the Old Republic, thinking about it in it like combating that. you directly swing your sword or fire your bow and then the maths decides whether you've hit or not. Right. I think that's such a that was such a turn off for people at the time. It's like there's clearly more going on here. And it's worse than, you know, it's it's an acceptable sort of discomfort when you're playing an isometric RPG and you're like, well, obviously I'm not that guy down there. I'm I'm steering that guy and telling him what to do. But then when you are the person, but you're still beholden to this kind of like unseen rule set that's like, ah Although you uh you aim correctly, uh your character is is insufficiently uh skilled to have made that hit. Like that's a really uncomfortable transition point for these games.

Samuel
49:17
We've covered the like the I suppose like the the sort of attempt to make these more of a multi format concern, Jeremy. What about um watch what else Troika were doing on PC? Because those those games obviously didn't come to console, so they were maybe on a slightly different track. What's What's their journey in the naughty?

Jeremy
49:31
Yeah, so they they throughout their existence basically like there was no money in RPGs uh of the kind they were making. They just sort of like struggled on. like throughout their entire existence. But like they made Arcanum which incredibly impressive game in some respects. Like you can still find videos on YouTube in Arcanum. It's like you throw a Molotov cocktail in a bar And every NPC reacts in a different way according to their AI and who they are in the world. You're like, oh my god, like the dream. Um but at the same time it's like pretty much like that's like the only bar in the world because there's this huge fant fantasy world and it's made by uh a very small team who can't afford to bring more people onto the project. So it's It's also very sparse. Yeah, and that you know, the o obviously the other sort of really big thing that lasting game that Troika made was um Bloodlines, the Vampire the Masquerade game, um which you know as many people have sorted out uh pointed out is effectively an immersive sim like they were You know, they were they were pushing to adapt, like they used the source engine the um Half-Life 2 was built on. arguably a little too early to be using that engine. Like I think it caused them a lot of problems and they they were, you know, like they were working to make a first person RPG which made sense in this kind of new age. And it turned out quite a lot like a sort of very buggy Deus Ex essentially and is uh beloved for that reason. So they were doing like experimental important things, but they never really had their their breakthrough moment. And yeah, I think at the time they were finished off, they were they were working on kind of resurrecting something like Fallout at a time where there was nothing like it. Um yeah. So it's it's reading about Troika is always pretty sad, but quite inspiring. They're one of those studios. Um although you know the the lead to of that studio kind of you know landed on their feet and have done well for themselves since. It's kind of a studio that has a special place in the hearts of uh Of RPG funds, I think.

Samuel
51:50
Okay, so um we're gonna take a short break after one last question. So Jeremy, you've been on trial in the Discord for your war on Japanese RPGs. What's all this about? 'Cause I genuinely miss this discourse. Uh so I don't hate Japanese RPGs.

Jeremy
52:06
But I d uh there's a so there's an RPG channel in the Discord, right? It's called RPGs and for for months it's been exclusively exclusively dedicated to Japanese RPGs And that's that's fine. There's an implicit understanding there that that's what it's about. But I objected to the fact it was called RPGs and nobody had mentioned uh The Witcher or or Baldur's Gate in like six months. And really it's it's not the discourse. It's not the discourse fault. It's rooted in this whole you know, sort of terminology problem of what an RPG is. Like an RPG is Boulders Gate or it's Diablo. Or it's Final Fantasy and these things have like inherently different design philosophies. Like I I have to be honest, like I grew up with PC gaming. And the first time I saw a JRPG, I was I was horrified by the way it operated. Like the I was like that nobody has had the ability to make a choice for like forty minutes, you know, it's it's all kind of just kind of plays out at the whim of the the developer. And uh and since then, you know, like I've I've had a lovely time with with Persona Four and and Nino Cooney. and I and I enjoy them for what they are. Um but it is it is quite shocking when you come to realise like there's a whole other set of people for whom RPG means something utterly different and kind of the almost the antithesis of what you know them to be. Like quite quite a hard thing to get over.

Samuel
53:45
I will say though that when you were talking about Persona 4 and Nino Kuni there, it did have the vibe of one of my best friends as a Japanese RPG.

Jeremy
53:54
Yeah. Oh it used to it used to happen with action LPGs as well. Like I have a distinct memory of being in the the room of one of m uh my mates at uni and he had a friend of a friend over and it and this guy said he really liked Boulders Gate and I was like, Oh Boulders Gate And we're just starting to enthuse and our mutual friend was sat in the middle and he just suddenly looked really dour and upset. I was like, Are you alright? And he was like, No, no, you're not talking about the same game. And it turned out his friend had uh meant Bouldersgate Dark Alliance, which is a Diablo clone and I I was talking about my Bouldersgate and we thought we'd formed a personal connection and in fact we couldn't be further apart.

Matthew
54:34
Funny, that's happened at work recently, because obviously Bordersgate 3 is coming to PS5 and um talking to some of my colleagues about it and they're like, Oh yeah, Bordersgate, Borders Water skate, you know the you're running through the running through the really reactive puddles and all that. Yeah, that's that's dark alliance. That's that's gonna be qu you're in for quite a different direction

Samuel
54:55
Yeah, I suppose th I suppose those probably were among the mo the most successful uh Diablo alike from the time because they just occupied the console space. But yeah, that was just a game about killing lots of rats and breaking barrels with them. A little knife. That's uh my memory of that game.

Matthew
55:09
Did they do an action RPG of the Bard's Tale as well?

Jeremy
55:12
They did. Um but yeah, it's a very weird period where that you have like Brian Fargo who was head of Interplay and had made the Bard's Tale and Greenlit Fallout and Baldur's Gate and and like Indonauties. That that was what he was making. It was uh like sort of Dark Alliance uh butt in my license. Um very strange uh period. Um you know, JRPGs and Disco, I think we worked it out now. We we have a system where each morning somebody says uh at dawn in the in that channel Western RPGs exist. Uh hello Jeremy. And then everyone moves on with their day and talks about uh persona

Matthew
56:00
But it kinda it does also make sense at that period though in terms of like what games can work on what machines where you know y you have to have a dark alliance on PS2. because you know, you probably haven't got the control or or interface or like fidelity of graphics to be able to kind of do it properly on console. So you end up with these weird spin-offs, and maybe that is just why, you know, JRPGs can be their best self on consoles in this period. Yeah. Which is probably why so many people kind of associate them or that is their experience of the whole genre.

Jeremy
56:32
Yeah, the the way people talked about console gaming versus PC gaming back then was so it was a completely different world. It was like We if we want to translate an experience for console, we need to start from scratch and build it completely differently. Although this came up in the Discord recently it's it's really strange how uh wizardry in the eighties was like a huge crossover hit in Japan and ends up being like a really formative um deal for Final Fantasy and you know the really big JRPGs. And I guess it does make you realise these things did have the same starting point. They just evolved. utterly separately to the point where someone who's grown up on one couldn't get their head around the other.

Matthew
57:18
Well, it's a bit like how over in Japan they have some people have like KFC for their Christmas dinner. It's a really old tradition. And you're like, well this is fundamentally we're starting from the same place. We have KFC, you have KFC. Yeah. It's just where they took KFC was very different.

Jeremy
57:37
It's just rooted in somebody who had an unusually successful marketing campaign at one time. Yeah, right.

Samuel
57:43
Yeah Well actually I should say with the Discord stuff. I feel like I'm the bad influence there, Jeremy, because I'm the one who's, you know, washed the the Discord um down with like uh hosed it down with Waka memes and other cursed Final Fantasy X content. That's on me But the other thing is that Japanese RPGs and Western RPGs have landed in the same place, basically, which is um open world-ish third-person action games. So they all somehow ended up taking the same track. Now obviously that's probably because games became much more sort of globalized in the noughties and twenty tens, so that that kind of makes sense. But yeah, in a way they did um they did kind of converge again. So that's um That's that's interesting. Um shall we take a quick break and then come back and talk about some more modern games? Sounds good. Welcome back to the podcast. So we're gonna talk about some more contemporary RPGs here and get to some Boulders Gate 3 chatter as I know Matthew's been playing that. Actually Jeremy, I forgot to ask you, have you been playing it?

Jeremy
58:54
I have, yeah, yeah. I've uh I've played about a day's worth of it. Um I've kind of chose not to review it. I feel like it's a game I'm gonna be playing over months and years rather than days and weeks. Okay. But uh yeah, yeah. We can definitely get stuck into that game.

Samuel
59:11
Okay, good. Yeah, I think people want to hear our takes on that. So we'll uh yeah, let's um talk a little bit more about the genre we'll get to that. So Jeremy, is there a specific game or moment when RPGs take on a more modern form and take a step closer to becoming action games rather than just RPGs? Is is Morrowind like the the the key turning point here or does it happen a little bit later?

Jeremy
59:30
This Morrowind and this Knights of the All Republic but I guess um Mass Effect is the biggie, right? Right. That's where they incorporate Gears of War essentially into the RPG, which nobody had attempted to do anything like previously. And RPGs sort of finished their transition from uncomfortable halfway house with turn-based elements to Um this is something with sort of deep storytelling and companions and all that stuff that comes from Boulders Gate 2, but it is a comfortable console action game at the same time. For me Mass Effect was a fun but also kind of like moment of loss where I kind of noticed everything having come from the starting point of Boulders Gate. It felt like a a moment of taking stock of like uh everything that's been stripped out up till this point and um you know Bioware had done this amazing um sort of encounter design for these battles where you would pause and You'd get absolutely flattened by your opponent and then you would go away and like prepare spells to counter them and then you know, live out these very tactically deep fights. Whereas in Mass Effect it's like, okay, this is a fairly average version of what's happening in third person shooters. And we've kind of turned our back on this this very sophisticated thing that we'd worked out before. Um that's not how I feel today because those things live elsewhere, but at the time there was no indie space, there was nowhere but the mainstream for RPGs and they'd become this big budget, very impressive thing, but there wasn't room for D D depth and like interactivity in the environment that people like Larian were really invested in. It just wasn't happy.

Samuel
01:01:23
Do you think that Mass Effect kind of dooms Dragon Age as well? Because I think EA acquires Uh Bioware uh around the time of the original Mass Effect, and so but and Dragon Age Origins is already in the post basically, and then They release it, it comes to console in a slightly awkward form, but that was kind of like the last vestige of, you know, the old bioware basically, and then Dragon Age 2 becomes something closer to Mass Effect in terms of being an all-out kind of action game. Do you think that the success of MassFect is basically seals the fate of um of Bioware making those sorts of games?

Jeremy
01:01:55
Maybe, yeah. Like it you know, if you've played Dragon Age Origins you know what Baldur's Gate 2 is like, like it's very faithful to that experience. Um in how the world works, what the companions are like and for the most part how the combat works as well. And Dragon Age, you know, that first Dragon Age really was a hangover of like, I remember checking the Bioware site regularly for Dragon Age updates in like I wanna say like 2005 or something like that. It's maybe too early, but like at a point where No, no maybe earlier than that, where Neverwinter Nights was recent history. And it was like what's the next step for Bioware to to build on on these D and D type things? And they'd sort of, you know, they weren't leaning on the D D license anymore, they were building their own world for it, but you could see it was the continuation of of this stuff. And that's that's what Origins was. But then after that, yeah, it's kinda like Dragon Age is a really weird series where it's never had like an easy sequel. Do you know what I mean? Like every time it's had this painful reinvention. And um I think is it Mike Laidlaw, who was in in charge of a lot of the Dragon Age stuff at the time, described that development team as like a roaming pirate ship. And you can really feel that. It's like every time a Dragon Age game has come out, you're like, okay, it's a completely different thing again. Like th there are lots of different that you know, lots of elements that connect them together. But um Origins never had its like um post-Balders Gate moments where there were you know Icewood Dale or what have you. It just it was itself and then yeah it was sort of back to the drawing board to to come up with a way to um um to follow it up Uh I think partly because EA didn't give Bioware any time to make Dragon Age 2. It's like they made the first one over several years and then the second one in 18 months or something like that. So like, okay, we have to radically reinvent this. keep it to one location which you know is a very smart idea if you know you can't do the same thing again with the time you have.

Samuel
01:04:02
But it does obviously have have consequences in terms of the the scope of that game and um lots of Hawk's life events occurring in one warehouse by the docks basically.

Jeremy
01:04:12
So yeah, yeah. And the combat in that game does like at the time was controversial because it it kind of severed its ties with the the D thing that had been in in Baldur's Gate.

Samuel
01:04:24
Yeah. I was always curious to know what console players who never had any exposure to older RPGs made of Dragon Age Origins because you look at it running on three sixty and it looks like quite an ugly game and it's and then you c get to on PC and you scroll out with the wheel and you're like, well this is how it's actually meant to be seen. You're not meant to be over the shoulder all the time looking at this. You're meant to be able to like see everything and move around the map and and get a like a a bird's eye perspective of things. It wasn't made to be looked at like it is massive

Jeremy
01:04:55
effect basically but that's what the console version kind of did so uh yeah yeah and it it felt on console more like a continuation of like the Knights of the Old Republic thing because of that perspective. and you're you could kind of hop between the characters you could were controlling but yeah it wasn't that sort of like tactical overview. that you associate with Baldur's Gate and stuff like that. And yeah, it was a very muddy, quite ugly game for the time. Like it was almost a hit despite some quite severe and obvious drawbacks, I think. Sorry Matthew.

Matthew
01:05:32
Because When you play it with a PS5 controller, like the default move, it it's a lot more like Dragon Age on console. Yeah. It pulls you like right down into the game. And actually it' It just having like direct control over that character, it feels like a very different game. I mean the difference is you can pull the you can zoom out basically and if you want to you can you can play with a uh analog stick guided uh cursor control um so it's like best of both worlds but it is it is wild what uh what a camera shift and oh yeah slightly different mode of of of character movement can do to a game in terms of like just how you perceive the whole thing. It's yeah. quite quite interesting. I'm interested to see where people land on that in terms of how they feel about the the PS5 version.

Jeremy
01:06:20
If I I I never sorry, I never quite um finished Dragon Age Origins on console because There's a story moment right before the final battle where you can lose a companion permanently, which is very Baldur's Gate 2, by the way. um but i had that happen and then in the final battle which takes place over quite a like splayed out area I needed like I needed my characters to stay in certain positions to hold them and they just wouldn't do it. It's on console, it's like, oh you're playing this character, therefore the the AI controls the others and at a certain point they'll just sort of come back towards you and I I was very like conscious of the fact that I was like, if I was playing this on PC, I'd be able to finish this fight and now I can't.

Samuel
01:07:05
Yeah, I think um I struggle through it because Uh the bit is it the lands meet that occurs before the final battle, Jeremy? Yeah. That was a an absolute fucking disaster for me. That everyone turned on me and I was like, okay, I fundamentally did not understand this game and have now completely fucked it and then I just remember it being me fighting the whatever the big dragon was called, something, spawn, something like that. I can't remember now. But Um I just stood very far away with a bow and arrow, which I hadn't had any like upgrades in because I've been focused on melee combat, but that was pointless because against the dragon it was just gonna fuck you up at close range. just for two and a half hours firing piddly arrows from a distance to try and kill this thing. And I thought I'm I it was such an underwhelming end to an epic adventure where I had treated it firmly like Mass Effect where I was it completely invested in the companions and developing those relationships with no real perception of what was going on in the larger arc or the or um or the progression systems. So I just yeah, I just remember thinking, how could I've completely shat the bed in the last 10% of this game. Yeah, here we are.

Jeremy
01:08:15
Firing your 200th arrow, like if I'd been a better politician, I wouldn't be here right now.

Samuel
01:08:20
Yeah, exactly. If I'd have even been aware of the the concept of uh of what was going on at the lands meet, maybe this would be so bad. Um So I suppose like Jeremy you've we've kind of talked about it there already a little bit, but you have Elder Scrolls and Fallout and the Witcher in their modern form setting like sort of like a new bar in terms of popularity of this genre, but obviously the form of what they are changes quite a lot and they've merged in some ways with the open world genre at the same time. What do you make of that as a development for the RPG as someone who felt like Mass Effect turned its back on something you were quite invested in.

Jeremy
01:08:55
Yeah, I mean it it kind of it makes sense to a degree where like you look at the original Boulders Gate and Fallout and they are sort of open worlds like patchwork of like discrete areas that you visit but like you can go in any direction on this kind of uh overworld map. So that's always been part of the fantasy of these games. But obviously the form that they take in The Witcher or or Fallout is is very different. And I love those games, like, for what they are. Um, they're brilliant. But um yeah, it's I I feel like it's not necessarily a net gain for RPGs to have gone open world. you know, it's um these are games which are supposedly about how, you know, the decisions you make with your character in in the world change things. And when the hundred and fifty hour open worlds There's necessarily a bit less of that. Like there's there's more pressure on developers to create content to fill the whole thing. And I think very few players, to be honest, go back and try like a second playthrough. Like it's just not really realistic. So you you do lose some of that element of choice and consequence. Like the difference between Witcher 2 and Witcher 3 where You can't you couldn't have that second act of The Witcher 2 that, you know, splits into completely different um parts. Um you can't have that in an open world because that doesn't make sense like you've got to fill two different areas of the map instead and have them both available to the player at one time.

Matthew
01:10:36
So I think someone will eventually do that and it'll be mind blowing.

Jeremy
01:10:40
Yeah, yeah, and it'll probably be Larian. Uh but yeah.

Matthew
01:10:43
Yeah, d well the di when I talked to the Dy and Light Two guys for the edge cover feature, they they were very much into like you know, the Witcher Two is kind of like the s the gold standard for us in terms of like you know, audacious consequences and we wanna do that in our open world city and they definitely had uh I don't know if you've played Dying Light Two. Oh yes of course you have to you yeah. Um, you know, there are a couple of things where like big regions can change, but uh they I I actually felt like They came sort of so late in the game and the actual change didn't really amount to a huge amount. Like it was visually like quite a l quite a lift which was impressive, but I didn't feel like you know, like mechanically or narratively, much was going on with that.

Jeremy
01:11:29
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. It didn't quite come off in Dynight 2, did it? But like there are some really impressive moments where allies become enemies and stuff like that. Yeah.

Matthew
01:11:38
I feel like Well like when you you you can reveal that like sunken region of the map.

Jeremy
01:11:43
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean on that note it feels like the real sort of positive of RPGs going open world is that it's connected them more to the other kind of leading genres of of the day and um You know, when when Assassin's Creed decided to become The Witcher, like that's a very significant moment. And um and I think now when developers make open world games there's a lot more onus on them to invest in writing teams and deep world building and dialogue and That's happened because of uh Western RPGs going open world, I think. You know, it's happened because of the Witcher 3. uh and like that is a that is a gain for for all of us I think in what like in how open world games are to play Um and it's much better than that period in the noughties where everyone just tried to copy Knights of the Old Republic and have binary moral decisions. uh at the end of their action games like this is a much more uh substantial and a meaningful addition.

Matthew
01:12:48
Army of two kill the was it not what was the animal yeah you could kill an army of two I don't know.

Jeremy
01:12:53
Do you remember that?

Matthew
01:12:55
The Army of Two sequel had like a had like moral decisions throughout it and there was one where you had to like it was like do you kill this like endangered elephant or not in a zoo?

Jeremy
01:13:06
Sounds very avoidable, doesn't it, really? It's like I choose not to go to the zoo.

Samuel
01:13:13
Yeah, it's true. Like I think getting to the end of the force unleashed two, and then I think you can choose to either go Jedi or Sith, and then like one of the choices mean makes a clone of you who is a Sith turn up and kill your main character, I think. That was squad fun. Um very strange time. So I do agree that it's uh the investment in world building is um is better than um is better than arbitrary choices even if i don't necessarily read every codex entry that comes as part of the that world building. Um yeah. So I suppose Jeremy, something else that happens in the early part of the twenty tens is a spurt of Kickstarter and crowdfunded projects that tap into nostalgia for the Infinity Engine era, starting with well I suppose this is this is like a a you know, years before, but Wasteland 2 was the first of these games, but then Pillars of Eternity was the um was the big one from Obsidian. Why was this era of revival so short-lived and why were there limited successes in this space.

Jeremy
01:14:08
Yeah. Yeah, it's an i a very interesting one because it felt like it did sort of open up um the indie space for RPGs. Um but yeah to look at a developer like Obsidian where it almost felt like everyone knew the the sort of platonic great obsidian game like what it would be but they were always as a a big contractor like in conversation with publishers it's always like a negotiation of what they could make and how polished they could make it. Um and then it felt kind of like at that moment like, oh my God, like they've got this direct connection with players um and so they can they can make this classic RPG you know this is the the developer that grew from Black Isle and Icewind Dale and and here they are doing it again. I guess wasn't what wasn't immediately obvious to us at that point was that Players in a kickstart scenario are their own publisher in a way. You know, they are their own stakeholder with their own strong set of opinions. And Josh Sawyer has talked about Pillars of Eternity since and you know he directed those games and did a fantastic job. But he's somebody who has worked on you know, he worked on these games back in the nineties, on the Icemandale games. on that cancelled Blackhound game and has lots of ideas of how you would push that form forward. And Pillars of the of Eternity was not the place to do that because the pitch was nostalgia. Because Uh you know, understandably players who opted into that, they wanted everything to resemble Boulder's Gate. They wanted it to to function in the same way and you know, they like Obsidian had an implicit mandate to fulfil that and not take it forward. Um and I th I think that's part of why you know Pillars of Eternity II was not a hit. And I think people, you know, human beings, we don't always know we think we know what we want, but uh if we can actually sort of uh state that desire very specifically and then we get it and then we're like okay well I've sort of had my fill of that now Um there wasn't really I think like the appetite was was pretty much stated like surprisingly quickly. Um and yeah. I feel like the really interesting game from that period is Tyranny, which is the I guess that was the Icewind Dale 2 Pillars' Boulder's Gate, and that it used the same engine. but took it in a different to a different place. Like Tyranny is quite a short RPG and it's set in a very unusual world where essentially Sauron has already won and uh you are like a a kind of lowly lieutenant in his army. It was almost almost like a sort of Judge Dredd figure. I'm mixing a lot of references here, but hopefully hopefully they're useful. But yeah, like it's your your You're living and working in like an evil bureaucracy. And you're basically if you want to be good in that world, you're finding small acts of good which you can kind of sneak through. Um because that's not really your job. You know, you're supposed to uphold this um this state, which is um this sort of Horrible centralized monster. Then uh and there are all sorts of weird little interesting stories in that game like You know, you find merchants who are in trouble because one year they're they're allowed to sell grain and then the command comes down the next year and they've got to sell steel And they're like, well, I don't know how to get steel, so I'm I'm I'm stealing it from somewhere. And then you have to decide whether this guy gets in trouble. And um really fascinating companions too. Like there's one guy who um is a soldier who'd been caught in a storm um create a magical storm created by this Sauron figure. I think they're called edicts in the world. and um he's been trapped inside his armor and so there's a kind of side quest of the game where you're you're trying to figure out whether you can help get this guy out of his armor and he lives inside it constantly and it's established that it stinks. Like he's just like sealed in. And uh like that that couldn't happen in Pillars because it's like it's gotta be kind of forgotten realms E D but it was really interesting to see what Obsidian did when they could kind of let loose with that form and do something brave with it. Yeah, that's the that's what the that's what the people want it turns out. Um but yeah. Um so I I feel like, you know, there were there were sort of long-term gains from that period. Like it sort of helped establish the the sort of pipeline of modern isometric RPGs and now you have like the Pathfinder games and uh it's Alcat who make those right and they they're doing this Warhammer one coming up. Oh yeah, Rag Shrever. Yeah, yeah. That's amazing.

Matthew
01:19:25
Have you played the Pathfinder games?

Jeremy
01:19:26
No, I haven't. I feel like they're very much in the lineage of like the Infinity Engine stuff, right?

Matthew
01:19:32
Yeah, yeah, I I must admit I I I bounced off them. They're they're very hardcore. Like the rules are quite complicated. Like just the the the character creation in the first Pathfinder game is What one of the most terrifying things I've experienced in a video game where it was asking me to make so many decisions about things I had no idea like what was going on. I think you'd have to like play many hours of that game just to to understand the kind of thing you would need to then go back and remake in character creator. Yeah. Um but it almost felt like because uh Uh because there's this like more mainstream RPG scene, which is like well fed, which has simplified things, it almost allows you to go. like double down on this really hardcore you know it's it's just a rule set tran translated to a game again but there's like no fear of going like f all in on it which Um, you know, it's admirable. I just I just wish it could they could somehow tutorialise that better because I've I've only heard good things about both those games. Apparently the second one's got absolutely amazing like power curves for its classes like You are absolutely godlike by the end, which I'd love to see. Um, but yeah, God knows how I will ever learn to pass.

Jeremy
01:20:49
Yeah. There's the um the Shadowrun games as well, right? The modern uh trilogy I think they are. Um and they're very good as well. They're they kind of more towards the like planescape torment end of things where it's very dialogue and prose driven and the combat end is there's like a turn b based combat system but it's it's more simplified on a systemic level but those are very good games as well which feel feel like they sort of um you know were came out of that era where it became acceptable for people to make uh isometric uh Western RPGs again.

Samuel
01:21:27
I suppose with that in mind, Jeremy, do you think there's now quite a healthy space for RPGs outside of the mainstream and uh and not just being nostalgia plates? Do you think that you can now access a pretty wide range of stuff if you have the appetite for it.

Jeremy
01:21:40
Yeah, I think it's it is in a good place where it's like it's not even just that you have the mainstream and uh then sort of nostalgic things that that recreate the nineties. Like this month there's a game called Stray Gods that's come out right or is about to come out which is written by David Gaider of uh Baldur's Gate and Dragon Age Fame. And that's a musical. That's like an RPG musical and you have like Mass Effect style dialogue wheel choices to make and they impact on the kind of uh on the on how the songs go ahead and like that isn't um you know it it doesn't fulfill all of the usual expectations of a of an RPG and it it probably I would imagine doesn't have like an inventory system where you can become over encumbered and yet it is you know rooted in that Western RPG history and uh and taps into some of those wants. Um there's also stuff like like Banasaga, which is older now, but like I thought that was a really cool series in that it felt like it felt like a full RPG even though it didn't have like free exploration and uh, you know, traps and an inventory and all these things which were expectations of the genre at one point it it still managed to like create the feel of going on that kind of adventure and then just kind of lean into the dialogue and choice and combat end of things Um so I I really I really like that it's becoming a more free-form space uh slowly.

Samuel
01:23:23
Yeah. a sort of like uh less predictable element to them and that's become a bit of a hit and yeah, it does seem like even compared to ten years ago, which is basically around the time they were making pillars, that things are just in a in a much better state.

Matthew
01:23:41
So I I um I don't fancy the chances of the musical RPG much with our Discord crowd because they were all talking about how they watched the musical episode of Star Trek and they were just like Just skip the sauce.

Samuel
01:23:54
That's a pointless a pointless exercise. I I must admit I am dreading this. Me and Matthew were talking about this the other day over pizza, but I feel like the musical episode of a T V show has been a diminish on diminishing returns ever since that Buffy episode. Yeah.

Matthew
01:24:08
So the Buffy one is great, but I thought the musical episode of Star Trek was pretty good. Okay.

Samuel
01:24:13
Can Anselm Mount Sing?

Matthew
01:24:15
Uh yeah, he can sing all right. They've got a they there's obviously a couple of the members of the cast that are like proper good singers. Yeah. Like their security officer and Uhara can can Uhura can both sing so they have quite a lot and I'll tell you who can't is the um the is it Doxar and Benga Okay I now want to watch it to see He does not have a lot to do in that episode. Is it has he got some spoken word kind of like uh very auto-tuned stunk on the guy, but it just made me laugh. Like if I was on a cre if I was on the cast of a crew uh show and they're like there's gonna be a musical episode I'd be like fu I'm so fucked.

Jeremy
01:24:56
The uh the the Grey's Anatomy musical episode I remember being I don't know. I think that was not hateful.

Samuel
01:25:03
I don't remember exactly, but uh can't think of anything I'd rather watch than Gray's Anatomy musical episode because What's wrong with a man singing suicide?

Jeremy
01:25:14
Through a surgery, Samuel. I don't see anything uh yeah unfortunate about it.

Samuel
01:25:18
I've seen I've seen the scrubs one, I've seen they're very similar. But yeah. Yeah. Okay, go yeah, Stray Gods uh I'll look out for that um David Gator and it a super interesting guy. So okay. Right then, so let's get to the Larian a little bit here. So where do they slot into the history of RPGs, Jeremy? What's their journey in parallel to all of what we've been discussing?

Jeremy
01:25:38
Yeah, it's really interesting because for so long they're just sort of chasing Out of necessity what the trends are. Like from the beginning, Sven Vinker and his team have this like desire to recreate Ultima 7 and build on it and have these really Um you know, the thing that Ultima 7 and and the later Divinity games have in common is this sort of really dense world where you can pick up every item and use keys on doors and like there's this it just feels like there's a real sort of uh immersive sim like um simulation to the world and you know for the majority of Lorien's history that wasn't really feasible for them to get made. Like in the beginning they're like told you need to be making Diablo. And then by Divinity 2, they're like, well, it's the era of uh Knights of the Old Republic to Mass Effect and you have to mold to that form. Like they had to make a big 3D game and in the course of that lose a lot of that sort of systemic nuance and it's only really when the Kickstarter age happens that they get to reset things a bit. And um I think even with Divinity Original Sin, at a certain point they were still working with like a Diablo style combat system. And Svan Vinker was uh had a sort of shower moment where he was like, why are we still it's almost like the the publisher in his head that was still telling him what to do. It's like, we don't have to do this anymore. And that was when they switched to this turn-based combat system, which has proven really popular and they like they became started to become their the kind of full selves for the first time. So it's yeah, it's this fascinating journey of a developer who always really knew what they wanted to make But were just beholden to the winds of the genre for so long that they were really just surviving until they could make it.

Samuel
01:27:39
Oh. That's interesting. Then it feels like the original Sin games mark maybe a step up in in how those games are perceived and their levels of popularity. Like what do you think they either brought to RPGs or brought back into prominence that have maybe been forgotten by other games in the genre? Is it Like you say, maybe it's the approach to turn-based combat, or is it like maybe a reactivity that people wanted from RPGs they weren't getting elsewhere? What what is it do you think?

Jeremy
01:28:05
Yeah, there's almost a kind of like simulation reactivity that had been lost where like if you play something like Witch of Three you make all your choices in dialogue And you know, all the systems that there are are very sort of ring fenced. It's like you're in combat mode, you're in talking mode, and um And that's part of how you make a very polished AAA game is to like sort of limit the eventualities that could make your game look funny or go wrong. Um whereas Larian really lean into all that stuff and having like the kind of thing like in the original Baldur's Gate simple example of like There's a lock chest. You can pick it. If you don't have anyone who can pick it, you can use your sword to break it open, and the mass will calculate that for you, and you still find another way in. And like Lyrine is Lyrene's uh games since Original Sin are full of moments like that where there's just uh They just they just go well out of their way to support all these kind of possible connections where one of your characters can be in dialogue mode speaking to a character and another of them can go off and sneak around the back and pick the pocket of the person you're talking to while it's happening. And that's just like I think that's mind blowing to RPG fans who have grown up with these much sort of stricter um play spaces where you don't get to to muck about in the same way. Like there's a An incredible moment I had in Original Sin 2 not that long ago where to get out the first act you have to get past these horribly like Crucified warped people who just kind of scream and destroy you if you attempt to to pass them is horrific One of the ways you can get past them is acquiring these wands which kind of suck the the magical source power out of these these poor crucified people and so you can leave. And I I think I acquired one of these once, but then found another way to get off this this island in the first act. And then during the second act I had a boss fight where there's um it's like an evil dwarf, I think, and he there's a point where he's he's kind of on the verge of like a transformation into this uh this horrible boss creature and Using that wand, um I was able to to prevent him from doing that. So this wand that was designed for a specific quest in the first act. I'd like I managed to remove this boss through like a convoluted like process of like teleporting him multiple times via three or four characters to like take him away from his sort of boss area and his minions. And then like there was like a nearby corpse where the boss could like pull source power from it and so I used the one to drain the power from that corpse so that he then couldn't metamorphosi and then killed him much more easily. I'm like, how on earth has this developer thought to like make sure that this particular wand, which was never really supposed to be in the scenario I'm using it? can then be used to, you know, beat a boss in a completely different area. Like it's an absolutely mind-blowing sort of um systemic connections in that game. It's quite a quite a sort of uh convoluted story. I hope that was possible to follow. But um yeah it's that Those kind of moments in the Larian games which you don't get anywhere else at all.

Matthew
01:31:36
Uh yeah, I I would add to it, like, in that kind of sort of immersive simminess which sort of speaks to a certain m like set of people who are quite good at getting creative with thoughts and there are other people who, you know, you put me in front of a dishonoured and I actually play it quite conservatively. I'm not a very, like, imaginative thinker in terms of like Well, you know, I could go out of my way to do this more complicated thing. And I think one of the things Larry did really well in both Divinity and and U Original Scene One and Two is they put a lot of that reactivity like quite on the surface. Like it's quite hard to miss. Yeah. So y you're you're kind of almost forced to play with it. You know, you you don't really discover that you can like set you know, oil on fire, like it probably will happen, or like you electrify water and it kind of takes the kind of reactivity that you might have to discover in another game, puts that up front. But then, you know, that kind of a awakens the idea of well there might be more beyond that and there is more beyond that. And it it it's one of the more successful examples I've played of a game which has sort of shown you the route into its more creative thinking. Yeah. Where I think sometimes in other games you're i th that that's either locked out or you don't really see the point of it. But Um yeah, that's I that that was a big part of it. And also just like their dedication to like if this thing is a you know, like that one thing's a perfect example, but they have a lot of mechanics where like Well if this is the rule then we have to make sure the rule holds up for the whole game. So Yeah, that's that whole if you can talk to animals, you can talk to all animals and they've all got to have something to say and there has to be meaningful you know, meaning to that or you know i if you can ki if you kill someone and then bring them back to life as a ghost, if everyone can come back as a ghost and then you can interact with that ghost, what does that mean? They just follow their thinking through. Um so it's kind of this like It's this one-two punch of like systemic reactivity, which is, you know, yeah, very systems-based, but also like writerly craft of knowing where like they have to catch you and like where the words need to be.

Jeremy
01:33:43
Yeah, definitely. I know I agree that like I don't think original sin even lets you succeed without getting to grips with that kind of reactivity. Like you can't you can't win in combat without combining the elements in in clever ways.

Matthew
01:33:58
And some some people don't like that about it. You know, they say it's like gimmicky But actually like if if I if I if I wasn't forced to do it, I wouldn't do it. N I know myself, I know I wouldn't do it. And then I just wouldn't be playing with like half of what the game has to offer. Yeah, yeah.

Jeremy
01:34:16
And it's not uh also like these games didn't arrive perfect. Like the first original sin, the writing in that is I think it's good, but it's like it's sort of uh uh almost annoyingly playful, it's sort of like illiterative and sorts of wordplay and stuff and I think you know by the time Original Sin 2 comes around and that really is like a mega hit like a a genuine steam mega hit Like they've they've nailed down some of the more frustrating elements better by that point.

Okay, which I I suppose brings us to Boulders Gate 3. So I suppose like the big question is what does this represent? Both of you I'm asking you asking this, but what does this represent in the history, the evolution of the RPG, but also in the evolution of Larry's RPGs?

Jeremy
01:35:05
It's a it's a great convergence moment, I guess. Like it's I still don't really believe it's happened. Like it's it's the connection of these these sides of the Western RPG that previously thought couldn't be connected, you know, all the kind of sacrifices you make from Mass Effect onwards to have a cinematic RPG which has full voice acting and is very satisfying in that Polish triple A way. Baldur Skate 3 makes none of those sacrifices. Like it has all of that immersive sim. reactivity, it has all of those animals who will speak throughout the game. Um and to make that happen, Larian is like it's not like a 450 person studio plus support studios. Like they've just funneled all the success from the original SYN games into extending the like lack of compromise to just triple A levels and nobody has ever done that before. Like it is unprecedented. And um, you know, as I I think Zalavia Nelson, the the very wise developer pointed out on Twitter, like it's not something we can expect from other developers. Like it's not really you know, who don't have this deeply held design philosophy and the funds that Larry and do, like it's not going to be the new standard, but I do think it will be hugely influential because it sort of brings together that hardcore um parallel string of RPGs with the triple A side um without you know Taking away any of the key elements. Yeah, that's the Omni game. I just can't believe it exists.

Samuel
01:36:57
It feels like the only real comparison point is I guess like CD Project with a Witcher 3 moment, but they had a completely different intent with what they they they did with that stepping up, you know, to the bigger canvas kind of moment. So Yeah, like I say the idea that they they're holding on to specific philosophies too and and making that leap at great expense is is is unprecedented and yeah like as pointed out not going to be replicated. So Super unusual. You two have been playing it. Let's talk a bit about your experiences so far. So I think you both played about the same amount, about a day's worth of the game. Um Matthew, how are you finding it so far?

Matthew
01:37:34
Yeah, great. I mean I I played, you know, a decent chunk of it in early access for various coverage, so I kind of I I'm not out of what I've already quote unquote seen in early access. Like it it is quite substantially changed. Um so I'm still in the first act. Um, but I'm kind of like playing with characters and companions I hadn't played before and a lot of it for me me has been, you know, covering this game and interviewing them. There's there's been a lot of like excitable hints at things to come and like writers desperately wanting to tell you about such and such, or Sven is like an amazing salesman himself. Like he's very good at like this character's got this mechanic which we've never done before and I can't wait for people to see it. So part of it's been me just sort of trying to sort of uh fill in all the gaps and all the kind of ambiguities. Yeah, I I think it's pretty amazing. I n I I not a D and D person, so it requires some knowledge to to maybe get like everything out of it. You know, I find myself having to kind of like look up quite a lot of stuff online still. But um now I'm over that initial hump. What I really love is is that exactly that thing I said with Divinity. It's it's that kind of like collision of the emergent with the authored in a really interesting way. Like the fact that it has a lot of stories and a lot of things that can happen in different places. So it's it's it doesn't feel too scripted, it feels very organic, and sometimes different events can happen at the same time in ways that they couldn't possibly have predicted that they would. But kind of makes them even more kind of chaotic. I'll give an example and this has got some very light spoilers for some like early character stuff, so apologies. Oh you can skip ahead two minutes, Jeremy, you can't unfortunately. Uh yeah. So hopefully not spoiling anything massively for you here. One of the new companions who wasn't in the the early access is this um uh tiefling called Karlac. Is that is that is Tiefling the right word?

Jeremy
01:39:26
Yeah, like the the sort of demonic um influence.

Matthew
01:39:29
Sort of human demon type, not not out and out demon. And you meet this this character and they're on a bit of a revenge mission. When you complete the first stage of their revenge mission, they basically like lose their shit and um this like stat gets imposed on them called unbridled fury which basically means they they just go on a fucking rampage they basically like leave your party and just start running around smashing the shit out of everything they see in the site, uh maybe including you. And so that's all playing out and I was like, oh my god, what's going on here? And she was just setting everything on fire because she's like a demon, she's covered in flames. At the same time, in the fight which triggered that, the wizard in my party, Gale, had died. And Gail, again, not to spoil his backstory, he ha there there is something about him where if he dies, it's quite bad news for like everyone. And this situation suddenly emerges that you have to kind of deal with. And Like obviously they couldn't predict those two things would happen at the same moment or in the same fight, but like the panic of like oh fuck Karlax's going out of our mind and then all of a sudden there's this bloke going, Oh, I need you to do something really complicated or something die is gonna happen And you couldn't have scripted it better, but they didn't script it. You know, that's that's the beauty of it and i i you know, that's just like one moment of like tens that I've already had where just the the particular character that I brought or the particular combination of companions or the the angle that I approached a certain situation, like the way the game kind of like gave me, you know, close to a a scripted experience, even though I kind of devised it myself. Like that sort of feels like like holy grail stuff on a level. you know, of of like that's that's what you want interactive storytelling to be, like a story which feels you know, oft often w when things are like very reactive or emergent, they like lose specificity in the process. And this like absolutely doesn't like that's You'd think it was the that way for everyone. It's that polished and it looks that good and it plays out so satisfyingly. Like it's um that's like quite an astonishing achievement. Yeah. Yeah. How about you how about you, Jeremy? How are you finding it? I hate it so similar to you, Matthew.

Jeremy
01:41:57
It's like I haven't seen any new quest lines or areas that I hadn't already seen in early access and previews but um already there's there's clearly a lot new about them. Like um you know, when I went on a press trip to to Ghent that you were also on, but we unfortunately had no crossover on whatsoever.

Matthew
01:42:19
You missed that you missed out on source game.

Jeremy
01:42:22
I really enjoyed hearing that like trip from another perspective. It was like getting a getting a second episode which where the events play out from uh different videos.

Matthew
01:42:32
Um but yeah it's very very Bordersgate three in that same same trip to very different experiences.

Jeremy
01:42:39
Yeah, and like I my sort of guide on that trip for playing through a chunk of the game was uh a writer called Crystal Dring, who Crystal Dring, sorry, and she um she works at the Guildford office in uh Lyrine's Guildford office, which I didn't know existed up until that point. But her and her team, like, they've spent a couple of years just sort of like As far as I can tell, just sort of adding more and more possible bits of writing that can happen based on who your character is, like what species you've picked and what class you picked and what decisions you make in the course of the game. So like I think I heard at one point like that first act of the game has like a third more writing again. without, you know, having kind of expanded out with loads of new quests and stuff. It's just like this there's more and more under the hood to enable that kind of Reactivity to a degree where it feels like you have a DM in the room with you who is just kind of like giving you what you need based on your decisions. And that is a wild thing. Like I've never experienced that to that degree in um in an RPG. Like it's the kind of thing that Obsidian have always shot for. But I don't think I've ever had like the funds or the backing to to follow through to this degree. Um it's a wild thing. On my my new playthrough really striking thing was is just um I'm playing as a halfling and the camera angles in conversation uh which I wasn't expecting but I remember like I interviewed Sven on this recent trip and he was saying like there was a big argument early on between the cinematics team which was kind of like a lot of them have come from Telltale and they're like, you know, we need to position the camera here in this scene and then other teams would say, well, you've got this goblin on this roof who's speaking, but the player might have pushed them off that roof beforehand. Uh so you need to account for that uh in the cinematics and then just being like, This is ridiculous, like how could we possibly do that? Um but that is what they've achieved are like playing as a half thing, like Every time a a tall character speaks to me, like I'm I'm looking up at them, and I feel like I feel my position in the world very distinctly in a way that I'd haven't done in an RPG previously. I was like, oh wow, like the way that these different disciplines come together to remind you of who you've picked to be in this world at all times uh is really striking.

Matthew
01:45:18
Do you think sorry Bethy go on. I was just gonna say, yeah, it's really good. It's dead. Not a valuable contribution at all.

Samuel
01:45:27
Well I do wonder if there is maybe an element of people not being served this elsewhere by modern blockbuster games and and that being part's popularity that if you want something that is not linear and super polished that maybe this is a this is the alternative you are looking for with a s you know a similar level of investment. Do you think there is I suppose I want to try to a ask Jeremy is do you think that The popularity of this game is not necessarily just tied to the fact that Larian's reputation's been accumulating. Do you think there is a fatigue at the way that other other RPGs have been approaching, you know, similar parts of the j the genre.

Jeremy
01:46:11
Yeah, I feel like, you know, we've had a decade or two really of RPGs increasingly going Well, you you can't um, you know, start a fight with this NPC who isn't marked as hostile because that could lead to these series of consequences which will muck up this scripted quest we've got and we can't account for all that because we don't have the budget to Account for it all in 3D with voice acting and all this stuff and Valarion to just suddenly be saying yes to everything is uh is a big deal. I think also like The Bioware RPG hasn't existed for quite a while. Like, Bioware almost sort of gave up on itself. Like, you hear David Gator talk about this, like For whatever reason, at a certain point in that studio, like you would think the writers in that studio would be sort of like, you know, people taking them grapes and sort of like treating them like royalty because they are they are the reason it it is where it is. But like at a certain point when they were making Anthem it was like we don't there there was a almost a kind of lack of respect or we need to sort of turn our back on on what we've been doing. And I feel like, you know, some of some of that stuff, the good stuff, still exists in CD projects games in a big way. But outside of that, um you don't really get that sort of like big sort of companion-based storytelling from a from a sort of big budget Western RPG. um anywhere. So it feels like Larry's kind of pulling together a a bunch of very hardcore and also mainstream RPG groups who've been underserved. And it seems like it is doing incredibly well. I read that the the launch of Boulders Gate 3 on Steam was bigger than Fallout 4. Which seems to I mean confirmation required maybe, but like, whoa, if uh like to even be in that conversation is Unbelievable. So yeah, it feels like it feels like it's it has kind of tapped into a very hungry set of audiences.

Matthew
01:48:29
Sort of reassuring as well that it can do that, even though like it I would say it's still quite a hardcore game, like that thing I was saying about the not really understanding some of the DD rules and not explaining itself, like There's a lot there. I don't think it's like taken a massive leap beyond like original Sin 2 in terms of explaining itself and presenting its ideas or like tutorializing. You know, it's It's it's really really full on and there's lots of stuff you have to like figure out for yourself and the kind of things that people would say are like absolute no-nos. Um I th i like there's start I just don't know that they are. Like I feel I feel like there's a lot of like received wisdom that that gets kind of questioned every time a game like this does does really well or you know the continued from soft thing. Yeah. you know, is constantly challenging like the general difficulty discussion and and and what we think the mainstream values in games. But um yeah that can only be a good thing to kind of have something which does so well while kind of rejecting it. I mean maybe it could meet it meet them halfway. Like I st I still think there's probably a uh you know d Larry and tend to do these like definitive additions like a couple of years later and I do wonder if there's like like an even, slicker, smoother entry into this game, which would propel it even further, but it doesn't need to go much further. It seems it's already done crazy bits.

Jeremy
01:49:55
Yeah. If it kind of feels like um I don't know maybe the the level of cinema on this one is such that even if you're kind of really new to a lot of the hardcore elements, like you're you're intrigued enough to want to get to grips with it. Like it's Yeah. It feels like you know, if you've if you've grown up on The Witcher 3, you can see that it has, you know, enough of those kind of like familiar elements in how it operates, but also has these hidden depths which are Um w which you've never seen before.

Matthew
01:50:31
Maybe that maybe there's enough there to keep you going. Yeah, maybe maybe the Witcher 3 is a good example because that's that's got quite a lot of strange quirks, like the whole the drinking system to kind of re-energize and the meditation and th like there are some things which are quite distinct to that game's lore which you wouldn't necessarily grasp first time out and You know, it's also a game probably designed to be played four years. Yeah. So, you know, having those kind of depths there Um yeah, it's cool.

Samuel
01:51:05
Well, it seems like at some point we'll have to return to this game and talk about it some more, Matthew. Um where you've got to grow with it further and uh Jeremy excited to hear more about how you get on with it too. But um yes uh well thank you so much for joining us Jeremy I think it's been a It's been a really great episode and you've definitely carried us through this one. So really appreciate it. Is there anything you wanted to sort of plug or discuss um to take us out here?

Jeremy
01:51:28
Uh not especially. This has been very fun and uh Yeah, Jeremy underscore Peel on on X.

Samuel
01:51:38
Uh I'm Samuel Governor Roberts on X. Matthew, what about you? uh mr bazil underscore pesto on x. Yep and uh the podcast is back page pod if you'd like to follow us for updates on the podcast. Um I've sent Matthew a blue sky code. Did you use that code near Matthew? Oh I haven't used it yet, no, sorry. No, that's fine. Yeah, I will do it.

Matthew
01:51:59
I just need to like

Samuel
01:52:01
I get to be people's cool on online friend now, so that's that's exciting for me. And uh yeah, it's been it's been great to talk with you, Jeremy. We'll have you back on for um uh like uh uh an episode that's like super light next time. Maybe we'll do like another litigator genre thing and um have you back on for that to sort of like aid in the courtroom. Um so uh and even if you don't come along for that one, I'm sure you'll pop up as a character in Games Court next time. So you've always got that to look forward to. That'll be good. Um okay, great. Thank you so much for listening. We'll be back next week. Goodbye. Bye. Bye-bye.

Matthew
01:53:05
Would you love to live in a country where KFC was Christmas dinner? Uh I'd like to at least have the option, you know? Just It's like special. You book it in advance. People like queue up for it.

Samuel
01:53:17
Alright. Is it like any more expensive than it is here or Yeah, I th well yeah

Matthew
01:53:22
They add it they add some extra I think there's like a special cake that you don't norm that like a you know, like an equ equiv a Christmas pudding type thing. It's like a very set meal. You know, it's not like I don't think they're eating like a Tower Zinger burger.

Samuel
01:53:36
Like so I I just pictured a Tower Zinger burger but it has cranberry sauce on it. That's what I basically had it on. Not the same thing.

Matthew
01:53:44
Yeah, I I don't think so. I think it is a very specific like kind of meal. Um but obviously built from the constituent parts of the KFC menu. Yeah, yeah. Wow, okay, interesting.

Samuel
01:53:55
It's like what's the classiest meal we can build with all this trash? That's quite a design challenge that is, because you don't have a lot to work with, you know

Matthew
01:54:05
Yeah. We're gonna have it like crisps on top.

Samuel
01:54:12
Yeah. It's like uh yeah, we're gonna make stuffing out of popcorn chicken. crush that basically. You can make anything out of anything if you put your imagination to it. Yeah. You don't have like much in the way of sort of green to deal with with KFC, just a bit of lettuce basically. And like maybe a tomato. I actually I'm not sure if I've ever seen a tomato at KFC. I don't think I have. I think it might be a few of those.

Matthew
01:54:33
It's profoundly beige.

Samuel
01:54:34
It is, it is. But some days when you're in the mood for it, it's it hits the spot. So I Yeah. Yeah. I guess we should keep this in the pod. People probably enjoy it.

Matthew
01:54:43
I'll uh I'll put it on as a little a little stinger at the end.

Samuel
01:54:46
Post post credits.

Jeremy
01:54:47
Uh back when that wasn't all I heard was profoundly beige. Ye But we weren't talking about you.

Samuel
01:54:54
Yeah, we talk about your takes, Jeremy. That's all we were. Um no no no
