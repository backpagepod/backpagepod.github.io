I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, in this country, we used to make podcasts, and now we are doing so again. It has been one month plus since we last recorded together. How are you, and how has it been taking that time off to recover a little bit?
Oh, it's been nice. Well, I replaced the work of the podcast with just hellish day job work. So it wasn't much of a recovery, to be honest, but I certainly couldn't have done both at the same time.
So it was a necessity. Yeah, it's been good. I feel kind of slightly nervous, apprehensive about podcasting again.
It feels a little bit like returning to school after the summer holidays, where you haven't seen everyone, and you're like, is everyone gonna have changed? Have I changed? Do I reinvent myself?
Is it just business as usual? Should I try and be cooler this year? Did Sam change in Japan?
I don't think I changed in Japan. I think I actually lost a tiny bit of weight out there, because I was cycling a lot with my friend Lynch. You were cycling?
Yeah, I was shocked. I haven't cycled for like 15 plus years. But he lives in Hyoshi, which is actually where Final Fantasy was created.
He pointed to the building where it was created, and was like, yeah, they made it there, because there's a university there, and there's a bunch of students teamed up to basically make Square. And so, yeah, they created Final Fantasy, and there's like a coffee shop where that building is. It's very unassuming.
And Koei Tecmo have an office there. But it's basically like a commuter town in Tokyo. So to get to the station is either like a 38-minute walk, which is not that comfortable, or you can just cycle there in about 12 minutes.
So we were doing that nonstop, and I cycled around multiple parts of Tokyo doing that. So yeah, I was surprised. Yeah, you go on holiday to gain weight, not to lose weight.
But luckily the Christmas break afterwards has allowed me to probably gain like four inches on my waist after just eating Quality Street nonstop. Did the roads feel safe? Well, in Japan.
For cyclists?
Yeah, very safe. Yeah, I think it's very cycling conscious generally as a country. They've got massive, massive bike racks at the station and stuff, and it's definitely baked into their culture more than it is here.
Where like, you'd never get that... Who's that bloke who was yelling at that cyclist? You know that video where that guy is sort of like screaming at that cyclist and he chases after him and runs and falls over, and they captured it with that reverse camera on the bike.
Do you remember that guy? He was like a swearing Brummie guy. There's no like Japanese equivalent of that guy as far as I know.
It's a very like, it's a very different sort of vibe.
Whenever I see roadside memorials in Bath for bikers that got smashed, I always think that would be me if I was on a bike. They just, those things serve as a constant reminder to me why I shouldn't ever be on a bike.
Right, okay. Well, I mean, I think like the mortality rate is probably lower than you're assuming it is, but yeah, I did a bit of that.
I'd add to it for sure. Straight under it.
There's no point cycling around Bath anyway, because most of it's a hill. Like what's the point of going up and down that thing on a bike? You might as well walk it.
So yeah, unless you're going to go along the river to Bristol, that might be a nice thing to do. But you add an e-bike as well, Matthew, which basically means you do a tiny bit of pedaling, then an electric engine does the rest for you.
I see how it is.
So you would whack that bad boy up to very high settings, so it does most of the work for you. Then you're basically being chauffeured around by your bike. I think that would be a version of cycling you could get on board with.
So yeah, that's basically it. I went to Japan. That was quite fun.
It is a bit strange coming back to this, actually, because I have spent a lot of the time since I got back fretting over this list, honestly, this Game of the Year list.
Oh yeah, tell me about it.
It's stupid, right, because we are meant to just, we could just do 10 off the top of our head games that we played this year. I've definitely played more than 10 games this year. I've played something like 25, 30 games this year.
I didn't finish them all, but I finished probably a small percentage of that. But there was plenty to discuss, and yet I've fretted non-stop just to make sure the list is just perfect, just in a variety, that sort of thing. Has that basically been what your sort of recent times have been like as well?
Yeah, I know I will probably get to this when I get to the lists, but I ended up with like a huge pool of games which I liked exactly equally, you know? And so it was kind of like every game I put on, it just felt like I was shitting on another game of equal quality. And yeah, I've had about five different versions of the bottom half of this list, ranging from just like fucking insane, contrarian bullshit to the most ploddingly obvious list ever.
I just don't want it to be the same as everyone else's list, even though that's mad.
Yeah, that's it. I would say that what's been interesting this year is that outlets have basically had to say that the same 10 games are the games of the year, not because they're in cahoots or anything, but just because it's fairly self-evident what the important big games were from this year. So a lot of the best of lists have ended up being not identical, but very, very similar.
But that also means I think I've noticed that outlets have made more of an effort to do side lists alongside that, like games you might have missed or best indie games lists or even personal picks lists to try and give a wider view of the year, because it was such a big year, it was worth doing that for that reason. So that's been interesting to see how they've wrestled with it, because I do get it. It is probably, there are one or two games that I've seen at number one for basically every single list, and there's not much variety therein.
So I've been trying to avoid that myself also, Matthew. So yeah, interesting stuff. So anything else you want to ask me about Japan before we get into this episode, Matthew?
Oh, I haven't seen you since you got back from Japan. There's like a million things I want to ask you. Maybe more of a pub environment.
Okay, well, listen, because it will be of interest to people who listen to this podcast. What was the most sensational thing you ate in Japan?
Oh, gosh. Do you know what? Actually, I got taken to a ramen place that wasn't even on Google Maps.
It was just so discreet. It just says ramen in the sign above the door. But there was a queue there.
This is a hiyoshi where my friend lives. And there was a queue there. Apparently, like every single evening, it's open.
It kind of like, it can sort of, I don't think go around the block, but it gets really long. And they only have something like five tables in there. So we went and queued up 45 minutes before the place opened.
And then I had the classic Japanese ramen experience of just, you eat it, you slurp like hell. And then you're going to get out. It's a very like, it's a very different sort of dining environment to other dining environments.
And that, that was probably the best ramen I've ever had. So that was, that was up there. It was just like a bowl of like pork belly and sort of like creamy, creamy sort of broth and the fat stack of noodles.
It was, that was probably up there, but honestly, I mean, relevant to this podcast, certainly. I became obsessed with, as I think many sort of tourists do, the fried chicken they sell in convenience stores there. Basically just, it's like 220 yen.
And they give you a piece of fried chicken in a bag that you can sort of like rip and fold in half so your hands don't get greasy. Eat this like chicken, this chunk of chicken that's got no bone in it. And then like carry on with your day.
And I must have had about...
It's got no bone in it.
Yeah, you can buy a drumstick version, but it's like, it was like a chicken breast, kind of, but it also had like a bit of skin in it as well, and it was battered. So it was incredibly juicy, incredibly tender. And that was absolutely beautiful.
Some of the best chicken I've ever had. Someone tipped me off early on that Family Mart is the one that does the best of the supermarket chicken. So I kept kind of gravitating towards that.
That was excellent. And I think, again, a very touristy thing. I became very obsessed with convenience stores.
Obviously, I played the Yakuza games. So those games are great at capturing the sort of like, what are these 45 different bottles that are on the shelf and what do they all do? So I was frantically buying bottles of vitamin C jelly and all this kind of random stuff and just drinking like three of those a day, absolutely rammed with sugar.
That was great. And then also having like, I had one of the best egg sandwiches I've ever had from one of those convenience stores as well. They're apparently quite famous for that.
So yeah, on the food side, I ate extremely well. I don't think I had like, I had one slightly duff meal when I was left to fend for myself in Ueno Station when my friend was working one day. So I just went in there and ordered this quite disappointing sort of like fried pork rice dish thing that was a bit overpriced.
But almost everything else I had out there was amazing. Just meat doused in sort of like dark sauces and all kinds of amazing...
The dark sauces. You had the dark sauces from restaurants that weren't on the map. Very mysterious.
The worst thing I had actually was I went to one of their burger chains and it was really much, much worse than any of our burger chains. It was like One Piece themed. Not the entire chain, but they were running some kind of One Piece promotion.
So they had that little pirate lad on the front. I'm afraid I don't know any of the One Piece lore. I know there's a couple of people on our Discord who'll be screaming at me, as I say, the pirate lad from One Piece, because that probably describes every single character in that manga.
Staff serve things with very stretchy arms. One Piece, rubber arms.
No, it was just a very extremely... It was like having a very mediocre beef roll. I was really unimpressed by that.
Everything else I had was just... I had lots of kuraage, just fried chicken, all the time. I went to a sushi place that was in the Skytree, which is like the tallest building in Tokyo.
I went up there and took some pictures from up there. I queued up there for, I think, 45, 50 minutes just to get a seat. That was amazing, incredible sushi place as well.
Really good. I almost went to the Kirby Cafe in that same location, but you had to queue for, I think, like 90 minutes to get into the Kirby Cafe, and it did look cool, but I'm not quite enough of a Kirby head to justify that. So, yeah, that was that.
But yeah, it ate incredibly well. It was good. Would you like some video game observations about Tokyo?
My follow-up question was going to be what's the nerdiest thing you saw?
The funny thing is, right, sort of like I'm actually... So, video games really do not feel anywhere near the forefront of culture there, and I think that's... I kind of knew that, I think, going into it, because you've read all these stories about all the best pre-owned games have been stripped out of a Super Potato or whatever, and also that the arcade scene had sort of died.
I remember reading a really good Simon Park in Piece and Edge, I think it was maybe a year or two ago about where that was at, and all of that is completely true. I went to Akihabara, and I've got to say that it is kind of cool at first. I found it quite growling as just this selection of shops that sell the same few anime statues over and over again.
And I think if you kind of go in expecting to find loads and loads of cool, obscure merchandise, it's not really that sort of place. You have to go really looking for it. So I bought a couple of Metal Gear figures at Nakano Broadway towards the end of my trip, and I just found those at the back of one shop, and that was the only really cool, obscure stuff I ever saw.
Everything else is kind of the same things over and over again. And then the arcades are honestly just like UFO catchers, just those machines, and then gacha machines, and then maybe you get one or two machines on the top floor of these arcades. But it's like even when I went 15 years ago when Sega World was still open and stuff like that, it just doesn't really exist.
And if you go on the train, and you're expecting people to just be sat there on the Switch or whatever, that's not true either. They're all playing Honkai Star Rail, or however you pronounce that game's name. I saw one girl with a Switch, and that was all I saw on the train.
Honestly, it's just not, it maybe used to be something that it's not now, maybe, or maybe it never existed, and this is all just a foreigner's perspective of how people talk about Japan. But a couple of people have told me if you do want to go and find some more cool, obscure merch, you have to get a bit further out of the city, so that might be true. But it was interesting in that respect, actually.
I was at my most unhappy whenever I was shopping there. I just found it completely grueling and awful. And then whenever I engaged even remotely with more cultural stuff out there, I went to go look at something cool, or things that are not related to video games, I had a more fulfilling time.
I like chicken. Whenever I engage with the chicken situation, my joy levels rose considerably.
Well, I've got a little bag of stuff for you from the Capcom store anyway. It's not amazing, Matthew. They actually had sold out of all of the good Ace Attorney merch when I got there.
I thought if I came back with one of those Nendroid, whatever those are called, those big head figures of Apollo Justice, I think you'd find that a little bit weak source. I think you wouldn't be there going, oh wow, an Apollo Justice for my desk. I just don't think that would be the response.
Is that a sort of Funko-esque thing?
Yeah, but a classier Japanese Funko basically. They had that on MyFA, and again, the energy of me giving you the MyFA one would be a bit strange, I think. But I have got you something, Matthew, so I'll give you that at some point.
But yeah, it was really good. Those are probably the top-line notes that would be of interest to the listeners.
Well, I'm sure we're going to have plenty of chances to interrogate you throughout the year about your Japan trip. I want to know about, you went to Nintendo Land, right?
No, I didn't do that in the end. No, I was thinking about it, but it was too hard to get to. And I'd had such an awful time at DisneySea in Tokyo that I didn't bother going.
I want to hear about DisneySea, that we can do that in another episode.
Yeah, okay, maybe we can talk about that in the XXL that we do next time. So, yeah, it was honestly completely fulfilling. I came back extremely knackered and quite ill, but now I'm totally recovered from it.
It does feel like it was the best possible thing I could have done, was taking that trip. So it's been good, you know? So yeah, okay then, should we do the actual podcast up here for Matthew?
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay, so, 2023, The Best Games of That Year. That's basically what this episode is then. So we have our classic preamble where we'll go over the year.
It's ups and downs, some of our personal ups and downs in there, a little bit of industry commentary, I suppose, a bit of a mix of stuff, and then we'll have two top ten lists counting down in the old Chet and John's Reassuringly Finite Gaming playlist style. And yes, we'll discuss our ten favourite games from the year. So Matthew, was 2023 a great year for games and how would you define the general shape of it?
I think it was a great year for games. I think it was the kind of payoff for, you know, things which were delayed and all the kind of chaos of the last few years has just meant everything gathered here. I think the thing I loved most about 2023 was that it seemed really consistent through the year.
Like every month there was something interesting happening and that spacing meant that I just played a lot more games this year. I feel like I could stay on top of the situation. There were definitely months and times where like five things came out at once and there are some holes in my top 10 thinking because of that.
But yeah, just this like really consistent, kind of coherent year of game releases, which I found hugely enjoyable. What a spicy take, eh?
Yeah, I'm inclined to agree. I think that, I think it's sort of in some ways. I do think there's a, this year is sort of a pile up of eight out of ten games.
Right.
But there are a few exceptions to that. But I think in general, when I was looking at the shape of my list, I was like, well, all of the blockbusters this year I played, I think pretty much all of them I felt were eight out of tens in some capacity. But I do agree that it's the pile up element of all those games coming out at the same time that made it feel like a big year, a great year.
And I do agree some of that is delays. It was just, I think it was just out of control though. And I think one thing I did feel about the year was that indie games didn't really get a look in in the way that they might typically.
And I think that I've slightly changed my mind on that in the last month as I've seen people go to bat for more stuff I haven't heard of or a couple of games emerge a little bit reputationally. But I do think that one consequence of the year is that people didn't have the same level of attention to pay to indie games. And so those games were maybe blotted out more.
And in that respect, I'm like, did indie games maybe not have the best year either in the fact that like, you know, I'm not saying quantity necessarily, but just attention or how they were able to financially perform because they couldn't get attention. So that's my one sort of caveat to that in terms of the quality of games. But let's face it, on this podcast, we very much enjoy the shiny blockbusters.
And this year definitely delivered those. And like you say, in massive quantities, there are plenty of games left from this year I have not played or finished. Matthew, I know you are so prolific that you have completed everything because that's what you do.
I really haven't. Making this list, I was like, oh man, there's all these things I haven't touched that I felt quite bad about. It's interesting what you say about the indie thing.
I think there is a big discoverability issue at the moment. And I don't know if that's down to the changing character of the internet and the kind of extreme SEO warfare that everyone's been pulled into, where there's just very little room for anything which isn't like a guaranteed hit. And everyone's...
Yes, you have all those AAA, AA, shiny, big publisher games which are obviously going to draw attention, but even within them, people swarm around certain things. There's that month where all you read about is Starfield, and if you released anything else in that month, it wasn't getting talked about just because sites and the people who would traditionally introduce you to games are so single-minded in their pursuit of those hits, because you have to be, because look at the state of things and how terrifying it all is for the industry and the media and everyone. And it's kind of hard to see how that can ever change or how that might change going forward.
This year, so much of my indie discoverability has been through a couple of people who really go after this stuff personally and are very good, have good gaming taste, who I follow on Twitter. Edge Magazine, I think they've done a really, really good job of surfacing lots of stuff which I just haven't seen written about anywhere else. I think you raised this on maybe Twitter or Blue Sky or something, this idea of the games which have 20,000 positive reviews on Steam and eight reviews on Metacritic.
And how that situation came to be is kind of crazy. And the idea that actually there is a tier of superstar games just beyond you, always. I've never felt that more than I felt that this year.
Yeah, that was an interesting one, because the game I'm talking about, spoiler alert, that game that Matthew was alluding to there, that does appear in my top 10 list, so I'll discuss that. But yeah, I thought that it was interesting to see the sort of like games that did get attention in the indie space that I then thought, oh, did these games really find like a massive audience? So the couple of examples of this, like the Invincible, a sci-fi game which looks really cool, I've not had time to play it like many games from this year, but that's one game where I think it looked like they spent quite a lot of money on it, and it sort of like came and went in a very busy time period.
And I don't just, I'm not totally sure that game found the audience it might have got in a quieter time where it didn't have as much competition. That also stands to the game Thirsty Suitors, which got loads of coverage, loads and loads of reviews, but actually has fewer than a hundred reviews on Steam, which would suggest it's been quite a niche concern, but that's not to say that that makes it bad by any means. I hope it finds its audience.
But again, what I guess I'm saying is that the time period, every time period this year, there pretty much wasn't a quiet time to release your game and find the audience that you wanted to find if you were anything less than a AAA publisher. So I think in that respect, it was a challenging year. And yeah, the element of curation, it's a good one to raise because I do agree.
You do have to go searching a bit harder to find people who are talking about this stuff. It's not, yeah, I've heard people anecdotally tell me that it's really hard to get, you know, like press to cover indie games or whatever. And, you know, like you say, there are financial reasons why these games aren't the ones that are going to make bank in terms of like traffic.
So it's difficult. And then so they're dependent on content creators. But, you know, respectfully, that's not where I'm going for my game recommendations.
So I kind of need them from other avenues. And it really is tricky. So I feel for people who are covering this stuff.
But I do also think it's cool that some of these games can like break out and find audiences and become viral sensations in themselves. That game I was talking about, which again I will flag when we get to it, is one that, like Matthew says, had nine reviews on Metacritic, which is about, I think it's like a quarter of what I saw Thirsty Suitors got. I was bored of the train when I was reading about this, but I was trying to like track the sort of relationship between press covering things and like how audiences like pick up things and talk about them.
And yeah, like it's just so murky now where you're supposed to go for recommendations, what gets surfaced. It really is just like, yeah, it's maybe never been more challenging as a consumer to read about this stuff and find this stuff. So yeah, and you and I are very engaged with games.
So we're doing our best, but yeah.
Yeah. And like every individual person's sort of perception of what's big and what's small, it just seems all our whack. I've seen videos of like big YouTube creators where they're kind of like, you know, my game here, I'm going to tell you about something, you know, a little game that I don't think any of you've heard of and it's called Juson.
And you're like, that had like huge Xbox Game Pass backing. Like that's a massive game, you know, like this. And then, yeah, the thing of like the press review it, but then no one reviews it or plays it on Steam.
And then the reverse of that, it's kind of just a really weird time.
It's a mess, really. And so, you know, it's interesting because I think that Jade's game, Cassette Beast, is one of the few indies that did break out this year. And I think he did pick like a very, a very small window in which his game did, was able to sort of take off.
It was, you know, aesthetically, a game that was a perfect fit for the Switch as well, and it was on Game Pass. So it had like definitely some advantages, but it also just, it was the idea that stood out as well. It was a thing that jumped out because people were looking for something that was a bit Pokemon-like, and therefore I think that captured press imagination.
And that's part of how you get their attention too. And yeah, it's a funny one. But yeah, it's, yeah, honestly, and that's the other thing, like there's just so many games.
It's impossible to get your arms around this year in the way that last year we found it, I think you and I found it fairly easy to get our arms around last year. We were like, we both played a bunch of Elden Ring. We both played a bunch of God of War Ragnarok.
And then we played like eight indie games. That was basically our year. And that was fine.
That was sustainable. And then a couple of Nintendo games as well. So yeah, a weird one.
Here's a question for you though, Matthew. Do you think this was the year that every console manufacturer bought something cool to the table?
I'm not sure Xbox did.
You don't think Starfield, Hi-Fi Rush, Forza is a pretty good combo?
Maybe, yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I guess Starfield was big.
They just didn't register with me. Maybe that's just due to what I'm having to do in my day job at the moment has kind of focused me a bit and I just don't play my Xbox as much as others. I just feel with Xbox that the story is Game Pass and Game Pass, while like amazing value for money, there's something a little bit shapeless about it.
In my mind, Xbox is Game Pass and Game Pass is serving up these games which are often multi-platform, multi-format, elsewhere, trying to own them in this way. It feels like a little bit like a console experience sort of riding the coattails of like other games a little bit. But then, you know, I'm not a big Forza guy and I wasn't a big Starfield guy, so maybe those factor into my thinking.
That's fair enough. I think I just sort of thought as someone who owns everything, this year, even like, you know, even owning an Oculus Quest 3, like... Sorry, I had such a burp there.
Even as someone who, you know, owns a VR headset alongside the three consoles, I just think there was like something I wanted to play on all of them. Like, I did get into Starfield. Hi-Fi Rush was a really cool surprise.
And Forza, not my sort of thing, but, you know, I assume there is some contingent of dads who like cars. You think that's like the coolest thing in the world. I'm going to go ahead and assume that they exist.
You got that. Spider-Man, obviously, on PlayStation, like a massive deal. I can't remember what else happened on PlayStation this year.
I guess Final Fantasy XVI is exclusive. So you have to count that.
PSVR 2.
Oh, yeah, of course.
If that's your back.
Yeah, like that's, you know, as a sort of piece of hardware, that's, you know, drew lots of acclaim, a real step forward for VR, for that tethered VR experience. So you have that. And let's face it, another fucking great Nintendo, yeah.
You know, Nintendo just seems to bring it every year now, you know.
But you're right in that the great year narrative, it makes more sense the easier access you have to multiple machines. You know, I don't know if there's, if you only had one of any of these things, I'm not sure if one of these platforms had a particularly like, oh my God, it absolutely like killed, and you would only need that thing in your life to be happy. Maybe, maybe in the Switch.
That is a really perceptive way of looking at it actually. You do need that broad cross-section to get the most out of it. Maybe you and I are operating from a position of privilege in that respect, because not everyone does have all those machines.
I'm sure very few people do, but I certainly, obviously games are my number one hobby, so I make sure I do have access to that. But yeah, I think that's true. If you had the Switch, you'd miss out on all of the shiny blockbusters happening elsewhere.
So you'd have things to play all year, but you would be missing out on some circles in that Venn diagram certainly.
And then on PC, you had this narrative of like port shit in the bed, you know? It's that awkward period where things are stepping up a little bit, and in terms of what people are doing graphically on consoles, and it isn't as neatly transferred. It's not that your graphics card from six years ago can still wump every game going, you know?
That always happens, there's always this slight bit where you're like, well, you're going to leave something behind because of the console generations, and I think that's happening this year. It's what I glean from Digital Foundry headlines that I don't necessarily read.
Yeah, it's true that several bumpy PC ports definitely created that narrative, and certainly as someone who used to be on PC Gamer, obviously, I used to have a gaming PC was like the center of my world, and now it's not really. I do buy games on consoles because I'll chance it on a performance mode that might not work out. But I'd rather go for that than spend another £2,000 and then still have games that might not be optimized.
Just the Jedi Survivor stuff that happened this year, that became the story of that game, those performance issues. That just seems to continually happen with PC ports for whatever reason. So I agree, there's no one place you could go to get everything this year.
You definitely had to have multiple ways to interact with this stuff. Which types of games do you think popped off this year, Matthew? Was it a week a year for any particular area of games?
I mean, a good year for RPGs, a good year for open world games, for the obvious reasons. I don't know, I feel quite well served in terms of all my genre tastes. I feel like there was a big…
if you look at… if you were to compile a list of everyone's game of the years and create a kind of soup of the top 30 games that appear on them, most genres are accounted for. You know, you've got big racing games, fighting games, strategy games, shooting games.
Yeah, I don't know. Was there something that jumped out to you as a weak spot?
No, to be honest, when I put this question to our plan, indie games were kind of what I was thinking of. But that was more the attention factor. I'm not saying that indie games were bad, but it's just that, did they get a look in, was kind of my question there.
But no, I do agree. I think, broadly, those, I think all those areas are pretty much covered and, yeah.
Yeah, it feels like you read a lot of bad stuff around like Destiny 2, say, at the moment, and that bungee may be struggling to kind of like, work out what the next step is or to transition out of Destiny 2 or create the next wave of Destiny 2 or whatever that is. Because I don't really follow games of service, they're not really a thing I play, but I haven't seen, you know, Fortnite kind of got a renewed burst from, returned to the original island, right? Isn't that its thing?
It's been around long enough that it's been able to like, reboot itself, like World of Warcraft classic style.
Plus, they've made like four new Fortnite games and then that's Fortnite now as well, like there's a Lego Fortnite for example.
Maybe there's stuff happening in that space, which, you know, has kind of, you know, has escaped me. Maybe there's some bigger narrative boiling up there. I don't know if, you know, what's going on with Overwatch and Apex Legends and all this stuff if people are still playing these things.
But you've seen that they're ticking along, right?
Well that's the other thing though, right? Is that I think that something we've seen in games in the last few years, a big backlash towards the idea of new live service games that could be not live service games and people asking why is Naughty Dog making, now they are no longer making The Last of Us as an online game, right? But four years have passed since The Last of Us 2 came out, almost four years, and there's no sign of a new Naughty Dog game.
So presumably a lot of time and energy and resources has been put into a live surface something that is no longer going to come out. And that compounded with the fact that Destiny 2 was pretty much always seen as the, you know, that's like the best case scenario for a live service game. In some ways, it feels like that dream has curdled a bit, you know, where, you know, chasing that seems to be I'm not saying it's dying a death because, you know, there are more of these games coming along, but it doesn't feel like there is room for them.
And the ones that are there are dominating and soaking up the money. So, you know, your Apex is FIFA's and Fortnite's, they are the ones making the dollar. But I don't know now if every publisher wants to sort of like pour hundreds of millions into chasing the next one of these things.
It might just be that that is not going to go anywhere. So that's a bit of speculation, I guess. But I think Destiny almost felt like that's the dream curdling a little bit is that the fact that they had to they got rid of a bunch of stuff.
And yeah, it was just and they said that it's been, you know, dropping, dropping off the amount of people are spending on it.
And I mean, yeah, if exoprime will come and keep the dream alive, I don't know what can.
That's certainly my favorite live service experience from this year, Matthew. So it's funny, though, because some of these questions I put in this plan, I came up with a month ago and I'm trying to remember what I was thinking when I asked them in here. So when I asked you about games, certain types of games popping off, I was like, what was I getting at when I put this plan, I can't remember.
So I guess, Matthew, should we talk a bit about the industry turmoil element from this year? It seems like that's probably the good point to discuss it. So it has been a really rough year financially for the industry.
There's a couple of things here. So there have been a massive amount of layoffs and at the same time there is a cost of living crisis and the two things are connected and another connecting factor is the fact that when the pandemic happened, the industry ballooned in value and drew a lot of new money and investment and now as things have come back towards what would be a normal level when people are not trapped indoors all the time, things are not necessarily working out for everyone. It's affected a lot of people's livelihoods.
I am not immune to this as well. I was in consultation this year and took voluntary redundancy, although I'm excited about what I'm doing next, which is cool. It was just a bit of...
If you read LinkedIn at all this year, it was an absolute fucking bloodbath and incredibly depressing, really tough reading. People just investing, obviously, time and energy in making it in games and progressing in games, and the industry has just been shrinking. It's really, really horrible.
It's infected the discourse of the year as it should. People have been talking about it quite responsibly, I think. The press have done their best to spotlight this, and I really credit them with that.
But I guess I don't know what else to say about it, really.
That summing up was just... That's kind of what it is, right? It may not be super obvious.
It wasn't super obvious to me. Just as you, I feel, have a slightly better read on this, being a bit more industry-side these days, and you've seen it from the inside, and can pinpoint that it is those things. There's some other stuff around it, recently there's been talks about some games' budgets have been revealed via various means, and you begin to realise just how crazy things are ballooning this generation, and the step up that comes with a new generation, and the demands of it, and people can read these things themselves, but I think there was one where it was like this thing cost three times as much as basically the same game last generation, can anyone see the difference?
And you were like, yikes, I don't think that's just, is that wasteful spending? I read more like this is just the necessity of the scene these days, this is just what it is to make a game and, you know, maybe people just have to like recalibrate completely kind of what they can expect. But then at the same time, you have something like, you know, Bordersgate 3, which is just this wild kind of homegrown success story that seems very pure.
And I'm not saying it's like, oh, this is the roadmap for all games. But you know, that there have been huge, glorious, delightful success stories amongst this terrible year as well.
Yeah, I think it's I think like some of those leaks are good in the sense that it's important for people to understand just how much games cost to make. And I genuinely don't think people really knew, you know, the best thing I've seen written about this or said about this is from Hooded Horse Inc, who basically like they just published Against the Storm, quite like a big sort of PC city builder game and they have the game Mana Lords coming out next year and they made a bunch of cool sort of like strategy game kind of stuff. So their CFO and president Snow Rui said, investors encouraged a lot of previously self sufficient studios into expanding their team and budget too much to the point where budget outpaced market potential and the studios were no longer sustainable without investor support.
When money became tight again, investors pulled their support and the studios had to downsize or even shut down. This damage could have been avoided with the more cautious approach people are starting to adopt now. And I think that is the story of the year in some ways.
There was a lot of money washing around, but there is another dimension to this as well, which is it is just more expensive to make this stuff than it used to be, which I think is what you're alluding to there, Matthew. So I don't think the pain is over, unfortunately. I think there's going to be more of this next year.
Hopefully the industry comes out of it. But yeah, these things do come and go in cycles, but certainly, yeah, like it's affected a lot of people. That's tough.
That's tough. That's tough. It is tough.
In a sincere way. That's tough.
I agree. It is tough. So, yes, but it's definitely part of the narrative of the year.
So yeah, and you know, like, that's the other thing, though, there is a correlation between the amount of money that's been invested in games and the amazing stuff we've had this year and the volume of stuff we've had this year, right? And I'm not saying this means that fewer great games will be made in future. I don't think so.
And you know, certainly, like, the pandemic was, I say, quote unquote, only, only, you know, just under four years ago, some of the stuff, the decisions that were made in the pandemic, we are, we still haven't seen the results of the games that were greenlit, that sort of stuff. So I'm sure there's like going to be a few busy years ahead. And then maybe things will recalibrate to where they were maybe like five years ago, where it's a little bit steadier.
But yeah, certainly, it's been a weird one. So yes. I suppose on a different note, Matthew, how was your year on a personal level?
How was your 2023? Was it all right?
Yeah, it was good. It was busy. I, you know, obviously in 2021, I was basically freelance for the year after the redundancy in 2020, and then I basically started work at a creative agency, working on kind of contract work.
This isn't very exciting, I'm afraid. My day job and yeah, that stepped up again this year, pulled me back into kind of YouTube, like the day to day business of YouTube. You know, I was making videos which were then getting put up elsewhere, but now I'm back involved with like channel management and things like that.
And so that's, you know, it's like having kind of got out of it on RPS, it's like being back in that like horrible mud fight again, because that's what YouTube is. And even in like, the three years that I was away, like the behavior of it's changed again, and all the things and tricks and knowledge I'd kind of built up during Xbox and RPS, you know, it's, it feels like not back to square one again, but you're kind of like, okay, well, these these little tricks don't work anymore. So yeah, I'm still kind of figuring that out.
So definitely a more intense work here. Probably beneficial to the podcast, though, just because I'm like closer to games again and having to be involved with that.
So yeah, you've been so on it this year. You've been like, you've played, you're always like, yeah, you kind of give me the low down on stuff you've been playing before embargoes left and I'm like, oh, man, he's he's probably tapped in here.
So yeah, of course, if any PRs are listening, I never do that. I adhere to all embargoes.
It's all in the DMs on the friend video.
Very, very important. No, but it was more like when I found myself back at Gamescom basically doing the journalist beat again and I was like, I kind of had no intention of ever doing this again. Not like I'm too old for this shit, you know, I'm not that old, but I'm older than I want, you know, I'm not like a 25 year old legging it around that place with like wide eyed enthusiasm.
You know, it's more like, oh shit, I've got to carry all this heavy stuff and it's really hot and I might actually die.
And then you got photographed eating big sausages, which people sent to me immediately just to let me know that you've been eating big sausages. That was important, wasn't it?
Yeah, I went out, I can't remember if I talked about this, but I went out, I left the centre to go and interview someone at a hotel and then I lost my pass. It fell off my lanyard and so I couldn't get back into Gamescom and I had to jump through all these hoops. And at this point it was just like the masses were trying to get in as well.
So trying to solve a kind of missing pass problem while also trying to get through, you know, all these sort of German teens dressed up as Final Fantasy 14 avatars. And you're like, Oh God, like I may have a heart attack in front of these people and like ruin their love of this hobby forever.
Oh, that's funny. It's weird. It was slightly, it was slightly hellish Gamescom this year and I can't quite explain why.
It was sort of, it was nice to see a lot of people I hadn't seen in a while. And also to realize just how long it had been since I've seen a lot of those people that just a real kind of passage of time element kicks in where you're like, Oh wow, it's been the people that noticeably older than when I last saw them because it's been like six years in some cases.
Yeah.
So, yeah.
I don't think a lot of PRs realized that the one free drink they gave me on their stand was the one free drink that kept me alive during those three days. Like how close I was to genuine death.
You should have flagged to me like whenever you were nearby the where I was and I would have just ran out and give me a bottle of water to keep going.
I should have developed a knock on the outside of your booth near where you were standing where if you hear this particular rhythm you just chuck a bottle of water over the wall and I catch it.
I love that. It's very video gamey isn't it? I couldn't see that.
Yeah. I like that. The only problem is there are glass bottles Matthew so I would have done some damage.
Well, I'll be good at catching. Trust me. If it's between life and death my coordination improves massively and if it did smash I'd get down on my knees and I'd suck it out of the carpet.
Good times. So yes. It was fun to get out there amongst the industry.
I really felt like the industry was back in full force at Gamescom but there was like this, I don't know, maybe it's just in my head, but a bit of a dark cloud because of all the layoffs and the bits and pieces happening but that might have just been as well because I drank beer like five nights in a row or something just to keep going so it could be a bit of both but yeah.
Yeah, although it's 2023, great, I became one of the biggest reviewers of Bath Supermarkets on Google reviews.
Yeah, that's important, both of the Sainsbury's have been reviewed now by Matthew Castle.
Tens of thousands of people have read my reviews it tells me. That's like a bigger audience than I got on NGamer have read those reviews of Supermarkets.
It's bigger than the listenership of this podcast so that's upsetting. But also, I'm very happy for you so well done. I assume you'll be launching a Patreon for your supermarket reviews any day now Matthew if people want to support that.
Yeah, the problem is once you've started reviewing Google Maps, if it detects that you're near any shop for any amount of time, it's like, do you want to review this shop? And I'm like, no Google reviews. I was just walking past that shop.
I didn't actually go in Ryman's, the stationers, even if I did, I don't necessarily have a take on it. You know, sometimes I just want some staples, you know?
Yeah. Well, the thing is, though, that's what a lot of these platforms do now. LinkedIn's like, you've been selected as one of the experts to answer this question.
I'm like, oh, that's very nice. You're going to get your hand in your pocket and pay me for this free content. That's how I feel about it.
I'm like, oh yeah, I don't work for free, LinkedIn, like that's sorry.
They ask you really inane questions as well, because they'll be like, do you want to help people by answering a question about milk buns? And then it'll be, does milk buns sell burgers? Yes, does milk buns sell cheeseburgers?
And you just end up going through the menu, the whole thing one by one and sometimes you don't know. It's a curse really. I really regret my Google review adventure.
I feel like I have these little pocket obsessions too, and all they're doing is getting me further away from completing the novel. That's like, that's all that's happening. I feel like that's all that's happening to you here, Matthew, you're in a little trap trying to get out of it.
So I wish you well in 2024 as you sort yourself out on that on that front. But yeah.
How was your year on a personal level?
Gosh. It was, you know what, while it was happening, it didn't seem that bad. And then I sort of like audited it this, as I would like took my month long break, which I was incredibly privileged to have.
I've not been, I've not had more than two weeks off since I was a teenager. So, it was really nice to be able to just have a month and think about it. And like, gosh, how much do I tell the listeners?
So someone very close to my family nearly died at the start of the year. Then someone in my family died at the end of the year. And that was not great.
And obviously, like I say, consultation, that was quite tough. But to be honest, that wasn't too bad because I kind of had a feeling I'd be able to go and do something. So that's all right, I feel very fortunate in that respect that I had some confidence I would find something or maybe that was just a bit of like unearned confidence.
But in any case, so those things happened. And I suppose like on paper, that seems bad. But weirdly, yeah, when it was happening, it didn't seem that bad.
And like, I'm actually kind of amazed at the amount of progress both of us may have made like in our lives since we started this podcast. If you think about how, you know, it's just over three years old now, The Back Page. We started it in November 2020, and at that time, you were, you know, fresh off of like, you know, leaving RPS and read pop, and I was on TechRadar.
And if you think about how much has changed since then, it's actually quite substantial, isn't it? And like, I just, yeah, I had no real notion of what the next few years would sort of hold. So yeah, I don't know, I feel oddly, oddly optimistic going to next year.
I can't quite explain why I just sort of like, I think maybe a bit of its age as well. You just start to take things less personally, you start to reckon with things and maybe a slightly healthier way. I don't really know what it is, but I'm just...
I had some, I had some, I've got some vengeance in me now because of social media has been rotten, particularly rotten the last couple of months. I saw, oh yeah, yeah.
I know what you're alluding to and that was... I'm taking a spirit of vengeance into 2024 and praying for the sake of certain motherfuckers that we don't encounter them in the flesh because oh boy, oh boy, people have been rude on that place.
Yeah, that was the other weird thing that happened this year actually was social media was particularly shit this year. Like it's obviously like X is a bad platform because of its owner for obvious reasons, but also there's the newer platforms which are sort of awful in their own way like Blue Sky is sort of like all the people I've muted from games Twitter are sort of on there doing their thing and after we mute them there's a bit of that going on and it's sort of like that's where you see a lot of people have the same opinions as me repeating them back at me and I just and I realized how much I hate myself and my own opinions reading them and I'm like I just don't want to engage with any of that. Threads is like someone combined Facebook and Twitter and that has the worst parts of both that's not good and yeah Twitter is just like I thought yeah some of the stuff I know you're alluding to the most bad faith like rotten takes and truthfully if that happened to me this year I would have more vengeance in my heart I'm sure something like that will happen to me next year and I'll be similarly enraged but I don't know if you've noticed this on Twitter people basically posting pornography as adverts yeah I've seen yeah I've seen that quite a lot that bitcoins stuff how is this allowed how it like what is going on on this this fucking I just gotta get off that thing yeah I've had a bit of that this year I'm like maybe too much mental energy is going into this I'm I'm punting out jokes and it's like do you want to have this like newly minted fucking gorilla picture or whatever and you're like this is why how did it get this bad I mean it's actually like it's like it's like you know when you walk around in Night City and Cyberpunk yeah and you're like oh this is so crass this is such a broad lazy satire like this is just there's just no truth in this at all and then you go on Twitter and you're like some of the stuff which has It's been allowed to be presented as an advert to me.
I'm like, oh no, no, that's right. You've built Night City here in your little corner of the internet and paid however many billions for the privilege. I mean, what a fucking bin.
It's got to be a scam. Like bots buying adverts, that's just money laundering, right?
Yeah.
I mean, what else is that? That's just money going into your own pocket. It's, oh, what a scam.
It's the same on Facebook. My friend Dave Scarborough sent me something he was served.
It was something about scenes in superhero films, and there's like four images in there. One of the pictures was of what looked like an AI-generated picture of Batman having sex with Wonder Woman. I was in a street, and I was like, who the fuck, and tens of thousands of people interacting with it.
Just on the street.
I was like, what the fuck is it? Is it just like adverts aimed at bots, paid for by bots? What the fuck is going on?
But you are right, it just seems to get terminally, but it's just turning into a hellscape. If Reddit goes away, the Internet is basically doomed because I started to use the Reddit as if it is the Internet. I don't know if you do that, but now I search for things on Reddit, like I'm using Google because I just want some people to tell me what the thing is like.
So yeah, it's tough out there, man. But yeah, social media. So I don't want to make it sound like I think things are rosy.
I definitely don't. But yeah, I guess I'm just trying to be serene after having a month off. But yeah, rough out there for sure.
Okay. So before we get to our top 10 list, Matthew, is there anything you wish you'd got to, that you didn't have time for in the games front? Anything you want to talk about here that won't be in your list?
Or just in general, you wish you had a bit more time for X, Y and Z?
No, not really. Like, you know, aside from there were some indie big hitters that enough people I respect liked that I didn't try. You know, I met up with my old staff writer, Tom Stone, who was singing the praises of Thirsty Suitors, and I didn't get round to playing that, even though it sounded, you know, super funny and interesting from what he was saying.
Yeah, I tried... There was a sort of breakout indie hit, Void Stranger. Did you hear about this at all?
Yeah, it's come up a few times, but I don't know much about it.
Yeah, so the whole thing with it is it's... There's a lot of hidden cleverness in it. And it's like one of those, a bit like, I guess like inscription, where, you know, what it is, it isn't really that.
And there's a lot more to it. And you're, you know... But like, I think there's so many layers to what it is that the more you play it, you end up playing it for like a hundred hours and have like this mind blowing experience.
But it's also one of these games that no one ever explicitly says what the thing is, because to know is the spoiler. But what it is on the surface is one of those soccer ban kind of tile based puzzlers, which I find very dry and very hard work. So I can't actually punch through to the exciting layer of that game.
I have tried and we're playing on the Steam Deck. And it's like, if I had an, if I had another month of not doing anything, I'm sure I would chip away at this thing and get to this apparently life-changing bit of weirdness within that everyone seems to rate so highly. But I just, I just can't, I do not like, I mean, it's not crate pushing.
It's like you kind of, you kind of magic away tiles and then magic them into a different space and it's kind of monochrome, kind of Game Boy looking, kind of top-down labyrinth. But I find that, I just find that puzzle so dry that it, that feels like it should come with a warning of like, if you're not into this, it's just going to be quite hard work to get the payoff.
Yeah, that's interesting. I love that's the one that you kind of like pick out there, but yeah, I'm sure there are.
I started playing it on, when I, when I went for my little holiday to the forest, the hot tub, I thought, oh, I'll play that there. And I played like, I don't know, six, seven hours of it. And I was like, well, I haven't really seen anything too out there yet, just a lot of boring floors of this tower with these boring puzzles.
Yeah. So yeah, I had to bin it off, but I, you know, I'm sure it's great.
Yeah, you wish it well.
I do wish it well.
Yeah, I think First You Suit is a good one. Like it's, you know, it's perspective I'm interested in and it does look like, the presentation looks exceptional. And yeah, like I say, like I mentioned earlier, it's sort of like releasing in November is very challenging for a game like that in this particular year.
So that's tricky. Another Annapurna game from this year, Storyteller. I kind of want to give that a go, like a kind of puzzle game about story.
It looked a bit quite simple, but quite nice.
Yeah, I played a bit of that, it was fun.
Yeah, yeah, that looked cool. And there was Turbo Overkill, one of the boomer shooters that came out this year from Apogee, quite fancy giving that a go. I've not played a little game called Baldur's Gate 3, so that's not on my list.
That was the one, the big sacrifice. I just wasn't gonna try and force four hours in of it just to talk about it on this podcast. It didn't seem worth it, because I suspected you would talk about it.
And there are other RPGs I did pursue this year instead. I will definitely come back to it at some point. Alan Wake 2, which I talked about in the, what we've been playing, I've not played since then, so I did about three or four hours, and I've got many more still to play of that one, so that's kind of missed out on my list.
There's a few other games that I'm gonna save from mentions where I didn't quite get enough time to put my arms around them completely, but I don't want to blow them all here. But I suppose those are the major ones, Matthew. So I didn't play Street Fighter VI, even though a good friend, Ian, sent us a code.
Maybe you'll blacklist us now, Matthew, because we just didn't play.
I did install it and play a little bit of it, and I'm so bad at it. I had nothing interesting to say about that game. That wouldn't just really annoy anyone who liked Street Fighter VI.
Not in that I think it's bad in any way. People I respect tell me it is next level genius, so kudos to it. But I'm still yet to find a fighting game which teaches itself to me in isolation.
Maybe that is just too big an ask.
Yeah. There was that, and then there was Diablo IV this year as well. I didn't have time for that one.
I don't know if that would be my thing, but I certainly bought it at some point, so I should probably give that a go. Yeah, I think those were the main ones though. Like everything else I tried to at least touch upon, I was quite surprised actually to see Lies of P on so many Game of the Year lists.
I thought that was considered a bit of a lesser, sort of like Souls-like, but evidently not. People seem to really dig the theme of that and how it looks and all that stuff.
I guess it was the sort of Souls-like for this year.
Yeah, that's true. Obviously, along those lines, Armored Core 6, I did not play this year. I know you did, Matthew, but I suspect it's not going to be on your list or in your honorable mentions.
I wish it well.
Do you know why I wish it well? I don't even know if I wish it well.
Okay, good. Yes. So those are the, I guess, that pretty much covers the stuff we haven't got to, but there'll be some more stuff in the honorable mentions, I'm sure.
So Matthew, very last thing before we get to our list then. So can you remember as a test what you called the best games of 2020, 2021, and 2022 on this podcast? Because I struggled a little bit with this, but I was curious if you had the memory power for it.
So 2020, I think, was Desperados 3.
Yeah, that's correct. Very good.
2021, that's probably got to be Hitman 3. That was at the year The Outer Worlds DLC came out. I remember rating that quite highly.
No, so you've got... This is interesting.
Is it really contrarian and bullshit? It's not Talos principle.
No, it's Metroid Dread, which is the best game of that year. Which I really like that year. Outer Worlds DLC, you had it at number 2, and Psychonauts at number 3.
So yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's good.
And last year, I think was Xenoblade.
I think that is correct. Let me just double check that, so Xenoblade has been mentioned 28 times in this document.
What a cursed home.
Should have written all these down, that's my fault.
What's that big book that they used to try and record, like the state of the nation in in medieval times?
The Book of Grudges kind of thing.
Yeah, they had this book, which everyone who was alive was recorded in this big book, because there were so few people, you could feasibly do it in a big book.
Yeah, yeah. You had Xenoblade Chronicles 3 at number one last year, and then you had Signalis at number two. Remember that game?
Signalis? I love Signalis. I don't think I've said the word Signalis since that podcast.
Yeah, well, that's it. Well, that's because of a fucking unending avalanche of blockbusters came out, so you had no reason to ever discuss it again. Yeah, well done.
Yeah, it was good.
Well, that was pretty successful.
That's pretty good.
I would test yours, but I didn't have them to hand.
No, that's fine. I remember, so I can test myself a little bit here. I remember last year's, it was Tunic, I remember, because I thought about that quite a lot.
I settled on that. It was that or Cult of the Lamb. It was kind of like between those, really, and I had Seafoot number three.
I remember the first year we did this podcast. I picked Apex Legends because I couldn't not pick it because it was my pandemic game. So, that was that, and I think but Destiny number two for that year, which is actually quite a depressing list when you think about it.
So, that's on me, really. But you know, that was, oh, no, it was Destiny 2. I had it for 2020.
So that was my fault to not remember that. So yeah, and therefore 2021, I have no idea what I picked for that year. I have no memory of it whatsoever.
So again, thank you to GreyMS for capturing all of this. My number one was Hitman 3. So I picked that.
And I had Age of Empires 4 at number 2 and Deathloop at number 3. That's a pretty solid top 3.
That's quite a weird top 3.
It was a bit of an odd year. I was like still struggling to get through enough games, I think. But each year we've done this, I think I've gotten slightly better at it.
So yeah, hopefully this top 10 will be the best top 10 that I've done.
I feel like you always bring a strong effort to the end of your list, Matthew. So shall we take a quick break and come back with our top 10s?
Welcome back to the podcast. So, me and Matthew are struggling to remember how to actually do this, as you might have noticed a bit in that first section, as we've wandered between subjects there, but we'll get there eventually. So, our top 10s in this section.
Matthew, before we get to the top 10s, was there a game you found particularly disappointing from this year? Something you played and you were like, oh, I asked this every year. I think I had Alien Fireteam Elite one year.
I remember thinking, oh, I'm really up for a game where you just shoot loads and loads of aliens, and then it just did nothing for me whatsoever. But yeah, this year, what have you got?
Persona 5 Tactica was a bit of a nothing for me. I found it to be a hugely un-stylish add-on to one of the most stylish things going. Maybe the Persona 5 party is just over now, and that's fine if it is.
The big one for me, though, was Rain Code, the game from Mr. Danganronpa, which I was anticipating true greatness, something of Danganronpa quality. And I think their attempts to set a detective game in this kind of open world on the Switch was just really, really misjudged. It had some absolutely horrible, horrible characters in it, some horrible writing in it.
It takes quite a lot to kind of, I don't want to say shock me is probably the wrong word, but I'll tolerate a lot of bullshit, a lot of anime bullshit in games. And that one was just too much for me. So there we go.
That's my slightly prudish take.
Well, luckily Paranormal Sight came along instead, Matthew, and wowed you. And I'm sure you're looking forward to Level 5's Dekker Police next year.
Oh, yeah, I mean, God, the Level 5 Renaissance, the second coming, that's exciting to me. Like they're making all their games again. I mean, that's wild.
Yeah, I think we're both going to have that as like a prediction for next year in our next week's episode. So yes. So this is a weird one because I don't think this is a bad game, right?
But this is a game I thought was going to like knock my socks off. And then it was actually a little bit, which was Bolt Gun, the Warhammer 40,000 shooter, which I bought on Steam a few months ago. And the funny thing is, right, there are a lot of these sort of boomer shooters around.
I know now I know what the etymology of that term is. I hate calling them that. But the, you know, I think that in some ways, maybe the thing that happened with Doom clones originally has sort of happened with this genre where there is so much of it that not all of it is gold and there are maybe too many to choose from and like not all of them are up to the same standard.
So I thought, well, surely if they're basing one on the wall, have a 40,000 license, they'll raise the bar a bit higher. I honestly thought, apart from the fact they got that sort of like chain sword slicing through enemies interaction right, which does feel really good in this game, I otherwise didn't think there was anything about it that really stood out as a kind of shooter. And I played about, I think, like six or seven levels and I just found myself done with it, unfortunately.
So that was the one where I thought, oh, this will be an easy game of the year entry for me because, you know, I like the idea of like this sort of 80s or 90s, 40k aesthetic and this type of game. But unfortunately didn't really do anything for me. So yeah, that was kind of my one from this year where I thought, ah, I thought this would just be better than it was.
So alas, it happens. Matthew, let's get to the top 10s then. So do you want to kick off with your number 10?
I'm going to kick off with my number 10. My number 10 is called Let's Revolution.
I've never heard of it. How is that possible? You didn't read about it in my freaking blog post.
Oh yeah, sorry. I wish I read thoroughly, of course.
A very late addition to this list, but one that's been on my radar for a while after Catherine played it and said, oh, you should really play this. This is up your street. It is very much up my street.
It is a rogue-like, sort of tactics-ish game with a dose of Minesweeper, which is why I dig it, being a big Minesweeper head. You're trying to find a king hidden on this grid with numbered tiles, revealing how many tiles touching that tile have a piece of road on it, and the road will eventually lead to the king. But also, on that road is where enemy agents can appear, the spies who work for the king.
The game is sort of Minesweeper in that you're using these numbers to logically deduce, well, these tiles are roads, so I should try and avoid walking on those because there might be an enemy. But you are also trying to make progress around the board to reach this king, which then moves you on to the next board and you do a succession of, I think, nine or so of these. And that's like the roguelike run.
If you die, you're back to the start, you lose all your power ups. Really unusual. Is it for everyone?
Probably not. If you are, you know, if you don't mind roguelike games, which I don't, and you like roguelike games which are quite short, like the runs are maybe half an hour or so, that works for me. The Minesweeper of it all, obviously very, very cool.
Yeah, I just thought this, it reminded me a little bit of like Capybara games, like Grindstone or Heroes of Might and Magic, in that they took something quite familiar, you know, here Minesweeper, and just did something mechanically very unusual with it, which really, really resonated with me. I like it when people find very fresh spins on quite kind of classic mechanics. It's also got really good selection of unlockable characters whose mechanics are so different that it really does feel like you're relearning or playing a different game with each run when you start unlocking characters, like the way tiles behave and the way that they fight back against enemies is substantially different.
So you're not just bringing the same kind of tactics through, which is sometimes the floor of these games, so yeah, kind of came out of nowhere, but speaking to our discoverability issue, thank you to Catherine and Rock Paper Shotgun for still fighting a good fight and covering as many of these indie games as they can because this one was a gem.
Well, so first of all, apologies for not reading your blog. I think I had to fire it out before I got on an airplane. Is that what happened?
Yeah, that was the one time I didn't read it and change the dashes to make sure they were all in the same sort of dash format. So this looks like someone put a Minesweeper on Extreme Makeover or something. It's visually spectacular.
It really is. Looks amazing. So yeah, I'm sorry to have let this pass me by, but I am pleased that you've ambushed me with this Mobius looking puzzle game straight out of the gate.
That's a good kickoff point, you know?
Yeah, kind of fun hand-drawn animation style, about a hundred reviews on Steam or something. This one didn't get reviewed anywhere and it didn't become a breakout hit on Steam, so it's a double whammy.
Yeah, it's currently 30% off in the Steam sale and so yeah, that will still apply when this episode goes live, I assume. So yeah, at least for a couple of days anyway. So cool.
Well, actually, I've added that to my Steam wishlist, Matthew, and I'll probably just buy it out of guilt to maintain this partnership on this podcast. So yeah.
That's kind of you. Remember that goodwill when some of my more contrarian takes later arise.
Do you know what? The funny thing is, when you said Let's Revolution, I thought that had a bit of the energy of like, Eugene Acker's WiiWare games and I thought it was going to be an homage to them. Yeah, I thought it had that.
I thought it was going to be, oh yeah, they've made a rogue-like of Let's Catch or something.
Let's Revolution is going to be a hula hoop game. It's about gyrating your hips for a dungeon, as Eugene Acker.
Yeah, Well, Let's Revolution does have a bit of like Nintendo sort of like digital download game energy as a title. So yeah, it's even got an exclamation mark in the title, which he didn't hold against it. And I respect that.
No, no, I would normally.
Okay, my highly conventional number 10 by comparison, Matthew, is Dredge. You're familiar with this game, of course. Is this higher on your list?
I'm guessing not.
It isn't.
Yeah, okay. So, fishing horror based game that was published by Team17, made by, I think, Black Salt Games to death. Why did I not just fucking write that down?
Or why do I just try and sell out? Yeah, I think that is right. I think they're based in New Zealand.
So this game is one of the big breakout indies of the year. And I think that's very fair because the idea of it clearly just captured people's imaginations, which is just a fishing horror game. You're on like a ramshackle boat going around an archipelago, archipelago, I fucking struggle with this word.
A set of islands, let's say, let's just say that instead of just say it said. I really have to readjust the podcasting at this point. And I think that there's actually nothing that's particularly stand out about it, apart from the way it looks.
It's a very nice looking game. Like it's sort of I wouldn't say like it's got like a cartoony inflection to the art style, I guess. But it is like recognizably a horror game.
Like there's a lot of like muted colors and there's not you know, you're not you're looking at something anti-cozy, I would say, when you're looking at it. Like it's a you know, it's it's a game where you are, you know, basically taking a boat around around a series of shores. You're looking for you are fishing, you're investigating wrecks, that kind of thing.
And also going to like different towns and in sort of like unpicking mysteries and that sort of thing. But you can just tell from the look of it that it is it is trying to convey something a little bit darker. And indeed, while there is sea life out there, there are also Lovecraftian kind of like monsters and larger sea life, which are obviously spooky in themselves.
I remember like a blue whale passing under my boat in this being just like such an unsettling moment, even though I'm sure that's what it would be like to encounter one of those things in real life. They are just obviously spectacularly large. I think that it thrives because all of those individual elements are done quite well and they add up to something just very, very compelling.
It does create, I would say like the central narrative, which is basically a sort of like a mystery that leads you on a bit of a MacGuffin hunt, isn't necessarily the most interesting thing about it. It really is just going out there and seeing is this world as weird as they're kind of hinting at the start of their game and what's going on in this day-night cycle when at night, certain things seem to start appearing in the middle of the water that are causing you to crash your ship and the sense that something is just unsettling, is bubbling away beneath the surface. It's very, very effective and I think that those first few hours as you kind of like explore and work out what's going on are just fantastic.
I can see why it captured people's imaginations and like I said, even though I don't think the fishing is necessarily amazing, I don't think like upgrading your boat like has tons of mileage in it. And in some ways, I think it does become slightly less compelling as it goes. This is, I guess, just a little bit of balance.
But I just think it what a fucking great idea for a game and so well executed and like just a deserved standout, because I just like the idea of something like this clicking in people's brains, like a light bulb going off, fishing horror game, and then it being as good as it needed to be to like live up to that that premise. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I've seen loads of people seeing the praise of this. I've played like a couple of hours of it myself, and I completely get what you mean about like the strength those first hours, like the loop is very compelling. It's interesting you described the kind of look of it as anti-cozy, because actually, if not for the, you know, unknowable kind of horror, cosmic horror elements of it, the kind of routine of running your business and like improving your boat and catching the fish and putting them in the inventory, it almost is quite cosy, you know, there almost is like a harvest moon or a kind of, you know, the simple pleasure of just a simple job well done, you know.
And so to sort of marry that very kind of hypnotic loop with growing sense of unease and whatever is going on with the bigger narrative, yeah, yeah, super interesting as a hybrid and, yeah, it's clearly caught the imagination of, you know, fucking it feels like loads of people talked about this game this year.
It does and there are just moments where you find yourself just sort of like stranded in like a in like the middle of some like a large body of water and you can only see a tiny pinprick of light in the distance of where the nearest town is and you realize you're much further away than you need to be and some, you know, some bad things could happen to you and some noises are getting louder and some like images are getting closer and it just just yeah it just really is effective as a horror game and yeah the less you know the more effective it is I guess but like when you do like make a journey into a to a part of the map you've not been to before you do feel like you're basically like you know like out of Columbus or something like an astronaut you're just like oh wow I just I remember when I was just in my own little kind of like bay fishing around I'm now properly exploring this map, and my boat can move faster, and I feel a little bit more confident being out there, and I have a better sense of the world and what I'm doing. And I think it just really is a great little journey to take you on in this game. I've not played the DLC they've released, but I will go back to it and play that at some point.
But yeah, definitely I could deserve the entry here. A really great summer game to dig into on the old Steam Deck. I didn't trust this to run on Switch.
I'm sure it runs fine on Switch, but I play my indie games on Steam Deck these days, so yeah. What's your number nine, Matthew?
My number nine is Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Future Redeemed.
So it's a major DLC pack, right?
Yeah, the final piece of DLC for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 that, unlike Xenoblade Chronicles 2 DLC, Torn of the Golden Country, which they sold as a standalone, this one I think you do have to own Xenoblade 3 to get. Even though it is substantial enough, I'd say, to be a standalone game. A lot of its strengths are the same as the Golden Countries, in that it takes the whole Xenoblade experience and crushes it down into a 25-hour campaign.
So you start with new characters, you level them up all the way to the higher levels, but in 25 hours instead of 150 hours. So you get that accelerated power curve, you get all the big emotional story beats, you get some brilliant new music, which is always a key part of why I love these games. It has a whole new landmass of its own and what makes this one stand out and why it really resonated is that it is a prequel to Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but it also ties up a lot of story strands from Xenoblade 1 and 2.
You know, for people who aren't going to, you know, who still plan to play these games, I've carefully stepped around spoiling them in the past and I'll continue to do so now. But they are kind of... The Xenoblade games, they're all sort of standalone adventures, but they kind of hint at a deeper connection.
Xenoblade 3 made that a little bit more explicit. This makes it super explicit and brings back some characters from the previous games into the mix. So huge burst of fan service.
Some of the locations you go to are direct rifts on things from previous Xenoblade games. So that was just a big nostalgic rush for me. Kind of like, you know, maybe this has been done in other sequels, JRPG sequels that I haven't played or other spin-off games that I haven't played.
But the idea of a little game that kind of, kind of investigates what happens to these heroes after their life's quest is done. You know, you've saved the world. You've done the thing your game was about.
And then what happens to them afterwards when they're a little bit older and what do they get up to? You know, like the idea of checking back in with these characters, you know, 10 years, 15 years down the line. I thought that was really cute.
And as a wider project, I just love that Nintendo have really invested in Xenoblade. You know, it's created and led by Tetsuya Takahashi, who very famously is behind a lot of unfinished works. You know, he worked on XenoSaga and I think made like half the games he set out to make.
And so to see someone who has grand ambitions and storytelling ambitions that, you know, cover multiple games and spin-off games and DLC episodes and be able to sort of see that project through to its completion on Nintendo's dime, like amazing. I mean, what a, what I like a happy ending, one would assume, for that creator's sort of story that they finally found a home where they're like safeguarded and can actually do the work they want to do, you know, I find that very pleasing.
Yeah, so, you know, it's just like the Citadel DLC for Mass Effect 3 of Xenoblade, Matthew, where it's like the...
Yeah, yeah.
But with no house party, no house party in it, you know.
Yeah, it tickles the same kind of fan service in places, but it is like its own... Like the central characters are new characters to the whole, you know, they're new to the whole series. So, it is fundamentally about these new people and where they fit in, but yeah.
And also, like, they're not having to do it to kind of like cheer people up or apologize to them because everyone hated the last part of their trilogy. This is just a... Like this whole Xenoblade thing is just a big success story for this guy, you know.
They made loads of games. Everyone really liked them. They've worked out how to make massive JRPGs but to a time frame that like no one else can probably helps because of the like technological ambitions of them.
You know, like, if you look at Final Fantasy XVI, like in the time it takes to make one of those, you know, they made two of these things and two spin-offs. And it just speaks to what you can do when you're unshackled from like the graphics arms race, I think.
Yeah, I think as well, it's like it's nice to tie the bow on this particular generation where they've got, you can play this entire series minus, I guess, Chronicles X, but it doesn't really count anyway. You can play those three games and all their DLC on the Switch. And that basically represents the best of what Japanese RPGs are right now.
And that's a kind of like a chunk of stuff you can just go off and enjoy. It's quite an amazing body of work. Like you say, they just, they can make it in less time than other developers can.
And, you know, like if, again, like what we've learned about budgets this year, maybe there's something to be said for keeping your Nintendo kind of like keeping the technological level where they have. Like maybe that makes it easier and cheaper to make games. And maybe that's a good thing.
Like that's, you know, there's something perhaps to be said for that. So, yeah, that's cool to hear this in the list, Matthew.
I mean, this is not for people who have not played. You've got to have played everything or this thing is baffling as shit. So do not touch it if you have not played and are very familiar with one and two and three.
Cool. I'll make sure, yeah, to when I tweet out the like which games we picked, I'll make sure it's written in like red text and bold. Do not play this unless you've played 350 hours of other JRPGs first.
So good. My number nine then Matthew is Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Is this on your list?
It isn't.
Oh, wow. You're always like, you're always a bit out on the Sony first party games. That was madness when you didn't put Last of Us 2 or Ghost of Shima in your 2020 list.
But hey, I'll let you do you.
So they're like 10 games that were vying for the bottom three slots.
Right.
There are some other shockers in there.
Okay. Interesting. So, all right.
So this is an interesting one because I didn't like so Starfield's gonna be one of my own mentions, right? I didn't quite have time to finish it as I unlocked some of the powers and I didn't get to the end. I want to see what the new game plus was because I didn't get that far.
I didn't have it in the list. But for a long time, Starfield was in the Spider-Man 2 slot of this list. And then I just thought, oh, because Spider-Man 2 is the one I finished.
I'll put that in here instead because I still need to just like get about 40 more hours of Starfield. But yeah, so Spider-Man 2 gets in here. So sequel obviously to the very, very successful 2018 PS4 exclusive Spider-Man game.
And Miles Morales lets you play as both Spider-Men and introduces symbiote powers that Venom is the kind of like main villain of this along with Kraven the Hunter. And it builds on the Spider-Man story that was established in those previous games, which is kind of like a slightly older Peter Parker sort of like teacher age in this game. And what his life is like as Spider-Man as an adult, which is actually, you know, I would say a more interesting angle than the Tom Holland films, which are very much Nat Trad, teen Spider-Man, Stanley, Steve Ditkovain, but I feel like has been pretty much mind to death and who gives a shit, let's do something a bit different.
So yeah, I love I love having that kind of mix and Miles is the age that Peter was when he became Spider-Man. So they complement each other really nicely. The two characters get loads and loads of great character development in this.
I think the writing is really very, very strong. They weave Peter's friend, Harry Osborn, back into the story, who has been suffering from what is strongly suggested to be a terminal illness and has been given something basically to help him deal with that and to restore him to health, but maybe not all as it seems. So this game...
It ain't paracetamol.
That's true. So this game unpicks their friendship, it explores, kind of Craven the Hunter is this, I would say quite high stakes Spider-Man villain, surprisingly well done in that respect. And then Venom is kind of a late addition to the story dropped in here.
And I think what it basically adds up to is a super refined sequel that doesn't waste too much of your time, has very strong side content, I would say adds to the Spider-Man moveset in some really strong ways and then adds to it in, I think, some more mixed ways as well. I think the addition of gliding in this game is really cool as a way to get around the world. So much of the appeal of these Spider-Man games is tied up in how they've taken that old Spider-Man to momentum-based swinging around the city, but really dialed it up and modernized it and given you everything you want from that ability.
And they've done such a good job of building on it here. Like I say, side content is genuinely strong, some sort of narrative tie-ins to your usual fetch quest type stuff. Pretty good.
You can knock the entire game off in about 30 hours, which is cool. Nice to have a reasonably sized blockbuster game this year. Has a few MJ missions in there, which aren't amazing, but also don't waste your time too much.
They're slightly better than they were in the first game. I think pretty much it is better than the first game in every single way, so I definitely have to hand it that. Yet, I still didn't love it quite as much as the first game, and I can't quite work out why that is.
I think maybe in some ways I thought they slightly overcomplicated the combat system. The addition of a parry was the thing that drove me nuts. Just trying to remember to do a button that's not the dodge button to deal with certain enemy attacks, and the dodge button no longer dodging.
That was a sum in my head. I was like, I'm not sure that's good design, sadly. I think you might have just played a few too many Souls games there, and you're like, we'll stick a little extra thing in here.
I think it's easier when you've done three games and you're going a little bit overdesign your game a little bit. So I thought there's a little bit of that feature creep coming in there. But that is like, there was also maybe some like boss encounters were a little bit too lengthy.
But I think I'm looking at a gift for us in the mouth here. Like if you like Spider-Man, this is such a great complete vision of what his world is and conveying that in this in this video game form that takes it seriously and still manages to give you a fresh angle on something that's been retold so many times across so much different media. Yeah, well done in some way.
A really kind of like a really solid job. But I very much did enjoy it. And I think it definitely deserves a place in this list.
Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, this was so nearly in the list. Like I had it on my list at different points in the process. I swapped it out for something else, which I kind of think is sort of similar to it in terms of what I like about it and what it's doing with franchises and stuff.
But yes, I thought this was great, particularly at a time where the Marvel film and TV project is just imploding under the waves of bullshit and bad writing. I thought this was both a great way of making a Spider-Man story, which still kind of weaves into the wider Marvel universe, but without overpowering it. And also how to do quite a long-form story, which, given Marvel have shown themselves so poor at this in the television space, they don't know how to fill ten hours of television with a story, I actually thought the pacing and the moves and shifts in this were really elegantly done.
It helps that they have the two Spider-Man. But I think what they did with the villains was great as well. I really love this game.
I think this is just testament to what a strong year it is that something as good as this didn't make my top ten.
Yeah, it's funny actually because I watched No Way Home again recently. While I think that… I mean that film is COVID as hell by the way in how it's filmed, all those glass boxes with Spider-Man villains and them, very strange.
And they're all in his flat.
For about 40 minutes, that goes on for ages. So I thought the writing was quite poor in that actually compared to this. The writing is…
I think Insomniac's writing is much stronger than you'll find in those Tom Holland films. I don't think the writing really stands out at all. The magic trick of that film obviously is just bringing all the old Spider-Men back and that still works in a second viewing for sure.
There is definitely some good moving dialogue in there, but I think I agree this has to sustain that story for a much longer period of time. D'Arceo very successfully doesn't blot out Miles Morales from the story despite the fact that it's not really his story that's been told, it is more of a Peter story, but still make him a really crucial point of that. The most affecting emotional part of this game I think was when Peter wouldn't return Miles' calls properly.
It wasn't being very nice to him. I thought I was the saddest stuff in the game because I think that felt more real to me than all of the slightly more heightened emotional stuff going on with Harry.
The stuff for me is when the quarrels between domestic partners turn one of them into a literal monster. They're like, you'll never do the dishes and then they become fucking villain and they're like, oh man.
I hate when that happens.
They're for the grace of God go I.
The other thing is as well, the two Spider-Men thing. When you meet another one of them when they're solving a crime or solving a crime, beating some dudes up and then you high five at the end of it. Those touches were just great really.
That's the most you can really make out of the two Spider-Man concept along with some really cool team up moves in that Arkham Knight fashion that we really liked in that game and have talked about a bunch of times. That's the best way you can make the most out of having two Spider-Men without it being a multiplayer game basically. I don't think anyone played this and was hankering for an online multiplayer component to it.
I think people were really happy with how they balanced the two and how they let you switch between them. Of course, we have to give a shout out to the opening with Sandman, which is probably the most next-gen thing I've seen on any console so far this generation. Yeah.
Well done, everyone.
Maybe the Titan boss fight?
Oh, shit. Yeah, that's a good point.
Although that's quite scripted and canned. You don't have free movement around that thing.
Yeah. Either way, you just get the sense that that PS5 SSD is getting a great fucking workout. You know what I mean?
It's good. You're like, well done. You proved why we needed this thing.
So that's good. Okay. Well, do you know what?
Nothing is more fascinating to me now than hearing what the remaining game in your bottom three, Matthew.
My number eight is Star Wars Jedi Survivor.
Higher on my list.
Interesting.
Yep. So you come to my number eight, which I don't think will be on your list. Pikmin 4.
Higher on my list. Whoa!
Okay, well, that's a shocker. So what's your number seven, Matthew? Pikmin 4.
Oh, perfect. Okay.
They're jostling. It's like a great Mario Kart race.
They're jostling like a pack of oat cheese. Why don't you talk about Pikmin 4, Matthew, and why it's good.
Yeah. Yeah. What I love about Pikmin 4 is it takes everything that's good about Pikmin, that very specifically Nintendo take on a strategy game, which is still stressful and kind of panic inducing as you manage this army of very frail seeds, seed creatures, and there's this constant sort of worry and time pressure of like, at the end of the day, these things are going to be lost.
So you're constantly aware of, of not going too far out of your comfort zone. But it also, it never becomes too complicated. It's really just boiled down to like managing this one group of things, the different sort of Pikmin types, you know, people know what Pikmin is, but at its heart, I think, you know, I love the just the elegance of how they've captured the kind of emotions of strategy games, but in a way which my non-strategic brain can kind of enjoy them.
This one, it grows out into just a really massive adventure, easily the biggest Pikmin game. And with that comes some flaws, like it's quite baggy, it's quite bloated, it takes a while to get going. A lot of its pressures don't emerge until like the end game, which I've only just reached and I'm not explored massively myself.
But even so, like the body of the quest, while I thought generally lower pressure than the previous Pitman's, because the main campaign isn't governed by like an overarching time pressure, that's the kind of key missing ingredient from this. I still, I just love that world, you know, I love the, you know, everyday items are giant. It looks really handsome.
It's incredibly cute while also being really sinister. It's one of the few cute games that actually clicks with me because it's not trying to be cloyingly cute. It's not trying to like, I mean, they are trying to sell merchandise, but it feels like it's accidentally adorable because there's so much horror in this world as well when these things get munched.
I just found it a really complete, satisfying experience, just really, really polished and just a great example of what Nintendo are doing of just letting their teams take their time and building like the biggest, most fleshed out versions of their franchises ever, which has kind of been the Switch story. It's like, you know that thing you love, well, here it is, but there's more than ever before and it's all pretty great and I'm like, great, I'm enjoying this trajectory.
Yeah, it's truly, honestly, like an amazing Nintendo time, constantly excited by, you know, basically every quarter, there's something great to play on your Switch. This is, yes, one of the Nintendo games in my list. And I agree that it's, you know, like it's basically a version of real time strategy.
That's what Pikmin's always been. But this one's interesting, because I do agree, it's very, very prolonged. It's like it asks for a lot of your time for the return, I would say.
The learning curve is quite gentle, and it takes maybe slightly too long to become properly challenging as you allude to there. Like the end game is where it heats up a little bit. And then there is one other thing at the end that it resembles a more traditional shape of a Pikmin game that is sort of like your hardcore sort of offering, I guess.
And so it admits that just to like, we still want to get the pacing issues out of the way before I praise it. There's also all of the dialogue bits with the NPC characters as spacemen and all that are kind of just waffle and don't really need to be in the game, don't add anything really. But you get past that and it is such a generous game, like these amazing environments that you explore.
It's kind of like has an adventure game feel because you are going into this like basically foreign world where these monsters marching around that are going to eat your little Pikmin. There are these like hatches you go into these dungeons to find what's down there and I'm going to uncover all these artifacts of the old world including like you know Game Boy Advances and lots of fun Nintendo bits and pieces and I think one of my more popular tweets of the year.
Which one was that? Thank you Nintendo.
Which one was that?
It was a load of Pikmin carrying a Game Boy Advance and it was just like the lads are off down to CES.
That's pretty good. I like that.
I'll take it. It's though Geoff Keighley is in Borgon, but what can I say?
Fair enough. So yeah, I think that there is this flattened out learning curve. It's as flat as you can possibly make it, but it is undeniably a good hang, I think.
It's fun to just poke around this world and feel like you're basically taking over bits and pieces of it as you remove the threat of the monsters. When you do get to the later parts of the game post the first set of credits, it does have more to show you in some quite cool places. The combat is slightly guilty of, you pointed this out, that your frozen Pikmin are always going to be your most useful ones, because you just chuck them in there.
They're a little bit too powerful. You don't have as many reasons to use some of the other ones, so the Black Rock Pikmin are pretty good. They do some serious damage.
I think it does eventually find the challenge level that stimulates you, even if in the middle of it there is this period where you're like, oh, I may be tuning out of this a little bit. But I will say, despite all that, that core loop is so, so compelling. This was my summer game.
Incredibly compulsive. I played it for 40 hours in the end, which is absolutely massive. It's a huge game.
I really do think that there are just plenty of peaks along the way where it does get exciting, where the stakes do feel high, where you are being challenged. The Dandori challenges can be quite, Dandori battles can be quite fun. Just some really cool ways they play with the concept.
There are the nighttime bits where you basically have to go out and farm a specific type of crystal with a specific type of Pikmin, while loads and loads of monsters march towards your little nest thing, basically just like a nighttime horde mode, just a really cool little idea that again just dials up the challenge in little bursts and absolutely packed with character and just like, just really, a really complete feeling package. If this is your first touch point with Pikmin, then I think you'll just be absolutely in love with it. Whatever they do next, I'm completely on board because this has hooked me on Pikmin for the first time really, so complete.
So yeah, I'm glad it's on both of our lists, Matthew. I thought you might not have made it onto your list because I know it's one of the games you hadn't played for a while, but maybe you got to it at the end of the year.
Yeah, just really, really charming. I started playing it the weekend when we went up for Joe Scribble's wedding and there was a fair amount of sitting around in a hotel beforehand. And so I was in just a good mood because obviously, you know, you can see one of my good friends get married.
So there was lots of positive vibes. So those positive vibes mixed with like, you know, a positive tweet success and delightful little Pikmin.
We've got to get you off Twitter as the takeaway from this podcast.
It's really very, very bad.
Well, glad Pikmin 4 got the attention it deserves from The Back Page boys then. Yes. I felt like the way I will eventually die will be some Pikmin carrying me away to be farmed into something or another.
How many Pikmin do you think it will require to carry each of us?
Definitely 250. Absolutely. Yeah.
Okay. Good stuff. So, right.
Is it my number 7?
So, you're number 7.
So, my number 7 is My House, the Doom 2 mod, Matthew. Did you expect this to be on my list?
I was expecting this to appear.
So, My House is an old Doom 2 mod of someone's house. It was released by Steve Veg Nelson as a tribute to his friend, Tom, who died last August. Except none of that is true.
It's actually a horror game. It is a Doom level or a series of levels, depending on how you look at it, where a house full of Doom enemies, a normal house, like a normal suburban American house, you clear out the enemies, you leave the house, go around the outside, and then you see more enemies inside. You go inside and the house's layout has changed.
And that keeps fucking happening. And then it gets weirder and weirder. It keeps morphing into something stranger and darker that uses Doom's existing iconography in some really cool ways, but also has a bunch of its own kind of like weird new enemies.
It has multiple paths and endings. It will show you things you'd never expect to see in a Doom level. It is majestic.
And it does everything a great horror game is supposed to do. That's what this really is. My house is a horror game.
It will surprise you. It will shock you. It will reward your curiosity with terrifying shit.
And it features a heavily mean DreamWorks character as a boss battle. What more could you want? I think it really is.
I think it's just a great celebration of everything Doom does well. And also just like a crystallization of everything that that amazing like WAD slash mod scene can has accomplished with these old games. And there's like even stuff that I didn't realize is in the game, like a red apiece by some PC Gamer where there is a bit of the game where they the game you seem to fail and it kicks you out into regular Doom 2.
But then if you finish that level in Doom 2, it actually takes you back into my house and the horror begins again. And it just this is so much invention to it. And I spent probably like six to eight hours unpicking it, finding every secret, like I'd wandered to one ending where basically the sky was red and everyone who was in this house was clearly dead.
And then the game was kind of like giving you this terrifying thing about all these people who used to live there, what happened to them and all this stuff. And then I realized that was actually just like one optional smaller side to the actual main quest. So I went back and did that.
And it has a proper finale and it's really incredible. So for people that could be bothered to actually install a mod and go and do this, I really do think it's worth it just for the ways that it will surprise you. It will do all of these tricks that you might not realize that people can do with Doom II mods and just really like sort of like bend your brain in some cool ways.
So yeah, there it is, Matthew, the soods pick. Are you happy?
I'm happy that you found something which slightly fucked you up this year. I know that this is like your ongoing quest, which, you know, can only end horrifically for you. Whenever I think of you in your quest for endless horrors, I always end up thinking of the kind of deviant villains in Hellraiser films, because all they want is to kind of push their body to the most extreme pain and horror imaginable, and they end up playing with the Cenobites as a result.
So I think that is your final destination, because you're going to work your way through Doom mods, and then the next thing you know, it's the fucking Lament Configuration or whatever. But I wish you well, and I'll mourn for you.
That's beautiful, man. That's really articulate, spectacular. I think you're right.
I mean, the thing I sort of like, some people simply wrote in and asked, what's the kind of like ideal game you want to make? And I probably came up with some bullshit answer that was kind of like waffling on. But now I know what game I want to make, and that is I've got like the MetaQuest 3, right?
And it actually has a front mounted camera and can show your room in full color. And what I really want to do, it's like a horror mystery game where it places like items to solve a mystery around your room. And then PT style shit starts happening like to your actual living room.
And then like you look behind you and then just see like a figure in the distance. But it's like, it's so wet, because the camera is like slightly kind of blurry, you kind of get that slightly PT-ish filter effect. I want to do that way you are basically, it basically turns your room into like a really haunted fucked up place and not in a corny way, in a way that like ruins your life.
That's now my dream game, Matthew.
So do you remember when all those Quest 3 owners died because of that?
The closest someone has made so far is a game where you can basically get a baseball bat and zombies will climb out of portals in your living room. You just batter them, it looks quite silly. But I want to do like the fucked up kind of exorcist version of that.
I do not want my house to become so cursed to me that I can't rest easy. But you know, you are in command of your own space.
God, that's got such like a Larry David inflection when you say that. It's a big Kirby enthusiasm energy. Okay, so we come to your number six, don't we, Matthew?
Yeah, an equally spooky offering. Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo.
Not on my list, but I thought this would get pretty high for you.
Yeah, this is my obligatory Square Enix made a weird sort of visual novel thing just for me. Last year, it was a centennial case, which was, I couldn't believe my luck that they made that. This is a more straightforward visual novel about a group of individuals set across a couple of days, I think it is, and they are all involved in a series of curses.
In this lore, different people get different curses, which are activated by doing different things. If you kill people with your curses, if you kill enough people with your curse, you can bring a loved one back to life, and all these different people find themselves either maliciously pursuing this dream, or trying to deal with the fallout of all these curses. That is just great.
That's a really fun set up for a game. It's a really good excuse to have all these multiple storylines happening at once, so it's got a little bit of that Shibuya Scramble. You jump between timelines.
Different things you do in different timelines affect other strands of the story, so sometimes you have to make sure something plays out a certain way to aid someone in their storyline and so forth. But very compact compared to Shibuya Scramble. It's about 10 hours long.
Written and directed by a guy called Takanari Ishiyama, who I'd not heard of. I think this is his first game that got released in the West. Apparently he's worked on a lot of detective visual novel games, which are very popular, which I'd never heard of.
Apparently he worked on Metal Gear Solid the original as a sound designer, which is kind of interesting because I think there are some weird Kojima-isms in Paranormal Sight in terms of the way it kind of plays, it breaks the fourth wall in certain ways and plays with the kind of conventions of video game menus and things like that in ways that I won't spoil. A lot of that stuff is front-loaded, so you go in thinking, wow, this is going to be the most experimental game ever. Actually, it kind of fades off as the story goes on, it lets the story kind of step forward.
I think it was Chris Schilling who actually said there's quite a lot of sing in this game as well, which is probably why it resonates. And I definitely see that in that it has, you know, a handful of really well-realised puzzles, but I wouldn't say the whole thing is a puzzle game per se. And it has really good character work and a very striking art style.
It's just a really good time. Great music, great vibes, you know, is slightly spooky when it needs to be, but also goofy, very endearing characters. You want certain people to win, and you know, you have that kind of buy-in and investment in the story, and that's crucial.
Yeah, like a real pleasant surprise that, you know, a big publisher like Square Enix can still find it in their hearts to release very niche narrative projects and localise them for everyone. I hope, and I've said this before in the pod, but whatever process is happening that allows these games to be made, I hope it continues because, like, it is keeping me really well fed.
Dare I say it, this looks like it's done alright. It's got almost 2000 reviews on Steam, which is not bad.
It's in quite a few end of year lists as well. Like, I feel like it's broken out a bit. I mean, maybe for a Square Enix game, that's kind of small potatoes, but yeah, it's not, I wouldn't say it's niche.
I wouldn't say any Square Enix game is niche. Like, I've heard more people talk about this than the Centennial Case, for sure. Like, maybe like the anime style of it is, you know, that it doesn't have the FMV thing going on, so it's a bit more palatable to most people.
The horror element as well might be a little bit more, you know...
Yeah, I don't over-sell that. Like, this isn't, you know, my house too, you know. This isn't my first step to sticking my hand in fucking Pinhead's Box of Horrors.
Like, that is not something I'm interested in at all. So...
Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, I think it's just... The way they're selling it, though, is certainly...
Because I just added my Steam Wishlist. I might buy it after this episode, actually. Like, it's a tenner and it looks...
I really love the art style, actually. That jumps out to me. So, yeah, I'm pleased that they are making these games for you, and I'm pleased that you can continue to highlight these to our listeners, Matthew, who might otherwise miss them.
This is like...
Yeah, I mean... Actually, like, this one had slightly passed me by, and it was... Chris on Edge was a real champion of it.
So, yeah, a big thumbs up to him. Chris Schilling is a great follow on Twitter for, like, good indie recs.
Yeah, I will also... I will second what you said about Edge and, like, game discoverability this year as well. Like, I think that just if you...
You know, like, obviously, I encourage you to read Edge. If you haven't read Edge for a while, I would say, like, look at their Metacritic page and, like, sort it by time. And they have highlighted so much stuff that other outlets have just never talked about or have only talked about a tiny bit.
And, like, it's, you know, like, when you read the magazine, those games really get their moment to shine. And, like, I think it's just... I think it's great to use something that just lives as a standalone print product to curate that stuff, you know, without the kind of, like, worries of SEO.
It's just about game curation for that audience. And I think that's just maybe the best I'm seeing it done these days on Edge. So, yeah, I agree.
It's a good place for that. But, yeah, Paranormal Psych. Good stuff, Matthew.
Very silly name. But I would not... But again, like, why hold that against this genre?
It would rule out so many games, frankly. So, yeah. So, my number six.
I wonder if this is on your list. Cobalt Core.
It's higher on my list.
Oh, interesting. And what's your number five?
It's Cobalt Core.
Interesting. So, shall I...
Do you want to talk about this one? I just talked about Paranormal Sight.
Yeah, okay. So, this was a real late in the day pickup for me. It's got a bunch of basically like plaudits in the last month or so.
People are adding it to various... I've seen it in maybe a couple of game of the year lists, but maybe more in that kind of vein of stuff you might have missed sort of lists. So, yeah.
So many games have tried to riff on FTL, one of my favorite games, and come up with something tangibly worse. I think this game, which is very close in its audiovisual style, like sort of basically sort of a pixel art, sci-fi, spaceships, like one-to-one spaceship combat, basically blends a very similar type of ship combat and visual style and type of music like kind of like, I guess, like slightly chiptune-y, but evocative atmospheric sci-fi music with deck building and card combat, which you've probably encountered in games like Slay the Spire or Inscription or Monster Train. This is like a popular sub-genre in its own right.
And you travel across this galaxy. You take on encounters with normal enemies, tougher enemies, boss enemies. There are some tiles on this, like, map you go across as well that have optional items which give you, like, different, sort of like these items can give you a boost.
There are narrative events as well with different characters. There are, like, repair stations to keep your ship going where you can also upgrade your cards in your deck and upgrade your ship. And then there is, like, a...
Each of your crew members has a specific kind of, like, speciality. So one might be an engineer who specializes in deploying drones. And then there's a, like, meta progression where you can unlock new ships that do different things.
And then also new characters who have different specialities. And then there's also a wider narrative to unpick that you can only finish by doing completed runs of the game. Each run takes about an hour to, like, finish.
But in the FTL style, you might also get blown the fuck up and have to start again. But again, there is still that kind of, like, meta progression to never make it feel like you're completely wasting your time, basically. And you can calibrate the difficulty so it's not too tough on you.
And like I say, I think it's just that FTL journey of, like, let's go on an adventure. We know we need to get to the other side of this. It's combined with, again, taking from subset games, I would say a kind of slightly Into the Breach style self-awareness about the loop-like nature that the characters are stuck in.
Combined with these, I guess generously, Star Fox style character designs. And it's just a really great version of this kind of roguelike space combat game. And you know what, Matthew, I just really fucking love spaceships.
And like this has some good ones in it. It's narrative elements start a little bit softer than FTL, I'd say. Which FTL goes a little bit more for that sort of like slightly Battlestar Galactica-ish sci-fi where it can be a little bit more suicide-bombery.
This is not necessarily in that mold at first. But definitely has a bit of an undercurrent of sadness to the larger narrative. But it's just really fucking great.
And also, you know, like a whole ass strategy game you can play with a controller or on Steam Deck as I'm playing it or on Switch. And it works incredibly well with those controls. Simple, but so much depth to it.
Matthew, thoughts?
Yeah, I think this is fucking brilliant. I almost put it higher. I love this game.
All the reasons you said, like the combination of those things, I think the narrative layer to it feels very post-Hades in that, you know, each loop you complete, you're kind of learning more about the world and then the game kind of moves on and changes things. You know, it's put the repetition into its storytelling in the same way Hades did. And it's also got quite a light touch.
You know, it's more, like you say, more Star Fox than maybe like FTL. If I was Nintendo, I would 100% get these guys to do a Star Fox spinoff. I think that would be amazing.
I think this is like the best Star Fox, and it's not a Star Fox game, but it's kind of like the best Star Fox game in like 15 years or something. Yeah. Because it really puts you in mind of that.
It's that kind of daring do, kind of like animals in space, the hot shot pilot, the amazing gunner, the genius engineer. Like it really sells you on that. I love that in combat, you know, all the moves you're doing are obviously played by pulling cards.
But as well as attacks, there's a lot of focus on like maneuvering your ship. And you can kind of like weave it through firing patterns that you can see incoming on the next turn. And so like where you leave the ship, I think it really captures the energy of a dogfight in this very like static turn take away, which I've not seen before in a game.
I think that's really beautifully done, especially when you start getting like, you can get cards that like make the ship fold up smaller if you end turns in certain conditions. So you can like steer it through these tiny little like, you know, incoming waves of laser death, but just because you played the right cards, you can get your ship to do some mad shit. Oh, it's so good.
The music is fucking rad as well. I love the music in this game. Like the second boss in this, the boss fight theme for that, whenever it happens, it's such a, it's such a banger like to hit like halfway through your run.
It really like lifts you up and powers you through to that final, final stretch. Really, really good shit.
Yeah, I think that that's definitely like, it's definitely worth dialing in more on the combat, like you say there. Like it's the fact that you can build these sort of like monster combos of stuff, where let's say you, what's really interesting is like, there's like a, there's you and then at the bottom of the screen, there's the enemy at the top of the screen. And then in the middle, there's like a layer of things that go in there.
So like basically like they'll launch a missile and it will hang there for a turn and then it will like move forward. And then you can either dodge out of the way. You can like get a certain ability that turns the missile around.
And that's just like one element. You can also, when you kind of get like a little sort of drone launcher specialist basically, you can drop attack drones that will do like one damage each time they fire. But they can obviously be destroyed by the enemy.
You can, you know, like drop once a turn. You can just drop like an asteroid into the, into the, in the way, which will like block an enemy attack. And you can just lay those everywhere.
And that could be the foundation of your strategy. Or you can just have a direct shoot everything strategy. But the deeper you go into it, the more you play with the combos.
That's where you realize that's where the substance of the game really is. They thought so hard about how those different characters interlock in terms of what their different cards do. And then like what you can do with those cards, how much management you can actually do with your deck to like take out redundant cards or upgrade cards that are really meaningful to you.
The ways in which like an enemy can do an attack that will basically inconvenience you with shit cards you have to get rid of. Like it's so well done. And I actually thought at first, I was like a little bit worried that, or skeptical I should say, that it wouldn't have the depth of FTL, but I'm about, I think like six or seven completed runs in and there's still loads more to do.
And to like, it'll be like FTL, where I think I just play it, pick it up and play it perpetually. Man, it's so good. Again, if it's one I would have finished, it might have cracked the top five.
It's definitely, like objectively, absolutely incredible games. So yeah, well done everyone. Good Lord, it's so good.
Well done Cobalt Core. Well done Rocket Rat Games.
Yeah, three people apparently made this. I just, incredible. So, so good.
So I'm telling you, Nintendo, they would be missing a trick not to get these guys to do a Star Fox spinoff. I would be like, you know how that Nintendo worked with Crypt of the Necrodancer and did that Zelda one? They are open to these things.
They should absolutely do that for this. It would be perfect.
I quite like the idea of that. It'd be really hard to write like that much slippy dialogue. Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, this is really good. This, yeah, just, it's funny because it's like FTL, but the sort of like way you interact with it is slightly simpler. So it's kind of like a good way in if you never even played a game like that.
It's also not as hard as FTL, at least like in its basic form. You can make it harder and you will need to unlock more spaceships. But good Lord, Matthew.
So good. God, maybe it should have been higher. Oh, anyway, that's like that was my holiday game.
Well, one of them. So, yeah, amazing stuff. So what are we up?
Are we up my number five?
Yes.
So your Cobalt Core was your number five, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Okay, my number five is Super Mario Wonder. Is this on your list?
It isn't.
Oh, is that one of the big sort of...
That's probably the one. That's the one I feel shitty about.
Okay, so I think that me and Matthew are both sceptical. Well, I suppose I don't want to speak for Matthew here, but we are both a little... Maybe you're both a little bit sceptical about the idea of a new 2D Mario or what that might entail, particularly in a year where that terrible film came out, which, you know, I feel like is kind of like...
I feel like everyone's kind of agreed wasn't very good, but it did happen. It was enormously successful. It's left no cultural footprint, I don't think, so I think there's kind of an element of, oh, this is basically like, you know, New Super Mario Bros.
and the Wii, where it's just going to be the broadest possible Mario for everyone, and then what you realize they've made is essentially 2D Mario with a 3D Mario mentality. So essentially like giving each level a kind of like a core conceit that they can use to mix things up or show you something they've never done in 2D Mario before, and then an escalated version of that when you pick up an item called a Wonder Flower that takes it to the next level where the level will become really, really intense or strange or bizarre, or just basically like push that idea as far as it can possibly go and then wow you with some amazing thing that kind of like riffs on what came before. So I guess like as an example, there's an enemy that can smash through areas of a level in a vertical line.
And then when you take the Wonderflower, they then take up half the screen and enormous chunks of the level are being taken out. We talked about how it very briefly becomes like a top-down Mario game in one level. Or there'll be like a level where you're given like a fireworks launcher that can blow up bits of the environment and you'll just have it for that level and then the idea will go away.
It's like basically like game jam style stuff going on within the framework of one of the most popular series in the world. And that's an amazing thing to behold. And it's, it wows you in all the ways in which I think a great 3D Mario game does.
I think like one thing I will say about it is that it's sort of like those ideas, I think like they are all pretty, across the board, I think this game just dazzles you and made me just audibly go wow like a bunch of times. Some of them are better than others for sure. There are some that are kind of like more in the vein of cinematic set PC, where you're not necessarily, it's kind of more about what you're seeing and hearing as opposed to like the, you're doing something amazing gameplay wise that really knocks your socks off.
That's very, I guess like granular criticism of how they've approached this game. But I think that's okay because you never really know what's coming around the next corner, whether it's like a level where there's like a particular enemy just in that level that eats the level and the level is actually disappearing, so you better fucking get across it because soon it will be gone. That's really cool.
I think it does that while also having like a skill level, which is a bit higher than I thought it would be. So it's never like really so hard that you'll truly struggle with it in the sort of like the critical path of the game. Most of the levels are like definitely doable to a broad audience.
But there are also some optional asides. They're an absolute kick of the nuts, I tell you. Like a truly out of control difficulty where you're like, what the fuck were they thinking?
I'm screaming at my Switch and I'm like, okay, I have to come back to this later. And I suppose like it has to be a shout out as well for the different badges they've added to the games, which functionally give Mario different abilities or, you know, Mario your chosen character, whether it's like allowing him to do successive jumps that make him move slightly higher up and whether it's like adding a kind of like default kind of glide ability, that sort of thing. Just really a very, very generous game at the best possible scenario for what a 2D Mario game could be in 2023, I think.
And so for that reason, it cracks my top five. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I feel really shitty not including this because I think it's a great game and given what was happening in 2D Mario, which was very poor, I felt, for a number of years in the new Super Mario Bros. kind of lineage, not poor, just fine, where what was happening in 3D Mario was so extraordinary. The jumping quality here, you know, from those games to this is wild.
I didn't think they had another 2D Mario like this in them. And so it's maybe churlish of me to then be like, you know, it has the behaviors of a 3D Mario and I start thinking of it in that context. I'm not saying I'm comparing it to the 3D Marios and finding it wanting, but I do find something odd with this game in that it's such a kind of kaleidoscope of mad ideas that I do find a lot of it doesn't really stick for me.
I'm in the moan, I'm like, this is so great, but then I kind of forget half of it afterwards. I can't play it for very long stretches. It's not that it tires me out.
I find it all a little bit too stop-start. There's something about the stage length, and this is why it's a really unsatisfying criticism. Because I'm like, the stages are too short, but there is something a little bit too much throwaway about quite a lot of this game that kind of irks me a bit and stops it from being top tier.
In the same way, it's the same thing that kind of stops me from properly loving Super Mario 3D World.
I thought I could see the parallels there.
And it's the same guy. They basically brought Mr. 3D World into the 2D Mario team to kind of make wonder happen, which is why it is that step up. But he's kind of brought in the traits I didn't like as much from that game.
And when this game is on fire, you are like, this is so good. I mean, there's nothing else like this. And every one of these ideas, of which there are so many, are so polished and sort of fought through, that even if you've seen them for 15 seconds, you know, they are as developed as four characters might be in another game.
And you have to respect it and love it for that. It just doesn't quite click with me in the same way. Look, it's like easy and like a high 8 out of 10 for me.
You know, it's like this is, you know, it was in contention for the bottom of my list. In my heart of hearts, it didn't quite get there for me. I think there's too many little bits where you kind of go into a room and then that guy gives you a thing and then you leave the room and you're like, you know, it's like that sort of mini game, like everything but the kitchen sink.
It's like, well, actually you can put less in this. I think it would probably be better for me. Sorry, this is my miserable take of 2023.
That Super Mario Wonder is like a merely great, given what happened in 2D Mario before. I hate this take that I have.
I think it's a fair enough take. I see what you mean. I think that maybe like the rapid fire idea element is definitely part of why I really like 3D World.
We talked extensively about our contrasting views on that game, and where we both stand, I guess, on 3D Mario generally. I think this speaks to me on that level, in the sense that I think that I really enjoy going through these levels once. There are a couple of people I really want to share these levels with again, and be like, oh, I want to show this to another person and experience this again.
I suppose I fall differently on that scale to you. The other thing I would say is that it's kind of like, how often do you ever play a platforming game where you go around afterwards telling people about this one or two great ideas you experience? They're quite hard to articulate generally.
I mean, I even struggle with it there being like, you carry a fireworks launcher wherever. You kind of just have to behold a lot of the cool stuff in this game, really. You can't necessarily relay it to someone else.
It's hard for them to stick in the memory just because of sheer quantity. You know what I mean?
Yeah, but I think again, some people were burning at the stake for this comparison, but I think of the last 2D platform which I truly loved, which was Rayman Legends, and that has a similar, like every level does something different, but there's a little less of them. I think ideas get to bed in a little bit more, you know, but that's, you know, if you ever told me a world where I prefer a Rayman game over a game, a 2D Mario made by the guy who made Galaxy, I'd be like, well, you know, that's like a I've been replaced by a clone in Kill Me kind of take, you know? But here we are.
Well, that's okay, because I think one of the most interesting things about you and Nintendo is where you do and don't find yourself like agreeing with the larger sort of like population of Nintendo fanboys out there who really like prop this stuff up. And I like it when you are out on something a little bit more than other people. That's interesting to me.
And I think that...
I just don't feel... I still don't feel like I've quite put my finger on what isn't working here for me. That's why I find it unsatisfying to talk about.
I found this a delightful Christmas game. I just finished it. I did a world a day for basically...
Not a week, but the better part of a week. And that was a really great way to experience it. What a fantastic game to unwrap on Christmas Day and just delve into.
Yeah, you're right. I was watching Catherine play it the other day. And every time I looked over at the screen, you'd think it was 12 different games.
So many different things were happening at any given time. And yet here I am. It's no paranormal site.
I suppose what is interesting is that with 2D Mario, with the best will in the world, I think I probably would smush this somewhere between an 8 and a 9, ultimately. And that's like the ceiling for this, I guess. I guess there is still a higher ceiling for 3D Mario.
It's one very cruel takeaway from this game, I suppose. So yeah, interesting. But I think it's terrific.
And if you really took your time with this, and you played one level every few days, that's like an amazing year of playing this game, basically. You're treated to something amazing each time. They're not necessarily meant to be mainlined in the way that we consume games, so that's one other consideration.
That is also true.
Okay, interesting. It's reached my top five, anyway. Okay, so Matthew, do we come to your number four?
Is that right?
My number four is Resident Evil 4.
Higher on my list. We might get through this in under three hours. Oh, maybe.
My number four is probably my most controversial game on this list, so Final Fantasy XVI is my number four.
Oh, not on my list.
Yeah, I didn't think it would be. It's probably the game with the most caveats that's on my list, but it was lower in my top ten, and it has steadily risen in my estimations in the time since I've played it, and I think that's because the peaks in this game are so amazing, dazzling, visually spectacular, wars between gods and nations, that those moments are worth celebrating to me in a year of eight out of ten blockbusters where some of them maybe never quite reached the heights that I want them to. This is a game that has ten out of ten moments in it, even if the game is like an eight out of ten overall.
And that is because the side quests, as discussed in our recent Christmas special episode, are just not nearly as good as they should be. They slow the pace of the game down. There are too many of them.
They have frustrated people across the board. I can completely agree with that as a judgment on this game and a criticism of this game. At the same time, there's really something kind of like impressive about how competent the hack and slash action is in this.
It's Final Fantasy's second foray into this type of combat in the mainline series. It is obviously a step up from how Final Fantasy XV did it. Quite a major step up.
It means that you can treat it as a hack and slash game in a lot of ways. It means that the combat keeps you stimulated throughout the game. Even if you get some repetition from fighting the same enemies or doing the same sets of abilities, it gives you a whole bunch of different movesets to experiment with.
Clive, basically the main character, his whole thing is he can absorb basically the summons of other characters in the game, and it means that he is basically gaining a new sort of like set of abilities themed around each summon each time he does that. And so by the end, you have an absolute ton of them to choose from to interlock and see how they fit together, see what works for you, and what optimally will strip apart like a group of enemies, that sort of thing. Really, really strong.
And I think that coupling that baseline competence of like real time combat, which Final Fantasy has never quite had before, competence is a bit unfair, I guess. Just like a high end approach to that kind of hack and slash combat with this story of this Game of Thrones, their story of warring nations and these kind of like figures who control gods and the story starts with this really broad canvas and then starts getting smaller and smaller as it becomes about this kind of handful of characters. And I think maybe it is at its most exciting in the first half of the game where it does feel like this, much like Game of Thrones, I suppose.
Game of Thrones got less exciting the smaller it felt that world was, right? And I think that this kind of mirrors that a little bit. Just felt like it put Final Fantasy almost in pole position again.
And it felt like a big moment to me. And I was very satisfied by the conclusion, even if I completely agree with the criticism about some of the sort of bumps along the road. Thoughts, Matthew, on me including this one?
No, I get it. Like this was, there's a version of this list, so that appeared. That's definitely one of the ones which was in the soup of great games.
I think there's like a 30, 40 hour version of this game, which is absolutely amazing, which just focuses on the best bits and the core story beats. What I don't get is, it's not just a side quest. There are stretches of the main quest where it kind of switches into side quest mode and you almost have to do some side quest quality stuff to kind of like, you know, help someone out of your base or get someone on side to kind of trigger the next chunk of story.
And it's like, it did not need this padding. Like no one wanted this game to be longer than it is and as long as it is, which is annoying because like the set pieces, the kind of quote unquote dungeon levels when you're actually heading up to a big story boss and the bosses themselves, really, really good fun. Great cast of characters, loved the naughty politics of it all, loved all the weird encyclopedia thing that you could bring up which told you who everyone was.
Like just it felt, it feels so thorough compared to 15, which was so patchy and so much of its thinking. I just can't get over all those side quests and it's a me problem for wanting to do them.
Oh, right.
I just can't, I can't turn that bit of my brain off. I'm like, well, I have to do this stuff. Even though it's making the experience worse for me, I still do it.
I think it pushes you into compromising with it at the very least. That's a fair thing to say about this game. You have to engage with the side quests on some level to reach the adequate level, I think, to beat the bosses and progress.
So I don't think that's just a you problem. In your defense, Matthew.
Yeah, but it's beautiful. There's lots of moments in this where it looks properly next-gen. I'm not just saying this because I've met him a couple of times, but I think the lead character voice by Ben Starr is a great voice performance.
I think the voices in this game are fantastic.
The winner is Ralph Inneson.
I don't know. I'm a real sucker for good British voice acting in a massive AAA game. It's something I loved in the Xenoblade games as well.
I just like hearing regional accents on a global scale. I think that's awesome.
I think Ben Starr is really good. The actress who plays Alan Pratchett's co-host in that show who plays Jill is really good as well. Jill, the character, is maybe a little bit too much of a blank slate, secondary protagonist, female protagonist problem there.
I think she doesn't quite have as much to do as Clive. She's quite passive. The performances are excellent.
I think Square Enix in general just absolutely bosses it with localization. They're just really fucking good at it. Yeah, this is maybe their greatest work yet.
So yeah, really good. It's sort of like all the criticisms are completely fair, but this is a bit of a heart pick, I suppose. It just really got the blood pumping in a way that no other game did for me this year.
And just that very particular blockbuster, look at this fucking amazing thing we made kind of way. So yeah, the Titan Battle is probably the best example of that. But as I mentioned last week, there is a point where some of the summons converge at the end for the final boss.
That is also amazing to look at. And even if you just played the demo of this game, you would have seen a whole bunch of amazing shit. Wow, just such a great game.
It feels complete in a way that Final Fantasy XV never did, as you said, Matthew. So yes, I do not, yeah. It was lower on the list, but fuck it.
It can go a little bit higher. It was a definite high for me. Yeah, exactly.
So we come to your number three, is that correct?
My number three is Baldur's Gate III.
Oh, I've heard of it, yes.
You've heard of it. You're aware of it. Yeah, I mean, what more is there to say about Baldur's Gate III?
You know, this sensational kind of success story. You could have maybe predict it ending this way with early access was very strong and people who were writing about the game in early access, you know, thought they were on to a winner. I am amazed it's blown up into this thing it has, just because it goes against so much accepted wisdom in games in terms of how dense it is, how complicated it is.
There's a combat system which tries to translate the D&D rulebook into video game form and there's a spell book of, I don't know, a thousand spells or something ridiculous, all with strange arcane behaviours and bespoke interface elements. It is not focus tested into this very easy, quaffable AAA experience and yet for some reason, maybe that is the reason, it has absolutely kind of struck a chord with millions of people. A lot of that might be down to the fact that it's an incredibly horny game.
Lots of sort of thirst trap companions. I would say none of them do it for me on that level. They're all just a big bunch of fucking broken weirdos and that isn't my vibe at all.
I know there's a lot of this kind of discourse of I want to fix this fucked up person or whatever and you're like, all these people would be trouble and make your life a misery.
As established. Sorry, the only person you were horny for in a game this year was the evil mum in Final Fantasy XVI as previously established.
They're all a bit of hard work.
What I love about this is it's kind of the opposite of Legend of Zelda II's of the Kingdom, which may or may not feature on my list, in that it's a game where every choice and consequence is accounted for and have been created by writers. It's this incredible like feat of writing flexibility and I still don't really know how they've done it, other than literally sitting there and thinking about every outcome and what could happen and then writing dialogue that fits that outcome, knowing that most people will only experience 1% of what you've written and voiced and motion captured. I think that is how they've done it based on interviews.
It is just time plus writers equals a game that reacts to you in this way. I think that's a huge part of Depeer and what a lot of people are reacting to positively. It's like, wow, whatever hero I bring in, it really respects my choices and not to be too get on my soapbox or whatever, but in this era where people are seeing AI as this cost cutting, we can do anything with the power of AI.
Actually, this game is a testament to artists and what happens when you want to create great, flexible, near infinite art is you just need a huge team of mega brains to sit there and do the hard work and make it work and not just create this experience which reacts to you, but that reacts to you with such character and such heart and such relatability and just recognizable human effort. Not all of it will work. That's also the hallmarks of a human writer.
Like some of it won't resonate with you. You may not like the horniness of the characters. I just, you know, on that level, you know, whatever you think about the overarching story and the mechanics of the combat, you know, I'm into all that.
That's all great. But just, yeah, I just think this game is a testament to effort and human effort. And I don't know.
I think that's like pretty awesome.
Yeah, I think that this scratch is an itch that people have wanted to have scratched since Dragon Age Origins basically, which is that cinematic fantasy game where your choices are respected, like you say, where you have this range of companions you want to spend time with. And at the same time, it feels like this is kind of like the converging of the path that Larian was on with making these slightly immersive sim-infused RPGs. And then suddenly with the present, not suddenly, because the original sin game is building up to this, but just reaching that high level bar of presentation.
And it suddenly being the magic combo that completely unlocks something that all these millions of people have wanted. It reminds me a bit of what happened when Elden Ring came out and there was a bit of talk by a few designers on Twitter about how that game went against expectation or convention of how you meant to start games or how you meant to teach things to people. And I think people are willing to meet you more than halfway on something or at least meet you halfway on something if just what they're getting is just so rewarding.
If they're excited by it, they'll join you on that journey. They'll endure a bit of complexity. They'll maybe even enjoy a little bit of that complexity.
And I think that it's amazing to see a game break out with all that in tow. I still have to actually play it. And I will.
I'd say it's not a mark against it, but it's so dense that it isn't a thing you can dip in and out of. The challenge with Borders Gate 3, and even I found this, it's just finding the time to actually play it and to be able to appreciate it. It's really demanding of you.
It's kind of like, if it hasn't got like five hours to spare, it's almost like meaningless. Because it takes you so long to achieve anything in this game, because there's so much stuff to wade through. And that isn't, I wouldn't say, that's not a problem as such.
It's just a me problem, it's a time problem. I haven't finished this game yet. I'm still playing it because of that.
It's like, when do I ever have time to do it? And it's a bit too beastly for a Steam Deck. I think you can get it working on a Steam Deck, but you know, it's like PC or Bust.
So I begrudgingly... Anything which sort of tethers me to my PC, I'm always a bit cross about. Otherwise, it might have been...
Maybe it could have been number one, if I'd been able to play it more easily away from my PC.
I did, so I've got it on PS5, and I think that's gonna be a good way to play it, I think, just on my TV, and it's got the power for it.
Yeah, there is that, too.
Yeah, I agreed on the deck thing, though. I saw it, and I was like, well, it's pretty amazing they got it running on there, but it's also just... You need just a little bit more power, because it is a visual powerhouse, I think, so...
Yeah. Yeah, I will get through it. How far are you through it, if you don't mind me asking?
Oh, pretty far, like into third act.
Okay, nice. And you've been playing it a bunch during Early Access as well, right?
Yeah, I think that's what slowed me out the gates, because I was replaying something I'd played three times. And rather than speed me through it, I was slowing down going, oh, I was mis-remembering things. It just arrived at the worst time, and Gamescom happened, and...
Sausagegate, yeah, all this stuff.
Sausagegate, I lost my pass. Did I tell you about that?
Yeah, there's a WhatsApp chat I'm in where people use you after you ate those two sausages as a react emoji to express pain.
I haven't given my permission for that.
I don't think it'll spread any further.
At least tell me, are they people I know?
Some of them are, yeah.
Oh my god, strangers. Strangers are using what they just know as the sausage man. Have you explained my backstory?
I've told them you're a great guy.
You shouldn't be able to use emojis of me unless you've met me. That's a rule.
Fair enough. It's beloved former Frontier colleagues, just some of my favorite people. They're all good people, don't worry.
I promise you.
What does it mean? It means it's a signal.
Someone says something that just appalls them or makes them feel terrible. They'll just use that.
On the appalling react.
Every time I see it, I always have to blink twice. I forget that Matthew Castle has been... You just shouldn't have allowed yourself to be photographed after you ate those sausages.
That's a mistake by you.
I think there's four reactions of me in the work slack. One of them is me looks like I'm about to drink a can of beef. And it's called Beef God.
I don't know what that signifies. Whenever I see that, it makes me laugh. There's another one where I'm sticking my head through a crack, a bit like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.
But I think that's got a bit of pervy energy. Who's this perv coming for a little pee rather than I'm coming to kill you?
I think what you need to understand, Matthew, is you are an absolutely cracking cult figure. You're an absolute belter, really. Just a great time to ambiently be associated with you.
This podcast is testament to that, I think. What was the first one, Beef? What was that one called again?
Beef God.
Beef God, that's so good. I want to see that so badly. Now, please send me a picture of that when you're back in the office.
I'd like to see Beef God.
So that was...
That was Sport Escape 3.
Of course. Yeah, so I will definitely get to it and talk about it at some point. I realize it's a major omission on my part, but like I said, I don't want to force it a few hours, put it at number eight and then just piss everyone off.
I might as well just admit I didn't get to it this year. It was a busy year. My number three then is Pizza Tower on PC.
Whoa.
Yeah. Is this a surprise to you? I tried to keep this one a little bit under wraps, but if you follow me on Blue Sky, you might have seen it, Matthew.
I told you to talk about it. I'm more like I'm doing my calculations about what's left on this list. And hang on.
No, well, that can't be right. Well, we'll get to it. It can't be right.
I mean, no, it can't be.
Hang on. OK. So Pizza Tower is a 2D platformer inspired by the Wario Land series.
I'm just going to read out the plot of the game here because I think it's basically just there's a madcap 90s Nickelodeon energy to this game in general and how it looks and sounds. And it just has a little bit of that feel. So Papino's Spaghetti, a surprisingly agile and powerful fat-balding Italian is on a mission to destroy the titular pizza tower in order to save his restaurant from annihilation.
Follow him through his rampage across many wacky floors of the tower, collecting toppings and beating up monsters. Players Papino's Spaghetti, the supersonic Italian middle-aged man and sometimes Gustavo, who is another character. So that's the kind of like plot.
You play this sort of like very frantic, stressed, anxious looking man who, you know, in another context could be like a Safdie Brothers kind of protagonist. He has that sort of energy. He's kind of like indie game warrior, I suppose, is kind of his vibe.
I think this might objectively be the best game of the year. It is a 2D platformer built on ideas in the same way Mario Wonder is, but with more precision and it's more about skill, pure platforming. It has these incredibly precise mechanics.
If the spark shine bits and Metroid Dread fucked you up as you got to secret areas, this is essentially a whole game of them. You are bouncing around levels, you're jumping, sliding, running up walls, and each level you essentially run to the end, hit this big block thing with a face, and then you have to sprint out of the level back to the entrance. My understanding is, Matthew, this is basically what Wario Land 4 was all about on Game Boy Advance.
This game is indebted to that. It mentions Wario Land on the Steam page, so they completely own that, but it's a whole game built of that, and I believe it's a much more hardcore version of that kind of experience. So it asks a lot of you, and each there are 20 levels in the game, and most of them have either a theme or a central idea as a hook.
So in one level, you have a sword. In another level, you'll be able to turn into a ghost. There'll be a level where you can ride a pig sausage or a dead body to speed up across the map.
You'll have boss fights with one-off mechanics where you get like a gun or something. There's always something to define each level when they're all visually very distinct from each other. There's five different floors you go up in this game.
You're essentially going around levels, collecting these like weird little dudes who are basically pizza ingredients. There's like a little cheese man, a little tomato man. And each of them give you money, and you need that money to be able to unlock new floors to reach more levels and progress.
There's loads of optional stuff in each level as well, different challenges, that sort of thing. But it's just like it puts so much power in your hands to master the game. And even if you never get anywhere close to mastering it, you will experience its greatness.
You will be dazzled by it. And I've been on such a journey with this game, because I first played it and I found the Nickelodeon theme of it a bit arch and annoying and millennial and smug. And so I actually refunded it on Steam.
I was so angry, angered by the theme and how hard it was. I was like, I fucking know, I'm not dealing with this. I'm just going to go play Final Fantasy or whatever.
So refunded it and then I just heard just more and more positive things. It has, this is the game I mentioned earlier that has like almost no critical reviews, but 44,000 Steam reviews. Like it's a proper sensation this year.
And all those people I thought couldn't be wrong and they are not. This is, you stick with it and it will just dazzle you. Another thing it reminds me of actually is I think in the economy of it, as in it doesn't have like loads and loads of levels that recycle the ideas.
It has like a finite amount of levels and then the right amount of ideas to fit in those levels. It reminds me a bit of Gunpoint where no mechanic really outstays its welcome because there is just that, you know, it's edited in the right way. It's just that that precision of like, we want this to last for as long as this and it just works so well.
It's just like, just it's so demanding but so exciting, so exhilarating when you're doing well at it and very frustrating when you feel like you just haven't like got your head around completely how all of these different maneuvers work. End up, you know, kind of sliding under things and like bouncing up at levels and sometimes you need to run away from a big monster they just dispatch to chase you at the end of a level and it really fucks you up. That's the other interesting thing about this.
It's a platform where you can't die but you can fuck up in almost every other conceivable way. Like you can just be slowed down, you can sort of go down like the wrong path, you can just be the sort of battered sort of endlessly and your score go down. It finds loads of ways to sort of shame you for being rubbish.
And then when you do succeed it's so, so rewarding. So I just have to like give it to this game. It is pure magic and it's kind of perfect on PC.
It hasn't been put on consoles and I don't think they're going to do that. And it has like this almost like cursed flash game energy to it. It is always perfect for PC.
So is this surprising this has made my list, Matthew?
Well, not really in thinking about it in terms of, you know, I know that the Pizza Tower momentum has been like building behind the scenes, yet for some reason didn't kind of dive in myself. Like I'd heard about the kind of, oh, it's like an indie Wario Land thing, which, you know, I like the Wario Land games. I wouldn't say I'm obsessed with them.
So it's not something I kind of was like, well, I must play that, you know, like that's absolutely essential for me. But yeah, I mean, you know, you've sold it to me there for sure. And, you know, it sounds absolutely amazing.
I was just looking at some little clips of it. I don't think I'd actually seen it in motion. And yeah, it looks like wild as hell.
I love the animation style. And I like the idea that, you know, weird, deviant Wario kind of would inspire this act of homage. And it looks like it's suitably demented.
You know, it has that kind of, like you say, the kind of Nickelodeon cartoon thing. Yeah, I have no idea why this is passing by. I'm just too lazy, too conventional.
It's a perfect Steam Deck game, which is probably self evident from looking at it. And the animation really is amazing, like just the amount of like weird shit his face is doing at any one time. Like I say, a very stressed looking man.
And there is also, there is actually some like deeper story stuff that people have been doing the old YouTube deep dives on. I want nothing to do with that. I'm just here to appreciate the great ideas that drive 2D platforming.
I will say actually, in general, if you had told me at the start of this year, I'd have two 2D platformers in my top five games of the year. I never would have believed you. But that has somehow happened.
I think I've even said in this podcast that I've experienced all the joys that a 2D platformer can give me, and I'm good now, dog. Not counting Metroidvanias and that. But I felt like there was a drop off at some point of 2D platformers being a big concern in the indie space, and then this and Mario between them.
It's nice to be proven wrong in such amazing ways and in such different ways as well. So yeah, Pizza Town, man. It's really something, I will say that.
So we come to your...
Also a very good advert for if you're inspired by a Nintendo game, make your own game rather than a weird fan game that then gets fucking fried by lawyers on the internet. Make your own thing which sells more copies than probably Wario Land has actually sold.
Yeah, but I think that's actually part of its magic as well. It's an homage to something so precise in Nintendo's back catalogue. You know when you're looking at a game that riffs on Link's Awakening, you get it straight away.
But when you're looking at this, you're like, that's a much more precise part of the Nintendo catalogue to sort of zoom in on. So I really appreciate that about it. But yeah, it's very good, Matthew.
So we come to your number two, right?
Yes, which is Shadow Gambit, The Cursed Crew.
Of course, of course.
The final game from MeMeMe sadly shut their doors this year just after releasing this. I think this feels like it was a final roll of the dice for them. Well, actually, I say that.
I think some of the messaging around their closure actually sounds like the guys who kind of run it and owned it were like, we're just sort of done. It's not like this is so dire. It's more like, you know, we could enter the whole process of finding work for hire to keep everyone here, but like, we just can't do that process anymore.
Like, we are just too tired and too dumb. And so, fair play to them. I think in their time that they were active, they basically renewed this real time stealth tactics genre, perfected it.
I would be amazed if anyone ever does as good a job as this ever again. You know, we're talking about games like Commandos and Desperados back in the day, kind of updated literally in Desperados 3. This is a standalone game of a new IP that they created about zombie pirates.
Took all the ideas that made Shadow Tactics and Desperados 3 amazing, you know, these beautiful isometric maps, this very ingenious interplay between characters with very set skillsets that are designed to kind of like complement each other, the ability to kind of pause the action, set up these chain reactions of amazing takedowns using all these different powers, really, really like sublime stuff. I'd say any of these three games is an amazing, amazing, like sort of 10 out of 10 time for me. What they decided to do with the formula in this one was to give you a huge crew of zombie pirates and a lot more kind of freedom in building your team.
So in the previous games, they controlled a lot of the challenges by giving you set characters for each mission. Here, you can take all different characters in, so you can find all these mad new synergies between them. It maybe makes for like weirdly a slightly easier game than Desperados and Shadow Tactics because they can't like perfectly hone that challenge for this exact character group combination.
They have to create these challenges which can be tackled from multiple angles by an infinite variety of teams that you may be bringing in. Because of that, it's maybe a little softer, but it's still as ingenious and as satisfying to play. The powers of them, just classic kind of tropes like the sort of spy who can go undercover, a sniper, you've got someone who can plant bushes, so you can make new cover to break line of sight.
And I just think the way that they kind of take the, you know, maintain that kind of core magic of their previous games, but kind of grow it out into this bigger world, whether that's with that freedom to pick your team when you go in, the ability to approach these more sandbox islands from multiple directions, which changes how the levels play out, or even in between the missions, you go back to your boat, you spend time with your crew, you do like weird little comic side stories, which kind of like tutorialize their powers and introduce the characters at the same time, and it just feels like a more complete game. I guess in a similar way to what we were talking about, like Nintendo with Pikmin and Mario this year, it's just like this is a team that's taken the thing they do well and just made sure every bit of it sings, and it's as full and complete an idea as it can be. So if this is their last game, I think they've really gone out on a high with it.
They could be really proud that they never put a foot wrong, and I hope more people will discover this moving forward. It just didn't feel like it made a huge splash this year, but it's always going to be there. Just a fucking great game.
And very playable on console. I played a lot of this on PS5, actually, which normally you'd think it would be the domain of the mouse and the keyboard, but it plays very nicely on the pad.
Yeah, I think this is the other thing, actually, I might have been alluding to earlier when I said how it's been a bad year for certain types of games. And I think the fact that they can no longer exist, having made this, you know, maybe the best game they've made in this particular mould, and there's not space for it in a world where people would probably buy a million copies of XCOM 3 if they released it tomorrow, is a real bummer that it's adjacent enough, surely, that more people would enjoy this if they just played it and found it. So it is a real bummer that the studio who have mastered this type of game just no longer exists.
That's actually terrible. That's actually like a travesty, really. So I'm sorry to hear that, but also, you know, it's really cool that this last game has dazzled people.
The console thing is probably a good thing. It is a good thing to mention to our listeners who might be curious about trying it and don't want to sit at desktop necessarily to give this a go. It is on my list.
I own this. I will play it at some point, Matthew. But yeah, it's one last shout out for me, me, me on this podcast.
Yeah, it's grand to have it in your list. So I did make number one, though, which I assume will be Bayonetta Origins, Saraitsa and The Lost Demon. I look forward to discussing that shortly.
Okay, so my number two is Resident Evil 4 Remake, which was lower down on your list. So put this super high. So why did I put this so high?
It's because I think that it was the least necessary remake in the world. We didn't need it. We had Resident Evil 4 on every single platform imaginable, including VR.
We didn't need Capcom to remake this. So it really had to prove itself and be necessary, which was like a monstrously difficult task. And they did it.
And in doing so, I think also made the best third person action game maybe ever in terms of raw mechanics. And I believe that more and more as I've dipped into the mercenaries mode and just found the mechanics so robust. And it's, you know, it is taking what Resident Evil 4 already did.
It's taking little bits and pieces of what they learned making Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes and then it's applying those back to the original Resident Evil 4 formula and having this kind of like high-octane action approach to survival horror gameplay, which is still just absolutely magic. And to modernize that and not lose the germ of what was perfect about it in the first place while also hitting a lot of the... hitting almost all of the same beats from the original game, expanding on some bits.
We've talked about the mine... the minecart sequence in this game extensively on here, pushes the narrative in some cool ways. The Ashley stuff is much more compelling in this, much scarier.
It is a little bit spookier than the original game. I think I'd hand it that. It's nice to be surprised by bits of Resident Evil 4 that you've forgotten.
I think this remake does a good job of doing that. It doesn't feel like it's necessarily trying to do exact... to achieve all of the same things.
It knows it has to accomplish certain things, but it's also happy to just chuck in a couple of side quests. Have you spent a bit more time on the lake than you maybe did in the original? And that sort of thing.
It feels like there's not necessarily the same creator's hand at work with it. I think I really appreciate that about it because the essence of Resident Evil 4 is still here. Like I say, it's just the gun place.
It's fucking out of this world good. And so, I don't mind rewarding it as highly as I have here. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I love this game. It has been a constant source of bafflement to me to see people going, oh, this shouldn't really be nominated for Game of the Year because it's just a remake. And you're like, have you played it?
It's not just a remake. Even if it was the case, it's still, you know, whatever. Let's not get into the terms and conditions of Game of the Year eligibility.
But yeah, I completely agree. Like, I think the places they've massaged it and changed it are perfectly valid. I think, you know, there are still a few places where it feels a little weak, but I'd argue maybe those are the same places.
The original didn't quite nail it either. Crucially, at the heart of it is just whatever they do to kind of maintain that stressful bullet economy that sense that you've got to make everything count, that these things are moving towards you. Every shot counts.
Maybe it doesn't, but there's some, like, incredible dark resource witchcraft going on to give you the impression that every shot counts. It's one of the very few games that really nails that tension. It's kind of thrilling to play.
It's kind of thrilling to watch, actually. I've seen a lot of people playing this just in the office this year for various things, and every time I always get into it, like, you know, if that is just a trick it's taken from the original, then, you know, congratulations. They've done it brilliantly and managed to kind of not lose the magic while making it feel relevant and importantly shiny for this current generation.
And also really well supported with, like, DLC, which I haven't played yet, and the free VR mode, which is excellent. Like, Capcom just really going all out to kind of impress with these things. You've got to hand it to them.
Yeah, the DLC is fantastic. That's actually the other thing that pushed it slightly further up the list to me. It was better than it had to be by, you know, by miles and miles.
And also it was like £7.99. You can just buy this game for like £25 now, and that's phenomenally generous. I think that what was great about this was, like, when I would go in tentatively thinking, well, is this going to be the same?
Like, the village sequence at the start is probably the best example of this. And then it gets your blood pumping in all of these different ways. It doesn't feel the same.
But you remember what it was like when that set piece was fresh to you the first time you played it, and it's become so predictable, obviously, on replays because I think Resident Evil 4, the original, is a highly replayable game, and most people I know have played it four or five times because it is that good. And yet, it would surprise me. I just remember laughing out loud when I climbed up the ladder to the tower, and the floor gave way, and then I just had to keep fucking moving, thinking, oh, I was safe up there, and then I wasn't, and just so, so good.
And that would just keep happening. It would just, you know, like the Krauser fight and the way in which it would weave in the new knife mechanics they added to the game. That's why you can't say this is just like the same game again because it is a new game built on the bones of Resident Evil 4.
I do agree that it's like, it's the most interesting case in the kind of like argument of do you need to remake games. It is that. I will come to that.
It's not the same, it's not as necessary a remake as Resident Evil 2 was, arguably. But it's just fucking great. And if you love Resident Evil 4, you've played it so many times now that it can no longer dazzle you in the same way.
I agree, I think there's a real reason for this to exist in the sense of like, it's nice to have Resident Evil 4 refreshed for yourself. I got to play that PSVR 2 mode. That looks fucking great.
I had so many ads for that when I was in Japan, actually. And it just looks so, so good. I've got to give that a go at some point.
It just looks like, there's fucking two VR versions of Resident Evil 4 now. That's amazing. So yeah, okay, good.
I think it deserves to be this high up. But I didn't give it number one. Maybe that's my one cop to the people demanding it doesn't have, it's not eligible, Matthew.
So, we come to your number one, Matthew.
My number one, of course, The Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom, the much celebrated video game adaptation of the best trailer of the year. The absolutely sublime saxophone music, god damn I love that trailer. The build up to this game in April, Unreal, how many times I watched that thing, that two and a half minute trailer.
Special shout out to that. Yeah, Tears of the Kingdom. Again, kind of like Super Mario Bros.
Wonder where I struggled to put my finger on exactly why that wasn't quite doing it for me. I still find this game quite hard to summarize and celebrate. I know that when I'm playing it I'm playing a genuine masterpiece and one of the greatest games of all time.
A game which has easily supplanted Breath of the Wild in my estimations. And yet, faced with a wave of non-believers, I do find it kind of difficult to go with. Here's the line which kind of sells you on Tears of the Kingdom or summarizes why it's magic.
I think that's in part because it goes in so many different directions. On the very base level you have a sequel to Breath of the Wild doing quite conventional sequel work. Here are these characters, here are these places, here's what happens to them down the line.
Things have moved on and you get to return to these locations and discover how things have changed. On a narrative level, that's quite exciting. I still think that's quite an un-Nintendo thing to do.
They don't tend to dwell on that kind of direct timeline connection in these games. You know, they always move on to passage news. So just getting to go back to these places and see, like, you know, it's all the Gorons who are basically in the middle of like a fucking opioid crisis.
What's going on with that? That's mad. And, you know, you go to this beautiful town and it's all become frosted over and like the music's all chilly in wintery and that's a bit of like a basic bitch kind of, I'm just making my way through this game and enjoying the differences of this place, which I have loved and am loving again.
Obviously on top of it, there's new areas to discover. Up in the sky, down in the depths, I think both mechanically feel very different. Up in the sky is this world of kind of crazy invention where just the space between things forces you to really dig into the game's crafting system, use the Ultra Hand to build these devices to basically conquer the skies and move between these disparate elements.
Where down in the depths, you know, it's a much more kind of tentative, nervous progress. You know, I don't want to say it's a survival game. Like, I think that's overselling it.
There are elements that make it more inhospitable, which I find very engaging. I really love both the sky and the depths in the middle. I love how the three of them connect.
I love how different the three of them feel. It's interesting, I've seen some people criticize the depths because they say, well, it's just a big boring space that I spend tens of hours just walking around to kind of clear it all out. That's never how I approach this game.
I think what I love about Tears of the Kingdom more than anything is how totally freeform it is in that it has all these ideas and you're free to kind of engage with them as much or as little as you want. It can be a game where, yes, you go down to the depths and you spend 20 straight hours slogging it out against like giant nasty beasts in the darkness, but it can also be a place which you go down to collect a specific resource because you want to bring it up to the surface to achieve something, or you want to take it to the skies and achieve something. And I love that, whether I happen to fall into a magic rhythm, I love the rhythm I did find, and I found that this was a game, a very rare example of an open world game, which didn't feel like it was channeling me in any way, and I guess the same for Breath of the Wild, but with so many more things going on, I really felt I could kind of pick or choose, and especially with the building system, which is normally something I hate in games, I hate crafting, I hate systems which feel like I'm not making the most of them.
I feel like a lot of building systems and a lot of user-generated content, it makes 1% of players feel clever and they get to go on Twitter and show off all the amazing shit they made, and everyone else is making dumb monstrosities. And actually here I found the things I was making followed a logic where I could imagine better things and then they'd happen and they'd work, and I just felt constantly good about that. So of all the things it does, that's probably the gaming hurdle, which I didn't think a game would ever get me over, which was to really love that kind of experimental, mechanical edge.
I'm not in real life a mechanical engineering or a machine. I'm not interested in machines. I haven't got that kind of mind.
But here it kind of adheres to this cartoon logic, which I thought was just so clever, the way that it just works, you know? This isn't like Banjo and Kazooie, Nuts and Bolts, where you build all this shit that has never moved, because the game was like, well, it doesn't physically work. This is the thing where it went, I kind of get what you're going for.
That's the Nintendo difference. They're like, I see what you're doing here. You want that wheel to move these things, that will work.
This will always work. And that to me is just mind-blowingly clever. The ability to deliver Nintendo's peerless eye for quality control, but to marry it to a system which defies authorial control in a way, because it's so sprawling.
That's where the seven years went. Just making something and make sure it actually works. Yeah, I just thought that was incredible.
I think this is like an all-timer. And it genuinely makes me a little bit sad when people aren't into it as much as I am. But that is okay.
Yeah, so I mean, I sort of like, I think it's... I'm really glad you're engaged with that crafting system in the way that you did. It is good to hear you make the point about how you felt that its elegance enabled you to make things, elaborate things that you would never normally bother to make in a game that was more fiddly or where the logic was a little bit more warped.
I think that's a really nice way to sort of praise what this game does well. It is absolutely packed with stuff, a very generous game in terms of ideas that kind of like weave in the pre-existing set of Breath of the World mechanics and principles and physics and all that stuff with all of these new abilities they've given you, the ability to rewind time and the ability to ascend through solid objects and pop out of the top and all these different ways they've given you to interact with the world. I think that's all completely fair.
I guess I suppose this is where I jump in and say the game did leave me quite cold. And that's not to say I think it's bad. I don't think it's bad at all.
I think that one area in which I found it dated or slightly frustrating was the melee combat specifically. Like it's all limited. I think that that's one area where I wish it had moved along a little further.
I think it's the fact that you do just have the one swipe and the one dodge and you kind of just do the same thing over and over again. And I know that there are obviously the Ultra Hand allows you to weld new weapons together. But I think that quite gives it that one area of the game didn't move along enough that I actually sort of started to dread one on one encounters with enemies a little bit because I wish that had just a tiny bit more sophistication to it.
But it is kind of countered by the fact that the ranged combat is made so exciting by the way you can attach items to arrows and experiment with the different ways in which that will mess with enemies. All of the things they've done with the game, the layers they've built on top of Breath of the Wild make total sense in terms of bringing more out of it. And I definitely will praise the game for that.
Even if I don't think the crafting, I didn't find it. I think just found the interface of it a little bit more fiddly, a little bit more clunky. But the thing is I just didn't fall in love with it because I think the one thing you just have to acclimatize to is the fact that it's not about discovery in the same way that Breath of the Wild is about discovery.
That's a game about discovering a map for the first time. This is a game about discovering what you can do within a world you already know. Sorry, John.
No, I was going to say that's absolutely what it is. It can't be the first thing.
No, it can't. And that does require more imagination from the player than Breath of the Wild does, where that discovery is very surface level. You can see it straight away.
It's the first time you've done any of the... The first time you've climbed something and seen that little circle ticking down as Link's running out of stamina. It's the first time you've gone up into the mountains and you've experienced what it's like when the temperature drops and you suddenly have to wear the old warm doublet to survive up there or light a fire.
All of that stuff is here, but then the eureka moments, they do come from things that you have to drive as a player. It trusts you to go along with it in that way. I guess I can admit that I have a gap there where I don't have the imagination or the patience to truly get that out of it in the way that you have.
But that's not to say I think it's bad. I just didn't love it.
But I don't mind seeing it on Game of the Year list. That's good.
I know people have been anticipating the great Roberts Castle rift coming out of this. But I think everything you've ever said is absolutely fair. Even when we did the original episode, I think it's an incredibly risky move from Nintendo in that they've given you something so open and free form.
They give you all the rope to hang yourself and have a bad time.
Definitely, yeah.
And if that happens, then that happens. And so be it, but they're also, therein lies the same potential for you to really feel like you've discovered something you've never seen or experienced before. I found that to be genuinely mechanically profound in places.
I can't believe this thing worked and look what I'm doing now and look what I've achieved. But I know that comes from the same place as The Frustrations. It's a distinctly un-Nintendo game that they've made in that regard.
It's incredibly experimental. Narratively experimental. You can miss the story.
You can play the story out of order. You can get to places way before you're meant to get to them. You could accidentally find the thing which is the narrative payoff to something else.
Everything Nintendo games aren't really meant to be. The perfect handcrafted worlds. And this is one of the first times I've just sensed Nintendo just remove that hand entirely and go, we've done our best to try and make everything here work.
We've left this in the best possible state we can that we hope you're going to have fun in it. We hope you're going to enjoy it. And let's see what happens.
And its prominence on Game of the Year lists speaks to the people who did gel with it. But at the same time, it's, you know, it's valid. It's perfectly valid.
I'm not annoyed, Sam. I'm just disappointed.
The first episode we did, I was just like, I think it was just a raw shock of the fact that I didn't love it. It was like a little bit of mourning of, I really thought this was like an absolute shoo-in for me. And then the fact that I just couldn't, I just felt like I spent ages in those floating islands.
And then when I got down to the world, I just didn't have any sense of like, oh, wow, look at it. I just had a sense of, oh, I've been here before. And then it was like, yeah.
But then over time though, it's subsided a little bit. And it's more like, there's a few other things.
I'm going to read them all.
I'm going to read them all. I'm going to read them all. I'm going to read them all.
I'm going to read them all. I'm going to read them all. I'm going to read them all.
I'm going to read them all. I'm going to read them all.
I'm going to read them all. I'm going to read them all.
And I also appreciate that if anyone is going to give this game the chance to succeed, it is me. I went in and I wanted this to be amazing and I gave it every opportunity to amaze me in the same way that I did not approach Starfield in that way. I did not put in the hours to make sure to see if the things there would eventually click.
I don't think they will. I'm not saying I think there's Tears of the Kingdom quality game hiding away in Starfield. That isn't the point.
But like if any game gets the gets the fairest of shots, it is going to be the new Zelda or Mario from me. And I do appreciate that. So I don't want people to think that like, you know, I'm blind to, you know, I'm speaking about someone who's played, you know, 150 hours of this thing.
Where I'm at with the game now is completely different to where I may have been with it originally or along that journey or whatever.
Yeah. And I start to say that I just haven't. I've been cold on all of it because it's frequently impressive.
I love the ways in which sometimes...
Quite for the box.
Well, I think it's just that... I think the thing I have to snap out of is the thing you were talking about earlier, the idea of not getting too bogged down and having to tick off everything. And I think that is where you can bum yourself out with this game if you feel like you need to go after every corak or you need to lift up every sign that that jeb ends going around with.
Stuff that is optional, you can just skip it and then you can focus on the things you actually care about, which is how I played Breath of the Wild. I need to recalibrate my brain to that. This is how I played it.
I didn't do everything. I just kept chasing the horizon and doing whatever I thought was cool on the horizon. So that's how I enjoyed that game and I will play more of this and I will see through the main quest and I will get there.
The other thing I try to keep in mind is that I remember when I was on X360, 2009, I remember complaining about how conservative I found Mario and Zelda at that time. Not Mario Galaxy, but New Super Mario Bros and Twilight Princess. I just thought, why don't these things ever really move along?
The whole narrative of Twilight Princess was people talking about how it went back to what they liked from Ocarina of Time. I think at that time, I thought of Nintendo as being very creatively conservative. When they're making this, it completely defies that impression I had.
Completely chucks it out as an observation. I really respect the fact that they have done that. Gosh, I haven't given up on it, but I just didn't fall in love with it.
But I'm glad that you did.
Yeah, well, that's okay. Listen, that was a sprawling mess of a justification. Like I said, I still haven't got this one down.
One day I'll speak 20 seconds of beautiful words about Tears of the Kingdom. That will move everyone greatly. Today isn't that day.
I think Simon Parkins' words about this game are the best I've read about it. He's sort of bald. I can't remember where his review was now.
Was it the New Yorker? That was the best piece of writing. That's the piece of writing that's stayed with me about what this game does well.
Yes, while I have been a little dick about it on Discord, Matthew, probably winding you up for no real reason, what I say is sincere, so I hope you take it as such. Okay, great. That's your number one.
Tears of the Kingdom is your number one. My number one, gosh, I wrestled over this. My number one is Star Wars Jedi Survivor.
So this is as close to a complete package for an original blockbuster game as we got this year, I think. It's a great main quest that respects your time. It feels like a linear game when it wants to have that naughty dog style forward momentum in narrative and give you those big amazing set pieces.
Yet it feels like an open world game when you want to dip into the very good side stuff and see what's out there and explore, which is an amazing balancing act. I really think that as a Star Wars game, it's like as good as it's going to get in the modern age. It's got a main character and a supporting cast who you are a bit like Spider-Man 2, I think, where the writing is good enough that you're tuned in to what they're saying.
You're not frustrated by spending time in their company. You're not skipping cut scenes for the sake of it. Combat-wise, it's a massive step along from Jedi Fallen Order.
It still has the kind of like Dark Souls style progression at its core and a little bit of the sort of like Zedlock kind of like combat approach as well. But it's a really strong version of lightsaber combat. This has the addition of like new stances which really mix up the game in some exciting ways.
My favorite being the blaster stance. Blaster in one hand, lightsaber in another. As I said on a previous episode, let's just fucking do Luke Skywalker and Han Solo at the same time.
I love that shit. That's really good. Really fun to experiment with those.
I think like my two areas where I have notes is not all of the bosses are up to scratch in terms of balancing and I found myself screaming at the last boss and let's say an encounter with a key Star Wars figure, which is a similar beat to what they do in the first game, but I found it quite frustrating here, unfortunately. I also thought the story was a touch worse than the previous one in terms of like I think the first game did a really good job of dealing with the idea of like all these characters who had raw trauma and hadn't processed it, but were trying to do so in this kind of like the doomed kind of like Empire controlled galaxy where they no longer felt like they had a place. I just really like that idea and this game though I think does a good job of pushing the Cal Kestis character along a little bit and I do think it has a couple of absolutely killer twists really really good that took me completely off guard.
And yeah, some great spectacular levels and surprisingly good platforming as well. It's a blockbuster that doesn't play itself, it asks you to master it and I really appreciate that and yeah, I really think it's like, yeah, it's really close to a nine for me and I think like it's a little bit of heart picking here but I think objectively as well it just like, I just see, I see the thinking behind all the decisions, I see what led them to this and it just feels like I'm totally on the same page as them in terms of here's what a blockbuster should be, it shouldn't speak down to the player, it should respect their time but if you want to stay in this a lot longer, we'll give you some great ways to do that. I just see all the great decisions that led to this game being as good as it is and so it's a shame that the performance stuff kidnapped the narrative of this game, Matthew, because this is really up there, this is like a console exclusive level blockbuster from EA and Resport and so well fucking done, I hope they get to make a third one.
Thoughts Matthew?
Yeah, I absolutely love this game, it was lower on my list but you know, I'm not as big a Star Wars head, I really, you know, I thought it sold me on all the big Star Wars fantasies like the different planets you go to, like the variety of them and the amazing vistas and like the surprising amount of space covered in this game, like a lot of these levels are a lot bigger than they end up being, which supports some pretty great Metroid-y style backtracking with new abilities to get to new places and the levels just keep opening up and there's always something interesting if it's a special boss fight or you know some new power or whatever going on behind it, I've really well judged. I think you can tell that, you know, this has got Stig Asmussen who obviously made Back Page favorite God of War 3 and this has, but it has like similar eye for like great set pieces and great scale of like, let's pull the camera back and you'll see like a giant crash spaceship and it'll look like the raddest thing ever. There's just loads of it as well and it like brilliantly paced.
Yeah, great powers. That thing you said about like, you really play it all, none of it's automated, none of it feels like it's just there to like mask loading. You know, it feels like I'm having to engage with like wall running and gymnastics.
It's got a bit of that Titanfall DNA in there too. Yeah, it's really class act. It's funny you said you didn't like the fight against the iconic character.
Maybe I don't remember the fight itself. I remember it being fucking difficult, but that set piece is great as a whole, because you're like, you know, because of where it falls, like certain things can and can't happen. But in the moment, you're like, oh shit, I'm doing this.
And I really loved that. I thought that was great. That was a real highlight this year.
Yeah, especially as a character who I, let's just say that character has some squandered potential elsewhere in Star Wars.
Yeah.
Also, I think this was quite a particularly bad year for Star Wars stuff, like the Mandalorian was all over the place, Ahsoka, I thought was terrible, apart from that Clone Wars flashback episode was actually really good, but the rest of it was terrible. So I think I've been I think that has compounded my sort of frustration with Star Wars this year. So the fact that like a game, this game is sort of the standout is actually like, you know, really speaks to how, how amazing that team is.
Yeah, just, yeah, it's wonderful, wonderful, generous game. And I don't know if they have solved all of the performance issues. But if that's the reason that it stopped people from checking out that would be a fucking shame because it's just so so good.
This is like, this is what you want from blockbusters. This is like, this is EA making the stuff that people say EA doesn't make, you know. It's happening.
So yeah, gosh, it really was great. And I will go back and tick off some of the other side's stuff at some point. But even if like they they don't always make Star Wars, as long as the ethos behind this game gets to continue in some other games, like I will always be excited for what this team at Respawn does, because man, it's just it's great to have like third person combat that is this intricate, but also is not trying to just be Dark Souls, you know, like it's it's something it's something that meets you meets you in the middle.
Yeah, just really hit the spot for me. So a worthy number one in a year where it's very difficult to call what number one it would be. So yes, Matthew, it was a pleasure.
It was we forgot to do podcasting that first hour there got a little bit shaky. But second and third hours, I think we really sort of remembered. So that's good.
Okay, I guess like some quick honorable mentions, Matthew, to see us out. I don't have many, to be honest.
I have got a couple I wanted to shout out. Yeah.
Well, you tell us what was in your sort of pool of other stuff.
Yeah. Videoverse.
Oh, of course. Lucy's Game.
They absolutely sort of fantastic love letter to online communities, but like specifically the online gaming community of like Miiverse, Videoverse seems to riff on this. This was made by guests of the podcast, Lucy Bundle. But I just found it so rich, like the how complete that online world felt.
You can go into all the different like sub forums and read all these little like arguments. The way she kind of captures the character of all these hundreds of like anonymous users and creates this sort of fictional gaming universe that they're all obsessed with. It's so complete a thing.
It's if you were a big me versus head, it's like absolutely essential. Very, very, very almost made my list. I was just slaying between that and Let's Revolution for number 10.
But I had to give it a shout out. It's amazing.
So what Matthew was saying, Lucy, is you should have put some Minesweeper in your game and it would have made it to the top 10.
I'm sorry, Lucy. Forgive me. I also really liked Chance of Senar, which is like the weird language deciphering game, where you learn a symbol-based language of these various cultures as you climb up this puzzling tower.
It's a little bit like Heaven's Vault, but less intensive. I want to say Heaven's Vault for dummies, but it's sort of that. But that suited this dummy perfectly fine.
Loads of Game of the Year lists, that one.
Yeah, it's fun. I also wanted to shout out again Fire Emblem Engage, which mechanically I think is top-tier Fire Emblem. Incredibly satisfying creating these mad warrior builds that pull off these superhuman feats.
This very almost made my list also. I felt like if I put this on my list, but not Mario Wonder, people would kill me for some reason. I don't know why I feel that, but I did feel that so I chickened out and put it in Honorable Mentions.
That's fair. Those are your games, aren't you?
Those are my honorables.
Yeah. I suppose I guess the podcast like Jay's Game Cassette Beast, I thought was a really accomplished Pokemon alike and I didn't finish it, which is why it wasn't in contention. Yeah, but a really cool game and I'm glad that I found an audience this year.
Like I say, Starfield, if I had more time, Starfield would have been in the top 10. I just didn't have enough time between going to Japan and then going to my parents' for Christmas. I just didn't have enough time to sink into it, unfortunately.
But we'll keep pursuing that one.
I think Starfield over Zelda would have made me go full Joker. Yeah. I'm glad that didn't happen.
Yeah, I suppose I should say that Tears of Kingdom was not completely ruled out. Like I did wear it up. But similarly, if I'd have finished it, I could at least say where it belonged in my list.
I was a bit too obsessed with finishing things for this list this year. I think I really appreciate the Sea of Stars and how it revives those SNES era JRPG principles while giving a fresh cut of paint to some of the different elements. I don't think it's successful in all areas, but it certainly captured people's imaginations and I think it deserved to.
So that's a good one. Matthew, I'm really curious, actually, I will say actually Fire Emblem and Gauge, I agree with you. I thought that was a really strong kickoff point at the start of the year.
It's easy to forget January games, but that was a really nice treat when that came along. Alan Wake too, Matthew, that didn't make your list, but I see you finished it after.
I actually haven't quite finished it yet. I'm in the final stretch, it's so long.
I think there's a lot of heart in it, but I think it might all be total nonsense. It's not a no from me dog. I'm not going to say it's a no from me dog, but it's like I don't quite get it.
Right. Okay. Well, that's fair enough.
Last of all, again, another one I didn't finish, but I really like what I played of it this year, Amnesia The Bunker, which again, I wish I'd played that so I could have another horror game in my list alongside My House. But alas. So those are my horrible actions.
With the motor that goes vv.
I've played 30 minutes of Mario RPG.
Oh yeah, is it good? A Christmas game, we've got it.
It's one of those weird Switch games that looks way better in the flesh than it does in trailers.
Oh right, okay, that is odd.
That happens a lot in Switch games. When I see it on that OLED screen, I'm like, oh yeah, this is pretty handsome. And the music, the orchestrations of the old Shimamura tracks are like chef's kiss, lovely stuff.
We can give that a bit of the old plinky-plonky from Shimamura, very much like the Jules Holland of video game composers. That's the worst thing I could possibly have said. I don't know why I said that.
I take it back instantly. This podcast has been going on for too long. Matthew, we're done.
So listeners out there, if you enjoyed this episode, you'd like what we do. You want to unlock two extra podcasts a month, patient.com/backpagepod. It's reopened for pledges.
So thanks so much for all the people who didn't cancel in that month off we had there. Hopefully you understand why we needed a little break. So hopefully that's okay.
And yes, we'll be back next week with a new episode. Matthew, it's been a pleasure. Where can people get you on social media?
Mr. Basil underscore pesto on Twitter, works. Mr. Basil pesto on blue sky, no underscore.
Brilliant. Matthew is a prolific blue sky user as previously established. I'm Samuel W.
