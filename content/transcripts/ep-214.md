Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. Welcome back to podcasting. It feels like it's been a while since we've done one of these.
Is that because we had one in the bank, and maybe it's been a week since we did one? Is that right, or am I misremembering that?
Yeah, that's, yeah, we did, well, we interviewed Mike quite early, and then this interview for this episode was done last year. So, yeah, it's been, yeah, pretty quiet on the old pod front.
It has, I imagine we'll be a little bit busier throughout February, but yeah, a little bit of a hiatus never really hurts. So this, the listeners have no clue what we're referring to, because they've experienced no hiatus at all. They've had a steady stream of pods as per usual.
So yes, this episode, interesting one because it's a longer-awaited feat of the podcast to get someone from N64 Magazine on an episode to talk about making that magazine. But somehow, Matthew, it turned into a bit of a poison chalice for you, and sort of like a slight sort of nightmare logistically. So I guess we'll talk about that a little bit.
But this episode is an interview with the Tim Weaver, former journalist and editor turned successful crime novelist. So, you know, a good friend of yours and someone who people might be aware of in the UK gaming magazine, sort of like podcasting sphere as well, because Xbox World had a big podcasting presence. But yeah, so Matthew, set us up.
How did this come together and why is it only you doing the chat in this episode?
Well, we've been talking to Tim for a little while about doing it. Obviously, Tim is a very busy guy and has a lot of different schedules because he's writing novels and he puts out a yearly new book in his series. He also has lots of other creative projects and it was looking like it was kind of do it before Christmas or Tim was going to sort of vanish into deadline hell for the first half of this year.
And then there was also a second time limit in that he was about to go on holiday to South Africa with his family for Christmas for like three weeks. So I think we did this like the last night before he left. He very kindly gave me a couple of hours of his time, which was nice.
On top of that, I had to lend him a microphone because he wasn't set up to do the podcasting at home, which led to some audio troubles, which I'll explain a bit later. So yes, that was all quite hectic, but very worthwhile because Tim is absolutely like a very key figure in the UK games magazine scene. He went into it incredibly young, straight out of college basically.
He was an editor of Future by 21 or 22, then the youngest editor at the time. I'm always surprised, he's not that much older than me really. I think he's only like five years older than me, six years older than me.
But he feels like he's been there forever, and I was reading him as a teenager. So in my head, he's like 60, but he definitely isn't. But yeah, he was there for N64, NGC, kind of flitted in and out.
He's edited a lot of different magazines, and you'll get a little kind of taste of that in the episode, in our conversation. I then worked under him for a little bit towards the end, and then he went off and had this whole other career, which is where he becomes, quote unquote, kind of traditionally famous, I guess, for most people in that he's really known for his books. So there's so many different avenues of conversation with this, and we cover quite a lot of it.
Like, there's mostly a big chunk of N64 chat in here. I think we maybe do talk a little bit about being an editor and his approach, because he was an editor, like, most of all. Like, he was only a staff writer for, like, four years and then was editing mags for, like, the next, whatever, 15 years.
So it kind of skews it a little bit. But I hopefully people find it interesting, you know, like, we didn't go, like, super, super, super in depth on any one thing, but I think it paints a good picture of how things changed, why he had to get out, and what he did to get out. So hopefully people find that valuable.
Yeah, I think so. I mean, you know, I imagine we'll get, much like when we had Stu Tertin on, probably a few of Tim's fans tuning in, who may be less familiar with his games media work. So that will be illuminating, I'm sure.
I think I slipped into the trap of asking him questions about very specific things that I was interested in about his editorial mindset, which may be verging on Inside Baseball. So we'll see. Because there were questions I was curious about him that I've never talked to him about.
And I thought, well, as we're here, we may as well tick these things off about his editorial inspirations and whatnot. So I think some people might be expecting two straight hours of like the minutia of N64. And there is definitely a good chunk on that, playing GoldenEye and going to early E3 and things like that.
So, you know, hopefully people will still enjoy it.
Yeah, Inside Baseball has never really been a concern of this podcast. Like we've, you know, we've definitely gone inside, inside baseball many times now. Yeah, I think that's I think that's OK.
But yeah, that's I have no idea what the the chat tells. I've literally not listened to it myself. So when Matthew was recording this, I was busy.
It was in a window where I think we did four episode recordings back to back. And then at the end of December, we were like, let's make sure we have next December off like we did last year, because it's actually too hard to make all those pods to the same standard. So Matthew, a trooper, did all four of them.
But I only did three because I'm a coward, basically.
No, that's fine, that's fine. And it made sense. N64 Magazine was quite a crucial part of my games media upbringing.
It is the first magazine that I like properly fell in love with. I mean, maybe sort of in tandem with Games Master, I guess, which Tim had also worked on at points. And, you know, I know that a lot of our listeners, you know, grew up on N64 and NGC, and then NGamer was like the next iteration of those magazines.
So, you know, I feel like I worked in the shadow of that magazine and its staff, and I worked alongside its staff. So, you know, hopefully I can bring a bit of insight, and I didn't ask too many duff questions. I see this as maybe the beginning of a mini project to try and better document those magazines.
Tim talks a lot about, you know, the key role other people played, like Jonathan Davies, who launched it, and obviously Will Overton. And as I was talking to him, I kept thinking, oh shit, we've really got to talk to Will on this podcast at some point about SuperPlay and N64. So I would like to document the whole thing a bit better and paint that picture over several people.
It's just been quite hard pinning those people down for various reasons.
Yeah, Matthew's a rare slander has put Will out of reach for us for some time now. So I'm only joking, but...
No, they all... I have tried and one day we will get Mark Green on here, I'm sure somehow. And I'd love to get Jez on and Geraint and Kitsie.
And I've just got to find the right way in really.
Yeah, so I'm pleased to be able to start finally talking about this magazine after almost approaching five years of the podcast now. So it's nice to be able to do that. I mean, there's definitely more work for us to be done in the 90s sort of sphere of games magazines.
We've very much covered the noughties area where we worked in quite a lot of detail. But that sort of first half of the noughties we tapped into a little bit. But the 90s are still pretty untapped for us.
So it might be, maybe I should ask Matt Pearce from Future if he wants to come on and talk about PC Gamer, Matthew, that might be good. Because that was my mag of this time in parallel, that was key to my taste and why I got into games media. I suppose, just to set the scene, Matthew, what did N64 and NGC mean to you growing up?
It meant having a group of people who felt like I was completely on their wavelength, or they were completely on my wavelength. They really did feel like friends I hadn't met. The way that they wrote the magazine was very personality first and personalities forward.
And that, combined with the fact that they drilled incredibly deep into the handful of games that I really liked, more out of necessity than choice, as you'll hear in the episode. They felt like they were having the conversations around games and the relationships with games that me and my friends were having. GoldenEye comes out, and for two years this magazine is covering GoldenEye as fervently as they did in their launch issue.
And that to me just, you know, maybe I didn't feel that at the time, but in hindsight I'm like, that was quite a rare thing. And rare, that's a pun. But also, it just felt like they reflected the N64 truly as it was.
They were all really funny people. Like I was reading Issue 1 today. Some scans, I don't have any physical copies sadly.
And it just struck me how sharp and funny the writing was out of the gate. They were quite erudite and strange, quite whimsical sense of humour. There wasn't much laddishness in it.
Some weird turns of phrase. And again, not something identified at the time, but looking at it now, it's so clearly a writers' magazine. It really gave people space to stretch their legs.
But without ever being too kind of high-faluting and challenging, like maybe you would associate with edge, say. The kind of perfect content focus, the perfect tone of voice, staff members I just absolutely loved. The way that they recruited people and brought them into that family, and they just instantly became iconic figures of that magazine.
They just had a really amazing run of hires and talent. They come and go, and that's sort of something I'd forgotten. Like in my head, it's this big gang of people for the whole run of it, and actually it does change a lot, and Tim goes and comes back, and again, we cover all that.
So yeah, it was just a very special time, a magazine that made you love magazines. And I think there's a reason a lot of people I've worked with, and we've worked with have the similar relationship with it. You know, they maybe wanted to work on games mags, not just because they loved games, but because they loved the magazines themselves.
And this was definitely a magazine which had that reputation.
Yeah, it was, like you say, not highfalutin, but it definitely had a shotgun of box-outs at every sprint. Definitely a key part of it. But even as someone who didn't have an N64 at the time, I had friends who had an N64, and I went to this kid I knew, and whenever I went around his house, he had a big stack of N64 magazines just there.
Just a huge pile. It was great to dig into it and look at the back page jokes, which are really good, and also just how they managed to stretch out the... The magic trick of that magazine is stretching out the tiny catalog of N64 games into something exciting.
Coming from that age where getting screenshots for new games was just like, how many fucking screenshots can we get from the devs? Here's like 400 perfect dark screenshots as opposed to six highly curated screenshots that come out for every AAA game now, basically. It's such a different age.
Yeah, they really did make it feel culturally exciting because the N64 is... If you see it through the prism of N64 Magazine, it does seem fun and exciting. You do remember in this positive way.
If you didn't have that magazine around and you just had the quite NAF official mag of the time stapled together and then the games line up itself, it's a deeply unimpressive generation bar like 10 or so games. I think you really needed that cheerleading. It's really a great case study for why independent games mags matter, but particularly mattered at that point.
So, yeah, it's exciting to be able to do that. I did also have the first issue of NGC, Matthew, with the VHS.
Oh, nice.
The Orange VHS. I remember watching that a few times. That was good.
That might even still be in my parents' house somewhere, so who knows. But yeah, just really good at it.
Hidden in the same place as wherever they hid the Star Wars VHS.
On top of a cupboard. Not very well.
On top of a cupboard.
Yeah, not very poking out.
Where tall Samuel can see it.
My mum couldn't remember that when I mentioned it to her, by the way. When I mentioned that story, she had no memory of that at all.
Every anecdote I tell on this podcast, I inevitably get my mum or a family member telling me, that isn't really what happened. Or you didn't really remember that right.
Or, yeah, this happened to a boy in Russia and you dreamed it. Or something like that. Just, this happened to a fictional character.
This happened to Morse. You know what I mean? That kind of thing.
Okay, so Matthew, you had some production headaches for this episode. So I do thank you for your great work, as ever, in sound engineering the podcast. What happened?
I'm always annoyed when there are sound issues with interviews because it feels like I've slightly wasted an opportunity. Basically, two things happened. Tim recorded my audio from his end as well.
So there was just a whole lot of audio going on. But that actually turned out to be a bit of a godsend because I plugged in my webcam to explain something in person to Tim. And when I did that, I did the old classic.
I recorded my audio from a webcam, which is absolutely schoolboy. So what you're going to hear is Tim's voice sounds quite nice, because he's got the microphone I lent him. But I sound like purest ass.
And that's really annoying. And I apologize for that. And I also don't want to hear about it in any comments.
Because it sucks. And I was really cross about it. And I'm really cross with myself.
And if anyone's like, Oh, I couldn't listen to this because of the audio quality. Like, I fucking know it's bad. All right.
So you just got to shut the fuck up and enjoy it.
Is there nothing you can do about it with AI? I was always... Simon Parkin, when I spoke to him, was like, Oh, when it doesn't matter how low the bad the recording quality is, you just get on an iPhone or something, I can turn it into something quite professional with some kind of software.
I don't know what that is, but I wonder if we could somehow find out and improve it.
I've tried doing some stuff. You just got to trust me on this. This is what it is.
This is what you're getting. You can hear me. You can hear the questions.
It doesn't sound like how it normally sounds. I'm not doing any more with this and that's no disrespect to Tim. You can hear him.
You've come for Tim. You haven't come for me. All right.
So I know this sounded like an apology that turned into a telling off. You know, I can just see it. I can see the comment that's going to push me over the edge.
Yeah.
Just just don't. Just just let it go.
Please just in the Discord, if you're going to comment on the audio, please just use the salute emoji instead and say, I respect the work you do, Matthew Castle, salute emoji. No further context.
That's it.
We just want that.
That's all we want. And if you've just skipped to the interview, like you came into this episode and didn't want to hear us talking, you obviously haven't heard this bit. But I am going to direct you back to this bit so you can hear the choice words I have for you.
Please listen to this bit. I mean, it's pointless asking that.
No, it's not because we would have said it at the end of the podcast when they'd already listened to the interview. Therefore, they've gone back to the start to hear this, Matthew. So if you've already heard the interview, you've come back, welcome.
You've traveled back in time. Please do not comment on the audio in the episode chat or on social media.
The interview also doesn't have a truly clean ending, so you're going to hear a little bit of us right at the end of this episode as well. This is what happens when I solo an episode. It's like a fucking disaster.
I don't know if deep down you enjoy it, Samuel, because it shows that you really know what you're doing and these things don't happen on your watch.
No, I want to see you thrive. I don't derive any joy from seeing you fail, Matthew. That's only in the polls for the draft episodes.
Yeah, okay. Well, that's got... Yes.
So, you know, just be gentle with it. You're going to hear it and be like, oh, fucking yikes, but just give it. It'll be fine.
I always contemplated re-recording every line I said and I thought, I just can't do it. I can't be doing that. That's madness.
Yeah, that's fine. This is like, I can't be any worse than the worst end to an interview I ever had, which was with a writer who has been cancelled. No, not that one.
A slightly lesser cancellation than that one. But nonetheless, just said, I've got a call, so I'm hanging up now. And they just put the phone down.
But, you know, if I was a lady sending in pictures, I imagine he wouldn't have done that based on what later came out about him. Little side story there.
And now you can play the game.
Who is that?
That's like a very depressing version of The Root Trees Are Dead.
What a great note to transition to our interview with Tim Weaver, Matthew. And so, yes, we'll see you at the end of the podcast for the usual admin. So Matthew, here it is, take it away.
Welcome back to the podcast, where we are joined by our very special guest, Tim Weaver, former magazine man extraordinaire, now turned crime writer extraordinaire, who has written the David Raker thriller series. Obviously, we'll talk a little bit about that, but we've never had a Nintendo magazine lineage person on this podcast, so this is a good moment for us. Tim, hello.
Hello, Matthew Castle, thank you for having me on. We haven't seen each other for absolutely ages, and now we've seen each other twice in a week.
We have, yeah. We met up for our annual coffee, where we update each other on our exciting lives. Yours slightly more exciting than mine these days.
Yeah, always nice to catch up. I should say, we were recording this before Christmas. This episode is actually going out in February, I think.
So let's not try and baffle people with loads of Christmas references. Obviously, I caught up with you last week, so I know how you are. But for the listeners' sake, how are you doing, Tim?
I'm doing well, thank you. Yeah, just in quite a different stage of my career to what we're going to be talking about on this podcast. But no less happy for it, you know.
Things are going well. And yeah, I'm having a good time and very, very busy, which is which is good and very fortunate as well to be doing something that I really love. You know, I get to have a day job where I get to do something that I've always wanted to do and always dreamed of doing.
So yeah, I feel very lucky and never tried to, you know, take it for granted.
And have we caught you at a hellish time of the year? Because I know you write an annual series. So where does December normally fit into things for you?
December's not too bad, actually, generally. It's been a bit busier this year than previous years, maybe for reasons we'll go on to chat about later. But yeah, December's normally not too bad.
November, December's not too bad. I mean, my deadline for the books tends to be September every year. So the autumn between when I sort of submit the book, end of September-ish, through to Christmas is normally pretty okay.
So not too bad a period. A bit busier than maybe it normally is, but not too manic. So yeah, I'm going quite a good place at the moment, but looking forward to the Christmas break, which of course we'll see miles away by the time people get to listen to this.
Nice. Well, I hope it went well and you had a nice holiday. Thank you.
Yeah. I think before we get into everything, I'm curious, how do you feel talking and looking back on the magazine era? Because obviously now you get interviewed a lot for your books and you're very much in that frame of mind.
Is it easy to dredge up this stuff?
Yeah, it is. Definitely. It was a big part of my life, a really big part of my life.
So it's very easy to talk about it. I mean, my memories of that period are not as good as they might have been because it was a long time ago, right? You know, like it's getting on for 30 years ago now.
You know, so it was a long... When I started the future, yeah, it was almost 30 years ago, you know. So it feels a long time ago because it was a long time ago.
But I still do recall quite vividly a lot of that period. Not every single detail. Sometimes I get messages even now from people who are, you know, who are massive fans of N64 Magazine and that sort of period of magazines.
And they'll get in touch and they'll say, oh, I'm trying to complete my collection or I'm trying to find out this piece of information. Can you help me? And I'm like, no, I can't because it happened 25 years ago and I can't remember.
You know, but there is a lot that I remember about that period. And I really enjoy remembering it because it was a big part of my life. And actually, I think if I hadn't have done that, been through that stage in my career, if I hadn't have done N64 Magazine and a lot of the other magazines I did, I'm not sure I would have gone on to be a writer because journalism teaches you a lot of really, really useful skills, you know, which are very applicable when you go on to do a career like I've got.
We will put these memories to the test. So, I want to rewind all the way back before you were working on Games Magazine. I'm just kind of interested to sort of dig into some of your earlier gaming memories.
You know, you're obviously synonymous with N64 Magazine, NGC Magazine, Xbox World 360. I imagine a lot of people will know you from that later and other magazines in between. But, you know, I'd say Nintendo is probably for our listeners is their sort of, you know, what they most associate you with.
But I understand that you weren't necessarily like the biggest sort of Nintendo guy growing up, like before you worked on the mags, is that right?
Yeah, I mean, that would probably be fair. You know, like I grew up, I mean, I did love games, you know, but I grew up with an Eager basically. I didn't really have the consoles.
My friends had Nintendo consoles or the Mega Drives, and I would play them, but I wouldn't consider myself to have been an expert, you know. I was much more, I loved my Amiga. I played my Amiga for hours and hours and hours.
I had an Amiga too. Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, that was a great machine, right? It adds a brilliant, you know, brilliant games.
Were you into the point and click games ever?
It depends what you mean. Like, I mean, I-
Like a bit of Indiana Jones, Fate and the Lances, Monkey Island.
Very definitely. The Indiana Jones, the Fate and the Lances and the million disc changes on it. That was, I mean, I loved that game.
Yeah. Big, big into stuff. I loved it.
And obviously, sensible soccer as a big football fan.
Yeah. I played a little bit of that with the spinning guy. They used to sort of spin.
Yeah.
It was great, great, great game. And they had some brilliant games on there. Really, really good.
So, you know, I grew up playing that and, you know, like my sort of first contact, if you like, with future publishing was through magazines like Amiga Format and Amiga Power. And in other companies, there was an Amiga magazine. I think they did an EMAP called The One, which was really good.
I loved that mag. So, yeah, so that was kind of my first contact. So I wouldn't say that I didn't, I definitely was a gamer, but I just wasn't really a Nintendo gamer necessarily.
And, you know, N64 came about after I'd, well, we may get on the talk about this, but obviously, you know, my first gig at Future was working on Total, a Nintendo magazine. And that came about really because by chance, really, and luck, actually, basically my original plan was to go to university, was go to film school, basically.
Right, right, yeah.
And I had a place up in London at film school, really good course, it was like 80% practical. So it wasn't a film theory course, it was an actual, actually learning how to be a filmmaker, you know, because I had very realistic dreams for an 18-year-old about being a writer-director. So yeah, I had a place at film school and wanted to do that.
And then I spectacularly copped up my A-levels. And then I was like, well, what am I going to do now? Because I didn't get the grades to get into film school.
And I wasn't really sure what else I wanted to do. I mean, I'd always loved writing, but I didn't really know what I could, you know, whether I didn't really think of about it in terms of it being a career. So my mom actually saw a job in the paper at Future Publishing, which was on.net magazine.
And so I applied for it. I got an interview and I went in for the interview and it was with Richard Longhurst. And he interviewed me and was really kind about the fact that I didn't really have any experience and stuff.
And I thought it was just a good experience. You know, I didn't get the job, but he said I did. I must have done a right job because he recommended me to Rob Pegley, who was the editor at the time on Total Nintendo.
Yeah, Pegley got me in for an interview and I was lucky again, because the interview was the biggest joke in the world, basically. It was an hour long and Rob and I basically talked about football for 45 minutes. So it was amazing, because I had very little interview experience.
So not only did I have no experience of being a writer, really, let alone a published writer, I had no interview experience at all, because I had a Saturday job, but that's not the same as, you know. So I was very, very lucky, very, very lucky. And I got offered the job, I think, maybe because Rob was just desperate for someone to come in.
When you read interviews with people who are at Future in those earlier years, a lot of people seem to get there in of like, I went for this and then this person put me in contact with this person. Like it felt a little bit more, I don't know, like raw, I guess, or like less kind of corporate and sort of...
Definitely, definitely. I was thinking about this earlier, actually, just in sort of prep for this. I was thinking about how different Future was back then.
And actually it was into the sort of early 2000s, up until the mid 2000s, I would say up to about 2005, 2006. It was in the very best sense of the word, like the Wild West. You went in, you got promoted fast, they launched magazines all the time.
If you had some crazy ass idea for a magazine or a project or something, they were willing to back it and give it a go. It was quite disorganized, which I think was actually in a weird way benefited the company because it created this amazing energy and also this insane petri dish for ideas. So people were coming up with ideas for stuff all the time.
Magazines were launching the whole time and people were moving around the whole time. Also within the context of individual magazines, you were really getting some absolutely fantastic ideas and the kinds of things that you wouldn't get now because everything is so formulaic. Everything is just, like you said, corporate and it wasn't like that.
It was really, when I started out there, it was very much like we were right on the, I don't want to say that it sounded like corny, but it was like, I honestly felt like you were right on the cutting edge of doing really cool stuff the whole time. You know, it was really exciting. And I think we were helped a little bit by the fact that back then, video games, in terms of, you know, the video games publishers and the companies and stuff, they weren't as corporate either.
So, you know, you could, you had a lot more freedom to kind of cover games in the way you wanted to cover them. As an example, having someone in Japan where the games came out first, reviewing games for you out there, you know, you had no global embargoes and, you know, like, you didn't have to sign NDAs and all this kind of stuff. So, it just created this amazing laboratory really for ideas and, you know, this, this, and that's why I think there are so many magazines from that period that are so fondly remembered, is because they were created in an environment that really encouraged kind of creativity and innovation.
Everyone is so sort of, yeah, attached to that era and so many, like, names come out of that era as well.
Yeah, I mean, there are, there are so many talented journalists, and I'm not saying there aren't talented journalists now, but I just think that talent is harder to see rise to the surface because everyone's sort of, you know, future now, I don't know anything about future now, but it seems to me much more corporate and more like a machine now, you know, like churning out hashtag content.
Yeah, so much of it became around, like, efficiency and just, like, making a magazine with increasingly small teams that the time for play and experimentation just vanished. I mean, it was pretty corporate when I joined NGamer in 2006, but it was still like, I feel like there are enough people from that early era still kind of encouraging it. You know, you were still there, like, obviously I worked under Mark Green, and he was, like, very much kind of cut from that kind of cloth.
Yeah, yeah.
I must admit, I didn't ever read Total back in the day. Apologies for that.
I mean, the latter day Total was not a great man.
Oh, OK.
You know, like, I think it's OK to say that. The one that Steve Jarrett and Andy Dyer launched was really good, you know, but the one that we had at the end in the dying days of Total was pretty ass, to be honest. I mean, at the time, I thought it was great, you know, because I had no experience.
But as I got more experienced, I sort of looked back and think, that wasn't a great mag, really. You know, like, it wasn't, I mean, it was dying on its ass, for one thing. So, like, no one was reading it, which kind of is a kind of depressing place to be, you know, when you're creating magazines, knowing that you're sending it basically out there to die.
So, and it had a minuscule team, you know. So, it was basically me, Rob Pegley. We had a prod head and we had an art editor, you know.
Yeah, really talented art editor called Christian Day, who I went on to work with, again, brilliant designer. But there's only so much, you know, you can do. And I don't think Rob's heart was in it, necessarily, you know, because he went on to become a publisher and stuff.
And I just think that it wasn't something that he wanted to do. So, I just think the magazine felt what it was, which was the future's least important Nintendo mag. And, you know, like, just not...
It just generally wasn't a great mag, I don't think.
I'm already thinking you worked or had some crossover with Danny Wallace.
Yes, Danny Wallace had my job before. Well, I got Danny Wallace's job, basically, when he went hunting. So, yeah, not a difficult job, not a difficult person to follow at all.
You know, I think that was another thing as well, you know, like, he was such a brilliant writer and has obviously gone on to have an amazing career, you know, but so talented and such a unique voice. And I think it was, you know, for a first gig, I think it was pretty hard to follow him, you know, because he had a very unique style and it was, it was just, yeah, so for all sorts of reasons, it was hard, but also like a really good proving ground, you know, I learned a lot on that, Mike, you know, a lot about writing, a lot about magazines in general, things that were good to do and things that were less good to do.
After that, I know that you did a stint on Super Play and I'm kind of curious about those years, you know, obviously, beloved magazine, like a real cult Nintendo magazine. Just kind of curious what that move was like, because getting dropped into another mag like that, you know, it's not always easy and there's like different cultures and, you know, we've never talked to anyone from Super Play on the part, so I'm just curious what it was like on the inside.
I was only there for a few months and that was basically after Total closed. They had to find a place for me to go and so they put me on Super Play and, you know, I went on to work with Will, obviously for a long time on N64.
That's Will Overton.
Will Overton, sorry, yeah. Will Overton. And so I got to know him really, really well.
But that was the first time I had met him. And I definitely got the sense when I moved to Super Play that I wasn't necessarily wanted. And I understand that because they didn't hire me.
And, you know, I've worked on Total Nintendo, which was not in the same sort of class as Super Play and not even in the same kind of sub genre of Nintendo magazines as Super Play was, you know, like my knowledge of Japanese gaming, for example, was not that great. You know, so like, I was forced upon them. And I understand that, you know, that was not maybe not something I'm not talking about Will specifically.
I'm just talking generally, you know. But it was interesting again, you know, like you learn a lot from it, you know, like I beefed up my knowledge of Nintendo gaming again. And because obviously on Super Play, they went into it in crazy depth in a way that Total didn't.
Total was like the sort of Aldi of Nintendo mags and Super Play was like the Waitrose of Nintendo mags, you know. Or Harrods maybe would be more appropriate.
It's obviously like Super Play had a very different energy to any other mag, but there is something like it had shared quite a lot of people who went on to be on like Edge and things like that.
Yeah.
It had that kind of like quite hardcore credentials.
Yeah, it did. And it had a very hardcore audience. And when you were working with someone like Will, Will was so crazy knowledgeable.
It was actually quite intimidating in a lot of ways, because he was just so smart and knew so much about Nintendo gaming. And was obviously so lauded for not just his level of knowledge, but his incredible gift, which was his illustrative work and all that kind of stuff. So I got to know him really well, but he was part of a crew that were just really, really hardcore and knew their stuff.
And it was just night and day compared to total. So it was like a big education for me. Again, I learned a lot from it though.
It was really interesting. And it was up to me really to prove to them that, okay, my level of knowledge might not be what it is with you guys, but I can write. So we've got some tools to work with here.
But actually I wasn't on there very long. I can't even remember how long. Maybe like, I feel like it might have only been three, four, five months, something like that.
Not very long at all. But I really enjoyed it. And it was, again, it brought me into a different world and I got to meet Will.
And obviously then I went on to work with him afterwards. And yeah, it was good.
I know that there was some other things after that. I know that you did a bit on Games Master. But to sort of jump to N64 Magazine, I guess that was staffed up with a lot of SuperPlay people.
I'm interested if it was, did that play a part in like, why you were part of that from the start? Like, where does N64 come from basically for you?
I'm trying to remember, but I don't think, I had to interview for the role. So, I wasn't given the job just because I worked on SuperPlay. And like you said, I was on Games Master.
I worked under Marcus Hawkins on Games Master. And Marcus was a brilliant editor. Like, just a really good like, people manager.
Like, he felt like you were really important in his team, but also really like, editorially really smart. I learnt a lot from Marcus actually.
I was actually going to ask, not to cut you off or to jump too far into it. Like, I was interested if there was a particular editor who you think had the most influence on your own editorial style. Because, you know, I would say for my generation of writers, you are quite an influential person for a lot of people who worked under you or adjacent to you.
Like, just in how you kind of carried yourself and and like your editorial values, I feel like there's a lot of you in me, Pellet, Michael Gapper, for example. I mean, it's a bit of a weird question and maybe requires like some heavy self-analysis. But like, where does the Weaver editorial persona kind of come from?
I would say it's a mix of things. I would say that Marcus, I found very inspirational. You know, he was probably, by then I'd had one, two, three editors by the time I joined Games Master.
And none of them were any Apache on Marcus. He made you immediately feel like you were an important voice on the team. He gave you like really good stuff to do, let you get on with it, didn't micromanage you.
But editorially, he was smart, like he had really good ideas. The magazines he worked on always looked really good. So he was the first guy, I think, that I really admired and learned a lot from.
Jonathan Davis was obviously the editor on N64. He was a brilliant ideas man, like so, so smart when it came to ideas. Like just some of the stuff he came up with was just so, so good.
Like really in tune with his audience, you know, knew his audience completely. Not the best man manager at that point, I don't think, you know, like, and that's, you know, not trying to criticise him, but I think he just had a lot on his plate. And I think that sometimes when I was first joined the MAG, I felt a little bit alienated on it, you know, like I wasn't really part of the team, you know, like you just like some words monkey that got given, like the jobs to go and do, you didn't feel like necessarily your voice was heard.
He did become better as he went on. I guess maybe like there was a level of trust involved, like where he had to make sure that, and you see that throughout life sometimes, you know, you meet people who need to be able to see that you're not a total clown before they start trusting you with, you know, like what their baby and stuff. So, but, and certainly in terms of like the actual magazine craft side of things, Jonathan was a huge, huge influence, really, really smart guy.
Some of the ideas that he built into N64 Magazine, you know, like the huge reviews and that kind of thing, really was, that was all him, you know, that was all driven by him, you know, like, so, learned a lot from him, a lot. And then I had James Ashton on N64, he was good, you know, like, and learned a lot from him as well. I would say probably a mixture of, predominantly a mixture of Marcus, I learned a lot from Marcus, about, especially about managing people and looking after people and giving them ownership of the mags, but in terms of like editorial, Jonathan was a big influence as well.
Who would you say was the big propagator of cartoonish mag personas? I know that that was quite common in a lot of magazines, but that sense of here is a person and I'm going to boil them down to this core essence, because that's something I associate with N64 and NGC, but I really associate with you on like Meet the Team pages and things like that. That idea of I've got this person's number, this is what they're going to be about for the next four years.
Yeah, I mean, that was a bit-
Is that just your humour or was that-
Yeah, I think it's a combination of things. I mean, like Marcus did it a lot on GM, and we did it a bit on N64 in the early days, but it wasn't quite as a server because it got later on down the line, where it was like, Kitsey's a serial killer and that kind of thing. I mean, that was really, I suppose, driven by me, those kinds of personalities and stuff.
I felt like it was in, again, like you learn a lot as you go through and I learned a lot as a writer and then I learned a lot as a features editor, I think I was, and then a deputy editor. And then when you're an editor, you think, right, I'm going to apply all these things. And obviously we were doing Meet the Team Pages way before I became editor of N64, but I would say that definitely it became a big part of what I felt was an important part of my ownership of the mag, was trying to make each individual person feel in the reader's mind.
It's like creating a character, right, in a story. You know, like you need the reader to be able to immediately know who this person is. And even if the only thing they know about them is that he's a serial killer, or he's got a massive bald head, or she's got a massive big beating stick, to get you kind of doing your words on time.
They remember it, you know, and it builds a sense of community as well. You know, like, you know it's working when you're getting readers writing your letters as it was back then, you know, referencing that kind of stuff. And also readers feeling like they know who you are, you know, and I think that's an important part of it.
You know, you needed to make people feel part of a club.
Yeah, it's funny, like, now I have the occasional Twitter interaction with someone who was clearly an Xbox World 360 reader, and what they know of me is that I'm stupidly tall. I went to Oxford and I looked a bit like Gabe Neal in a combination of those things.
I think, didn't we used to say that you had a generic face?
Yeah, I had a generic face, yes.
You looked like a lot of different people.
What always made me laugh was your efficiency in Xbox World to combine those things in just like 20 words on Meet and Team. It won't be like, I went to Oxford, you know, he said, as he turned around, crushing an orphanage under his giant foot, and you'd be like, very good.
They were good, I mean, and there's part and parcel of it, you know, like it was, you know, Jonathan, when he launched the mag, brought in this very clubby kind of feel, which was, you know, like Pete Reader's becoming involved in N64 Magazine in a huge, huge way. And it's all, it's, you know, the credit goes entirely to him. It's a, it was an amazing achievement, you know, like generating that level of following, you know, and people were absolutely bought into that magazine and the, the kind of world that we constructed.
And you know, the team pages and the big reviews and time trials and all, you know, Mario Kart time trials and all that sort of stuff. People send, readers sending in videos to prove themselves and all that sort of stuff. You don't get that if you haven't successfully, you know, generated this sense of a community.
Yeah, no, absolutely. I remember me and my mates sending in all kinds of stuff. There was a competition in N64.
I'm pretty sure it was N64, where you just had to send in something good that you had. It was just like send us anything.
I remember that, yeah.
And like, I think I sent in just like something I got from like a Christmas cracker. I think one of my friends sent in something Garfield related and his got in. I was so jealous.
I was just like, oh man, you've like impressed the people at N64 Magazine.
You've made it. I just remember like, we did a feature once when I was editor where we, we recreated games in real life. I don't know if you remember this.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. And we did like Banjo Kazooie and I got on James' back and he had to wear a beak, I think. And then Jez Bickham did Extreme G and he put all the elastic bands in his pants.
To pull his face back and stuff. I mean, that sort of stuff, I suppose in a way quite self-indulgent because we were just using ourselves to kind of promote. We were front and center of a feature basically, but it worked within the context of that mag because people really knew who we were or knew our magazine personalities anyway.
And I think it's just great. You know, like it was just great fun. It was such good fun.
We had such a laugh on that magazine. Like it was really, really good.
It was actually quite a shock when I joined in 2006. Slightly different vibe. But like I was working with people who I felt like I knew them a little bit, but I didn't.
And it was, I wouldn't say it was ever like a wake up call, but there were some people you were like, they are 100% their persona. And there were some people who were like very different. And I just had to instantly adjust to that, which was...
I mean, again, you know, that proves that it worked because you come in, you know, you come into an environment where you think you know these people because you know them through the magazine, you know. And that was a big part of N64's, well, one of the big spokes on the wheel was that kind of sense of community. So, yeah, it was great.
It was great. And I was lucky as well on that mag, when I became editor, I was lucky because I just had such talented people working for me. It was crazy.
The level of talent on that mag was ridiculous, you know, like so it's just obviously the people working for me made me look great, you know, because they were just they were just producing such amazing stuff. And I didn't have to. Obviously, you know, I would manage them, but you don't have to.
You almost don't have to do that because you're so creative, you know, and so talented, you know, people like Jazz and Kitsy and Will and, you know, after that, Greener and she's so talented, you know, like really ridiculously talented and very, very lucky to have them on the magazine, you know.
I'm interested in that you're at this quite big sort of transition points for games. You know, you're covering like the shift from the 2D generations into the 3D generations, you know, covering the N64 itself. Was there a big buzz around that at the time?
You know, like, what was, like, did it feel like, oh, we're at the forefront of something, you know, or does that stuff kind of, does it all sort of blur together a bit?
Yeah, I mean, in what? It was definitely like that. I mean, you know, when you saw Mario 64, I mean, it just felt like such a huge accomplishment.
You couldn't help but feel like you were at the forefront of the next generation, you know, like it felt incredible. I think the issue that we had really on N64 specifically was that we just never had enough games. You know, like when we got the Nintendo made games, like that's why we spat, in a weird way, it worked out quite well because it meant you could...
Yeah, because you got these Nintendo games in and you basically, because of the lack of releases, you could spend issue after issue after issue talking about it. Like GoldenEye, we must have milked for about 20 issues. You know, like, and that's probably not even an exaggeration.
There was nothing else to talk about because Nintendo weren't bringing out any games and third parties were really, really reluctant to develop for it, you know. So whenever we got a Nintendo game in, a first party game in, you know, you, you were amazed by it. I mean, they were all pretty much all incredible.
And, you know, whenever they came in, you thought, ah, right, now I understand what the N64 is kind of capable of. And I understand that we are at the inception of something incredibly exciting. But the problem is we just didn't have enough of them, you know.
And so, and the third-party games came in. And in retrospect, I sort of understand why so many of them were shat. It's because it was just so difficult to develop for.
That was the other thing. The machine was so hard to develop for. And a lot of these third-party games came in, and they were either really terrible or they were just bang average.
You rarely got a third-party game that was really exceptional. And so, you know, we looked across the kind of building, and PlayStation magazines would just add so many games, they couldn't even cope with it.
But was there ever a sense of jealousy there? Because this is more the days of console wars, and people were very like, I have a Nintendo, the N64 is where it's at. I mean, I don't know if it felt like that on the team.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, it did, I mean, the console wars thing was huge, obviously. We had to, like, in the mag, pretend that we weren't at all jealous about the fact that, you know, PlayStation had a billion games. You know, like, these mags were reviewing, like, 25 games an issue, and we were lucky.
And sometimes, genuinely, we had one game to review. You know, so it was hard, you know, but I think that we sort of span it like, yeah, but 90% of their games are shat. So why would you, you know, we've got GoldenEye, or we've got Mario, or we've got Mario Kart, or we've got F-Zero, or whatever it is, you know, like, Wave Race, Pilot Wings, you know, everything, you know, like, we've got all these brilliant games that we spend hours talking about.
And the reason we spend hours talking about it is because they're just so ace, which was part and parcel of it, obviously, because they were really good. But it was mostly because we had nothing else to talk about. And that was where we were fortunate on N64, is because we could actually go to Japan and the US and do import reviews, you know, whereas the official mag up in London didn't have that opportunity, you know, so that was what also gave us a little bit of advantage, was that on lean months, of which there were many, we could go into Japan and, you know, review a few, sometimes on N64 games, or sometimes you could review bigger games that weren't coming out in the UK for a while, because these were in the days as well, when games came out in Japan first, US second and the UK got it at some point way down the line.
You know, so yeah, we did feel like we were on the cusp of something exciting, but I do think it was harder to kind of be continually excited about what the console was achieving, because people were finding it so difficult to develop for, and so many of the things we were getting in were just terrible. You know, like genuinely terrible games. And I think in retrospect, that was just because the console, the architecture, the hardware was just so, so hard.
You know, Nintendo made it really, really hard to develop for, and the consequence was that the third party support was pretty abysmal throughout the entire duration of N64 NGC's existence.
As a reader of it, I like to imagine that you guys, for half the issue, were just sitting there playing like GoldenEye Deathmatch. Any truth in that? Was there a lot of multiplayer action in the office?
Yeah, yeah. We used to play it. We used to play Mario Kart and GoldenEye constantly.
It was the best.
It was amazing, you know. When F-Zero came in, we played a bit of that as well. But I remember Will Overton being way too good at that.
So that got, like, shoved off the agenda, and it became back about a GoldenEye and Mario Kart. We did... I remember when James, as editor on N64, we had ISS Superstar Soccer in, and I remember I was quite good at that.
And I remember, like, consistently beating him on it. And he got so angry one day that he kicked the... We had, like, a desk that had...
It was like a... It was like a... It was like just a standard, like, office desk, and it had drawers underneath it on one side.
And he kicked this desk so hard that the whole thing collapsed. So angry about it. He used to accuse me of doing what he called a milk round, which was like when the...
I got a player and I just, like, went or wove my way around his entire team before I stick it in the back of the map. So when we all started doing the equivalent of that on F-Zero and absolutely smashing us all, we were like, no, we're not having this. We're going back to GoldenEye Mario Kart.
But I would say, my vivid memories are like, GoldenEye was like, you're not allowed to have our job.
He's a cheat.
He's a cheat character. And of Mario Kart, it was... I can't remember what the...
Was it DK Parkway, where it's got that... If you get shrunk on the last bit, you fall down the...
Oh, I know what you're talking about.
I can't remember what the name of the track is. I think it is DK Parkway or something like that. And you come up to the last straight, and there's a jump over a bit of the track that's below you.
And everyone, whichever asshole had the shrink thing for the last lap, they'd wait until the very last minute and shrink everyone... or shrink everyone so that you fell down the hole and had to go back around the... Those are the two things I remember happening most often, you know.
And then obviously relentless kind of shouts of, have a banana when it kind of came out the back and all that sort of thing.
Oh, right.
Yeah. It was great fun. It was great fun.
I was never the best at any of the games, really.
Yeah.
But I could hold my own on those two.
Yeah. Because there was still a little bit of like a... I don't know if it was a FIFA or PES culture when I joined at lunchtime.
What were you guys playing on Xbox World?
Yeah. We used to play FIFA because, you know, like it was... I mean, karma got its revenge when I was on Xbox World because I had a writer on there called Matthew Pellett, who was just so fricking good at FIFA.
And in the end, I refused to play him because I got so angry one day, I almost smashed a controller. So, yeah, but it was definitely a PES FIFA culture. I mean, we had PES mostly on N64, well, the precursor to it, because the FIFA on N64 was absolutely terrible.
Just terrible. I think I gave it like 30 something percent. It was so bad.
But again, that was one of the good things about the mags back then, is there was no comeback from that in a weird way. The publishers didn't get on the phone to you or get on the phone to your manager and like, we this is unacceptable, blah, blah. I mean, there was lots of that in the later years.
Publishers calling up, ranting about reviews to either you or the people above you or whatever. And you know, because the people above me in future, various points had no backbone, you know, like you got called into meeting rooms and bollocked for like, reviewing a game fairly because, you know, because they had some, I don't know, advertising deal with EA or whatever it was. And that was when, that was the years when I fell out of love with Futures because it became so corporate like that.
But back when we were doing N64, you could honestly review a game and you know, you'd review it with the, in honesty, you know, and it was terrible and you would say it was terrible and that was it. You know, like, and then, you know, the good thing was that when you reviewed a game and you gave it a really, really top notch score, then you know that it was totally a must buy, you know, like it was just a great environment, a great amount of freedom. And I think out of that freedom comes, you know, like a really, you know, it was a great, a great breeding ground for kind of creativity.
Yeah, it's interesting that you're talking about like, you know, the struggles of the third party and N64, because while that's kind of depressing for the platform, like it arguably gave N64 Magazine, like another one of its strengths, which were like the incredible kickings. And, you know, they felt like big showcases for like funny writers of just like, you know, how creatively can I drop this thing, which gets 10%? I mean, I think you gave out some of the lowest score.
I think behind the Carmageddon, Superman 64 reviews.
Yeah, I remember Superman 64, yeah. Sold My Maze. Yeah, I mean, that was when we did NGC.
I did, we did like a, when we relaunched it, we did like a compendium page at the back and we had Lex Luthor's Sold My Maze on that. You know, it was just such a fun, I mean, but that was, you know, like looking back, you know, like with the benefit of hindsight, I remember when Superman came in and Carmageddon, like these games were genuinely like abysmal. Yes.
Just absolutely terrible. Like basically completely unfinished. Or felt like that.
You know, especially, I remember Carmageddon, like we got stuck in the scenery and like half the NPCs just were wandering around, like just banging up against brick walls and all sorts of other stuff. I don't know. I guess it was just, you know, just like down to, like I say, just how difficult it was for the machine was to develop for and how little support Nintendo gave third parties, you know, which I think they learned a harsh lesson from, you know, as they went through.
But it was great for us to review these games that were absolutely terrible, you know, like these just dreadful games, you know, and like you could really, you could really have fun with them. You know, I remember that Carmageddon review. I remember, definitely remember Superman, because it was Solve My Maze and he just flew through rings that were one after another.
There wasn't a maze. It was just like a straight line of rings. A really hard maze, that one.
But it was it was great, really good. Like you could be really, really creative with it. And you had a lot of fun with it.
And like the kickings became part and parcel of the magazine as well. And, you know, like the lack of games in the same way that the lack of games allowed us to do 12 page reviews of things and, you know, continuing on doing like 12 pages of tips and then 12 pages of this and then 10 pages of how to do this and get, you know, it was just an amazing time. The best games allowed us to do that.
And the worst games allowed us to do the other thing, which was just have fun with it and just completely eviscerate these terrible games. And now I'm in a position where, you know, like my creative work is judged by the public. I think to myself, what an asshole I was, you know.
But it's, but back then it just seemed like good fun, you know?
Yeah. Oh, well, you know, the innocence of youth and all that. Actually on that, on the huge reviews, you know, something I really associate with N64 Magazine is like how bespoke it all felt.
Just layouts, completely different issue to issue. It must have been a bit of a night, like as fun as it was, it must have been a bit of a nightmare from a like technical craft perspective, right?
It was a total and utter nightmare. One of the reasons I think Jonathan struggled so much in those first few months, like with handling everything was because in magazines generally, what would happen is that you would have layouts that were, you know, you kind of fit to grids. So they were like grids that you could design pages onto and there would be like four or five different types of grids, you know, and so you'd have four or five different types of reviews, but they would all work to the same grid system and all the box sites on it and the text and stuff would fit into the grid.
They might look different, but they were all part of the same grid. When N64 launched, there were no grids at all. So that is why it looked so bespoke.
It's because every page was designed from scratch. So that is why the magazine continually went late. You know, like it was continually late on sale.
It's because it was just an absolute nightmare. And the first thing, I can't remember whether James did it or whether I did it. I think James must have done it.
But certainly the first thing I said when I got onto the mag was, we've got to get some grids. Because I'm not, I'm not. You can make the magazine feel bespoke still.
But you know, like you need to, like this is an insane way of working. You know, like it's no wonder that. And it's stressful as well because like you were doing so many late nights because we were designing pages from scratch.
And you know, when you've got someone hands in a 12 page review on a game that has only come in in the last week, only one thing is going to happen. The magazine is going to go late, you know, and you're going to miss your deadline. And you're going to miss your on sale.
And that has all sorts of other consequences, you know. So the reason it looks overspoken is because it kind of was, you know, and I think that's what helped build its reputation. But at the same time, I felt when I came in, like we can still do all this stuff.
We can still have the 12-page reviews and we can still, you know, cover games in the way we want to cover them. But I mean, we need to have a little bit more organization here because I can't, I'm not working like a month worth of late nights, you know, it just breaks you. And it has it has an effect on everything, you know, the level of creativity and the morale of the team and everything.
So, yeah, that was the reason it spoke because it was, you know, it was just, I mean, you've never launched a magazine like that now. But I think the other thing that shows is that it was a little bit like The Wild West, you know, when we launched that magazine, we had no like oversight. I mean, we had a publisher, but he was very, very hands off.
And so, you know, like in the latter days, in the future, you had like senior people all over you, like the whole time, you know, like you couldn't fart without someone coming out and saying, oh, you know, what are you doing? You know, it's just like, well, I'm just designing a magazine, you know, but the same way I have been every month. It wasn't like that when we launched N64.
It was, it was, and even when we relaunched NGC at that point, you know, we had a publisher and I'd go in sometimes and show her pages and stuff, but she was very hands off. She trusted, you know, trusted me, trusted the team to kind of get it right. And I think, you know, we did get it right.
And I think that that was another reason I fell out of love with Future is because I just got crushed in middle management hell. You know, you had been micromanaged the whole time, even though you'd been editing magazines for donkey's ears, you know. Again, you know, I keep saying it, but it really was.
It was just such an amazing environment. It was like a laboratory of ideas that you could just do. And some of it, you learn the hard way, like no grids.
But, you know, those lessons are important lessons to learn.
I believe the first issue of N64 you edited was in April 1999, had Duke Nukem Zero Hour on the cover, a classic. Maybe not back then, but maybe like looking at it in hindsight, your ascent through the ranks seemed really fast and you seemed very young. And, you know, I think that was like noticeable even as a reader, certainly when I was at Future, like my progress was so fucking slow.
And I look back on that and go, that was crazy. Like it felt like you went to editor in like three, four years from joining.
Yeah. I mean, if that's in 99, so I joined Future in November 95. So yeah, so it was four years.
Yeah. You know, was that something you were actively pursuing or like how does that kind of happen? Or was it just the culture back then?
I think it was just the culture back then. I mean, I think I'm right in saying that I was the youngest editor ever at Future at the time.
Wow.
And I think they had concerns about that. Like, I think, yeah, you know, in all seriousness, I think they did, you know, when James left, I think he went to become a publisher, I think.
He was a publisher.
Yeah. And I remember asking him about it. And he said, I think they've got concerns about the fact you're only 22, you know, and I think it's, and that's fair enough.
Like, it's a massive responsibility to give to someone who's just still in their early 20s, you know. But by then, I've done four years in Mags. And especially on N64, you know, I've done whatever issue.
What do you say it was? What issue was it?
It was, I didn't have the actual issue. I think it was, it was April 1999.
I mean, it must have been like late 20s, maybe, I don't know, early 30s, something like that. So I've done a lot of issues of it. So I knew my way around the Mag and I'd seen, learnt a lot from Jonathan, learnt a lot from James, you know, what to do, what I felt maybe I wouldn't do.
Yeah, I felt like I was ready for it, you know, and I didn't feel like young, you know, even though I guess I really was young, really young. But I understand in retrospect that, you know, they probably did have some concerns about it. I remember I did an interview and I guess I must have said the right things because they gave me the job, you know, and it sort of hit the ground running really.
And I think, you know, like two or three issues in, and I'd sort of done enough already to suggest that I knew what I was doing, you know. I think probably where the sort of youth sort of came through was maybe in the management side of things, you know, like managing people can be quite hard. And I think that although everyone on the team was lovely, like there are definitely things that I probably could have done differently in terms of managing people.
But as a massive learning curve, you know, creatively I felt like I didn't really feel stressed or worried about it at all. And so it did happen fast, but I felt like I was pretty ready for the challenge. And that was just kind of how future was, you know, like it was still like that back then, you know, like you move, like we talked about earlier, you know, you move around a lot, people move up fast, you know, things are launching all the time.
So people are moving off and, you know, we're hiring people and that kind of stuff. And it was just part and parcel of how future was back then. It was just a really inspiring place to work because you knew that you, you know, you, if you worked hard and you showed what you were capable of, there was a real path to development, you know, like you could move up really fast.
And like, you know, when you joined, it was different already, you know, like it was just really, really hard to do that. And, you know, in the latter days of future, it was pretty much impossible to do that, really. There were no opportunities at all, really.
So it was just a different environment back then, you know. Obviously, pre-internet as well, which is helpful, because, you know, like it was the only place that people could get the information that they wanted about video games, you know. So you weren't competing against the internet who could beat you every single time, you know, like readers had to wait for month to month.
And I think one of the things that also worked in N64's favour was that because we didn't have that volume of games, we never felt out of date, you know. So like the magazine would come out and every month, you know, it didn't matter that we were covering Goldeneye again, you know. And the games that we did cover, we were pretty fast with, but because there were so few games, it was, we were featuring the same games over and over.
So it never felt like we were playing catch up. Whereas I think some of the other mags, you know, like the PlayStation mags, have such a volume of content, that it meant that you, even then, you felt like, you know, you were behind the curves at some point in time, you know. So, so, and it certainly became that way after the internet came along, you know, because you were constantly playing catch up the whole time.
One of the things that really interests me is, you know, in that pre-internet era, you obviously got to go to old E3, a time where magazines were your only glimpse at E3, and outside of it, you know, now the whole thing is live streamed for like 48 hours, and there's like no mystery behind it. Can you talk a little bit about old E3 and what that was like?
Yeah, I mean, I'm so old that the E3 I went to was in Atlanta.
Right.
It wasn't even in LA, you know, so it was, I remember we went there and it was me, was I editor on N64 then? No, I wasn't, no, I think James was maybe still editor, or maybe even Jonathan, but anyway, I went to Atlanta and with a couple of the other guys and from Future, and so a few publishers went out as well. So I guess there were probably about six of us or eight of us, you know, four journalists and maybe four publishers.
And anyway, obviously the journalists went, we went out maybe a day earlier or whatever. And we got to Atlanta and we got the taxi to the hotel. What a dump.
I mean, this place was proper future special. They'd gone for the cheapest piece of crap hotel you could possibly imagine. It was in Midtown, which back then, I didn't know anything about, but one of the guys I went with, he smoked.
And so he went downstairs to the reception and said to them, where can I get some cigarettes? And he said, oh, there's a place a block down you can go to. And he was like, okay, great.
I'll just walk there. And he went, no, no, don't walk there. Get a cab.
All right. Walk for one block. He's like, yeah, trust me, get a cab.
And then on the second night, we heard a gunshot outside the hotel. And then the next day, there was crime scene tape down below the hotel. And then even better, I shared a room with Marcus, actually, who was, I think, Salon Games Master then.
And we had a leaking air conditioning unit, which leaked on our faces all night.
Like water torches.
And the absolute piece to resistance was that one of the nights we went out and we bumped into the publishers, and it turned out that they put themselves up in a five-star hotel in downtown Atlanta that had its own shopping mall.
It is as it ever was.
Yeah. But that was a crazy time. I mean, that was the first time I'd ever been to E3, and that was when that was just before GoldenEye came out, I think, because that was the first time I played GoldenEye.
You'll remember this, but GoldenEye had almost no fanfare whatsoever. Like it sort of came out of nowhere. You know, like I'm not saying that no one knew anything about it, but no one had any expectation for it whatsoever.
I just remember at E3, it had like a really small part of the stand. There was only like maybe five or six screens playing GoldenEye. And so I played it.
I thought, God, this is really good. You know, like it was the opening level where you drop down into the toilets. And I just thought, well, this is really, really good, you know, and no one was talking about it.
GoldenEye was a real like bolt from the blue.
That's crazy.
It genuinely came out of nowhere. And I think it was because no one had any expectation that a film license would be any good for one.
Right.
And I don't think anyone, I mean, obviously Rare had done stuff by then, but this was really the game that made them, you know, in a way. And I think that the level of input that Nintendo had into the game was unclear to start with until you kind of like started playing it and started talking to the guys at Rare. And it was obvious that they were, you know, had quite a symbiotic relationship with Nintendo.
So it was amazing. That was the first time I played GoldenEye. And I remember thinking, this is going to be great, you know, but it was really, really low key, like almost no presence on the stand whatsoever.
But it was a great, really interesting trip. And yeah, apart from the hotel, it was just a really, like the first moment I'd been to a show like that. Because, I mean, I was only probably maybe 1920.
Wow. You know, not old at all. So it was the first time I'd ever been, I'd been to the States once with my mom and dad when I was a kid.
But first time I'd been sort of traveled on my own and all that sort of stuff. It was a big moment, you know, and it was a brilliant show, you know. Atlanta was not amazing.
But.
Is it alright thinking just the whole thing was a bit more casual back then?
Oh, yeah, no, it was. Yeah, I mean, it wasn't. I mean, it wasn't even like I remember going to the LA one quite a few years later.
That was so like different, such a different vibe. You know, everything was highly controlled and you've got to sign an NDA to see this. And, you know, we're going to show you this behind closed doors, but not out on the stand or whatever.
And whereas back then, just everything was out, you know, what you saw is what you got. You know, and I think it was just again, fairly reflective, I think, of just how the video games, you know, market was then, you know.
Did you ever get to meet any of the Nintendo biggies, like, interviews-wise? Do you ever meet Miyamoto?
Yeah, met Miyamoto. Yeah, did an interview with him. It was a roundtable interview.
Or was it? Trying to think. I definitely did a roundtable interview with him.
I'm trying to think if I met him one-to-one. I don't think I did, actually. Remember old Howard Lincoln?
Who was the Nintendo US President? Did an interview with him. Who else?
I'm trying to think. Or Blimey.
Because it definitely, you know, when you go back and watch, like, older-y free footage and just generally how the games industry, like, carried itself, it all seemed a bit more informal. You know, like, the idea of putting you down in front of Miyamoto now is, like, such a controlled asset.
Yeah.
And, you know, like, if it's round tables, it's round tables and maybe supplying your questions in advance and this kind of thing. And, you know, I feel like people didn't really know how necessary, like, how important he was or what he was going to be or, you know, back then.
I mean, no, I don't think we did. I mean, like, we had a sort of... We had the kind of inside track, really, because the people on the mag, especially Will, were just so knowledgeable about Japanese gaming that he, you know, was well aware of how huge Miyamoto was and what a massive presence he was, you know.
And he was kind of like the front man, really, for Nintendo, you know, development in Japan. And I often wondered to myself, like, I wonder what... I wonder what other people at Nintendo Japan thought of that.
You know, the fact that he got... Oh, it's more Shigzee Magic, you know. You're like, what about all these people who worked on this game?
You know, like, it's just like... He's like... I mean, I'm sure he did have, like, a big...
I mean, clearly, he's a very talented man. It just always, like, made me think, you know, I wonder what the rest of the team thinks, like, oh, he's getting all the credit again, you know. But he was really...
he was just so engaging. And he was so quotable, you know, and just so, like, knowledgeable about gaming. And I had such a joyful kind of outlook on games and where video games needed to go.
And, you know, when you interviewed, not necessarily when I interviewed him, but when members of my team interviewed him or whatever, you always came away afterwards thinking, yeah, no, we're on the best console here. This is the one that's like... This is the one that's truly innovative.
You felt amazing, like being on a... He was like such a ball of kind of like positivity and talking about like the possibilities of development and development on a Nintendo machine and what it gave you that no other hardware gave you. And not that he was disparaging ever about rival hardware, but you just talked very specifically about, you know, what it was capable of doing.
And you just felt afterwards, yeah, like this is the place. You know, like he was just such an engaging front man for the developer. And I just think it's just exciting going and chatting to these people and, you know, talking to them about games.
And because there wasn't that, I mean, video games now is like movies, right? Like when you go and, you know, chat about a video game, where you go and talk to developers, it's like going into an interview with a film director or a film star. And it's like going into an interview at Warner Brothers or something.
Yeah, like it's highly, highly controlled, but back then it wasn't, you know, like you really felt like there was the possibility that when you went into an interview, you might come out with something genuinely exclusive, like a real massive world exclusive. Every time you went in, if you just got your questions right, you might come out with something that you could whack on the cover and it'd be a genuine, like world exclusive, you know? But that doesn't happen anymore.
No, it hasn't happened for a long time.
I know that you're well out of games now with your writing career and that you're not necessarily the heaviest gamer these days, but Miyamoto, he does some really weird stuff now because he's pretty much moved on from games and he designs their theme parks.
Oh, right.
I didn't realize that. Yeah, so that's kind of like his little passion project. So all the interviews you get with him, it's just about designing Mario Land at Universal Studios.
Oh, we went there in September, actually.
Oh, did you like it? What was it like?
It's really good, actually. It is good. The Mario Kart ride is really clever.
It's very complicated. Like, you put on this Mario Kart hat, you know, and it's got like a visor on it. And it took us ages.
I consider myself relatively smart. You know, I'm not saying I'm a total brainiac, but like I'm not a thiccy. I was on there with my daughter, who's 18 and quite smart.
And both of us were like, what the fuck is going on here? Like, I don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing. And then we realized that you had to, like, look around and like use your...
I'm doing this. I don't know why I'm doing this, because people can't see it. You had to look around and kind of take out.
And then once you've got it, we did it a second time and a third time. It's really, really good. You know, the first time is just so confusing.
But the actual, you know, the actual Mario, the actual Nintendo land thing is amazing. Like, it's so well done. It's quite small.
Well, we went to Universal Hollywood. I don't know what it's like at the Florida one, but or the Japanese one. But Universal Hollywood, it's small, but it's really well done.
Yeah, yeah. I need to get out there. I've not seen it myself.
So it's on my bucket list.
It's worth doing.
Maybe it's just sort of treading on the toes of the E3 stuff. But a question we always ask people who work on magazines, do you have any other good trip stories that you want to tell? Like, did you do anything with truly wild excess or just a really weird thing?
I would say that going to Atlanta in the world's worst hotel was probably up there. I remember we went one year to… When I was at LA E3, we went to the Playboy Mansion.
That was weird. There was a party at the Playboy Mansion.
Was it gaming related?
Yeah, there was a get… There was a Playboy game, I think.
Oh, there was a Playboy Mansion, the game. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. So, we did that. And then that was quite just very weird.
Very small, the Playboy Mansion. Well, it seemed a lot smaller than I thought it would be. I thought it would be like this massive sprawling mansion, but it's…
I've heard it's quite creepy there.
We didn't go…
We didn't go… It's like an old man's house, basically.
Yeah, we didn't go inside. We were just out in the garden around the… What do they call it?
The grotto. The swimming pool. And there were obviously lots of scantily clad women and stuff, you know.
It all felt a bit… A little bit creepy and kind of uncomfortable. So yeah, that was…
I did that. I remember one trip I did, I think it was when I was on XBox World. We did to Palm Springs.
I think it was a Vendy.
Not Scarface.
Well, no, it wasn't. That was a different trip. I did a Scarface trip to Marbella, which is really good.
But no, we did a… It was before Scarface came out, although there may have been Scarface there. I think it was just Fear had just been on Xbox or whatever.
But that was a good trip to Palm Springs because it was back in the days when press trips were… He sort of went out for longer than he really needed to go out for. So we were in Palm Springs for this event for a couple of days.
And then the lady who was the Vendy PR took us to San Diego for a few days. And we drove a convertible down there and stuff. And it was just a great American road trip.
So yeah, there were quite a few trips. I mean, the thing is with me, I didn't actually do as many trips as maybe some other people did. Because I never got to go to Japan, which I was really sad about.
I always wanted to go to Japan and I still want to go to Japan. But I didn't do as many trips because I actually got married quite young. And then we had our daughter when I was still in my late 20s.
So I didn't do a lot of foreign trips because I felt like it wasn't really the right thing to do. You're a good man Tim Weaver. They had to come at the right time for me really.
So I did a few but not as many as I could have done. I got offered absolutely tons. But I couldn't do them all.
Editors often didn't just because they had to be there pushing the mag forward.
E3 and stuff, definitely. But some of these trips you didn't necessarily need an editor there. I remember Rockstar always wanted editors at the end.
But most other, I mean, obviously all the publishers wanted editors because editors made decisions about what was going to go in the mag and what wasn't. But there's only so much you can do, especially because you also have to get a magazine. So you can't go away for a week every month, or not on some jolly.
So and to be honest, again, those sorts of things started to dry up after a while. You didn't get those big trips anymore. Everyone was tightening their belts.
And when you did get those trips, it was very, very highly controlled. So it wasn't like the level of freedom that you had back when you were doing it in the good old days.
You obviously came back to N64 for the NGC rebrand, and you were the launch editor for that. I believe Mark Green was your dept head as well.
Yeah, he was, yeah.
Who was my former boss. What was that like? Did that feel like kind of coming home?
Yeah, that was great. Loved that. Really good.
I don't know what year that was, but it was still a period where there was a degree of ownership and freedom for editors. And again, I had a great team who were really... Geraint Evans was my staff writer, I think, on that.
And yeah, got Greener on it. Dan Geary, I think, was the Prod Ed. He was brilliant.
Such a good fun, you know, really good fun. And so, yeah, so just a great team, really, you know, like really good people on it again. And that made the difference.
And, you know, like I came on board, really, and wasn't really given any great steer on what they wanted to achieve. It was more just like, I think Steve Jarrett was the senior editor at that time. And I remember having a meeting with him and Steve was always really good about stuff.
He would just, he knew that you were like, you knew what you were doing. So he kind of let you get on with it. And then, but obviously, if you needed his opinion on what kind of ideas or whatever thrown around, he was always there and a great support.
I like Steve a lot, like a really good, really good person to have kind of going out to bat with you on the senior side, but not micromanaging you the whole time, which is what I definitely didn't need by then. And so, yeah, so just just never had a great list of like, we need to achieve this, we need to achieve this. I'm just kind of given like a fairly free hit at it.
And yeah, so we came in and redesigned the logo, obviously, to make it look a bit like the N64 one. And then we relaunched it again with a different logo in the sort of square format that we did.
Oh, yeah, that was I love that format of magazine.
Yeah, it was great. I fought hard for that. I fought hard for that.
Because I said like, we need to have some point of difference, you know, because by then magazines were getting harder, a lot harder, you know, you weren't selling what you was. I mean, at one point, the N64 magazine sold more than the official magazine sold, official Nintendo magazine sold, you know, so we were smashing it out of the park in those days. But by the time we relaunched NGC, and especially by the time we went to the square format, the internet was here, and magazines were finding it a little bit harder.
So you had to kind of go big or go home, you know, but you needed to like, you needed to try and do something that was going to get you noticed. We knew that we would get by doing what we did in the square format and stuff, we would try and recapture some of that audience that we gathered in the days of N64, you know, like this, we tried to do those big reviews. We tried to focus in on the big games and give them like constant coverage so that it felt like, because you know, the thing we always tried to keep in mind was that games are expensive, you know, so, you know, even though we're getting lots and lots of games every single month, most readers are only getting maybe three or four games a year, you know, so if you're lucky, you know, so it's, it was important to really sustain the coverage of the big games.
And then we tried to bring in some of that humor that, you know, it's so, so sort of suited and...
No, it was brilliant. I mean, Salt My Maze was classic. I still like, it felt like every, you know, margin and box out, you know, wherever you could cram something, there was something.
I used to like the thing where people sent in pictures of people of like shit gaming in films and TV. That was a bit of like Tony Soprano not being able to play Mario Kart or whatever, stuff like that. I just, you know, that's, that's the stuff that really sticks with me.
It's like the sort of minutia and above and beyond.
I remember we did, The Back Page was a pun on an established game. So it would be like NBA hanging time and it would be like, we'd mock up some basketball player being hung by a noose from a basketball ring, you know, and it would, then we'd do a review of that. It's all that sort of stuff.
You know, it was just like a fun kind of.
Yeah, but that was, it was N64, it was Bill, was it Bill Oddie's, Bill Oddie's body? It wasn't Bill Oddie's body harvest, it was Bill Oddie's harvest. Yeah, yeah.
And it was just like giant Bill Oddie, sort of stuck into a screenshot body harvest. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, that was fun, that was. I really enjoyed, I really enjoyed that. I remember we, it was in a Bill, I don't know if you ever worked in there, it was in a building that was sort of away from some of the other ones.
We moved, only some mags had moved in there and we got the top floor, so we had an amazing office as well. It was right on the top floor and it had beautiful views of Bath, and it was just, we felt like we were up there on our own. We used to play, the GTA Vice City had just come out, and so we used to play the soundtrack really loud up there, and we used to, it was brilliant, like just a great period.
I was really, really happy then, really happy at work, and just having a, I mean, obviously there were some stresses and stuff.
Yeah, sure.
I'm trying to remember, I don't know where the other guys, like Jez and that were at that time. I know Jez did freelance for us.
They all seemed to kind of move in and out of orbit of it, because yeah, when they were all together, it's kind of hard to pinpoint in my memory.
Yeah, I mean, the thing is they were all so talented, that obviously they were going off and doing different things. I mean, the thing with Greener was that he ended up going to Nintendo, working for Nintendo in Germany at some point. But he was...
Or did he go and work for Arcade afterwards? Did he go and work for Arcade?
He definitely worked at Arcade for a bit.
I can't remember. But anyway, you know, just like ridiculously talented people who were just... You know, I remember Greener...
I'm trying to remember if it was the old NGC or maybe it was N64. I think it was N64 actually. I remember when Shadow Man came out.
Do you remember that game, Shadow Man?
Yeah, is this the... interviewing the FBI?
Yeah, interviewing the FBI profiler. And it was incredible. Like, I mean, he just went above and beyond, you know, and like the feature was...
I said to him, I remember saying to him after I'd read it, I was like, Greener, that is absolutely outstanding. You know, like you've gone and you've spent... Because he had to call him in the evenings.
Yeah, so he sort of, he basically went and found like an FBI profiler.
Rusty, it was Rusty someone, Rusty something or other. And he was like, I remember one morning, Greener told me this great story. He said he was interviewing Rusty, whatever his name was.
And he said, oh, you know, I was interviewing last night and he said, oh, he's talking about people in prison. He said, oh, they do some crazy stuff. He said, oh, I once had to, someone in one of the prisons built a, in the workshop in the prison, built a truck to drive out of the prison.
And I was like, Blimey, how did they do that without anyone noticing? He said, and the twist was that it was Rusty's son-in-law.
It was just brilliant. Like the stuff that he got, it was great. Greener was really, really, really good at that stuff.
Like you'd say to him, or a lot of the time he just came up with this stuff himself. He'd be like, oh, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that.
You know, and you'd be like, I don't know whether you're going to be able to pull this off. But he always, always did. Probably as I would say Greener, I worked with some really talented people, but I would say Greener was probably as close to a proper journalist as I ever worked with.
And what I mean by that is like he could have easily written for any magazine, not just a gaming magazine. Like he had that nose for a story and he had that every man kind of way about his writing that made it just, you know, you didn't have to know anything about video games being completely engaged by a very smart guy with a really, with real, real talent, you know.
The one time he got it wrong on NGamer was we did a news, it was a feature, a comedy, it was only like a quarter of the page, but it was, it said in our new regular feature, you have to guess a famous obituary where we've replaced the person's name with Shigeru Miyamoto and it was Sadamu Sane.
It was really bleak, it was incredibly bleak and we did it one issue. I thought it was really funny, but there was some discussion about it at the time.
Was it a discussion with who? The publishers?
No, no, just on the team, I remember like our public being like, is this in good taste? That's awesome. I love that magazine.
Yeah, it was really good fun. Again, just a really, really good time. And I was really excited for the GameCube.
I know it was a long time ago, but did you feel the same way for the GameCube that you did the N64? I never felt it was quite as all-encompassing as it was to N64.
No, it wasn't. I think I wasn't, in all honesty, I wasn't as engaged with the console as I was with N64. I loved working on the magazine.
And I loved the people I worked with. It was a brilliant, like I said, I was really, really happy during that period. Because between N64 and going back to NGC, I had been shipped around a bit.
They took me off N64 basically to launch a magazine called Video Gamer, which they...
That's a weekly thing, right?
Yeah, they said to me, it's going to be a weekly magazine and it's going to be for casual gamers, you know, people, or rather, people who aren't like hardcore into games, you know, and kind of need a sort of once a week 99p, it was supposed to be 99p, easy to read, kind of basically top line view of what's going on in games. And they said, that sounds really interesting. And they said, we want you to launch it.
And I was like, yeah, I'd love to do that because this has the potential to be huge, you know, because gaming was really exploding at then. The future really futured it up. Like, they, we designed the whole mag, right, from scratch.
We were about four weeks out from launching. And they said to us, oh, it's not going to be 99p, it's going to be 199. Now, it doesn't sound like a lot, but that's a big leap, right?
When you got under a quid, like, it's almost like a, you don't even think about it. You just put it in your shopping trolley or whatever, you pick it up and you don't think about it. Anything over a quid, it makes a big difference.
And it was on deliberately shat paper stock, so it was very disposable and stuff. So 199 felt like it was too expensive. The other thing they did was about a few days later after that bombshell, they turned around and said, actually, we're not going to make it weekly, we're going to make it monthly.
I was like, but we've designed the entire mag as a weekly mag, you know, everything in it, the content, everything that we've put in there is designed for a weekly audience. You know, like we haven't got the depth to it that you need for a monthly magazine. And I said, this magazine is supposed to be like one of the big things about it was supposed to be the news side of things.
You know, like it's going to be really bang up to date. And it's not going to be like that if you're only coming out once every month. And of course the magazine completely died on its ass.
And the other thing, I remember one thing. We had a brilliant story in like episode two or whatever. One of our news ads on there had got wind of what the Xbox might look like.
So we designed like a mock up for it and we put it on the cover and we sent it to press and we were saying, is this what the Xbox looks like? And the publishers at Future went absolutely fucking mental because they were in the process of like trying to secure the net like again, secure the official Xbox license for the magazine. And they went absolutely mental, even though we were doing exactly what we'd been asked to do, which is go out and just find stories and stuff.
The whole thing was just a massive cock up. And that was the first time I think where I started to think to myself, this isn't like this isn't the company that I joined. This isn't the same company that did N64 Magazine anymore.
But going back to NGC afterwards, it felt like going back a little bit into something more comfortable and something a bit happier and that. But yeah, it was just a very different... That was when it started to change.
So NGC just came out a good time and I happened to be lucky. I had great people on there and we had a really, really good time making it.
This might be really wide of a mark as an observation, but obviously you were an editor for a long time, from 1999 to the mid 2010s on many different magazines. My impression was that you were someone who really loved the buzz of the magazine team and the craft of the thing, maybe more so than specifically covering the games. You liked being an editor.
Yeah. Do you think that's fair?
I think that is fair. Yeah, I think that is fair. I really enjoyed games.
There is a brilliant, brilliant industry to be in. It's such, such fun, such fun. I look back on those years really, really fondly.
But yeah, that would be true. I love the craft side of things. I love making magazines.
I love the creativity of it. I liked working with talented people who you could go to the pub with and shoot ideas around and just laugh constantly for an hour and then take those ideas and back and just create something really amazing. It's a special sort of time that it doesn't ever felt like work.
It never felt like work. It felt like just being just around your mates and just having a great time. And obviously managing people, a lot of people hated it.
I loved it. And maybe it was just because I was lucky. The majority of the people I managed were really, really brilliant people.
So I loved being around those people and coming to work was just a joy. I loved that stuff. So yeah, it would be true.
I think maybe it would be true to say that if I had been writing about films or TV or whatever, I would have been the same. I would have felt the same. I loved games, loved being in games and met some brilliant people in it.
There were many, many video games that I played that I loved. But I wouldn't say I was playing games like you played them or whatever, the way you're playing them all the time, you know. I definitely was never like that.
But yeah, so I think that probably would be fair. I loved the craft side of things and just the people, yeah.
What about, I have to ask about the only time we ever directly worked together was in the Games Hub.
The Games Hub.
Which was, basically took, you know, as they went on, they merged Xbox One 360 and PSN3 together. And they formed like a mega editorial team. And then there was like a writing pool, which for a long time was, you were managing it and it was me and Andy Kelly.
It was, yeah.
And I just, like it totally wasn't what I wanted to happen in my career. But I, it was a lot of fun.
My recollection of that year, if that was a year, was it?
Yeah, it was about a year, yeah.
My recollection of that year was just constantly laughing for a whole year.
Yeah.
I mean, we used to have such a laugh, didn't we? I mean, like, because it was depressing otherwise, wasn't it? The game's hub was just so depressing.
It was like corporate mega structure. You know, just like, that was how it got, you know, not just the future, other places as well. You know, just like, we're going to have a pool of writers writing a hashtag content across everywhere, you know.
And it was all about the internet, right? The internet stories and stuff, you know. And yeah, you, me and Andy Kelly, that was fun.
That was fun. We had a really good laugh on there. I remember you and me.
I'm glad you remember it that way because in my head, that is what it was like. And everyone else was having such a rough time.
I think that was the only way we could really get through the misery of being in the games hub. I mean, you know, I went from the highs of editing these mags to running a games hub, you know, which they said, oh, you know, but eventually you're going to have this many writers. And I was like, I don't really care.
This isn't what I want to do, you know? And then I remember they said to me before I was on Xbox World and then they decided to merge Xbox World and PSN3. And then they decided to merge them and basically make them the same mag but designed for two different And I remember there was only one editor's role on it.
You know, because obviously Dan Dawkins was editing PSN3 and I was like, well, I don't want to do the editor's role because I don't want to edit two magazines. And by then, you know, my writing, my book writing had sort of started to take off a bit. I thought I don't want to, you know, eat into that.
So that was one of the reasons I took the game's hub role. But I mean, it was pretty shat. I mean, it was a pretty, it was a pretty dumb job, but we had a really good laugh on anyway.
Yeah, I just, I feel like after a year, we were so deep into our in jokes that it was just completely baffling to anyone sitting near us. Like, I remember actually sat near Charlotte, Martin was obviously still editing the NGamer, Nintendo Gamer bit of it, and sat next to us, directly behind us, and was constantly turning around and completely baffled by whatever bullshit we were talking for solid five hours.
I think you basically needed to do that though, because otherwise, if you took a moment to look at the reality of what we were doing, it was just so massively depressing.
You obviously mentioned it there that your book writing had taken off at this point, and obviously, this is a huge part of the Tim Weaver stories. I do want to touch on it, that in your last four or five years on the magazines, you're also writing on the site. I know you've told this story a billion times, but I was always fascinated by how anyone could do this job in the day and pursue that with such discipline.
When does that journey start and where does that drive come from?
To be perfectly honest with you, I could see the writing on the wall at Future. I was just like... I wouldn't say I was ever unhappy at Future.
I wasn't ever unhappy, but I think towards the end, I just wasn't enjoying it as much. The people kept me happy. The people I worked with kept me happy, but I wasn't happy about the work itself.
I certainly wasn't happy about... I accepted that the internet was where it was going, but the internet didn't interest me like major magazines did. Making magazines didn't interest me at that point really, either because it wasn't the same anymore.
It was so highly controlled the whole time. For example, when you do a cover, I remember Future went through a stage where he had to do a cover, and he had to get it signed off by two different publishers. Of course, every time you went and got it signed off by one, the other will be like, I don't like this, or I don't like this.
Then you had to go back. It was designed by committee, and it was just awful. It was that sort of stuff, and it was really grinding me down.
At the same time, I thought, well, what is my exit strategy here? One of the things that Future always had was it was based in Bath, and Bath is a really lovely place to live. The only other place where you could perhaps go and do the same sort of thing would be up in London.
That's obviously a big, I mean, you went and worked in London for a while, but it's a big leap, especially for someone who was married with a kid. It's not something that you can really just do. So I thought to myself, what is my exit strategy here?
Now, I've been writing a book on and off for a long, long time, way before I ever got published. Maybe it took me about 10 years to get published. I've been writing this book on and off, and I thought to myself, I need to go back to it and start concentrating on and try and get it off the ground.
And I had been working on this, what would become my debut novel for a long time. And I went back to it with renewed vigor, really, like about maybe six years before I left Future. At that point, I'd sent it out quite a few years before to a lot of literary agents, and they'd all rejected it and sent for various reasons.
It wasn't any good, or it wasn't the type of thing they wanted to represent or whatever. So I basically rewrote it and kind of re-edited it and just did a massive re-write on it. And I did it in the evenings, really, because the motivation for it, you ask where the drive came from, the drive came from just thinking, I can't be here in another five years or six years' time.
And I don't mean that as a disparaging thing, but we just joked about the games hub, but that was how it was going. I couldn't hand on heart tell you that I thought, in five years, I'll be happy to be on the games hub still. You know, like it was...
I'd be still laughing away too.
Yeah, I'd still be laughing with you. Both of us, like, prison sentence, you know? Like, prisoners just like, like in The Shawshank Redemption.
But, and I thought that was where the drive came from. The actual, you know, physical act of writing a book whilst being a journalist was so frigging hard. My work, like, because the journalism was just so all encompassing and the hours were always quite hard.
You know, you worked a lot of late nights and that sort of stuff. So it was just fitting in around, around the work. And what was even more of a miracle to me now, looking back, is not really getting the first book written.
It was getting books two, three and four written while I was doing journalism. I mean, that was, I don't know, I honestly don't know how I did it. I genuinely, I'm not taking the piss.
I honestly don't know how I did it because, well, I know how I did it. I was doing 17 hour days, six days a week for four years. That's how I did it, but it almost broke me.
It really did. It was really, really hard. But the thing that kept me going was the knowledge that, this is, number one, what I've always wanted to do.
I've always wanted to write a book. And number two, I thought, well, this is the next stage for me after future. If I can make even a moderate living from this, then this can be where I go from here.
And so that was what really kept me going. And in a weird way, the end of future where it was really quite miserable in some ways, because it was just changing such a lot and it becomes so corporate and so stringent, and there were so many redundancy processes. There must have been three or four in the last three or four years I was there.
That was a weirdly good thing for me, because it made me more determined to get out. The irony was is that when I was ready to, because my fourth book came out and it got into the Richard and Judy Book Club, which was really a big thing for an author back then. And I thought right now, it's going to make a huge difference to my sales.
And I think now is the time I can get out. And I said, I'll take redundancy. And they were like, now you're too expensive.
And I was like, are you kidding me? Like the money in the future pay is an absolute joke. I'm not that expensive, you know.
But the problem was, was that I was on an old contract.
Right, right.
So instead of having to pay me the standard redundancy, they had to pay me three weeks for every year I've been there, instead of one week. Which in the grand scheme of things, wouldn't have cost them that much anyway. But they fought back against it a lot.
And I was like, just in fairness, Tim Clark, who was the senior editor there at Future at the time, I basically begged him and said, please make me redundant. Like, and he was like, they don't want to make you redundant. I was like, can you just go in and sell it, sell the dream to them?
You know? And he did, you know, and I owe Tim that big favor because he did, he did go in and sell the dream to them. And then he just came back, okay, we're going to do your redundancy.
And I felt just like a huge, huge measure of relief then. Because I felt like, because I had doubts about it. When I'd asked for redundancy, I had those sort of doubts you get niggling at you like, it's quite safe at future, like, you know, like, yeah, yeah.
But it was good for me because it gave me a bit of a push. And, you know, I've been doing writing ever since.
Yeah. So you're on Raker number 14 now?
14 has came out in Harback last year. The paperback for 14 comes out in April, I think, next year. And then 15 I'm editing at the moment and 16 I've just started writing.
So it's absolutely wild. I still like, you know, so, you know, when you do your books come out and you do your book launches, you know, you do them at, you tend to do one in bath at a bookshop somewhere. And every time I go, it's just like, it's not not mind blowing from a, they're turning out for Tim, but like, you know, in the perspective of just like, like what a, you know, what a crazy thing, you know, like I know you from this completely other thing, you know, and you've, you've kind of built this whole other kind of creative life for yourself.
I mean, I've often heard you say that like this, you're basically living your dream life now, right? And this is, this is it. I mean, it must be odd having done like 20 years of like collaborative work, you know, on magazines to, to, you know, probably one of the most, most solitary professions there is, where it's just you and the book.
I mean, how do you kind of sort of square that?
Yeah, I mean, that's a really good point. I mean, do you know one of the things that I worried about most when I, when I left Future was, how am I going to sort of cope on my own? Because I don't mind my own company at all, but one of the things that really kept me going through some pretty disappointing last couple of years at Future in terms of what I was being asked to do and where I was in my career was the people.
The people like you when we had such a laugh on the game server, people I worked with on the Xbox World, and then the people in and around Future who I just really liked. I spent a long time being in the same environment. That was what I worried about was what would I do on my own.
Do you know what? Actually, it's been fine. It is different.
But what I love about writing books is that, number one, I don't have clueless managers telling me to do stuff that I know is not right. So that's one massive bonus for it. The other bigger bonus is that I get to be my own boss.
Obviously, I'm published by Penguin, so the people at Penguin are my work colleagues in a way. I don't spend every single day with them, but I know them really well. I have really close relationship with my editor at Penguin and she's become a really good friend.
My agent has become a really good friend of mine. These are people that you see not all the time, but you talk to them relatively frequently. Then you obviously meet other writers through various events and there are a couple of other writers locally that I meet up with for coffee and lunches and stuff.
You get your social side from that. Then obviously, I suppose if I lived entirely by myself, then maybe it would be different. Obviously, I've got my wife, got my daughter still at home.
It's not like I'm completely by myself the whole time. It's the best of both worlds really. I get to spend the day by myself, working, just being creative the whole time.
Now, not all of writing books is creative. There is a lot of slog as well to it. Editing is a slog.
It is a slog, especially when you're going through different revisions of the book with your editor, and your copy editor and stuff. You're reading the book for the 10 zillionth time, and you're like, I have no critical judgment on this book whatsoever. I don't know if it's any good or not.
Because you have no capacity to read it in any way freshly. So you have no idea at all. So that can be hard.
There are other areas that are publishing books. It's a bit like publishing magazines, I think. It's a bit of a roller coaster.
For some years, you have amazing years, and some years are not quite as good. You know, it's very up and down. But I think if you look at the stats, actually it's really hard to make a career as a full-time author.
So I feel like I've at least achieved that much, and I make a pretty good career. It's sort of earning money, the sort of money that I never would have made in the future. So, you know, like it's been really good for me, and I've tried to be, you know, really, really grateful for that every single day, you know.
And I'm really, really grateful that people go out and buy my books. And in some ways, it's similar to magazines, because, you know, I was talking earlier about how readers really responded to certain things in N64 Magazine, and they feel like they knew you and they were part of a club. There's some similarities when you're writing books, because you get emails from readers, and you meet readers at events and stuff, and they really are completely invested in your writing.
That's what I get when I go to your book signings. There's always some question in the audience, and you're like, this person really cares, like, what happens to this guy? And it's like, you know, you're like, wow, like, to have that relationship with a stranger is pretty powerful.
It's amazing. It's amazing. And it never gets old, you know, like it doesn't.
Like, I'm just still amazed even now that people are so invested in the books and that these characters are so real for them. You know, like, I've been to events where they're like, you know, I love your books, but no offense. If you kill off such and such a character, I'm going to hunt you down.
You know, like, so it's just like, it's they're really invested in, you know, like, I suppose, you know, that does really have echoes of what we were talking about earlier in terms of magazines, you know, making people feel a part of something. And, you know, although I'm not, I can't claim to be as big as, you know, some of the authors that are right there. You know, I've sort of done all right for myself and have a sort of decent following of people.
And it just never gets old when people are like, I love your books, I love your characters, and please don't ever stop writing. You know, like, if people, you know, tell you that, it just feels amazing to think that people have had that connection with something you've written.
That's awesome. I mean, that feels like it almost sort of neatly circles around our whole conversation. So I don't want to, like, I don't want to add too much to that, just because I feel like that's kind of perfect.
You know, you've tapped into these, you know, similar energy in two different ways in like your two career paths. I mean, I guess, you know, I do just want to give you the opportunity to say, you know, to our readers who might not know your books. I mean, for the eight billionth time in your career, if you just want to explain who David Raker is and what the books are about.
Yeah, sure. Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so. Yeah, the books, I've written 15 books.
14 are part of a series, but they can be read as standalone. So you can come at any point in the series and there'll be no barrier to entry in them. And they all feature a missing, the 14 books all feature a missing persons investigator called David Raker.
And in each book, he looks into a mysterious and unexplained disappearance. And the disappearance is always something really extraordinary. For example, a man disappears on a packed commuter train going between stations, or a whole village disappears overnight in Yorkshire.
That's a good one.
So there's those kinds of things. And every book deals with these disappearances. And he is the man.
And so it's a series that over a long period of time, if you read it from beginning to end, the characters develop in a certain way. But as I say, you can come at any stage, and there won't be any barrier to entry. And then there's a 15th book, which is called Missing Pieces, which is a standalone, but definitely set in what I like to call Rakerverse.
Rakerverse! Yeah. It's got some crossover in certain areas.
And again, if it's a standalone, you can read it in whatever order you like. So, yeah, so I mean, you know, you can find out more at timweaverbooks.com. You know, if you like reading thrillers, then, you know.
Deep down, do you have a, like a, you know, you sort of put a gun to your head and went, the first one, where should I start? Just like you say, they are standalone, but there is a thread through them as well.
I think there are certain points in this series that you could come in at and they probably operate really, really effectively as standalones, with no crossover whatsoever, or no continuation in terms of plot arcs. I would say probably one of them is I Am Missing, which is about a bloke that washes up on a Dorset coast with no memory of who he is or where he came from. And he asked David Rake to find out who he is.
That's got, that operates pretty effectively as standalone. You know, No One Home, which is the one where the whole village disappears. That's pretty good as a standalone.
And The Blackbird, which is quite a recent one. A lot of people have said to me that that's been their first one. And they said that they didn't even realize it was part of a series.
So, but like I say, you know, you can come at any point, any of the books really. I think, you know, what is certainly true is that as you go through, like with any creative endeavor, you know, you become better as a writer. So my debut is probably the only book in my series that I would love to do again.
You know, have a new book on it.
I'm not saying it's a terrible book. I'm just saying that there's certain things on it that I may have done differently. Lots of people still love it.
In fact, for some people, it's still their best book, their favorite book. But I feel like it's, there's some stuff in there, particularly in terms of Raker's character, that is not quite as good as it could be. And obviously, the more further through the series you get, I think the more accomplished the books become.
Which were the ones that got Richard and Judy on the hook?
Never Coming Back, which was Book 4, which is the one I got published when I left Future. Then No One Home, which is the one about the village. That was Book 10, Village Disappearing.
And then The Blackbird, which is Book...
Three, three Richard and Judy's.
Yeah, so it's been...
Do you get told which one of Richard and Judy digs it?
Or is it both? I've met them a few times, actually, and they're both quite engaged. They're actually really...
Whatever perception you have of them, what I will say for them is that they are incredibly engaged and they're a really big advocate of writers. I think there's a lot to be said to that. I really like them.
I think they're really nice people.
They've certainly done a lot for you. Yeah, they've always been very pleasant to me.
Yeah. That's awesome. Well, this feels like a good place to wrap it up.
Yeah, obviously, definitely go and check out the books and check out Tim's site as a base of all information. What's next on the horizon we should be looking out for? So, it's the paperback in April.
Yeah, so Paperback of the Missing Family comes out in April and then my new book The Lost Women comes out beginning of 2026. So, 2025 is I will actually have a new book out and that's to make a bit of space for some other things.
Other projects, well, yes, I'm excited for those and people should sign up for your newsletter and you get all the updates for that.
I should make you my PR and marketing.
Yeah, I know. It's good, isn't it? Tim, it's been awesome to talk to you.
It's kind of a funny one pitching this because I obviously know you really well. We do hang out and work with you for ages. So, hopefully this wasn't too formal and weird.
No, it was brilliant. It was nice to go back actually and just chat about those days. Sometimes I wish my memories of it were a bit clearer, but it was just such a long time ago that you remember more the way you felt about those years, more than specific things, but it was great chatting about it.
Thank you for having me on.
No, not at all. No, it was great. Thank you for being the first person to tell a bit of the N64 NGC story.
Super important to me as a reader and like I say, incredibly influential on how I've done things myself. So yeah, it was awesome. Thanks very much for chatting.
Thank you for having me on.
What a great listen and as agreed, we won't comment on the audio quality of the episode whatsoever. Matthew, how are you feeling about the Tim Weaver interview now that it's wrapped up?
Are you having a chat? Yeah, I enjoyed myself. If you hear any weird creaks on top of the bad audio, if you hear any creaks, that's me leaning back in my very creaky chair and just enjoying the chat, which very rarely happens because I normally lean in for these.
I have to really focus, but I forgot myself while we were recording this.
Such a good time that you just forgot yourself basically. That's funny. Well, very good.
I'm pleased we finally got Tim on the episode. So do you talk about where you can go find his books?
Yes, that's all in there.
Okay, great. In which case, fine. No need to do that.
But thanks to Tim for coming on. That's awesome. We were finally able to get him.
Hopefully it leads to more from the N64 sort of like cabal of writers and editors down the line, Matthew. In the meantime, you can get us on social media at backpagepod. I'm Samuel W.
Roberts on social media, Blue Sky, Twitter and Letterboxd. Matthew, where are you?
I am Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd. That's basically where I'm doing most of my stuff.
Yeah, Matthew is a good follow on Letterboxd. I'm enjoying the content. Thanks.
It's a good time.
I thought some were low scores. They're going to seem shocking to you.
Gave Austin Powers a higher score than The Brutalist. You'll love to see it. You'll love to see it.
I had a lot of fun with it. That's what films are rated on. How much fun they are.
Same, brother. Okay, good. The podcast is supported by Patreon, patreon.com/backpagepod.
We have no ads whatsoever. We never do sponsored content or anything like that. It's all completely supported by you, the listeners.
We're very grateful for the support that we get. I thought I'd give people a little preview of what's coming up, Matthew, at patreon.com/backpagepod. In the regular episode feed this month, this is obviously the episode with Tim Weaver, but we also have the best games of 2004 coming up on February 14th.
February 21st, we have another guest, Dave Dewitt, formerly of GameSpot, is coming on to talk about video game guns and the best Warhammer games. You might remember Dave's. Basically, a subject area me and Matthew are not qualified to discuss.
I can't, though. We know that listeners would quite like to hear about. Also, Dave has something to come on and talk about, that he's been working on at the video side.
You are probably familiar with Dave's Expert Reacts videos, where he gets a fellow, I think he's called Jonathan, from the Royal Armouries Museum, to come on and talk about video game guns and reconcile them with reality. Great videos, really beautifully made. I think he really just created his own little corner of the internet there.
Excited to have Dave come on and talk about that and what he's up to now. We also have the final regular episode of the month, is The Magic of Monster Hunter. We're going to hopefully get some early keys for that game, Monster Hunter Wilds.
Yes, that's right. We're going to have a special guest for that one. We'll talk a little bit about why the series has been so successful, how it's gradually taken off in the West, but also has been this mainstay in Japan for a long time.
This is obviously going to be a huge moment. Probably if GTA doesn't come out this year, probably going to be the biggest game of the year as well, so an important thing to talk about. Then for Patreon exclusive on the XL tier, you get 50 further things in games that make us go, that's coming on February 10th.
Basically just a list of cool stuff we like in games that is satisfying to recount, Matthew. We've done one episode of that before and then one we didn't like, and then this is a return to the positive version of that, so it should be good. XXL, two giant men rewatch the Austin Powers movies.
Never have I seen more comments about a single episode of this podcast before it's even been recorded than this one. I think people are quite excited about this, Matthew, as a coda to our James Bond ranking episode, which people seem to quite like. How are you feeling about the Austin Powers project?
Yeah, I am halfway through the Spy Chagme. We'll be finishing that tonight while I eat some lasagna.
Nice. We've got a great evening planned. So that's what's coming up, and yeah, thank you for listening, and we'll be back next week.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
