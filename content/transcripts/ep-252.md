Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. Have you been enjoying the life post your bit of freelance that was giving you so much grief last week? How does the world seem to you now?
Is it full of opportunity? Are you excited about the future?
Oh, so many opportunities. Opportunities to play Mario Galaxy 1 and 2. For some reason, and maybe it's just Mario Galaxy making me feel nostalgic for a certain period of my life, but I actually started playing Metroid Other M on Sunday.
Oh wow, okay. That's really taking the wee thing, that one step further. That's interesting.
I am completely back in my 2007 to 2010 self.
Oh no.
Minus my general body size.
Yeah, and you have a wife now.
That is also true. Yeah.
And a house. So these are all cats, all kinds of things, really. Yes, that's funny, because I did wonder if this, that would do that to you, because yes, this episode is two giant men play Super Mario Galaxy and then I'm patron this month.
patreon.com/backpagepod, we're doing Mario Galaxy 2. So I have also been teleported back in time a little bit in mindset by playing this game. It really does, for whatever reason, I think maybe it's the specific attention paid to things like sound design that trigger things in your memory in that very sort of like powerful way.
But yeah, this reminds me of sitting in my basement flat in Bournemouth where Sunlight could barely reach, where I had like three new spiders to deal with every day, existing on 299 whole chickens from Little, as previously discussed on episode 200. So it took me all the way back to that, Matthew.
A pre-financial crash, a period of time which is just so beautifully encapsulated by the jaunty tune of the Honey Hive Galaxy. That's just the tune that doesn't make sense post 2008.
It really makes you think of the end of New Labour when you hear that music, doesn't it? It certainly takes you back.
Do, do, do, do, do, yeah.
That's the other page exclusive this month, is that Matthew is going to hum every iconic theme from Super Mario Galaxy for you on a, it will actually be available on Vinyl from Lost in Cult, so you can look forward to that next year. That would be good. Okay, Matthew.
So this episode then, all about this one game, Super Mario Galaxy, discussed on this podcast. As part of list features many times, it was, I think, number one with Super Mario Galaxy 2 in our torturously long Nintendo top 50 that we did last year. It has obviously come up sporadically since in drafts and best games of 2007.
But a whole episode all about it, how are you feeling about tackling it in this particular format?
I'm excited to hear you talk about it more than anything because, I know you have a relationship with this game, but I feel like you've dived into it more than ever before, and I'm more intrigued to hear your thoughts. But I'm happy to rehash my own.
Yeah, we'll get into our specific relationships with the game and how we're approaching it from two different angles really for this episode. But I thought we'd start with a bit of background of the game Matthew, so hopefully there is a fantastic Awaata asks on this game from the time. So has interviews with Miyamoto, with the sound team, with the main design team behind the game.
It's really detailed and incredibly useful when you want to pass off rich information as your own in a podcast form, as I'm about to do. And the interesting thing about this is that the origins of the game go back to Mario 128, a tech demo shown at Spaceworld 2000. I'm sure a lot of our listeners remember this, because it was spammed all over magazines following Spaceworld that year.
I remember seeing a lot of images of this. I don't think I'd ever actually seen the video of this until today, but it's lots of Marios on a flying saucer shaped object. The shape of the saucer is then warped and it sends a load of the different Marios bouncing around.
There's 128 of them eventually, as the name suggests. And then the saucer is transformed into a pizza and they're all fired into the abyss after that. And the specific camera perspective and shape of the level.
I would say that you can see the larval form of what would become Super Mario Galaxy in this demo. And it was the starting point of conceptualizing the game. The goal was to create spherical levels where Mario could roam around, which was more of a challenge than the saucer shaped level as shown in this demo.
So all of this was Shigeru Miyamoto's brain child and something he pushed for from the early 2000s, the idea of a game that uses gravity and spherical worlds to show players things they'd never seen before. Matthew, I wanted to pick up from there. Do you see the origins of Super Mario Galaxy in Mario 128?
Yeah, definitely in the landmass and just the visual of a strange shaped object floating in a void with 128 Marios on it. The demo itself is so cursed that it's quite hard to draw a through line from that to the distinctly uncursed Mario Galaxy at the other end.
Right.
I hadn't watched this demo for a while. I've forgotten how much of it features Mario rolling other Marios to their death. It's absolutely baffling, because it's a demonstration of a level shape that will then go on to be the backbone of Mario Galaxy and 128 little critters all running around, which you can sort of see as a proto-pikmin.
So it's kind of like Miyamoto's two interests all at once. But what the Marios actually get up to is mostly killing each other, which I had forgotten. Like Mario's got one, he can jump and he can roll a Mario who's fallen over, and then they just roll the Marios to the edge, and then they just fall into nothing.
Yeah, it's really strange. In this Iwata-Ras, there's quite a lot of talk of people maybe not initially getting it, or getting the idea, or it jumping out like, oh yes, of course, Mario 128, that's the thing we should be building from. And then when you watch this and see how weird it is, yeah, I get that.
If some point of that went, that's going to be the next thing you're working on, I'd be like, oh fucking hell, he's finally lost it.
When you read the Iwata-Ras, he sounds a lot like, he did think with Mario 64 that it's almost a game in itself, just the movement of Mario and an actual game being built around it, wasn't absolutely necessary for it to have fun. So sometimes I do just think he has these static notions of this is the game and the game is just how you move and how you interact with it and not any of the actual game content on top of it.
That stuff smacks to me of that period he went through where he thought Woohoo Island from Wii Fit was going to be the landmass where all Nintendo games could be set because it was so versatile. And you were like, I don't know about this man. As much as the man is an absolute genius, he occasionally says things where I'm like, hmm, I don't know about that.
A Mario 64 that is just Mario in the garden outside Peach's Castle, that's sort of what he's suggesting. Like, he didn't even need a game, we didn't even need to build a game. That is kind of bonkers.
Yeah, I think the reason he thinks that way is that he's such a perfectionist when it comes to the basic movement set and the basics of the game, that he gets that part so right that I think he just sees it as some kind of like pure distillation of what the game experience is. But you're right, you do need an actual computer game on top of it. Perfectly fine for a demo in like, Dixons or something back in the day.
But yeah, I agree. You need slightly more for a full game. So the team that made this, I believe Matthew previously made Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, or at least some members did.
They just started working in the newly created EAD office in Tokyo, which follows some kind of restructure at Nintendo. But I'll be honest, I don't know much about the particular politics of how different teams sort of smushed together back then, and how these teams were built. But it did sound like that not everyone wanted to live in Kyoto and make games there.
And so, in this EAD office, they made the game, and Miyamoto was producer, and he oversaw the project remotely from Kyoto. And what must have been a bit of, if not a first, then one of the first things of its kind. Like he talks about going through these very rudimentary sort of like video calls at the time, and being watched playing games, and how strange it seems.
And that's because video calls were not really the norm back in 2007. So that's interesting.
It's got big future Bath London divide, Tokyo and Kyoto.
A bit further apart though, right?
Whenever they talk about it, it's always because there's been some kind of tension. You know, either they're being managed by someone very powerful, who's in a different city, or I think it's the music team from Mario Galaxy are in Kyoto. They're not actually like in the Tokyo team.
And I think it's mentioned in Iwata Ask that the music team don't get invited to the development rap party, and they just feel really sort of alienated and distant from the whole thing. That's definitely got some Bath London energy.
Yeah, I can sort of see that. It's interesting to hear just a little bit about the politics of that, because I imagine there are no other places you can really read people talking honestly about that sort of thing. But yeah, in Iwata's company, people are quite honest about how they feel about some of this stuff, which is interesting.
So the game was meant to come out within six months of the Wii's launch, which was late 2006, but got delayed. Nintendo had it in their heads that Sunshine, missing the GameCube launch window, was seen as a bit of a failure. Do you think it mattered at the time, Matthew, that the Wii didn't launch with Super Mario Galaxy?
It would have been fun for me working on NGamer to have had that early on. Just, you know, it's always exciting to have a big Mario game. But I don't know if it does suffer for it.
I don't know if it actually makes a huge amount of sense at launch, which was so clearly the Wii Sports show. Now, whether that's just obvious in hindsight, or whether that's something they actually intended to happen, who knows? But I do feel like, you know, Wii Sports is so important in establishing the Wii's identity early on, that I don't know if Mario Galaxy would have muddied the waters a bit, or maybe just been a little bit overlooked, certainly by the audience they were pushing to.
Like, I do think Twilight Princess gets a little lost in the kind of mix of history because of the fact that it comes out at launch, and that isn't the narrative. The narrative is, it's the thing anyone can play with a remote that looks like a TV remote. So maybe Galaxy would have suffered, not a similar fate, obviously Twilight Princess is loved enough, but I don't know that it would have been the star of the show.
Yeah, I think it's a better comparison point to something like, you may disagree with this, but I think it's relative to the Wii, what Ocarina of Time was to the Nintendo 64, you know, where it's like that, it's like a year or two down the line, and then it's like the paradigm shifting, blow your top off kind of game. And that arriving a little bit after launch, I think makes a huge difference. I mean, I know obviously Super Mario 64 was a very well regarded game, but Ocarina of Time immediately went into these best game of all time narratives.
It was just, it was discussed in that way for such a long time. So I don't know, I don't know how you feel about that comparison, but I feel like in some ways it makes sense for it to come along just a year later and be a standout in its own moment, you know?
Yeah, it's weird the Ocarina comparison, because in most Nintendo franchises, and this is a bit of a generalization, but I'm going to stick with it. I feel like there's like the genius breakthrough that gives you a series where it arrives and makes its mark, and then a lot of them have another moment that redesigns them or reinvents them and gives them their second wind. I think Mario Galaxy sort of is that for 3D Mario.
Everything that follows after does stem from them making Mario Galaxy. Everything that's exciting and truly great about 3D Mario sort of is here. You know, in the same way that like Zelda, that moment might be Breath of the Wild, you know?
I don't know, I wonder if this is actually like the earliest major reinvention of a Nintendo series.
Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I suppose that with Ocarina of Time it was still the translating 2D to 3D sort of magic trick.
Maybe there's 3D, yeah. Maybe it's like the 2D game, the 3D game, and then the inevitable 3D reinvention when you need to give it a bit of shot in the arm.
Yeah, I guess, yeah, I could see that. Yeah, so an imperfect comparison maybe, but I agree that Wii Sports kind of was its own big story. I think that just at the time, they didn't know how big a story it was going to be, and so that's why I think the developers were a little bit nervy about missing that window and coming out a year later instead at the end of 2007 as it does.
So because of the spherical worlds, there's quite a lot there to think about in this game when it comes to either where the camera is placed or how Mario's traditional moveset works, and not giving people motion sickness was a big thing for the developers. They thought about this a lot because some members of the team actually did have motion sickness from playing through. In fact, the producer did.
That's what I remember from the auto-arse. The producer did, he had motion sickness from playing Super Mario 64. So it was kind of like a sort of test bed really for, is our game going to give people motion sickness?
And so that's kind of interesting. But it also comes down to things like, in the other games, Mario jumps on Goombas to defeat them. And that's not necessarily going to work when Mario is running across the surface of these spherical worlds.
So they implement this spin move, which is a much better fit for that perspective. Because at that point, it's basically an AOE attack, isn't it? And you're just sort of like spinning into enemies.
And it's fairly easy to keep track of. And that even took a lot of thought. Miyamoto was behind the thinking that the spin should have a time delay between spins.
So you can't just like, you know, spin and spin and spin and spin. That's a crucial part of the dynamic of this game. There's a big element of the combat is you go in, spin, go, oh, I fucked it back away.
Then go in and spin again. And that's a very considered loop. And that's something that Miyamoto is responsible for.
They also created a two player mode. To address any concerns, it might be too difficult for players because they were worried that with the League 2 Mario 64 from the SNES games, that they'd lost a load of players who were getting sort of stuck in certain worlds and not knowing what to do and just feeling a little bit alienated by the additional complications of 3D games. So yeah, I mean, I did want to ask about Miyamoto's contribution here, Matthew, because he identifies that he's better suited to this project as a producer than a director, having that bit of distance.
And you know, it's interesting because some of the certain parts of his reputation get litigated a little bit in the Iwataras as well. So he apparently had a reputation as being someone who, in his usual way of working, would have developers scrambling to implement his ideas at the last minute during development. But here it was a bit of a reverse of that.
So he would encourage developers not to chuck out ideas that didn't work and instead help them to salvage things where they could work. And I was curious what you made of his influence on the game. It's the final interview in the Iwataras series.
But yeah, it seems like he had the right amount of distance from it to me to allow his younger game designers to really show what they could do.
Yeah, I'd agree with that. Just the idea of like he's the ultimate playtester and he's able to sort of come up with fixes, but also understand the exact things that really need to be studied in that kind of detail. People have talked about in various interviews over the years his ability to drill into like maybe one or two actions which he feels actually kind of define the whole experience and he's not really interested in the minutia outside of that.
It's sort of as long as the character's feeling right that'll probably translate into you know whatever you happen to put them through will also work. You know it doesn't feel like he's a guy going you know this level shouldn't have giant eggs in it that's not really his kind of feedback you know it's more about like you save you know the precision of the spin jump and exactly how it should behave there's another bit where they talk about him basically vetoing the idea that Mario's spin should be able to pull coins in to collect them like a vortex. I guess the idea being that you know it sort of over simplifies and doesn't make any of it a risk you know you don't want to automate anything.
There's a really interesting streak to a lot of his thinking and it's really interesting in and around the Mario Galaxy games of being like the champion of accessibility and things making sense and things feeling good and just being naturally fun but not mistaking that for over simplifying and making things easy. I think the phrase that actually jumped out reading it this time, and I've read this interview so many fucking times over the years, but one of the other developers says, or his crucial input is he says, make it easy but intense, which I think really kind of captures the idea that he doesn't just want everyone to go in and have just be handed out rewards. He still wants people to be challenged.
He still wants people to actually play a game. He just doesn't want there to be any kind of bullshit barrier to them being able to do that. And that's quite interesting in the context of 3D Mario, which they talk about in these interviews being difficulty and how to target it and who can actually play these games is one of the great challenges.
And it's something that rolls into Mario Galaxy 2, which we'll get to when we do the Excel episode as well. You know, like, they, you know, spoiler alert in those Iwata Arse interviews, they're not completely content with where Mario Galaxy 1 landed. And they feel like there's more work to be done on that front.
What I find really interesting is I don't know that much about Miyamoto personally. Like, I know him more as mascot and figurehead, I've seen mentioned over the years in various different context and knowing much about how he really thinks about games. And the point that the Iwata Arse makes is that he has this background in industrial design and it seems like he has a fiercely practical brain and a wildly creative one at the same time.
And being able to be both of those people at once is probably what's behind his genius as a game designer. Does that seem right to you?
It's maybe like his ability to apply that creativity and imagination to new visual ideas and to get around design problems. They're always talking about the Koopas being turtles and how they came to the turtle. The idea of we need a thing that you can attack from the bottom where it's soft but if you land on it from the top it has this particular behaviour.
It may be the weird genius of Miyamoto is going well this is a design problem, we want something, we want an enemy that behaves like this but it's my weird brain that makes that jump to turtle and gives us that particular creation and I think that's the thing he's trying to impart to anyone who makes 3D or 2D Mario games is this idea of what in a game can sort of creatively but also logically convey an idea, how do you make this game like super readable and it doesn't matter if you end up going to some quite surreal places as long as it makes sense to him.
Interesting presence to work with, I imagine pretty intimidating. I think even that shines through from the water arts that it's quite nerve-wracking to just sit there and watch him play your build and say this is too easy, this is too hard, this should be doing this, this doesn't quite work and yeah, I bet that was especially remotely just trying to read his expressions. I imagine probably not much fun to make the game with that in mind but yeah.
But I also like that me and Moat is like the benefit of having remote meetings is that I don't have to sit in a room with the person who made it and play their level in front of them and basically be shit at that level because it really stresses me out and you're like, that's good, that's nice. There is that pot side of the game as well. It's like, I might just be bad at this so don't judge me, like who am I to give you all these lectures on how to make games if I can't actually play the damn things.
He also, I thought it was interesting that when he gave feedback, he gave feedback to the entire development team as well. Like he would loop in people who would not necessarily be the people who worked on a very specific bit that he was talking about, but he wanted all of them to have that feedback. Which again, is probably a double edged sword of like useful but also quite intimidating.
Like if I saw Miyamoto's name in my inbox, I think I could just feel the urge to go to the bathroom.
My big regret as a Games Magazine editor was that when I was giving feedback to one freelancer, I didn't CC in everyone who wrote for the magazine so they could see what I was saying.
Yeah, that's, I suppose when you put it like that.
How mortifying would that be?
That's funny.
There's got to be people who are in those meetings who are like, well, this definitely doesn't apply to my work, so I'm feeling pretty good right now.
Yeah, so some of the other stuff that's interesting in these articles is that the, is how the younger members of the team at the time, who are now basically Nintendo veterans two decades later, sort of felt about being this newish studio who I think they originally aspired to make a smaller game, an original game. Apparently Miyamoto was sad that they didn't want to make something with Nintendo characters. That was something that comes up.
Also, Miyamoto pushed them to think bigger, and certainly they obviously did with Mario Galaxy. But it was really interesting to see that as the DS took off, one of the Mario Galaxy team, Futoshi Shirai, who I think was one of the level designers of the game, who designed Planets in the game, noted that he felt left out because they were making a core game and all the successors on the DS were casual games. The Touch Generations games were what was specifically mentioned here.
That was delayed when they took the game to E3 2006 and got a great reception to the first demo of the game. But I thought it was interesting, Matthew, that even Nintendo devs sensed a sea change there. And also, producer Takao Shimazu mentioned in this Iwata-Ras, that he was also uncertain if the Wii would be a success.
And that's when Iwata acknowledges that.
That's a fucking cool thing to tell your boss. To be honest, I didn't even think this was going to work. So that's me.
I'm an idiot, obviously.
Well, the other thing is, I think that some of the left turns of the game, or, you know, wilder ideas, some of the transformations, they just came about from this being a younger development team. It wasn't me and Mota telling them what to do, you know. They came up with a lot of the stuff that they wanted to do.
So, Be Mario was a suggestion by, I thought it was interesting, they specifically say a female employee, and it was sort of dared into existence by the developers. They're like, you sure you want to have Be Mario in here? And then before you know it, they've built entire levels around Be Mario.
I just kind of wanted to hear what you thought about this emerging generation of designers, because they must have all been in their 20s and 30s at the time. Yes, they are now senior devs on the likes of Donkey Kong Bonanza.
I mean, they're like hugely important figures. And that's what I love about these interviews, is you read them and then it's like, this guy who's relatively low on this team is now super important. So the two big names from the junior batch to look out for here, you've got Heishida, who is basically in charge of the general level flow of the games.
You get the feeling that Beneath Kazumi, who is the director, Heishida's probably got the most impact on what Mario Galaxy looks like. He's the one who evangelises the idea that a great idea can come from any member of the team, such as with B. Mario.
And he's basically been in charge of 3D Mario ever since. And as you'll see, as these interviews go on, he's a huge believer in a wall of post-it notes where anyone can contribute an idea. And if the idea is fun enough or catches enough people's attention, they'll put it into a game.
And that really does define every 3D Mario going forwards from Mario Galaxy. They stop being about a handful of massive worlds and just, here's just loads of ideas where a galaxy can just exist for the sake of one star. Yes, there are some more traditional landmasses which you can explore in more detail, but they don't have to be.
If something's a one shot and it's a good enough one shot, then it can go in and you can see that in 3D land, 3D world, Odyssey, maybe less so in Donkey Kong, which Heishida doesn't really have an involvement in. But in all those games, you see it in Mario Wonder, which Heishida is the producer of. That is just obviously his design principle.
We'll just throw loads of stuff at this and the most fun ideas will stick. And that is how I make games. The other figure in this who's quite important is I think it's Motokura, who is the character designer on Mario Galaxy.
So he hasn't designed Mario himself, but is coming up with the creatures. You know, he is co-director of Donkey Kong Bonanza now. I almost wonder if we're going to see two different strands of games coming out.
Is there a Heishida 3D Mario in the works somewhere in this company, which will sort of adhere more to those values? And are we going to see the sort of weirdness and the visual strangeness of a more kind of artist led strand in Donkey Kong Bonanza? Maybe not, maybe it's wrong to guess too much based on a handful of interviews that have happened over the years.
But I think Heishida is, he is the through line on like some of Nintendo's greatest games of the last ten years. And he's so confident in the interview, like he really knows what he thinks. I think he really jumps off the page again, might just be hindsight.
But when I read it, I'm like, oh yeah, you can tell here this guy's going to be important.
Well, this is exactly why you're the right person to make a Mario Galaxy podcast with. Or, you know, informed speculation, I would say that is, you know, that's...
The other thing, there's this like, quite bullish bit where Heishida says, you know, the exciting thing about working on Mario, I think he describes it like he's kind of the brand ambassador for all video games. Like you have to get it right because it just is the most important game. And whether or not you agree with that, whatever.
I love that confidence, you know, that is someone who really knows that he's involved in something like quite important as far as video games go. I don't know. I think that's the kind of person that you do want, you know, making these games.
Yeah, yeah, for sure. I think that all of them saw it as like a huge responsibility and almost like they've been tricked into making the next 3D Mario. Like they didn't know exactly what they do when they set up EAD Tokyo, but then suddenly they realized that the biggest thing was in their hands.
I felt like a little bit of the narrative from reading this, Matthew. So I did want to point out that this is the first Mario game to use an orchestra, and you can definitely tell in the music. I guess I also want to ask if you had any illustrative observations from the Iwata-Ras, Matthew, before we get into the episode.
I felt bad for Mahito Yokota, who spent 3 months on a main theme for Mario Galaxy, that Koji Kondo basically binned off because he didn't think it was good enough.
I think basically Koji Kondo writes the Good Ed Galaxy theme tune, the central theme of Mario Galaxy, and goes, the music should be like this, and then Yokota runs with it. But I think Yokota gets a last laugh because he does write Gusty Garden Galaxy, which is one of the greatest pieces of video game music of all time. I prefer it to anything Koji Kondo has ever written, so I think he wins.
Fair enough. When I got to Gusty Garden Galaxy, I felt like I got the last piece of your personality unlocked in my head. It was like watching The Fableman for Steven Spielberg.
It was like, although this is what Matthew Castle is about, it's like this piece of music in this context, this is the man Matthew Castle. I finally understand. There's a little bit of that to it, Matthew.
To use the parlance of the day, it's like in the seance of Blake Manor when you find the final clue that lets you build a hypothesis about one of the guests in the hotel and you're like, now I get this person. I fully understand why they murdered a man in Belfast. It's like that.
Exactly. It's exactly like that. But the music part of it is interesting.
Like, Yokota gets very hung up on steel drums and that kind of instrument because Mario has a bit of a...
He thinks it should be Latin themed.
Yeah, Latin themed. But what do you think it's like kind of, kind of right? I could sort of see where he was coming from with that.
But basically just got to the point where he was overthinking it and not quite going in the right direction on some things. Really, that was interesting to read about. They also seem very preoccupied with co-star mode, the game's co-op mode, which to me seems like no big deal as part of the game's legacy.
But they talk loads about it, Matthew. Do you have any thoughts on this stuff?
When I re-read these are utter-arse interviews now, and they spend a large amount of time talking about accessibility options and making things like family friendly, I do wonder how much of that is them pushing the fundamental message of the Wii that it's for everyone, versus was this really as important as you've made it seem?
Yeah, I can see that. The corporate goals.
It's probably the only bit of the Mario Galaxy narrative which you can try and tie that game into the touch generations and the kind of casual wave that was happening at Nintendo. They're trying to frame this game as like anyone can play it, as long as you've got someone controlling a second pointer and using it to hold back enemies and assisting a player. It's not a way that I've ever played the game, but then it definitely isn't aimed at me.
They do acknowledge that there's a real sort of separation of church and state when it comes to this stuff. Miyamoto was adamant that the helpfulness of the pointer in the co-op mode didn't copy over to single player. You couldn't just use the pointer to hold back enemies.
They are two very distinct experiences. I think that was the right move. I think they just have to tick that box in everything they do in this era.
And it's for everyone, because... Blah, blah, blah. The secret undercurrent of this is that they've made a game with...
Which has a little bit of bite in places.
Yeah, for sure. They do say that they stacked it that way. Once you get to the end of the game, you're reaching sections that you don't have to complete in order to finish it.
And that's them appealing to the more hardcore players. No doubt we'll talk about some of the end game stuff in this, Matthew, as we get into the second part of the episode.
They say you can do one star a day and complete it over four months.
The other thing I found really funny when talking about the accessibility is that Miyamoto says we've got people of all ages to come in and test it. And you went elderly people over 50, then it goes like dot dot dot, I'm over 50. And it's sort of like this realisation in real time of his own advancing years.
Not that I think being over 50 makes you old per se, but it was just a funny note that he said the word the word elderly was used in this translation. Yeah. So anything else you wanted to note from the author before we move on?
Well, I always say how lucky we are to have it. It could just be a really naff marketing tool, but I think it's genuinely revealing both about, you know, their working practices, but also their personalities and the people. Yeah, I love reading these things.
They are good. They're very good as journalist resources, I imagine as well. For you listening to this podcast, it's probably quite pleasant to have someone read them and explain them to you without you having to go and read them yourself.
Because I would say that there's a very specific kind of reading experience that they give you, which is much closer to sort of being something a journalist would be interested in Nana Punta, if that makes sense.
I just like it when someone drops like an absolute bomb and then it says roaring laughter. If you manage to get the roars of laughter from that room, like that's a tough room, like some of those guys.
Yeah, it did make me think about your parody of the what to ask that we've talked about before in the podcast and some of the hijinks you got into off the back of that. But I can see why it's quite easy to parody from reading a bunch of these now like the laughter is doing a lot of heavy lifting in brackets there. Okay Matthew, let's take a quick break then and we'll come back with how we feel about Super Mario Galaxy now in 2025.
Let's do it. Let's listen to some banging Mario music in the break as well.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, I've completed Super Mario Galaxy for the first time for this episode. Matthew has obviously played the game many times, no loss about it.
How many times have you played through this game before actually, Matthew?
Probably like five.
Wow, that's a lot. That is a lot. I don't, yeah, I can't think of a game in the last couple of decades that I've finished five times.
Probably Metal Gear Solid 3 is the last game I finished that many times.
I played it for, yeah, review, and then straight off to review, and then later on, maybe in the run up to Mario Galaxy 2, and then maybe again on Wii U, and then this Switch version.
So you are an authority on this game, for sure.
Well, not really, because every single time I forget so much of it. There's so much shit in this game, so much stuff happens that you're like, oh, I've forgotten all of this.
So Matthew, I feel like by 2007, the image of what the Wii was going to be was taking shape but not fully formed yet. It could still have been a hardcore console as much as it was a casual console, which is how I described the DS. I think it's threaded that needle really well.
The library is broad but also deep at the same time, which I think is always the litmus test of how successful a console has been, if it can give you both of those things, that mass appeal but also loads of cool deep cuts to go and discover. You had this and Metroid Prime 3 out that Christmas, and Smash Bros Brawl was not long after. But by the end of 2008, when you had Wii Fit becoming the phenomenon it was and Mario Kart Wii, I think it's a battle that they lost.
What do you remember about the perception of the Wii when Mario Galaxy rolled around?
A very skewed version of events because I was writing for the most hardcore corner of the fandom in NGamer and so we just latched on to anything which fed our narrative that it was a place gamers should play. Being slightly sneery about the casual stuff and there was definitely enough going on for the core Nintendo fan if you wanted it. Particularly earlier on, I think third parties were there for it as well.
We could comfortably make a magazine every month, which was a pretty good indication of where things were. It was just so obvious from how games were doing in the chart and which games would pick up and which ones weren't that the Wii was always struggling to get the new audience it created to buy anything that wasn't Wii Sports, Wii Fit or Mario Kart. Not exclusively the success story of the Wii, but kind of close to.
But then we kind of put our fingers in our ears a little bit and pushed on. So as far as I was concerned, it was a place you could play court games and be happy, but I obviously know that isn't entirely the truth.
I personally think Super Mario Galaxy reflects the creative intent of the Wii, but not the reality of it in hindsight. I think you even get a bit of this from the Iwata-Ras, of how they see what Mario Galaxy is matching up with what the Wii was supposed to be. And no other classic Nintendo series has a moment on Wii that's nearly as revolutionary in a good way, wildly inventive or as accomplished as this.
Why do you think that is? Why does that only happen for Mario on Wii this generation? And am I right in saying that?
I can't think of anything else that nails it to this degree. I'd say it's an extension of my theory, which I didn't brilliantly explain earlier, that it kind of had to happen as well, after like Mario Sunshine and then some time away to make Jungle Beat. I just wonder if Mario was at a point where this had to happen in the same way that Breath of the Wild was at the point after Skyward Sword where that kind of had to happen.
There's maybe an undercurrent of that in some of the interviews, in terms of recognising that there is something that's stopping 3D Mario from becoming a truly massive seller. There is something that scares people off. There are people who pick up Mario 64 and go, this whole genre isn't for me.
And Galaxy is an attempt to sort of try and fix that and answer that question of like, why is that? What's happening here? Maybe that is the kind of the big revolutionary question that has to be asked in the same way that they ask themselves, how do we get away from just making Ocarina over and over again with Zelda?
And you almost need to ask yourself that hard question. So it's whether or not that comes about just by chance, or they feel like it's now or never for 3D Mario, but I don't think it was as desperate as that.
Well, no, I think the other maybe a bit of context is missing. Hinting out around the edges in the Iwata Ross interview is that, at this point, new Super Mario Bros. has come out on DS and been a monster success.
So there's absolutely no doubt in anyone's mind that Mario as a franchise is a huge commercial draw. But at the same time, they do acknowledge that 3D Mario is like a separate track to any other kind of Mario. It is its own beast, and they certainly talk about it that way, and they've obviously treated it that way over the years.
And yeah, you might be right. It's maybe it's just having that, maybe just hitting a bit of a, you know, a sort of like a not totally knocking out the park moment with Mario Sunshine just means that they're asked, they're forced to ask that question a bit earlier than the Zelda developers are. So yeah, that could be a big part of it.
Jungle Beat is such a different game, you know, which is basically the core of the Galaxy team make Jungle Beat before Mario Galaxy, which is the 2D Donkey Kong platformer that you control with bongo drums. Sort of almost like an auto running platformer really, because it's all about forward momentum and timing your claps and beats to jump over sort of obstacles as big things charge after you. And that is such a departure from Mario Sunshine, but in itself is an attempt for them to go, well, if people can't get their head around playing 3D action games in full 3D with a camera, what happens if we go 2D and take away camera control?
What happens if we play in that space? Have we got something new to say there? It seems to be a bit of an obsession of Kazumi's, and then he's like, well, that wasn't quite necessarily what we were after or hasn't had the impact we wanted, so we take a second go at it, and this time it's Mario Galaxy.
Like you said earlier, they were maybe pitching to do an original character or an original game, not something that had ever been done before, but you wonder if there is a desire to try something new. There's a dissatisfaction at the heart of that team. Maybe that is the seed of great Nintendo games.
You get it a little bit later when you get to the Wii U and the 3DS generation, there's so much talk of certain franchises almost being on their last roll of the dice and then they absolutely blow out of the water and then those things are completely reborn and go on to be huge franchises. Fire Emblem is the obvious case there. Maybe that is the narrative of the last 20 years of Nintendo.
Things get a little bit stale and then you really have to pull it out of the hat at the last minute. Maybe not. I don't know if that's truly my grand unifying theory of Nintendo.
It's just interesting that for Mario Galaxy that moment happened on the Wii, because like I say, it's the only series where it does happen. In my head, I was thinking when I came into playing this, I was like, how much of the DNA of the Wii is in Mario Galaxy, actually, because in my head, I was thinking, well, I know obviously that the spinning and flying through the stars, that was always like a Wii motion thing and firing the little star bits. But I think it truly is like a Wii game in its DNA, and it was so rare to see true greatness using the Wii's interface, that it just feels like such a one-off looking back.
I'm not saying that they didn't do great things with that hardware, but I mean truly top of the class, the best games of all time, the Wii just did not produce that many of them, and arguably only produced two of these two games. And I just think that's really interesting, because most other Nintendo hardware have like two to three all-timers out of them, and they're from different series, you know, like different series will have different peaks at different times for sure, but I don't know, like these two games are just so radical and different from anything else that happened on that console. It's just, yeah, it's quite a, yeah, they just stand apart, I think, in this really specific way.
So Matthew, let's each talk about our first touch points with this game. Take us back once again to the TV stayed with Yoghurt in the future office.
I think this was actually pre-Yoghurt Vision. That was a later TV. The Yoghurt covered TV, believe it or not, was an upgrade to the TV we had when we played Mario Galaxy, which was just a proper, yeah, bog standard CRT, much smaller, but no Yoghurt.
Covering Mario Galaxy was hugely important to me. Like, it's my first year on the job working under Greener, and I felt like Mario Galaxy brought out the best in us in a magazine. It saw Mahito Greener, Mark Green, like, at his most excited.
And I feel like through that game is where I learnt my approach to how we were going to cover games and how I'd continue covering games, you know, long after that. Just being absolutely obsessed with it, going all in on it, trying to squeeze every drop of like every screenshot trailer demo. You know, we didn't go to E3 that year, but we basically harvested every video that everyone had taken and tried to create like the most comprehensive coverage of this game around.
You know, I remember writing ridiculous features about, you know, 20 things we just learned from this trailer and, you know, in which I incorrectly predicted Wario was going to be the big bad guy of Galaxy because there was an enemy that had pink and yellow eyes, which I thought was the Wario Colors set. Mad things like that, but it didn't matter it was wrong because it was just the work of like a lunatic obsession, which is I think exactly what any Nintendo fan probably would have felt towards Mario Galaxy at the time. You know, we went to play at Windsor as a team.
I think they had the E3 demo like a month later and the whole team went to Windsor, like art editors and all. We all went, all six of us, just to see it and so we could talk about it and cover it in the magazine. I remember we were kicking ourselves because when we did our E3 coverage, we'd drawn these beautiful diagrams of the levels, which we'd kind of reverse engineered from watching everyone else's footage and then going there and seeing like the Honey Hive Galaxy for the first time and realizing that we'd gotten, you know, all these details wrong or like, oh, that platform is actually on the other side.
We just didn't quite understand it from the perspective of the video and all this stuff. Like, I just, I love that time. I just felt we were like all in on it.
And, you know, what a game to be all in on. And then finally getting to review it. And just three of the best days of playing a game, which no one had seen, you know, there was no review of it.
I was sitting by myself in the room. I couldn't even have it spoiled by someone sitting next to me playing levels I hadn't gotten to yet. You know, it was just all new.
You know, the PRs occasionally sticking their head in the room, not wanting to see it for themselves, you know, because they didn't want to spoil it. And having those moments where you see something, where you're like, well, that's probably like the best bit of video game I've ever played at this given moment in time. And, you know, wanting to share it with someone and like looking around that room.
I just kept turning to people who weren't there, as if to be like, look at this, whoa, this is crazy. You know, you always wanted someone else to see it, just to say, oh, yeah, you did see that. That was, that's true.
You know, you wanted a witness, you know, to it. I can't run the state. It's like, you know, the greatest thing I ever got to cover in games journalism and got to cover it in like the most fun way possible.
So, you know, it's just the formative game for me.
Yeah, it's a shame that we'll never, the world will never be the same shape again, where you can, you know, cover a game in that fashion and follow a game in that fashion. It's just, you know, it's so, it's so different now. Everything's so instantaneous.
Yeah.
The only thing that's, the only thing that's sort of, that's confounding about the whole thing is when you have to read about an Animal Crossing upgrade on the Nintendo Today app because they haven't put it on their own website. And that's, that's just classic Nintendo. You know, that's, that's one way in which it does represent the past a little bit, but yeah.
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's kind of why I wanted to do this game, really, Matthew, because the Switch 2, sorry, the Switch re-release gave us an excuse to do so. And I know it means a lot to you. And I remember you telling those stories before about, you know, trying to sort of map what the game was just based on the bits and pieces that were out there and what a cool experience that was.
I don't really have anything that quite compares to it. Something like GTA 4 is probably my closest I've got to it, or like Metal Gear Solid 4, maybe. But I came along when those, those games were, I don't know, that was, it was a similar timeframe, but it was, yeah, I don't know.
I think the specific Nintendo-ness of it is maybe what adds to the magic there. And the fact that it is this, this game that was truly revolutionary, it wasn't just a step up, it was something that hadn't been done before. So, my first touch point with it, Matthew, somehow, even though I made like 12 grand a year in Bournemouth, like no money at all, I managed to buy all three consoles in my first nine months of working at Magic.
You make it work, you have to make it work when you earn underpaid stuff, right?
You do. When you're into games, I find, and even if you have like no income, you know, assuming you don't have children or responsibilities, and I definitely didn't at the time, you just find a way to somehow your finances fit around it. I probably did a load of freelance, you know, I probably did something like three to four hundred pounds of freelance a month just to top up my salary.
And I remember I got to, I bought a PS3 and I bought a 360 and then I got to the end of the year and I was at HMV in Gunworth. And it was something like the Wii and Mario Galaxy for, I think it was for 200 pounds. I think that's right.
And it was like a bundle. It was, yeah, those games, that game, and then some shite peripherals they chucked in as well that went straight in the bin, they did. Some kind of plastic nonsense to put the Wii remote in.
I don't really remember the details of that. But I bought it because I just thought, you know what, it's just, I've heard amazing things about this game, and I really want to check it out. I was like big into my DS, and I'd never owned a Nintendo home console while the thing had games being released for it.
It's the first time I ever did that, and I thought that'd be an exciting thing to do. And I played through, I got through three of the different areas in the game. I got to the kitchen, I think I got to Matthew, then for whatever reason stopped.
I just never played the Wii that much. Even this game, this beautiful game, looked like ass on my HDTV. It just didn't quite look as good as it should.
And in my head I was like, oh, it just sucks that you can put something like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare on, and that looks like a million bucks. And Mario Galaxy, which is objectively a more beautiful game in terms of art direction, somehow just looks worse, because it's all coming through a very shit third party component cable. That was a bummer.
And I only ever finished one game on Wii, and that was No More Heroes. I didn't finish any other games on Wii. So this is really the first time I've played through it properly.
That's good. I was going to say, do you remember, did it have a big impact on the Bournemouth office? Was there ripples of excitement?
Were there enough Nintendo fans there for that to happen?
I don't think there were. I think, so in my head, it's Ashley Day, obviously, he was kind of like the center of Nintendo activity in the office. And definitely Darren on Retro Gamer talked this up and followed Nintendo very closely.
And I think actually, I think Games TM, I think maybe Rick, the editor, was into it as well. And there was also, I think John Denton maybe got into it. I might be misremembering there.
But there was definitely also a contingent of people who just were not interested in what Nintendo were doing and didn't play it, didn't talk about it. It definitely didn't feel like it, you know, this came out at the same time as The Orange Box or Bioshock or Halo 3. And those games took over the office in the way that this game did not.
And yeah, it just wasn't a Nintendo loving office.
It didn't have room in your hearts for true magic.
No, only the brown shooter magic provided by the likes of Resistance 4.
The people who played it really loved it, but it was always like this in Nintendo games. Now, I think that gradually shifted a bit over time, and then a few more Nintendo fans filtered in. Maybe because the Wii and the DS were so successful, I don't know.
But yeah, to be honest, the PS3 had a similar response from people. Uncharted was a game that was like a viral success. It took a while for people to play that around the office and say that game was good.
It was very steady going. 360 was just so dominant. I can't tell you what a stranglehold they had on the consciousness of the media in the late noughties.
Truly the only thing Mario Galaxy has in common with Lair. It's the handshake meme, both underappreciated by 360 loving galoops.
I suppose then let's ask the big question Matthew. What do you think holds up well about Super Mario Galaxy now? I wondered if we could start by me offering a big take on how I found the experience to kind of kick us off.
I would love to hear your big take. I'm apprehensive about this, but I'm, you know, I want you to say now, like could end the podcast, which I guess is quite exciting.
Yeah, so no, I think this is a wonderful game, incredibly inventive. And I think that the chances it takes mean that it has higher highs than any other Mario game, but also lower lows than quite a lot of other Mario games as well. And what I mean by that is that some things are just a little bit unvarnished in terms of like, I'm not a big Mario transformations guy.
I'm going to just set that up now. I don't think anytime one of those happened in, while I was playing this game, I thought, I am now playing a worse version of this game. Like the Mario moveset in Mario Galaxy is perfect.
And then when something like that would happen, or the camera would do something particular where I didn't quite have the information I needed to see where Mario was going to land after I did something, or I didn't understand why I got sucked into a gravity field when I was clearly trying to go somewhere else. Things like that would occasionally happen where I was like, nothing this annoying happens in Super Mario 3D World, for example, which is a game obviously I like a lot. But at its highest highs, this is as good as platforming games get, especially in terms of imagination and visuals.
Like it's a game where I felt like I needed to see, I've not seen every single galaxy in this game, but I've seen most of them. And that is because I just wanted to see what was in this vast selection box they built. It's just the way that an idea would turn into a whole world and the way that its secrets would be peeled back.
It's pretty amazing stuff. So I think this largely lives up to its reputation and then just simply has some of the sort of scarring that almost two decades do to any game. Like all the games we've discussed, they've all got the Orange Box, Bioshock, Uncharted.
Those games are all dated in different ways. And this game, I think, is less dated than all of those. I think it still plays really, really well.
It's just that it reaches so far. And I think the only time to ever fall short is when it's maybe trying to do something that's not as polished as like something else the game does.
You know what? I will take that. I'll take that as an assessment of this game.
It's not a million miles off like how I feel about it. So that's okay. When we talk about things we're not as into, I do think the transformations are a weak part of this game.
There are a couple I'm quite fond of. They're probably not ones that everyone is fond of. But I think generally they're quite weak, but we can get to those in a bit.
Yeah, okay. That sounds good. So yeah, I mean, that really is my top line on what holds up so well.
It's the variety and how accomplished it is despite that variety. But I'd love to hear what you think holds up well about it now.
You know, boringly, I always return to the same things. I do think the space spare setting gives them this incredible freedom that, you know, it doesn't have to answer to any particular kind of logic, whether that's galaxy to galaxy, the variety of places you go, but even within galaxy, planetoid to planetoid. The fact that this is basically a load of sort of self-contained challenges that are joined by these sort of arcing flights when you shoot out of these warp stars.
I mean, it really means that they can build out of anything, and some of them are quite coherent. You know, like all of this level is all sort of slightly militaristic in flavour or whatever, but some of the other ones, you know, you jump from like a big bean to an apple to like a weird wooden toy box in the sky. You know, it's kind of like whatever's fun.
There doesn't have to be a kind of visual coherence to this, and I think that unlocks the Heyashida effect of anything goes if it's fun. Which is just the crucial idea, I think, for this and 3D Marries going forward. I still love the way this controls.
I think it is just very fun to move in this world, mess around with the gravity to sort of fuck around. I think there are bits of the game which are meant to be quite difficult and I think there are bits of game which are just meant to be a big toy that you can mess around in. That thing Miyamoto talked about of like, why can't Mario 64 just be movement?
And I think this game comes closest to, you know, it can just be movement probably of any Mario for me. Odyssey is pretty close though. I think the hat's a little bit more complicated than what's going on here.
I think the long jump in Mario Galaxy is probably my favourite move in any video game. Like individual move. I think the way it renders it, the sense of him sort of tightening up and then launching himself, I really feel like that is a guy who's fucking hurling himself over a gap.
Can I ask, what is the long jump? Because I don't know that after finishing this game that I can identify what it is or do it properly if I do.
Long jump is as you're running you crouch and then press jump while you've still got a bit of momentum in the crouch so it feels like he's sort of springing, he's sort of like coiling up and then he kind of hurls himself forward.
Can you run in this game? I thought he just had one speed in this game.
I mean when you're moving forward. If you crouch and press jump you'll do a backflip. If you need some momentum, a crouch and a jump.
I think the thing about the long jump is there are very few moments where you actually have to do one. All the levels are designed that there's often a route which doesn't involve doing a long jump, maybe because they consider that an advanced technique for their beloved casual audience. But there are some of the later challenge levels, when you get into the purple coin challenges that unlock at the end.
There are some purple coins positioned in arcs which are just the shape of a long jump. So you have to do this one beautiful jump through them and you collect all these coins at once. That to me is just heaven, you know?
I get to do this jump and there's such purpose to it. I love it. I just think it's great.
Long jumping off the side of things to see what kind of gravitational arc or orbit Mario goes into, that will always work for me. So the variety of the levels, the feel of the thing, and I just think that the look of the thing obviously, but the sound of it, I just think the music is so good. It does so much heavy lifting where you're like, I'm having a great time.
This is so exciting, but it's actually just a really exciting piece of music. When you land in those galaxies and then a big piece of music kicks off, or when you have a quiet piece of music which then kicks off when you get to the next bit of the level, I just feel like it's a big push from Nintendo of like, go on, off you go, have fun. Which I just really respond to, and it gets me every time.
If I leave it a couple of years between these playthroughs, I forget enough of it that I'm like, oh yeah, I've forgotten all this awesome stuff, and I will always like the feel and sound of it. So I was kind of wavering on whether or not... I hadn't played it for a while, and it wasn't that I was beginning to question whether it was good, but I was like, is this actually my favourite game of all time?
Or do I maybe like Odyssey more now? Or do I like this or whatever? But playing this I was like, yeah, this has still got it.
I still think this and Galaxy 2 are like the best 3D Mario games for me.
Yes, it's interesting because I was there thinking, this is a weird thought experiment, but I was there thinking, if you took out all the Mario elements in this game and had the same game, you had to replace it with different characters, this game would seem so wild and strange and like, what the hell is this? This game, this sci-fi game, set on all of these little micro worlds, all these strange shapes with all this weird use of gravity, and all these kind of completely bizarre ideas. I think it would, I always think that the Mario element of it, obfuscates just what an achievement that is in your head, because you think, oh yeah, it's Mario, he goes to all these wacky places and that's what he does.
But he didn't do anything like this beforehand. He went to places that were like the fiery place or the beach place, or places that were grounded and then this was a deliberate escalation. And I think it's exemplified by the fact that you can look in the, you know, the two decades since this game came out, look back and go, which other games managed to really do anything like this, or, you know, try to do anything like this.
And it truly just, you know, I think me and Mahito even talked about it as, you know, I wanted to do this, these styles, style of worlds, this type of gameplay before anyone else did it. And they did it, were the best at it, and then no one else went really near it. Like I would like the Grow Home and Grow Up games to be like the closest there is to something in Mario Galaxy's mold, Matthew.
They're kind of like their own sub-genre within the Mario games in a way.
Yeah, yeah, definitely the sort of little planet. I'd say Grow Home is very Gusty Garden coded. Yeah.
I would. I just I see apples in Tesco's and I'm like, that's very Gusty Garden coded. Or a broad bean in a restaurant.
Yeah. It's just such an absurdly inventive game. And I think it's just easy to just kind of write it off in your head as like, oh yeah, but that's kind of what Mario does.
But if you actually haven't encountered most of this stuff fresh and I hadn't, it's just like one of the most visually extraordinary games ever made. Like if you take any screenshot from any world in this game, you'll be, I think like it's got to be among, surely a hundred times out of a hundred people would identify this as Mario Galaxy. And you know, you couldn't say, how many games could you say that about truly?
Like the image of like a pretty simple in sort of like technical detail, but like distinctive bit of geometry floating in space and shaped in that particular way. Like there's such a, yeah, I don't know. It's so distinctive, the visual style of this game.
I think that's really impressive considering they're basically made it on a souped up GameCube. You know, that's quite an achievement really. So yeah, that's, I just want to emphasize like just how the iconography of this game is just an unbelievable achievement.
It's really just something else.
I was interested how that stuff would land playing it for the first time, particularly like post Astro Bot, because that's more Mario Galaxy than it is anything else. Just in terms of like, here's a load of random stuff. I'd say that the worlds in Astro Bot, while there's a lot of variety between them, I think once you're in them they're quite locked in to like an idea, which maybe feels a bit more traditionally video game-y.
Like this is a tree level, and this is a desert level, and this is the lava level. I don't know, did you sort of think about Astro Bot at all while playing this?
I thought about Astro Bot two times. One I thought, what is the best level, I asked myself what is the best level in Astro Bot, and how does it compare to the best level in this game. And the best level in Astro Bot is that casino level.
It's brilliant. It's as good as you could ever want from a casino level. It does everything with the time powers that you want from it.
And then I thought, how many other levels does it have along those, you know, to the same standard? And I would say that in that particular league, you've probably only got three or four in the whole game that are really in that top, top tier level. I think Mario Galaxy has got about 20 levels like that.
That's a take I like.
However, I will also say, let's just stop there.
Next question.
There is a single note at the bottom of my Google Doc when I was playing it that says, Spring Mario is worse than anything Astro Bot ever did.
That is not right. I think Spring Mario is one of the two good transformations in this.
Okay, let me ask you a question. Why does Spring Mario not always jump when you hit the jump button, Matthew? Like, what the fuck?
You have to time it when he coils.
I'm sorry, that does not work to any accurate degree. There are times where it's just like, nah, not today. And then it just stops fucking working.
I swear to God.
You are pressing it too early or too late.
I'm telling you, man. Astro Bot may be like mid in places for you, but I'm telling you it never does anything that annoying. And I'm even including those fucking trial levels at the end.
Are you really telling me you'd rather do the level where you have to squeeze a duck or something to put out lava than play with the majestic Spring Mario, a character who's cursed to jump, as they say in the water arse?
That was a great bit of that interview, for sure. But Matter Splatter Galaxy, the second half of it, when it stops being the...
Oh, that's the bit where you have to climb up.
Yes. That's the worst thing ever, my friend. Tell me that that particular level with Spring Mario is worse than anything in Astro Bot for sure.
I am certain of that. Not the first half of the level, when the little bits are bouncing around, and I was like, did they come up with Splatoon when they were doing this level?
That's genius, that level.
I'm sorry, that first half, that first half is, but that second half isn't really related to the rest of the level.
To take that thing, go, say, we've got this mechanic where this level only manifests in tiny little splotches, the land, the ground is going to constantly move, and then we've got a character who also has to constantly move and take these crazy long jumps. And wouldn't the craziest thing be if that spring turned up at the same time that the matter splatter turned up? That's godly game design.
I would say it's godly game design on paper, but when you play it, it's devilish design, my friend.
You can see it. Hatersheet is sitting there and he looks up at old Shimizu and says, you know this matter splatter galaxy, you know it would be real fucking crazy if he turned up right now in this moment. And they both look and go, Spring Mario, and he's like, yeah, that's right.
Now I understand how you mythologize the development of Nintendo's games in your head and how it's basically a form of fan fiction.
He says, you know, I'm thinking, he's like, you wouldn't. He says, I fucking would.
Well, I like enjoying the very British energy of the way you imagine these developers interacting with Matthew.
That's exactly how it happens.
I'm telling you, Miyamoto, in one of those meetings, never played Matter Splatter Galaxy second half successfully, in front of all those people watching him on a video call.
Oh, certainly not in a room with them watching. He's like, guys, I think we've run out of time for the meeting. I've got another call coming through.
So I'm just going to take this build away and I'll come back in a year, say.
So I need you all to leave the room while I scream at this second half of this level.
That's why it didn't make launch. It was going to make launch, but it just took Miyamoto nine months before he could complete Matter Splatter and he's too proud to say anything.
Oh dear. But that's what I mean about high highs and low lows. I think that by having this sort of like crazier canvas, it just inevitably will have some parts of the game that don't function as well as others.
Plus they made it in two and a half years, right? Which is crazy when you think about it. There's just so much to this game.
I suppose, Matthew, we probably should use that as a springboard to talk about what works less well. Clearly, Spring Mario, I have a problem with. And I didn't mind him the first time he turned up because it didn't matter so much that when I pressed the A or B button, that Mario would actually jump when I told him to.
And then it did matter when I got to Matterspatter Galaxy and the penalty for failure was immediate death and starting that section again. And it was the only level where I went, nope, and then just left it and went back to the observatory. I was like, nope, I don't think so.
So I wish you well, Nintendo. But with that in mind, what works less well in this game now?
I don't think the end game of Mario Galaxy is quite as exciting as what they've done in the games since Mario Galaxy. The way it works for people who haven't got deep into Mario Galaxy is there comes a point where you've actually done, I would say, all the original stars in the galaxies and they start introducing comets, which hover over a galaxy and remix one of the stars. They can make levels move faster, so it's the same challenge, but twice the speed.
There can be some way you're racing against a little cosmic Mario. There's some way you have to do a boss fight, but now you've only got one hit point instead of three hit points. Once you've completed the game, you get the purple comet, which adds these purple coin challenges, where you have to collect a hundred purple coins, sometimes under very stiff time limits, sometimes they just put the coins in really dangerous places to fuck you up.
And it's fine as a suite of difficult modes of existing galaxies, but for me I feel like this game is feeding you new galaxy after new galaxy, basically all up in the run to the last boss, and you think this game's never gonna stop, then suddenly it does kind of stop, and I still like them, I still think they're good challenges, but it's not quite as magic as there being like another couple of worlds after the end credits, or a really big surprise hidden like that, and I always find the last third of this game a little bit more of a slog because of that.
Yeah, so when you say last third, then you're meaning basically the very last bit of the game and the end game, or just the end game.
I'd say by the time you're collecting the last 40 stars in this, you've seen like every level, and it's a case of like nasty things happening in previous levels. There's also like, it has this weird mechanic where the comets appear semi-randomly, so you don't necessarily have a choice over which one to do. You can pay a little loomer, you can feed it some stuff, and it will move the comets for you.
But at that point, you're like, I just want to mop up these things. You know, if it's given me one that I'm really stuck on, I don't really want to have to go and do this whole process to get rid of it. I just, you know, just let me do all 40 of them in any order.
Like that's the kind of mood I'm in for really difficult challenges. Because I'd say amongst those comets, there are, I'd say there are like five to ten absolute motherfuckers. And if it's serving those up, you just don't want to do them ever.
Like some of the bosses with one hit, a boss which is actually incredibly easy on paper, it just nobbles you, you know, like one hit is tough, you know? It's the tiniest mistake and you're like, oh, I've got to go back to the start. Doing Boulder Geist, the boss of the ghostly galaxy with one hit point, where it's got so many ways it can clip you, that's a huge pain in the ass.
Fuck that guy. That was one attempt to turn that off straight away.
Right.
Rubbish.
Yeah. That's what the end game of that is. It's just, I don't know, it's not quite as inventive as the rest of it, but I guess they have to stop at a certain point and go, well, we can't keep inventing more galaxies for you.
But that bugged me the very first time I played it and it always comes back to it. I'm like, I'm not as into this final run.
Yeah. I think the way that Mario 3D World would gate its end game content is better than the way they do it here. It is a bit like they overextend the amount of content they've built for this.
You say the last 40 stars are a slog. I agree. I got to 83, 84, and I was like, you know what, that's a good amount.
I've not seen every bit of content in this game. There were a couple of galaxies I liked the look of on the Mario Wiki where I was like, ah, it's a shame I didn't see that. But also I thought, I've got Mario Galaxy 2.
So I'm just going to go and play that instead, I think. And that's fine. So I agree with that.
Anything else that you would say holds up less well?
This is less of a problem, but more of a shift in philosophy. I think Galaxy does mark the moment that Mario becomes less interested in weirdo secrets around the edges. Everything you hear is designed to be found pretty easily, and it all feels quite inevitable.
Apart from the difficulty of it, there's nothing really halting you getting to 120 stars. And they definitely fix that in the Mario Galaxy 2's end game, which we can cover when we get to that. They have a better idea of how to make you think around the levels a little bit more.
But I do miss the hunt for the secret exits in 2D Mario games of old. Staring at the sun in Mario 64 to get to a hidden level. All kinds of weird shit around the edges in Mario Sunshine.
I don't feel like there's anything here that you can whisper about in the playground. There's no rumours to be had. It's quite straightforward.
And that isn't a huge ding against it. And that never ever returns. You know, Mario is just a little bit more normal and well behaved for the rest of its life.
And it begins here, if that makes sense?
Yeah, that makes total sense. I think it was interesting to see in the Iwata-Rastat. I think Iwata says part of the essence of Mario is that, you know, one out of ten times the player goes left, goes back for something in a level, they'll find a secret.
And yeah, I don't think you can really say this game does. Because on the one time I stumbled across a green star, I was like, oh, that was cool. But I was quite surprised to learn how few moments there were like that in the game.
And where the sort of like, within levels, you could find another way to get a star or unlock a different, yeah, basically go down a different track. It was pretty obvious where those bits were.
It's like they picked seven levels and went, although seven can have secret stars, but not the rest of them. And as a result, you never really go hunting for them. You know, there's never a sense of like, oh, I wonder if there is something, you know, behind this or I want, you know, you just don't enter these levels thinking, I wonder.
They just always they sort of lay out what's brilliant about themselves in such like an open and honest way, which is why the game feels so sensational to play. But with it, something is definitely lost.
That's I think that's a that's a fair take. So nothing else, Matthew, nothing else.
And I have noted that not all transformations are made equal.
Let's get into the transformations here then. I think that might be a fun place to go next. So yeah, I mean, it's a clear starting point for what Odyssey becomes as we kind of noted.
And yeah, I don't I didn't personally get on with them. I think B1 is like a worse version of the Tanooki sort of power. I don't really know how that is like notably different really from from what that does.
It's allergic to water.
That is true. It's just worse. The one level where you have to use it climbing up that big sticky wall, I thought was a bad level because the camera was in a particularly bad place.
And so you were relying on the position of the shadow, but it still wasn't quite dependable enough for me to not fuck it up sometimes. So it was a pass from me dog on that. I think using the ice power to kind of like glide over water and leave ice in your wake looks beautiful.
This implementation in some quite tight platforming challenges made me think, even though I think by default that's probably the best power in the game, best transformation in the game, I just didn't think that quite worked.
Here's the case against the fire and ice flower. They're all like, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip. Awful music plays during them.
There was that level, Fire and Ice, whatever that level was called.
Freeze Flame.
That is it, where I swore so many times at the game during that level, it was kind of unbelievable. I was just like, when I got to the end of it, I was like, I can never play that again. It's just not good for my blood pressure.
You go into that level scoffing at Princess Peach, sending you five 1-ups in a letter. It's the point where you're like, ah, fuck the post toad, I don't need it, pal. And then you're like, post toad, where are you?
Come to Freeze Flame Galaxy, I need you right now.
Fuck the post toad is a great phrase, by the way. That's going to be stuck in my head for a little while there. And so, yeah, I mean, obviously, Spring Mario we've talked about, and I mean, the others don't really, are there others that I'm forgetting?
I don't mind Bee Mario, I like Spring Mario. Yeah. I think Boo Mario just doesn't have anything to do.
It's a very, it's very tepid stealth, really. That's all Boo Mario really is.
It is, and just like the, he's allergic to light.
That one level where you race the boo as a boo is pretty good. That's, it's tricky, but like, it does require you to master that own particular set of mechanics. But it's kind of a mini game rather than like a meaningful change to the base game.
Do you like the level where you get to choose whether you want to do it as a bee or a boo, aka the immersive sim level?
It's basically barrel down this fucking tunnel of bullshit as quickly as you can that level, isn't it? That's kind of what it ends up being. I think I did pick the boo in that situation.
Yeah, that's correct. That's the right one to pick.
There's no flying-related peril to the boo, so it's just dodging some spotlights. You're right though, Matthew, this game is an immersive sim. We should ask Jeremy Peel what his take on that is.
What about… so they're not quite transformations. How do you feel about rolling on a ball with motion controls or steering a bubble with a pointer air gust?
Because I kind of count, you know, there's such departures from Mario's traditional moveset that they sort of fit this category.
Are there more than two levels that do this? Like, it's not many, right?
I think there's three a piece.
Right, okay. I mean, it's sort of like… the one that stuck in my brain was the very last one that I just did yesterday, which was in Melty Molten Galaxy, where you got this basically…
You get to the end of the level, I think it is, and there's just this sort of like big cylindrical sort of thing of lava with all these holes in it, and you have to like, barrel across it as quickly as possible.
What I love about that is like, as you fly towards it, you're like, oh god, that looks really bad, that giant tunnel of lava, and then your eye will then catch the ball waiting for you, and you're like, oh god, I've got to do it on the ball.
I was, when I reached that point last night, I was, it was a proper moment of like, it's over, dog, like, it's the ultimate despair basically. I really would have appreciated it if they had reminded me that you can jump using the ball in that level, because it doesn't remind you of that, and so I was treating it like, well, I'm stuck to the ground, how am I going to get through it? Then I got to the very last bit where you do have to hop on to these little moving platforms, and I was like, how do I do this?
And then read a guide that was like, yeah, you can jump in this. And I was like, so I've been basically adhering to a rule set that's not even the rules to try and finish this, i.e. never leaving the ground and perfectly like navigating over these surfaces, not realizing I could jump over the fucking holes in the big lava cylinder.
Still though, it's awesome that it goes, do do do do, do do do.
Well, let me tell you, I was so angry at it, I muted my telly so I didn't even have to hear that sound coming out of it. I was like, not now, Koji Kondo, it's just not the time for this. So yes, it was...
What I love about that ball though is the music goes faster, the quicker you roll, it feels like a reward for doing it all in one smooth move, as you get to hear the tune play out as it's meant to. Otherwise, it's this really timid, do do do do, do do do. So it's like a reward for having some balls.
Yeah, I guess it is. I would say in general that there's a particular cluster of levels in the Garden, which is the last bit you unlock of the Comet Observatory, and all those levels in there are like the designers not really giving a shit about your grandma trying to play this game or whatever. And it's like the full fat Mario Galaxy experience.
And yes, with the particular case of Spring Mario, I didn't like it so much, but the rest of that level I thought was very impressive. Deep Dark Galaxy in that bit is really impressive. Dreadnought Galaxy I really like as well.
I'm spoiling our Best Galaxies bit here, Matthew. But, and then Melty Molten Galaxy, as much as I think it's kind of, I still don't think it's obviously like, it reaches the same high standards as the regular Mario movement. But it was the scale of that last motion control ball challenge.
I was like, you gotta hand it to them. Like they've really commit to it. It's like we're doing the most elaborate possible version, like visually and in terms of gameplay of what you could possibly do with this.
And it's the fact that the designers take these ideas to their logical conclusion, where I'm sort of there thinking, that's fucking impressive, man. Like I really admire that, even when I'm swearing at my telly constantly, you know?
It comes out more when he's talking about 3D land and 3D world, but I'm pretty sure it's Heishida has this theory of like three act structure, which I think I've mentioned before on the podcast, where he's like a great Mario level. He should kind of like introduce and tutorialise an idea in like the first third, then the second third ramps up, and then the third, you know, the last act is what like takes you kind of beyond the concept. I always actually felt like he never did it better than in Mario Galaxy.
Just because you have those reveals of flying between planetoids, they can literally pull back the curtain on something amazing for the final stretch, and hide it from you just because of how the camera works. It's so well done, those moments where you're like, what is that? And knowing that you're going to have to deal with whatever it is.
I just think that's a real magic thing. It's so much better than the fucking every level is just going to end in a flagpole. Like the second you get to those steps up to the flagpole in 3D land or world, you're like, oh, this is over.
You know, it's flagpole. It's the end of the level.
Yeah, I can see, I can see. I think that's a fair point for your particular perspective on Mario. Some might say that doing something traditional extremely well is also a great accomplishment of those steps, Matthew.
I shouldn't put it down, I just...
Well, also sometimes those third acts happen end and then the flagpole is kind of just a full stop on it.
That is true.
That's a whole other thing. Anyway, that was my long answer to your question about that particular thing. Is there any other transformation you want to point out here?
I don't really remember the air one that well, to be honest.
As in the Flying Mario?
Oh yeah, the Flying Mario. I guess...
I'm sorry, Flying Mario is maybe the biggest miss in the whole game for me.
So when do they use Flying Mario in the actual levels? Never. Oh, okay, so it's just in the observatory and that one level where you collect those coins?
Yeah.
Oh, that's it? That is a bust.
You unlock it and then you can just fly around the observatory with it. And you're like, well, I don't want to do that. I'm like, what's up there?
Oh, nothing. Oh, right. Well, I seem to...
In Mario 64, when you get flight in that, I remember that being proper blow your socks off. I just couldn't believe I was flying like that in a video game with the wing cap and all that. You know, I was thinking, oh my God, I can't believe I'm flying.
I've got to tell my friends about this at school. Look, I'm actually flying. And then you get this and it's just fly around this tiny little place, which you've already explored fully.
Look, there's nothing else to discover. I hate the color scheme of it. It looks like it's like, I always think of him as like leather Mario.
He's got like a black cap and black dungarees. It's like, it's his Al Pacino in Cruisin Mario. It's got big that energy and he just flies around looking for a good time.
That is not the reference I was expected to hear on this podcast, but I mean, you know, enjoyed it nevertheless. I mean, yeah, that is pointless when you put it like that. I mean, it does have that brief moment of, oh wow, things are about to escalate.
But then you're right, because there's no other gameplay function to it. It's a bit of a dead end really. Did they do anything more in the second one with Flying Mario?
Is that more of them or?
I don't know if he's even in it.
All right. Okay. Well, fair enough then.
It is a bust. We can agree that's a bust.
Because I guess the nature of the game, like it isn't a fully 3D space. They haven't like modeled the space between planets, you know. It's almost like a cutscene, isn't it, that fires you between them.
Well, it's not quite that, but you know, I don't think they can just put you in like the good egg galaxy and go, go on then, just fly around and see what happens. Because you'd realize it's all like broken as shit and none of it actually holds together.
Yeah, I do like the idea of just becoming this kind of no clip mode that completely fucks the game up. That's a fun notion, but yeah, I could see why they didn't do it.
Just a sheet of shaking his head. No, don't, don't put him in any level, it doesn't work.
Yeah, so you said there are two good transformations and you mentioned Spring Mario is one of them. It's B the other one then?
Yeah, B is the other one. So they're anti-ice? They're not stellar.
No, they're not. Are you anti-ice Mario then, in that case?
I hate the fact that both Fire and Ice Mario, they have that terrible theme tune, as I've already demonstrated.
It is a bad theme tune.
And it's just a timing challenge. It's just like a panic. You can't do anything with it.
This is a game which largely lets you express yourself and just experiment and mess around. And apart from those two things, where they're like no you've got 15 seconds or whatever it is, it's such a short amount of time that whenever they turn up it just means there's going to be panic for a bit. It's like they didn't really know what to do with them.
They're just not fun. They're not used in any interesting way. You always know exactly what you've got to do with them.
On paper, Ice Mario, the fact that he can go across water and wall jump off waterfalls, that's quite a visually appealing idea, but it's just always Mario to the stress of using him.
It's just always tied to something frustrating in the game.
And the really annoying thing is at the start of Freeze Flame, they have Mario ice skating on that ice donut. And that's just amazing, you know, the movement there and doing little pirouettes in the air as you jump. Why couldn't that have just been Ice Mario?
Why couldn't he have turned into ice on ice when he's on an ice like that? And it just becomes... You just get to ice skate and express yourself that way.
It feels like a real mistake to then have this quite crap ice transformation 30 seconds after such a majestic bit of animation.
That's interesting. I was 100% convinced that you would tell me that I think simply because the animation is so nice and the visual effects look so good that you would like Ice Mario. That's actually a bit of a surprise to me.
I'm pleased to hear it though because your first impression of it is extraordinary and then the reality of it is so disappointing. I'm glad we agree with that. Fire Mario, the most interesting thing he ends up doing is fucking lighting some little torches or whatever.
Some fucking sub-Zelda bullshit.
Well, that's it. That's a Zelda mechanic. So what's that even doing here?
I mean, it's not very imaginative to be like this. You're in the vast cosmos. You can do anything and we need to just set up a tiny flame on these two little things to open a door.
That's not very interesting by comparison.
No.
I agree with you there. Okay. So I did want to offer up another big take here Matthew, is that I don't think any game in history has more intent to the positioning of its camera than this game.
They think about things like shot composition in a way that you simply couldn't achieve with a standard 3D camera. Sometimes the space between where Mario is standing and some level geometry makes the screen look like a work of art. They thought about the negative space in the middle of gameplay, and I think that's extraordinary.
Sometimes it just looks like a work of art. It also means that sometimes, like I say, you don't have all the information you need to play it as well as you could. This is clearly a battle the developers had during development, but a camera in a game is something I just think of as functional, really.
Yes, I can think of moments in Uncharted, for example, where you are shown an amazing vista, and it's like you got to cross the city because there's a civil war going on over there or whatever, and it will give you an amazing skyline here or there. But this game does so much more with this camera. It's like you just have a simple piece of tubular level geometry, and then you have Mario on the right side of the screen, and then in the middle of the screen, there'll be nothing, but the camera's pulled out for there to be nothing.
So I wonder what you thought of that side of the game.
Always something I've loved. I maybe notice it a bit more when you're firing yourself around the galaxy and you use those warp trails, and they're barely interactive. You're just using the pointer to hoover up star bits as you fly between the planetoids.
But they always find the most interesting angle for those journeys. Some of the best examples are in Melty Molten Galaxy where the warp star is in the mouth of a volcano and as you fire from it the volcano erupts behind you. There is some where you're basically skimming over the surface of the sun and all these fireballs are arcing in a tunnel above you.
It's as controlled and cinematic as Nintendo games ever get, but I do really love that stuff. I think it's interesting when you talk about that coming at the price of maybe like readability and some of like the platforming or some things being maybe a little bit harder than they should be.
Sometimes I think it does.
Yeah I think I might have agreed you do at one point. I just think if you're familiar enough with the game you do have a little bit of muscle memory about how it all works. There are certain individual jumps that when I mess them up I'm like oh yeah I've I always do that.
I've messed that up every single time. Because of that I'm willing to accept there is something about that level, that particular piece of design that misleads you in some way or makes it hard to work out exactly where you're going to go. I remember getting stuck in the same couple of places but I do think those places vanish over time just through familiarity so it's maybe a little bit hard but you know to kind of rewind the clock and remember how it was that first time because I definitely you know died way more playing this the first couple of times so I you know I don't I don't argue against it I think that's that sort of tracks with what I remember.
I wouldn't want to lose that camera work in the hope of fixing that other stuff almost like I don't mind you know I like the look of the game. I accept it's a very key it's it's like the key part of you know how the levels are presented it's not just enough to design the the spherical worlds if you had the spherical worlds and you had a camera locked behind Mario like a traditional 3d camera it's the visual identity of the game is completely different the camera is such a fundamental part of how the game is presented yeah you couldn't imagine a world without it and so I think it's I think it's worth the occasional losses that you get from that decision it's not the end of the world there's definitely I would say like five to ten levels where I thought you could give me a little bit more here than you're actually giving me and I could it would make this game a little bit less this level a little bit less fiddly but um yes I did want to know it because I just thought yeah like it's a pretty amazing achievement as well and they thought about it loads based on that water water ass it's it's part of the design of the game in this very specific way I like that you saw these screens which you described as works of art yet the only images you shared on Twitter was you going fuck this bit and then and then like a hazy phone photograph of a screen no those are all screen grabs taken with the switch yourself back oh yeah they were then I take it back you're gonna hang any of those works of art on your wall well no sometimes I was sort of like baiting you into thinking I didn't like the game as much as I was that what it was I was watching it going haha from afar the idea of you getting stuck on it well clearly this worked out well for both parties yeah but yes that was just a little bit of a castle bait but also you know there were moments that like raised the blood pressure in this but they were counterbalanced by all the bits I did like so that's that's fine so let's get to favorite galaxies and Matthew yeah what are yours well I got loads I'll start off with I think like the purest sort of distillation of what I love about my galaxy uh flip switch galaxy oh right okay yeah that's an interesting choice a standalone level which you control in that every time you do a spin jump blue platforms switch to red and red's platforms switch to blue I've talked about this strand of levels because this is something they've done in in every 3d mario since like the idea of quite a simple to look at platforming gauntlet you know just a load of platforms hanging over a space but there is one weird little gimmick designed to sort of like fuck with your head a bit and here it's the move that would usually save you actually makes the situation worse because the land you're jumping towards won't be there if you use the extra spin jump it's just like one idea executed perfectly that builds out from this particular move set that can exist in a game which just allows you to have a throwaway galaxy that exists for one star yeah and they do a couple more like this in Mario Galaxy 2 which I also really like and Mario Wonder's got some great variations on this as well like a fundamental bit of like platform fuckery I'm into it it's funny because this is in the bracket of level I describe as thank god that's over once it's done like it's I'd might buy admire the intent of it and I have enjoyed the way that this has popped up in other the way it's used in 3d world where every time a player jumps it flips and it could be any player that's hilarious that's like some of the best co-op game design yeah ever so I like the I agree the idea of like we've got this one idea it has this moment in the Sun then we move on is great a more traditional level I really like boy boy boy boy base hmm that's a that's interesting yeah yeah I mean there are like three slightly militaristic levels in Mario Galaxy this is the smallest of them this battle rock this and Dreadnought Galaxy which all have the same music which is the slightly sort of militaristic I always think it sounds a bit like Russian something about it it's the one which makes me think most of like a space program specifically right and yeah you climb this big tower it's a lovely platforming challenge like proper like old you know old school lots of platforms move in about that I really like and then you get to the top and you unscrew this orb and then there's like a semi orb of water inside and it's just this surreal little moment where you have to swim towards the star at the end like I just don't think you're expecting to swim at the peak of this tower that's what you know that's like a that's a pure galaxy touch of like anything could be here maybe the first level I remember playing it when I was reviewing it where where you know I was having a great time but that was like oh that is just absolutely brilliant that that I'm in this water at the end of this level and it's almost like a big poker ball and you unscrew it with the spin jump and all this kind of stuff I love I love boy base I just wish you could say I like that too that level is one that also feels like it's got it's got stuff going on that doesn't involve you you know it's sort of like it feels it feels like there's a lot going on once you arrive and you're a bit like it's like a really concentrated small space level so it feels like there's a lot happening in one fairly little location and doesn't really take you anywhere else so that's I do like that about it as well that's a good choice. I do really like Battle Rock Galaxy which is yeah the first of the the Russian military installations it's got a purple coin challenge which unlocks quite late in the game so I don't know if you would have got to it or not but there's a big moving platform that moves along and all these cannons are firing at you and you know the gimmick is you can obviously run onto the underside of the moving platform like it has its own gravity there and so it's like a you know on the first time you do it it's simple dodge the cannons and dodge the laser fire except you can run you know upside down on the platform if you wish which I really like but on the purple coin challenge there's a very particular path of purple coins you have to collect as the platform moves along and you know some of them they go over the lasers and they force you to do these like perfectly timed back flips that like arc through the coins and it's just really satisfying when they do match the movement with the challenge so perfectly I think that really shows off you know how good a character is to control so I really like that level mmm that's a good choices keep going I like the ice donut in freeze flame I don't know if the rest of freeze flame is as good as the ice donut at the start hmm I mean you swore at it a lot which is just not yeah I was trying to just remember which parts of it were the what was that I've really kind of like lost my my sort of mind with was it the secret star where you have to climb up using the fire flower and you have to melt the snowmen along the way and there's lots of boulders rolling down ramps yes it's it's freezy peak that's it it's fucking freezy peak it's yeah it's like yeah you you you can complete it one way but you can go do a slightly annoying platforming challenge to get to this higher place and then it's got some of the most obscene hitbox big snowballs that knock you off of ledges on along the way and that was a proper once they got to the top of that I was like fuck this into the bin like there's one one last snowball before you get to the very top of that that has a there's a little jutting platform you can go on to but but if you are not stood on the very edge of that platform away from the snowball the snowball can still clip you and knock you the fuck down to the tier below and that happened to me no less than like five times and infuriating yeah so that definitely stands out for sure.
I really like the Toy Time Galaxy cause it's the home of Spring Mario it's got that level where it's all made of chocolate and cake is a big Spring Mario showcase but I also I just like the chocolate and cake of it all.
Can we agree that the big Bowser robot fight in this is bullshit though because that that level that sucks getting up that thing with Spring Mario is ass that's what I that's how that's how I felt about it do you do you not agree with that Matthew?
I mean that's that I would say that's the final act of that particular level where obviously it all comes exploding into life and you truly understand the genius of the idea. I did like the level otherwise and it feels like the sort of thing that is just perfect for the the format of games they made and has some just looks visually extraordinary as well so yeah I do I did like this one yeah yeah I think the level with the best vibes but not necessarily the best challenges is Gusty Garden Galaxy yeah so I would agree with that that music kicks in you're like oh that rules but this is pretty annoying getting from using that blowing in the wind thing on the flowers like that it's a pretty vague mechanic that it doesn't quite have the stuff you know yeah yeah and I also I mean I like most of the levels to be honest but I do like the sort of gauntlets that precede the Bowser boss fights like they're kind of like supercharged versions of the Mario 64 boss gauntlets you know you get that cool bit of music that you know they're often a little bit tricky isn't this I think it's Bowser's dark matter reactor has loads of 2d sections with like changing gravity fields and you have to stay on a moving platform trying not to fall off by being in the right position when gravity changes that stuff's I love that 2d stuff when that kicks in in this game.
Yeah, I was going to say that's one of my highlight levels for sure. Like it's just a bit, it's also got the patches of the dark matter that look really nice. Like every now and then it will just be that fusion of Mario imagery with weird sci-fi imagery where it's like, this game is quite trippy really and that's probably the best example of it.
You do have both those things sitting by side by side. You're like, it's really weird that Bowser's covered all these platforms and dark matter in it. It looks like this.
It's all a little bit unholy and 2001-ish at times where you're like, what exactly is the deal with this? And then yes, you'll be in a big toy level and you're like, oh no, this game is quite daft actually. But yeah.
Do you think it's weird that everyone dies at the end of this game and then it basically brought back to life?
Is that what happens in the story?
Well, it's like a black hole. Bowser's thing makes like a black hole and it sucks it in like everything and destroys it. And then that star kind of turns into a new version of the same galaxy.
Oh yeah, I guess that is what happens. Yeah. And then Bowser's just there.
I think it's implied that everyone dies.
That is a canonical ending of this. Yeah, I think you've caught a lot of the really good ones there. I mean, you know, you got to just hand it to the first few levels in the game.
There's been like amazing examples of what you can do with this game. Good Egg Galaxy and it's, yeah, they're just fantastic. And like I mentioned, I think Matthew's mentioned some of the key ones there, but I really do think the Melty Molten Galaxy is terrific stuff, even with the big sort of like ball motion control nonsense I mentioned earlier.
It could have been a Spring Mario level, but I can't yourself lie to you.
Well, it's just that, again, they're just really flexing their muscles. When that volcano goes off, it's amazing. And then the tempo of the level will change.
So suddenly, you're suddenly just beyond these floating balls in the sky, away from the lava. And you're like, wow, it's just, they could just do a lot with the sort of like pacing of the action in this. Not all of the levels are winners here, but the way that Deep Dark Galaxy changes, one of the notes that I made here is that Deep Dark Galaxy is delightful, especially the toads taking cover from a fat mole in a turret who's shooting at them and they're guarding themselves with beach gear.
And they got these turned over little kind of like beach beds and chairs and stuff, and all the toads are just in cover from this mole. That was good. Yeah, I did like that.
And I do also like the fact that the game has that series of levels where, I think a seaslide galaxy where it's just like a little race and some mini-game nonsense around a sort of track. And it's sort of like, that's just quite a nice sort of pacing departure, you know?
I do like city slide. My only problem with that is like, it's a race course level, and it's clearly a race course level. But then they set some non-racing challenges in it.
And I was never as convinced about those. It's what we have to collect a load of silver stars. And there isn't a lot of like, stuff for you to actually climb.
Of all the levels they choose to squeeze six stars out of, that's like one I would have not have pegged as being one of those levels. Maybe that is what makes it surprising, I don't know. I love the way water looks in this game.
Yeah, it's really, considering it's not a HD game, it looks pretty amazing, really, considering the limitations of it. Yeah, in terms of like, the colors used and stuff. I'm a big space junk galaxy guy, Matthew.
I really love that, because I think that's one of the first times you see the little toads in their spaceships, and they're like, oh yeah, we're along for the adventure as well. It's just the way that it feels like all this discarded sci-fi ephemera that you're sort of moving between, and it's one of the levels that makes the most use out of the motion control, or like gravity sort of movement and stuff. And I think it's like a pretty successful example of it, while looking pretty striking as well.
Also a striking indictment of how poorly mankind has treated space.
Indeed, just dumping our shit everywhere, because there's infinite amounts of space, isn't there? This is more for the image than anything, but Big Mouth Galaxy being this big frozen, like stone whale thing in the middle of space, pretty striking, and then it's got its own body of water inside. It's just one level, but stands out just by, again, just having one idea and going for it.
So I do like that, but otherwise, I think we caught most of them, Matthew. And so now we move on to the ones we like less well. I've mentioned Matter Splatter Galaxy.
I was going to say Bonefin Galaxy. Seems cool, the idea of a big undead shark thing that you have to fight, but just the combat mechanics and the swimming mechanics just aren't quite up to it, unfortunately. So that comes to mind, but what about you, Matthew?
Just because I don't think Boo Mario is up too much, I'm not crazy about Ghostly Galaxy.
Don't like the music? Music's good.
I'm not a big Mario ghost house guy in general.
I like the music.
The haunted strand of Mario's universe is the bit of it that appeals to me the least. I do like a Boo, I like the look of a Boo, I think they're quite cute.
Luigi's Mansion you like?
Yeah, I've been replaying that on the GameCube Virtual Console.
Are you finding it?
Quite fun. I've played it for about half an hour so I'm about 70% of the way through it.
Very good, very good.
Ghostly Galaxy also has that Baldergeist daredevil run where you have to do it with one life, which I think that's one of the harder stars in the game. Ironically, given my love for it earlier in this episode, when I was talking about my NGamer days, Honey Hive is totally played out for me now. I've just seen it too much, I've written about it too much, we drew it too much, I've studied it too much.
There isn't much to it. I much prefer the autumnal flip later on, Golden Leaf.
I think Honey Hive Galaxy's got a bit of Banjo-Kazooie energy about it. I'll be honest with you. That's maybe the most damning thing I can say about a game.
Banjo-Kazooie would kill for the soundtrack that this game has. Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, oh yeah. Koji Kondo would basically be shaking his head at Yokota.
I don't know if you've got it, man.
It just feels sort of banjo, banjo in scale. Do you know what I mean? It sort of feels like it could be.
Yeah, I mean, no, go to Galaxy, Honey Hive.
What about Hari Scari Galaxy, where those little green sort of platforms are fucking shrinking as you're jumping across it, and you have to coordinate each jump, basically. How do you find that?
Yeah, that's a bit of a nightmare. There's an even harder version of that as one of the bonus stars in... We were just talking about it, the water race course, whatever that is.
Yeah, I just did that one yesterday and that was a lot of swearing.
That's a pig, that bit where you have to find a perfect route around quite a strange shape that I could never really get my head around.
Yeah, by the time I... Actually, no, that might have been one I noped out of, actually. I think I might have had five attempts and gone, no, and then just got on my life basically.
Oh, five attempts. That's a whole maeltoad's worth of goes.
That is the currency with which we measure lives in the Mario Galaxy universe. Any others, Matthew?
No, the rest of it's a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.
It's pretty good, isn't it? That's the thing. I did enjoy the vast majority of them.
I will agree with you actually on Honey Hive Galaxy. I was a little bit like, playing that. That's also one where the camera can get a bit fucked and stuck behind a certain cliffs or whatever when you want it to move a certain way.
It's a little bit underwhelming, but then picks up pretty quickly after that.
When they do the purple coin challenge in that, it's quite a strange one because that level is so early in the game, you're like, oh, that's easy. That's not going to be difficult. There's no time limit.
There's just a hundred coins to collect. But they put a couple of them so on the edge of the level that you're very likely to fall off and die and then have to do it again from scratch. So I remember from being across with it over the years that now, I always go for the impossible coins first.
If I get those, then I'll go and collect all the easy coins rather than collecting 99 easy coins and then biffing it at the end. They knew what they were doing with that one. Quietly, a very infuriating level.
Yeah. They got something like that in Melty Molten Galaxy where the lava starts rising. I think it's Melty Molten Galaxy.
You got to keep climbing and climbing and climbing until you get to the star. Along the way, there's a little extra life jutting off on this cliff along the edge. If you fucked up even one little bit, getting that life will mean certain death for you.
So the second time around when I had died the first time, I was like, fuck you basically as I walked past that life and just kept climbing. It's not worth it, bro. It's not worth it.
Not when you've got a male toad out in the lobby with fucking five of the things.
Peach never says much in those letters, does she? She's like, oh, I'm so sad I got kidnapped out.
Terrible letter writer. She will never be quoted by that Letters of Note Twitter account.
No, she's like, it's like getting texts from your dad getting an email from Peach in this game.
Terrible letter writer.
Unless like, Bowser's intercepting and censoring her post, which we may never know if that's what's going on.
She's actually writing some like, some quite hot stuff in those letters. Bowser's just like, you cannot see it. That disgusts me.
I mean, I don't know what's the postal situation is in Bowser's castle that she's able to just send in my game about a hundred letters.
Yeah, it is like that. She does seem to have, she does churn them out quite a lot, but I don't think those toads have loads to do. They crash their spaceship at that one level, and then they've repaired it and they're just getting on with their business, and there's loads of them.
He's got a lot of staff, Mario. I will say that about him.
Actually, while we're on the subject of NPCs, I can't believe this hasn't come up. Where do you land on the old Hungry Loomers?
I think they got a lot of us energy. Yeah, definitely. There's one I haven't done.
There's the one that wants like 1600 at the end. I've got that one still to do. They're all right, but this is probably a good transition point to talk about the Comet Observatory as a sort of structural hook for the game Matthew, because it does basically space out all his levels into these individual buildings around this larger structure.
It seems like from what I've played of Mario Galaxy 2 already that they've ditched that. And so I was wondering, well, what do you think of it?
It's the part of the game I resent more on each subsequent playthrough.
Yeah, I don't think it works either.
The first time I was like, oh, this is cool. And it's got a few little secrets. It hasn't really got many secrets at all.
It's got a leather Mario who doesn't fly anywhere. Even after all these years, I find it quite confusing to navigate. I never really remember which beam of light takes me where because you can't really look around it.
I always lose track of the bedroom which is tucked behind it. So I end up playing loads of levels that aren't in there and I have to go back and do all these like medium difficulty levels at the end of the game. It's absolutely fine but having to go to all these individual places to trigger the levels, especially when the comets get involved and it might not even be serving you the kind of level you want.
By the time it gets to 2, yeah, I think that is one of the big plus points of 2 over 1. Is it just like lets you get on with it?
If I can tell you what the toughest hang was in this game, it was the five minutes where I sat through every chapter of Rosalina's book. I mean, good lord, that's like...
You're not going to be buying that book when they print it then?
No, I don't think that's going to pop off on Book Talk somehow. That was like, good lord, it was just flowery nonsense prose. And in some ways, I didn't really like any of the story stuff that happened in the Comet Observatory.
Like any of the Rosalina stuff, I wasn't really... There's not loads of it, but I wasn't really interested in what her whole situation is. So I was kinda like, well, there's already a female protagonist in these games.
And we're already trying to rescue her. I don't really know what your deal is. I'm glad you got these little star pals.
They seem like good guys.
So you are going to be DLC for the rest of your life?
It does also seem like... I wondered if the observatory is like it is because they thought, well, befitting the kind of like grand scope of what we've built, we need to give you a large space to enjoy in between the levels. But I agree, it's like a...
Structurally, I just find it a bit of a bummer. Like when you get sent back and you have to run back to one of the little huts or whatever, for whatever reason, I'm just like, I just...
It just feels like a sort of hangover from having Hubworlds in 64 and Sunshine. But there, the Hubworlds were big enough that they had like their own culture of secrets hidden there. And that just isn't true here.
There's really not a lot going on in that place.
Music's amazing though.
It is. That's great. Comet Observatory.
When all the music, when all the instruments kick in once you've done all the different worlds, that's mint. It's great stuff that. So that's a word I've never ever said in this podcast before.
That's like, that's good music to like walk down the aisle to.
It is like, absolutely, yeah, like amazing music. There are times where the orchestra in this is so impressive. I'm like, I think I forgot that this piece of music was the back of my brain and like that it was Mario music and not music from a film or something.
Because it really is like, yeah, just incredibly impressive. Penultimate question Matthew, what do you make of the Switch 2 version of the game? Does it ever make as much sense without the traditional motion controls, as in if you played it handheld mode, does it work without it?
It actually made me appreciate the fact that the Switch can imitate the Wii so well. There's something we just never really praised about the console. If you wanted to port something from Wii to this, you can do it one to one basically.
However, I am also glad that this is no longer the default way the Nintendo games control. I don't miss it so much. So what do you make of the Switch version?
I really don't like the game in handheld mode. Having to use the touch screen to like activate certain things, pick up star bits. I think it is just an inferior way to play.
Like I don't want to be running my hands all over that screen when I'm playing it. I do find the motion controlled pointer a tiny bit more fiddly than I remember finding the Wii remote pointer back in the day. But that might just be, you know, like nostalgia for that console talking.
It's generally fine. You know, I wouldn't say it like transforms it in any way.
Yeah, I agree with that. I think it's like a, you know, it looks nice in HD, which is the important thing really. And yeah, I agree this.
I played through the entire game on my TV with the controls. It felt like this is the way it's meant to be played. And I'll be doing the same for Mario Galaxy 2.
That was going to be my last question to you, Matthew. I've still not played Super Mario Galaxy 2 as a recorder. I did the first level and I was like, oh yeah, this is Mario Galaxy.
I got to the little Hub World bit. And can you tease what I've got in store ahead of the XL episode coming on Monday?
Based on this episode, I mean, people say Mario Galaxy 2 is like the hard one, where they get to sort of like let, you know, having sort of established what you know, you know, having established all the rules in Mario Galaxy 1, they can sort of let rip in this one a little bit more. You know, knowing some of your frustrations with it, I'm interested in how that stuff's going to land with you. There's a big question mark over Yoshi and you and whether you're going to be pals.
I'm interested in that Yoshi, the only power-up who has his own power-ups. We'll definitely be chattin about that.
Is Spring Mario a Mario Galaxy 2?
I'll let you see for yourself.
Well, that could be a net gain if they got rid of him, but you know, we'll find out.
I think some of the power-ups are much better. I think Cloud Mario is really interesting when you get to that. In my head, and I've only played a little bit of Mario Galaxy 2 for this episode, it has less, like, pointer, motion control gimmickry going on, but I don't know if that's true.
So I'm interested to see if that is true or not. It's a game I've only played a couple of times compared to Mario Galaxy 1, so we shall see.
Indeed, yes. So that will be on mondayonpatreon.com/backpagepod, or the XL tier. You can listen to us do this again with Mario Galaxy 2.
We'll do the same thing, where we go through the, it was us talking about the background of the game, Matthew's experience with it. And yeah, it's all fresh to me. So I look forward to talking about it, Matthew.
But this was a delight going through this. I, yeah, look forward to doing the same with other Nintendo games in the future.
I'm so glad we remain friends.
It was touch and go there. But the important thing was, I just needed you to hear me out on the transformation. So I was really worried you're going to be like, oh, well, that's the best bit of the game, the fact that you can transform.
But it's like a flawed first draft of what they would do in Odyssey, right? That's the thing. I appreciate them having a try, with the exception of Spring Mario, who can go to hell.
I'll see. Yeah.
I'd still take B Mario over being like a manhole cover in Odyssey.
That's fair enough. But hey, Mario Odyssey is a whole other thing. So, yes.
Where can people get you on social media, Matthew?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd.
Matthew is newly engaged with the world of film. He's seeing movies left, right and centre. So, takes.
Lukewarm takes. Poorly written as I stumble out of the cinema.
Is that not the essence of Letterboxd? I'm Samuel W Roberts on Blue Sky, Twitter, Letterboxd. You can get me on there.
Back Page Pod if you would like to follow the podcast on either Twitter or Blue Sky. Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
