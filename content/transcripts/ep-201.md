Hello, and welcome to The Back Page A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, from Joined As Ever by Matthew Cussin.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. How are you doing? Should we preface this by saying you're not feeling too good?
Yes.
And then I will ask you, how did you find the reception to episode 200?
I found it very satisfying, pleasing, and also a relief, because while I thought it was good, there's always that thing of like, are people gonna dig it? Are they gonna get it? And kind of lock into its vibe?
Is this horribly self-indulgent? I mean, yes, but also, can you still enjoy it in its self-indulgence? And people seemed to, and the feedback was all good.
I think like universally positive, actually. I've only seen good stuff, and I've had to spend a lot of it telling you, people going, oh, it was so good. And then going, yeah, yeah.
I mean, like Sam wrote it and did it all, and so that's made me feel bad for not contributing more. But as a collective project, it's been like a net gain for the podcast, which is good.
Well, you did produce it to a very high standard. So that is key to it. The fact that it sounds quite professional.
Someone messaged me and said, they must have got a guy to do this, then realized it was just you. So that was very nice.
Yeah, I mean, that is true. I am just a guy.
Yeah, I guess like a paid guy who does this for a living. Plus some of the jokes, about five or six of the jokes were yours as well. I think a few of those got mentioned in the Discord.
So they were just going in there and punching it up. Like that guy who only does the swear words and the thick of it. That was like you in this basically, a little bit of Matthew Castle punch up.
My mom listened to it and was talking to me about it at the weekend actually and said, she was like, not that it feels like a little raw, but she said, I wonder if there was more truth in some of your snipes at each other, then you would readily let on. I was like, I don't know.
No, not at all. Of course not. That's ridiculous.
They were like, it was just pure self-awareness and understanding.
Well, that's the thing. Yeah, that's what I took it as.
Yeah, that's it. I wasn't, it wasn't me airing my grievances with you on an anniversary episode. That's a lot of effort to go to just for that, isn't it?
So yeah, it was meant to be a convincing lampoon.
I think it was too convincing for her.
Well, like, you know, I'm not, no, that's stuff that really bothers me. I think it only actually works because it wasn't personal at all, really. So, I mean, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
So good stuff. Okay, so, the self-indulgence is out of the way for now. That's probably a lie, but, you know, it's at least partially put to one side.
And we're excited to welcome back Jay Baylis, one of our favourite podcast guests. Jay's last episode went down incredibly well when we talked about the recent history of Japanese games about a month or two ago. Really, really good.
So it's a treat to have him back on so soon. Jay, how's it going?
Great, thanks. I'm really excited to talk about films. I believe today's episode is a discussion on Francis Ford Coppola's Megalopolis.
Normally, I come on and we do some serious industry talk, so I'm really excited to hack it out about one of cinema and one of cinema's greatest authors.
Yeah. You were one of the people who was telling me, you need to go and see this film. That's like a disaster, but is something.
How best would you describe Megalopolis, Jay?
The magic of movies, that's what it's all about. It's just seeing something confusing on the screen that costs a lot of money. I mean, we're in video games, that's also not far off the industry we're involved in.
Yeah. Do you like to have Jay back on? We're here to discuss backloggeddon.
I don't want to close my eyes, etc. No, it's not that. It's very much in the vein of, we all have too many games to play, and there's some interesting statistics out there that suggest we all have fewer and fewer hours to dedicate to the new games that we want to play.
This is statistically proven apparently with the amount of time that people in general put into live service games and older games. There's going to be some of that in this episode. But despite what I just said, I promise it won't be boring.
For one, Jay's here, so it won't be boring on that basis alone. Matthew's here, he's not feeling very well, but he'll contribute some laughs every now and then. In general, I think we've got a pretty solid plan here to kick us off.
Jay, I did want to ask in general how things are going with you. I believe you have a new update for your game, Cassette Beasts, coming out, or at least that's what your message to me on Discord suggested before we started recording. Is that the case?
I believe by the time this comes out, we'll have timed this correctly, so I haven't broken NDA, and yeah, we'll have just announced a new update for Cassette Beasts. I believe that's the only interesting and important thing happening this week. Yeah, nothing else, so you know, very cool stuff.
What's in the update?
The update, which I haven't announced yet, but technically will have by the time you're hearing this. We've just done a new content update where we've put out this gauntlet mode, where you can battle with your friends and do a series of battles that get increasingly hard, kind of post-gamey fun content. It's a lot of fun, actually.
I'm pretty pleased with how it's turned out.
Have you patched in a cassette beast that you can only get by going to certain electronic stores in Japan and playing little booths there? Like is there something like that, something that's very, you know, for the real heads, for the future wiki generations?
Yeah, you have to take your Steam Deck to one of six Cinna Worlds across the country. And you have to stand in like the worst queue of all time. And then some of your schoolmates will see you because they're going to see a real film.
And then you'll have to explain that you weren't there to do the event, because it's embarrassing.
Yeah, I think that is cool to hear that your game is still being updated. And people can still play that on Game Pass, right? And it's available at all platforms now, pretty much.
Pretty much. We're not on PlayStation, but we're on most of them.
Cool, awesome. So yeah, available on Steam and available on Game Pass, PC and Xbox and a Nintendo Switch as well. So yeah, really cool that we know a successful indie game developer.
Still something I can still bring up at parties, which goes down well, Jay. And yes, delighted to have you back on. So Jay, you kind of inspired this episode.
You sort of like kicked this off in my brain. What was that kickoff point? You mentioned the concept of backlogged into me early this year.
You didn't use that exact word, but I've seen you since use it on Twitter. I think it's come up rather a lot this year because there's been a few older games that have been kicking around the charts in recent years, in recent months.
I mean, to an extent, it feels very UK charts to see very particularly like, okay, everyone's still buying like Fallout 4 over and over again and things like that. GTA 5. Yeah, it's kind of in response to these trends of, you know, so many expensive, we've had so many kind of triple A disappointment in like in terms of, you know, commercial success titles in the past couple of years.
And then it's really interesting to kind of see that trend alongside checking out the trots. And it's like everyone's still buying The Witcher 3, you know. And it's just this kind of concept of we're kind of transitioning into, I think backloggedon was the kind of wanky like Twitter term I used for it.
The idea of keeping up with games as an active thing and, you know, you play the most recent thing and you kind of keep up with this as like an active medium is a little bit fallen by the wayside. And people are not only kind of returning to the same games they've already beaten three times over, but also they're not necessarily in the rush to kind of keep up with the latest releases as they are being released. And they're kind of taking the time with it.
You know, you buy more and more games, everyone's got more Steam games than they'll ever buy. And it's just kind of more of an observation of kind of purchasing trends kind of slowly shifting. And one of my reasons was like the idea that, you know, this backlog add-in is the idea of, you know, you've got so many games you want to play, you don't have time to play the brand new games that just came out because, you know, you're still working through your backlog of things from like six years ago.
And I think a lot of people can probably relate to that to some extent. I'm sure there's something that everyone's like, oh, I'll get around to playing that or I've got that downloaded on Steam, I'll find the time for it. And it's kind of interesting how that clashes with, you know, what we expect out of games.
And especially I think there's a generational angle that we can kind of, you know, dig into later in the episode. But I really do think there's like a kind of slowly dawning awareness of the shifts and trends. And a lot of it was spurned by this article that went round, right?
Yeah, so I saw you share this on Twitter. Ryan K. Rigney, who's this ex Apex Legends cons guy, a really sharp dude who I followed for a while, has a good industry analysis newsletter where he asked if old games are killing new games.
There was some data in there that suggested an increasing amount of player time is spent on games that are more than five years old. That number was 61% in 2023, and that has been growing in the last few years. So if that is indeed true and represented by a lot of players, I think the question is like, what are the reasons for that?
And we're gonna get into this across the episode. I think there's a few different factors that explain it. So yeah, excited to have your take on this, Jay, as someone who I know is eternally trying to clear his backlog.
There's a counterpoint. We also have Matthew Castle, the only man in the United Kingdom with no bank hold of video games because he plays every single video game as they come out. Matthew, as such, do you think the backlog truly exists, or is it like a figment of our imaginations?
No, I definitely have a backlog. I'm just not beholden to it, and they're just there. I don't really know when they're ever going to get played, because I am always so busy trying to keep on top of new games.
Old games slip through the cracks. I guess the only exception is when we decide to play an old game for this episode, and then suddenly I kind of lock in to, you know, kind of completionist mode, and that works. But I do have a backlog.
Like my Steam library is pretty rancid, and I've bought some right old shit on Switch, which I've not played, so I feel like I can weigh in on it.
Yeah, absolutely. I'm just always impressed by how much you get through media in general. But yeah, I think Jay, to start with, then that 61% in 2023 thing.
It is interesting because I think in some ways, this is talking about the kinds of players that are not really the likes of me, you and Matthew. This is more like people who play, you know, Fortnite is like their one game, or Apex is their one game, or League of Legends is their one game.
Yeah.
And the idea is that there's just like less and less time. But I suppose I was curious, like, did you have any thoughts on that newsletter more generally in its observations?
I mean, one thing that is interesting, so they say like 61% is old games, right? Like, you know, think people, games that people are returning to, that came out like several years prior. But then a huge proportion of that remaining percentage is also taken up by, you know, your yearly re-release games.
So I think the number is, if you count, if you were to count like, you know, the latest FIFA or whatever FIFA is now called, I believe it's not FIFA anymore, or like Call of Duty and Battlefield. If you were to take out the annual franchises, then and put those alongside the old games, then only 8% of all game time spent is like remaining. And then that one 8% is then divvied up even further by the fact that, you know, you have your like heavy hitter titles.
So you got like Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate, these big mega hit titles that come out and soak up all the time. And then like, I think they listed like 5 titles a year, roughly, you could ascribe to that kind of heavy hitter bracket, which means that the entire rest of the game industry, every AAA release, every indie release, fits about 5% of the actual time spent on games, which is like a really interesting metric to think about. I think it's so alien to a lot of people who kind of play games and have followed games, because I think from our generation, it's almost like when there's discussions, every time a big publisher releases a live service game and people ask online, like why are they chasing that model?
That's like an outdated model. That's like a model that's already been eaten up. It's more like live service game, an annual re-release game, is nine-tenths of the industry, and the industry where you kind of make and release and sell a game and then do another one, is almost like a niche part of the actual industry.
It's really interesting to think about. Like every Nintendo title ever released exists in this 5% bracket.
Yeah, Matthew, do you have any thoughts on that?
Yeah, I mean, that is wild, particularly when you think about the Nintendo of it all. Yeah, the thing that jumped out at me was that, from like a media perspective, the audience I feel games media is talking to and is competing for is the audience who is strictly invested in that remaining 10%. And, you know, you're not covering any of these other things.
You know, you cover the tip of the iceberg. The actual games people are playing, unseen beneath the ocean, are all these older games, live service games, your regular yearly updates. And, you know, it's not just the game makers competing for that audience.
You know, you have anyone who's adjacent to games also competing for that attention span. And it is kind of wild. And it does also explain, like, why certain things can feel massive in media circles.
And it doesn't translate into anything. And you're like, well, that's weird. Like, everyone was talking about Alan Wake 2.
But that's kind of done fuck all in the grand scheme of things. And you're like, well, yeah, of course, because it's like a niche. It's a niche of a niche of a niche, you know?
And that's the thing which was really wild about those numbers. And it should sort of make sense. At first, when I read the article, I was like, well, yeah, obviously, you know, there are more games before five years ago than there are now.
If you're comparing games made this year to the thousands and thousands of games, which were made pre-2020, then statistically, you would think that it would weigh out like that. But I think the one that just took me by surprise was how the yearly iterations of FIFA and NBA 2K and whatnot, which are the biggest eaters of the new game time, they still only exist inside that 40% or whatever. And I thought that would have been much bigger, given the way they talk about them and the way that they just move on instantly.
What are these people fucking doing? Who are these people? I guess they're all playing roadblocks, is that it?
I definitely think there is a huge aspect to this, which is like this big generational divide. I mean, I think a huge part of this is so like, how the quote unquote younger generation like, interfaces with games and for clarification, if you're listening to this, this means not you.
Brutal but accurate.
Like, anyone under a certain age bracket, like how they think about games, I think you have to think about like, so like the ages that we are and they kind of how we grew up with games media and you know, the age of, you know, following games and magazines and kind of seeing, you know, which, which version of Castlevania on PlayStation versus Nintendo 64, which one has the better graphics and like, the kind of like, like technological upkeep and technological race aspect of games and kind of games almost as a medium of like, getting to experience the latest like computer technological innovation, which I think was a huge driving factor in like, how we think about games. Is everyone, you know, born, everyone who like remembers the 90s and older, you know, that's how we think about games. It's like this kind of almost like being a tourist of, you know, technological and artistic innovation in this field.
Whereas I think for a whole generation of people younger than us, like the roles of games are much more of like, they exist in this kind of social space. So with those, like with those figures, you know, so one of the survey numbers that I looked, I found was like 80% of people under 18 play games. And the overwhelming majority of those games are lies service games with like, you know, user generated content and social aspects.
So Fortnite, like Minecraft and Roblox are platforms unto themselves in the same way that like all of Nintendo is one platform, you know? Minecraft is not just like a whole game or a whole series. It's like a whole avenue of thinking about games in the way that like being a Nintendo fan is almost.
Like the scale of it is like just that grand. It has its own, like Minecraft is a great example of like, okay, there's like Minecraft culture and there's like, you know, like there's entire like companies that exists to service Minecraft servers, Minecraft content creators are some of the biggest celebrities in terms of recognizability in the world. It's a whole like world of media unto itself.
And the way that the people who play those games interact with them is primarily is like a social space. I mean, you could probably do like a whole podcast series like solely on like how gaming as a social space has existed and why like teenagers are like increasingly favoring, you know, spending time in online spaces. It could be down to the fact that like, I don't know, like society just kind of hates teenagers and being anywhere, so that's where they end up in Minecraft and Roblox.
Yeah, increasingly hostile world towards teenagers, I guess.
It's an increasingly hostile world towards young people and as a consequence, the way that they kind of interact and interface with games, I think, is entirely, it's like this entirely alien world to us, I think. I think like even, I mean, I'm at a weird age where I was still actually in school when Minecraft came out, but I was like the kind of the tail end of seeing the kind of shift of how people kind of think about games and spaces and things. And it's interesting, isn't it, to think about even, you know, something as big as Nintendo only operates just a small bracket that exists on the outside of bigger platforms like Fortnite and like Minecraft.
To an extent, I think part of that, I mean, one of the things we talked about when I was on last time, we talked about kind of how like the HG generation once you have to start developing high definition assets, you know, everything slowed to a crawl, it became very expensive and slow to develop games. But also, a huge part of that was that the technological leap aspect of gaming and of following gaming kind of disappeared, right? Like in the time between Final Fantasy 6 and Final Fantasy 10, like that like seven year gap where we, you know, millennial gamers would have seen like unfathomable levels of incredible technological innovation is now the distance.
That's like, it takes less time, it took less time to jump from like 16 bit to like Final Fantasy 10 than it did to make Gotham Nights after Arkham Knight, you know? Like everything's big and slow and the whole, I think a whole generation of gamers now have grown up without the aspect of like, you can follow games and every few years there'll be like a whole thing that blows your mind. We've kind of plateaued in that sense.
And I don't think that younger players don't care about impressive graphics, but I think the aspect of following game culture to see that graphical advancement is maybe less prominent. And this is kind of like a vibes-based analysis from me. But I just think that like, I think to an extent, the interest is much more in kind of like how you can use those games to interface with your friends and creating stuff.
Minecraft is just this amazing kind of like Lego box of toys that you can play with your friends. I think following that kind of like personal expression aspect and social expression is much more interesting to younger gamers than the like, holy shit, if you wait three years, the next game you see is going to be amazing. You know what I mean?
That doesn't exist anymore, which means that younger players aren't conditioned to get excited for graphical leaps.
Yeah, I think there's a few different takeaways from that. So first of all, you're trying to tell me that people under the age of 24, Jay, do not care about seeing the Gold Saucer from Final Fantasy VII remade in spectacular fashion. You're telling me they don't appreciate that.
Now, that makes total sense to me, actually, because I think about how when I was, you know, when I was like 13, which is probably like the first time I truly got massively into games, the young man, things like school days, and I'd read about that in, you know, like a games master or something, was completely alien to me and therefore not interesting because the agenda of what was interesting to me was being set by the things I was seeing at that moment, or things in the recent past, or things that had released while I was a kid. And so, you know, if you're a young person now, then you have many more options for what that looks like. And also, like you say, there's a culture shift in these things becoming hangouts, spaces, so I can see why there's...
Yeah, I can see why that in some ways that's a little bit of a losing battle, trying to get those players to be interested in if they're gonna remake Resi 5 or not, because that's very much a millennial person's concern, specifically mine. So yeah, I think that's a good point. I suppose then, that's good context.
Should we shift focus to the 8%, the forgotten 8%, Jay? Because I feel like that's probably the area that's most relevant to us. I thought what was really interesting in that article was like New Zoo's data suggest that of that 8%, 1.4% went to Diablo 4 last year, 0.8% went to Hogwarts Legacy, and then 0.6% went to Baldur's Gate 3, and then there are a few others beneath that.
So that shrinks it down further still. So the amount of time free for other games ends up being about 5% below the kind of really big hitters. So that is quite interesting.
I guess to shift focus slightly to get to the backlog element of this, which is very much maybe like a Gen Z and older or millennial concern. When did we all start accumulating massive backlogs? What can we trace it back to in recent video game history?
Jay, start with you.
I think there's a couple of points. Again, some of this is going to be pure vibes-based analysis.
That's what we're here for. We don't do real industry analysis on this podcast.
You're like vibes-packed-er.
I'm not polling anyone, but I think anecdotally, I think a big part of this is like Steam. Everyone buys things on Steam sales because 90 percent off a game that you're vaguely interested in feels like a good deal. I think the emergence of the digital marketplace as a primary way that you play games and purchase games means that transactions become ephemeral.
You can pay for some thing and forget about it, and essentially it doesn't exist in the way that buying a Nintendo 64 cartridge, you have it in your hands, it exists in your life in a more meaningful sense. Once we shifted to digital and then it was just a lot easier for sales and things to occur. You get bigger discounts on digital goods than you will on not resold copies of AAA games in shops.
I do think a big part of it is the jump to digital purchases. But I also think to an extent, there's maybe an argument that just every generation, gaming got bigger and more and more games came out. I just think back to when I was getting into games as a kid and the N64 had been out for a few years.
So I was playing catch up with getting the must play canon games of the N64. And there's like 8 to 10 games that you could say, you've got to check these out at the time. How many of them still hold up, doesn't matter.
But like the pool of big games...
About 12 of them we decided.
About 12. There's about 12 good games and none of them are RPGs except maybe one with Mario in. But then the industry has just gotten just much bigger, you know.
It's big business. Even obviously we're talking about 8% of a bigger business, but it's still a huge business because we live in the digital age. As I pointed out before, 80% of people, like teenagers and younger, play games.
So you're talking about a large swath of earth. I think there's a lot more games now. I think that is a big part of it.
We've gotten pretty good at making games. I think publishers and developers have gotten pretty good at figuring out how to make passively good games. I mean, this is kind of a tangent, but you see people asking why all games scores like 7 or 8 out of 10s.
I think generally when you're investing the amount of money into a game that it costs to make a game now, you don't really make bad games and you can kind of avoid making a bad game pretty easily, which means a lot of stuff that is viably playable gets produced. I think those are two aspects. I think there's probably a lot more things down to, again, as graphics get better, games from 10 years ago still look pretty good.
So you're not feeling the push-off of like, well, it looks too dated now, so I won't get back to it. Everything's looked pretty good for like 15 years as like a kind of ballpark, and I think that is a big part of this. Yeah, and also, again, once you hit the HD era, you got the kind of emergence of like very big games.
Oh, yeah. When I did research for our best Sonic games episode, Jay, that research took about one afternoon, an afternoon in which I finished both Sonic CD and Sonic 3 and Knuckles, so...
They need to make a slow Sonic game so you can really take it in, like a 20-hour Sonic game.
Yeah, that is the thing. I think there's a few things combined here, and we'll pull this out and talk about it bit by bit as we go, I think. But I think that Steam is a big part of it in digital libraries.
That means that you do accumulate this backlog that you never really leave behind, because it's always with you. The games that I bought on 360 back in 2007 are still with me today on my Xbox Series X, and the same is true of the games I started buying on Steam in 2009. So massive backlogs with me at all times.
There's no like, whatever happened to that cartridge of Super Mario Bros. Deluxe I used to have on Game Boy Color? That game is lost to me, but these games will never be lost to me.
And I think that has changed culturally how we play games, how we talk about them, how games stick around. The stickiness of games is also a key part of it in the sense that games got longer.
I think it's a huge part of this.
Yeah, around the 360 era onwards, publishers started making a play for your time, not just your dollar. And so I think that is a huge part of it. It means that the kind of blockbusters like God of War or God of War 2 on PS2, they, across the course of the 360 generation, become less and less relevant as Assassin's Creed type games that are like 20 plus hours long, starts to take hold.
And then I think it basically becomes almost an industry standard that games are like 20 hours plus after that, give or take a few exceptions like an FPS campaign or whatever. And even something like Far Cry is a massive, massive game with loads and loads to do. And yeah, so I think there's a kind of going for your time element to it.
And then I think combined with that, the publishers and developers are deliberately making games stickier so they can keep selling for years and years. Think about next generation patches that come to games like The Witcher 3 or Horizon Zero Dawn being remastered last week. Everyone was scoffing about that and then I think on Friday, everyone saw the before and after and were like, fuck, I want to play that and then went and spent 10 quid on it.
So I think there's a lot at play here. I also think that our relationship with how we play games changed a little bit with the advent of achievement points and stuff. I'm not saying that this is true for everyone, but I do think that that codified a completionist aspect to the way we play games.
So it was maybe a bit more of an optional thing before. It became a bit more of a North Star for people when a lot of people were playing Astro Bot. They were saying, I don't normally get Platinum trophies, but for this game I did.
So there's loads of different things firing off at once that have led to this moment. Matthew, I was curious what you make of this. Do you think there's a point in history where we all started accumulating massive backlogs and any one element that jumps out to you as the reason?
I mean, I'd agree with most of what you say. I think Steam is definitely a huge part of it, and it's still quite ahead of the game in terms of how it pushes sales and how it notifies you, the fact that it's built into your PC and can pin you with little pop-up messages or whatever about things being on sale. I don't think any of the console ecosystems are quite there, where they can surface that stuff as easily.
I think a big part of it as well is this, like the coming of the game giveaway is a big part of subscription plans, games with gold, PS Plus, people, every month you're adding four games that you're going to keep forever to your game collection. These things have been going for at least 10 years, some of them 15 years. When I opened up my Xbox, before Game Pass, I had hundreds and hundreds of digital games that I'd never touched.
It's a backlog that's forced on you that you don't particularly want, but you're going to claim because you may as well. It gets to the point now where Epic Games can give away some crazy things, the things they gave away to try and grow their audience and get people to jump ship from Steam. You just click them for the sake of clicking them.
It's like, oh, may as well. Sometimes you don't even do that. There's such fatigue for free stuff that they give away something that I own maybe on console but not on PC.
I'm like, can I be bothered to go to my PC, turn it on and click on Epic to get that thing? And you're like, no, probably not. But I think that's kind of a little part of it.
It's probably an offshoot of just everything being digital and digital being a thing you can give away for free in a way you couldn't with physical.
Yeah, I was curious how much this particular type of pile of shame is a modern concept versus past generations. I absolutely believe there are people who in the 90s or the late 90s accumulated 30 PS1 games and didn't get through all of them, or 25 N64 games had disposable income, were our age in the 90s and therefore hoovered that stuff up. But like Jay says, I think there is a cutoff point where you are no longer haunted by your back catalog in the way that we are now.
Whether it's because games have come back in a remastered form, or just had an update, or because like you say, you look at a library screen and you are confronted with your history of violence, as it were. Jay, what do you think? Is the pile of shame a modern concept?
Are we only fresh to it because we're millennials? I know you're a younger millennial than us, but we now have disposable income.
I wonder if I think this is something that's been brought up. I think that was in Ryan Rigney's pieces, that maybe a good comparison point is actually something closest to how books operate. Book publishing is in this space where the canon classics, so as it were, are constantly selling year on year and almost exist to subsidize new material.
Then some of that will bleed into that canon of classic must-play games. Then the comparison point is maybe apt in terms of that if you were to compare it to something like films, you can blow through films pretty fast. But a lot of people find it difficult to get through a classic long novel in the same way they may find it difficult to 100% The Witcher 3.
I think that the time-sync aspect of games, especially as they get bigger, maybe does mirror how people think about books. In the same way, if everyone's got a backlog of like, oh yeah, I've been meaning to read The Count of Monte Cristo, but I haven't. And maybe that kind of re-becomes the kind of like, the low culture mirror of that, you know?
I haven't gotten around to, you know, not having read The Three Musketeers is equivalent to like, oh, I haven't picked up Sonic X Shadow Generations yet.
Yeah, War and Peace versus Planescape Torment Remastered.
Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah. And I think, yeah, I think Sonic's actually a very interesting point, because that's a remaster of something that only came out like 12 years ago.
But then again, if you think about the median age of a Sonic fan is someone who is like 10 years old, which means that was an old game from before they were born, if you want to feel dreadfully ancient. So maybe that kind of strategy of kind of like, remastering things you already have on file to kind of service a new generation of fans, every generation. Like I can see the logic in that.
People always like make fun of, how many times can you release The Last of Us? But if there's a new, there's always like new audiences of younger players who are kind of interested. I think to an extent, people who get into things like, let's say you're into games on a social level via Roblox, and Fortnite, and Genshin Impact, but then it makes you interested in games as a medium.
So then you use things like Game Pass to dip into the legacy history of these platforms and get interested in the medium. I don't think it's correct. I think it's wise to avoid the idea that younger people are not interested in retro games as such.
I think if anything, there's a huge audience for younger players discovering this backlog of content. But again, they're discovering that backlog. If you're a Sonic fan, if you're a theoretical, hypothetical, invented 10-year-old Sonic fan, you can ask your parents to pay $50 to buy you the new Sonic X Shadow game, or you can spend a month just going through the backlog of ones you can find on Game Pass.
To an extent, getting into the backlog mindset is economical.
Yeah, it's interesting to say that, actually, because there is definitely a strain of streamers and content creators who make videos around retro stuff who were definitely not there at the time. There's a few of them I follow on Twitter who must be in early to mid-20s, and they are playing Devil May Cry 3, or the original Silent Hill 2, or Majora's Mask on N64, and then Majora's Mask on 3DS, and there is obviously an audience for that.
I do remember watching a YouTuber who was doing a Nintendo Retrospective about Super Smash Bros, and then he said that his childhood Smash Bros game was Smash Bros for Wii U, and I think I closed the video out of sheer disgust. No one of that age bracket has anything to teach me about Smash Bros. I was there, I was there.
Yeah, that's it. It's interesting, because my interest in retro games only really stretches back as far as things that happened in my lifetime. The idea of being born in 2000, and then you go and play games that came out in the mid-90s is a bit strange to me.
I say that, my little brother has absorbed all the same game tastes that I have. So he was born in 1998, and he has played all of the early Final Fantasy games. He's the only person I know has completed Final Fantasy 5, for example.
So yeah, maybe I just have a different reading on this. So is the pile of shame a modern concept, or do you think we are already fresh to it because we're millennials and have disposable income? What do you think about this?
I don't know. I feel like when games were coming of age, they weren't necessarily speaking to adults who had all the money to buy 50 PS1 games a year. I think our generation has bought that love and appetite with us.
So it feels like a more modern thing. I also think when you're talking about older consoles, probably 360 is probably just in because Xbox are better at it. But there was a sense of games being contained to a console generation.
Once you moved on with the console generation, you didn't really go back, at least. That's how it was anecdotally in all my social circles. We all loved the N64.
Second, the GameCube came out. We stopped playing the games that we played every day of our lives. Every day of that generation, a Gold Nine Perfect Dark, were just instantly dead to us, even though they didn't have a replacement or anything as good as that on the GameCube.
We were just on and I do think that's the same for a lot of people. Maybe one of the changes, and I think it's in the episode plan for a bit later, is this generations not really existing anymore, console shifting towards more of a PC model, the platform holders being better at backwards compatibility or bringing your games with you, them being digital libraries. I feel like that empowers people to start building a pile of shame in a way that I just don't think you would have before.
You certainly didn't hear it talked about, it wasn't in magazines or sites. I didn't feel like gamers who were 15 years older than me, who were writing the magazines at the time, were amassing huge piles of things and worrying about them. So I don't know, it feels more modern to me.
It feels more modern in the sense as well that it's that kind of like crunch on our time that happens with all media now, whether it's TV or movies to some extent, but definitely TV or like, yeah, like Jay says, literature is quite a good comparison because like he says, there's like, that it's bleak but they take thousands of punts a year, hoping that they'll have like one or two. The Sarah, is it Sarah J. Mass type breakouts, where everyone buys the horny fantasy literature and it keeps the entire operation afloat.
And yeah, it's just you are just surrounded by media. Everyone has too much media to consume at all times. And games are just one part of that.
I do personally think that this probably started when games transitioned more to CD based media in the 90s because it became cheaper to accumulate things. And you got the platinum range of PS1 games, for example. That is a different relationship with your game collection than I think you have with the SNES or N64 collection of cartridges.
But not to the same degree. And certainly like you say, I also don't really ever remember this being discussed in the first few years of me working in games media. I feel like this is the last 10 years phenomenon in particular, maybe last 15.
But again, as Jay says, operating on pure vibes over here. But that's fine. So I suppose that the time element of this I mentioned, how much of this backlogged in the moment is a result of game publishers fighting for your time as much as your money?
And how much of it is linked to the rise of open world games and other time sinks that occurred during the 360 and PS4 era, Jay?
So I think, again, this kind of ties a lot back into what we were talking about last time. Everything's very kind of interwoven in a way. I feel like you get to this point where you jump to HD and suddenly games cost 10 times as much, but you're selling them for approximately the same amount of money.
So publishers and game developers started investing into exploring player retention as a concept, player retention features, which can manifest in various ways depending on your genre. I mean, when you were talking before about the expansion of how long it took to play a game, it used to be on the PS2 era. Some of these big hit blockbusters would be 10-hour fairs, and then you jump to the HD era, jump to Xbox 360 and you get longer games.
I think one thing that point of data that I thought was quite funny is, how long to beat lists Assassin's Creed 2007 as taking 30 hours, if you want to 100 percent it, and then Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which came 11 years after, takes 144 hours to complete. Everything just got so expensive, so you have to think right. We're investing five times as much to make an Assassin's Creed game as we did last decade.
So now we need to figure out how to keep people playing longer, because it's almost like time and money are interwoven. People want their money's worth out of these products. As a consequence, every big game takes a lot longer.
They're investing so much money into it that it needs to take as long as possible in order to get your money's worth and get the time share's worth. Everyone's competing for time as much as they are for your money. I think it is very much in line with, everyone has to compete with the fact that Skyrim is huge now.
Everyone has to compete with the fact that even in this bracket of bespoke games where you pay once for it, this niche part of the medium where you buy a game, some of those games are huge now. So even games that don't have to necessarily fit that big multiplayer open world kind of, all the tent poles that would make your game like an evergreen long-lived title, they have to figure out ways to make your time worthwhile with those games essentially.
Yeah. It's not really indicative of anything, but I was watching the, on Friday people were talking about player numbers of Dragon Age, for example, and I noticed it was one slot above Baldur's Gate 3 in the Steam Most Play charts. It was just really interesting to note that their competition was a game that more than a year old and had been in early access for a lot longer than that.
Just how, yeah, that is just such a real factor there. The competition never really goes away if a game has enough cultural cache and sticks around. It just suddenly became an ordeal to finish more than five blockbusters a year.
I think that it used to be a bit more like you could blast through a game in a weekend. I always use Mirror's Edge and Dead Space as examples, because they're perfect. You can complete it from a Friday night to a Sunday evening, if you just put in the time and they are a particular generation of EA game that people liked and people talked about for a long time.
They're the kinds of games that don't quite exist in the same form anymore. Matthew, what do you think? How much of this is time versus money?
Yeah, I definitely see the genre of things you're talking about in terms of the rise of the Ubisoft map game and other publishers' equivalents, you know, the rise of, yeah, live service games. You know, I remember the bad old days of 360, where publishers were still finding their feet in retention and were doing all kinds of mad bollocks, like the one-time only game code to stop you from, like, trading things in or buying pre-owned games. Remember they were doing that?
It was like this mode to unlock it, it came with a code, and then if you traded it in, obviously you'd sell that game without that mode because you couldn't claim the code a second time, and people shoehorning multiplayer modes into single-player games because they just figured, well, if you play the multiplayer forever, you won't trade it in and will only sell new copies. So, you know, that's definitely played on their minds. I think, like Nintendo, have always been a kind of a weird part of this, in that, you know, Oata was very, very hot on, you know, We Are Competing For Time.
Like, I think he was, you know, one of the platform holders who I heard talking about that earliest as part of, like, GDC Keynotes and whatever, was kind of like, we're competing with the TV, and that's why the Wii U is what the Wii U was, because they thought, you know, we're going to have this thing which is like half, half TV, half games console, and that way we don't have to compete. We can kind of be a hybrid of it. But the actual games themselves, I'd argue, don't necessarily have the kind of hallmarks of a company that is like aggressively pursuing retention.
You know, they are still very comfortable in the 15 to 20 hour campaign space. You know, they have the forever games just because they're beloved multiplayer games like Smash Brothers and Mario Kart. But you don't see the same kind of manipulation there.
You know, I think they still seem to be going, you know, on the numbers of it. You'd think, oh, they're still kind of competing for money, not time. Even though they definitely said otherwise.
The games being like deliberately stickier, not just in the sense of how long they take to play, but also how easily available they are is like a key thing. So, back in the day, while you could find like Deus Ex or Far Cry in the sold out range in any UK game shop or even like a blockbuster or something, you didn't carry your library with you quite as persistently. And obviously digital sales feed into that.
Like I say, games are always being kind of remastered as well. And Assassin's Creed Odyssey that Jay mentions is a good example of how games increase in length, but an example of a game that hasn't really increased in like the length of its single player story option, but has been forever updated with new stuff to do. GTA V.
So was anyone playing San Andreas once they upgraded to a 360 or PS3 in like 2006 or 2007? I really don't remember people talking about it that much. Even like GTA IV, I feel like people played that.
By the time Red Dead Redemption came out in 2010, I don't think that GTA IV was like really being persistently played or discussed. And then take GTA V by contrast. It has native versions on three different hardware platforms.
It's still the one Rockstar wants you to buy after 11 years. And I imagine that GTA V and GTA VI might come out next year, but if it doesn't, they'll still want you to keep playing GTA V. It's just viewed so differently how it's packaged to you and how it's repackaged to you.
It's just a different world. And I think like you say, Jay, the outlay, the amount it costs to make GTA V versus GTA IV is probably a key part of it, but also just like the money you can make back is potentially huge. So yeah, the key thing I want to ask off the back of this was that time squeeze.
What threat do you think Backloggeddon poses to game developers more generally? And it do keep saying Backloggeddon like it's an actual like...
If we say it enough, we can establish it.
It's a bit day to day, isn't it?
We can monetize this somehow.
Yeah, it is a little bit. I want to know who stands to lose the most because I saw another interesting thread over the weekend that said that the number of games that had 100,000 wish lists on Steam and therefore by conventional metrics would likely sell about 10,000 copies when they release. Was still a tiny portion of the thousands of games that released on Steam every year, and therefore the profitability of those games more generally is pretty poor.
Because we tend to hear about success stories more than we hear about stories of people not succeeding, it means that there's a skewed perception of indie games are absolutely thriving, where other parts of the games maybe are struggling. But it seems like in general, we do all have too many games, and it is maybe a problem. But what do you think, Jay?
One thought I keep having when we've been discussing about games from 10, 15 years ago, and even examples like GTA, and when Matthew was saying once the GameCube came out, everyone ditched the N64 because the jump. I think there is something to be said about playing like TimeSplitters, Future Perfect, and the GameCube just felt like technologically like so far ahead of what you could do in GoldenEye. I think a key word here is do.
I think there's something to be said, especially in like a triple A level, is one thing that hasn't changed in the last 15 years is like, okay, what do you do in these games? It hasn't changed very much since the HD era. What like the scope of gameplay and the actions, and people talk about like when you break down game design, you talk about like verbs and things.
One thing that stuck out to me is I was watching preview footage of Star Wars Outlaws before that was coming out. Great visual representation of like the Star Wars world. Extremely convincing, all the iconography and the music is there.
But I remember watching the gameplay and thinking what you're actually doing in the game is no different to like the gameplay from like Gears of War or some mass effect. Kind of like, okay, you're ultimately doing over-the-shoulder third-person shooter combat. You can shoot the barrels and blow up some enemies and stuff.
It's almost like we've hit like a stagnation in what you do in games and that hasn't shifted in a long time, which makes going back to older games easier because like the amount of gameplay expression within games from like the HD era onwards, hasn't changed that much, I feel. I don't know if either of you have a feeling like that kind of sense, but like I think once you jumped to the twin stick HD online shooter games, things didn't change dramatically in terms of what you could actually do in games. They looked a lot prettier, but ultimately like gameplay-wise hasn't shifted.
I've seen some gameplay designers and game designers in the industry kind of discuss the idea that kind of we've kind of excised the full scope of technological innovation and kind of like narrative innovation is going to be the next frontier for games. But I think so far, at least in this AAA space that we see, no one is jumping to getting really experimental with narrative game design and how you interact with it just yet. I do have the sense that maybe part of the reason no one's jumping to new stuff is outside, if you're not that into the flashiness of how games look now, things from 15 years ago don't play that much worse than stuff now.
I don't know if either of you feel that.
I think definitely you get that sense with when you think about how third-person action and climbing is, and platforming, that kind of stuff exists somewhere. Even third-person combat, like melee combat, there's basically a range between Assassin's Creed and Elden Ring, and your game is going to be in there if you are flirting with that particular game type, or if you're making a third-person shooter, then Gears of War made in 2006 is going to be your template, and first-person shooters, arguably Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the first one, in 2007, kind of perfected a lot of the sort of like basics in terms of athleticism and aiming down sights and the overall feel of the game. Yeah, I think there is something in that, and actually, I had to be reminded of how people used to have different solutions for how you did things in games.
When I was playing Youth 050 at the weekend, and I played a game called Mooncat, which is a whole game basically of like, fuck you, look at these controls, like this game is an absolute nightmare to play. But then remembering that games did used to be like that, that you did used to be confronted with a different way of doing platforming where you had to think a bit laterally about how to use the controls or the way that you played it was just, there was no established template for how you did the thing. And therefore, yeah, it was, there was more scope to do things a bit differently and that has disappeared, I think.
Yeah. Matthew, what do you think?
Yeah, I guess that kind of does tie into it in the idea that like, you know, if Backlageddon stems from in part like a kind of soupiness in terms of, you know, ideas that, you know, haven't changed, you know, there isn't a kind of, if the key part of it is that there aren't clean breaks anymore, you know, whether that's console generations or big leaps in how games are sort of technologically achieved and mechanically achieved, then if people feel like they're slave to the accepted conventions, that's when it does become a problem, you know, like the idea that this is what, you know, that you're competing for this smaller part of like the new purchase pie, you know, that's obviously a thing and the financial concern, but that also feels like it is as it ever was, That's just good old-fashioned kind of competition issues. But the idea that there is now a sort of ratified idea of like, this is what games are, and because of that, you can't really leave that space without taking huge risks. That isn't Bacla-
Oh, for fuck's sake. That isn't Baclageddon's fault, but it's kind of like certainly adjacent.
Yeah. I think as well it speaks to why something like Elden Ring has succeeded, where yes, like you might recognize its particular style of combat, and even its exploration from other games. They might remind you of things you've played before, and in the case of From Games, there is a lineage that they are inspired by the games, where they have created their own kind of combat dynamic that has persisted throughout all of their different games.
Then Elden Ring is also unknowable in all these different ways, and does not play nice with you. I think that just being unsettled a little bit is part of why it's been such a huge success, even if the basics you might understand.
But I would definitely say that the kind of the Souls-like is in the last 15 years, it is one of the gameplay leap, not leaps, but like changes. It's a huge, it's a different kind of template that emerged. People are really into it, and maybe what they're responding to is, oh, this is fresh and different.
I feel like the games that are in kind of contention for like kind of greatest all-time categories are often the ones which have those leaps. I mean, not that like, edges like the arbiter of these things, but like the Edge 10s. You know, when people are surprised that, you know, when I think of an Edge 10, for example, you know, my short cut, my quick go-to is, oh, it moves the genre on in some way, you know, is what it kind of traditionally was.
And those are quite few and far between, especially in an age where, you know, you do have these such sort of established norms and everyone's quite happy kind of playing in those spaces. But like in the last 15 years, it probably kind of is Dark Souls, Demon Souls, probably like Breath of the Wild in terms of like open world, like rule book rewriting. But like, you know, and I imagine there's, you know, there's a case to be made for like, well, like a Minecraft or online stuff, which I'm not as familiar with.
So I never feel as comfortable talking about that. But yeah, I don't know if this was going anywhere. But yes, but, but, but, you know, I feel like when, when people do, do substantially shift something successfully, they are rewarded by almost being like instantly immortalized.
Yeah. And there's like the reverse problem that's happened where other people have taken the souls, like mechanics have made too many of them.
Yeah.
And so we're kind of like, you know, if we, if we talk about, if we say that like backlog ending is partly tied to, we have, we all have too many of the same type of game to play, whether it's like a third person game with like an open world, or a bunch of first person shooters you've maybe not played through, or you know, just something that eats up like a lot of time. I think that like souls likes are definitely part of the, the problem of like every single one of them is like 30 to 40 hours long. There's a lot of commonality between like the art direction of these games as well.
Some of them have extraordinarily rendered like the Lies of P and the Lords of the Fallen game that came out either last year or a couple of years ago. Really nice looking versions of something that you have, you have seen before or like a different spin on something you have seen before. But like every year there are more and more of those games that surely no one has any time to get through all of them.
And you know, those people who do won't play anything else. And so I do think that's part of the backlog and the problem too is that like there are maybe like Jay says, just a very few established ways of doing things now. And so it feels like you've got a lot of the same, everyone's got a lot of the same thing to kind of clear through.
Jay, I don't have any further thoughts on that. I did also, I did also, I hope you don't mind me bringing this up, but you mentioned that you already know what that Wolverine game is that's coming out on PS5. You saw it, you're like, yeah, I know what that is.
I know exactly what that combat is going to feel like. I know what that experience is going to be.
Spiritually, I've already beaten Insomniac Wolverine in my head and in my heart.
Terrible for those devs that so much of it leaked and that it like massive completed or near complete looking portions of it leaked. Absolutely.
But I don't even want to say that in a besmirching way. I mean, I'm sure it'll be a really good game. I don't think that's necessarily a negative to say like, I can see that and I can imagine playing that in my head.
I think it's more just a case of how I guess I personally like interface with games and what I want out of games maybe has shifted in response to just having access to so much of it. Another thing you mentioned as well, sorry, Samuel, is kind of if you feel if I felt like this kind of indie games and stuff as well. I think indie games are in a very kind of interesting place with this.
I know with the original article that kind of began this conversation, it was kind of in response to this game Arco, that by all means in previous years would have done well on Steam, but was kind of getting eaten up by the just immense amount of competition and noise around games. I remember feeling so differently about how the indie game industry felt to kind of be in and kind of be exposed to about 10 years ago. So when I think about 2014, so exactly 10 years ago, you had a year when like Transistor and Crypt of the Necrodancer and Shovel Knight came out and then like a couple more.
And it's like, okay, you could play all of those games in that year very easily. These were not necessarily long games. They weren't very expensive.
It was very kind of affordable and viable in terms of time to kind of keep up with indie games as like a culture. And I think that made it quite an exciting time. There was a lot of buzz around indie games around this time, you know, this was getting towards 10 years out of, you know, Xbox Live Arcade.
Minecraft and Terraria had come out and kind of like broken everything and changed everything in a lot of ways. And it was kind of a very exciting time. I think everything that kind of came out and was good did pretty well.
And if you also have that feeling of what things were like for indie games like around that time.
I even think it's like slightly earlier than that, that it became easy to play all the canon indies. I think about how in 2013 you had like Gunpoint and like Gone Home and the Stanley Parable. And it seemed like every big thing you could kind of tick off.
And then, yeah, I do think that probably does last for like two to three more years. And then certainly in the last like seven or eight years, it's become impossible to play all of them. So yeah, it's interesting.
I was curious, does that spook you as a developer, Jay? Because I imagine you spend a lot of your time thinking about this.
Oh yeah, I mean, when you look at the games that I listed, it was like, okay, you could sell, you could make a lot of money on like a pixel art game back then. And that's like, as someone who does pixel art, it's quite worrying to look at the trends and be like, see a big line going down and be like, ooh. I think what indie games are has changed.
I think because of this era of like, severe, like, incredible success and popularity and just the sheer hit rate, you know, you had the boom of like indie publishers. This is the, these are the kind of fires in which like, you know, like devolver were forged. You know, here's something cool in pixel art and that feels a little bit counterculture.
You've got an instant hit on your hands and it cost very little to produce and, you know, players are okay with like a low-fi graphical style. When I think about what indie games are now, I'm actually just kind of describing like double A games, you know what I mean? It's like an indie game now will be like full 3D and have a team of 20 people on it.
And maybe it'll be shorter. It'll be as short as the triple A games were that we were describing on the PS2 era, but it will look very good. I don't know if a Crypt of the Necrodancer or a Shovel Knight or a Gone Home would sell today.
It's kind of almost like useless to say that because the market of today only exists because of hits like that. But if you were to kind of recreate the conditions that made those games then, now, I'm not convinced that they would hit in the same way. I think to an extent, it's almost like this is another vibes-based analysis.
But it feels like when there's a culture that you can keep up with, it's much more appealing to keep up with it. And then maybe when it just hits that tipping point of there's just too many indie games, suddenly your appetite for any indie games just drops off the radar. Because there's not this feeling of keeping up with the culture, like a particular subculture of games.
And if you can't keep up with all the kind of indies, if you're only just playing a few that appeal to you, then it's just falling back into what AAA games are, a market where you see something that appeals to you and you play it. And that makes it a harder sell for indies because they don't look as impressive. You know what I mean?
Yeah, absolutely. One of the reasons I think I've gotten big into films the last few years is because that's quite a linear culture to keep up with. And most people can see all the same things, you might be in a town that has an Odeon and doesn't show fucking Strange Darling or something, something that a bit more obscure that people are talking about.
But generally speaking, most people can access most films. Within like three months from coming out of the cinema, you'll have some way to watch it at home. And you can have a film culture and everyone can be watching the same stuff.
And in games, it's all about what kind of year did you have out of the mountain of stuff that came out. It's very different in that respect. I don't even think TV has contracted enough to the point where you can pretty much watch all of the good TV shows and it's like doable.
In games, that is absolutely not the case and has not been the case for a long time. And so that really is a key reason why we're in the middle of backloggedon as a thing. And I do think there's probably something in the idea that like the current moment of industry contraction that can be linked to that.
We all have too many games to play, whether it's a 50-hour RPG or five untouched shikusa games or a live service game you've been meaning to check out, but it's had like 10 updates and an expansion. We all just have too much of everything, which is why I wanted to end this by asking, what is the cure for backloggedon? I don't mean like industry-wide because I think that's kind of got to resolve itself.
I think part of it, honestly, is in having some shorter games to play. So I think the reason that people went really like Space Marine 2 is because eight hours long and you get eight really good hours out of that for your money. And then if you want to keep playing, they've got a co-op mode that scales up and has its own progression system and lots of different things to play, new tyrannids to blow up.
They keep patching those in. So I think people went crazy for that because it was that length and it was like 50 quid and it felt like a really easy proposition to people. For us as human beings, what is the cure for backlog end?
Do we all have to make peace with the fact we'll never finish all the games in our collection that we want to play before we die? What do you think, Jay?
You could just play the first half of everything and then just ditch it. That's a really viable solution. I'm not going to see the end of Baldur's Gate 3, even though I think it's one of the most amazing things I've played over the last five years.
But that's okay. I think if you throw in a big second-axe boss fight and you get to that. No, I think, again, it's almost like the mindset has to...
I think people's mindsets are shifting from the mentality of you have to keep up with everything that's coming out. I think people are making peace with the fact that there's some big titles and stuff. Games have always come out at a faster rate than you've been able to beat them.
I think we're just reaching a much more extreme point of like there's more games than ever coming out and they're all much longer when you don't have time for like any of them and you've got bills to pay and all that. I can see as a consequence why this is causing people to fall back on like having the one multiplayer thing they drop back into, they'll jump back into Minecraft after years out and things like that. I'm sure we'll see more of that kind of approach to games of being like you have the one or two evergreen titles you just kind of dip your toes back into.
And then when it otherwise, I mean, people will always have like the franchises that they follow, you know, I'm always going to be gunning for like the next Metroid game, even though I barely touched Metroid Prime Remastered, despite being very excited for it. Again, another victim of Backloggeddon. Unicorn Overlord is like maybe peak Backloggeddon for me.
Something that theoretically is very enjoyable, but I know my ass is never seeing the credits on that.
I think the entire sort of gameography of Vanillaware is a victim of Backloggeddon for me.
Which is sad, because I do think 13 Sentinels is a... I'm pretty ride or die for it.
Yeah, it would be very enriching experience for me if I dug into it. But yeah, I do think there's a certain amount of reaching an age where you're like, I'm going to make a piece of the fact that I'm only going to get through X amount of these things and then being selective about what those things are, and picking things that you think might be meaningful to you. So Matthew, I will ask you about this in a second, so be prepared.
But for example, Red Dead Redemption 2 is something I know I need to play and finish, because I've played enough of it to know that I want to finish it, but also just the way people continuously talk about it. In my head, I've made a value judgment that it's more important for me to see the end of that than it is to see the end of Horizon Forbidden West, for example, which I feel like there's things about that I think I would really enjoy as well in terms of how nice the world looks and the US element of that setting and that kind of stuff. But yeah, it's more just like there's a finite amount of time on the planet.
There's also a bunch of retro games I would still like to finish. I've been playing Final Fantasy 6 this year. That's been a really enriching experience.
And those games are not as long where you can whack on a four times experience, a multiplier, for example. And then you can steam roll of the game a little bit faster. And there's PS1 shoot-em-ups I'd still like to play.
I'd like to play G Darius. Will I ever get to it? I'm not sure.
But I'm always making little lists in my head of things I'd like to play, things that I know I need to play. I think it's also about accepting there are some things you'll just never play. Like, I don't think I'm ever going to play the first two Baldur's Gate games in their extended edition forms, for example.
I'd like to have done so. What I actually needed to do was go to my blockbusting gospel when I was 10 years old. And buy, well, actually more like 15, buy Baldur's Gate for $4.99 from the sold out collection and play it then, when I had nothing but fucking time on my hands.
But it's not going to happen now and that's okay.
There is a third option here, which is watch a two hour YouTube video called like Grandia Retrospective, where someone claims it's a review in retrospective, but actually just explains the plot beat by beat with gameplay footage. And therefore, you've kind of like fast-tracked the vague experience of what it would have been like to play Grandia on the Dreamcast.
Yeah.
And then you can tell yourself, like when someone says, like, have you played that? It kind of blends into your memory and you're not quite, you can no longer remember if you actually have ever experienced Grandia. And you say, yeah, I know Grandia.
That's the other option.
So much of my video game knowledge is based on demo discs I played from the years like 1997 to 2004. So yeah, it's important work they're doing for sure. But I do think that dealing with Backlog Eden is all about being reasonable with yourself and sometimes it's okay to replay things for comfort too.
You're not on a fucking treadmill to play as many things as you can before you die. Playing new games, experiencing new games, but also making sure that your love of games is intact and doesn't ever feel like a job in itself. Matthew, what do you think?
Backlog Eden, what is the cure?
Well, I think listening to this podcast and listening to us wrestle with our backlogs and highlighting things which do stand up to replaying and things that we can return to. Self-serving, joke aside, I think that is part of the appeal of a podcast like this, and I think it is a good service. Finding curators who can steer you to the good shit, that's important, and just finding someone who is on the same wavelength as you, who can help you through your backlog.
I personally don't think there's… there's no shame in… If something has to be played, if you're genuinely loving it, you'll know, you'll know that you have to do it, and that may sound quite trite, but there's so much stuff where I pick it up and I'm like, nah, you know, and that's absolutely fine.
It's… You don't owe, you don't owe the game, you know, unless you've spent, you've just spent 70 quid on it. I imagine that would smart a bit, but you can just return that.
But the idea of feeling like you, you're kind of slave to a game, I think is, it's kind of mad. I guess…
Metaphor playthrough going, Matthew.
Yeah. Well, that's, you see, that's, yeah, that's a weird one in that I've just, I've played so much of it that I just may, you know, it will have been a waste of whatever, 60 hours if I don't finish it. Yeah.
And I just want to see it through to the end so I can just, like, you know, put a full stop on it and go, yes, 100%, that is an eight out of 10. Just so I know, because there's a chance, like, if it really sticks to the landing, maybe that's what people were responding to when they gave it a 10, because they wouldn't have come to that conclusion if they stopped it where I stopped it. So, there's that, but I think, like, you know, the most obvious bit of advice with All Things Backlog is to just try and find, like, half an hour an hour just to try something and see if it does instantly get its hooks into you, because I find there's lots of stuff where you just, you think, oh god, I don't really want to play that or whatever, and then you do, and then you're like, oh yeah, this makes sense.
Like, I had a bit of that with Bellatro. When everyone was talking about Bellatro, I was like, oh fuck it, I don't really have time to do this. I don't really want to do that.
But you pick it up and you're like, oh yeah, this is obviously Ace and it completely makes sense. And I found that with a lot of classic film as well. There's stuff you're like, oh, do I really want to watch that?
It's just so worthy. You know, it's like, that can't be entertaining. That can't possibly be good.
And if it is good, it will have you in like 10 minutes or whatever. And yeah, I just think that's, you know, practically, just like trying these things does help. And I think the things you have to play are pretty obvious from that and having no shame in dumping them.
And yeah, that may just mean you end up replaying, you know, God of War 3 over and over again. But that's OK. That's like we've endorsed that on this podcast.
I think two of the games that are going to be my top 10 this year are games that I had to challenge myself to play properly to understand if I did like them or not. And I did have that question in my head of like, well, maybe I just bounce to some indie game and play that and maybe that will be the one I love and that will get me to my top 10 for the episode this year. But then I just settled in, bedded into it.
Games have taken over, a couple of games have taken over, like a month of my spare time this year and it's been good. Just let it happen. And then that is the most fulfilling way to enjoy a game, I think, to just give it the time and breathing space it deserves to enjoy it and to not fret about the backlog.
The backlog is, it's all in the mind, you know? All your games are out there on the cloud. They are not in your, in most cases, they're not in your flat with you or your house with you.
They are elsewhere. They exist digitally. They are, don't be haunted by them.
That's a weird note to end this on.
The crumbling ruin of your backlog can be escaped into the techno-optimist city of Megalopolis, which is to not care about things and play five hours of every game.
Yes, good advice. Matthew, do you have another thing to say there?
I was just going to say another solution for backloggeddon is to just be, if you are a Nintendo fan and if you only owned a Switch, I think you could play most of the big first party releases and that would fill your ear quite comfortably. They are compelling enough to drag you through. I think Nintendo games are quite easy hangs.
Definitely. There is always at least one or two great ones a year, and then one or two mid ones a year, and then one or two remasters, which you probably already know if you like them. It's quite comfortable rhythm to settle into it.
Okay. Matthew is saying, abandon all other platforms and Nintendo will sort you out, which is actually not necessarily bad advice. Fair play.
Okay. I think we just about landed on the plane on this episode, lads. So that's good.
Jay, it's been a pleasure having you back on the podcast. So where can people find you on social media?
I'm on Blue Sky now. I guess if we're all still trying to jump to that, I guess by the time this podcast comes out, it will be clear about what's happening with Twitter, but we'll deal with that in the future. Yeah, I'm on Twitter and on Blue Sky.
Do you have to give it your full, there's the.bsky.social and all that.
Yeah, people can find you on there.
Certainly Jay Baylis on Blue Sky and I'm also on Twitter.
It was very exciting for me recently, because Jay followed me back on Blue Sky after I followed him about six months ago, as he locked in for the first time in six months to see what was going on on there. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
You can find me on Twitter at MrBazzill UnderscorePesto, rolling my eyes at the people who come over from Blue Sky to be like, hey everyone, remember that I'm on Blue Sky, because they have a bigger following on Twitter and they're feeling a bit lonely on Blue Sky. So if you want to go to Blue Sky, fuck off and stay on Blue Sky, all right? You don't have to keep going back here and stinking up the joint.
Anyway, side note, I am also on Blue Sky. MrBazzillPesto, no underscore. But I do exclusive content on both, so it's pretty good.
I like it. I like your Blue Sky content because there's a little whiff of like, I don't want to be here, but well, I am here, I will perform for you. That's like the vibe I get from you on there, which is good vibes frankly.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on all social media platforms. Contrary to what Matthew's mum thinks, I do like him.
And don't, all my episode 200 Barb's were made in, were made with love. It was all in jest. This podcast can be supported at patreon.com/backpagepod.
If you'd like two additional podcasts a month, we can sort you out. We're doing two giant men playing Metal Gear Solid this month. You can get this on the Monday after this episode goes live.
So hear us talk about an old game that Matthew's been playing while he's got the flu. That'll be good. And yes, backpagepod on Twitter as well.
If you'd like to follow the podcast, we're also on BlueSky BackpagePod too. You can now post video clips. So pretty much everything we do on Twitter, you can get on BlueSky as well if you'd like to.
That is everything. Goodbye.
