Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, welcome to 2025, or at least when this goes live, it's 2025. How was your break over the holidays?
It was good. A little bit of to-ing and fro-ing, but we ended with a nice stretch of staying at home, watching TV and playing video games, which cover the games in what we've been playing. But I haven't really left the house, so I haven't got any snacking or film anecdotes for you or anything like that.
I'm going to see Better Man today, which we already discussed on the XXL pod. Looking forward to that. I saw the film The Order yesterday with Jude Law.
That's meant to be good, right?
Yeah, I don't think it was good at all. I thought it was incredibly boring. I've started to second-guess Nicholas Holt a little bit, because he's meant to be this very charismatic cult leader in it.
I felt like this could have been the role of a lifetime, but he was so flat in it. He didn't have that vibe at all. But there's some stuff I've seen him in, where he's a perfect fit for it, like the favorite.
But in this, I didn't think he quite had the juice, unfortunately.
Oh, dear. So you wouldn't be joining his cult?
No, I wouldn't be. Certainly not. They're white supremacists.
Oh, yeah, sorry. I forgot that.
But you never really see them do any white supremacist stuff in the film. And it's sort of like, I mean, it is to tell you alone that they are white supremacists. Obviously, you know, you know they are the villains.
But it's also a thing of the film lacks a little bit of context there. It feels a bit, oh yeah, these guys, these blokes here, they're white supremacists, and they're just doing some robberies on some armored trucks. And that's all they really do.
I honestly thought it was really disappointing. The reviews were way out of whack. So that's Big Sammy's first film recommendation, well, or not, of the year.
Yeah.
I saw that. My break was good. Thank you for asking.
Yeah, I was going to ask.
I spent it, it's weird because my Christmas break still resemble what they did 17 years ago. It's me and my brother, my mum and my dad. But I think it feels a slightly more melancholy these days because there's that feeling of, oh, we probably aren't going to have that many more of these, because just in the sense of your parents reach a certain age and at some point you'll have partners and you won't all be there.
I've had Christmases with partners before, but I don't know. There was a tiny tinge of that to it.
Interesting.
But also lots of delights. I've been playing the Star Wars Battlefront Classics Collection with my little brother, and it was us and AI versus each other. He was so angry after our last game on Hoth, that I completely fucking broke his brain, because they added this mode where you can basically, I think it triples the number of AI troops who are on the battlefield.
So it's a proper sort of like, I think they're like, oh, well, you're not playing on PS2 anymore, so here's all the PS5 power, have fun. I just parked my AT-AT outside his base, where about 20 rebels were spawning every minute, and just killed every single one of them as they came out, including him. He was so furious, he couldn't do anything about this.
That was the last game we played, and then when he saw me do a Blue Sky post about this very instance, he was absolutely livid, and challenging me to a rematch constantly in the two days before I left. I was like, nope, nope, let's leave it there, let's leave it there.
Retire the champion.
Exactly, a classic Robert's family memory there, that's been forged in the fires. I didn't take any gaming handhelds apart from the naughty Olderboy device, the Anbernic device, and just played Einhander and R-Type Delta on it, and that's all I played for the week I was away. Those games are really fucking good, by the way, but only if you've got save states.
I don't think I would have got to the end of Einhander without using save states about 800 times.
I was gonna say, I've been impressed by the first level of lots of legendary shooting games.
Yeah, it is like that, and it's sort of that thing of, well, you didn't take the time to learn it or whatever. But I think these games assume a reality where I don't play anything else for a year. But obviously, I play loads of stuff.
So I feel like I know these games inside and out because I've gone through the same bits hundreds of times, but I've just done it without actually restarting each level every single time, which I know Pyrus will probably shake the heads at. But for 36-year-old Big Sammy in 2024, it doesn't seem like the worst crime in the world. So those are damn good games, though, really, really good.
Okay, so, predictions. We need a lighter episode to kick off the year, because we just did about fucking eight three-hour podcasts in a row. So here it is, 2025 predictions.
They are never based on any real Intel. We are not sort of like hooked up industry insiders. We do not want to be on gaming leaks and rumors subreddit at any point, and we know nothing at all.
So don't worry, though, because there are loads of journalists who do want to be there. So it's fine, they'll keep you fed.
So yes, we have 25 predictions. I've done 13, Matthew's done 12, and we'll talk about those very briefly, though. We're not going to do the whole list because that might take up a whole episode, Matthew.
But from last year's predictions, what did you get right?
Very little. I'm really bad at this prediction thing that we do every year.
Me too, me too.
I wouldn't say I dread it, but I do struggle to nail the tone because the first time we did it, I came across as a bit of sort of analyst-y, I think. You know, it was like, Netflix are gonna dominate. And then you were just like, Donkey Kong is gonna have a new hat.
It felt like, oh, okay, I've misjudged the tone and I've been sort of not quite nailing it ever since.
A gross and accurate distillation of what that episode was like, yeah.
So what did I get right? We'll get a full Astro Bot game.
Yeah, I got that one too.
Yeah, we both got that. We did get it and what a great 8 out of 10 it was.
Yeah, well, you know, like almost everything else on those two top 10 lists, it was a great 8 out of 10.
I think it was an 8 this year. That was very good. Best platformer of 2024.
Unless you count Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown.
Oh, yeah. No, yes.
Up to you though. Metroidvania, who fucking knows? Genres in it.
So I said that we'd get a game from Tetsuo Takahashi, that's Mr. Xenoblade revived from his past. Thinking in my head that we might finally get Xenogears is what I was hankering for. But they did announce Xenoblade Chronicles X, so I'm not technically wrong.
That's a good one. I think that that was a good call. Because yes, Xenoblade Chronicles X did seem very unlikely.
And the best case scenario with these predictions is that you can reverse into some mild success when one cool thing happens. And that's what you did. So well done.
So here's a bit more reversing. I said Square Enix will give us a second batch of remakes of Dragon Quest for 4, 5 and 6, that they'd get the 25D remake treatment. They didn't do that, but they did announce 25D remakes of 1 and 2.
So I was kind of, I was sort of in the right area. There was more Dragon Quest to come after 3.
Did those already exist though as a thing they were going to do? Or was it always just 3 they were doing?
No, I double checked, they did get announced in the summer.
Okay, fair play.
When they announced the release date of the 3 HD 2.5 thing, they were like, oh, and by the way, and I was like, yes, here's 1 and 2. And then I was less, yes, because those games are quite old and quite creaky underneath those glorious new visuals. So, oh well, we live in hope.
Indeed, indeed. Well, that's a decent crop of those, all your successful ones, Matthew.
A lot of mine was Switch 2 related, which didn't come true, but aren't technically proved wrong yet either. But the one that related to it most directly was that Switch 2 will launch, which obviously didn't happen, with the same form factor as Switch 1, which I think now has sort of largely been confirmed through leaks that it is just going to look like the Switch 1, except probably with magnetic Joy-Cons instead of clicky Joy-Cons. Yeah, I've seen over the holidays, people have started like 3D printing Switch 2s based on leak diagrams of it from factories or something, which feels like a pretty big leak, if that is true.
Also, what's the point? You've created a shell of something that you can just buy in six months, whatever.
Is that the modern version of getting a shit render commissioned for your cover when you're trying to come up with the next Wii U, or here's what the PS4 could look like? Is that what we do now instead, we 3D print things?
Well, there's so much desperation to get clout for leaks and rumours that someone's gone to the lengths of physically building the thing that someone else has leaked so that they can kind of trump them and become the the clout leaker of the day. I mean, surely there's got to be better things to do with your life than that. My big concern with the Switch 2 is this magnet's thing that it won't make a nice clicking sound anymore and that was always quite a fun part of the Switch and the Switch's marketing was the click of the Switch.
Are they going to have a different sound of it? That's what I want to know in 2025.
Okay, well we're getting ahead of ourselves a tiny bit because we've definitely got some Switch 2 chatter to be done. But I too would like to hear the click return Matthew, you're not wrong there.
Magnets just don't have a sound associated with them.
No, but then maybe once it hits, maybe it does a click sound because of the way it locks into the system. It's sort of like little flaps on the side or something. God, I hate the word flaps.
Sorry.
What did you get right?
Yeah, I got about the same number correct, which is to say about 10%, 20% correct. I had my full prediction was Death Stranding 2 is the big Sony exclusive, along with a full sequel to Astro's Playroom. Ghost of Tsushima 2 is also announced this year.
2 out of 3 ain't bad.
Yeah, that's good.
Death Stranding 2 feels like it's probably going to be a next year or this year when you're listening to this game. So not too far off there. This was slightly wrong, but did have one correct thing in it.
Metroid gets its own Nintendo Direct this year with a full unveiling of Metroid Prime 4, as well as the news that Metroid Dread 2 is in the works from our guys at Mercury Steam. Again, 1 out of 2 ain't bad. We got a Metroid Prime 4 announced last year, so that's good.
All the rest of them weren't correct, Matthew. So what did you get wrong?
A lot of them were kind of boring, so I just picked the fun ones, okay?
Yeah, that's fine. Actually, I've got one more I forgot to chuck in. This is a bit of a vaguer one, but I think it kind of works.
People will bang on all year about how this is a quieter year for games in 2023 and we'll all be sick of talking about it. I think by the end, anytime someone said this was a bad year for games or there were no standouts, which happened a couple of times at the Discord, I just wanted to basically burn everything down because there were loads of good games to play. There were no 10s, I think we agreed on the Game of the Year episode, but there are still loads of good games.
So yes, but sorry Matthew, please continue.
The more interesting ones that I got wrong, aside from everything else. Nintendo will celebrate 20 years of DS by adding DS games to the Switch Virtual Console. Would have been fun that, but didn't happen.
Yeah.
Unfortunately.
Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero remake revealed. I was surprised there was nothing Resident Evil-y announced last year or even teased, just to keep the train moving because it's been just such a constant presence, I guess between when they were working on Village and Resident Evil 4, it felt like there was always a Resident Evil promotional thing happening for a couple of years. And to go a year without anything, it just feels a little like, oh, okay.
I think that's a good thing. I think it will just let people build up the appetite. Capcom don't need it because all the games they make are bangers now and the big ones seem to sell really well.
That is true. I mean, I certainly wouldn't have predicted that instead of seeing a Resident Evil trailer at the Game Awards, we'd see Onimusha and Akami instead. So, like, if you think I can be blamed for quite conservative thinking there.
I said Nintendo continue their 99 series of battle games with Rhythm Heaven 99. I think that was just needed one more entry entry, to be honest. That obviously didn't happen.
Xbox will revive Tony Hawk's Pro Skater with a 3 and 4 remake. Again, that didn't happen. I think I expected there to be this flood of exciting new Activision things, which didn't really happen.
It was just kind of business as usual, and then quite a good call of duty.
Well, yeah, it was a bit soon probably for that. I mean, the gears on how this stuff gets moving, you'd expect anything like that to be two or three years away if they do it at all.
Yeah, well, that shows how little I know.
Hey, the predictions are not legally binding. We're just simply lads out here saying stuff. This is what most podcasts do all the time.
This is all they do.
This is all they do. We do this once a year, and we hate it.
Oh, that's funny. We would have killed them. Game Awards, just like a render of a skateboard with some punky pop song going oi, oi, oi in the background.
That's all I ask.
Just to get ahead of something, you better not have fucking Hotel Bellatro in your predictions. I promise you. I'm going to be fucking livid.
That was just like a one-off bit. I was just telling you something happened in my head during the Game Awards. There was really no depth to it.
I'm not engaging with Hotel Bellatro as a concept.
It's not a concept.
It's half a concept. Listen, I've said I'm not going to engage with it, but I think it is a concept.
Well, look, I mean, I don't think we should blow all of our PlayStack cache on Hotel Bellatro, which has got big Heaven's Gate or Battlefield Earth energy to me, a sort of expensive disaster.
If I could funnel all my PlayStack cred we might have, which is zero, I should add, it would be I want to be like murdered in a case, the Golden Idol game. That's what I want. I want my-
Oh, that's good.
I want there to be a weird potato-faced person who I know is me. I don't have to say it's me, but I know it's me.
I like the idea of a crime scene where podcasts have killed each other. That's quite a good one and it could be you and me. So you can be in that and I can be a Bellatro Joker, the I Wish You Well card and it gives you a bonus, but then also maybe levels down one of your hands at the same time or something like that.
That might be good. The I Wish You Well.
It's just your face but done up in the Jimbo makeup.
Yeah, but you can't tell it's really me. It's just because I'm just the most generic looking bloke in the world really. So it's sort of like-
Ben Starr dressed up as Jimbo in the trailer and it's quite clearly Ben. I think people could identify him.
Yeah, that's true.
Like, no one's like, was that Sam?
Well, no, I mean, but he's an extremely handsome man who voiced Clive, so, you know, there's a bit of a difference there. But yeah, I wish you well, dog, as a joker would be. Oh, yeah.
But anyway, we don't need to keep talking about that. Hotel Bellator is not happening until 2025. So should some of my wrong Matthews share that?
Oh, I mean, almost everything. Probably, there's a couple I'm going to roll over into this year, actually, because I still think they'll happen. Like you, I have a few things that just weren't, that didn't happen.
I had Nintendo Switch 2 has been revealed last June. That was not correct. I had Nier Automata sequel being revealed, and it's the best Platinum game since Vanquish.
Well, the Platinum situation seems to be a developing one. So I'm not really sure what's happening to Nier now. But I did just see they posted this.
It's now sold nine million copies, Nier Automata. So it still feels like something will happen there. But will Platinum be involved?
Hard to tell. And this is a really wrong one, but it was wishful thinking. The creators of FTL, Fast and Light and Into the Breach subset games unveil a new game and it becomes an immediate game of the year contender.
That still feels like we've got to find out at some point what those two are making next. Yeah. They are brilliant.
So we will see. But there's no rush when two of your games are like the biggest indie successes of the past 10 plus years. So good for them.
And I also incorrectly said that Star Wars Outlaws would slip to 2025. But that's OK because we got the Splinter Cell remake instead. Absolutely incorrect.
I know nothing about the games industry. With that in mind, Matthew, let's move on to the new predictions.
Assassin's Creed slipped to 2025.
Yeah, that's true. I was just slightly incorrect there. I mean, the Splinter Cell thing was massively incorrect.
But yes, we will see on that one. OK then, Matthew, let's get to the predictions then. So do you mind if I kick off?
I imagine we have some crossover here because there's not that much to talk about.
Yeah, let's put a bit of crossover. I will say these are based on Fuckall.
Yep, mine are based on Fuckall. There's a tiny bit of educated guessing based on some rumours that are doing the rounds for a couple of them, but that really is it. So we will see.
So let's do the big one. I imagine your first one is Switch 2 related, Matthew. I've got Nintendo Switch 2 launches in March 2025, cost £379.99 in the UK and launches with 3D Mario.
And as a bonus prediction, I've got that Mario Kart 9 launches at Christmas on the Switch successor. So a classic kind of like one, two punch of the biggest Nintendo things happening sort of like a few months apart. Just drive that real, real massive Christmas kind of interest in the console with Mario Kart 9.
That feels like a spot on to me. But launching with a classic 3D Mario feels like the way to go for a Nintendo console these days. And that price feels about right to me.
It won't cost the same as the PS5 or the Xbox Series X, but it will cost more than the previous Switch, I think. That's inevitable. What do you think of all that, MC?
I do like all that. I know I'll take the opportunity to slide in my first prediction because it's basically that, but slightly... The only difference is, and this is one I'm carrying forward, maybe for the second year now, because I'm really hooked on this, I think the 3D Mario team are making a 3D Donkey Kong game to launch alongside Switch 2.
I don't think it will be a 3D Mario game.
That is interesting.
I really want it to be a 3D Mario game, and really all this goes back to how heavy they are pushing Donkey Kong in the Mario movie, which was pretty mainstream, and the theme park. I just thought that was weird, that they've built a second Mario theme park and it's Donkey Kong themed. Maybe that's nothing, but Donkey Kong hasn't been the star of their own really good game for a long, long time.
I don't know, maybe the ideas will merge. Maybe the 3D Mario will have a Donkey Kong element to it. I just think it's weird that they've grown out the universe of Donkey Kong without having made a game based on it.
That might just be like a Miyamoto Vanity thing, because obviously he's synonymous with Donkey Kong too. But I would rather there be a 3D Mario game. My prediction is full of dread.
I dread that they're not making a 3D Mario, which is what I want.
Yeah, I suppose that the one thing that gave me a tiny bit of pause to 3D Mario was, worked quite a lot of the 3D Mario people involved with Mario Wonder, Matthew. So that made me wonder if maybe there's some other stuff going on and maybe they'd be further apart.
Yeah, sort of. It is the, I'm pretty sure it's the core of the new Super Mario Brothers team, but with Mr. 3D Mario from EAD Tokyo coming over to like head it up and give it a bit of a galaxy juice.
Right, right.
But whether that was just like a second one or whatever, I don't think it is the 3D Mario team that made it, based on what little interviews there are with the Nintendo team behind this, but that seemed to be the energy of it. Please make our 2D Mario team beloved as much as the 3D Mario team, Mr. Galaxy and Mr. Odyssey.
So I think that it has to be 3D Mario for a few reasons, because so the Switch 2 has the added, I mean, this could be a really interesting parallel to the DS 3DS, and Wii U launchers where those were all muted launchers in their own way. The Wii U launchers obviously a bit of a disaster, at least the lifespan of the console was. So I think they know very firmly they have to differentiate the consoles, because the form factor will be similar.
So to a lot of consumers, they'll see it and they'll be like, I don't really get how that's different from the one I've already got, but they want to create a high amount of demand. I think Nintendo just know from having the dual weaponry I guess, of Zelda and Mario at the last Switch launch, that is absolutely you've got to go best foot forward with your big guns. That will especially be true when there's a generation leap like this.
It's a very different handheld market that was reshaped by the Switch that are stepping into. So the Donkey Kong thing does make sense, but I think that Mario 3D still feels to me like the thing they'll do to just capture that massive mainstream attention. But I guess we'll see.
I guess we'll see, Matthew. All right. Anything else to say on the Switch?
What do you think about Mario Kart? Do you think that will happen this year?
So my second prediction after Donkey Kong was that Switch 2 will release with Mario Kart 9.
Interesting.
But that was based on the idea that I thought that if there's a Donkey Kong game, there's got to be a bit of straight up Mario in the mix too. I do think it's kind of crazy that we went the whole Switch generation without a new Mario Kart. But I completely get it.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the best-selling racing game of all time. Why not ride that success and stretch that success out with the DLC annual pass thing that they did? I think there will be a new Mario Kart in the mix.
Based entirely on that, Mario Kart was quite early in the Switch lifespan. So I definitely agree with you. If not launch, then Christmas or something.
I think it's just a game which is synonymous with Switch and, like you said, would help people make that leap. If I was to take a swing at what it was going to be, which is always kind of pointless with these things because no one would have guessed the last one was going to be like anti-Grav themed if that's even how people remember that game really. I think they might build on the couple of tracks that they did in DLC, both for Wii U and Switch, which kind of rift on wider Nintendo series like when they did the Zelda track and the Animal Crossing DLC.
Maybe a bit more of a Smash Brothers approach to pick a mix from other Nintendo franchises. I could see that going down quite well. Also in the absence of a Smash Brothers something that's a bit more sort of celebratory.
Feels like Mario Kart used to be very fixed on the Mario universe, I guess. Now it feels a little bit more porous.
Yeah, okay, interesting. That's kind of expert in-depth analysis.
That's based on FUGLE.
Hey, you used to do this professionally, Matthew.
Yeah, but that's what you do. You go, well, they did this, so they might do this. But if anything, if Nintendo did this, it means they definitely won't do that again.
So, yeah, that's the thing. I was just like, what other vehicles are there? They've done driving on the ceiling, they've done bikes, planes.
What else is there? I didn't wonder about track-making in a track-designer element, but I wouldn't give a shit about that, to be honest.
I don't know if that's got big mainstream appeal either. That's like a secondary feature.
No, who cares, really?
Yeah, it's a tricky one. I think that, I don't know, it's either just going to do something that shows off the visual splendor of what the hardware can do, right? Because they're always such amazing-looking games.
But this is exactly why I don't miss games journalism, because speculating about this stuff was absolutely like, I know fuck all, so let's just make some leaps based on this, this and this. That's why this podcast is entirely about things that actually exist, so we can talk about them in a meaningful way. Again, resenting the concept of the episode as I go.
Like, it's a fun thought exercise, and particularly with Nintendo, you know, like the idea that you can kind of read the two leaves of the last 20 years and extract something from it. And if I get it right, I'd feel like an absolute king. But I don't think I ever got one of these things right in all my time working on Nintendo Mags, so...
Fair enough, Matthew.
What a legacy.
They'll be talking about you. And yeah, I look forward to your obituary mentioning all of these things. OK, that implies I'm going to die after you, actually.
That's not the... that wasn't the intention.
Sounds good. That's a prediction for 2025.
OK, moving on then. Resident Evil 9 is revealed this year, but launches in early 2026. Thought I should chuck this in there.
I think you are right in that it was a quiet year for Resi, but I don't think it will be another quiet year for Resi, because there's just simply too much that's likely in the works between remakes and a new entry. A new entry makes sense before more remakes, I think, because obviously Resi 4 remake was up last, but also it's been four years this year since Resident Evil Village. So that's quite a long time.
That's exactly the length of time between Resi Village and Resi 7, even if that was even slightly less. So that's coming around. The rumour is that this is an open world game, and the reason I think that's got some legs is that Capcom's RE Engine, they've increasingly been using it for open world stuff.
It started, all the games they used it for originally were Your Devil May Crys and the likes, but yeah, Dragon's Dogma 2, Monster Hunter Wilds, they are big open world games that use this tech. And I feel like Resi Village gestures towards an open world something, and then ultimately becomes a slightly more scripted thing between this kind of hub setting of the village in between. How that would pan out exactly, I'm not totally sure, but of all the different big game series out there, I don't think there's any steadier hand on the wheel than Resi.
It feels very, very much in good hands. But I do think it's probably time for the new big Resi mainline entry. Matthew, what do you think?
I think so, and I definitely heard similar open world rumblings around this. There is this habit now of sort of in between game, which hasn't really got a neat label. Open world, but still very scripted, people often say like the wide linear thing.
I think of like the larger areas in like an Uncharted game, say, like in Uncharted 4 where it had the planes or that bit of downtown where you're riding the horse in The Last of Us Part 2, where you let people explore things in an order of their choice, but maintain control of how tightly orchestrated those individual points are when you're in them. And I could see Rezzy doing that, like I don't think it's just going to be like a free roaming, go anywhere, do anything kind of thing. I would see it as a, yeah, another step forward from the kind of the hub and level combination of Village, but maybe with a slightly more freeform hub.
But I'd be up for it. I like that kind of game. I mean, that's kind of what Star Wars Outlaws is, weirdly.
Like once you get to the missions, they become quite linear. Like uncharted missions, it's just like you're free to kind of poodle around, you know, in a big old desert in between them.
So that's why they're so good to those missions, because they are just tightly focused.
And yeah, but I kind of like that mode. You know, I feel like more people are realizing that you can do both. And, you know, it lets you kind of show off these very scripted sort of traditionally AAA cinematic beats, but also have that sense of discovery and freedom that comes with a bit of an open world.
Yeah, I agree. I think that that's like probably the future of open world games, really, is some kind of hybrid where there's a little bit of guide at hand. But it's also, I mean, I even thought with Spider-Man 2, all of the open world activities were, you know, there were some fetch quests in there, but they all had some kind of narrative element tying them together.
Yeah, there was some kind of, they weren't completely, there was no real superfluous content in there. It was all pretty well judged. And yeah, I think that's maybe indicative of where this stuff is, is going.
Okay.
I'm into it.
Yeah, absolutely. Capcom, always cooking. We're always excited about what they're up to on this podcast.
What's in Expedition, Matthew?
Square Enix to release a standalone version of Queen's Blood, or at least or add online battling to Rebirth.
Oh, that's tasty.
I know we didn't necessarily see it to begin with, but I think as a card game, it's proper enough and complete enough and padded out enough to maybe sustain this as an experiment. If anything, the limits of Queen's Blood is playing against slightly shitty AI characters. I'd be intrigued to see what happened if you did get to play another human.
The cards are good, the music's good. It's all there. Just do it.
Yeah, that would be really good. I can tell you what would happen if there was multiplayer Queen's Blood tantrums and me throwing things. I think that would definitely be on the cards.
This feels like a really good way they could expand FF7 Rebirth without having to do more story stuff. It could be within the game. Like you say, I guess stand-alone is your prediction, but it does feel like there is more to be done there.
I did ultimately feel like I was one around to it, but the game really tapped into the very basic potential of what you could do with it. So like you say, the AI opponents left you a bit wanting as well.
I was going to ask, have they ever done anything like this with any of their mini games before?
I believe there was a Chocobo dungeon or a Chocobo GP game that came out, right?
Right.
You could say that's a little bit in that vein. I believe for Triple Triad, they did some kind of app-based experience, but I don't think it was a huge deal. It was within a larger game, but they did bring back Triple Triad for that.
But it does feel like there's potential for this. Maybe there's some, what about eight different standalone versions of Gwent in the end? I feel like there were many different attempts to do Gwent by CD Projekt.
Well, there was Gwent, and then they kept reinventing the rules of it. What Gwent was as a standalone was very different to the core rules of Gwent, as they are in The Witcher 3. And then they also did Thronebreaker, which was the narrative RPG played with Gwent.
That was great. I absolutely loved Thronebreaker. I didn't actually play much of the standalone Gwent game, because it was just an online, collectible card game with online battling, and that's not really my scene.
Thronebreaker really feels like it was a bit ignored, despite being maybe the version of standalone Gwent people were actually after. It feels like it was unfairly ignored, which sucks for something with The Witcher attached to it. But alas, Matthew, that's a good prediction, though.
I like that. My next one. This is a rollover from last year.
Nintendo Switch finally gets those Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remasters in the waning days of the Switch. It does feel like it's now kind of go time on all of these. Why haven't you ever done X remasters?
Thousand Year Door and Xenoblade Chronicles X feel like two, or even like another code, feel like they were so unlikely even three years ago. But now we're in the position where Nintendo will want to keep selling software on previous Switch platforms while pushing people towards the new ones too. And I don't think anything else Zelda related is going to happen this year.
So I think that makes sense for these two. That said, I think this has probably been in about three of these different prediction episodes now. And I do I do very much entertained by the theory that every time someone drops a rumor saying these are coming out, Nintendo delays it by another year.
That's very funny to me. So I hope that's true. But at the same time, even though the Switch's kind of standards of software have maybe dropped in the last year, this would be an amazing last hurrah to get these last two on the system.
What do you think, Matthew?
It makes perfect sense that they weren't last year or the year before that, because we had Tears of the Kingdom and then we had the Zelda, you know, the Zelda Echoes of Wisdom game. So that makes sense to me. You don't need to double dip Zelda when you've got new Zelda.
But this year, they can't have another new Zelda, surely. Unless their Zelda pitch this year is we don't know how Switch 2 is going to handle backwards compatibility or if there's going to be a run of upgrades, paid upgrades, free upgrades, who knows what's going to happen. So there could be a Tears of the Kingdom Game of the Year edition or something this year which they make us buy, which would suck.
Like, if there's a bet, I want to be playing those games for free. But yes, a world where there's another code out on Switch, but not these games, I don't get that at all. That's crazy to me.
Yeah.
And the reason these have so much potential is because they are so underplayed relative to the rest of the series. These re-dos specifically have reached the tiniest possible audience of all major Nintendo games from the last 15 years, really. So it will happen eventually, I'm sure.
What's the next prediction, Matthew?
I actually wrote this one, and then I read something just before we recorded, which made me think, oh, this is totally wrong. I don't understand. It's the old boring Blue Point, Bloodborne thing again, but Blue Point will reveal an expanded remake of Bloodborne based on the continued teasing of Bloodborne fans from PlayStation itself in the 30th anniversary video.
It ended with Bloodborne and the message that it's all about persistence, which people take as a nod to the fact that there is still something to come. Blue Point have talked about working on something which is original, which some people wonder is that that would mean not a remake, but could it actually mean like original content for a pre-existing game? I'd be amazed if anyone other than Miyazaki himself made Bloodborne 2.
So I thought I'd stick with remake. Not that I'm bothered either way.
Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, I sort of feel the same way. I think that it is time that Blue Point's next thing was revealed.
That is definitely true. It's been four years since that remake of Demon's Souls. So, you know, it has to be something.
Yeah, I did think it was just a bit of a pandering to the Bloodborne psychos going on in that video, to be honest. I was just a bit like, oh, I saw that. I was like, those sickos are going to love this, aren't they?
That was kind of that was my one takeaway from that, as opposed to, oh, yeah, maybe they're teasing something. But there's something in that. Certainly, the realms of making predictions about the next year of games.
I think that's a reasonable one, Matthew.
I don't really know where everything stands in terms of who is allowed to make Bloodborne or remake Bloodborne or make a sequel, you know, because it's one of the ones PlayStation published, they own it. But obviously, Miyazaki-Sof is doing his own thing. Then again, you hear PlayStation are, if not trying to buy, but shoring up control of the people who own from software themselves.
Maybe there's something in it, who knows.
That would be wild if that happens. I'm slightly more open to the idea of new developers making original content for remakes after playing Sun Hill 2 remake, which is very faithful, but also as a few of its own touches, I thought worked quite tastefully. I mean, that's the thing is whatever they do with Bloodborne, you still have the original right there on PS4, and no one will ever stop talking about it.
So what harm is there really? I'm sure lots of harm to the Bloodborne psychos, but oh well. Okay, Matthew, next prediction.
GTA 6 doesn't come out this year, I'm sure you have a similar prediction, but it's not because a single player isn't ready, it's because GTA Online needs a longer runway. Red Dead Redemption 2's online multiplayer did not take off in the way that GTA Online did, despite it being people liking it and it offering a lot of the same kind of like, sort of joys of exploring an open world with other people that the, that GTA Online does. But I don't think that Rockstar can afford to get GTA Online wrong because they have to mass migrate that player base from five to six.
And you basically have, I'm not sure you can even do the same wait for stuff. Maybe you can do one month until that stuff starts dropping. But with GTA 5, I believe there was a slightly longer gap between the heist dropping in the game, which were the first kind of like full featured, exciting content they really added to GTA Online and the original game release.
And here, I think they just instantly need people to stay in GTA 6 once they start playing GTA 6. They can't really afford to split that player base. So I think the recent GTA, I think GTA 6 is probably ready, but the online stuff just needs a bit more time because they'll have a years long timeline of all this stuff coming out.
Maybe they won't say that's the reason. But the other thing that I think adds to this is that every GTA and Red Dead Redemption 2 has delayed at some point. So GTA 4 was meant to come out in 07, moved to 08.
Red Dead Redemption 2, I believe, was meant to come out in early 2018, moved to late 2018. And I think GTA 5 was originally 2012, then moved to 2013. So, editors note, it was actually delayed from spring 2013 to September 2013.
This always happens. These are monstrously huge games. You know, I think we will see a lot more of it this year, though.
And it will probably end up being early 2026. So those are my thoughts on GTA 6, Matthew, the elephant in the room.
That's all, you know, smartly observed and sounds... I could see that playing out that way. My GTA 6 prediction was incredibly specific and stupid about something that would happen in the game, as opposed to it coming out.
So it's going to feel woefully undercooked compared to that.
No, I can't wait to hear it.
But my GTA 6 prediction is that it will contain a side quest where you work with a true crime podcaster to explore the events of the original Vice City, letting them dunk on some of the worst missions from that game.
Oh, that's a nice idea. I like that.
They can have it all for free.
Yeah, this is a rock star if you're listening. Matthew is available for narrative design and level design work, so just drop him a line.
Or be in the podcaster.
That's a good show. I like that. I was thinking yesterday, do you think it tackles Trump, the game?
Because do you think this will be the first apolitical GTA because it's simply not worth it? Because obviously people, right-wing people, will play victim if they're dunked on in the game, but they're always dunked on, so I don't know.
I feel like they tend to riff more on cultrons and broader societal stuff rather than the specifics of the politics at the top.
Gig economy, they'll do that.
I can see it really gunning for the Manosphere and things like that that have really emerged over the last 10 years. You just know that there's going to be some fucking Joe Rogan or like. Will it even have radio stations or will it have podcasts to listen to?
Oh, well, that's an interesting... Maybe they'll do both, yeah. That's an interesting thought though.
I don't feel like they've ever explicitly talked about holding the game back so it's as relevant to the current moment as possible. You know, it's always quite a broad look at here's sort of what's been going on for five years and maybe what we think is going to happen next.
Did GTA V have a vague whiff of the sort of financial crash and the wealth gap? A tiny bit of that.
It had that and there was a lot of Tech Bro stuff in it. Lots of like...
Yeah, Facebook and stuff.
Making fun of YouTube and you know, that was there. But it was social media as it was ten years ago and it's like a very different place now. You could see them doing a bit of a Natural Born Killers with it or something.
A story about a crime spree that becomes a social phenomenon. I'm sure they won't do that and that's probably too obvious a route but the trailers seem to have a lot of phones and videos and updates and the way that people celebrate these things. They're making this game when the healthcare CEO guy was assassinated.
That feels more up their street than maybe like Trump.
Well obviously anything they do would have to have been thought of.
But that's it. They're probably like, that's the kind of thing you could imagine them coming up with. I mean, yeah.
I guess the danger with Trump is that even in 2017-18, liberal people were sick of hearing about Trump and obviously he has persisted in the culture. But I think that maybe they think it's too depressing to draw excessive attention to something that reminds you of that.
Yeah.
So yeah, I think that's well observed that the broader cultural trends is what they'll tap into. Will there be some kind of in-game version of TikTok, something like that? That seems more likely to me because that's something that's really exploded, the way media is consumed, Instagram, things like that in the last few years.
Will you be filming your own in-game TikToks of like crazy stunts and then sharing them in-game and shit?
I'm curious because also this is the first GTA without Dan Houser, right? All the Benz. Yeah, the Benz is gone.
Yeah, and so Dan Houser was always a credited writer on those games.
Yeah.
He seemed that he was quite a strong creative force behind the tone of the content. How they navigate that without him will be interesting as well. Will that change the tone?
We will soon see, I'm sure. I imagine that probably in the first half of the year, we'll hear something else about GTA 6. But again, that is a fucking lousy prediction, isn't it?
They might happen. That's what the entire podcast is. So let's move on, Matthew.
Is it my next prediction? So it was your GTA 6?
That was a later one from me I brought forward because I had to get it off my chest.
Let's do your next one then.
My next one. Oh.
I'm excited.
Mark Strong will be announced as playing Ganondorf in The Legend of Zelda movie.
All right.
He looks a bit like him.
Yeah. I can sort of see that. Is this the one that Wes Ball is doing?
Yeah. Which I think is so far off. We probably won't hear about it for another three years, but I often think, I think it's interesting that they're doing it live action.
Yeah.
You know, because you're like, well, whenever I see anyone who's like faintly elfin on TV, I kind of lodge them as, oh, that could be a link, or that could be like a child of the forest.
Yeah. I've still got it wedged in my head. Ever since someone said that Hunter Schafer could play both Link and Zelda.
That's just wedged in my head now.
The only other one I did wonder about, just because the guy directing it is the guy directed the This Summer's Apes film, is that the guy who was the villain in that, that Kevin Durant. He's got Ganondorf energy as well.
Yeah. I like that. It's an assembly of rather famous, but not excessively famous men who could play Ganondorf.
They're in the map, but they're in the map. What a rubbish prediction. This is a little low for me.
The Mario cast was just like a load of famous people with no relation to those characters. So they probably will cast big and famous rather than this person is a good character actor. I don't think that's their top priority.
I'm calling it now. This film is getting three stars from Empire. However it turns out, that's my...
Jack Black will be a Goron in it. A CG Goron.
I like that. That's good. Or one of the Koroks that you find.
He just pops out and starts doing a dance number.
Oh yeah, that big one with the maracas. Yeah.
Perfect. All right, good. Well, we're coming up with new and wacky predictions all the time in this episode.
Okay, this is a very general one, but why not? Marvel 1943 Rise of Hydra is a game of the year contender. So this is our first Amy Hennig game in a very long time.
It's since Uncharted 3, I think, so 12, 13 years ago this year. That is crazy. This is the game that has both Captain America and Black Panther in it, set in World War II.
I think it's one of those games that people are low-key excited about, but I think once we get a proper sense of the flavor of it this year and the different gameplay styles and just more of how it looks because it looks properly next-gen, it's a real cutting-edge Unreal Engine 5 game. I think it's going to be a huge, huge deal. I think people are up for this, the idea of a period setting Marvel thing as opposed to the present day as well.
Also, quite a long time has now passed between this and the Avengers games. I think it gives them a little bit of a fresh start in the midst of that, which is good. But I'm just excited to see an Amy Hennig game break cover, Matthew.
For sure.
She's an amazing writer and game designer. What do you think of this one?
Yeah, I like it. I mean, given what they've shown of it so far, my only worry is that it doesn't hit 2025, but I hope it does and I hope this one comes true, because this is exactly the kind of game I'm up for. I feel like Indiana Jones by itself has made people realise, oh yeah, licensed stuff can be really, really good again and people are more up for it.
So yes, please.
The hope is that Amy Hennig's team is going to make a Star Wars game after this as well, so we'll see. Yes, fingers crossed on that one, Matthew. What's the next prediction?
Team Ninja will mark 30 years of their studio with a reboot of Ninja Gaiden, which will take their various learnings from Neo and Rise of the Ronin, but bring that character back. I feel like they've kept that world going with nods to the fans. You can get Ryu's fighting style in Rise of the Ronin, for example.
I think they've actually set up another AAA gaming studio and yeah, I just wonder if they'd return to it. Maybe seeing the success Capcom have had kind of revitalizing some of their games from like 20 years ago. Like nothing's dead in the world of IP anymore it seems.
So why not?
Yeah, that makes sense to me. They seem to be able to make one Souls-like open world game every single year, this studio. So yeah, it doesn't seem implausible to me that they'd have time for this, Matthew.
Okay, good stuff. All right then, firing through them now, as we realize there isn't much meat on the bones with most of these, so there's not much more to say. I definitely include my own in that one.
How do other podcasts do it? I don't get it.
I think you just go, I can't wait to play this game based on this trailer. I think that's literally it. You just do that every week and then you put it out and you go, that's a podcast that is, and that's how you do it.
I just couldn't do it. I just don't find the news that interesting enough. You know what I mean?
I like talking about the actual nuts and bolts of games too much. Okay. I did an all-rounder Sony prediction last year, Matthew.
So I thought I'd do the same this year.
Oh, okay. I like this. It's like a, what do they call it?
A spread bet?
Yeah, a cowards bet, really. Yeah, so we see nothing of Wolverine on PS5 at all this year, but Sony has a good year with Ghost of Yate and Death Stranding 2 and the sequel to Returnal. I think that will happen this year as well.
I think Marathon will come out as well from Bungie, but I don't know where that's going to land. But I think overall, much like this year, really, there's a lot of good stuff on PS5 this year and then obviously, Concord was the thing that also happened this year that was, I think people drew an intense amount of scrutiny. But I think overall, you can't really complain about having FF7 Rebirth and Stellar Blade and what was the other big Sony thing last year?
Astrobot, of course. Yeah, that's a pretty strong year, even if you do take out the live service stuff. There's games there that people enjoy playing.
I think this will be strong again. So you've got a few different single-player things there, but the Returnal prediction and the Wolverine prediction are the two main ones, Matthew. What do you think?
Sounds good.
People love it.
Other podcasts do exist. After all that Wolverine leaky stuff, it just felt like, from the little bits that I read, that it was quite far off. And I can understand them wanting to lick their wings a bit after that and like knuckle down and just get on with it.
Yeah, I'll be up for... Well, I say I'll be up for more Returnal. Everyone knows that I didn't finish Returnal.
But I'll be up for more of a reason to force myself to finish and play the first Returnal.
Yeah, that makes sense. The first Returnal is what they should have called it. Really, Matthew.
Okay, what's your next prediction?
The new game from the Yakuza team, Project Century. I'm not going to say it's out in 2025, because it sounds like it's quite far off. But I think it will be revealed that its big hook or gimmick is that it's not confined to 1915 and will jump through several time periods to show the evolution of one area over the last 100 years.
Interesting. A bit of wishful thinking in this one.
Oh, absolutely. I mean, and that is based purely, I mean, it could be called Project Century, because it's set a century ago. But I just thought there was something about the modern music in that trailer that made me think, are they going to do something?
My original thing was, is it going to be about time travel? Is it going to be about a modern guy in that society? That's where it's going to get its swagger from.
Keir, you're about to die, but it's on a VR headset to live out all these adventures. Then at the very end of the game, he dies kind of thing.
Lots of people have theorized about this game, and the head of the studio has come out and said, oh, there is something about this game, but no one's worked out what it is. That's why I'm going big with my time travel theory.
I like that bold interpretation of what Project Century actually refers to. Matthew, that's decent. I do look forward to seeing more of that anyway.
It was a very cool reveal at the Game Awards. It looks like a real game, so that's exciting. More on the Sega lines here.
Persona 6 is announced this year, then released in early 2026. So, one can't help but notice that Atlus has been incredibly productive the last few years. They just had a very, very busy 2024.
I think they are nearing this kind of like... I think that maybe the model that Sega has now is the Yakuza like a dragon model of you're working on remakes, you're working on new games, and there's always something that's coming up. And it feels like the runway for Atlus is now pretty clear around Persona 6.
There's been quite a few rumblings about this in the background. But yeah, I think this will be the year this breaks cover, and then you'll have to wait until next year to actually see what it is, to actually play it. What do you think, Matthew?
Do you think Persona is in our future?
Yeah, I mean, it will definitely happen at some point. I just associate these games with them being announced and taking fucking ages to ever come out. But like you say, they are much faster at this stuff now.
Yeah, I hope so. I did wonder if we might see more of a Persona 3 reload version of Persona 4 before we saw Persona 6, but I don't know if it's Persona 4 Golden still just good enough that it doesn't need a newer version. I don't know.
No, I think we'll see both those things, but I think they'll have a bit more space between the 3 and 4 reloads is probably my guess, but I guess you could say the same about Metaphor and Persona 6. You'd want to have them a bit further apart.
I would say just on Persona 6, I would be interested to see them do Persona 6 maybe about slightly older characters like young adults, and about balancing working life, and that salaryman culture or whatever with the fantasy stuff. I don't necessarily think it has to be stuck in schools forever, and you can still have cool young adults who people aspire to be.
The advantage to doing that is you could actually see some slightly different sides of the city you set it in. So if you were set in Tokyo, you could go to Golden Guy and have a load of the little bars there and stuff like that, and you can exactly imagine in your head how those bars would look in Persona. You can really see it in your mind's eye.
So that would be cool.
Also, I just think the psychology of those characters, you know, the idea when you realise how stressful adult life is going to be or that it's not necessarily going to play out how you think it's going to play out. I think that's quite a fertile ground for the inner turmoil that you need to make Persona work.
I like that. So, good observations. It's always a question, though, of whether...
Because Japanese media just seems so locked into that shounen kind of...
Yeah, there is that, yeah...
.storytelling thing. And, like, it just... It's so rare to see things break out of that.
But, you know, there is a Western audience for whom I imagine people would go... You know, they would really be into the more adult-focused story in that series. So we will see, Matthew, but thank you for engaging me on that prediction.
I do appreciate it. What's your next one?
Well, this one's less of a prediction and more of a public service announcement in that I think 2025 is going to be an absolutely amazing year for visual novel likers.
Right, right.
Just, I was reading through for Gamer, the Japanese site, does this big article at the end of the year where they interview hundreds of Japanese developers and they ask them all the same four questions. What was your game of the year? What was your pop culture of the year?
Who's your person of the year? And what's your message for next year? And just in reading that, it just reminded me of like, oh, there's loads of games in development or coming out soon that I'd even not heard of or forgotten about.
Two of the earlier visual novels by Kotaro Ushikoshi, who did Zero Escape, Ever 17 and Never 7, are finally getting like localised and formally released in the West. That's going to be pretty big, because he kind of cut his teeth on those. We've also got Dark Auction, which is the Hitler antiques game from Rika Suzuki, the creator of Hotel Dusk.
And I also discovered that they're making a sequel to Raging Loop, which is a really good werewolf visual novel from about five years ago, called Depth Loop, which is written by one of the writers of 4-8 Shibuya Scramble. So I came out this article going, holy shit, I'm going to be playing loads of great visual novels this year. So it's not really a prediction, because those games are going to happen.
But I guess the prediction is that they're going to be good.
No, that's really good. I like that. That's much more useful than most of these predictions.
And it's certainly more useful than, I think, Mock Strong will be Ganondorf.
And if not him, that bloke, What Was In Lost, must have been.
Kevin Durant.
Oh, okay. That's really funny. Yeah, that sounds great, Matthew.
There's tons there. I'm relying on you to be our correspondent from the front lines of that genre. So I'm pleased that you're going to have a bit.
That's going to be your year, basically. It's just playing those, I think.
I still can't believe that Mrs. Singh is making a game about people who collect Hitler memorabilia.
I'm somehow not surprised. That's so singular and marching to the beat of their own drum, kind of like weirdness.
Yeah.
Well, let me know how that one pans out, Matthew.
I will.
Good stuff. Okay. Dynasty Warriors Origins takes over the January gaming discourse brackets until Monster Hunter comes out.
Can't help thinking that this new Dynasty Warriors game looks quite shiny and fun. And I think people are quite up for the idea of a Dynasty Warriors game that's got a bit of visual polish behind it. In general, I think critical reception towards the series has gently increased over time as they've made better and better entries.
I believe that the last Dynasty Warriors mainline entry was a bit of a stinker. So it's been a long time coming to have a new one come along, but it looks quite shiny. Out in mid-Jan, it's got perfect January game energy about it, Matthew.
Dump you, Eri, is the big picture, say. So I'm excited to see what the reception to this is, but I'm quite up for playing it. What do you think?
I'm definitely up for this. I think it's interesting. I think it's the first mainline one they've done since they did the Nintendo partnerships, so like the Zelda game and the Fire Emblem one.
So I do wonder if there's a broader audience who are more up for the idea of this. So if they can really land it, they could obviously tap into all those people who they got in the hook with Hyrule Warriors. So I really hope it's good.
I thought the crossover ones that the team made were really smart. So yeah, big shiny one. Next gen.
Yeah, could be good.
I've actually been a while now since they've made one. So it's a proper demand as I think actually built up for this. It doesn't feel like we've had too many of them in the last few years.
So good stuff, Matthew. I look forward to people banging on about that on Blue Sky.
I look forward to Sean picking it on the computer game show in their Game of the Year episode and it getting absolutely nowhere.
Yeah, and I feel the same way about James Farley and that pirate spinoff for Yakuza.
RIP that Game of the Year pick.
Good stuff. What's your next prediction, Matthew?
I think the Blueprints is going to be the indie game of the year that loads of people end up hating and being a bit cross about because they don't get it.
What game is that? I don't know anything about that.
I think it's been published by Royal Fury. I can't remember if it was at the Game Awards. There was something recently, the trailer had the developer in it explaining it.
It's the one which looks like it's going to be an escape room game, but it's a bit of a rogue-like about a house that you build by exploring it. It's got 45 rooms and you're trying to find the 46th room in it. It's been sort of bubbling away in the background, getting like good reactions to like the steam demos.
I think it's probably going to... It's one of those games that is going to win all the awards at the IGF and things like that. It feels to me like it has the profile and shape like an Outer Wilds, Obra Dinn style, like Critic Starling, but I think it's also going to be quite baffling and annoying to be outside of that, which is more what I'm trying to tap into with the prediction.
I think it's going to be this year's difficult but incredibly critically acclaimed indie game.
Or Laurel A and the Laser Eyes, Matthew, that kind of…
Yeah, maybe that's true. I mean, I didn't feel like it exploded in quite the same way.
No, that's true.
It's often like a game which goes big. At least it feels like it's going big in terms of the coverage it gets. But if you are outside of that bubble, it feels a little bit like, I don't get it.
Is it going to be this year's Animal Well? Is that maybe the best way of putting it?
Will there be a Discord for finding the 46th room? That's the question, Matthew.
I've already read slightly smug think pieces about I'm playing this. It's already my game of the year and I've only played the demo right up. So I'm like, this feels like it's going to be quite tiresome discourse around this one.
I love that prediction. I love that not just seeing up to the game's release, but seeing past the release and how people feel about it in the arts.
I see it all. I'm like dogs in Manhattan. I'm just everywhere all at once.
Yeah, it's November 2025. There's a backlash against the indie game. It's December 2024.
There's a backlash against Animal Well. Okay. Good stuff, Matthew.
I like the idea of that now. We're getting into more of the, we're all going to be sick of X predictions. I've got one of those too really.
It's a bit more of a wishlist one or something I hope happens. The consensus finally turns against Souls-Likes as we get nine more gray games with names like The Path of Death and Demon Sheath that no one remembers. That no one remembers one month after they release.
I just, I feel like there's an increasing number of these games that are bubbling away that no one knows the names of. And then like the really hardcore play them. But then I feel like the, I feel like we're probably past the mainstream peak of the, of interest in this specific formula, particularly games that have this like a period setting in an Asian country.
I think that those in particular are just a little bit like, you know, do we want more of these at this point? And some of them will do all right, but I think in general, maybe they just won't have the same cache they've had in years past. What do you think?
I mean, I hope so. It's just like a huge part of it, a huge conversation that we're never part of by our own choice. Yeah, I thought it was interesting that at the Game Awards, there didn't seem to be a new one of these, where usually there is.
I don't know if that's where at sort of peak saturation point. We shall see. I mean, the only thing is, because of Black Myth Rook on being a fucking ginormous hit, I wonder if there'll be a lot of people mimicking that three, four years down the line.
Yeah, I still only know two people have played that though. And it sort of feels like it was huge without being necessarily massive here.
I said this on Twitter, that for a game this big, it feels like no one's talking about it and got a bit shouted down about it.
Oh, the bubble conversation again. You're in a bubble. How dare you be in a bubble?
Well, it was more just like, oh, you don't acknowledge China? And it was like, well, no, I just don't follow anyone. You know, like what I'm saying is that in the cross-section of the people I do follow, I'm surprised like no one's talking about this.
When most games come out, they are talking about them.
Yeah, well, that's it. I mean, you're judging the cultural response, you know, in sort of like your way you live. And that is the criteria by which you just judge the cultural reception to any game.
Yeah, so.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, but I am shocked.
I wasn't saying, I don't believe it sold 15 million copies in China. I'm not saying that's all. I do believe it sold, but yeah.
No one was talking about it.
Yeah, exactly. Okay, moving on to your next prediction, Matthew.
Oh, this is another, this is just, you can tell where I like ran out of ideas. Well, you can tell where I ran out of ideas much earlier with the Mark Strong one. This is from the creator of that Mark Strong prediction comes this next one.
The next Shootakumi game will be a meta Ace Attorney game set across other Capcom franchises involving crime set in the universes of Monster Hunter, Resident Evil and Dead Rising.
You know, it's so funny, because I was, as I was having a bath this morning, I was there thinking, I bet he's going to have an Ace Attorney prediction that stretches the boundaries of like plausibility. I was like, that is nailed on. Every year, you have a new Ace Attorney prediction that's really weird and wacky.
I think I've even heard this one before, but I mean, please carry on Matthew.
Have I already done this one?
It rings a bell of some kind. I think maybe this idea has come up in a book.
It might have been something we talked about in a whimsical moment over the last year and it stuck with me. I just wonder if Capcom are in a place where everything they do is sort of gold, if they might have a little bit of a victory lap and this would be the best way of doing it. This would be the best franchise to bring them all together.
A bit like how they did the Leighton vs. Wright crossover side prediction, that will get an HD re-release at some point.
Yeah, that's probably more likely this year, especially because it's a big year for Leighton, isn't it? That's going to actually happen this year.
He's got to be doing something. Like, Shichikun is still there, still making games, and he can't just be producing that surely he's not just producing the HD remakes of these games.
Well, you know, in his cupboard, Matthew, that's what I always like, is he describes Shichikun in a cupboard. That always makes me laugh.
Well, now his old mate Kamiya is back doing Akami. Maybe he'll go over to Akami and write some funny dialogue for it.
Well, yeah, we will see. It'd be nice for there to be some movement on a new Ace Attorney something this year. I mean, we say that every year, I think.
I just want something. I do do an Ace Attorney prediction every year.
No, I enjoy it. I enjoy it. I was waiting for it, and there it was.
You delivered. It was good, Matthew. Okay, this is a really vanilla one.
The Star Wars XCOM-alike made by former Forraxas staff at BitReactor is unveiled this year. This has quietly been noodled away at in the background. BitReactor made up of, I think it was, I think it's Garth the Angelus.
I think that's his name, but certainly key Forraxas staff who I think it was even, this even happened before Midnight Suns released, broke away, formed this new studio. And then under Respawn, I think part of the wider sort of like Respawn project at EA, basically started noodling away at this. The first person game that Respawn were working on was sadly canceled, the Star Wars game.
I really wanted to play whatever that was. It was apparently inspired by Dark Forces and Jedi Knight, very much my sort of thing. That was scrapped, which is unfortunate, but this still exists.
I can't wait to see what a game in this form in that universe looks like, but I imagine it's gonna be quite close to X-Comm in style because I think they'll want people to go, oh, that's just Star Wars X-Comm and buy it. Any brief thoughts on this one, Matthew?
Yeah, like, sounds good again.
Yeah, that's absolutely fine. I don't need anything from you, any more from you.
I just want to shoot a Jawa with 95% hit probability.
It's apparently got 15 X-Comm veterans on its team, so it's got real potential to be something quite strong. There have been a few PC Gamer stories about this, because the devs have done general interviews, so they can't really talk about the game. But they talk about how it's a space.
It's like an area of games where there's a lot of room for innovation. They sort of allude to X-Comm just being the tip of the iceberg of what they could do. Yeah, I can't wait to see how that goes.
But I think that's been in the works now for like three years, something like that. So it feels like we're getting close to a reveal time. What's your next prediction, Matthew?
This is my final prediction.
We're almost there.
No more of this. Judas triggers a tsunami of boring Ken Levine think pieces, but we're all secretly thankful to have a traditional mainstream FPS that at least attempts something interesting narratively.
Yeah, I like this. I think that there's inevitably going to be people talking about Bioshock. There are going to be lowercase tweets about Bioshock Infinite this year.
That's definitely going to happen. Yeah, I'm intrigued by this without exactly getting the shape of it, Matthew.
He did all those interviews this year where people seemed to have seen a bit of it and he kind of explained a bit. You know, like, it sounds like more system shock even Bioshock in that you're on a spaceship. A very broad observation there, but...
And you're torn between the three kind of AI or robot masters of the ship and which ones you choose to help and work with affect how the ship behaves for you or something. I think it sounds cool. I like the Bioshock games.
You know, I will happily take someone, like I say, trying to do something over someone trying to do not a lot. Yeah.
Tell me that the video game landscape is not missing something from not having Bioshock now. I mean, those really added something. They were lightning rods to conversation.
They were great games. They were all great games. They were immersive sims that kind of like managed to cross over to the FPS space in a mainstream way, find that big audience and the production values were off the charts.
Like what's not to like about Bioshock, you know?
So yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Fingers crossed then Matthew that that all happens this year. A languid double bill of hotel dusk and last window drops on Nintendo Switch. We go out on a high Matthew.
Do you think this is plausible after another code?
I mean, it's certainly plausible. You know, I would have thought we would have got this before we got another code because this was better. But, you know, I don't know.
Maybe Nintendo want to distance themselves from the Hitler auction game.
That is wild. That's the thing that's happening. OK, well, with that in mind, Matthew, the predictions are over.
We have one more brief fantasy critic draft section to end with. So we'll take a quick break and come back with that. But thank God the predictions are over.
Jesus Christ. For another year, we are free.
Welcome back to the podcast. Got a brief little final section for you here as we kick off the year-end podcasting with 25 tired predictions from men who didn't really want to do them, but here we are, they are certainly done. Hope you got some meat on the bones there.
And I do always enjoy Matthew finding a way to get Ace Attorney into the episodes, that's good. So last year we did a fantasy critic draw, a very brief one where we just picked five games each. The idea being that the collective Metacritic score would determine the winner.
And I won by default because Matthew picked Hollow Knight Silksong, which didn't actually come out.
Fuck them, fuck them, lazy bastards not getting their game out.
So Matthew actually, if it had released and it had scored well, I think Matthew would have won. Matthew has 361 points out of 500. He picked Paper Mario, The Thousand Year Door, that got 88 on Metacritic, Shadow of the Earth Tree, 94, Persona 3 Reload, 87, FF7 Rebirth, 92.
And so Matthew did pretty well there. And then I had one extra game come out this year. All my games actually released to the calendar year, which was useful.
Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, 89. Dragon Stogma 2, 86. Metaphor, Re-Fantasio, Matthew's favorite game of all time, got 94.
Senua Saga, Hellblade 2, got 81. Unicorn Overlord, got 86. So I think Matthew would have won if he had like one more 87 getting there basically.
So, but we're gonna do the same this year, Matthew. So we'll take it in turns to pick five games and it'll be the same process. We'll come back in a year, see how we've done.
Should we do the coin flip to determine who goes first?
Yeah, one sec. Let me get the coin flip up. What do you want?
Heads.
Heads it is.
Okay. Well, obviously, they'll go first. It's not like the draft, is it?
Yeah.
All right then. So first pick, I'm going to take Monster Hunter Wilds. Feels like this is going to be the biggest moment yet for this series.
Absolutely off the charts hype for it. I've got the feeling it will hit above 90 on Metacritic. People just really love this, really go to bat for it.
The series is historically reviewed very well. Think this is the right pick, Matthew, to go first?
It's definitely coming out and it will definitely be good.
Yeah, okay.
There's some other things which are like riskier, but might score even higher. I think that's going to be a high one. Monster Hunter World was a 90, so.
Yeah, so it feels like it could go above that. So ask me first, Matthew, what's your first pick?
I'll go with Silksong again.
Okay, fair enough.
Glum for punishment.
I really hope it doesn't come out again.
I believe when that game comes out, it's going to be big. If it doesn't come out this year, I honestly think if it doesn't come out this year, maybe it's Moments Par. It's been too long.
Who cares, really?
That's so funny. I love the idea of you doing that.
I like people who make and release games.
You do. You value productivity famously.
I really value productivity.
Okay, here's a wild one for my second one, but I think this is spot on. Split Fiction is my number two.
Oh, shit, that was on my list.
Because the last one, It Takes Two got 88. There's something to be said for being the only game that scratches a particular itch of being like the co-op focused narrative sort of surprise game, and this I think will just be a better version of It Takes Two, just with a lot more going on in terms of set pieces and that kind of stuff. I thought trailer looked really strong.
I look forward to playing this with a friend at some point. I don't know who, but someone. So, yeah, I think this will do 90 plus, Matthew.
Thoughts?
I put it on my list for the same reason. People just like this formula, and it would have to have gone very wrong for it not to do the similar things It Takes Two, I don't think.
Okay, what's your second pick?
My second pick, I'll go with Ghost of Yote.
Oh, good choice.
As long as it comes out in 2025, I'm feeling good about that one. The original Ghost of Shima wasn't anywhere near a 90 for me, but I feel like that second run at it, a bit more power behind it, I like the look of it in the trailer. I think it's going to be a classic sequel that improves on the original.
Yeah, I look forward to seeing that a great deal. I think enough time has passed as well for there to be a real appetite to play more of this, even though the first game was arguably a bit overstuffed with things to do. I never played the expansion, actually.
Will I do that this year? Probably not, but I'll certainly play this sequel. My next pick, my third pick, is Sid Meier's Civilization VII.
Sid always reviews really well. I'm going very conservative here. I'm picking games that are actually coming out, but games where I feel pretty certain they're going to get a stellar critical response.
There's not been anything since Civ 6 came out that's really taken Sid's place. It's always the new game that's a successor. What does this one do differently?
I have no idea, but I'll find out in February when it unlocks on the Epic Games press account and I'll be able to play it, Matthew. So yes, I think Civ is an old dependable and feels right for a critic's draft like this, even though I'm sure listeners who play games on consoles are thinking, that's a boring pick. But hey, that's me.
What's the third pick, Matthew?
Not to put you in an awkward place, but I'm going to pick Doom the Dark Ages. Doom Eternal was one of my favourite games that year it came out. I just have complete faith in this team.
Trailers look rad, the concept's rad, really, really up for it. Come on, Doom the Dark Ages, drag me into the 90s. That's what I want.
It would have been so funny if you'd have picked Indiana Jones on PS5.
I don't think you can do that.
It feels a bit cheeky, doesn't it? OK, all right, then I will go slightly more adventurous for this next one. Actually, that's not true at all, but slightly more console focused.
I'm going to take Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater. So we know that MGS3 is widely regarded as one of the best, the best non-MGS5 entry in the series, but of the classic MGS narrative focus formula, the best one. I think there'll be a lot of goodwill for this because Metal Gear's been out of action for a very long time, Metal Gear survivor side.
So I think that people will be really up for this, looks super, super shiny as well. Something to really show off what your next gen gaming hardware can do more generally. So yeah, it feels like a safe bet.
I think this will get probably nines, Matthew, if it's good. Should land okay on Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater.
I'm really, really up for this. I think it looks brilliant. I think it's probably the fullest Metal Gear that you could remake.
So yeah, I'm really, really up for it.
What's your fourth pick?
Let's go for that Elden Ring expansion thing, Night Reign.
Oh God. Oh, I mean, fair enough.
It's not for me, but I'm pretty sure they'll give it to all the Elden Ring freaks to review and they'll give it eights and nines. So I feel like I'll be carried by an army of useful idiots to a high school here.
That's really funny. Yeah, fair enough.
Sorry, I mean all the peers that I respect.
There's been some strays caught on this episode, but all gaming podcasts, they caught some strays.
All podcasts.
Yeah, Shootakumi, It Is Cupboard, Makey Imaginary Games, I mean, yeah. And now everyone who likes Elden Ring in the media. Okay, good stuff Matthew.
My final pick then, I'm going to take a pun on Reanimal from Tarsier.
Oh, that was on my list.
Yeah, I thought this had a trailer that really captured people's imaginations. This is the studio that made Little Nightmares, very good 2D horror games, but they've moved on from that series, gone off to do something else. And this had a pretty nice edge cover recently.
I think this will come out this year, probably at the end of the year. I don't imagine they've announced it with more than a year for it to come out. Yes, Reanimal Matthew, that's my final pick here.
So what's your last pick?
I really want to take a swing on something which is like risky.
Well, you got Silksoul, that's the ultimate.
Yeah, but even riskier than that. So I'd say the two big risks are GTA 6, which I just don't see happening. The other one is Fable.
Oh, yeah, of course, Fable.
Because Fable is listed for 2025.
I thought about Fable as well.
Yeah, I think I've actually got a better chance over Fable if I guess that they were going to do Forza Horizon 6 this year, because those games tend to get announced and then happen quite quickly. I'm going to go with something that's at least announced. I am going to go with Fable.
I'm willing it to happen just because I want Fable in my life. Let's see. I'm sure when it comes out, it'll be good.
Does it come out 2025? God knows. Maybe it will slip in to that nice little spot vacated by GTA 6.
Yeah, I can't wait for this. It's going to be exciting to finally see more of it this year. So good stuff.
Those are our five picks apiece. We'll come back in a year and see how we did, Matthew. Anti-climactic podcasting.
I bet I lose again because Fable and Silksong don't come out.
Yeah, I think I've… there's a chance that Reanimal slips, but otherwise all of mine are coming out this year. Yeah, that happens.
Yeah, so that's the game.
There's a lot about our different personalities and how we perceive the world.
You want to believe in the magic of things that don't exist yet. That's okay. I simply believe in cold, practical things that are in front of me.
That's the difference between us, Matthew. Okay, that's this episode done. We have a Bonanza January planned.
We have a PS2 Redraft coming up. We have on the Excel tier on Patreon, two giant men play Bully Scholarship Edition, the Rockstar game. I'm already about halfway through that.
I cannot wait to talk about that with Matthew. I think that's going to be a really good episode. We have a guest episode with someone from an Xbox magazine background, not revealing their name in case the episode falls through.
Can happen with guest interviews, you never know. Probably some other stuff that I'm forgetting, Matthew. But in the meantime, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and MrBazzlePesto underscore on Twitter if you're still there.
Cool. And I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Blue Sky and Twitter.
The podcast is BackpagePod on both of those platforms as well. BackpageGames at gmail.com if you'd like to email us. A lot of the predictions for this episode, actually.
I feel like I should give a shout out to Graham's website, which has become a very useful kind of like recall tool for this podcast. backpagepod.co.uk if you'd like a comprehensive archive of all the games we've discussed in every episode. An unbelievably good archive of stuff.
If you want to go back and look at our top 10 lists of the best games of 2008 or whatever, that site is super useful. Been a very useful resource for making the podcast in the past year as me and Matthew reach our late 30s and we're very tired and we've said a lot of the same things over and over again, so useful to have. And that's us Matthew, let's get out of here.
Goodbye.
Bye bye.
