Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, we're joined by another special guest. So this week's guest is Simon Cardy from IGN, a UK podcasting favorite and friend of the show, Joe Scribbles. That was a mouthful.
I don't know why I tried to script that. And now I read it back, and I was like, that's basically, that's borderline incomprehensible, but Simon, it's good to have you.
It's good to be here. Yeah, I'm happy to be here. I kind of semi-arsed to be on this show.
So here I am, I'm here, looking to have a good time and talk about lots of weird stuff. I just want to make sure that Matthew has survived his Borgon trip without becoming embroiled in some sort of political incident.
I am now the States Minister of Denmark, so that happened. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, no, it was good.
I saw this parliament building from a distance and then went to sit in a board game cafe because the influencers I was out there with, none of them wanted to go and see the parliament building in the cold.
What a shock.
Yeah, life's hard sometimes, isn't it?
So I sat inside and ate some rather average chips. So that was Copenhagen.
Matthew, I had a question about the mashed potato photo of you doing the rounds on Blue Sky. So Matthew has now appeared on Blue Sky, Mr. Basil Pesto as expected. But Matthew, you sent me a message saying, I've eaten too much mashed potato.
And there was a photo of you eating mashed potato. Do you have any more context to add to that?
No, I know it wasn't, there isn't like a killer anecdote in this. I just ate a lot of mashed potato. We ordered a second bowl of mashed potato.
And then I felt like I should eat it. So not to be rude because it turned out, we sort of maxed out the rest of the table's mashed potato capacity. So yeah, I ate lots of mashed potato.
It's not one of my best.
But it was mashed potato this time.
That's important. It was incredible mashed potato. It was so creamy.
I had to ask. I thought they'd put cheese in it. It had such a sort of dairy vibe to it.
It was great mash.
This is why I'm here.
Yeah, absolutely. So reluctantly under duress from Simon, we're having him on the podcast. No, Simon, we're excited to have you here.
Talk about Remedy Entertainment, which I know is like something that you're interested in.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
Yeah, so excited to talk about that. But as ever, we want to dig into your personal history a little bit and talk about you as your first time guest on the show. You warned us you've made something like 4,000 words of notes about your life, so.
I mean, you said 4,000. I said I made some, but yeah. I had to kind of memorize, well, not memorize, but kind of remember what my childhood was like, because I don't think about, not that it's full of trauma, but I don't often actually think about how I started out with games or anything.
So it was good to kind of reminisce about all the terrible games I played as a kid.
That's good. I don't know why I'm busting your ball three. I don't know you.
So it's not like, it's already good for me today.
I mean, we've met once, but you know, you don't want to tell that story.
I just think there are, there are legal reasons that story shouldn't be told.
I mean, the nice version of it is we hung out in a cool cocktail bar in San Francisco with Josh Sawyer from Obsidian. That's the short story.
That's true. And then I left very suddenly and we won't discuss why, but yeah, but yes, that's a story for another day.
Not to keep talking about this story that we're not going to tell. I was quite shocked when I was told a version of the story. I was like, what?
I felt like there was a whole other side to Sam I'd never seen or heard about.
Yeah, like I have so many thoughts now about what this is.
Yeah, that's it. This is going to be one of the great untold stories of back page lore. There'll be like a Wiki stub for this on the fandom page for like, I don't know, two years until the truth finally comes out when I resigned from the podcast in disgrace, but yes.
Okay, so from there then, Simon, what's your personal history with games? What are the first games you love and what sort of like creates your passion for the medium?
When I was really young, like my dad had an NES or a NES. I've lost track of which way to say it now, but kind of my first games were like, you know, Mario, Mega Man. I was obsessed with Marble Madness as a kid, like played that so much at probably like age four or five.
It's probably because I could basically understand what was going on pretty simply.
You suffered from Marble Madness.
Exactly. I remember loving it, but it getting very hard, as with most games on that console did, I think. But I also remember being really obsessed and I never beat it with the Hook movie tie-in game.
I don't know if anyone ever played that, but it was kind of a bad action platformer where you played as Peter Pan and there was weird stuff going on. Again, very hard. I do remember playing that a lot.
And I never had a console again until the PS2. I was mainly PC for a good almost 10 years. And it started out with like begging basically to watch my dad play games on the computer because I was too young to play a lot of them myself.
So I just watch and help. I say help, I barely probably help like complete like Monkey Island and all the LucasArts games. Like my dad played like all the point and click games.
Did anyone here ever play Toonstruck? Yeah, I was obsessed with that as well as a kid.
That was a bit raunchy for kids, wasn't it?
It was kind of a little bit more like and slightly more adult Roger Rabbit.
Yeah, which was already like quite saucy.
Like the cover of it was quite terrifying. I remember it's almost like, I think it was like this like horrified looking like balloon animal thing.
Like a clown sticking a pin in something's eye.
Yeah, like a balloon. Yeah, like a balloon. Yeah, it was horrible.
But yeah, I wasn't too young. I mean, I was probably still too young to be engaging. And that was probably like nine, eight or nine and watching that.
But this explains a lot.
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I developed too young.
You've got big toon struck at eight energy.
I know, it's a miracle I'm not a toon by now, really.
You've gone full toon.
Exactly. But then, yeah, also like again, games are far too young for a member at the age of nine or 10 playing Myst, which is really like probably formed like my love for overly obnoxious puzzle games now. Like if it's a really like difficult puzzle game, like I'll force myself to play it and to an extent like it, even if I know it's not very good.
I'm still not sure if Myst is good. I think it is. I don't know if it's just really up its own ass.
I think Jury is still out on that one after all these years, but people cannot agree on Myst.
If it's something that's kind of borderline pretentious, I tend to like it. I'm like the same way with films. I'm like, I'm going to like this.
I'm still not sure. My dad played all the sequels. There's like six or seven Myst sequels.
There's so many.
You're our first guest whose parent was seriously into games. Like a lot of people we've had, I think that's right, Sam, right?
Yeah, I think that is right. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's kind of interesting. Do you know how your dad got into games?
I think he always liked computers and he always liked puzzles. So we were doing like jigsaws and puzzle books. It's more just like puzzle games.
He never like branched out from that. It was never like playing action games or like getting a pad out. Like he'll never use the PlayStation or anything like that.
Right, right. It's that level of games, but it will sound that, you know, definitely influenced me wanting to play more games. So like I'd watch him play those and then I'd play like Zumbinis, which is superb.
Making pizzas and working out. That's kind of like, I feel like my whole age, four to 11 was just, I don't know if it was my parents doing on me, just subconsciously training my brain for logic puzzles I'd encounter in life. I don't know if that's helped me, but I feel like it did.
But then, yeah, I kind of grew up a bit and would then have pocket money and go into game and game station and kind of buy anything I could. And do you remember that sold out software range? Yeah.
Of course.
Like anything, I think there was, were they all five pounds? Was that kind of the gist of it?
I think there were like two tiers. I think there's a five pound and a 10 pound tier for slightly sexier games.
I wasn't stretching to the 10 pound one. That wasn't happening. But yeah, I would just like literally probably every week buy a new one, no matter what it was, just look at it and be like, I haven't played this and try it.
Like some good games. And that's how I like played the first like couple of Broken Sword games and stuff like that. And they had older GTAs, but then like I play Sheep, that sort of Lemmings game.
They just had sheep in it. I play a lot of Brian Lara cricket. Jimmy White's Q-Ball World.
I lost a few hours to it. Played a lot of pool and sneaker in my bedroom at the age of like 11.
We had Whirlwinds snooker on the Amiga.
Oh, I had that as well. Yeah. I had the full Jimmy White collection.
That's the one that sometimes a face would appear on the ball, right? And it would like winky you salaciously.
I played a lot of salacious games as a child as well. That's what I'm finding out.
You had the video game taste of a 45 year old man at the age of 11, basically.
Yeah. Yeah. I've always been described as a bit of an old man and a young person, but I'm not that young anymore.
But you know, just kind of always had that sort of taste. I remember playing a game I used to love that no one talks about anymore. It's Freedom Force.
Oh yeah.
It's like a real time strategy superhero game. I had that Jack Kirby art style. Do you know there was a sequel to that game?
I didn't know that.
Freedom Force versus The Third Reich?
Yeah, until I started researching this, I only thought it was a one-off. I didn't realize they ever made a sequel and it was against the Nazis. I wish I'd played it because that really would have fitted my vibe as like an 11 year old.
You really hate Nazis.
I mean, that's the right side to be on. I didn't know that was a Kennedy. The things you learn.
The thing that helped me play those older games was there was an older teenager on the tills in Game Station who, he must have been like 18, 19, but a couple of years prior to him working at Game Station was the kid who used to be on the tills at my sweet shop at the top of the road. So I was kind of mates with him and he'd let me buy older games. The night was allowed really.
So I played, I didn't really take full advantage of it because the one I remember buying is Gangster's Organized Crime. An Eidos strategy, like Mafia game. But yeah, I didn't go, oh yeah, I should be buying GTA or something really good.
I was like, I'm going to buy the game that has like a mock up of Al Capone on the cover.
Yeah, incredibly dry management game.
Oh, it was probably so boring, but I have semi-form memories. It's one of those where I don't really have too many memories of playing it, but I do know I played it for at least 20 hours. And then like I said, yeah, I got kind of the PS2 and that's kind of where I really got into, that's kind of where Remedy come into it and we'll talk more about that later with Max Payne and GTA San Andreas were the ones for me that really kicked it in because I got a PS2 slightly late.
I was, so I was born in 92. So I got the PS2 probably when I was like 13. So not till like 2005, 2004 maybe.
So I'm still catching up on a few things I've missed on there. And that's where I kind of, at that age like 14, 15 was when I was really like into film. Like I think my first love will always be film.
And as much as I love games, film is kind of what influences a lot of my tastes. And GTA like Rockstar and Remedy, they were the studios I saw at that age of like really doing cinematic games for the first time and showing how cinematic games could be. And I kind of, since then I've always like, those are the games I've been drawn to.
I look for like tone and characters and story first. And I think Rockstar and Remedy kind of have that in abundance and those two studios are kind of intrinsically linked anyway in their history. And it's kind of, so yeah, that's where it kind of went from there on all the way to kind of these days where Red Dead 2 is my favorite game of all time, I think, just purely because of that tone and that sense of cinema.
And you know, I went to uni and played a load of games. Like I was quite sporty growing up. I played like football and cricket to an okay level, but then I got to uni and just my PS3.
I got a PS3 from my parents for getting the grades I needed at GCSEs to get into sixth form. And that was like the best day of my life. I was like, I can finally afford this very, very pricey machine, little did I know would not play the games, all the games the Xbox would play better.
But I got it and I had a good time of it. And it got me through uni. And like, I just think you remember like 2013 was a huge year for games.
I mean, it's still my favorite year for games. Like I only had like one lecture a week at uni for a long period of time. So I had a lot of free time.
And instead of doing something more productive, I like played like BioShock Infinite, Blackfag, Glastless, GTA V, like Nino Cooney, a lot of Peggle 2. It was such a good, Tomb Raider, Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons. It's just a redic, Papers, Please as well.
I think like it's a ridiculously good year. And yeah, that's where, and that's the year I graduated as well. And I kind of thought, oh, that's the first time I thought maybe one day I could work in games.
But yeah, that's kind of where that started. I never, until the age of really like 21, 22, did I ever think that working in games was a possibility. And it still took me a few years from there.
But yeah, that's kind of, that's where my love for games started.
It's interesting, because you flip from being a sort of someone who just gets into games through sort of more mechanic space games, I guess, and then becomes someone who's more interested in the narrative delivery, storytelling side of things. Do you observe that? I suppose you could argue Toonstruck is a narrative-driven game.
Yeah, I mean, like, I think that's what, especially when I was really young, it was like, that's what drove me to like Monkey Island and Grim Fandango was the story and the tone and the humor of those. But yeah, like the puzzles were what, yeah, as a kid, it was more mechanics-based. And then, yeah, as I, you know, you get, I think, I don't know, not every teenager, but me definitely gets really into films suddenly starts going, oh yeah, I love Martin Scorsese at the age of 12.
And then you start watching all the films, you're like, yeah, I need a higher brow of entertainment. And that's where I feel like games were starting to grow up and that's where that came from. So from that point onwards, like, I still value gameplay over a lot of things, but yeah, I feel like, yeah, when I review a game or look at a game, I'm like, oh, is that tone wanting to keep me in that world for hours?
And yeah, I think that's how that developed.
I feel like I've got quite a similar arc in terms of interests. Like I was also sort of started out with a lot of point and click games, got into films when I was like a teenager. I used to, I just had an incredibly embarrassing flashback to endlessly bothering friends with ideas that I, my ambition as like a 12, 13 year old was to grow up and make a film of Monkey Island.
I thought Monkey Island was like the greatest story ever and should absolutely be on the cinema screens and was always bothering people with how I would turn Monkey Island into a film, which must have been incredibly irritating to listen to.
Yeah, I think I did the same thing with Grim Fandango. I was like, this will be an amazing film. Yeah, I don't know if I could do it justice.
No, give it, just give me a chance. I'll do it.
I hope that the gauntlet has been thrown down. If you'd like to help Simon get it off the ground, please get in touch. I'm curious, you say you got sort of pretentious taste, Simon, this sounds, this is completely out of the blue.
You're big under the Silver Lake guy, I bet you are.
I haven't actually seen it.
Oh really, okay.
I probably should, shouldn't I? Just to take that one off the list.
It does feel like the sort of like poster child, modern sort of pretentious film in a lot of ways because commercially unsuccessful, A24, Andrew Garfield in a kind of weird spell. Like to me, it would seem like something that you'd be interested in, but anyway.
Sam's whole thing on this podcast is trying to get people to engage with him about under the Silver Lake and it not happening.
Joe, I will watch it at some point and then let you know if I think it's good, how about that?
I look forward to hearing from you in the next 10 years. That sounds good. It sounds like it's quite late then before you realize you could work in games in some capacity or at least you start thinking about that sort of thing.
So how do you end up on IGN? What's your journey to that job?
Oh, so like I said, it's not until my early 20s I thought, oh, maybe working in games would be something I could do. So I started editing video from 14, 15 at school. I was lucky enough my school had a big media background and I could do video editing from a really young age.
I've been using Premiere for probably like 17 years now. And like, I just, at that point I was definitely like, I could be a film director and I had a couple of ideas and then it turns out writing dialogue is near impossible. I just can't do it.
I don't know if you've ever tried writing dialogue for a script or anything. I barely speak like a human, so knowing how other humans speak is impossible to me. But still I carried on and I went to University of Leeds and studied television production and thought, oh, maybe I'll go into making music videos.
That was like the kind of like mini films. And I was looking at people like David Fincher and being like, he made music videos, then he made Fight Club, maybe I could do that. But then I kind of got big into the studio production side and directing and vision mixing, which if you don't want vision mixing, it's like that big kind of electronic keyboard that people have that cuts between all the cameras on a live feed.
And it's really intense, but I really enjoyed doing it. It was something like, I've always kind of enjoyed the pressure of things and I liked doing that. So I thought, oh, maybe I could do that in Spork.
So it's like Spork or like live concerts, like the people who do it are like, you know, like Glastonbury on the big screens, be the person who directs that, that would be a cool job. So I still wasn't really thinking about games. And then I left uni and I went like a year without a job, got depressed for a lot, but we'll skip that bit.
So that's not the fun part. Cause you know, when a lot of, I don't know if a lot of people, probably a lot of people these days, they do like leave uni and like, why won't anyone give me a job? I'm quite good, I think.
But that happened. I had one freelance gig during that whole time, which when I look back at it, is completely bizarre. Someone hired me to film the behind the scenes of one of the Pussycat Dolls music videos.
I was like, that was like two months after I left uni. And I was like, I don't know why, it was kind of like a friend or a friend put me in touch. And was like, do you want a few hundred pounds to film the behind the scenes of Ashley Roberts new music video?
And they actually used the footage. I don't think they liked me. I didn't like, I didn't like, and that was like what put me off the music industry.
I was like, everyone in that room was horrible. I did not like it. They didn't like you.
How did they make it known?
I don't know. They thought, oh, who's this like 21 year old who's turned up with his own camera who doesn't seem to know what he's doing. I don't know.
They're all like, they're all like, you know, music industry people. Like, I don't know, they're Pussycat Doll vibes. I don't know what that means.
Ashley Roberts just turned to you and went, I hate you. Do you know what that is? I hate that guy.
Yeah, get him out of there. But yeah, I didn't enjoy that. So the fact that you have to do that again, then kind of I still wasn't looking into games.
We'll get there eventually. Don't worry. And yeah, luckily got like the six week contract at a sports production company and ended up working there for three years in the end, covering like, I went to like Abu Dhabi to cover cricket and like I went to do like cover fencing grand prix's in Qatar and weird things.
So like, I kind of was lucky, like two dream jobs. Cause I love sport. Like I loved cricket growing up.
I still kind of like cricket and I even got to like work on some of the YouTube channel for Tottenham who are like, I have a season ticket for Spurs. So that was like a dream as well. And then, then we get onto IGN.
And I was like, I saw a job advert go out for a video producing. I was like, oh, chance my arm. I don't really think I'll get this.
And then a month later, a couple of, three rounds of interviews, was it two or three rounds of interviews? Can't remember now. And I somehow got it.
And I was like, oh, well, that's a dream job. Just out of nowhere. Kind of like lucky.
I feel like, you know, I know it's not all luck, but I do feel like I just kind of got straight to IGN. And everyone's like, how did you do that? I was like, well, I kind of started video editing and then applied for the job and did the.
Like people ask me like, well, what's the secret of getting a job in games or IGN? I was like, I applied, did the interview and got it. I don't know, like, I don't know.
There's no secret. I don't know.
I mean, that is one of the roots. There's the sort of slowly kind of ingratiate yourself over several years by getting to know people and work experience and hassling. And then you've got the, just apply for a job and be really fucking good like us.
And get it.
Yeah, the weird things, like I did listen to the IGN UK podcast for a bit before I joined and like, kind of, I didn't know any of the guys on it, but like I had actually met Joe about six months before.
Was he in the fencing competition?
He was, he was doing epic.
That fit was like a big scrubs move.
Yeah, but weirdly like, it was funny my first day at IGN cause I sat next to him and we reminisced about the story is that I was, I happened to be at Loading Bar at Dawson the same night as him and Gal I think. And I like, no, I never do this and like Joe never does this but at the end of the night, like we are both going in the same direction. So we shared a cab to Finsbury Park.
We didn't know each other. I was just like, oh, are you getting an Uber? It's like, oh yeah, let's split it.
And in the back of the Uber, I just like out of my pocket, just offered Joe a Werther's Original and he took it from a stranger. And like, we were both just like on my first day at IGN, I sat next to him and he was like, what is going on? It's like the guy who offered me a Werther's Original now I have to sit next to you for five years.
I mean, my favorite detail about that is that you're carrying them around. Like as a matter of course, like I've actually met anyone who's like, can I offer you a Werther's Original at this difficult time?
I was just big into them at the age of what, 25. I was like, I just love a Werther's Original.
It's the famous 20 something sweet, isn't it?
Like we've already established, I'm an old man. They are good though. We can all agree a Werther's Original is great, can't we?
Yeah, solid. That's a solid sweet.
I think my mouth is beyond Werther's Originals now because the temptation to chomp and that would like, that would just shatter my jaw. Like I know I've got at least three teeth that would explode on contact with a Werther's Original and I can't trust myself to suck them.
The secret is the soft centered ones you can get now that have almost like the soft caramel in the middle.
What?
So have you not seen these? They're like a Werther's Original but inside they have like soft caramel. So like, if you do get like a minute into it and you're bored, you can crunch it and not hurt yourself.
I would argue it has no right to call itself a Werther's Original.
I don't know what they call it. I'm going to have to, I'm not going to actually search.
Werther's Modified.
I can't remember what they call them, but they are good. And they're always like my go-to, cause I get really bad, like ear popping on planes. So I need something like a Werther's to suck on, on takeoff.
That's your story and you're sticking to it. It's all right. You just fucking love Werther's Originals.
You can't stop chomping on them.
I'm just flying every day and I need Werther's Originals.
It's like, oh, my ears popped when I walked down Bath High Street.
I just walked downstairs and the altitude does it.
It's like what he said to Joe in the cab.
We're going up a hill here.
High elevation in London.
But yeah, that's how I got to IGN. And then, yeah, I just kind of, I've been there for six years now. Started out as a video editor, just kind of cranking out videos that we'd make.
And then, yeah, eventually started spreading out and becoming a writer along the way.
How does that work? Because I've always wondered this kind of, there seems to be a lot of bleed between roles at IGN from an outside perspective.
That's the good thing. You're kind of given the opportunity, if you want to try something, give it a go. And it won't get published if it's terrible, but you can give it a go.
But of course, I'm British and they were like, oh, we haven't got anyone to review FIFA 19. So I was like, well, I feel like I can, I've been playing with FIFA since I was three foot high. I can do this.
So I gave FIFA 19 a go. The first review, it was okay. It wasn't the best piece of writing.
Definitely had a lot of notes and feedback on it, but I feel like it was okay in the end. And then I didn't really write for another year. I was like, I said I didn't write.
I did like little features, like I had to write scripts for videos and stuff like that, but no like big previews, reviews, anything like that. A year comes around and they're like, do you want to do FIFA 20? I was like, yeah, sure.
Yeah, I'll do that again. So I did FIFA 20. And then like after that kind of started really getting into reviewing, I just really enjoyed it.
And then little did I know the next couple I do would be very tough ones to tackle. After doing two years of FIFA, I then did Dreams and Disco Elysium.
Oh, fucking yikes.
Which are two quite complex beasts to tackle.
And then like, I felt like, you know, I got in at the deep end. I was like, once I'd done those two, I was like, I feel like I can tackle anything now really. So yeah, I kind of developed myself as an all-rounder.
I've like always kind of felt like I've had a critical eye. Like when I'd write about TV or TV or film at uni, but like never actually done like written an actual review before joining IGN. And then with, you know, the help of people like Joe and Matt Purzle IGN, who are both like great writers, you know, they helped me along.
Like kind of knew what I wanted to say. And I've always had weird turns of phrase I had to put into things, but you know, people like that have actually helped me structure my writing and not use 25 words when I can use six and stuff like that. So yeah, I felt like I'm kind of developing always as a writer, because I kind of like, so I've been editing for so long and I still enjoy video editing.
I always like talk about it being like a jigsaw puzzle where you can create kind of any picture you want from it, which is always fun, but like kind of, I've done that for a long time. So yeah, it's always like trying new things and that's what IGN gives you. And yeah, I kind of still get a bit of imposter syndrome.
I think everyone does, but like, you know, like reviewing the last of his TV show, like who am I to criticize Craig Mazin's direction or like to criticize- Yeah, I know, but like, you know. I thought he was great, but then I-
But yeah, I just, yeah, I've kind of developed myself and got to where I am now, I suppose.
This might be getting to the weeds a little bit. When you're on a big review at IGN, you're like writing it and your heads and all that, does your like video editing part of your role pause, or are you doing it in tandem? I've just always been curious.
I'm kind of doing, if it's a big review, so like last couple weeks I did Spider-Man 2, I just did that. And I would just be working on Spider-Man 2 review, basically, but I also edit my own video reviews. So I'm kind of edit, as I'm capturing, I'm kind of making notes and editing in my brain as I'm capturing.
So I am kind of video editing in a way, just in my head. But yeah, if you're on a big review like that, you're kind of on that. And you'll help out with other features like, and our guides team is like huge.
So like, you'll help out on like, here's some cool guides things you might want to look out for, or also like bear other features in mind as you're like making the review. So yeah, like you're kind of, yeah, if you're on, for example, on Spider-Man, I was on Spider-Man for the best part of two weeks, which, you know, lucky PlayStation give you that time. When other people don't, so yeah.
Yeah, okay, interesting. So what are your highlights of being on IGN to date? Do you have any wild trip or interview stories?
I think the first time I ever encountered you was, did you do something that went viral with Daniel Craig?
Is that right? Oh yeah, I've sold this story so many times, but I'll tell it one more time. It's, this is like, yeah, this is the big one.
I have lots of like little fun ones, but yeah, this is the one that people will bring up is. Yeah, so when they were revealing, you know how James Bond always make a massive deal of revealing the title of the new film and the cast. So for No Time to Die, I flew out to Jamaica for a day and a half, which was exhausting, but also one of the best things I've ever done.
So I get there and then they're like, oh, ferry you over to GoldenEye Lodge where Fleming wrote all of the stuff. It was incredible. I'm a big James Bond fan.
This was kind of like, I was kind of geeking out and all this, but also standing in this room with like all these like global news presenters being like, why am I here? A lot of these stories kind of revolve around me thinking, why am I here? But I was there and they were like, it was the whole cast of No Time to Die.
And I got there, had all my questions ready to ask about this film and where it was going. Then I get there and like, oh, by the way, you can't actually ask any questions about the film or the plot or the villain or anything. So I was like, oh, well, that's all my questions gone.
So instead I happened to have on my phone from a few months earlier, a video of me doing the James Bond gunshot through a toilet roll using a red piece of plastic as blood. You just happen to have these things on your phone. And I was just like, do you know what?
It was my backup plan. I was like, I'm just going to go for it. I can kind of do any interview I feel like now.
So I've gone through the gauntlet of showing Daniel Craig and Anna D'Armas and Lea Sidoux, a 10 second video of me shooting through a toilet roll and then going, oh, this is interesting. So yeah, I auditioned to be James Bond and I still haven't heard back Barbara Broccoli, the producer James Bond, I don't think she likes me at all. If you've watched that video, she doesn't have much time for me.
And I think that's only because it was like a couple of weeks after Roger Moore had died or quite soon after Roger Moore had died. And the person who exited the room just as I was going in to talk to her had just finished, I think a real like 10 minute, real like solemn talk about the legacy of Roger Moore. And then I come in and be like, hey, do you think I could be James Bond?
And she wasn't in the mood. But yeah, that's definitely, that's got to be the most memorable. But like I've done like, I do like film and game stuff, which is great.
That's the thing I love about IGN is like week to week it is different. So like I've been lucky enough to like meet some of my real like film heroes, like interview like Denny Villeneuve, Del Toro, Christopher Nolan, like Steven Spielberg, which I almost cried.
Fucking Spielberg, what's that like? What's it like chatting to Spielberg?
It was great. He was like the nicest, he really was like the nicest man. It was talking to like the nicest, like uncle or grandpa in the world.
He was just like, no question did I ask him. He was like, oh, why are you asking that? He was just like really, really lovely.
And like, I did a thing in the end. Like I don't, I do end it's like people I really, really love. I was like at the end, like did a heartfelt, like thank you for everything you've made.
They mean a lot to me. And I was like, you could tell like, you know, he, he appreciated that. I feel like maybe a lot of these people don't hear it as often as you think.
I don't know, like a genuine thank you. Like they kind of, you know, assume people like their films, but that was cool. Like, I don't know if you ever, maybe you ever done a film junket before?
Like, I want to be set up.
Yeah, I have. I did, I did Prometheus and I did Fast Bender and New Mirror Pass. And I think that, I think that might've been it for like the big ones, the rest were phoners, but yeah, that was, that was weird.
It was quite, quite furious.
They're like the most unnecessarily stressful experiences in the world, film junkets. Like you go to these big London hotels and they make you get there like two to three hours before you need to be there. Then you sit in an out, like an hour or two in a waiting room with like loads of other journalists, normally waiting for just like four minutes with someone.
And then you get like a maximum three questions and you have the pressure of trying to get a feature or a news headline out of that four minutes. And yeah, like it's, it's a stressful experience, but I do enjoy film junkets, but like game strips are definitely the more fun ones. And I do have a few of those as well, if you'd like to hear them.
Of course, yeah, go ahead.
A cool one was like getting, I'd never been to Japan before, so I got to go to Osaka for Kingdom Hearts 3 before that. And I got there like as a producer trying to film stuff and you get to the office, you get to square Osaka and you're just like, I can't wait to film all this stuff. And you get there and the PR is like, oh, they won't actually let you film anything of the office.
You can just film this cabinet full of toys. I was like, oh cool, traveled all this way to film that. And what, and like a couple of interviews to be fair, but like I do remember just listening to Nomura speak a lot of bollocks is what I remember.
Just like, well, trying to hear it through like the clanging of the amount of chains he was wearing on his trousers. I do remember that. Interesting man.
When your outfit begins to sort of impinge on the audio quality, you know you got a problem.
For Forza Horizon 4, we do a thing called IGN first, which is like, they're basically our cover features. We go to a studio for a pre-release game and like do loads of preview. Preview features for a game.
And we did that for Forza Horizon 4. So we got to go to Playground. That was the one that was set in Britain.
So we then like bizarrely just drove around the Cotswold for a few hours and a half, a million pound McLaren, driven by Ralph Fulton of Playground, just chatting to him. That was weird. Yeah, that didn't really...
We did kind of make a video out of that, but it was more just, do you want to go drive sports cars around the Cotswold for a few hours? Yeah, it's a nice day. Yeah, I don't drive, so I kind of missed out on most of the fun.
I sat in the passenger seat, like, trying to film while going too fast in a car, so that was fun. There was this massive... I went to this one with Joe, actually.
It's a Fallout 76 trip to...
This one's quite famous, isn't it?
Yeah, like, massive resort hotel in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Completely unnecessary, just completely unnecessary to go play Fallout 76 for, like, three hours. But, you know, I enjoyed the ax throwing and, like, doing a tour of, like, the president's nuclear bunker.
It's where he'd go if there was nuclear war. He'd go to this... It's one of his options, is go into this massive hotel.
It just had really did have quite cursed, like, 50s, 60s energy to a lot of the staff in that hotel. It kind of stuck in time a little bit. It was a fun trip and, again, completely unnecessary, but I wasn't complaining.
The last one I can think of is, and this is definitely one of those stories where I said, oh, I'm just, I'm not meant to be here. I'm out of places. Went to a launch party for one of the NBA 2K games in New York.
I was there for like 30 hours in New York and I kind of went there thinking I could go there and capture some gameplay for a video we were gonna make. We did these unofficial preview videos a few years ago that were kind of like meant to be like alternative, like funny takes on previews for games. I went there thinking, oh, I can go to this launch event and capture some of the game, get some footage and start writing a script for this.
And little did I know that demo was actually released while I was flying there, I think. So I didn't need to even go there to do it. I could have stayed at home and done it.
So I'm at this, which I thought was like a preview event. Turned out it was a full on launch party in like a small warehouse in Brooklyn with like full like NBA all-stars, like Kevin Garnett from Uncut Gems there. I'm just in this room like, and then Travis Scott, the rapper comes on and plays the show for 20 minutes.
I'm just like, what's going on here? All while I'm like really badgering the poor PR, like, do you know if any of these consoles have HDMI out? I've got my app ready to capture.
And they were like, oh no, sorry, this is just for people to plan. I'm like, oh, so I'm just kind of, I suppose I should just kind of stand here and enjoy the rap music.
Having to work at a thing, which is meant to be fun for everyone.
Oh no.
It's always tough. We did that, we had to film a thing on Xbox on with a, we'd been building up to this Xbox on versus this NFL player at Madden, but we had to do it at the Madden launch party. And like the NFL player was not there to like work.
You know, he just wanted to like go and hang out with all his mates and like, you could just tell his absolute contempt for us.
Yeah. I was just, yeah, kind of like, I gave up after a bit. I was like, okay, let me, I'll just, I'll just have a drink and trying to put my capture ticket somewhere safe and make sure no, make sure an NBA All-Star doesn't seal my solid straight drive.
Doesn't spill punch into your Atomos.
Yeah, exactly. You just don't want that happening. But yeah, that was, you know, it was a little awkward, but ultimately very fun to be in New York.
That's the only time I've ever been to New York. I didn't even see the Statue of Liberty. So yeah, I need to go back.
But yeah, those are, those are a few highlights.
You do get some amazing access on IGN. That's the thing, isn't it? It's just like, you know, of all the sites, you're gonna be the one who gets like the best, the best access.
I feel like I do take it for granted because it's kind of all I've ever known. Yeah, yeah.
You need to try working on the second bestselling unofficial PlayStation magazine. It completely resets your expectations, I'll be honest.
I'll travel back in time and do an exchange program.
To when that was possible. Yeah. Yeah, okay, good stuff.
Of all those, Simon, I'm afraid I'm gonna probe you more about Kingdom Hearts. Is that something you were interested in before going on that trip? Or did you just sort of go on it because it was a good opportunity?
I'm not like a massive Kingdom Hearts head. It's more like, Joe was there with me. He was writing about it.
I was more there as a producer. I had played Kingdom Hearts 2 and enjoyed it. I played like half of Kingdom Hearts 3, mainly because I just wanted to play the Toy Story stuff because I'm obsessed with Toy Story.
I was always more in Kingdom Hearts for the weird Disney stuff than any of the actual Sora nonsense. I shouldn't say nonsense. People really love Kingdom Hearts, don't they?
You don't have to respect those people.
But it was good to me. I've kind of enjoyed Kingdom Hearts enough over the years, but I would never say I'm a Kingdom Hearts fan, necessarily.
Very diplomatic.
How's hosting the IGN UK pod going these days? I listened to the sandwich special you did in 2020 on your recommendation. It delivered many delicious horrors and a combination of words I wish I could get out of my head forever, anal fistula, which I didn't know was a thing, but fortunately now I do and it lives with me forever.
Not every episode is like that, but that is a particular highlight. We just got everyone, spent a year trying to get everyone sending their sandwich stories because that year we decided to do sandwich stories. I think the year after we did Drowning Stories.
Not quite Drowning, funny near-drowning stories was the requisite word. There are some funny ones out there. The sandwich stories are definitely funnier, though.
The man, the unfortunate soul, who ate a beef sandwich so large that it ruptured his anus was one. My other favorite, a low-key one in that episode, is the man who ordered a salmon bagel and just got some salmon poked through the hole in the middle of the bagel and presented it to him.
Made our sandwich tale seem quite vanilla by comparison. I can't believe we've wasted everyone's time with what is clearly just regular sandwiches.
They're all valid. They're all good sandwiches. I mean, don't put yourself down.
It is weird how that current across section of seems to be UK's games media and sandwiches seems to be a very event diagram that crosses over quite a bit. But yeah, I enjoy hosting it. I'm kind of envious of you guys.
I love the draft format and we've kind of tried to do our own sort of version of that a couple of times, but it's not as clean as how you guys do it. I listen to the big picture as well and I get what you guys go for and you do it very well. So there you go, there's a compliment.
You don't just think we rip it off too much.
No, no, no, because it's not a rip off of it, because they're doing films, you're doing games. That's different.
Yeah, and totally different things.
Completely different, unique, special. We try and keep it fresh. We're lucky we can have six or seven people to rotate in and I just wish we had more time to plan them because they're kind of like sound we do for fun on a Thursday or a Friday and put it out.
But it often results into what we've been playing or what we've been watching this week and that's kind of the... The other thing is we can kind of cover anything. We're under the US radar.
Our US podcasts are more official, like Beyond PlayStation 1 and stuff like that. They're more scripted and a tight hour. Whereas ours, we can just be like, what the hell do we want to talk about?
We can literally talk about sandwiches for an hour if we want and put it out there. That's the fun thing about it.
I often find, definitely with this podcast, I imagine it's the same with yours though, that sometimes the more effort we put into something, the less it seems to land. People seem absolutely fine just listening to about some new games that came out this week and that's enough.
Exactly. You don't want it too scripted. You don't want to feel like you're listening to an article in a way, do you?
You want to listen to a chat.
Of course. That is definitely some of our episodes.
Matthew, what are you thinking of there? I'm curious. What do you think was a bust that took loads of effort?
When we do maybe a very big series deep dive or whatever, that requires a huge amount of prep or one where we've played loads of stuff and really gone in depth on research or kind of recapping or reminding ourselves of something when actually people will settle for just some bullshit mail back. Game score. Yeah, exactly.
Which is very low lift.
I think it works because it's research but you can also tell you guys care or enjoy the topics you speak about. You're not just talking about anything for the sake of it, if you know what I mean. It's not like you're researching something for the first time, you know, nothing about and regurgitating.
How do you find changing lineup and like stuff changes over the years? You know, you don't have scripts anymore, but you obviously had stretches where you had, you know, a kind of quite fixed team. Have you found that easy to navigate?
It does change the vibe because you'll... I feel like we were a few years ago as a very tight group, especially because we were in the office every day and we kind of were all best mates. And then like the last couple of years, you've had a pandemic, which I don't know if you guys knew that happened.
Yeah. But and then also like, yeah, that rotation of staff. So we've had like a few new people in, a few people out and like it is a different vibe.
It's still, I think it's still a good show, but it's not that same like camaraderie to an extent, just because you're not as good friends with the people because you don't spend all day sitting next to them. So like you'd have the same in jokes or like, it's much more, it's a different, I still think it's good, but yeah. I mean like when Joe left, obviously I was heartbroken because he brings a lot of A, knowledge and B, weirdness and humor to the tip of our gusts.
But like we still have that.
Joe leaving is never a good thing for any enterprise.
No, it does hurt. But yeah, I mean, we're still keeping going. I think we're here episode, not that I've been there from the start, like this week's episode, last week's even was 719.
So it's been going for years and years and years. Yeah, I think my first one was 399. So I've been there almost almost halfway now, actually.
Yeah, that's a lot of podding.
It is. I mean, it's just like we kind of really just treat it as a way of like having a nice fun chat for an hour every week, because especially now we all work from home. Like it's just I get to talk to like Matt and Dale and people about games for an hour when we don't really, you know, I don't just jump on a Google or a Discord call and be like, oh, should we talk about what we think about Spider-Man for an hour?
But it's good to do it on the podcast. A bit of fun.
Yeah, absolutely. So what have you been up to lately on IGN, Simon? Obviously Spider-Man is the big reason.
Yeah, I just reviewed Spider-Man 2 and gave the outrageous score of an 8 out of 10 to a great game. People aren't happy about that. I've got my reasons.
Read all the words if you want. I'm not going to talk about Spider-Man again. I enjoy reviewing the big games.
Like I said, I enjoyed the pressure of work and stuff like that. Recently as well, we went to another one of IGN first in September on Alan Wake 2. We did a lot of cool preview and behind the scenes stuff.
Me and Matt Perslow did that. Me and Matt also worked on what I think is a great video called How the PlayStation Changed Everything. If you haven't seen that, I think listeners of this podcast will enjoy that one a lot.
It's like a fun nostalgia piece where we interviewed Sean Layden and Andrew House about how the PlayStation, the launch of the original PlayStation in the 90s, and how it kind of shifted the games landscape and all the games of that. It's a really cool thing, I think. And then there's sort of like stuff I'm more behind the scenes proud of that I think people don't realize.
So my role, I'm technically still a producer. Like I'm not all like, you know, the highlights you see like my name on on site, I like articles and stuff like that. But there's a lot of behind the scenes stuff.
Like, for example, Gamescom, like it's a huge IGN operation. I think like people who join IGN don't realize how much work we put in until you're like behind the scenes on a big show like that or like something Games Fest or something like that. Like we send like 50 odd staff to Gamescom every year for production and like for the last couple of years, I've been content producing it.
So for like the six week, that's why like during summer, I don't really tend to write or make videos much because I'm spending six weeks prepping for Gamescom, which is basically me and like one or two others emailing and having meetings with almost like every European PR and booking in studio interviews because we have four hours of studio show for five days in a row. We have to fill in with studio interviews as well as I'm in charge of booking all our hands on appointments for everyone at Gamescom. So like there's just a lot of it's a month of two without much sleep as it bleeds into a lot of US hours.
But again, I kind of weirdly enjoy the organizing things and the pressure of that. But yeah, you also have to send all the apology emails of like, sorry, we don't have room. So I'm sorry, Sam, if we ever reject one of your games.
It's not only down to me, but it might come from you.
The truth will out.
Matt Purcell came to see our game. I did.
I put that in.
Yeah, I was happy to see him. It's all good. Well, Simon, that was a lot of great detail about your background there.
So that sounded like a back alley compliment, didn't it?
I mean, it was, but it's fine.
The story that really stays with me is you being driven around by Ralph Fulton, just picking you with a giant camera, just sort of like panicking, hoping the car doesn't careen when it goes out of corners or something.
Yeah, I was trying to film in slo-mo, which I realized, like, why am I in the point of this car is it goes really fast, and I'm filming in slo-mo. I was like, what am I doing?
I can't wait for when he does that for Fable and takes you around the Cotswolds on the back of a horse.
Just shrinks me into the size of a gnome or something.
Yeah, does lots of farts.
That's the perfect transition point for our break, so let's take a quick break and come back and talk about Remedy.
Welcome back to the podcast. So in this half of the podcast, we're gonna talk all about Remedy Entertainment's games, as advertised in the episode title. If you made it this far, well done.
You got through round one. No, not on top, Simon.
Oh, it was good. That was quite a lively part one.
Yeah, I think people who kind of know what the podcast is at this point expect a lengthy preamble, especially when you have a new guest you haven't spoken to before. So it's all good. So Simon, let's start with that remedy trip you mentioned for your IGN first.
What was that like? Tell us about that experience.
It's great. I'm lucky enough that's the second time I've been to Remedy. So I went there for control as well.
And it's just a really nice studio. Have either of you guys been to Remedy?
No.
So it's just outside of Helsinki in a place called Espoo. And it's maybe my favorite studio to visit. Like there may be my favorite video game developer full stop, I think.
So it's always a treat to go there, but it's always looks like a really nice place to work. Like has that sort of like Scandinavian like sort of relaxed atmosphere to it, I think. Everyone looks like they're kind of chilled out.
And so we like in true Finnish style, like we played quite a bit of Alan Wake 2 in their sauna lounge, which is as advertised, a big like really nice plush room with a massive TV, really nice sofas, like its own little kitchen with drinks in. Then next door is an actual sauna in case you need to sweat for a bit in between playing. Like I think it's mainly for employees.
If like, I know it's a really long day. It's like, oh, I need a sauna for a bit. But yeah, I've never worked anywhere that had a sauna, but there you go.
So you didn't have a Sam Lake bursting in and you were just in the sauna and that's how like, oh, sorry. Sorry, I thought anyone could use it kind of situation.
But it's funny you mentioned Sam Lake cause I kind of, the first time I went to Remedy, it was for Control and he was writing on Control, but he wasn't like leading the project. And like, I bumped him to him in the kitchen, making a coffee and like shook his hand and said, hi, but that was it. Like we weren't interviewing him, weren't talking to him for Control.
Alan Wake 2 is much more his baby. So yeah, we're just, me and Matt Perslow both in Remedy, next to a sauna playing the game. And then yeah, like Sam Lake just walks in.
Not from the sauna?
Not from the sauna, no, sorry. From the, yeah, just in a towel, no. He just walks in and no matter how you try and shake it from your head, it is just Max Payne's face being really nice to you.
I've met him like two or three times now. In your head, I'm like, that is Max Payne. Like that is him talking to me.
And even like when we did the, we did one and two of him and like we were talking about Max Payne and he did the face and I'm just sitting there like, he's done the face, he did the face. He moved his eyebrows. And like Sam Lake's a cool guy as well.
It's just like a really cool, relaxed place to work. And well, I don't work there. I'm saying that it looks like a cool, relaxed place to work.
I hope there's no horror stories, but yeah. I've seen what we're, this podcast is coming out on the day, Alan Wake 2 comes out, right? I haven't had a chance to actually properly play the game.
Like I played quite a bit of it when I was at the studio. So I've played like the first few hours, but like, yeah. I can't give a full opinion of that game yet, but it was at least at that point shaping up to be very good.
So yeah.
One of my favorite things about Remedy being are where they are is that there's an abnormal number of non-finnish people who know the existence of Espoo. Just cause we've been reading that word in features for so many years. I doubt there's many people outside games who could tell you of Espoo's existence.
Yeah. There's probably a lot of like preview articles that have like opened with in a, I don't know, in a window pane studio in the town of Espoo.
What's Espoo like? Is it like a city?
It seems like a little like suburban. No, is it suburban? It's more like a, I don't know.
It's like, it feels like a new town, like outside of London. Maybe it's like, I don't know. Is it Finland's, yeah.
Like is it Finland's welling garden city? I don't know. Maybe it's more like Guildford.
It's got games there. Maybe it's like Guildford to Helsinki's London. I don't know.
I'm not from Finland. I'm just guessing.
I hear it's very scenic around there though, like the journey to get to the studio. I remember Andy Kelly telling me about this when he went to see Control that you see some beauty. I think he mentioned a frozen lake he went past when he went there, for example.
I mean, I went there during summer, so I didn't see that necessarily. But there is, it is nicely on the coast. Helsinki is a beautiful place.
There's this weird mixture of Eastern European architecture, but then almost like brutalist Soviet stuff as well, because they're pretty much, I was wary of it when I was there. It's almost as close as you can get to Russia without being there at the moment. It's there and not that it felt all tense there, but it was like, yeah, you still had that Soviet vibe going on a little bit, but I'm into it.
Had some nice food.
Okay, excellent. I'm glad we cleared that up. Remedy Entertainment, the reason we want to dedicate an episode to them, like Simon says, Alan Wake 2 is out the day this podcast goes live.
I know that I've heard on The Gravevine that code for this has been very tight. I think they might even have said this publicly, but they've been working on it right up to the last minute. So that's the reason that Simon's played a bit of it, and we can talk about it for this episode, but otherwise it's not something that everyone has played yet, and it's going to be a bit of a rush to finish for those reviews, I think.
But I think they're like a games journalist's favorite studio, because they're founded in the mid-90s. They quickly pivoted into this zone of making narrative-driven action games. Their first game was Death Rally, which was not that.
It was basically a car combat game. But after that, they spend many years making Max Payne, make a Max Payne sequel, then spend many more years making Alan Wake, which went through a lot of teething pains for them to get that to where it wanted to be. And then since then, they've switched genres again to more of a sci-fi bent with Quantum Break, and then Control is kind of like a new, new weird game set in sort of like brutalist office space, a very different setting again.
And then Alan Wake 2 is a return to something that you sense is a real passion project for the studio. So they've been, they make singular games and they've managed to retain their identity through some real ups and downs in the industry, which is really interesting. So where I wanted to start with was what were the first Remedy games we each played?
I think this is probably quite predictable, but I'd like to talk about our entry point for the studio. So Matthew, start with you. Max Payne, was that your first interaction with Remedy?
Max Payne, read the glowing review on PC Gamer and became instantly obsessed with the idea of it. I know, I think we talked about this a little bit when we did the Max Payne, did we do a Max Payne episode?
Yeah, we did one and two, and then we replayed three for the episode.
Three, that was right, yeah. This was at the time where, for me, any game that did bullet time seemed like the most exciting thing in the world, and the pitch that someone had done it, and all the language being thrown around it in the reviews, that it was pulling from Hong Kong action films and had all this John Woo energy, and also it was really cutting edge. That's always been a part of their DNA, which I'm sure we can talk about, but games didn't look much better than this in 2001, so it was just an absolute must buy.
Absolutely loved it, and likewise with 2 soon after.
Simon, what about you? Was this, Max Payne, your first entry point? Did you play this on PS2 at the time?
It was, I played it a couple of years, so Max Payne was my first one, but I was quite, what was it, 2001, Max Payne came out? I was only nine when it came out, so I waited a few years. I was probably more like 12, 13, when I played Max Payne for the first time, and I still thought it was great.
I thought the slow-mo was really cool, but I don't think I was old enough to really fully appreciate it yet, or what it was doing with the noir-ness of it, or the cinema of it all until I played it a few years later after that, and I had all of the background and more understanding of film and stuff like that. At the time I first played it when I was 12 or 13, I was like, oh, it's cool doing all this in slow motion. So I guess the first one I was old enough to appreciate properly when it came out was Alan Wake, but Max Payne is the first one I technically played, but I can't say at that point I was like, yeah, Remedy are the best, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, that makes sense. I think I was 13 when Max Payne came out, and I did play it on PC at the time, and it was, I think it was just, it was so stylistically different. First of all, it was like a third-person shooter on PC, which was like, third-person games were maybe slightly more associated with consoles at traditionally that point.
It was the home of first-person games, so there was that, but obviously the sort of bullet time and the precision of the gunplay meant that it was perfectly at home on PC. It was just extraordinary. The bullet time thing tickled that part of my brain when The Matrix was still the biggest thing in pop culture.
Even two years later, it was obviously a massively important and influential film, so I was exposed to it first at that point, and it was immediately besotted with the studio. I would say actually when I became a games journalist, Alan Wake was something I was curious about, but I remember when it got to 2010 and Alan Wake was releasing, that was when I went through a hard remedy phase. I played Max Payne 1 and 2 back to back.
I hadn't played 2 until 2010. So it got massively into that. And Alan Wake just really struck a chord with me.
I can see why games journalists love their games. They're just so textured, the way they use pop culture and some of the other stuff we'll go into. But yeah, I found that when I got to my early 20s in particular, what Remedy does in their games just really, really seemed to hit the spot.
So I think I went through a similar thing, Simon, where you sort of mature into them a little bit. So Remedy is a publicly listed company in Finland with a lot of different dev teams, but we associate the studio with this strong identity of narrative design, distinctive settings and memorable characters. Why do we think they've managed to maintain that reputation throughout more than two decades in the industry?
Simon, I was curious what your take was on this.
I think they've always stuck to their guns, right? And they kind of have that through line of, I think Sam Lake's been there from Max Payne onwards and he's kind of, he's been involved in the writing of these games and they always kind of, they all feel one of a piece despite being quite disparate in genres sometimes. And, but the one thing I do love is they're just unashamedly Finnish as well.
Like they're not afraid to be weird. Like in an era when outside of like PlayStation Studios these days, we don't get a ton of like premium, purely single player, like story driven games. Like they commit to that.
And they're always kind of pushing tech, like I think Matthew mentioned earlier, like they're always kind of setting the benchmark for something like Max Payne to this day still looks pretty good for a 20 year old game, I think. And like Control, when it came out, it was like a ray tracing showcase. Like the reflections in that game are unbelievable.
And like even Alan Wake 2 now, like I'm not sure I've seen a better looking game than Alan Wake 2, like especially in the dark place, in this like haunted New York, like the lighting and like detail on those roads and stuff. It's absolutely astonishing. So I think it's that kind of combination of pushing tech, but also pushing story to weird places is what I think people are attracted to.
And not that they've ever been like critically like enormous, like they don't sell millions and millions of games, but like if you like Remedy, you're kind of always guaranteed to like something from their game, I think.
Yeah, I think so. They kind of make cult hits and then sometimes they break out a little bit. So yeah, it is an interesting profile they've accumulated.
Matthew, how about you? What's your take on Remedy's like enduring success?
Yeah, I'd agree with that. I think that it definitely helps that their games are very journalist friendly. You know, like I think that they've always been kept in the spotlight because they happen to make stuff which really resonates, you know, basically for all the reasons Simon listed, they work in like genre, which loads of people like, they make single player story action games, which are a bit of a dying form, but there's lots of fondness for them.
They always push their own tech, you know, they look graphically amazing. So any one of those angles is probably enough to catch the attention of most people who write about games. Like I often think these games feel bigger in their like media footprint than they probably are like sales wise.
You know, like they've never had like a massive, massive thing. You know, they've always done enough.
Max Payne was like a massive hit at the time. That was, that is the exception. So yeah.
So, you know, and so you can understand why that would establish them. I mean, probably for that reason, I'm not gonna say they've lucked out in like lifelines they've had from publishers and stuff, but the fact that like Microsoft were in their corner, sustaining them, you know, with the Alan Wake, the length it took to make that game, you know, would probably have killed most studios. But having them in your corner, why did Microsoft see in them?
Like I've never actually heard anyone from Microsoft really talk about it in any depth, but you'd think, you know, them being savvy would see that their games do have this like, this resonance, they will get covered, they will get talked about and that's kind of kept them in. What I'm more interested in now is like, this new phase we're going into, because they're suddenly branching out into like multiple projects, several of those are like multiplayer games, which isn't necessarily something we like, associate with Remedy, takes them out of their kind of comfort zone a bit. I am super interested what like, this phase two or phase three even, I don't know how they think about it, is gonna kind of play out.
Yeah, it's interesting as well, because I think for a little while, I think because Max Payne was so cinematic and obviously the way that comic book panels were used were so notable for the time, they've been sort of associated with transmedia a little bit, like the idea of branching out into having live action segments in their games or full on TV episodes in Quantum Break and Alan Wake being like literally TV episodes with basically like a sort of equivalent of a closing credits with music, like a different license track each time. So they've been associated for a long time with playing with the form of games, I would say, and the way that story is delivered. And it feels like they've entered this phase of maybe letting the game do the talking more.
Narrative is like still baked into it, but I don't think the way that the narrative is presented is as wildly experimental as it was. I think it's about like nailing the sort of whole package at once. That's kind of what the perception I get from where they're at now.
But yeah, Simon, I don't know if you have a take on that about how their relationship to sort of like playing with TV or movie style stuff has sort of developed over the years.
Yeah, I've kind of, I feel like they, for one reason or the other, went too far. When we go through their games and talk about it more, but like Quantum Break was kind of a turning point of like, did we go too far with putting TV stuff in this much? And they kind of scaled it back with control in a clever way, I think, by like overlaying live action stuff over some of the gameplay, but also reserving it more to kind of what Alan, to what Max Payne did with putting shows and like weird videos on TV screens.
I've always enjoyed that sort of stuff. And the way they play with meta in that way as well, like the famous like Alan Wake bits of like, you're in a video game and stuff like that, I've always enjoyed the weird little things they do. But even like the way they like mix music and like having like Poets of the Fall in all of their games, like being fictional bands, like in Alan Wake 2, Poets of the Fall play new gods, is it old gods of Asgard?
That's right, yeah.
They're in the original Alan Wake, but they're also the house band for the chat show in Alan Wake 2. So they're kind of incorporating them in like fun, weird ways like that. Even graphic novels, you know, that's where Max Payne started out.
It just, this constant mixing of mediums, yeah, is always something I've been drawn to. And the way they've layered Easter eggs and nods to other games throughout their games and now gone one step further with this Remedy-connected universe of Control and Alan Wake being an actual official thing, is just those two games, because those are the properties they own. And yeah, I think it's exciting where they're going.
And the thing is, I can't really predict where they're going because I wouldn't dare predict where a Remedy story would go.
Yeah, so that's probably a good transition point to talk about some of the trademarks we enjoy about their games, the things that strongly mark a game as a Remedy game and why they're so charming and why it makes them resonate with players. Purse of Fall is a good one. That's like, I know Sam Lake is like friends with the lead singer and they got brought in with Max Payne 2 to create the song, Late Goodbye.
So that was the start of that relationship and with the exception of Quantum Break, they've been in their games ever since to play. Their music plays a huge role in both Alan Wake and Control and the poets, the full bit in Control is fucking awesome. I think most people probably agree on that.
I think it's also the weirdo side characters. They like oddballs who you encounter along the way, memorable oddballs. That's like something that feels like they're, they may be lifted from David Lynch a little bit and particularly in Alan Wake because they're, obviously Twin Peaks is a really obvious reference.
But I think in general, some of the weird gangster characters you'll encounter in Max Payne or some of the oddballs who are in Control, like that cleaner guy, for example, just people, Jack the Janitor, just like odd strangers and sidekicks and things like that. I think that that marks Remedy games in an interesting way. Obviously the in-game media stuff we talked about.
I think as well, they like the signature big mechanics that drive each game. So bullet time in Max Payne is a really obvious one, the light and dark in Alan Wake, the emerging power set and control that really transforms the game as it goes. And another thing I actually wanted to raise as well is that I think that all of their games are kind of horror games in a sense, but you're unlikely to ever describe them as such.
Do you have a take on that, Simon?
Yeah, and up until Alan Wake 2 now, which is firmly survival action horror, I think. I'd agree, their games up until now all have that sense of whether it's weirdness or unease. You've never called Twin Peaks a horror, right?
But it definitely has horrific elements to it. And they've kind of, yeah, they have even like, Max Payne is a film noir action game, but has nightmare sequences that are definitely delving into horror. So yeah, that's what I've always been.
I think, yeah, like I said, that mature element to their games, but also that childishness to it as well is what draws me. It's just kind of like a delicious combo that I kind of, it speaks to me. It's what I look for in films.
It's what I look for in games. And yeah, I'd agree, like that unease is kind of what I enjoy, so to speak.
Yeah, absolutely. Even when the genre is otherwise seemed quite far apart, like you wouldn't really conflate noir with horror necessarily. But yeah, it's something they managed to pull off.
So, okay. Well, that's a good point to talk about their games one by one then. So we're gonna talk about most of the major ones here and then we'll get to Alan Wake 2 at the end, obviously, and talk about Simon's time playing that.
So Death Rally, I thought I mentioned briefly their first game, apparently developed in the basement of one of the devs when they first started out. Yeah, like a car combat top-down game. I played this on iOS very briefly.
It came out in 2011 and it was when I was massively into my remedy phase. I think I played it for about 40 minutes and thought it was fine. Matthew, do you ever play this one?
It's like Micro Machines with guns, right?
Basically, similar deal, yeah, yeah, but yeah.
No, I don't, I've watched bits of it. I don't think I've ever actually played it.
It's like Mad Max Payne, essentially.
Yeah, basically, yeah.
No, I am a fraud, I'm a Remedy fraud. I've never played Death Rally. Not even, I think it was originally, was it a DOS game originally, I think?
Yeah, that's right.
But yeah, not Dross, DOS. I haven't played it, but I've watched enough of it to know exactly what it is, if that's not too harsh on it.
I think that's fine. Obviously, real heads know that Death Rally is the best Remedy game.
It is the best Remedy game, yeah.
Okay, so Max Payne, 2001. I did a little bit of research on this, actually. I saw something I'd never seen before, which was a 1998 E3 demo for this.
I didn't realize quite how long this was in development. It was a long, long time. Basically, something I didn't realize about it.
Obviously, bullet time was something they added a little bit later. They would retool the game after they showed this trailer, but something that's in there is that it suggested the Valkyr drug that's at the heart of the game, kind of like weaves a bit of Norse mythology into the game, was actually like some kind of super soldier kind of drug. And you see Max Payne fighting this like enormous dude with like a tiny head and giant muscles.
And it had like a kind of like government conspiracy angle to it that they obviously excised in the finished product. Yeah, that was something I'd never seen before. Simon, have you ever seen that before, that video?
I haven't, no, and I want to now.
Yeah, it's quite bizarre. Like a lot of the other Max Payne elements are in there, like the graphic novel stuff and things like that, but they obviously, they did a lot of work getting the game right. I feel like we talked about this a little bit now.
You can see a bit more of the sort of 3D Realms Duke Nukem vibe to some of those. It's much, much kind of game here. Doesn't have the sun, the kind of sophistication of the final thing, some of those early shots.
But it is also interesting that they have had several times, it's taken them a while to kind of like find the game a little bit. Maybe it's their process, I don't know, or maybe it's just projects, you know, projects circumstances changing along the way, but arguably it happens with Alan Wake and Quantum Break as well, where the final thing isn't quite what you thought it was gonna be, to start off with.
Yeah, they're definitely, they're not massively prolific considering how long they've been around. And yeah, it's interesting that it starts just so early. They did a lot of work to get New York right, they went on a trip with some ex-NYPD bodyguards, apparently, to take lots of reference photos.
And I'm actually like, I'm always fond of like media that's about, that's like set in America, but made either in another country or, you know, just that feels like it's through a prism of like some other culture. Do you know what I mean, Simon? Do you kind of get that vibe?
Yeah, I get that. It's like GTA, right? Like all those games there.
Yeah, they're through a prism, like you said.
Hyperreal. Yeah, absolutely. So Max Payne 2, The Fall of Max Payne, 2003, a more accomplished sequel.
So actually, maybe it's a good time, Simon, to talk about the feature you did with Sam Lake, because I was about to cite something I heard in it, which is that he basically went to learn screenwriting, is that right? And then came back and yeah.
In between Max Payne 1 and 2, yeah, kind of put his own spin in it. So yeah, the feature you're talking about will be live on IGN right now. You can check it out.
I basically asked Sam Lake to pick one favorite moment from each Remedy game that he's worked on and basically unashamedly ripping off a YouTube format there for games purposes, but it works. But yeah, he basically went to learn screenwriting between Max Payne 1 and 2. And although they're not too prolific, they did kind of not rush Max Payne 2, but it was out what, two years later?
So it was quite a quick turnaround. And I think you can kind of, you can see a development in the writing. Like Max Payne 1 has more, it's much more, not a ripoff, but you can tell you watched a lot of films and wrote like, like there's lines that basically sound like Scorsese lines from like Goodfellas.
Like they're like quite, like, I don't know, the cliched gangster stuff, but like he's getting more weird with Max Payne 2, I think. Like there's much more lynching stuff to Max Payne 2, I think, and the writing is more developed. And I think it helps a lot by the fact that Mona is such a great character, unlocks so much more of Max in the second one.
Like I went to actually ask about Max Payne 1, like is this, do you consider Max Payne a bad guy or a good guy? Like, is this the first video game where you played as the bad guy? Because I think he is, to an extent, he is kind of a bad guy.
Yeah, I think his whole thing is that once his family is killed, he's sort of like, he's beyond saving, basically. And it's just different degrees of, you know, the whole, as Max describes it in Max Payne 2. He's just, he's in like this perpetual state of sort of moral decline, basically.
And that never really ends. But I actually like, I still, I mean, I just love the character. I have a lot of fondness for him.
I don't ever reckon with his morality much. I find his, how self-centered he is fascinating. Some of the bad choices he makes in Max Payne 2 because of Mono and his obsession with Mono is, I don't know, you just don't see other video game characters doing that sort of thing, or like they don't bother to ask those kinds of questions because they're such like trad hero journeys for the most part.
But yeah, I don't know. Do you have a take on this, Matthew?
Oh, I never saw him as a particularly like evil person, just because he's fighting against such a blatantly evil organization and the circumstances of his life are quite tragic. I mean, I definitely liked him less by Max Payne 3, which obviously isn't Remedy's entry, but that combination of kind of tragic life story, plus like just the bad hang energy of a rock star protagonist makes it a lot less palatable there. I don't know, I haven't thought that deeply on the character of Max Payne in 1 and 2.
I was just, you know, just a sad man going on some rightful revenge.
So, yeah.
I do think that Max Payne 2 does get the dream sequences right or nightmare sequences, if you want to call them that. Like they're much more involved, I think, and much less annoying than in Max Payne 1, where you're just trying to balance on a red line that is far too difficult. There's some great nightmare sequences in Max Payne 2.
And I do think Max Payne 2 is still my favorite game of theirs, just, I think. I just love, I especially love how they use that fun house as a location and reuse it in two or three different fun ways, like the first time you don't fire a single bullet, the second time what you're setting off all the traps and then the third time it's on fire, I think. And it's just, it's such a great use of like, cause these aren't long games and they don't have too many different locations.
They're kind of samey looking. They look great, I think, but like, it's not too many distinct locations, but they managed to make this one location feel distinct three times, I think is very clever. And yeah, just great, great level design.
That's one thing Remedy have always had as well. There's always like, their games always have a whole like that one standout level that like, you're like, yeah, that was really cool. They did something I've not seen before.
And yeah, I think it starts, it starts in Max Payne 1, but 2 is really where that takes off, I think.
Yeah, it's, I think one of the interesting things about them is that a lot of the techniques that really wowed in Max Payne 1 and more so too, like the dual character, you know, surprise protagonist change at times and you know, like that theme part, you know, just having a surreal level for you to explore in several different ways and all the kind of in-world media, like a lot of that stuff is a lot more commonplace now. Like the Remedy's box of tricks has been kind of co-opted by so many other people. Like, you know, we often talk about Naughty Dog and the kind of Pat the Ox phenomenon of the non-action narrative set piece, which I feel like I saw like the first versions of those in Remedy games and now Remedy are competing with like everyone doing that.
And so, you know, I am interested to see what the next thing is, you know, like their trademark is, it's not tired, but it's definitely a lot more overcrowded than it used to be.
Yeah. I think, I actually think like a lot of what they did was partly pioneered by Half-Life. That was one thing.
Yeah, but maybe the third person perspective changes like your read on it.
Yeah, and the other thing is as well, like the in-game media element of it and the idea of like invoking Lynch, that was more novel at the time because the sort of like Twin Peaks revival movement that exists now, like Millennials fucking love Twin Peaks. It's just sort of like probably more popular now than it even was at the time. You know, not popular enough for them to bring it back a few years ago.
Like, I just don't think that was the case in the early noughties. I think a lot of that stuff, like you say Matthew, was just super fresh. They were, the way they were using that stuff was super fresh and also it was before, like I think pop culture reference overload happened to a lot of media.
So that's a key thing. The way they use, the way they build their own sort of like in-universe TV shows as well. It's quite unusual.
I would say that's where some of them may be like their more specific finish sense of humor comes from too.
Lords and ladies, absolutely a banger.
Yeah, well that was the interesting thing that Sam Lake talked about in your feature, actually, Simon. He seemed to identify that the key moments were the same ones that a lot of people identify. Like that's what I kind of noticed is that, particularly his Alan Wake choice, which was the big concert battle.
I think that's what most people remember about the game. And it seemed like he seemed to have a similar fondness to what the players remember too. Lastly, I'll say about Max Payne 2 actually.
I think it does, it's really easy for you to pair these two games, Max Payne 1 and 2, but I think that when you've played 2, you remember 1 through the prism of 2 and Max Payne's narrative is not nearly as in depth nor is the in-universe storytelling, any of that stuff. It's a really top line version of what 2 does. I think people forget just how much more writing there is in 2 and how much more there is effort is paid to characterisation and how the story lands.
So that's my last point in there. Anything more to say on Max Payne 2, Simon, before we move on?
Ah, it's brilliant.
Yeah, the shooting's great. Lots of good havoc physics as well. Just things collapsing everywhere, that's real good.
There's one bit I just think I remember this, the first time I played it, it probably wasn't as revolutionary as I thought when I first played it. It's near the end of the game where you're just playing and the whole ceiling collapses around you. I was like, this is cool.
Yeah, big havoc physics time.
I like how it basically ends with a Bond villain boss battle. It changes into a different game in the last five minutes, but I'm big into it.
Yeah, and I love that villain as well, mocking Max for being so miserable, and he's just dying because he's so sad. I love that as a thing for a villain to say. Okay, so it's then seven years before Alan Wake releases and Remedy return.
In that time, obviously, they step away from the Max Payne series, which has been sold to Rockstar at that point, and they have a bit of money to basically figure out what they want to do next. They pitch this game where basically a Stephen King-style horror author's creations come to life to haunt him in a Pacific Northwest, Twin Peaks-style setting. It's announced for PC and next-gen consoles before Microsoft picks up the rights not too long after it's announced.
So a lot of people kind of like see this game in a 2005ish time, and then it's like a long time before the actual game emerges. It is like, Talton is an open-world game with a day and night cycle, and they have a lot of pain in figuring out what the actual shape of it is before they come across this episodic, linear, narrative shooter horror action game. It's a little bit of a dicey journey.
But the resulting game, it's funny, actually, I remember the critical reception to Alan Wake being like, not mixed, but I don't think people were, not everyone was absolutely in love with it. And then I feel like its reputation has exponentially grown over time. Matthew, do you ever take on that?
After that long wait, there was a sense of, not, oh, is this it? But sort of, is this it? You know, like the original pitch of like, it was gonna be a bit more open world feeling.
You could sort of sense a slightly troubled development in the final thing, where actually, you know, the bits everyone does remember and the stuff which really resonates and the stuff they've continued to do, it's a lot more authored, it's a lot more kind of controlled moments, it's set pieces, it's, you know, the stuff which is a bit of a pain is like navigating natural environments that are maybe a little bit too big to like evoke the kind of horror that's meant to be taking place in them or... I always forget, does Alan Wake 1 have vehicles?
There is one sequence, yeah.
Right, and that's like this weird hangover from when this was gonna be driving around this kind of big area and, you know, I remember the original pitch of the game and being incredibly excited for it. So when it finally came out, maybe what I'm doing here is actually just projecting what I felt onto the general discourse. But I remember being very, very excited for the original pitch, disappointed that it didn't look like we're gonna make it kind of relieved that it did finally then come out, but was surprised that it was quite a, I would say straightforward horror game with some cool kind of interactive cut scene moments along the way.
So I was cool on it, but I definitely, when I replayed it for Remastered, felt that thing you just were talking about, Sam. I definitely appreciated it a lot more the second time around. Maybe I just vibed with his pop culture references.
Maybe I'd got over the hump of expectations and knowing what it was gonna be. The art of its interactive cut scenes and being in this weird story and trying to work out what was gonna happen next, you know, that stuff is all great. And I think if people were cooler at the time, it was just kind of recalibrating their brains to like what Remedy were actually doing.
Yeah, also Red Dead had just come out. Simon, what's your relationship with Alan Wake?
It kind of came out at the perfect time for me, I think, because I was 18 and a TV production student, semi-prudentialist TV production student, was deep into Twin Peaks. Probably Fort Mulholland Drive was the best film I'd ever seen at that point.
Did you get the Twin Peaks DVD when it came out?
Yeah, like the big gold case. Yeah, I think I still got that somewhere. Yeah, and it kind of hit on all those notes man.
I absolutely loved it when it originally came out. And I did play the remastered, what, a couple of years ago now. And I still love the story and the writing and the tone.
I think it has like an almost unmatched sense of place that Bright Falls and the surrounding area, Cauldron Lake and everywhere around there. But I did think it was a slightly tough hang in terms of gameplay and just doesn't, like Max Payne and Max Payne 2 play better than Alan Wake do, I think.
I agree.
And it's almost like that hangover of they want to make this really moody horror game, but our roots are in action shooters and we want to still make this an action shooter or that's what we know, so we're going to do it. And it doesn't quite gel, I think, and just the waves and waves of these enemies and the gameplay that just is fundamentally interesting using the light to like burn away the shields and then getting satisfying headshots. It's kind of semi in between Max Payne and Resident Evil, whereas Alan Wake 2 has gone like full in on the more Resident Evil angle.
And it just, yeah, didn't quite gel those waves of enemies.
It just, it looks spectacular in a 15-minute E3 demo.
Yeah.
Because I can remember when they showed the first proper bit of gameplay at E3 thinking, oh, holy hell, like that is one of the best, if this is how exciting this game is in 15 minutes, imagine what the whole thing's going to be like. And it was just that 15 minutes.
Exactly, for 10 out of like, it doesn't really evolve that game. Like you get the flares, they're fun to use a couple of times, but yeah, it doesn't evolve its gameplay. There are, like I said, really cool moments, that concert that goes off and all the fireworks are shooting off and there's tons of enemies.
That is cool if the rest of the game, I think, wasn't waves and waves of enemies. Like, isolated, that is a great scene, but like you've kind of been doing it for six hours up until that point already. The stuff I did connect with most is the weird sort of like nursing home, like psychiatrist stuff, which they kind of bleed into control a bit.
And that is where I, like the more horror elements of Ix, it wasn't really a full horror game. It was an action game, really. Like it doesn't have too many jumpscares, but again, it won't be too down there.
I do love its story, I think, very well written and still looks pretty good, but yeah. It is kind of, I think it's their game that's aged the worst, but still is very good. Like I don't think they have a bad game, but like, well, we'll get onto one that isn't quite as good in a bit.
But yeah, I still love Alan Wake, but I feel like maybe I've been spoiled by Alan Wake 2 now, kind of fulfilling all the promises that were seven years in the making for Alan Wake 1. Like you can feel like Alan Wake 2 is kind of what they were going for in Alan Wake, and now they have the tech and the time and the kind of experience in writing these and making action games to fulfill that finally.
And I think I still really admire the specificity of Alan Wake as a character, as a world. Like it's, you know, just at the time there wasn't really anything else like it. I found it easy to celebrate because it was just such a bizarre proposition compared to other blockbusters of the time.
And yeah, so I do agree though that the mechanics, it feels like a game cobbled together out of different pieces. Like it feels like it would, maybe the light and dark thing would have made more sense in a day and night cycle kind of scenario where basically you fight until dawn in a very specific survival game kind of way. And then like when dawn comes, the monsters go away.
And instead it's just, those mechanics never really develop that much. It's just relentless, breaking the armor of enemies with light and then clearing out waves and waves. And I think that lack of a sort of like high skill ceiling and the repetition is the thing that's aged it the most.
I agree with that.
The most challenging part of your game shouldn't be trying to find batteries. And that's what a lot of that game boils down to is wherever the battery is.
Yeah, absolutely. So there is a semi-sequel to Alan Wake in 2012, Alan Wake's American Nightmare, AKA the song that, sorry, the game that makes you ask, is the song Clubfoot by Kasabian actually a banger? Because I wasn't massively into that song when it released in the mid-noughties, but this game uses it quite well.
This game, this standalone game is kind of like three to four hours of new Alan Wake stuff. And it doesn't really push the story forward that much, but I think it captures everything that Alan Wake does well in miniature, adds a few more mechanics. Alan's got this like drill, sort of like attacking it.
It's got quite a cool spin on horde mode they throw in there. There's also a couple of really good Old Gods of Asgard tracks in this too. But I think Balanced Slave the Demon is their best one, their best fictional Poets the Fool song.
I really love that song. And it did just remind me, oh, Alan Wake was cool and I really liked Alan Wake. But I don't think there's loads more to it than that.
Simon, do you have a take on this one?
No, it's kind of like, I suppose it's their first fully fledged go at live action as like full scenes. Rather than like in world. And I do think it's kind of, it's got a cool looping nature and it kind of builds more of like the hell that Alan Wake finds himself in of trying to escape this dark place.
And I don't know how essential it is. I feel like it's almost semi-essential for Alan Wake 2, if you haven't played it at least, to watch the cut scenes of American Nightmare. Cause like there's a key character called Mr. Scratch, who's this really like swarming, menacing like version of Alan Wake, who features heavily in American Nightmare.
And there's stuff with his wife that's... But there's some really good story stuff in there. I agree.
It doesn't really add much more gameplay wise to Alan Wake apart from the nail guns quite good. It wasn't included in the remaster, which is a bit weird, isn't it? You think they would kind of package it up maybe.
Oh, that is weird. I did mean nail gun, not drill by the way. That's just me misremembering there.
I wasn't picking you up on it as far as I know.
No, it's essential for continuity. So yeah, that's good. I'm glad you got slightly fresher memories of this one than me.
I remember shortly after this being marked with, I think they did a weird Raiders of the Lost Ark ending style video where they're like, Alan Wake is going away for a while now, that's it. Then it was kind of like they shut the door on that and moved on to something else. But yeah, I think I'm going to need a proper recap of what happened to Alan Wake before I played the second one.
Oh, well, luckily on ign.com as part of IGN First or YouTube, we got Sam Lake to recount the whole of Alan Wake's story up until Alan Wake 2. I asked him to do it in five minutes, he took like 17 to do it. Yeah, the whole story from the man himself is available.
Excellent. I will actually ask Simon, it's a good time to ask, have you seen the slow jam video of Sam Lake talking about the music of remedy on stage at some Finnish event? Have you seen that video?
That's one of my favorite remedy sort of like artifacts. They've got their in-house composer whose name I cannot remember. Sorry, that's me failing on my part there.
But yeah, basically the music of Max Payne, Alan Wake and Quantum Break, and I don't think Control was available at that point, is all playing in the background while he's sort of like doing sort of spoken word.
I'm making a list of things I need to check out.
It's really good. It's really like just, again, makes Sam Lake seem incredibly endearing. I'm very fond of that video.
Okay, so after that, they pitched to Microsoft and Alan Wake 2 and Microsoft doesn't want that. However, they do end up teaming up with them for another project. So next up in 2013, when the Xbox One is revealed, Remedy's next project is also revealed and that is Quantum Break, a third-person shooter involving some kind of like time-based mechanics, but also having a TV show element attached.
Very much felt like it was of the moment of this Microsoft push into entertainment, they never really turned into anything and it felt like in some ways, Remedy was a great fit for this and in some ways, it felt like it created a bit of a rod for their back in terms of the game they would make. So 2016 it takes for them to bring this game to market and at that point, it's changed protagonist a little bit. They've hired Sean Ashmore as the main character, Jack Joyce, who had previously revealed a main character when they revealed the game in 2013.
They changed that up. Otherwise, the shape of the game seems similar, but it had this all-star cast attached to it. An interesting one in the sense that it has TV episodes in there that change based on choices in the game.
However, the TV episodes are quite a tough watch, I would say. And even though the game is mechanically not bad, it's alright. It maybe feels like a bit...
The whole thing is kind of like a little bit lukewarm despite having some of the kind of like weird and cool Remedy energy, some amazing looking environments and set pieces and things you would typically associate with Remedy. But I think the TV issue aspect is just such a... drags the whole thing down a little bit and is quite hard viewing and just takes you out of the game experience itself.
It's a bit of an interesting but failed experiment. Is that a fair way to describe Quantum Break, Simon?
I think so, yeah. I do think it's their worst game, but I still think it's pretty good. I think there's a lot of redeemable stuff in there.
I kind of like... in many ways, they've always had these cinematic aspirations. Like, this is their tenet.
Like, it's an ambitious time travel story that kind of has a similar look to it, that just falls short. But I still kind of appreciate the audacity of it. They kind of did tenet before Christopher, don't they?
It's my... I finally got to manage to find a platform for this opinion, because I wasn't going to write a whole article on IGN about how Quantum Break is tenet. But I'm finally about to get it out.
I do think the game itself is quite good. The game parts... I do find the ability is quite fun.
The shooting, I do think, is quite solid. Like, it is a step up from Alan Wake. It does vary it and give you some new stuff.
And like you said, some truly eye-catching levels. Like, there's a bit where this whole shipyard is bending in on yourself. Very, like, Inception-like, again, like you can see the Nolan influence.
And the section on the bridge where, like, time just freezes and everything's, like, falling around you, like, still looks, like, incredible. And it's, what, seven years old? Like, amazing.
And I just think that, unfortunately, the TV show sections are just chronically bad. And it just lets it down. And I think a big part of this is, like, it was...
It doesn't... It just doesn't feel like Remedy. And the problem is, like, I think all these TV episodes, they were shot out in America, they were shot out in LA, whereas, like, from here onwards, the Control and Alan Wake 2 live sections are all shot in-house in Finland.
And, like, they were managed... They kept their vibe going, whereas these, like, the TV show, the aesthetics just don't match. Like, what you're seeing in the game doesn't look like what you're seeing in the show.
It had big web series energy.
Yeah, it's like a real, like, cheap version of 24 is what you're getting, really. And, like, there's some really weird moments. I listed a couple.
So I played this, like, three weeks ago. I had a week off, so I thought, well, why don't I replay out Quantum Break? So I did that, including watching all the TV shows, which I don't think the streaming service works for anymore.
So I had to download 90 gigabytes of television on my Xbox for this. There's, like, a security man who gets very angry that his egg is runny in his bacon roll. That's just not, like, a...
It's just not fun. And, like, there's a weird bit where, like, they're just at a party and he points... He's, like, talking to a woman.
He points at two very just normal-looking men and goes, oh, wonder what Gosling and Clooney are speaking about over there. This doesn't feel like it's written by Remedy. And it just...
It just feels weird and... It just makes me want to go back to the Sean Ashmore part of it because he's barely in the TV show. And, yeah, I do think there's a good game in there, but it's probably only about six hours, five, six hours' worth of game once you take out all the TV stuff.
But I do appreciate it, even though I know it's deeply flawed.
The really weird thing with the live-action series, the live-action episode component is, at least how I remember it, was that it was basically the story of another bloke about how he became like a mini-boss that you fight in an actual level.
And then you kill him in ten seconds and you're just like, oh, it's him.
Yeah, it's like an absolute nothing. I don't know if they thought this was going to be this big dramatic coup. We've told the story of this enemy, so it's going to really hit you hard when you have to fight him, because not at all.
Like, it barely registered that that's what was happening, you know?
Yeah, it massively reminded me of that joke in Austin Powers about the henchman who gets killed and then the bit with his family, the kind of cutaway. It's like that in sort of reverse, like a whole TV show. Yeah, it's like that.
I do really enjoy the look of it. And some of the enemy designs are really cool, how they have their own sort of time shifting powers. And you can see a lot of the basis control in that, I think, even like the colors and the red and like the way they move and float sometimes is very control-like.
My big problem with this was I thought it felt like, I thought there were three components to the games that felt like they'd been made by different teams. I thought you had the live action series. I thought you had the kind of puzzle exploration narrative bits and then you had combat sections.
And there was like no relationship between them. Like the combat, you could have removed it or you could have removed the narrative bits and just have the combat, you know, like the, the combat's fine. It's very flashy.
It looks great. You know, again, like Alan Wake, it kind of looks snazzy and that carries it, you know, for the length of game it has. But I swear, interviews at the time, they talked about the struggles of not really knowing what the kind of action component of the game was.
And they basically, you know, one of their big gameplay head guy had left and then came back. I think he was on the battlefield team for a while. And he basically came back to like come up with the combat system for the game.
And it really felt like that. It was kind of like, you can imagine that game without the 15 combat scenes it has.
Like, I suppose to like, Alan Wake's a bit clumsy in his combat, but it kind of fits the character because he's not trained. Like, Max Payne, it makes sense he can do all this because he's a trained New Yorker. Whereas like, just Sean Ashmore is just this dude who turns up and suddenly he's like a crack shot.
And like, it doesn't really make sense of, like, yeah, it doesn't all tie together.
Yeah, I know, particularly going to like, you know, we're going to get to control in a moment, but when they went into control, I felt like, oh, this feels like they knew what this whole game was from the outset. Like, it really, it felt quite complete to me. Where this, I just, this felt like a, we can never make a game like this again, moment for Remedy.
Yeah, it's just such an unusual product of its time, the TV show element in particular, of just, you know, that being like a concern for a hot minute. And this is the only artifact of that. And yeah, it also doesn't help that it launches in like basically like the death period of Xbox One, like 2016, tough time.
This was our big, I remember this being like one of the big first fight games when I was editing OXM. So we had to like really go heavy on it, but it just like, it just wasn't in the numbers. Like no one was interested when we put it on the cover and you were like, oh, this is going to be bad.
Yeah. Yeah. So interesting.
Yeah. Like I sort of, it's a, it really just feels quite turbulent. You can just sort of see, like you say, like just it doesn't quite cohere Matthew.
I think that's the right way to put it.
But on Simon's point, I do agree. Like I actually think as a time travel story, it's not bad. Like I actually quite like it as a bit of science fiction.
I almost wish they could just focus on like the in-game cut scenes where it's got digital actors are so impressive. You just didn't need to do that live action stuff.
Absolutely not. Yeah.
Yeah. That was going to be my last question actually, Simon. As someone who's played this very recently, do you think you can just skip the TV episodes outright and enjoy the game?
I don't. You could enjoy the game. You'd be.
I mean, you'd lose that great build up to that Binnie boss who you don't care about. You would be a bit lost because there are characters who are just like, they'd be in it for minute amount of time in the game. You're like, who is this doctor that I'm trying to protect?
Because she's in the live action for 20 minutes before that, and that's where you learn what she's really doing and stuff like that. I didn't try playing it by skipping it, but at the same time, I couldn't wait for those episodes to end, so I did consider it. Yeah.
I feel like you could just enjoy it as an action game, and you could get a decent time travel story out of it, because the crux of it is in the game. But yeah, I'd say you'd lose some of the personal connection, but they fail at building that. So yeah, you could probably do it.
Really just really interesting. Because logistically, it must have been so hard. Because obviously, making a game takes a lot longer than making a TV show.
So the idea of having to plan ahead on that, I can't imagine how complicated that must have been. But at the same time, it's nice to see that someone did this once. What would happen if you did have the budget to make some kind of transmedia project like this?
You can see there's a reason that game stories make sense when they're told inside the games themselves. So yeah, I consider this an interesting partial failure, I guess. Okay, let's move on to 2019's Control then.
So like a new weird game set in a big spooky office building, the FBC's old house building. Really kind of interesting setting, I think setting was a huge part of the appeal of this one. And you have a bunch of sort of like telekinetic style powers.
I think as Matthew, as you're alluding to, like the gameplay is put front and center here. I think setting is a huge part of it. Like I don't actually, the story, I think I've found the story interesting rather than like maybe as riveting as some of the previous Remedy games stories had been.
Matthew, what's your take on Control?
I liked it a lot at the time. Like I say, big step up mechanically. I felt the actual kind of like power curve and development of the character a bit more interesting.
I really love the powers. I've seen some people were a little down on this after the fact of that, you know, it can be quite simplistic. It can be a game where you just throw filing cabinets at people and over and over again.
And that's a very valid tactic, which kind of undermines the action. But in the moment, it feels very exciting for that first playthrough of kind of getting these new powers and then suddenly you're flying around and you really tear up these environments like all the crumbling rock. You know, it ticks the kind of the tech side of it.
It ticks the kind of visual spectacle, which I think is one of the hallmarks of Remedy. I agree with you on the central storyline, not really doing it for me, but I did like the more branching structure of like side missions. I really liked the objects of power.
No, the...
I think so.
Is that what they're called? Yeah, the kind of side missions that took you into the work that the bureau was doing. And you know, you end up having boss fights against like the fridge or like a weird lamp or whatever and the kind of puzzle rooms.
I thought they brought a bit more of the storytelling into the action, like the stuff you were doing and the environments you were in, there was a bit more environmental storytelling and I thought that worked. I couldn't actually tell you what happened in the main story. Like it was something about a man in a box, I think.
Yeah, one thing I was going to say, I should correct myself, it's not old house, it's the oldest house. I fucked it there. So I apologize for that.
Oh, that's alright. But yeah, I like to, weirdly, like I felt like it was, it has a bit of Metroid structure to it, which I always like, but I didn't think it completely landed it. This is a really minor nerdy complaint, but it had a lot of randomized loot.
So you'd find like a secret chest and you'd opened it and it would have like generic crafting materials or like a randomized mod for your weapon, which is not very satisfying in a Metroid game. You know, like it didn't, it didn't feel like I was kind of, you know, it's not the same as a health tank or a missile upgrade. You know, it, it felt a little kind of impermanent in a way, but that minor complaint aside, I thought this was pretty great.
There's some amazing spectacle in there as well. Like the, the, I think it's the former boss, like the big spidery monster thing with a giant eye. That's just like quite an amazing thing you have to go and see in this game.
But Simon, what about you? What's your relationship to Control?
I adore this game. Like this is, it's between this and Max Payne 2 is my favorite Remedy game. And I think Max Payne 2 is still my favorite.
I think that this is their most complete game to date. Alan Wake 2 aside, haven't played enough of it to say that, but I agree. I do think it's a landing of that core story away from being a masterpiece in my eyes.
Like it just doesn't land that story. It's kind of trying to make you feel about Jesse and her brother. And that kind of it just kind of confuses itself a little.
It gets a little bit tangled in. I just find the world and the weirdness of control and what's going on in that building more interesting than I do the main characters. I think that's the problem.
And I just I do really enjoy that like new weird version of like the X-Files essentially is what we're getting. And I also think, like you said, it does borrow smartly from other genres. Like it does have that Metroidvania structure, which I do think it mostly pulls off by agree.
Yeah, the loot is like not every game needs crafting. Yeah, this one definitely didn't. But it also has like the souls like elements of the checkpoints and enemies coming back.
But also, I think the most impressive thing about this game is its combat and like that almost like doom like nature to combat, where like attack is the best form of defense. Like you cannot heal unless you attack. So you get health back by damaging enemies and they drop these like blue cubes, essentially, which is what is health.
So you need to go on. You can't just like, it is like the antithesis of a cover shooter, which is what I love about it. Like it just wants you to be constantly moving.
Like it is frantic in the best way possible. Like I love the combat in this game so much. Like I would agree it's still like the best.
And I enjoyed Jedi Survivor quite a lot, didn't like Fallen Order a bit really, but quite enjoyed the sequel. But this is still like the best force powers in a game, I think we've had. And it just feels, it just feels so good.
And I can't wait to see what they do in Control 2. We've already got it like Control bleeding into Alan Wake 2 in ways, but I feel like, and it still looks incredible. Like yeah, I just, I can't really heap enough praise on Control.
I think it's near a masterpiece, but not quite there.
There's some very cool Remedy sort of like trademarks in there as well, like the Ocean View Motel, just the notion of that and the dream logic it operates on. Just like, that's just a really, you know, great sort of Remedy touch. I don't think that's something you would encounter in other games.
And it just, it really worked for me. Again, some of the side characters, very effective use of live action in the game. Also very effective.
I think they, like you say, Simon, even if you don't necessarily think the main narrative lands, they do a great job of creating that context and that setting with different various in-game materials. So, yeah. I think, oh, I also get the impression that it was a game that was a bit of a slow burn success, like maybe it just did okay in quite a competitive 2019 window.
Then loads of people played on Game Pass or PS Plus. And there was another version that came out, you know, obviously for next gen consoles. So I think people maybe discovered it like the next year and it was a big pandemic play for a lot of people.
It certainly was for me. So, yeah, please, they get to have another shot at it. Okay, we'll move on to Alan Wake 2 then, 2023.
So here we are, Remedy gets to return to one of their, what seems like a personal favourite for a lot of people at that studio. So Simon, what is the deal with this? And talk about your time playing it.
What is the deal with it? It is Alan Wake. It's a sequel to Alan Wake.
But no, it's much more, this is there. And I think they said this from when they first revealed it. This is Remedy's first full-fledged like dive into survival horror.
And you can tell that instantly really from playing it. I kind of want to be careful about this because they've done a lot of marketing around it. Like you can tell from looking at it, they're heavily influenced by Resident Evil and more importantly, like the more recent Resident Evil, the remakes and like that over the shoulder perspective and the combat is very Resident Evil.
But this isn't a Resident Evil, like don't go into this game expecting a lot of action because the first hour of this game, you don't fire a bullet. It is very much tone saying, it is as much a game trying to be true detective as it is a game trying to be Resident Evil. And that's what I love about it.
I do worry it will turn a lot of people off who are like, oh, I thought this was a horror game with like zombie monsters, whereas in fact the first hour I'm walking around a forest looking for clues and stuff like that. So that's why I, the sense of tone in this game, I think Remedy are kind of unmatched in that kind of creating that sense of place and a world where just weirdness is like commonplace and there's just so much weirdness in Alan Wake 2, they're continuing that Twin Peaks vibe but definitely more in a horror way with the Alan Wake side of it. So you've got dual protagonists in Alan Wake 2.
So it's not just Alan Wake, he is, Alan Wake himself is trapped, still trapped in the dark place like he is at the end of Alan Wake 1 but this dark place kind of takes the image of a really like taxi driver like horror version of New York where the shadows are walking around and it's much, that side of the game is much more tense, it is much more Resident Evil like and I haven't seen as much of that side of the game yet, I've spent much more time with Saga who is the new protagonist who is essentially a detective come to town to Bright Falls to investigate some like ritualistic cult killings that are very true detective season one and her elements do have combat but they are much more detective and like caseboard based so you're like moving around clues, talking to people, there is almost a bit of point and click nature to it and Resident Evil have puzzles but these puzzles The puzzles are kind of a step above the simplicity of Resident Evil, I think. And from what I've played, I've played like the first, what, three to four hours, so I've seen a bit of both sides. I just, I can't wait to play more.
I would love to have finished the game by the time we're talking here, but to have a complete sense of it. But from what I've played so far, like it's exactly what I would want from this game. I don't know.
Remedy Connected Universe of it was very interesting to you mentioned like the janitor for control, like in an early mission of Alan Wake 2, he pops up. He's just doing karaoke in a local Finnish bar in Alan Wake 2. So you're kind of like, oh, so they are going full like blending.
It's not just like little notes on walls anymore. They're like Easter eggs. This is a full blending is universe.
One of the agents from the SBC like turns up in Alan Wake 2. So they're fully like blending these stories. But there's also weird, like they're still doing the weird nods to other games that aren't in this Remedy Connected universe.
Like Sean Ashmore is in Alan Wake 2 and he plays a character called Tim Breaker, which is just like Time Breaker. Like they're fully just laughing it. I don't know if they're laughing at us or just laughing at themselves.
That's like some Kojima bullshit.
I know. But like, I kind of appreciate it. It's just like they could have called him in and to be fair, Sheriff Breaker is a character from the original Alan Wake.
So Breaker was already an established family name in this. But the fact they called him Tim, it's like you went as close to time as you could there, didn't you? Yeah.
I just I do love it. And yeah, who knows? The last like this is the longest game today.
I think it's like 15 to 20 hours, which is quite long for a horror game. The only worry I have about this game is how do they that's the problem of the original Alan Wake, right? It didn't develop that combat or that gameplay in significant ways.
Like what have they got up their sleeve? Like, I've heard rumors of some very weird stuff like control level, ashtray maze level sort of stuff going on in this, which is what I want to see. So I'm hoping that's where these sort of things happen to mix it up.
But yeah, my only worry is I just I never really doubt remedy yet. But my worry is how do they evolve it over that stretch of time? By the time this podcast out, reviews will be out and we'll know probably.
But that's what I'm thinking about at the moment.
The thing I'm kind of curious about and probably hard to get a read on this from the amount you've played is like, I like David Lynch stuff, but I'm less into really like dreamy or like nightmare logic stuff like that isn't that is I'm not into like super sort of ambiguous horror. You know, I like I like things to have quite a clear finite ending and like the end of Alan Wake 1 takes you into like, well, this is going to you know, this is we're in kind of like weirdo realm now and things are all going to be very strange and definitely in what they've shown of it so far, the idea of a saga campaign is maybe a bit more grounded. Is that right?
I think that's fair. Yeah, it definitely has some weird stuff, but that's definitely like every movie said it is very true. It's very seven.
Like they've always had this sort of Fincher influence, I think, in all their games, like even the original Max Payne, like he's wearing Brad Pitt's clothes basically from seven.
Right.
So like, they still have it does have that sort of like Max Payne noir sense of it as well, which I really like. Like, it is less like you do visit Bright Falls and there's some very Twin Peaks characters there. But so far, it does feel more towards the Stephen King, True Detective, like noir Fincher sort of side than it does the Lynch sort of side to things.
I just want it to have a proper ending, you know, I don't want them to get pulled too deep into this connected universe that it just becomes like a stepping stone to something else.
I know what you mean. It doesn't want to. Yeah, you don't want this to be a tease for Control 2 and then Control 2 is a tease for Alan Wake 3 and so on.
That's my only fear from this talk, but you know, they've been doing this connected universe stuff years before they formally named it. So I'm confident they're not going to like shit the bed.
I can't wait to play more. I just, it just, and like I said before, like this is until you like play, I think at home like on a screen, like not just watching it for YouTube, I understand just how stunning this game is to look at is unbelievable. Like, when we were there in the studio, they had a lot of work to do, but they were like, even like the minutest details, like making sure that there's a little like mole or bump on Alan Wake's face, making sure that had the correct shadow, like on his face.
So like a mole was creating a shadow on his face, like no one is zooming in that closely to see that. But they're just, they're kind of like perfectionists in that way. And I just hope, like you said, they've been working up to the wire.
I hope for them that it launches in a good state and a finished state because I think it'd be such a shame if it didn't.
Yeah. I think what is interesting is to me, it feels like they've been positioning it as the ultimate remedy game. And the fact they have epic megabucks behind them would suggest they have the resources to make their most complete game yet.
Like I think, I think it is fair to say that control is the whole package in a lot of ways. I think it's maybe like not massively expansive, you do go to the same few places over and over again, I think is one way you maybe see the restrictions in control, whereas this kind of feels like they're, they're just, it's a little bit remedy unleashed with the way they're sort of positioning it and not, you know, the Connected Universe element is one thing, but it's just, yeah, it's just how it looks, how it's been presented so far. And the fact that it's as long as you say, Simon, that's, that's, yeah, that I mean, it just feels like there's, there's maybe, there may be positioning this as this is our ultimate masterpiece in a lot of ways, you know, this is, accumulates everything we've done to date.
I think Sam Lake kind of sees it in that way, but I feel he connects most to Alan Wake as a character from speaking to him. That's like his baby is Alan Wake, despite Max Payne being the game and the character that made their name, Alan Wake's the one he relates to. Maybe it's because he's a writer.
I don't know. This is the one I feel like there was always unfinished business with Alan Wake 1 for one reason or the other, and they're finally doing what they want with this one, and it's all very exciting.
Okay, great. Well, the last thing I was going to discuss very briefly then is what they're working on next. Remedy seems like they're always in demand, and they've had a few projects they've announced and have been bubbling away in the background for a little while now.
A Max Payne 1 and 2 compilation that's a ground-up redo, they're hiring a narrative director for that. I just saw on their website suggesting it will be more elaborately presented than just comic panel cutscenes you might expect after two decades since Max Payne 2 released. But that's quite an interesting prospect.
I assume that's what the Alan Wake 2 team will default on to after this, I mean that's just a guess, but we're just really intrigued by the idea of them revisiting the game that made their name. Do you have any thoughts on them doing that, Simon?
Yeah, I can't wait. Despite playing both 1 and 2 recently and saying they still look great and they play great, just thinking those stories with a new look of pain. Playing Max Payne 1 and 2 with Alan Wake 2 graphics, I just can't wait for that.
And I even got a glimpse of that, Alex Casey is a character in Alan Wake who is played, the voice is James McAfee and the face is Sam Lake, wearing Max Payne clothes in Alan Wake 2. You've basically got a sneak peek of what Max Payne will look like in that engine. And yeah, I can't wait for those.
And yeah, not much more to say about that. But I also think they might do interesting, like the Rezzi remakes have done, like occasionally throwing a curveball your way and not one to one remaking. They're such a creative studio, I think wouldn't that bore them just to do a straight remake when they want to mix it up and like do something narratively interesting.
I don't know, I don't have any info there, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't just maybe Max Payne 1 and then 2 in an order, maybe they remix it in some weird way. But with time, I don't know, who knows.
Yeah, I think the key thing is as well, and I may have said this on a Max Payne episode, so apologies if I did, is that the specific type of shooting that these games did and that kind of action doesn't really exist anymore, so they haven't actually been bettered. So that is like one string to its bow, is that I think if they keep the gameplay mechanics even vaguely similar, which I assume they will, they'll end up feeling quite fresh to a modern audience, I think, because you're just not seeing other shooters really doing this now, so that's one thing. Matthew, any thoughts on this?
I'm curious about the Rockstar of it all, if there's any pressure to bring it a little bit more in line with Max Payne 3, perhaps? That added some stuff to the formula, had some slow motion set piece and you're like hanging from a hook or something, shooting like 20 guys in the head, you could bring it more in line with that. Hopefully it will go much beyond what they did in Max Payne 3.
Okay, so they're also making a straight sequel to Control, which is interesting, Control 2. Simon, I'm guessing this is a huge deal for you as someone who loved that original.
I can't wait. I think the beauty of, and it's not something they fully explored with Control 1, is that it takes place in this oldest house building, which is on the surface just this brutalist building, right? But it can transport you in theory to anywhere.
And they kind of, they delve into that a little bit with the first one, but it didn't really explore that. So that's kind of the exciting thing I have about Control 2 is like broadening outside of that building, especially now with Alan Wake 2, they've admitted to the FBC or out there in the world investigating things like what if it was just like a chapterized, like full on X-Files, like Monster of the Week sort of thing with her through line. That is kind of what I want from that anyway.
That's cool. So another thing they've got in the works is Vanguard, a co-op game with narrative in its core. I don't think much else is really known about this, but it was revealed two years ago as a partnership with Tencent, I think.
So I'm kind of curious to see what that's like, what you do when you have to present the Remedy-style narrative, but it's played in co-op. I think there's a big appetite for this kind of game, just based on how people enjoyed a way out and it takes two games from that studio. So yeah, like, curious to see the take there, but there's probably not much more to say because we don't know much more about it.
But I assume that is the next thing we'll hear about from them, just based on the timelines of that, but who knows, there's also a Control Multiplayer spin-off codenamed Condor, again, very little known about that. I'm not sure if there are any plans of that have changed since Control 2 was announced because I think maybe they'd roll it into one, but who knows what the deal is there. So yeah, okay, interesting future ahead for Remedy and I can't wait to play Alan Wake 2.
It does look incredible. The PC system requirements have smoked me the fuck out.
That's absurd, aren't they?
They are, yeah. It does have some nice mist and smoke effects and lighting effects and stuff. I'm like, yeah, am I going to play this at like 480p with my GTX 1080 Ti?
That feels wrong somehow. But yeah, thank you so much for joining us on this episode, Simon. Thank you.
I had a great time.
Yeah, it's been a pleasure having you. So where can people catch you on social media?
I am on, are we calling it Twitter or X? What are we calling it?
I prefer Twitter still.
Yeah, Twitter is good, isn't it? At Cardy Simon. It's just my name, but reversed.
Clever, isn't it? And yeah, that's pretty much. And the IGN UK podcast, if you want more nonsense, you know, check that out.
Rival podcast, why not promote that? And yeah, just on IGN. Yeah, good stuff.
Yeah, awesome. Yeah, I'll look out for more of your writing. You've done Spider-Man and God of War Ragnarok, right?
Have you become like the go-to Sony guy at IGN?
I did Forbidden West as well. Well, yeah, I've kind of come the default PlayStation big game. Not only through great design, I think, but yeah.
Those are my sort of games anyway. So yeah, it makes sense for me to do them. I don't know what's up next, but we'll see.
I look forward to your helldivers too.
Who knows?
Okay, awesome. So Matthew, where can people catch you on social media?
I am on Twitter at MrBazzle UnderscorePesto and BlueSky at MrBazzlePestoNoUnderscore.
Awesome. I'm Sammy W. Roberts on Twitter and BlueSky.
The podcast is at BackpagePod on both as well. You can also support the podcast at patreon.com/backpagepod if you'd like more episodes each month. And yeah, that's it.
Thank you so much for joining us and we'll be back next week.
