Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
We have another special guest this week. Our guest is outside Xbox's Mike Channell, who joined print media at a similar time to us. We're very grateful for Mike's time, and we're excited to ask him about his past working on magazines.
Mike, how's it going?
Pretty good, thank you.
Happy New Year.
Is it still fair to say Happy New Year? Probably not, but I'm gonna say anyway.
For two more days. For two more days, I believe.
I didn't realize this is an official date, but yes, anyway, regardless. I hope you're both well. And yeah, it's all good.
It's all good. Just getting my feet back under the desk as it were for 2025, trying to remember how to do my job, that sort of thing, basically.
The light psychic damage of the end of year rush has passed and yeah, things are on the up again. Yes. Yeah, really grateful for your time, Mike.
Thanks for having me.
Definitely been on my wish list for a while. You know, got a lot to ask you about magazines, which is part of your history before, you know, it was noted that you were too damn photogenic to stay in print media.
Oh, I didn't know about that, I didn't know about that.
And then also, I just got some stuff to ask you about arcades as well, because you have, you know, that's a pretty rich sort of hobby for you these days. So yeah, excited to get into it. So Mike, what was your way into games and what are the key games that shaped your gaming taste?
So I think in terms of my way into video games as a kid, my dad was always big into kind of technology and always interested in computers and things like that. So we had an Atari ST from a very young age. I remember sort of sitting on my dad's lap playing those sort of early Atari ST games.
And that was my kind of entry point, was that very British sort of computing scene. I think it's probably, there's probably a statute of limitations now. And I can probably admit that we just had a ton of like pirated video games, you know, that kind of classic box full of floppy disks that people had when they had an Amiga or an Atari ST So, you know, I got to play a lot of games very early on.
I was very fortunate in that regard, because, you know, if we'd had to buy them all, I definitely wouldn't have had as wide a sort of breadth of genres and sort of different games to play. And then sort of as time went on, my dad always used to bring back computers and things from work. So I played like original sort of Apple Macintosh games at one point.
And he'd have a laptop, which I remember playing Dark Forces on, the Star Wars first person shooter. And so technology was always kind of in the house. And so I've had a sort of rich history of kind of PC gaming because we've always had a sort of a PC to play games on.
And then I dabbled in kind of console stuff as well. I had a SNES and a sort of PlayStation 1, PS2, things like that. So, yeah, a bit all over the place, which is good because I think it kind of...
That breadth of experience was really helpful when I was going into writing about video games when you might have to be the guy who reviews the basketball game because no one else wants to. So having played a lot of different games and genres, I think it really served me well in my journalism career.
Yeah, definitely. I think like all the most successful magazine people are generalists at heart.
Yeah, Omnivores.
Yeah, exactly. So what were the games magazines you read back in the day? Did they have quite a big impact on the way you engage with games and thought about games?
Absolutely huge. Yeah, massive. So I started off reading SD Format because again, we had this Atari ST My dad used to have a subscription to SD Format, so I read a lot of all that stuff.
Obviously, a lot of the technical side, but game reviews as well. And so that very much shaped my writing style. And then I moved on to Games Master magazine, which was a big deal for me because again, it was sort of multi-format.
I was never really big into the console wars, even in the 90s, even deep in the 90s, when the console wars were raging. So I loved Games Master because it was multi-format. If I couldn't play these games because I didn't have a SNES or Mega Drive at the time, I could read about all these games.
And I think also, I'm sort of aging myself a little bit here, but I would say like that period that we grew up in as kids, where it was the transition, if you look at the leap between the sort of 16-bit and the kind of 32-bit era, and the leap in sort of 3D graphics and things like that, I just think it was one of the most exciting times to kind of grow up around a game, you know, games as a concept. And reading Games Master was a way to, you know, learn about all these different things and be there for all the kind of breaking news as was pre-internet in terms of this generational shift in games. So Games Master was huge for me.
I actually, I found, I'm sure you guys know about this already, but there's a sort of little community of people who scan old video game magazines. They've got an amazing archive. You have to pay, I think, like, I don't know, 15 quid or something to gain access to it.
But once you have it, you can kind of, you know, you can download all these scans of all these old issues of Games Master. I actually went through and have been reading back through all the issues that I had. And it's really interesting.
Oh, wow. The sort of, the, you know, it's a really strange experience because you'll read through a magazine that you know you had and some of it you won't have any memory of whatsoever. But then you'll read a review and there'll be a turn of phrase that just suddenly clicks and you remember reading that, you know, whatever it was 30 years ago nearly now.
So it was, yeah, it's been really interesting going back. And also just, you know, reading through the news pages and seeing what the big stories were at the time, what they got right, what they got wrong, you know, the kind of speculation, all that stuff has been a real, really nice sort of archaeological sort of project. So yeah, I just sort of bang these PDFs on my iPad and just sort of lie in bed, reminiscing over the magazines that shaped me.
But I felt like as a result of reading future publishing magazines specifically throughout my sort of childhood, it all sort of almost felt like a homecoming when I eventually ended up getting a job at Future because it had educated me so much in terms of my writing style. And it was really interesting getting a job at Future. And some of the people who wrote for Games Master were still sort of hanging out.
You know, guys like Pete Wilton, who was a, you know, former editor of Games Master magazine, you know, I'd end up in the pub with him. And I'd been reading this guy since I was like 10 years old. So it was a really interesting sort of interesting dynamic.
I felt like I sort of I arrived at this kind of transitional period where I was kind of the new generation and some of the old guard were still kind of hanging out. Yeah. Which was lovely.
I like it when you feel starstruck and then you go out to them. You're like, Oh, I love your work, blah, blah. And their response is basically like, Yeah, I'm just some bloke.
Yeah.
And later on, I realized that, yes, I, too, was just some bloke. They were probably a bit confused by this kid going up and going, I loved your whatever review from Games Master issue, whatever. So, yeah, it was really fun.
But I think fundamentally, as I said, I think my writing style has been very heavily informed by future publishing magazines and that concept of, and I think this is something that's missing a little bit. I think what's missing a bit on the Internet at the moment is that idea of a piece of writing is a piece of entertainment as well as information. And I think that era of writing for magazines where you're asking people to pay money to read what you've written rather than just sort of throwing it out on the Internet for free.
I think it really instilled a sense of discipline in terms of, I should be writing something that is fundamentally entertaining and funny, as well as, you know, a good review.
Yeah, I agree with that. I think that in some ways it's easier to do that in video and podcasting and, you know, you folks certainly do that outside Xbox. But it's that thing where I think website readers now almost see it as confrontational when you try and be funny in a headline because they've gotten so used to writing styles that just don't really have jokes in them that are more informative and critical.
But yeah, I agree. It's something I miss too quite a lot.
I think, okay.
Where did you read Games Master up until like what kind of era?
So I think I probably read Games Master up until I would say like late 90s, sort of 98, 99 maybe. I started reading it in I think 1994 was the first issue of Games Master I ever got. So precocious child that I was, I was reading sort of voraciously as a kid.
And yeah, so the idea of an entire magazine about my sort of specialist subject, as it were, was just a dream. So yeah, I sort of absolutely devoured those issues. And yeah, read it for several years.
And then I would say, you know, then I kind of, I remember reading a lot of PC Zone, PC Gamer and things like that into my sort of late teens, I would say, and then, and PC Format as well, which is the place I would eventually end up working at future.
Because I think because of that, I always associated you with more PC than anything, obviously, that's kind of changed over the years because of OXM and outside Xbox. But yeah, so that's kind of, I didn't really know you had that, you know, as wide ranging kind of upbringing, I guess.
Yeah, and I think it was really interesting for me as a kid to be sort of exposed to kind of Japanese video games and things like that, you know, and that was the joy of Games Master. You know, I never would have been able to play these games. I would, you know, for a long time, I didn't have a console.
I was still playing my Atari ST, but reading about Super Nintendo and Mega Drive games, and PC games. And also, you know, I didn't know where my local import shop was. Do you know what I mean?
So a lot of these games seemed really sort of exotic and interesting. But yeah, then, you know, deep into the PC thing and eventually ended up at PC Format. And I think that was, you know, I think when you're a sort of late teenager, early twenties, you have a lot of patience for PC gaming.
And yeah, driver installs and, you know, cobbling things together and EMS and all that stuff. So I think around that time, I was reading a lot of PC magazines. And it was a really exciting time, you know, it was like kind of Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, that sort of era, which again, felt like a bit of a step, step forward.
And that's, you know, I was reading PC Format. And because of that, I ended up writing for them.
Yeah. No, it's just funny that where people end up and where you meet them, you know, the magazines they're working on, it's quite easy to sort of assume a lot of things about a person. Basically, you know, there's lots of people, you know, like, you know, to me, Rich Stanton will always be an edge guy because you happen to work on edge.
And, you know, I am a Nintendo guy in a lot of people's eyes because of my Nintendo background. And it's, yeah, I've always found that weird categorization thing quite odd.
Yeah, I guess I was one of the rare people who ended up starting on PC and ending up at OXM, which was obviously at the time the kind of biggest console magazine in the UK because it was right in the sort of Xbox 360's heyday. But normally, you know, it felt like a very different vibe going from a PC magazine and still writing, you know, tech stuff, writing reviews of graphics cards and things like that, which was another part of my job. But then, yeah, it's switching to sort of full video games, console, you know, big, big triple A games, you know, moving to London as well, you know, moving from Bath to London.
It was a big, a big change. I felt like I was meeting sort of all new people who were kind of in the console space. I'd gotten very well with the console folks at, you know, yourself included, Matthew, in Bath.
And, you know, we'd always socialized and stuff in the pub and things. But yeah, it definitely, definitely felt like that London was a sort of a foreign country almost in terms of the people you'd meet, the amount of events that were going on as well. I think that was a real revelation was just that, you know, there were always things going on in London, whereas I think in Bath it tended to be like people would come out and visit future publishing, you know, but all the big events and parties were kind of happening in London.
Yeah. When I take journalists out for a coffee now in Bath, I wonder if it feels quite exotic to them because no one comes to Bath now.
Yeah, you're right.
Post-pandemic especially.
Yeah.
Okay, yeah. So I suppose in that, Mike, you are quite synonymous with racing games. Yes.
You know, it's definitely like a passion of yours, you know, on the sim side, but, you know, just more broadly as well, arcade racing games. I was curious where that comes from, because that, you know, you describe yourself as a bit of a generalist, but that is your specialist subject within that, right?
Yeah, 100%. And that comes from a love of cars since I was a kid, you know, a very childish, you know, having a big box of toy cars and, you know, driving around the carpet. And then I got into sort of, I was interested in watching motorsport on TV.
So I'd watch some stuff on TV and get excited about that. And then I'd play the games. And it's really, it's always been kind of intertwined, like a real life interest in cars and motorsport and video games.
And they kind of fed each other. So I'm, you know, for example, I used to, I remember watching like the old rallies with the Lancia Delta. And obviously when Sega Rally came out, you got the chance to drive that.
And, you know, if you think about it as kids, and this is more specific to arcade machines, really. But, you know, as a kid who likes cars, probably the first time you, you know, handled a steering wheel and pushed pedals was, was on an arcade machine if you grew up around my era. So I got to play Sega Rally and drive these cars, even though I was 12 years old and far too young to drive, you know, so I think that was that kind of love.
And I think the arcades do play a really big part in that as well because they were spectacular. I mean, if you imagine those, those old model 2 racing games like Sega Rally and Daytona USA specifically was the one I think really sort of cemented my love of arcade games. They were spectacular.
I mean, they were running at 60 frames per second. They were fully texture mapped polygons. You know, this was not possible at home at the time.
And even when the PlayStation 1 came out, you know, it wasn't comparable really with the stuff you were seeing in the arcades. So I do remember, I did have a SNES by this point. And I remember we went to the sort of bowling alley and my dad gave me a quid to play Daytona.
I played Daytona. It was amazing. And then I remember going back home and getting the SNES out and playing a game called Street Racer and picking the sort of most realistic looking track on that, which was not exactly full of realistic tracks.
It was a mode seven Mario Kart ripoff basically. And I remember my dad sticking his head around my bedroom door and saying, it's not quite the same, is it? And it was absolutely true.
Was your dad into racing stuff?
Not as much. I mean, we had the F1 on, I feel like, every Sunday. It was kind of background noise.
But he was big into planes. You know, flight sims and things were his sort of main interests. So yeah, I think he had a sort of passing interest in it.
But the racing game thing really was sort of unique to me. So yeah, it's interesting how it shook out.
Yeah. So tell us a bit about PC Format. How did you get hired?
And what was it like joining that team at that time?
So in terms of PC Format, it was basically... So I was at uni, it was my final year of uni. And I actually, funnily enough, entered a motorsport journalism competition, which was sponsored by...
It was organised by a tyre manufacturer called Bridgestone. And the prize was to go... So the seven finalists from across Europe got to each go to a Grand Prix and write about it, report on it.
And then there was a kind of grand finalist. And I got to go to the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, had an amazing time, reported on that stuff, did, I think, a pretty good job as one of these finalists. And then, yeah, I eventually ended up winning the competition.
And I was an avid PC format reader at the time. And I remember buying in the airport, buying a copy of PC Format to read on the plane to Tokyo, which was the trip to the Tokyo Motor Show, was the big grand prize. Wow.
In the back of the magazine, there was a little box out that would have been really easy to miss, were it not for the fact that I basically absorbed every single word written in these magazines at the time. And it just said, we're looking for an intern. It's paid internship, back when those were a thing.
They needed someone with a relevant degree, which I had a degree in English language. I'd been in my final year of uni, the games editor for the student newspaper, so I'd been practicing writing reviews there as well, and actually funny enough to like talking to PRs as well. So the previous guy who had run it the year before, was just a guy who worked in game and he was using his 33 percent discount to buy games to review.
And I was like, well, this is understandable. I'm a poverty stricken student, can't afford to do this. So I just started phoning up PRs.
And I think the big moment for me on the student newspaper was when GTA San Andreas came out. And this is the day when people were queuing around the block to get into the game shop at like 9 a.m. to get a copy of GTA San Andreas on PS2. And I was sitting in the office of The Badger, which was the University of Sussex student newspaper, and a Jiffy bag popped in the post that morning and it had a copy of San Andreas on PS2.
So I was like, all right, this has worked out well. So I had a bit of relevant experience there. I had the relevant degree and I was a free agent, really, to be honest, because Uni had finished by that point.
So I applied for it. And I think in that sort of typical magazine team thing, I think my application came in during deadline, so I didn't hear anything for ages. I did follow up with the editor and was like, I'm really gutted to have missed out on this.
I assume it's not happening. And could you give me a bit of feedback? Let me know what I did wrong, etc.
And yeah, Adam Oxford was the editor at the time, rang me up. He sounded extremely weary, but he was like, yes, we'd like to hire you. And so that was late 2005, which means I'm rapidly approaching my 20th year.
Wow.
In the video game industry, which is slightly frightening.
Yeah.
But yeah, so I joined as an intern. I actually joined as a sort of half, I was editorial assistant. So I spent basically the two weeks of the magazine where everyone's writing furiously to try and fill pages, I was writing furiously.
And then I switched over to production for the two weeks where production stressed out their minds trying to get the magazine out. So I'd like amazing experience, but also the most hectic halves of both jobs. But it was a great experience.
And then I finished my six months, I mean, which at the time seemed like a long time, but now six months goes by in an instant. This is old men reminiscing, isn't it basically? But I got to the end of the six months and I was bold enough to say to Adam, look, they were like, we'd love to keep you on.
And I said, yeah, I'd love to stay on, but I just want to write. I have massive respect for what production do, and I still do to this day. I'm very respectful of production editors on magazines.
I write for Top Gear.Magazine and I'm terrified and in awe of the production team over there. But I just said, writing is what I want to do. It's why I came here to do essentially.
I think it's what I'm good at. I'm good at the subbing stuff fine, but I think I'm a decent enough writer. And thankfully, they agreed and I was brought on as a staff writer on a fairly modest salary.
But yeah, it was amazing. And you know, I was great in terms of the team, brilliant team there at the time, just fantastic writers. Alec Muir was there.
Obviously, later went on to found Rock Paper Shotgun. So he was great, great sort of, a kind of a writer I very much admired in terms of games stuff. Al Bickham, who was a brilliant writer as well, absolutely fantastic writer.
And you know, I think really interesting, because I'd spent obviously three years at uni, and I don't think Al ever went to uni, but he was one of the best writers I'd read. Do you know what I mean? So he was a really interesting sort of, you know, case study for like, you know, if you're a good writer, it doesn't necessarily, you know, necessarily need a degree.
And he was one on the technical side. And then James Carey was games editor at the time, and you know, massively enthusiastic, again, a brilliant writer and gave me gave me a couple of chances. I think my second issue is the magazine.
I think Tokka Race Driver 3 came through really late, and it was just before deadline. And and he was like, you know, I'm going to have to freelance this out. It's going to be a nightmare, super hectic.
And I said to him, look, I can, you know, I know these games inside out. I can I can review this for you basically overnight. And I basically pulled an all nighter, wrote like a four page review.
And he loved it. And, you know, I remember sitting there. My desk was sort of over by the production side of things.
But he was he read through the copy and I was sort of sitting there listening out just to hear what was, you know, what he was going to say. And I heard him burst out laughing at one of the lines. I was like, right, OK, I've done a pretty good job.
So, so yeah, like I had the like lead game review in like the second issue of PC Format that I worked on. And I think again, that sort of, you know, taking that chance and establishing myself as a bit of a writer was kind of advantageous. And then I ended up as sort of games editor for a bit in the latter period of PC Format.
So I guess from probably like 2007 to 2008, I think a year and a half-ish I was games editor there before I then moved over to OXM.
So you were there when Crisis came out. I was going to ask like, what were the key PC games of that period that are sort of seeded into your brain as, you know, your PC format era kind of games?
Gosh, it's always a complete blur. Yeah, that's really, yeah, really interesting question. I just feel like the sheer volume of them, I think particularly when I was games editor and I was kind of in charge of filling the magazine with sort of, you know, as many games as possible.
We were trying to cover, we had this sort of maximalist cover everything approach, which I just don't think is feasible these days with the amount of games that come out. But I'll tell you, the demo I remember impressing me the most was actually Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. I remember I was sitting in a cinema in London and they were running, I think they said they were running on Xbox 360 hardware and I just could not believe the level of detail running at 60 frames per second.
And that was a big deal at the time.
Two years after COD 2, which is such a simpler looking game by comparison.
Yeah, it's absolutely wild. And I think, you know, I don't want to be like, I was there and I predicted that it was going to be a success, but I was genuinely blown away. I don't think I could have imagined how big Call of Duty would become, but I do remember that first sort of reveal.
And I'm pretty sure, yeah, Crysis was reviewed. In fact, I think I remember reviewing Crysis Warhead as well. So, but that was, yeah, that was interesting.
Obviously, there was a lot to talk about on a sort of tech-focused PC magazine, tech and games-focused PC magazine when Crysis came out. But the game we used to play in the office was Quake 4, weirdly. Even though Quake 4 is not a great game and not a patch on Quake 3, it was, it had just released, literally, it was the game I did a sort of trial review for when I applied for the internship.
My mum was like, I was going to review some old game. My mum was like, you've got to have a new game. I will buy you a new game so you can review it.
Yeah, and it was a copy of Quake 4. And we used to, we used to just every lunchtime and after work because we were all single men in our sort of 20s and 30s, we just used to sit around and play Quake 4. So that was a seminal game of that period as well.
I have a really clear memory of going to the pub at the Boater. Is it the Boater on Portnay Bridge? The Boatman?
Something like that.
The Boater, the Boater, yeah.
The one with the pub garden down by the river. And there being a load of PC Format people who'd just been playing Bioshock. Oh yes.
They were all like wide-eyed talking about this spanner you could level up into a god hammer. I just remember like Al Bickham and Alec Muir talking about this stuff and thinking, holy shit, that's going to be amazing, like.
Yeah, definitely. Al reviewed that one for us and it was a great review. And then about a month later he started working at 2K and we were like, huh, but it turns out the game, history has been kind to the game so it's probably fine.
But I wonder whether it would have fouled his interview process if he had given it a 6 out of 10.
That's funny.
Yeah, so Bioshock was big. Yeah, it's weird, you asked me about the games and I'm like, it's just a massive blur almost. I need to go back and start reading my old PC Format magazines and work out what I was writing about.
Well, it was quite rude of me because I didn't put that question in the plan, so it's all good. That's fine. And it was a long time ago.
So I was curious what your memories of Bath are like though, like just because I always hear about how the city used to be quite different to how it is now. But I was curious about what you remember about the pubs in Bath or just the vibe of being there, like being there at that time. What do you really recall?
I loved living in Bath. I absolutely adored it. But the problem with me living in Bath was that I hadn't lived in London yet.
And I knew at some point during my 20s, I wanted to live in London. So that was always kind of on the horizon. But the thing about Bath was I lived like five minutes' walk from work.
So I used to roll out of bed at about 25 past 9, and have a quick shower and show up to work about 15 minutes late. And that was just glorious. And then after work, we just go to the pub basically and talk about...
I was seeing the pub talking about video games. And you've got to remember that at the time, not a lot of people played video games or at least gave them monkeys about them in the level of detail that I did. So at uni, I'd occasionally be able to persuade someone to talk about a video game and or recommend something to someone.
And I remember that first day where I went for my sort of like interview and kind of hung out in the office and did some trial bits of work and stuff. And after, they were like, oh, we're going to the pub. Do you want to come and hang out?
And I think we went to the Pig and Fiddle. And it just being there and sitting with people who talked knowledgably about video games. And we just sat there in the pub for the entire evening and talked about, again, my sort of specialist subject.
And it was, yeah, it was a revelation. And so I loved that. It sounds dreadful, but really, all we really did was play Quake and go to the pub.
And it was brilliant. And as someone in their very early 20s, who looked up to a lot of these writers and had basically landed their dream job, it was just heaven. But I sort of stayed there for three years.
And then I was sort of starting to look towards London. And at the time, I was in a relationship with someone who lived in London. So I was looking to move that way anyway.
And then the job at OXM came up. But I didn't leave Bath because I didn't like it. I loved that kind of everything was accessible.
Everything was a five minute walk away. Loads of friends there. You know, really, really fun sort of atmosphere.
But I suppose towards the end, it did start to feel a little bit sort of small. You know, I was kind of ready to strike out. I think if it had been the other way round, you know, and if I'd done London and exhausted London, if such a thing is possible, then maybe, you know, maybe it would have been a different vibe.
But yeah, I loved Bath, you know, it just felt like it's not somewhere I ever imagined I would necessarily live. I don't think I even, you know, until I applied for the job at Future, I don't think I'd ever really interrogated where Bath was. But when I went there, I sort of fell in love with it.
And at one point, I was living with a bunch of other sort of future people in a big house.
Did you live in that big future house just across the river?
Yes, just across the river, up the hill. Yeah, yeah, we held several big house parties up there. And yeah, I mean, you'll remember exactly how close it was to Key House.
Yeah, yeah, that was great. I've got a picture of a house party I went to there. It must have been when you were living there, because I'd have no other reason to go.
Yeah.
And Kim Richards was dressed as Faith from Mirror's Edge and was kicking me in the head.
Yes. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah.
Yeah, we did have a couple of costume parties, one of which I had to... This is not at all related to video games, but well, actually, I can make it slightly related to video games. But I locked my door because just during a house party, I didn't want people wandering into my room and stuff.
But then I accidentally locked the key in there. And so I had to climb through an upper window, like a thin upper window at the top of a sort of external window into my room and like handstand on the windowsill and then roll onto the bed. And somehow, this is after several drinks, and I somehow managed to do this without breaking my neck.
And I managed to get the door open. And as I opened the door, then editor of PC Gamer, Ross Atherton, was standing there and shook my hand. Because it was such an unlikely thing to have done.
So, yeah, there you go. Slightly tangentially related to Vinny. No, I love it.
That's good stuff.
But it was a great sort of great group there, very sort of like, like I said, we sort of felt like the kind of new generation, there was this sort of influx of younger people around the same time you guys were joining the industry as well. And it really felt like when we wandered in, we were the sort of the young blood. And we had a really, really good time.
That's awesome. So you mentioned that you were looking to live in London at a certain point. You were in a relationship at the time.
How did you end up on OXM off the back of that?
So I knew John T from playing Quake 4. So he was working on the... This is John Hicks, who has been a guest of this podcast.
But I knew John T and I'd written some freelance. I mean, we all freelanced for all sorts of magazines. So it's worth saying that I did eventually end up writing for Games Master Magazine, which was kind of cool.
And also PC Gamer and various other places like that. But I'd written some bits for Windows Magazine, Windows XP at the time. And so he kind of knew what I could do and knew I was a decent writer and all that.
And so when the job came up for reviews editor at OXM, I was like, well, I should have a pretty decent shot of this. And so I applied for the job. And I didn't get it, actually.
Someone else got it, who will remain nameless. Someone else got the job. And I was like, oh, okay.
I thought I was a bit of a shoe in there, you know. Not that I didn't try in the interview, but I don't think I've ever been particularly good in interviews, weirdly. I think I just get in my own head about it.
So maybe the interview wasn't great or whatever. But then that person decided not to take the job. And so Johnty ended up, when he came back to Bath at one point, he was like, well, the other person doesn't want the job.
Will you take it? And I said, yes, because I'm not a prideful person. I wasn't prepared to look a gift horse in the mouth.
So I took the job. And in the end, I think Johnty will confess that probably in the end, I was the right person because one of the things we immediately did when I joined was started doing video stuff. And so we used to publish videos on the Xbox dashboard and video became a really key component of my job.
And I made it that because I could kind of see that this was important and likely to become an important medium in the future. So I sort of worked doubly hard in that period to try and make sure that we were producing not only was I reviews editor for this magazine, but we were producing weekly videos to go up on the dashboard. I honestly think that was one of the things that sort of maintained us as the biggest UK games magazine was that we had this constant presence on people's consoles.
They were kind of just aware of OXM as a thing. So there was definitely a period where OPM's readership dropped a bit and things like that. And I think other mags like PC Gamer were dropping a bit.
And OXM was staying strong at... I think these were not enormous numbers, but I think we were selling about 60k a month, which is pretty good at the time, to be honest. It's definitely far after the kind of...
This is 2007? Yeah, no, early 2008 I joined OXM. So eight years or so after that period where games magazines were regularly selling like 120,000 copies a month or whatever.
But I definitely think the video thing was really important. And also the publishers loved it. So they loved the idea that they were going to get a story in OXM, but also like a video on the Xbox dashboard.
And we really managed to parlay that into some pretty good trips. And when that relationship ended, John T very kindly said, all right, you can just go on all the press trips. Because I think you could tell I didn't really want to be in the flat that I was still sharing with my ex and that kind of thing.
So I ended up on this sort of around 2009 on this sort of mad round the world tour making videos and writing articles and all sorts. And so it was a great opportunity to get around, see the world, get into all sorts of interesting scrapes and came out someone with some video experience.
When you were doing the dashboard stuff for OXM, how closely were you working with Xbox on that? And were you getting guidance as a presenter? Because obviously, I ended up doing the Xbox YouTube channel with Microsoft.
And we had some stuff on the dashboard and it was just like navigating so many guidelines and restrictions. But I felt like what you were doing had the feel of independent editorial. Like how was that navigating that experience?
Yeah, I think it was a little bit like the Wild West. Obviously, so Andy, who is my colleague outside Xbox, was working for Xbox at the time. And he was one of the people in charge of that video content.
And to hear him tell it, there really wasn't a lot of oversight because it was this sort of forgotten element. And they'd hired people for it and then they just let it run. And it wasn't until sort of later on that they started employing people whose job was to go, what is this weird stuff you're putting up there?
But before then, I think there's a great degree of creative freedom. And there's a little bit of chatting with Andy about whether it was OK to do stuff and let him know what we had planned. But really, yeah, there was a lot of freedom.
In terms of guidance as a presenter, I mean, I was a dreadful presenter back in those days. Like, if I went back and looked at those videos, I would cringe myself inside out. Because, yeah, it was really my first experience on camera.
And I think I was a decent interviewer. Like, I had a knack for getting interesting information out of people and not sort of waffling too much in the question, which I think is really key on video. Like, when you're a print journalist, you can, you know, you can caveat and hedge and do all this stuff when you're asking the question to make yourself not to...
Chip away until you find a question somewhere in there.
Exactly. Whereas with video, you know, I got quite good at just, you know, working out what to say and saying it in as brief a manner as possible. So that stuff was fine.
But really, you know, it wasn't... The content we were making was really just what we had time to make. And, you know, it was a job in itself being the reviews editor and trying to organize all the review code and get the reviews commissioned out and write a ton of stuff myself.
So really, these videos were sort of... That was like my Monday was basically trying to chuck this stuff together. And so quite often it was just interviews, whereas, you know, the stuff Andy was producing over on Inside Xbox.
Internally, they had, you know, some amazing stuff they put together. But they, you know, they were not also trying to run a magazine. So, yeah, it was...
I don't think the content was particularly stellar. It's not something that I would really want to go back and revisit, which is good, because it's all disappeared now. But even looking back at early days of outside Xbox, you know, I'm pretty embarrassed by how I look and sound on camera back then.
So I think I did a lot of my learning as a presenter on outside Xbox. And so, you know, we're not so proud that we've deleted all the old videos where it's embarrassing. So if you really want to go and find out how wooden and rubbish I was at the start, you can go back and find that out.
But I definitely think, yeah, over the now nearly 13 years of outside Xbox, that's where I've really sort of flourished as a presenter.
Yeah, it was an amazing exposure, like that dashboard and the way that content was delivered. It really did feel like the first thing you saw when you turned on the console and it made it feel quite alive. And yeah, there was a magazine mentioned right there, a very powerful thing.
I was curious if, as someone who had a PC background, you found Xbox particularly interesting or exciting at that time. Because I think first half of the 360 generation might be my favorite period of Xbox. Xbox has history more generally, but I was curious what you made of it coming into it from that PC background.
I think it really felt like that console was an important generational leap, not so much in terms of graphics, but just in terms of scope. I know that Morrowind was on the original Xbox, but really it feels like I've played it. It feels like an extremely compromised experience.
But you've got to bear in mind that in 2006, Oblivion came out on the Xbox 360. The idea that you could fit a game of that scale and that fidelity, that world on a console, it just felt like a totally different experience from the previous generation, I think. Even the PS2 had some amazing games.
But I really felt like it was a step forward with 360. And I think Microsoft brought with it a bit more of a PC sensibility. I think Xbox Live, while I was initially skeptical of the fact that you had to pay for it, it was such a brilliant experience on the 360 in terms of convenience, voice chat, all that kind of stuff.
And Xbox Live Arcade, I thought, was a really inspired idea, getting these brilliant indie games or old arcade games, again, a bit of my specialist subjects there. But yeah, I just think that it all came together really brilliantly for the 360. It was deservedly successful.
And I was lucky to be working on an Xbox magazine at the time rather than a PlayStation magazine because the PS3 was struggling. It was overly expensive, difficult to code for. A lot of the time, the 360 version was the technically superior version of the game.
So there's a bit of fortune involved in all this stuff, really.
Hmm, yeah. So you did mention that you became the, you did your Around the World Tour in 2009. Yes.
Just doing lots of trips in a row. I was curious which trips you ended up doing off the back of this, because it was a good time for this sort of thing. Oh, yeah.
I was dividing them up with a team of four people, but even I got to go on a lot of cool trips. So I was curious what the highlights were for you from that period on OXM.
I mean, the absolute highlight was for Colin McRae Dirt 2, which was a brilliant, brilliant game. But it was a game that was made in conjunction with Ken Block. And as part of that relationship with Ken Block, I was invited out to the X Games to kind of interview him.
And they had rally racing at the X Games. And what Ken Block did was he booked out the entirety of the Standard Downtown, which is one of my favorite hotels. Sadly, no longer the Standard, it's been bought by someone else, but it has a rooftop bar in Downtown LA.
And you stand on the top of this bar and you have a drink and there's all these skyscrapers around you. And it just feels very sort of glamorous and cool. And he booked out this entire hotel for the entire week.
And there were parties every night. And then we would go to the X Games during the day and play the game. And that was like, felt sort of fairly, fairly kind of glamorous stuff.
Similarly, the Black Ops reveal event was another big sort of event in LA. And then a lot of the trips, I seem to spend most of my time in Vancouver. I felt like I was in Vancouver every other week.
It felt like, or Montreal, you know, Ubisoft Montreal. I was one of the first people outside of Ubisoft to finish Assassin's Creed 2. And obviously, I don't know if you recall, like the first Assassin's Creed, I think a lot of people admired what it was going for, but didn't feel like it was the kind of finished article.
So I went over to do this exclusive review of Assassin's Creed 2 with Rachel Webber, formerly of OPM and now at IGN. And I remember that first day we sort of sat there, just in this room in Ubisoft Montreal, playing the game for sort of eight hours, which was typically how these things went. You just sort of sat there in a hermetically sealed room, playing this game for hours.
And I remember we got back to the hotel and we were standing in the lift and the PR was there. And we were making a nice friendly small talk and not trying to keep our cards close to our chests, but the PR got off at his level of the hotel and we carried on up to the floor that both our rooms were on. And I remember both of us turning to each other, standing in the lift, me and Rachel, and we were both like, it's really good, isn't it?
It's really, really good. And I don't think either of us had expected it to be quite as good as it was. And you know, Sassacruy too was brilliant because they brought the story in, they brought the character in, they had more to do in the world.
Each of the assassinations felt more tailored and more like an individual mission. And you know, the cities, I think it was Florence and Venice, wasn't it? Both of them looked absolutely stunning.
So yeah, that was a real moment where we were sort of, no one else knew, you know, and that was, it was a really cool feeling part of that like exclusive club. You're like, yeah, you know, you're one of the first people who's played this game outside of the company and you know before anyone else, and you're the one who gets the exciting job of relaying that information to people. And then I loved E3s as well.
That was me with Red Steel. Yes, of course.
Breathlessly reported.
It only works if everyone else goes on to love the game too.
Yeah, it's true. I never felt too bad about, I don't even see it as getting it wrong. It's just, you know, sometimes stuff, you know, clicks with you and it doesn't click with other people.
And that's fine, you know. You don't want to be in one of those situations. I'd much rather be the person who has the first opinion and whether people agree with it or not than, you know, that sort of thing where everyone's reviewing the game and sort of looking over their shoulder and wondering what the consensus is and worrying about whether they're going to be deviating from that.
It's wild to me that, like, we've ended up in a situation, it's still the case today, where there is, like, groupthink around video game scores. It's like, if you look at film criticism, like, a Rotten Tomatoes page will be, like, acres and acres of reviews, and loads of them will disagree with each other, you know? And if you had a spread of scores, you'd have everything from probably 2 out of 10 to 10 out of 10.
And I love that diversity of opinion. But for some reason, I don't know if it's because video games have a technical aspect, and it's, you know, it's very rare that you go to a film and there's like a boom in shot and the camera is pointing the wrong way when a conversation is happening. But I guess that stuff can happen in video games, which I might assume would draw things sort of closer to, you know, draw the spread closer.
But ultimately, like, you know, if you love Red Steel, I feel like there should be 10 out of 10 reviews of Red Steel and there should be 3 out of 10 reviews of Red Steel. And there should be a spread in between as well. But we just don't seem to have gotten to that.
You know, we hear all these conversations about how games are art. And we've been talking about that for the last 30 years. But like, they're not reviewed like art.
They're reviewed like a consumer product, which is weird to me.
Preach. I was curious just to kind of press you further on trips, because we always get good stories out of guests when we sort of like pursue this line of questioning, Mike. I was curious what kind of big interviews you got at the time.
You mentioned Ken Block there. But which kind of big game developers did you end up speaking to? Were there any other kind of trips that you would highlight as sort of like significant in your time on OXM?
Yeah. I really enjoyed chatting to people. I got to go out to...
I mean, this is pre-OXM actually, when I was on Format, I got to go out to visit Valve and play The Orange Box ahead of time for review. That was super exciting, playing Portal for the first time, and Episode 2, and Team Fortress 2. I always enjoyed chatting to Chet Falizek.
Left 4 Dead was big when we were on OXM. That was our lunchtime game. We played a lot of Left 4 Dead.
Chatting to guys like Todd Howard, people like that around the time Fallout 3 was coming out. I remember playing Fallout 3 at Gamescom. I'd seen the concept art of Rivet City, which was the big aircraft carrier, sort of city built inside an aircraft carrier in Fallout 3.
And at Gamescom, Bethesda foolishly said, well, you can just, we're going to start you coming out of the vault and you can just play for an hour, do whatever you want and then write about it. And I decided I was going to go straight to Rivet City because I wanted to see what it looked like. And I went in, wandered in and immediately met a character called Dr. Lee, who reveals quite a lot of plot.
You're supposed to meet her after doing a ton of other missions. And I wandered over to her and she's like, oh, you look just like your father. And I'm like, what?
And I remember after I came out of the session, I went over to Pete Hines and said, so I met Dr. Lee and he was like, please don't write about that. So yeah, that was kind of fun. But yeah, interviews wise, I mean, I did all sorts of wild stuff.
Like it's not really an interview, but like I, so when DJ Hero is out, we did this thing, again, because of the video connection, we did a project where we were going to do videos on the dashboard and I would learn how to DJ, talk by the DJ Hero DJs. And I would perform at the launch party. And so I learned how to DJ.
I sort of did basically all I could do to get through that sort of 15-20 minute set at the launch party. But I did it, it went reasonably well. And I came off stage and DJ Shadow was going on stage, one of the most famous DJs of all time.
And I had met him previously and I was saying I was nervous about it. I came off stage and said, it turned out it went okay. And he was like, yep, sounded good to me.
And I was like, well, I'll be dining out on that for a very, very long time.
Did you DJ at the Golden Joysticks?
I did DJ at the Golden Joysticks. Yeah, I remember that. I did basically exactly the same set because I was very limited in my abilities.
But yeah, that was all part of that thing. I got to drive cars, I got to go to the Grand Prix. It was very much, I got to indulge my love of motorsport in a way that I wouldn't have been able to had I chosen the other career path, having won that motorsport journalism competition.
And gone on to write about cars, you know. I think it might have ruined my love for motorsport if I had to be sitting there reporting on them. Whereas video games, even the bad ones, are kind of designed to be fun, and you can probably find some fun in them.
So yeah, I'm kind of glad I chose that path.
PRs must have absolutely loved having someone who really liked racing games on a magazine like I said.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
It's a genre where often you don't have a fan on the mag. I wouldn't say it's a niche, but one person writes all the racing reviews for the whole company.
You and Phil Ivaniuk, Mike, and no one else, basically. That's it.
Yeah, Phil Ivaniuk joined PC Format after I left Future, and he basically took up the mantle. He became the car guy.
What's the snazziest thing you got to drive at a press event?
My favorite thing, I think the first ever Ferrari I drove was a Ferrari F355, which is obviously a very famous Sega Arcade Racing game as well, F355 Challenge. So being able to drive one of those at Silverstone while I was on PC Format, actually, was pretty exciting. But I drove all sorts like rally cars and bits and bobs.
I did some ice rallying for Dirt 3 on a frozen lake in Sweden. That was pretty cool. And I did banger racing for Dirt Showdown at Wimbledon Dog Track, where I took my life in my hands, driving an absolute, just absolute shed of a car with a bunch of other people.
There was no sense of health and safety at this event. They were just like, they got a bunch of local banger racers to bring their borderline wrecked cars to Wimbledon Dog Track. And they told us all to drive around in a circle and crash into each other, which we duly did.
Oh my god.
John T rammed me into a tire that was on the ground, and I popped the car up onto two wheels. So that was, yeah. If I'd rolled it, I don't know what would have happened, but yeah, it was very, very sketchy.
So yeah, I don't know, it was all good fun, really. It just, I thought the golden era of press trips and things was over when I arrived, but we got to do some pretty cool stuff.
Just thinking how much that would stress me out as a PR, if I just saw a journalist nearly die in some kind of crash, that would be quite stressful, I think.
Yes.
Yeah. I can't remember which Forza it was when I was on Xbox On, but we did a racetrack day driving supercars. I apologize, I know fuck all about these things.
You might have even been there. I remember they had all these driving experiences, but they also had demo stations set up to play whatever, like Motorsport 7. They had a thing that whoever got the fastest time in the game could drive the best car at the track that no one else was allowed to drive.
I'm pretty sure Benny Central, who was the host of Xbox On, won it because he's good at games. He can't drive, he hasn't got a driving license. So he just had to sit in this car and get driven around the track, while all these other people who could drive and desperately wanted to do it just gave him the evils.
Oh no, oh no. I did get to drive the reasonably priced car of the time around the Top Gear test track for a Forza thing. Oh wow.
That was pretty cool. Yeah, it was silly at the time really. Even the stuff that wasn't particularly notable was still brilliant.
I loved going to Vancouver. I did a triathlon in 2011 and I used to go out on the bike because it was 10 km around Stanley Park in Vancouver, which is a beautiful park. And so the bike section of a triathlon is 40 km.
So I do like four laps on a bike around there. That's sort of practice for my triathlon. And Vancouver is a lovely city.
It's really crisp air coming down from the mountains. It feels very clean. It's sort of got North American vibes.
And then you go to Montreal and it's got more of the kind of French influence and stuff like that.
You are so different to me and Samuel.
Big travel man vibes from the way you enjoy this trip.
A huge part where I can practice for my triathlon. Where we're like, where did you get a nasty burger in that city?
I mean, I definitely ate my fair share of nasty burgers as well. Yes, go on.
I did want to ask you a bit about your memories of the old Future London office, Mike, because it's not a space I'm that familiar with. I think I was there at the very end of it. And the vibes were quite strange.
Yes.
But what do you remember about working there?
It was a really good team. It was me and John T, obviously, and it was like Ben Talbot and Gillan McAllister were there when I first joined. But actually, they both left.
And for a while, it was a very, very small team. So we brought Log into John Blythe, who's a brilliant writer, absolutely fantastic human being as well. And he was sort of freelancing and basically freelancing in the office.
And for a while, it was really, we were running the magazine with three editorial staff. It was me, John T and Log on a freelance retainer in the office. So that was kind of crazy.
And I still think we produced really, really good stuff. And then Matt Lees joined of Shut Up and Sit Down fame now. And he was a brilliant writer, really energetic, full of ideas.
And we had some great work experience people as well. So having done the sort of internship thing and joined PC Format and been the young blood, we then had people like Alice Bell who worked for Rock Paper Shotgun for a long time and Joe Scribbles who's worked for all sorts of places, including O&M and IGN. They were both like workies that we brought on during times like E3 when it was really busy and we needed extra hands at the tiller, or not the tiller, at the pump probably.
I probably was supposed to have my hand on the tiller because John T always used to go to E3 and quite often I would be left back to make the magazine.
Thank you for getting your boating metaphor straight.
I want to be accurate. So yeah, we had some brilliant writers and stuff. I'm really proud of what we produced on OXM.
I think it was the biggest games magazine in the UK at the time. It was a licensed Microsoft approved magazine, but we had a degree of editorial freedom. We didn't have to submit pages for approval to Microsoft or anything like that.
They trusted us to get on with it, which I know wasn't the case on a lot of those licensed magazines. We produced some really fun stuff and all the while we were doing these videos that were directing people towards it as well. So it felt like a really good spot to be in.
But obviously, as I got to mid 2012, I could see that the writing was on the wall in terms of magazines and YouTube was beginning to become this sort of... It was unavoidably... There was this crossover where you would be talking to PR and they would be the experienced management person and they'd be talking to you about a magazine cover, for example, and they'd be spending a lot of time and energy talking to you about a magazine cover for a magazine that will sell 55,000 copies.
Meanwhile, the young guy who's like the social media manager, young guy or girl, is probably looking after YouTubers who have a million subscribers and are doing... Which at the time was huge, and are doing videos that are doing double or triple the readership of the magazines. And that disconnect was just so obvious.
And it felt so strange to be at that tipping point where the old media was given like a lot of respect, but actually the readership was, in terms of influence, was tiny compared to what some of these four or five big YouTubers could pull. So yeah, at that point, it was kind of obvious that the video was where it was at. And unfortunately, I'd been making videos for three years by that point.
And I thought I was all right at it. It turns out I wasn't and had a lot of learning to do. But at the very least, I had the misplaced confidence to set up with Andy and Jane and start a YouTube channel.
Yeah, nice. So what were the early days of outside Xbox like? Did it feel daunting leaving future at all to go and make that?
Yeah, it was a big leap. I kind of, while I say that it was obvious to me that the writing was on the wall, I was still, it was a job I was enjoying. I was working with a team that I really liked.
I felt comfortable. And, you know, and so it was a risky thing to do. And, you know, we, our agreement with Gamer Network to set up outside Xbox was that we tried for a year, right?
That we, they'd sort of bankroll it for a year and kind of, they'd pay us enough money that we could quit our jobs and, you know, and have a proper go at this. But none of us really knew if it was gonna be successful. And I think, you know, YouTube was kind of unpredictable.
None of us had really worked on YouTube previously. We'd made videos and we thought we'd made good videos, but we didn't have a ton of experience on YouTube as a platform. And also, to a degree, like I said, I half wondered if we'd missed the boat, you know, like there were already YouTubers with a million subscribers and that seemed enormous.
And, you know, like, how could we possibly compete with that? As it turns out, and with the benefit of hindsight, it's clear that YouTube was a much smaller place back then and it was much less saturated. It was much easier to make your way on it.
But we did our first few months and I think within a few months, we had 100,000 subscribers, maybe. Or maybe it was a year. I can't remember the specifics of the sort of timeline, but it became obvious by that end of that first year that this was a going concern.
And actually, weirdly, outside Xbox was originally planned to be sort of a video-focused website. And we were only really putting stuff on YouTube because it was cheaper than paying hosting costs for video. But actually, it very quickly became clear that YouTube, as an ecosystem, was a much easier way of finding people than trying to compete for Google SEO.
I always wondered why you had that site.
Yeah, it existed for a while. For every video, we would have the YouTube embed, but we would also write a little blurb and description for the website. And we were making videos one video a day, five days a week at that point, which was, I don't really understand where we had the time and energy for it.
But yeah, it became very quickly clear, A, that the business was viable, right? Like we could keep doing this and sustain ourselves. And B, that YouTube was absolutely the thing to focus on, and we should forget about the website and just go all in on YouTube.
And not too long after that, a few years after that, we hit a million subscribers and we're now at 2.6 or something like that.
Amazing.
With Outside Xtra on a million. And OX Venture growing as well. Hopefully that will hit 100,000 at some point fairly soon.
And yeah, so it was the right leap at the right time, but it felt daunting and it was like I had like heart to hearts with my with my now wife about whether I should do it and she was very supportive. So, yeah, we had a crack at it and haven't really looked back since. And like I said, it's nearly 13 years now, so it's absolutely the longest job I've had in video games by a by a fair whack.
And it makes the joining PC format thing seem like a long time ago.
Yeah, I bet. One thing I did want to ask about about how you approach outside Xboxes. I know that you had an affinity for Games Master, the TV show growing up.
Yes.
I was curious what role that and also your history in writing for games mags and forms the kind of content that you would make on outside Xbox and have continued to make in those 13 years.
Yeah, absolutely. I think there's two fairly sort of clear sort of approaches that come together. Obviously, in terms of Games Master, the TV show, it was funny.
It didn't need to be funny. I probably would have watched it even if it wasn't funny. I mean, I watched Bad Influence and that was not a show designed to be funny.
It was a show designed to be informative. But I felt like Games Master had that sort of anarchic. It was written by people who were trying to be, they were setting out to be funny first and foremost.
And if you learn something about video games after the fact, then that was a happy accident almost. And I think that's how I feel about how we write our list videos on outside Xbox. It's like the goal, the number one goal is to make people laugh or smile.
And we're not there to explain video games to people. We're there to unearth interesting bits of trivia. But we're not there to, you know, I don't think I would consider our lists informative first and foremost.
They're just a hook for, you know, for, they're interesting nuggets of information, but they're a hook for making jokes and pulling faces and things like that. And then in terms of magazines, I think, you know, we are, we certainly, at the time we started, and things have changed a lot on YouTube since we started, but the time we started YouTube was a lot of people in bedrooms playing video games, right? And so I think very early on we brought a kind of editorial sensibility to YouTube that was quite rare at the time.
And I, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to pretend we're the people who introduced like gaming listicles to YouTube, but like there weren't a lot of people making gaming listicles when we started making gaming listicles. And that really was the stuff that, that kind of accelerated outside Xbox to its success, was that sort of slightly editorial approach of like gathering that sort of stuff and writing a script that was funny rather than just sort of mumbling into a microphone about video games and talking off the top of your head about it. So I think that editorial approach like served as well.
And I will say the reason, the reason our outside Xbox videos are seven entries long is an old magazine thing, right? It's that you never put like a round number on the thing because it makes it feel like you've just kind of, you know, you've made up the numbers somehow. Do you know what I mean?
So the old magazine wisdom was like, well, you make it seven things or you make it eight things or nine things because it feels like those are the nine most important things that you need to know. And, you know, we're not adding another number just to make it ten or arbitrarily reducing it down to five. And so, yeah, if you want a sort of clear stark way that sort of magazine thinking influenced outside Xbox, that, you know, the number seven and it's long standing connection to outside Xbox is old magazine wisdom, probably from John T.
As you're writing late into the night, it hits midnight and you're desperately trying to squeeze out that seventh entry. Do you ever think, why the fuck didn't we just do six? Six is still a colorful number, why didn't we do six?
There have been odd occasions where we have had to make it six for, you know, for some reason or other. You know, like we couldn't get the capture or, you know, there's some problem or issue or, you know, we wrote, we researched something, but it turned out the research was slightly wrong and it was impossible to replicate and things like that. So there have been occasions where it's been six, but it's always felt like a little death.
Yeah. How have you not gone mad doing these lists over the years? Because I've done stretches of list writing for different channels and-
Including us, you've written for us before.
I've written a couple for you and they were, I found them hard.
They're tough. Yeah, they are tough.
Because you guys, because you put yourself on camera in the chair and you're there, and it feels like, I don't know, it feels like the jokes have to work better when you can see someone. You can hide behind VO a little bit.
I feel like the key to that stuff is commitment, right? I also feel that the thing you should reassure yourself with is that, like, I find that if you perform, you can make up, like, a weakish joke with a good performance, right? And you can, and if the joke's really good, it doesn't even matter if the performance, do you know what I mean?
If the performance isn't that great, if the joke's brilliant, it will land anyway. So I think you just have to kind of commit to stuff. But everything you wrote for us was brilliant, and I thoroughly enjoyed performing your jokes.
They were great, so don't be hard on yourself. And actually, I remember sending you a bunch of comments from people who watched that video, that first video you scripted for us, and they were all very lovely comments. So, yeah, but I don't need to write this.
But the nice thing is you read the comments and it's all like, this is classic Andy or this is classic Luke. And you're like, actually, it's classic Castle. But anyway.
Yeah, but I genuinely think that I've written mediocre jokes. But I'm confident enough that I can elevate them with a bit of mugging to camera and make them funnier than perhaps they deserve to be. So you can get away with a little more, I find, on camera.
But it's tough. I mean, I'm not going to lie. We've been doing this for a very, very long time.
And we've gotten better at it. But it's always difficult to stare at that blank page and think, well, we've got to get seven entries out. And there's got to be at least two jokes or funny turns of phrase in each one.
And sometimes the funny just doesn't arrive for you. So yeah, it can be difficult. But I think we've made hundreds of these videos now.
It's sort of wild when you look back at the body of work, if you want to give it such a high-fleecing phrase, high-fleecing term.
They start so sort of broad in topics. Like you can get away with like seven massive open worlds. And now you're into such obscure stuff.
It's not that you've painted yourself into a corner, but you've done every mainstream topic there is. Yeah, we've covered that. It's into stuff where you're like, were there even seven of those things?
No, not at all. I mean, yeah. I'm full of admiration for it.
It's a tough gig.
I sometimes arrive at an ideas meeting and think, are all the ideas gone? Have we done them all? But we always seem to come up with something funny and interesting and weird.
I kind of like the specificity of the... You know, the broad stuff is all well and good, but there's a hundred people who can make the seven biggest open worlds. I love all the...
I love the really weird stuff. Like, we've done some videos about, like, you know, like, NPCs whose lives were ruined by the hero of the game. And it's like going back, going in and, like, dissecting exactly what this person's interactions with the hero are and how badly it would affect them afterwards.
And just that stuff that requires a little more research, a little more in-depth thinking is so satisfying to pull off.
I like the things where it's like the weapon you're to work really hard for or that turns out to be rubbish.
Yes.
Or that kind of twit. There's so many parts to it that each entry has to satisfy. You're like, man, you know, that's why I'm like, where does this stuff come from?
Because my brain is shot these days.
But again, it's like, you know, and this goes back to reading Games Master and stuff. It's like, I'm fortunate enough that, like, the majority of the existence of video games has occurred within my lifetime. And if I haven't played it, I've probably read about it somewhere, you know, and seen screenshots and watched a video and stuff.
So, you know, when you multiply that by three, because, you know, like Andy and Jane, obviously also, you know, consume games media very, very sort of omnivorous in terms of their interests as well with video games. Like, normally, if you can come up with an interesting title, you'll get, you know, you'll be like, oh, I know a couple of these ones and someone else will pitch in. And by that point, you've got most of your seven entries.
And then you go off and do a bit of research and you've and you get the other three. So, you know, we're very fortunate that we're very knowledgeable about video games. And all the kind of mugging to camera kind of maybe belies the fact that we do know our subject matter inside out.
And for me, I credit a lot of that with reading a lot of games magazines as a kid.
Well, I'm going to be obsessed now with looking out for the six things kind of videos. Now that I've heard this behind the scenes information. Six weirdest achievements nobody got by accident from nine months ago.
That's I can totally see how the seventh might allude you for that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's we do make a rod for our own back in terms of capturing stuff. So this is, you know, at the moment we're doing, I mean, this is this video will probably have gone out, hopefully have gone out by the time this podcast arrives. But we're going to do a video about hidden areas in games that you were never meant to see.
Right, so these are all like busted, you know, bits of development architecture and stuff left in games that they forgot to delete, right? But it's an absolute nightmare to get the capture for because I'm there, like, today, I was playing the Japanese PSP version of an old Kingdom Hearts game and using built-in cheat tables to warp to an old bit of Jungle Book level that was left in only the Japanese version of the game. And it's like, what am I doing?
The weirdest one I've done is I... So there was a story, I don't know if you remember this story, it's a Fallout-related story, but there was a thing about the DLC for Fallout, there was a bit where you ride in a train, and this story was broken by PC Gamer, and the train is a hat, right, that you wear or something like that. And so PC Gamer had this shot in the magazine of a guy wearing a hat, but it was from the development kit, right?
So it's a static shot of a player model with a train hat on. And I'm like, well, that's all well and good, but like, and I could probably put the image in the video and credit PC Gamer, and I'm sure they'd be lovely about it. But I just thought in video, you need to see the bloody thing working, don't you?
So I, in a very modest way, taught myself to mod Fallout 3 and made a mod where, and this is the only way I can get it to work. I made a mod where when you ride the train, it's supposed to delete the hat from you after you finished the train ride. And I made a mod where it didn't delete the hat.
And so I had probably the only footage on the planet of someone running around in Fallout, in the wasteland, wearing a train hat. And I'm very proud of that. And that is the length, the lengths I've gone to get the right footage for these things.
I taught myself to mod Fallout a little bit.
Yeah, hearing that, you are better than playing a PSP version of a Kingdom Hearts game to find us. You are better than them.
I should be trying harder. Yeah, well, I don't know. It's a weird part of the job, isn't it?
Because I think people assume we have a bigger team and teams like taking care of all this stuff and looking after the sort of capture and things. But actually, it's us, right? Like, we write the script and then, and quite often, the ideal is that you get the capture first and then you write to the capture that you've got.
But the way it often works is we need to film it in the studio this week. So we've got to write the script first and then you worry about getting the capture afterwards. And it can be really tricky.
But yeah, I just spend a lot of my time sort of trying to break games to get weird and interesting footage.
Did you do the classic GoldenEye, Damn, Island, Mike, did that end of the list feature?
I think I have done it once, yeah, on an emulator. Emulators are brilliant, sort of thing, because they're so much easier to break. And obviously, you have that entire generation of video games that I read about as a kid is all now emulatable and can be run on PC and captured via that and stuff like that.
But yeah, I'm pretty sure I've done the GoldenEye stuff, done all sorts of weird GoldenEye stuff. N64 emulation is a pain. It never quite looks right.
I don't know what it is about that system. And it's now nearly 30 years old, I guess, and people still can't emulate it properly, which seems like they're not trying hard enough.
Yeah. Okay. Well, good stuff.
I look forward to watching that video. But let's take a quick break then we'll come back and talk about some arcade stuff as a bit of a change of pace.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, Mike has an arcade hobby that we wanted to dip into here. When I met you in Amsterdam last year, I was really intrigued to hear about this thing that you've been investing time and money into.
I don't know anyone else who does this. I guess, what would you call it? Is it arcade collecting?
What is the term for this hobby?
Now, here's the thing I have about the word collector, which is, I feel like collectors are people who put things on shelves, and I'm definitely not that kind of... The reason I like having these arcade machines is I want to play them, basically. I want to be able to play the games.
And I think there's a lot of video game collecting is sort of, well, I need to have every single NES game that was ever made. And I'm like, well, I don't really see the point if you're not playing them. So, yeah, I don't know.
I mean, Arcade Collector is probably the, you know, if the shoe fits, wear it. But yeah, definitely I don't buy them to just kind of own them as kind of physical objects. I do love the games that I've sort of selected to buy.
But yeah, I mean, in terms of how it came about, it was absolutely, it was absolutely me going a bit weird during lockdown. I think we all went a bit weird during lockdown. And I think we all found something that weird to do with our time.
You're on it right now, Mike, to be honest.
Yes, right. There you go. So my theory is, having interrogated this aspect of my personality, usually when I've just paid a lot of money for an arcade machine, when I interrogate this aspect of my personality, what I've surmised is that during lockdown, the world was a terrifying and scary place.
And one of the ways to deal with that is to retreat into nostalgia, which is a sort of going back to a time when the world made sense and everything was lovely and fine and not frightening. And so I became extremely nostalgic for arcades because they don't really exist in the way they used to. They will certainly never be as big as they were at the time.
And as a form of playing games, they're sort of dying out, right? Like you get the odd new driving game, like a Fast and Furious driving game or a new shooting game, maybe. But really, they don't...
Arcades don't really... They're not the money spinners they used to be. And fundamentally, they're never going to look better than the games you can play at home, right?
Whereas back in the 90s, when I was playing Daytona USA, it was far out... Technologically, it was far outstripping anything you could play at home. You'll remember the legendarily bad Saturn port of Daytona USA, right?
It just could not reproduce what was going on in the arcades. And I have such nostalgia for that specific period to the point where, you know, that bowling alley in Wakefield where I grew up, I can still remember like geographically where individual machines were placed within the sort of geography of that bowling alley. So I remember where Turtles was, I remember where the Killer Instinct machine sat, you know, there was a Neo Geo MVS that was down by the lanes, there was the Daytona USA was right next to the Ridge Racer, so you could sort of directly compare them side by side.
And, you know, when the Tekken machine arrived, where that was placed and stuff, it really has a sort of almost like, yeah, geographical memory for me where these arcade machines were. And I fell in love with that. And during the lockdown period, I kind of started, you know, looking into arcade games again, and it coincided with a company called Arcade One Up, who were making these three-quarter scale arcade machines replicas, basically.
Not like, at first, they weren't particularly like close replicas, and they are smaller, and they're flat packs, so they're built like IKEA sort of furniture. So that was my like gateway drug, was these sort of three-quarter scale arcades. And then I just ended up on forums looking at real arcade machines.
And I had always, to be fair, I had always harbored a desire to own a sort of Sega twin racing cabinet. And I loved the idea of having a Day 10 USA, to the point where I think when I was like a... I was in my teens, I remember very optimistically.
I couldn't afford a Day 10 USA cabinet, but what I could afford was like the technical manual. And so I remember buying on eBay like a printout of a Day 10 USA like manual to kind of understand how they worked and how it fit together and how you would maintain it and things like that. So it was sort of like I'll buy the manual and then one day I shall have my twin cabinet.
Anyway, as sort of lockdown finished, like this kind of obsession continued, did not stop when lockdown stopped. And so I've ended up buying a bunch of sort of arcade machines, many of which I don't have space for in my house. So they kind of live in bars and things, but they do mean I can go and play Street Fighter on an old Japanese Astro City candy cab.
Which is just the coolest way to play those games, right? Like original arcade hardware, I'm super nostalgic for the joystick and button layout and things like that, or the old arcade steering wheel and metal pedals and stuff like that. And to a degree, there's a preservation element to it as well.
Like, if I don't buy these games, they might get scrapped. I'm a big motorsport fan. I love the Le Mans 24-hour race.
And Sega made a Le Mans 24-hour arcade racing machine, which is this twin cabinet that I own. But I was convinced that if this didn't sell to me on eBay, it would end up stripped for parts and scattered to the four winds. But so it was this game that was meaningful for me.
Again, geographical, I remember playing it on a ferry between the UK and France when we were going on holiday one year. So I had such fond memories of this game, I didn't want to see it broken down for parts. And so I felt I had to rescue it.
And I did rescue it and replaced the faulty board and repaired these bits and stuff. And it's now in a bar in Brighton entertaining people. And when I eventually have a slightly bigger house, potentially with a garage, I will put the arcade machines in there.
Oh, that's really interesting. So I was curious from doing that, whether it gave you the hunger to track down more cabinets, or is it just too onerous to have too many of these around that might one day have to be stored inside property that you own?
Yes, there is a degree of that. Yes, they take up a lot of space. And I describe myself as over-leveraged in terms of Arcade Machines already.
So I'm at the point now where I don't think I can, much as I would love to, I would love to have a huge collection of Arcade Machines. But as you say, they take up a lot of physical space. They're also fabulously unreliable.
I mean, you can buy something that is working perfectly, and then three weeks later it will just stop working for whatever reason. So they're old technology. Le Monde 24 is a game from 1997.
So that's knocking on for 30 years now. And these boards and components just don't, you know, they don't last essentially. So it's a big commitment as a hobby.
I think I sort of justify it insofar as I kind of, I spend, you know, I'm spending money on a hobby, right? That money might be going to repair broken arcade parts. But I think a lot of people spend money on their hobbies.
So that's how I sort of rationalize it. But they're tricky, yeah. They take up a lot of space.
They break down constantly. And if you don't have an enormous mansion, which I don't, you're not going to be able to keep them all in your house. So you either get a storage unit and pay a princely sum every month to not play them, or you put them in a bar, which is what I've done with a bunch of my machines, and let other people play them, and maybe make a bit of money, you know.
Like people pop pound coins into my Street Fighter machine, and every few months I chat to the owner of the bar, and we split the earnings. So, and hopefully that money just about covers the maintenance.
Yeah, yeah. I did want to ask a bit about the maintenance. So how hard is it to secure parts for these machines?
You mentioned replacing the motherboard, for example. What does that process look like and how costly does it end up being?
It's pretty expensive because as these things get more rare, they get more expensive and also they might not be in the same country as you use. So I have sourced arcade parts from Australia and had them brought over by friends who were visiting Australia and things like that. So it can be really tricky to find, particularly if you've got a game like Lamond 24, right?
There's only a number, you know, a vanishingly small number of those boards still around. And I probably have most of them now because I'm the only person on the planet who cares about that game. But yeah, you know, as they become more rare, they get harder and harder to source and they don't get more reliable.
You know, you can buy one that is new to you, but it will have done, you know, many years of service in an arcade somewhere. So you never really know what condition stuff is going to be in. And certainly with the F355 machine that I picked up, I got in over my head with that, really.
There was just too much stuff to sort out on it. And so I ended up... This is going to sound sacrilegious to some people, but I just couldn't find proper motherboards and stuff for it.
So I've ended up... It's a fully reversible thing, but I've ended up putting PCs in it to run an emulated version of the game for now. And if I ever come across a working full set of the original motherboards, I will swap it back in.
But for the moment, I just had to kind of pull the eject handle on that one.
How do people look at that habit of running emulated PCs? Is there a sort of snobbery from the real thing and that? And also, this is just my ignorance, so please pardon it.
What is the gap in the original machine and something emulating it in terms of the truthful experience, I guess?
I think the key thing you're always battling against with emulation is latency. So these original arcade boards were basically a PCB with a load of chips on it, and so there wasn't a software layer per se in between you and the game. So I think probably if you know the games really well and if it's a real sort of Twitch kind of game, there will be pros who can recognize the latency that is introduced by running an emulated version versus original hardware.
There's a few interesting, not to get too into the weeds about it, but there's a few interesting sort of developments in a FPGA, which is this type of board that has programmable logic gates. So what it can do is recreate other circuit boards, but like custom ones. So what you're getting with these FPGA things is something that is much closer to an original PCB, much closer to original hardware.
It might not be exactly right, but what it does benefit you with is a lot less latency. But at the moment, the problem is that the amount of power that's available on these boards is still kind of limited at the sort of maybe the 32-bit era. But you'd never get something like Model 3 on a standard FPGA board at the moment, because they just don't have the number of logic gates, I suppose, to replicate a board of that complexity.
But I think there's a degree of snobbery about it, but I think the real, like the ultimate crime is, I think, putting LCD screens in instead of CRT screens. Like, people really hate that, because it does look ugly. It does look really ugly.
So as long as I maintain the CRTs in the S355, it would take a real, like, pro to spot that it was running emulated software. But this is the thing, it's like sometimes you just have to, you need something that's going to be reliable, particularly if you're going to put it in a bar somewhere, you need it to be running and not falling over constantly. You know, when I first put the LeMond down in Brighton, I don't live in Brighton, and I was having to nip down to Brighton and swap boards over and pull the thing open and stuff, and it was, you know, it was a bit of a faff.
Touchwood's still running at the moment. I haven't had a text to say anything's gone pop recently, but yeah, to a degree, it's up to you, really. But like, for example, the Astro City, right?
So this is a Japanese sort of metal construction arcade machine. You'd probably recognize it if you saw a picture of it. It's a lovely bit of thing that I don't have any specific nostalgia for because they never existed in the UK when I was a kid, but I do love them as a sort of item, and obviously it has a CRT, and playing games on an arcade stick on a CRT is nostalgic for me.
But I've got Street Fighter II Turbo running in there. But these FPGA boards that you can get now, you can get a connector that will connect to the arcade board. It's called a jammer edge, basically, and you plug it in.
And this FPGA will emulate Street Fighter II Turbo, or any other Street Fighter II variant, absolutely perfectly. It will be indiscernible even to the sort of trained eye, because the latency is the same as an original board, and it's, if not cycle accurate, then close enough that no one would ever notice. So, I think there's some interesting developments there that I think will appease the sort of real hardcore, and there's a lot of...
It's a real sort of game preservation project, the FPGA stuff. I definitely encourage you to sort of check it out, because it applies to consoles as well. So, you know, they have, using these FPGA boards, you can download a core, which is a sort of, I guess, series of instructions for this board, that will perfectly replicate a Super Nintendo, or a Sega Mega Drive slash Genesis.
And you will notice that, you know, the latency is less than if you're running a software emulator. And the accuracy should be better as well, because its objective is to recreate the sort of circuitry within the Super Nintendo or whatever. And they're up to, actually, having slated N64 emulation, there is an FPGA core for N64 that is apparently very good.
Yeah, I just wrote a PS1 sort of FPGA project, I think, during the rounds last week. So, yeah, it's becoming more... They're starting to package it up as something people could understand a little bit more, I think, as well, which probably helps.
Yeah, it's a little bit of a hacky project at the moment, but they're trying to make it more accessible.
Yeah. Sorry, Matthew, do you want to do...
No, I was going to say something really inane, so don't worry.
So, just to do a quick audit, then, Mike, you've got Le Mans F335. Is there a Daytona in the mix as well?
No Daytona. I would love a Daytona. They're really hard to get a hold of.
And again, those boards are, you know, vanishingly rare. I would love a Daytona. For a while ago, there was a full eight player Daytona set up on sale for, I think it was about 10 grand.
And, you know, much as I would love to have been able to put the money down, I had neither the money nor the space to entertain. But that would have been the dream. So yeah, I've got Le Mans F355.
I've got the Astro City, which is running Street Fighter II. I've got the I've got a stand up Sega Naomi cabinet running the original Virtua Tennis, although the screen has broken in that. So I need to repair that.
But Virtua Tennis is brilliant as well. I would love to pick up a crazy taxi because it's my wife's favorite game. And she's very good at it.
So that would be that would be one on the on the shopping list.
But I mean, they don't like gun interest.
Yeah, I love Point Blank. I absolutely adore Point Blank. It's my favorite light gun game.
I think it's just hilarious basically. And so while I love things like Time Crisis and stuff like that and House of the Dead, actually Point Blank is my favorite.
We had a Point Blank in our college JCR that was just very unloved and really. Well, it hasn't been there forever. I never saw anyone look after it, you know, and people resting drinks on it and spilling stuff into it.
That's why I'm surprised you're like, you know, putting your machine in the barcade. I mean, are they very particular about that?
I think most modern places now, there's an understanding that these things are fragile and that you shouldn't put drinks on cabinets. But definitely back in the heyday, you know, every single arcade machine will have had like a jumbo Fanta spilled down the back of it. So, yeah, that's, I mean, it's an absolute killer for obviously printed circuit boards, is to have a load of sticky, sugary liquid poured all over it.
But these days, you know, the places you go these days that are preserving this stuff, I think there's a genuine sort of healthy respect for how fragile they are and how fortunate we are to play them. There's some amazing places. So up in Leeds, there's a place called Arcade Club, which I love to visit when I'm back up in Yorkshire.
And it's just fantastic. It's an incredible collection, beautifully maintained, like, original hardware, no emulation there. It's like, it's all the original boards and stuff.
And they have an entire, you know, team resuscitating these things when they fail and all sorts. So, but yeah, it's amazing. It's like a living museum of video gaming.
And just, yeah, a sort of lost period that I don't think is really relevant to anyone under the age of 30, maybe. Like, none of those people will have grown up with arcades as a going concern. And so I like that they're getting this kind of return.
And a barcade is a sort of... I love a barcade. And they're sort of a necessary evil, right?
Like, I don't think you can run just an arcade anymore unless you have a really sort of wide selection of games. But a barcade is a brilliant place where, you know, people come in for a few drinks and also they will play the machines. So it's cool that it's getting that sort of nostalgic revival from people who have exactly the same sickness that I developed over lockdown.
Yeah, that's fair enough. That was the last thing I was going to ask about this, actually, was that how much do you think arcade gaming is lost to history? I mean, we talk about arcade bars there a little bit.
And I think NQ64 in particular have... You tend to find the same six to eight machines, no matter which one you're in, which is obviously by design. But it is nice that they exist.
And in Tokyo, the scene is largely diminished. I have been told that I need to go and seek out some more independent arcades next time I go there, because they do exist as well. But otherwise, it's basically gacha machines and UFO catches across the board.
But what do you think that culture looks like now? If you wanted to discover the history of this stuff in the UK, how easy do you think it is to go and find it?
I mean, the Arcade Club stuff is a brilliant place to start. It's difficult to overstate how comprehensive their library is. They've got a couple of...
I think they've got three locations. There's one in Leeds, which is pretty big. There's one in Barry, which is the original one.
So that's even bigger, I think. And then there's one in Blackpool, which is a bit smaller. But they have everything from sort of like Frogger and stuff of that era, all the way up to kind of more modern, like the recent-ish 2017 remake of Daytona USA, that, you know, modern machines as well.
So it really is just like, it's a history lesson that you can just wander around. And they've got some amazing stuff. There's a game called Starblade, which is an old space shooter with this massive Fresnel lens, which kind of blows the image up, so it's sort of more immersive.
And there's just all these bizarre bits of, like, lost technology where you would never create a controller that was... For example, there's a game where you sort of pedal on a bike and you're flying around on a, I think it's called prop cycle, flying around on like a flying bicycle and you're pedaling, or the one where you're in river rapids and you're paddling with the... These things are never going to exist as controllers at home.
The only place you can play them is in arcades that have preserved them. So, it's... Yeah, I don't know what the future...
I think the future is purely nostalgia, really. Like, they're still making arcade machines. There's a...
You know, the new Fast and Furious driving game is actually legitimately very entertaining and does something a bit interesting insofar as it has... It has dual screens per driver, but instead of like side by side for sort of wide screen, you know, extra wide screen view, they're stacked on top of each other. And so what they do is play with kind of vertical scale.
And when you go over a jump, you know, you see the entire sort of level laid out in front of you and things. So there are a few sort of interesting modern arcade games, but the concept of an arcade as a place you go to play these things is sort of rapidly diminishing. So I would definitely recommend the Arcade Club.
I think NQ64 do a decent job, but I don't think their machines are as meticulously maintained as the Arcade Club. If you're anywhere near the north of England and you haven't been to Leeds or Bury, those two places are just amazing. You could spend an entire day there playing bizarre bits of arcade history.
I love it. Every time I'm up in Yorkshire for Christmas or whatever, I will make a trip over there.
arcadeclub.co.uk and then you can browse the games on there. The library is dense. It's very, very impressive.
It's enormous.
Yeah, that's cool. More than 1,000 arcade and pinball machines on FreePlay. That's really something.
I definitely want to see that someday.
You pay your 17 quid or whatever it is to get in and everything's on FreePlay. So if you want to go there and just endlessly play Crazy Taxi like my wife does, that's your call or you can go around and play ancient stuff like Burger Time, which I'd never played before or the old Ninja Turtles arcade machines, which were big when I was a kid or Sega Rally, which is a classic.
So it's bad dudes versus Dragon Ninja.
There you go.
Matthew, a couple of bad dudes ourselves. We could go and enjoy that.
Sounds like a great nerdy stag dude.
Oh, it would be perfect. Yeah, it would be absolutely perfect.
That's a great recommendation. Okay. Well, also, well, we've taken up enough of your time, Mike, but I'm really grateful for you coming on.
Thank you so much. Thank you for having me.
It's been lovely to guest and lovely to chat to you guys as well. It's been a while since I've seen Matthew. So, yeah, nice to catch up with him.
Yeah, it's nice knowing you're still out there doing stuff. You know, that's what I always think about Matthew. It's just good knowing he's there.
Of course, yeah. I need that in my life. It may be years before we speak to each other, but it's just good to know that you're out there, Matthew, doing your thing.
Okay, great. Well, Mike, where can people get you on social media?
I am on the X thing still. We'll see how long that lasts. I'm just at Mike Channell.
There's two L's at the end, so that's how you'll find me. I'm at MikeCUK28, which is really uninspiring on Instagram. But the main place you can see me is youtube.com/outsidexbox, where I make videos all the time with Andy and Jane.
And we've been making so many of them. And if you aren't familiar with them, what I suggest you do is go on our big playlist of all the list features and stuff from the beginning and just binge watch the entire thing. And then you'll learn everything there is to know about video games.
Nice.
And yet watch one of the six lists as well as the specified list.
Oh, no, don't watch those ones. It pains me. There's a couple of eights in there as well, though.
So I think it probably evens out.
About seven breakthroughs in arcade hardware.
Yeah, it's a good idea. Do you want to write it for me?
I'll stick it in the ideas silo. Yeah, but yeah, I could talk about the arcade stuff forever. I need to be tempered by my fellow boxbox.
I don't know many people who have that expertise really, so it's nice to be able to tap into it just a little bit on this podcast. Maybe down the line for a couple of years, have you back on, talk about it in more detail.
Thanks. When I've bankrupted myself buying old arcade boards from Australia.
When you've bought eight daytones.
Exactly. I'm living in them because I've been kicked out of my house by my no longer long-suffering wife.
Okay, great stuff. Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
MrBazzlePesto on LooSky and MrBazzle UnderscorePesto on Twitter.
Great. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both those platforms, BackpagePod for the podcast as well, and patreon.com/backpagepod if you want to support what we do.
That's it. Thanks so much, Mike. Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
