Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, I'm pregnant with Nachos. I've eaten about a kilo of them, and I'm ready to talk about Starfield. How are you doing?
Yeah, I mean, that's what a gross introduction. I was gonna do a bit about when you say my name, and then I was gonna very slowly, awkwardly turn around on the spot and say hello, but that's a visual gag, and this is an audio medium.
I feel like I've no sold you on one of your jokes yet again, but it's only because I was clearing my throat due to nachos that I didn't laugh.
One of my favorite things about our recordings is that sometimes laughter, I don't know if it blows the mic out or Discord just doesn't handle it very well, but I won't hear your laughter and I'll be like, oh, a little bit hurt in the recording. And then when I put the episode together, I realized you were laughing. But then there's sometimes where I'm like, I'm assuming that that just blew the mic out and I didn't hear the laugh because of that.
And then I am of course referring to elements of Games Court and then I listen back to it and it's just fucking deathly silence. It's like, okay, right? No, that was just bad.
No, I mean, you caught me on a bad week. I just wasn't in the most like, you know, like chuckling kind of mood really. It was a midweek Games Court.
We got trapped into that because you're away at the weekend or something. I can't remember how that happened. And so, you know, optimal circumstances for Games Court are a weekend morning really, or maybe a weekend evening.
Maybe not Sunday, but you know, the rest of the weekend.
I don't know if there are optimal. I think the optimal conditions for making Games Court was when we made the first two episodes of Games Court and never since.
Yeah, someone in a meeting brought up Games Court with me and I was like, oh God, it's one of those things that's gonna like follow us around now. Yeah, like in a work-related conversation. Someone I was talking to about work listens to the podcast and then just said, oh, you know, I think it referred to me as the creator of Games Courts and I just thought-
Well, co-creator.
Well, it was my idea, but you know, yes.
But what people react to, I think, comes from both of us.
Oh yeah, I mean, we've got like very much a sort of Stanley, Steve Ditko, Spider-Man thing going on here where it's like, yes, I suggested the initial germ of the idea, but like the version of like, your version of drawing Spider-Man and making that design look good is the Matthew Castle Island and it's a sorted accoutrement, you know what I mean?
I'm happy to be the McCartney in our Lennon and McCartney. I'm happy for your name to come first, but I want both names there.
Oh God, that makes, I think we're both McCartney in essence. Actually, I don't know, I think it's, since I watched that-
Come on, we're straight up double Ringo, you know it.
Occasionally three Ringo's and Jeremy joins us or like, or our other guests. No, I mean, you know-
Jeremy's got the energy of, who's that guy in the documentary keeps telling the beat was off?
Do you mean the Austin Powers looking guy? Oh, you mean the posh guy? Do you mean the posh filmmaker?
Michael Watts' face, yeah. It's funny, cause I was watching, when I watched that documentary, I don't know about you, but that documentary gave me such a low impression of John's sort of contributions. Like he just had a sort of like, I'll turn up an hour late and stick my name on it, energy, and I'm like, I'm sure he was brilliant, but that documentary makes him look a bit like, I don't know, he's just sort of like, he's logged on a bit late and now he's just gonna stick his name on this thing.
And Paul did all the work. Did you get that vibe from learning in that documentary? Was that just me?
A little bit. I didn't watch huge amounts of it because I found it quite boring. I'm not like a big Beatles guy.
Why are we talking about the Beatles document? What is this? 2000, when did that even come out?
2020?
Yeah, it was big like pandemic era content, that one. It was a, yeah.
I feel like we've gone through a wormhole with re-litigating the Beatles documentary.
Yeah, we've talked about that Beatles documentary before, because I remember my brother saying to me, you cannot put on another episode of this after it was like a whole hour of like, before going, oh, I think this chord really works on this one, that kind of thing. And it's just like, it's like, we're literally one hour of people just talking like that. And it's, yeah, that classic Peter Jackson style needed an edit.
Why are we talking about this? Starfield. We're here to talk about Starfield, the big RPG from Bethesda, one of the biggest games of the year.
I wouldn't say necessarily a divisive game, but it's certainly a game that's generated spicy takes and some people being down on it, some people being super positive on it. And Matthew doesn't actually know how I feel about it. I don't know how he feels about it.
So we're gonna talk about all of that on this episode. This is a giant game, one of many for people to get through this year. So we're gonna keep it spoiler free just to try and preserve it for people who want to go in blind and enjoy that experience without it having it ruined.
So we've kept that in mind. So Matthew, to start with, we've got our classic section one preamble here. You know, I love a bit of that.
What is your history with Bethesda RPGs? Cause I think that's relevant going into this game.
I bought Morrowind way back when, because it kept appearing in lists of like the greatest PC gamers ever in PC Gamer. This is before, you know, Oblivion and Skyrim were a thing and never really understood it. I don't think my PC could play it properly or if it could play it properly, I didn't really like the way it looked and ran and just behaved.
And it was maybe like a little too, I mean, it's hilarious. So it's a little too hardcore for me. Cause I think Bethesda actually pretty mainstream, but definitely back then, it felt a little bit hardcore.
I didn't have masses to do with them. Not a big Elder Scrolls guy. Haven't probably played more than 10 hours of any of them individually, but did play Fallout 3.
Did really like it. Again, didn't have much relationship with the earlier Fallout games. Found its mix of open world exploration and discovery and light RPG elements super compelling and have sort of enjoyed Fallout since.
But I wouldn't say I'm a huge Bethesda head.
Right, that's interesting. So, okay. That allows me to draw some conclusions about how you probably feel about this.
Shall I do the same thing? Outline my history?
Yeah, I'm interested in what your relationship is.
Yeah, so I've definitely talked about this before, but me and a childhood friend, Donald, rented Morrowind from Blockbuster, which is a terrible idea for a rental, let's face it, in 2003 kind of time. And we basically played it, felt overwhelmed by it, but realized we were looking at something quite impressive. Like the, you know, it was very much a game that had been talked up as, it's amazing they're bringing this to Xbox, it's open world, it's like, you know, it's quite, there are simulation elements, it's quite a dense game.
So it was a kind of experience you just couldn't get on PS2. And that was, it was like a big, that and KotL were big deals for us as Xbox players. They were like these RPGs coming to console for the first time that just seemed like a big deal.
So checked it out, we bounced off of it, got absolutely fucked up by all of the enemies in the game, just like really, really hard. We did struggle with it. And I would say that I put Bethesda RPGs out of my mind again.
I mean, I didn't really know who Bethesda were at the time, honestly. They weren't really a going concern for me. Like I feel like the profile of Bioware was very much elevated around the time Neverwinter Nights came out.
Like people knew what Baldur's Gate was. And so when I was reading about them and PC Gamer, they seemed like a huge deal. Bethesda RPGs, like I know Morrowind was very much a cult success, but I don't think they really crossed over in the mainstream until you get to Oblivion.
And at that point, they become the biggest, the hottest thing in RPGs, right? That is, that's very much what happens when Oblivion comes along. This massive RPG that looks incredible, launches on Xbox 360 and PC.
So again, like a big moment for the RPGs making the excursion to console players. And I played it a little bit later, a little bit after the hype, but I was, you know, the hype was huge for this one. I remember reading, you know, these features that would talk up this very dense simulation and the idea of like, you know, you will piss off one NPC, they come and find you ages later.
And just how amazingly detailed this world was. I could very much see that they had, you know, solved some of the accessibility problems of Morrowind, making it a lot easier to sort of like get your head around. And so Oblivion solved that.
Played it, I bounced off it a little bit. I was very impressed by it, like the, you know, the spectacle of it coming out of the dungeon for the first time and seeing the world and getting into it. But admittedly, the fiction didn't massively grab my imagination.
I'm a little bit sort of up and down on high fantasy settings. Not all of them capture my imagination, right? So, was impressed by it, very much disappointed my friend Andrew, who was the biggest Oblivion head.
I just couldn't get into it in the same way. He disappointed me with GTA IV, he hated that. And I couldn't get into Oblivion.
So we let each other down and it was, you know, our friendship overcame it, but it was a challenge. But Fallout 3 was the game that really brought me in. So, you know, 2008 launches on all platforms, PS3, 360, PC, amazing, amazing undertaking, I think.
Just translated this post-apocalypse kind of nuclear, irradiated landscape setting from these older PC RPGs into modern third-person game with action elements, a bit of VATS as well to give you some sort of like, you know, turn-based style sort of precision. So a really nice mix of real-time and turn-based kind of like combat systems in there. Like quite an amazing thing.
Great quests, great side quests, meaningful choices. I think we can all agree that blowing up the bomb detonated, like destroying that town and watching it from Tenpenny Tower is quite amazing. I have forgotten the name of the town though, which is Megaton.
Megaton.
Yeah, of course, so obvious.
Boomtown.
When I see people worshiping brands on Twitter now actually, and I see this a lot in the game space, I think of the citizens of Megaton quite a lot, the people who worship that bomb. Like that's basically what they remind me of instantly. Not a very nuanced take, but I just wanted to chuck that in there, Matthew.
So yeah, I always thought that was incredible. And from there, there is obviously New Vegas, which is a bit closer to the, I guess the more freeform RPG style in terms of how that game was made. But two years later, a very good new version of the same type of thing comes along from Obsidian.
You get to Skyrim 2011, the biggest deal in games at the time for sure. I think like really amped up the visual side of the game from Oblivion. Like it feels almost a generation long Skyrim from Oblivion, just because they do some amazing things with the art direction, this kind of like snowy world and how the dragons look and how the mammoths look.
It feels even more alive than before. I like it, but I don't love it, honestly. That's how I felt about Skyrim.
Again, I played Skyrim for 40 hours, but I couldn't really tell you anything I did in that time, apart from the dragons I killed and the mammoths I killed and the little house I built on the side of a hill.
I mostly watched Andy Kelly rotating props on the loading screen when he was reviewing it in the games hub. Skyrim is one of the classic games hub games along with Batman Arkham City.
That period felt like it was the last huge moment for that generation of consoles, too. Just a lot going on in late 2011, so a big deal. And I liked it, but Fallout was the one I really loved.
And then, so you skip ahead. I realized Matthew, I'm delivering a much longer version of this in the unit.
No, this is good. I suddenly feel very sheepish about my, don't really like Elder Scrolls, played a bit of Fallout, and that's about it, really. And then you come out with this fucking Ted Talk.
So you get to 2015 and Fallout 4 comes along. I would say it very ever so slightly misses my expectations of it, creatively. It's got this, like much, the funny thing I would say about Bethesda games, this applies to Starfield as well, is they always look what you remember the previous generation's games looking like.
I played Fallout 4 and I thought, isn't this what Fallout 3 looked like? And I went back and looked at Fallout 3 and I was like, oh no, no, Fallout 4 does look better than this. But because they have this quite, I guess like amazing technology in terms of how much stuff they can house and they can sort of keep track of at once, the games never feel like they're cutting edge visually, right?
I mean, Oblivion arguably was, but since then I don't think they really have. They've never been like the best looking games necessarily. And before I had that thing again where I'm like, okay, I got to just check.
Nope, this does look better than 3. But in terms of like the main quest, I think in 4 was a little bit not under baked, but just it was a bit in the shadow of 3, right down to the fact that the final set piece is kind of lifted from 3, feels like kind of a rerun. Some really good companions though, and some great side quests in there.
The world though, I think there was just something about it that felt like a rerun from Fallout 3 that just meant it didn't quite blow me away, or at least like the new feature they added, the key new feature, settlement building, not my kind of thing, dog, even though I wish everyone who plays it and enjoys it the best, of course. From there, you have Fallout 76, which is obviously like a big disappointment for Bethesda. I only ever played it at launch, but I did think that despite the fact I had no human NPCs and lacked a bit of purpose, I didn't think it was quite as bad as people said it was.
And it did have, I think, like a five-star Bethesda open world. The setting is actually amazing. It's just that it didn't have that much compelling stuff in it.
Did you ever take on that, Matthew?
No, I agree. I enjoyed the world. I enjoyed the kind of color palette of that sort of autumnal look.
It was a little bit more lived in. I mean, the mad thing was with everyone dunking on it, is I didn't think it was actually miles away from what a good Fallout game is. And a lot of its problems, I would say, are similar in both that and Fallout 4, or even Elder Scrolls as well.
This sort of scoffing, I never quite understood, because you're like, well, it's not like the thing you love is that much more sophisticated than this. And the core magic of like, what's that mystery blip on the radar? Oh, it's a weird haunted house.
Oh, it's a Coca-Cola factory. It's a weird old bowling alley or whatever. That is like the best bit, I would say, of Fallout.
And that is in Fallout 76 in space.
Yeah, absolutely. I think they had the No Man's Sky thing, where I think if they'd just said it was an early access game, then they would have been fine. And they could have said, when they added the human NPC stuff, that they could have done the full release then.
And I think that would have completely improved sentiment on it. But because it arrived in like box form, it's like the game's complete and ready to go. And of course it was a live service game.
So it actually had like a long tail left and people are still playing it now. And it actually runs quite nicely on Xbox Series X. I don't know, I think it's unfairly maligned, not like perfect by any means, but it was better than people said it was, I think.
I built quite a nice house on, there's a golf course. What was it called? Was it called Green Acres or Spring?
It had like a leafy name, like Spring Leaf or Green Acres or something like that. And it was weird, because in this like post-apocalyptic world, it was actually quite untouched. It was like a pristine golf course, maybe like the robots have been tending to it or something.
And so by building my house there, it was actually, when I looked out my front window, it kind of looked like we weren't in the post-apocalypse. It kind of looked like the dreamy 50s of kind of pre-nukes. I quite like that about it, that it wasn't all just scorched earth.
There were like pockets of quite regular, there was still a load of fucking zombie golfers everywhere or whatever. But that was fine, because I could just sit on my little house balcony and shoot them with a sniper rifle, which was quite a nice pastime.
That is pretty cool. That's a nice, great experience. Is that one of your last Xbox on games, Matthew?
Were you on RPS at that point?
No, I was on RPS. We did quite good business with our Fallout 76 videos, because all you have to do to do a successful Fallout 76 video is get that bit of character art of Vault Boy doing a downwards thumb, and stick that on the thumbnail, and everyone thinks you're being like, yeah, you're sticking it to the man. And it's the closest I've come to kind of flirting with being a hate preacher, where I was like, maybe it's not as bad as everyone says, but it is still quite bad.
The closest I've flirted with becoming a hate preacher is when I called Hotel Dust a languid on this podcast two weeks ago.
Yeah, that wasn't flirting. That was full dive bombing into the hate pool, splashing hate all over us.
So that was the weird thing about it. It was obviously like quite an imbalanced game in terms of the amount of stuff in it, but I thought the overworld and the lovely little map they give you in the game to navigate that overworld, great stuff. I was quite taken with all of that.
I thought, you know what? You've got the bones of a good Fallout game in here if you build the right stuff on top of it. So yes, that's how I felt.
But I mean, whether it hit those, it kind of reached its full potential or not, I couldn't say, but it certainly kept going, which would suggest.
It kept setting off nukes, that was annoying as well. Because it had a mechanic where if you collected like the nuclear codes, you could just fire a nuke at a bit of the map and then it would just like wreck it and you'd pray that it wasn't my precious golf course.
That would be tough to log back on and see your golf course just in smithereens. That's not good. Okay, so that's basically my history with Bethesda RPGs, Matthew.
So I would say that I guess I'm sort of neutral on them really. They can blow me away but I'm not always massively taken with them. So that's the baggage I bring to Starfield, I guess.
With that in mind, Matthew, was it a big deal to you when Starfield was announced at E3 2018? Were you waiting Bethesda to do a next big thing?
Not really. As a non-Elder Scrolls head. Again, I think, like you, I just didn't really like its fantasy world as much.
I was glad that they weren't doing more of that. I was like, oh cool, you know, like I might actually be interested in it. Space, you know, that's kind of cool, I could see why they would want to do that genre-wise.
But it's not like… I don't hold them in the esteem of like, I would wait for a new Mario or Zelda or, you know, the things that I like from listening to this podcast. They're not like a, oh shit, Bethesda are talking, I better listen, you know, that isn't my relationship with them at all.
Like, it's been too hit and miss for that.
Yeah, I think that's fair. I was more like, it's cool they're making a new universe, that's absolutely cool, especially because the statement of intent seemed to be, it's not just one world, it's a whole systems and part of a galaxy to explore. So I was impressed by that promise of that, I guess, but I didn't want to get too carried away, maybe it's because it was off the back of 76 where it wasn't like the response was just so withering that maybe optimism didn't feel like the default point of view at that moment.
Yeah, also, it was just a name and a logo, right? It wasn't even a thing at that point.
Yeah, I think there was also, I mean, they did show some space and Starfield in itself tells you what the game is about, right?
Like, is in some ways the title is the tease, because it's like people losing their minds over that, like Elder Scrolls map or screenshot that was released when they announced that. And like, the amount of times I've seen that image kind of bought out, it's just, it's just not a thing yet, you know, it's clearly not a thing. So yeah, getting even if I was into it, I'd, I'd struggle to get excited about it.
One thing I do quite like about Bethesda is that they're, they're not the biggest team, right? You know, they're, they're meant to be like, relatively small by these kind of triple A standards.
That cannot be true with this game, though. It's just too big.
I mean, yeah, maybe they've scaled up, but it was always the, again, this could just be a PR line, but they've always sort of sold themselves as a scrappy little outfit. And it's everyone who's, everyone's been here for like 25 years and, you know, it's the same people who were making the earlier games are making these games. And I follow a couple of people who worked there who seem very nice and very switched on and have good game thoughts.
I always, always actually feel a little pang of guilt, I guess, on Twitter when I am not as into their things because I'm like, well, this person seems cool. I wish I liked their thing a bit more.
I will also say as well that I, okay, so there's a few things there. So I agree with you about about the people. So I think that Emil Pagliarulo, who's like the one of the lead designers or lead writer or something like that, he's been there forever because I remember doing like interviews with him for Fallout 3.
So, you know, it's impressive that people, you know, it seems like they've retained a lot of key talent and the game and it means the games always have their DNA in them quite it's quite forthright to you as a player that you are playing a Bethesda RPG. So the essence of what those games are has not been lost. And also, the other thing is that they actually do really like the way they sell their games and in the sense of like, they basically just made their own E3 conference for this one game and it was so comprehensive and it got people so excited.
It told you it told you loads, but it didn't tell you everything. I actually quite like that approach to sort of like, well, you know, obviously, we didn't get to play it beforehand. So you might have different opinions on that.
Like there was no there were no impressions as far as I know of what the game actually was before launch. It was down to reviews, but it did. It does feel like a real moment.
They make a real moment out of it. And it does. I think even if it takes a few years, Starfield in this case did stoke my excitement because that reveal in June was pretty impressive, I thought.
So, you know, they are good hype masters as well.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. So that's a useful context, I think. But Matthew, I suppose before we get into the game itself, what do you think this game means to Microsoft in the lifespan of the Xbox Series X and S?
Because obviously we're a few years down the line now from Microsoft buying Bethesda. The state of the industry has changed quite a lot. The state of acquisitions has changed quite a lot.
They've slowed down significantly. There's a lot going on, it would seem, behind the scenes with some games companies, if you may. If you read some of the headlines during the rounds.
I'd be mortified if my emails leaked like that.
Yeah.
Because you'd be like, oh, please don't say I was like a dick in any of those emails or could be perceived as a dick.
I feel bad though, because I don't actually think any of them come off that badly in those emails. But that one Nintendo email just makes them look like, just complete like, you know, there's like a gap there of sort of like misunderstanding where they're going to get roasted for it for years. I'm like, they actually seem like pretty level heads when you read the rest of their emails.
I mean, it's true though. It would be like an amazing trophy to bag, but anyway, you know, it's not like a wild sentiment. I mean, it's unlikely, but it's got to have a dream, right?
For those who are curious, this is a leaked email from a few years ago of Xbox wanting to buy Nintendo. This is 2020, the email Matthew, I think it was something like that. Yeah, a long time ago now, but it was quite, yeah, quite some quite wild Microsoft documents around that are out there now and being dissected by the various gaming leaks and rumours channels.
Really I don't know how it happened. It's completely out of control. Just ridiculous.
But I do actually feel bad for them because there's just too much out there. And I agree with you. If you leaked my emails, you'd realize what a fucking idiot I am.
You know what I mean?
I'm just horrible. I'm not so horrible as other people.
Amazing. So, I suppose, yeah. Back to the question, then.
Yes.
Lifespan of the Xbox. What does it mean that this game is here now and what this game is relative to the Xbox platform?
I actually didn't make notes for this one, so I'm not going to lie.
Oh, it's a bit Piers Harding, Tubby Rolls element.
It's kind of an interesting game pass game in that it will presumably encourage ongoing subscriptions just through sheer scale, rather than having the hallmarks of a service game, which people logically say normally a lot of the things you try and get into these subscriptions are service games or things that kind of keep people hooked where this, that, what delivers that here and in previous Bethesda games is just the size of them and the fandom that that inevitably builds around those worlds, you know, it's the, it's the, it's whatever it is that keeps people playing Skyrim for a thousand hours, even though nothing new has been added to Skyrim. I don't even know what you'd call it. What, what, what?
Stickiness, I guess.
They are famously sticky games. So having that as like a, you know, a big, a big hit in your service makes sense. They haven't really got anything else like this yet, you know, a big open world adventure.
They are working on them, we are led to believe with like Fable and whatnot.
Avald, Matthew, your big avald head.
Avald's going to be something slightly different though, right?
It seems like Outer Worlds with fantasy. That's kind of the vibe I got for it.
Right, all that kind of scale. Yeah, like a kind of an obsidian scaled RPG, which I know what that means in my head. And I'm not going to explain it on this podcast.
Why should you?
And they definitely need it because otherwise, you know, you've got Forza, but Forza like really, especially Dry Forza, which it is this year, isn't for everyone. So it's about as strong as offering as they've had. We always knew this was going to be like a bit of a crown jewel in it.
So what does it mean for the future of Xbox? You know, the countdown for the next Bethesda game has already begun, it seems. Because that's what we do.
We wait eight years, SEO the shit out of everything for one week and then start SEOing the shit out of the next thing that doesn't exist yet.
Oh, it's so true. So yeah, it is a little bit. It's an interesting one as well because this game has a larger footprint beyond Xbox.
Obviously, the Bethesda RPGs have a huge PC lineage. So you have like, you know, probably a couple million people playing on Steam as well. And then obviously PC Game Pass as well.
So yeah, I do agree with you. It does seem like a match made in heaven. It's, you know, let's face it, this is the game that Microsoft bought Bethesda for, right?
I mean, I'm sure the rest of the stuff, the rest of the studio is in there and the games they're working on, you know, there's a really high quality bar there, I think. But this is the game they wanted, right? This was, like you say, the crown jewel.
So yeah, I think it's a huge deal to Xbox. And like you say, I think it will keep people like dipping into Game Pass for years and years. Just knowing it's there is like such a staple.
It's like, you know, it's like having, I don't know, I wish I had a better example than this. But you know, when they put like having the Simpsons on Disney Plus or Friends on Netflix, you know what I mean? It just, it's the thing you become synonymous with.
It's the thing you get people coming back to you for. So I sort of get it. I think it makes sense.
All right. That's enough context, I reckon. It's time to talk a bit more about the game itself.
The Friends of open world RPGs.
Yeah, that sounds like damning praise, doesn't it?
Is it early Simpsons? Was it late Simpsons? We will find out in this chat.
So what did you make of the critical reception coming into it, Matthew? It got mostly very positive reviews, a couple of outliers in there, a few sevens as well. What did you make of all that?
It just felt like loads of people were kind of like navigating the kind of expectations around this game, rather than maybe just drilling into like pure and simple, what is good, what is bad about this game. Like there was a lot of weirdness in the reviews, I thought. And the whole thing was, I thought, a little polluted by all that mess over like who did and didn't and get code and all that stuff kind of.
It makes you a little bit like, is this like a sanctioned review? Is that weird? I don't know, whatever.
I think there's been some better things written since, you know, I've really enjoyed the kind of ongoing coverage from like PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun. I thought Chris's review on Eurogamer was excellent, just really, really thorough. And I know how it is with these games, you know, they're so massive.
Eight years in the making, it's the big thing from the big studio. And it's sometimes hard to kind of like get a grip on those things that I think they can escape you. I didn't find it like a very rewarding time to be like reading about this game for various reasons.
I had an interesting experience. I thought that like Chris Livingstone's review on PC Gamer was excellent. I thought it was a really great piece of writing that was also instructional because it encouraged you to select a certain perk in the game, which I did do and have not regretted doing.
That was a great call. Chris's review was really good. Also, Chris is like a genuine authority on Bethesda RPGs.
He just covered the mod scene endlessly and wrote about it endlessly. When I saw people giving shit to PC Gamer for it, I'm like, you are dealing with someone who's a genuine authority on this and you're lucky that someone is around who can give this level of authority to review. So fuck you, basically.
That's kind of how I felt reading a lot of those comments. Some of the comments out there generally were just terrible from fanboys, obviously.
So maybe I'll modify my take a little bit and say that I think one of the challenges with the game is that I think your relationship with it will change drastically. And over the course of it, I've only played a small chunk, but even in that, like my opinion has gone all over the place. And I think where you finally land on this game will depend on so many factors.
It's an unusually unruly game in that regard, in terms of I think two people can have two very different experiences, like radically different experiences and review it, you know, get completely different into the spectrum as a result. And like just having to like put down the pad and pick up the pen. And like when you make that call with a game of this size, that would be a fucking nightmare, I think.
I don't know really what the fuck I would write in a review about it if you put a gun to my head right now, which is why this episode is going to be terrible.
I also really like Simon Parkins' review on The Guardian. I thought actually like succinctly boiled down, like what's great about this game, what's maybe more like more flawed or more contentious, maybe not contentious, but you know, the sort of like rickety was the word Simon used in his headline. I think that's actually quite a fair description of like some of the quirks that you see in a Bethesda RPG.
So yeah, but every review I've read has been pretty fair, like from the positive, really positive ones to the more middling ones, it seems, and I say by middling, I mean seven, which is still above average, so that's important to say that. But a couple of things I thought is that we are so used to what a Bethesda RPG is now that all these games get these games that any game they make now is reviewed through that prism. What's unusual about Bethesda games is like Starfield, you know, you can see the DNA going back is just so obvious, like it's from the way NPCs move to the way that dialogue works, the way the quests are designed, like it's all the same stuff that's been there before, with more bits layered on top of it, but that's where it differs to something like the difference between The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk, you know, that's the same studio that made that, but those games, you wouldn't necessarily think that the same studio made both of them, do you know what I mean?
Like it's, they're quite imperceptible. Bethesda RPGs are quite specific in the sense that they, you can always tell you're playing a Bethesda RPG, like you just give you two minutes and you're going to figure out who made that game, if you have any kind of knowledge of games, it's just, just run around and talk to an NPC, you'll realise you're playing a Bethesda RPG. So everyone brings that baggage to it, I think, which either means that they're huge fans and they're reviewing it with that in mind, that maybe there's a particular game that they like, like we do, Fallout, or whether it's like, you're a big Skyrim head, which seems to be the case for a lot of people, and you can't help but review the game with that in mind.
In some ways, you can't make a clear break when you're reviewing a Bethesda RPG because the DNA of it is just so obvious, it's just so entrenched in the recent history of games that it just overshadows it to some extent, do you know what I mean? You are always reviewing it with that in mind, so that was my larger thought, Matthew. But fuck me, we've been talking for ages.
Let's find out what we think of the game now. So we haven't talked to each other about this game while we've been playing it, and we decided we'd guess what the other person thought of the game. So I guess, Matthew, let's do that.
What do you think I thought of it, then I'll guess what you thought of it?
I think you quite like, I think you're going to have quite liked Starfield or what you've played of it. I think it's going to have made you quite nostalgic for what you liked about the Fallout games particularly. For that very reason you just laid out there that DNA is so obvious, but rather than kind of mark it down for that, I think you'll say actually it holds up.
It's a good formula. I can see why you'd stick to it.
Interesting. So for you, I would guess you are a bit down on this in the way that you're down on most of these games. They haven't really massively won you over with some highlights along the way that made you question it, but ultimately where you're at now, which is still early in the game, you're sort of like, I'm not totally feeling this.
That's my guess. I should say whether you were correct first. You are almost there.
I would say nostalgia is not really a factor though. In some ways I think that I wish it could shed more of that DNA and feel a bit fresher in the way it feels. I think that just when seeing an NPC turn towards you in that particular way, the camera zooming in that particular way, I was like, in some ways I wish we could aesthetically redo how these games are presented, you know what I mean?
Just because it's so, I'm just like, yeah.
They have moved that on a tiny bit in ways which are cute. Like, if a character is turning away, they'll start off turning away and then they'll kind of like, as they're talking, they'll kind of turn around as if to be like, oh, and let me just turn to face you and then I'll look you in the eye. Or if there are multiple people in the conversation, there's a hint that they sort of acknowledge each other, that you aren't just standing in the middle of like four people, like a weird totem pole, and everyone's just bellowing their opinions straight at you.
Conversations can kind of happen in this game in a way that they haven't in the previous games.
That's true. Also, the game's presentation, like the lip-syncing and animations are really, really good, so you'll just meet even minor characters where there's a massive improvement there. But what about my take on your opinions, Matthew?
Am I right there? Yeah.
I maybe like it a little bit more, actually.
Interesting. So, yeah, I suppose, like, let's get into it then. So I've played 24 hours of it so far.
How about you?
Right. Yeah, I've played 25 hours, but five of those hours was my first character who I just wasn't feeling it. Like, I went in and was just doing the main quest line, and I thought, after about five hours, I was like, oh, this is fucking awful, I hate this game so much.
And I thought, you know what, I'm just going to start again, I'm just going to go, now I sort of know what I'm dealing with or what to expect. I'm kind of going to go in and just kind of take it at my own pace from the off and see if I did get a bit more. So I've done 20 hours of that as well.
Okay, interesting. That is an interesting choice because I'm not sure I could stand the repetition of doing the quests again. But I guess that was a choice you felt like you needed to make.
So fair enough.
Yeah, I just heard enough people say, oh, you should do this before you do this quest line. I saw some people say certain side quests are almost a better introduction to the world or a better tutorial than what the main quest line is. And I actually I agreed with them and I did have a better time as a result.
Interesting. So my big take on this is there is a formula at work here, but this is a really fucking good version of that formula. And it's like having an excellent cheeseburger or something.
I know this formula inside and out, but I've played quest after quest I was really, really impressed by. And the scale of it, while I think there's a lot of debate has focused on the way that the world quote unquote is laid out in this game, i.e. you have to move between planets on a spaceship, which involves a lot of fast travel, some space travel.
The stuff they've laid on top of it for the most part really impresses me. And I just think that actually this formula is still great at presenting great, you know, terrific RPG style quests where you can make interesting choices, there are interesting outcomes and you'll have like some fun along the way because the objectives will have some nice variety to them, there'll be a set PC feel to some of the missions. I think this actually like this really nails what I love about a Bethesda RPG in so many ways.
And I think I just sort of there's a point where I was just like using a samurai sword to cut a mech apart and I was like I'm having a fucking great time. That's what I just that just really that really hit me like a couple of nights ago when I was playing out. Like this is actually like a really great version of this this type of game site to to to me like the the polish with which they've like executed all of these quests and and built this game.
That's that's the difference to me is it just feels like them pushing it further in terms of execution as well as scale. Like I just don't remember enjoying Fallout 4 this much. Like none of the quests really stuck with me in that way.
And here are just some of the optional objectives that give you a great some of the outcomes that give you a great the dialogue choices. It's like not all gold. It's like a lot of conversations.
I'm sort of like maybe my attention span has drifted a bit in recent years. I'm just sort of like hammering through a little bit just to get to the next bit. But generally, I think this is great.
I think it's just a really amazing undertaking. It's maybe not the most interesting sci-fi universe ever created, but I think that's a criticism you could probably apply to the Elder Scrolls as a fantasy universe as well. So yeah, what's your big take, Matthew?
I kind of like it when it's just tapping into the stuff Bethesda's always done quite well of, you find an interesting place, you go into an interesting place, there's maybe a weird person in there who gives you an interesting quest. Like you say, there's a few variations in how you do it. There's just enough role playing in terms of like character build.
You can crouch and deal with the game's wonky stealth systems like you can in Fallout, or you can hack a load of computers and turn robots against people or whatever. Like all that stuff is stuff that I liked in Fallout and I like it here and I think it does benefit a little bit from that polish, like you say, like feels a little bit nicer. So much of my problem I think with Bethesda's games, particularly the fantasy ones, on paper what you're doing is fine, but the actual feel of it is very unsatisfying.
Like I've never liked their melee combat, which is like a huge mark against Elder Scrolls and this, you know, the gun, the gun, the gunplay is, is, is definitely better and this is probably the best it's been. So that all works. And once you've found like a little build that kind of works for you and lets you play in your desired style, which can take a little while, like it's, there's some stuff with the skill tree in this where I feel like some basic toys are actually locked off quite early on until you've invested a few points here and there.
And for me, that was like getting into the stealth of it and the lockpicking and finding some suppressed guns and things and once I could do that, I was much happier. What I don't quite get is, I think there are like loads of pockets where in the moment I'm just like, oh yeah, this is like Fallout 3 and I'm having fun. But I find the game they've built around it and the way that they've tried to frame it with space travel and with these entire planets you can explore.
I find that stuff almost worthless, particularly the planet exploration. I've done a lot of like, well, what happens if I just drop down here and let's see what crazy thing emerges and the planet game is very, very poor. It's like an even drier no man's sky, I think.
Scan a load of boring plants or scan a load of boring looking aliens or here's one of 20 cave templates that we'll load in or here's one of 20 bases. I do think they've lost the connective tissue that makes those worlds a thrill to discover. There's nothing in here to replicate that thing I mentioned in Fallout 76 of like, there is an outline of something on your compass and as you walk towards it, it fills in and you're like, what is that?
You get sent to lots of interesting places and I think lots of characters kind of go oh, you've got to go to this planet, something's happened and that's this game's version of that but I do miss, I don't know, I guess I miss the on foot exploration but that isn't what space exploration is so maybe it was unfair to kind of expect that of it.
It's a really, it's really interesting because this is the most divisive part of the game for sure. It's like you don't have the, like you say, that magic thing of what's that on the horizon line? Oh, it's a Nuka Cola factory or whatever it is, you know, that you get from a Fallout or Elder Scrolls game.
So, yeah, and it's true that you don't necessarily get that on any of the individual worlds. But what I will say is, because I don't think, I don't think that's an entirely a net loss for the reason that it means it can show you, it can give you a lot more spectacle that you typically get from a Bethesda RPG. Let's just set in one location.
Like the planets you go to are more varied than any individual location. The individual locations are relative to each other in an Elder Scrolls or Fallout, do you know what I mean? So there's like, there are a bunch of cities in this game, and all the cities are very distinctive from each other.
And you couldn't really picture the city of Neon, I assume you've gone there, Matthew. You couldn't, I couldn't really picture that being in the same place as like, a killer city or New Atlantis, it kind of makes sense that those are different planets. And so that's why I think the upside is that you get taken to a wider variety of places than you otherwise would do if you were just going along one big map.
But whether that's a net gain or not, like it's up for debate.
It's interesting because there's all kinds of sliding scales in this game of like what is gained and lost by having this, not just scale, but like also the setting of it. You know, like the thing I found most striking about it is your behavior in this world and what makes sense in this world and what makes sense in Fallout, which is a scavenger society. It's like very different.
The clutter and filling your bag with loads of like weird shit in Fallout because you're going to cobble something together, that makes a lot more sense than a seemingly sophisticated astronaut guy has a house and is part of like a modern, normal society, kind of collecting all this shit. And that was almost one of my problems with that first character I made, is that I went in playing Fallout, collecting loads of stuff and being very aware of like, oh, I've got to, I've got to have all this shit. And actually, like, that isn't what this game is about at all.
Like that doesn't really make sense in this world. Like they've really stripped out even more of the survival stuff. Like I don't think the guns have like wear and tear on them, for example.
Like ammo doesn't have a weight. Like it's really trying to simplify and streamline a lot of the experiences so you can just sort of enjoy, enjoy the journey a lot more. And that's maybe the difference to their other games, where I think the journey is meant to be like a bit harder, you're meant to feel like you're sort of striving.
And here you kind of get to like power or satisfaction a bit faster. And I do like that about it, actually, like that does give it its own character.
Well, you do and you don't, because like you say, the skill trees are oddly stingy. Like you get one skill point.
Yeah, that aside, I guess.
But at the same time, you're handed a spaceship to go and explore this galaxy, like right at the start of the game. So that happens in hour one. So yeah, you know, in some ways it really does.
And then in some ways it makes you wait. So it's yeah, it is interesting. Sliding.
Yeah, sliding scales is an interesting way of putting it. And it's funny as well that it has all these like these stations for, you know, research and like tweaking your weapons and stuff. And I'm a bit like, whenever I go into those, you know, it's not my sort of thing.
I feel like you can ignore it though, right?
I think that you can for the most part, but it makes sense to do the research bits for like the food and tools or whatever, because that can clear out your overstuffed inventory.
But yeah, it definitely feels like there's almost two games in one. There's the very focused, like authored content, which is the stuff that I do enjoy and am reacting well to, you know, which is all the missions and the side missions. And then the whole kind of planetary ecosystem, like go anywhere, explore anywhere, that feels like it's part of just a kind of resource collecting economy, which in itself is tied to building outposts, customizing ships, basically user generated stuff, which I don't give a fuck about in Bethesda games, never have, never will.
I like that you kind of aren't forced into that. I think there would be a way to more elegantly tempt me into it. You're like, I literally had a robot went, do you want to go and build an outpost?
And I was like, absolutely not. Like that sounds like hell on earth. Like I know that that's going to mean working with your horrible building interfaces from Fallout 4.
I'm not interested. And so I haven't done any of that. But because of that, like collecting fucking copper extract from the planet's surface, I'm like, well, why would I do this?
Like this, this feels like this is for building something that I'm not going to ever engage with. But that's fine. Like you don't have to connect with that.
Like in Fallout 4, that more procedural side of the game, I guess, felt a lot more invasive. Mainly because they had it. They literally gave it like human form in...
Is it Preston Garvey?
Yeah.
Who was like just constantly there to go, let's go and build some boring stuff and protect a little boring people the whole time. You're like, oh man, like you're guilting me into playing this bit of the game. And so far it hasn't done that.
Maybe it will. Maybe I haven't met Space Garvey.
Yeah. Also the thing was like they used to have the number of people in a town ticking down, letting you know that your settlement was fucking up and you have to go and sort it out basically in Fallout 4. And I just again like, oh, well, I guess that place is abandoned forever.
Never mind. I won't go there again. Like there's a bit of that to it.
And yeah, it's true. This is a bit more elegantly layered so you can kind of like take or leave that stuff. I think I just like fitted a light to one of my guns or something.
I was like, yeah, that's fine. That's it for me in this system. I think just give me a fucking gun that can fire bullets explode or something and we'll be well on our way.
So yeah, yeah, I think I think I agree that it's not too overwhelming on that front. Matthew, I was curious to know what you think of the very start of the game because this seems to be the area where there was the most agreement that it doesn't totally work. And I think I agree.
Basically it's like you're in a mine and it's like being a blue collar worker at a sci-fi universe. Am I right? It's like that sort of thing.
You're a real one basically and then something happens with an artifact and you basically have a larger mission to go and execute. You're taken to New Atlantis, which is probably the most boring setting in the game. It's just this big Mass Effect Citadel style shiny and clean sci-fi setting that doesn't really have many areas that are that exciting to explore and maybe sets actually too lower bar for what the game actually gives you, actually offers you if you get out there and find it.
So what did you make of that first stretch of the game?
Really unexceptional. They've done some fantastic openings to games. I love the opening to Fallout 3, the whole kind of like, your whole life flashing before your eyes.
I think that's just so fun and playful and in a sci-fi setting where you've got all these worlds and all this like weird tech, you know, the potential is just crazy. And then what they opt for, like you say, is walking through quite a boring line. And then the first surface you step onto of this mining planet, and it's just this like giant concrete landing pad and some gray rocks.
And it's so underwhelming compared to like emerging from the prison in Oblivion. Or, you know, I'm not saying the Wasteland in Fallout 3 is like, wow, beautiful, but there's a certain wow factor for to like the scale of the sort of desolation of it and the wow, this isn't what I was expecting, but this is just sort of like, yep, bleak old space. And then, yeah, you're right, you go to definitely the most like boring, boring area in the game, New Atlantis.
And with some like quite bad hangs, like I'm not super into what I've played of the main quest line, which revolves around this like organization of explorers called Constellation. And they're all a little bit worthy. If you kind of go with what the game pushes you towards in terms of your first main quest, you get lumbered with this companion who I ditched her as soon as I could, like very bad vibes of her.
And I think, did you call her SpaceTory on Twitter?
That was Chris Schilling. I merely agreed.
SpaceTory, that was great. That's why those first five hours with that first character, you know, I was hanging out with them a lot and was like, oh man, is this really it? Like, you know, eight years and to hang out with these...
Eight years!... these fucking boring bastards. And the thing I actually did differently, and I don't think this is a spoiler, this is a very early quest.
The first quest that you kind of do with Constellation involves getting a piece of information from a guy who works with the, is it the United Collective, is that what they're called, the UC?
Freestyle Collective?
No, the United Colonies.
I mean, this again sums up some of the problems with the lore of the game, like, yeah, right.
No, it's the United Colonies, who are kind of like the Federation, right, I think?
Yeah, you were.
Like, they're the kind of like, legit, boring face of civilization in the universe, rather than like, the Cowboys.
Yeah.
Rather than the Firefly Brigade. And when you go there, this guy will kind of send you on this boring quest line, or you can like, sign up and enlist with the colonies here, and that was the quest people said, oh, you should really do that, because it actually gives you like, a much better kind of grounding in the story of this universe so far, like, you literally have a, what's it called, your first day at work, not indoctrination. What's the word I'm thinking of?
Induction.
Induction. Induction. Welcome to your indoctrination.
I mean, induction. That's the joke I'd make if I was an HR guy doing that talk.
That's what you'll hear Matthew say at the first Back Page: live show, it's like, welcome to the indoctrination.
Welcome to the indoctrination. Oh, oh, sorry, wrong notes, I meant induction. I never had my induction at Future and it meant I didn't get the Future Fountain pen.
I never got one either. Maybe the induction's like fictional. No, there was a guy who, I did have an induction like talk where a guy said, I will never leave here and then he would play it off.
He said, I will never give you a fucking pen.
Okay, that's enough about that.
Anyway, enough about that. Anyway, this induction was actually the introduction to the game that I wanted because you're just walking through this museum, getting the history of this world from the perspective of these people. But the history is quite interesting.
Like what happened with the different factions, it foreshadows lots of stuff which is going to happen in their faction side quest. And in maybe like 10 minutes, 10 interesting little hooks that don't exist in the opening hours of The Constellation stuff, where I was like, oh yeah, yeah, I am interested in that. Like there's a mysterious vault that requires three things to open.
I was like, oh, I hope I get to open that vault with those three things. And I won't spoil if I did, but you know, that kind of stuff, there's a bit of like theatre to it that's missing from the opening of the game, you know, and it's something more tangible. Because the main quest line is a little bit 2001, it's a little bit sort of weird spaced magic stones.
Yeah.
And this I was like, oh, I get the stakes here, I'm like, I'm kind of in.
So the quest that you're referring to, I did that entire quest line and thought it was the main quest line because it drew my eye enough as a player to lead me to think that I was supposed to do this. And so it was only after I finished that quest line and got to the excellent conclusion of that quest line, which I think ties a bow on that history that you learn about that universe very nicely, Matthew, assuming you got to the end of the quest as I did.
I actually haven't finished it, no.
Undoubtedly, that quest line has some interesting choices along the way that relate to the history of the Starfield universe, right?
Right.
I assume you've seen enough of the game to know that. So yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's yeah. There's a lot, there's some good reveals in it.
Absolutely. I thought that was very strong. And then when it was over, I was like, oh yeah, they went to go find this piece of metal in some planet.
And I've completely forgot that that was actually the quest line. So I, you know, it sounds like you missed it the first time, but certainly for me, it felt like elegantly enough, it drew me into doing that as my kind of like proper intro to the game. So maybe that's why I feel like I've had such a good experience with it.
Because that was my runway, you know?
Yeah. And I hadn't, and that is what kept me playing in the second play. Like it instantly took me to like some much more interesting sci-fi.
And it's kind of, you know, I think we'll talk about this in the second section. It is quite interesting how different factions or different planets or cities kind of represent different bits of sort of sci-fi or different directions sci-fi can kind of go in. So the chances are there's probably something in here which will like scratch, scratch, you know, one of your sci-fi itches.
Yeah. And that storyline, you know, that isn't 2001. Like it's, I won't say what it relates to, but it's a lot more kind of actiony and weird than I was expecting from the off.
Yeah, it is with some nice secrets to uncover. So yeah, really strong. I think that is a good segue though, Matthew, to a question I did want to ask you, which is like, does this game have a good sci-fi universe?
And I think to give you kind of a bit of my take on this, I think in some ways you've alluded to it there, that Bethesda's universe's fallout obviously is not their universe. It was lifted from another developer, they've expanded it, but certainly Elder Scrolls. It feels like they build durable and accommodating universes more than extremely distinctive universes, i.e.
they are built to accommodate certain types of stories and quests. They need to have that kind of function in a way that maybe like another setting for a book or a film might not, because they draw the canvas so wide basically that anything can fit inside of it. And I think that you need to come to their fiction with that in mind, that it's built for that sort of thing.
But does that make it bad, or do you think that's a good approach to creating an RPG universe?
I think you're definitely right about its strengths as a foundation for video game questlines. It's not so outlandish that you can't have the mundane activities that you inevitably need to kind of pad something like this out. It does allow for the different factions, or like I said, different planets, to go in different directions and deal with different ideas.
I don't feel like any of it's too challenging, considering the opportunities that science fiction affords you in terms of you can go properly galaxy brained if you want. I've not seen anything where I've been like, oh wow, holy shit, that's such a cool idea, or like you've really moved the needle on this kind of discourse, or you basically have permission to create anything when you're dealing with this genre. And that obviously could be a very powerful tool in making some really like crazy quest lines.
And what I've seen, most of it wouldn't be out of place in Fallout and like Fallout's tech level. What a galactic scale gives you is the opportunity to build self-contained stories that are kind of just away from other civilisations. And I haven't really sensed them like exploiting that.
I've not gone anywhere. I've been like, what a crazy alien race, which have got a really distinct cultural problem, which makes me think all these interesting things. Everywhere I've gone, there are kind of humans with relatively human problems.
It's not like three-body problem or foundation. It's not like a galactic epic told over thousands of years. Though I should say, people do hint at New Game Plus being interesting in some, maybe, science fiction-y way.
Yeah, it does sound like there's something big there that's… I feel like I must be on the brink of getting to that now. So although I decided to go down another one of the faction questlines, because that tends to be where the best content is, to take me away from looking for those damn artefacts.
I am incredibly tempted to just… The temptation just to find out what the New Game Plus thing is, is very strong, because I know I won't be getting to it for quite a while. But also, if it's genuinely interesting, I don't want to see it.
I've seen people say it's like, near-automata levels of clever.
Yeah, do you think near-automata is the reason it has something like this? Do you think, because that game really does, it is big on recontextualizing things you've already experienced in a playthrough. But it's just crazy to think a game like that could influence a game like this.
But it doesn't seem plausible. My guess is it's got something to do with transporting you into the body of another person or something like that. And it's some kind of like, you die, but you also go on element.
That's kind of like my guess of what it is.
Right, but I sit here going like, oh, it doesn't have like the galactic scale of a three-body problem or foundation, but it might do. Like for all we know, the new game plus is like, it jumps forward a thousand years. And then you're like, what the fuck, and the whole thing's changed.
I don't think it will be that.
Too much work.
Too much work. But if that was the thing, I would be into that. I've got lots of versions of that game in my head and it'll inevitably be disappointing.
It'll just be like, holy shit, you've got an amazing hat. And you're like, oh, really? This is what everyone's excited about?
Sam Coe gives you his cool hat.
Yes, because he's already got an amazing hat. Yeah, so it's funny because I think that one thing that is fair to say about it, like you say, it's not even really as bold as something like Star Trek, which does have basically its version of race and religion based wars, right? Which, no offence to humanity, they will absolutely still be having when they're in space.
Like, they'll definitely be bickering about like shit that a dude said 2000 years ago. Like, that will definitely be happening in space. So there's a bit of that missing to it, where like the wildest thing you get really is like the snake worshipping sort of fashion, right?
And fucking space snake, it's all a bit space snake, isn't it? House Varun.
And then whatever the crimson, the crimson dudes are up to, they've got like their own thing as well. I've not really investigated them.
They're just like pirates, I think.
Yeah, I think they might have a quest line, maybe? I'm not sure, but I think there might be more to them to discover.
Oh yeah, I'm doing like all the faction quest lines, basically. Yeah, same. I'm basically like two quests deep into every faction.
Yeah, I am doing stuff with them, which is kind of interesting.
Well that I think actually speaks to another of the game's strengths, which is it's really good at signposting what the things that matter are, you know what I mean? Just like with icons or just it being obvious from the context how important the quest is versus, I don't know, a husband and wife had a bust up or whatever like on like A Killer City. You're like, well, I can skip that because I've got to go with, yeah, yeah.
Do you like the delivery system, the way it's plants the seeds of a lot of quests where if you walk past two NPCs discussing a mission, it adds it to like this vague activities log, which you then follow to get to the mission start. That activity log for me is so full of stuff and I'm like, what the fuck does any of this relate to? I don't know if I'm just missing the NPC dialogue, but it's like, the triggers are not clear to me.
And it inundates you with stuff as well.
I think the problem with that is it needs to try and fix your attention more when it happens. Because in a first person game where you can run around at all times, it's really easy to get out of earshot of what they're talking about because you're running around at open world trying to get to a place you want to go to. And so yeah, you might just catch like two words or maybe no words, it just appears.
So I do agree that maybe like it could use a button that's like focus and then you just focus on the conversation being had as you might have in some other kind of open world games. So yeah, I think I agree with that. But I do like the idea of it.
The idea that like your sort of like junkie tick them off and get some XP or credits quests are ambiently out there in the world for you to find. They are world building in themselves. That's a cool idea.
Plus, the fact is, like I actually think while I think there's some real problems with the inventory system in this game, it's chaos. You do not have enough like room for any of your stuff, like even really early on. It's actually quite distressing as a player if you're like, if you try and be organized about this.
The actual like the way that quests have their own drop down menus in the in the menu, that's excellent. I think it just means you can keep this laser focus despite the fact the scale of the game, you know, is so enormous. You could go in any direction and there'd be a million different things going on.
It's actually really good at keeping you focused in the midst of that. So that's one area where I think it really deserves praise. It has great main quests for you to do and like and faction quests, but it's also really easy to keep track of which one, which ones matter and which ones you're supposed to be doing.
So it's good game, Matthew. It's good. I'm enjoying it.
It's very enjoyable, I think, so far. Matthew, should we take a quick break and come back with some more in-depth thoughts about Starfield?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, we're talking about Starfield. That's what this podcast is about.
So we're gonna do more of that in section two, which in my document says more granular stuff. So Matthew, is there a particular highlight of what you've played so far at Starfield?
How spoilery can we be?
Well, we've tried to be relatively spoiler-free, so I think maybe give the shape of the thing that is your highlight without spoiling the full thing.
I've experienced a few, I'd say heavier action set pieces, which traditionally would absolutely flummox Bethesda's engine. There is stuff with something called the Terramorph, which actually your introduction to it, I thought was a, like a, not a, I'm not gonna oversell it and say it's like a horror set piece, but it was clearly kind of tapping into like aliens.
It's brilliant, brilliant quest.
That is something that would have really been beyond them before. Whenever those, their games try and do big set pieces, is where you just see so much of the jank colliding together. This just like behaved as it was meant to behave.
And that happening in a semi-open world, that's quite cool. Like I'm always impressed when games of this scale also focus on making something more granular in greater detail and kind of more exciting in a very specific moment. And I like it when you can do both of those things.
You got like both of those registers, I guess. And this definitely does that. Like it can do invasions and outbreaks and kind of chaos a lot better than they previously could.
So that's been cool.
Yeah, that mission, the first introduction to the pteromorph is like memorably good. And then I think there's a few missions along the way that use the pteromorph in similarly impressive ways. So yeah, that's super good.
I think that there was like a choice I made in the game so far that I won't spoil this along one of the quest lines we discussed that I thought was, oh, this is that it was the first time that I think that the story had really drawn me in where I've been like, oh, I actually understand what's going on and what the stakes are and what the ramifications are of doing this. And, you know, I could lie, I could tell the truth, I could extort people. And I was like, these are all the things that Bethesda RPGs can do really well at their best, like firing on all the cylinders.
And I've had a few moments like that, but there's one in particular that just really stood out. And I think there's bound to be more to come. One thing that actually has impressed me is that I've never really been...
So I've always thought that Bethesda's world building's great. Like they create these really nice, super well maps as we discussed, and make great use of the horizon line and give you these great varieties of locations. In Fallout, some of the places they would take you to, like the comic book shop in, or like that big boat in Boston, or like the Fenway Park, the baseball stadium, they've turned into a whole settlement in Fallout 4.
Like, they're really good at creating those individual locations. But one thing I thought they'd never really nailed until I played this was the idea of like a massive scale location. And there's a couple in this where I was like, you know what, these are really impressive as undertakings.
And maybe you couldn't fit all of these in like one open world. Maybe you couldn't walk from like, you know, neon to a killer city in the same place without it having some kind of loading screen. But just like the, as individual places, they are more spectacular, I think, in an almost like cyberpunk-esque way in terms of the scale, you know, maybe not in terms of like the visual fidelity, but certainly the scale, than they've previously been able to achieve.
So I think that actually like some of the world-builders has really impressed me. Have you been to the Red Mile, Matthew? Have you been to that place?
It doesn't ring a bell.
Yeah, you'd know it if you went there, but it's kind of like, without spoiling too much of it, it's got kind of like a sort of death sort of trap game show element where you basically have to run through this big environment of like nasty stuff and try and survive and then people at this bar will make bets on you surviving or not and you'll encounter loads of corpses along the way. Like it's a one, it feels like it's a one-off location, but it's really well rendered and really beautifully brought to life. And again, I was surprised because I kind of, I got used to the idea that you were just gonna see the same set of like gray or beige buildings on different planets.
And then when you do see something that's distinctive, you're like, oh wow, this is really cool actually. And there seems to be a lot of that in there. As an undertaking, it seems like they've built more stuff for this game than they've ever had to build before for a disaster RPG.
And that scale constantly impresses me.
Is it churlish though that when you go from those very bespoke places to what is clearly templated, like my heart does sink a little bit. And I get the scale of what they've had to build and the amount that they've had to build, but the game does contain both. And I do find it a little bit harder to be excited about the spaceship interiors.
You can just see the rooms or like the tiles that they've kind of built it all from. And that's a little bit Fallout 3, like being in the vaults again. And you're like, that feels quite old to me.
No, I agree.
But then like you can't make everything new. And I get that. And it's definitely stronger by pursuing the quest lines that take you to these interesting places.
And you can join this kind of corporation called Ryujin. I'd say it's like the cyberpunk. It's a bit like Arasaka type deal.
It's like this big, you know, comically evil sort of satirical version of a corporation where everyone's trying to like shit on each other. And it's quite obvious that all their corporates speak is sort of code for basically like murdering all their rivals and everything. It's a little bit on the nose, but you know, it takes place in this like gorgeous kind of office that's all sort of, you know, Oriental design and sort of Zen gardens and all this kind of stuff.
And I haven't seen, you know, I've only been to one place with all that. And that's really cool. It sells you on the promise that something interesting could be behind any door, whether or not it is, play it and see.
Yeah, I do agree that some of the more modular, generic locations make your heart sink a little bit when you land on a planet and that's all you see. I do agree with that. And I think that, yeah, like it's just the way the places are cluttered.
And I have very little patience now for picking through and finding bits and, you know, the little bits and pieces, carrying a fucking ashtray to go sell it to some Sunbell End on New Atlantis like that. I kind of agree with you on, you know.
The only clutter I'm interested in, and it's what keeps you looking at all the clutter, even though you don't want to engage with any of it, are like the permanent stat upgrade books. Yeah, like those are just like, those are gold. That's a permanent change to your character forever.
Of course, you're going to pick those up. There's enough of them that it has made me go, well, I better go and look from a stat comic in every single building. And you're just looking through and it looks quite a lot like there's an asset of like a notepad and there's an asset of a piece of paper with just some scribbles on it, which are very similar to it.
So you often have to really get up close and have a proper look. That's very annoying. They knew exactly what they were doing when they created those assets.
Yeah, that's true. That's true. So yeah, sort of like, yeah, I would say those locations aside then, like I think the spectacle of the universe is pretty amazing and like has constantly impressed me when I do go to these distinctive locations and I'm like, oh, there's even more stuff that I haven't seen yet.
And you know, I'm only 25 hours in, so there's more of that to be found, I would hope. I think there's like maybe one more city I've not seen as well. So excited to go out and find that.
I've been doing the three star collective faction and they're like the cowboys basically. They're quite like the, is it the Minutemen in Fallout 4?
Very much so, yeah.
They are like your space garbys for sure. And I think a lot of people are gonna gravitate into Waterloo because working with them pairs you up with a bloke who's voiced by him out of Deus Ex Human Revolution.
Elias Tufexis, Adam Jensen. You've got Cowboy Adam Jensen with you, which is funny.
It's like probably the easiest sell I've ever had for a companion in an RPG. It's like, what if Adam Jensen was a cowboy and he was your mate? Like, I'm sold, thank you.
So that's great. And also their quest lines kind of takes you to places where it's kind of like Wild West planets, but they're a little bit more lived in and some of them are like farms. So they've got like nice barns and lots of greenery.
And those are actually the only kind of like reasonably lush planets I've probably visited where a lot of it's been just like barren rock and very, very depressing. And I was like, oh, is this just like empty rock simulator? That's very much the sort of the vibe of like certainly essential quest lines so far.
Landing and seeing a farm with like all this life and greenery and color was probably...
Different enemies, you know?
Yeah, and like big weird aliens popped out of the ground and stuff and it gives you a sort of spark of hope that there are other weirder, more interesting things out there rather than just rock, rock, rock. And the flip side to that is I haven't yet discovered anything more interesting than that planet-wise.
Yeah, I'm willing to believe there are weirder things out there, but yeah, like you, that's probably the limits of the strange stuff I've seen so far. So yeah, in some ways as well, it feels like the color palette of Starfield imposes some limitations on how weird it can get. That's at least how it feels where I am now.
It's designed to be this, you know, expanse style, plausible, quote unquote, sci-fi setting, industrial setting. Like you say, the power level of Fallout weirdly makes sense here despite them not technically being the same fiction. So, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So it's interesting. So Matthew, I suppose that that is a good segue to talk about the weaker aspects of the game. Can I kick off with one?
Spaceship combat is, Oh my God. It makes such a bad first impression that, like I know there are skills that improve it. And I know that your first spaceship is particularly crap, but Star Fox, this ain't.
Thoughts on that one?
Oh, yeah, because you think it's going to have a little bit of like ship simulation. You control like the power that you put into engines and different weapons. In reality, what it actually is, is just shooting very long distance things in a tiny reticule and then slowly turning around and shooting them again.
I like whether I win or lose. I just haven't really worked out the logic behind those. Sometimes they've got the same level as me and I win.
Sometimes they've got the same level as me and I just get pummeled and lose.
Yeah, it's like I'm going to fly in a straight line and hope for the best. And that is every single encounter I've had in 25 hours, you know?
Part of their spiel is whatever sci-fi hero trope you want to be. It's in this game somehow. If there's any version of this which makes you feel like fucking Han Solo, I cannot imagine what you'd have to do to the ship upgrades for it to be much more fun than it is, which is not very fun at all.
To me, actually, the way space works, basically it's an instance of space in the outer atmosphere of a planet. So the planet's always in the background and then there are some things orbiting, and maybe some other ships. You're never just in the depths of empty space.
You're always tethered to a planet. That all just feels like a really weird mini game to me. It just doesn't feel like it has anywhere near the same depth or sophistication as what's going on in the planet with like your character build.
It's very undercooked.
Yeah, it's a weird one because the thing is, I think it highlights the other, the strangeness with the traveling between worlds more generally in this game, which is in a lot of cases, you never have to get inside your spaceship. You just bring up a fast travel menu. You navigate a whole bunch of menus.
Yeah.
You just get to your mission. You hit show location, then you set location where you want to travel. At most, normally, it will just take you straight there.
But at most, you might not have explored the route there. So you have to go to the orbit of a planet just to say you've been there, so you can then hyperdrive away to another place. It's a weird one because I think it highlights the weirdness of that decision, which I think actually does make sense.
There's no world in which I think they make you travel between worlds manually that people would like. It had to be this way. But I think it does also maybe cast questions about, well, was this the best game for you to make then?
Because you couldn't quite nail this spaceship side of things. And it's an interesting question, you know?
Probably my grandest thought on this, and I know it's awful when people who don't make games do this, like, well, why didn't you do this instead? Instead of like eight years of trying to solve problems, how do you generate the surface of a thousand planets? And how do we do space travel?
Why didn't they just do the bits which are quite like fallout, which we know that they could do? Why didn't they just do that in like half the time? And we could have enjoyed that, and then we could have enjoyed another game from them.
I feel like they've been toiling away, and all the stuff which is like very evolved or new, just doesn't do it for me. The planet stuff, the space stuff, everything else. They did a lot of their problem solving in those earlier games, because it's so close, you can see so much of those games in them.
That's got a huge guy outside of games going, why don't you just cut out the space and do it in four years? Which is very much what our next episode is going to be about, like shitting on idiots like me. But a little bit of my brain does think that.
We could have had this a while back, and then we could have had Elder Scrolls now. I just don't know what the game was. The ambition of this has pushed it in a direction I don't really care for.
Yeah, so it's a weird one, because I think they just felt like they needed to give you the scale and that was one of the USPs of the game. But so far, actually, one thing I think it gives the game in terms of world building is, you can have a place that culturally feels extremely different to another place, and it had to be more plausible than like it's a 10-minute walk away, just go over there, do you know what I mean?
Yeah, I just don't know why they didn't, they could have done that in like Mass Effect. Yeah, Mass Effect does that.
It's true.
And you just jump around a star map and that would have been fine. Or like, don't give us the whole planets, give us like the main city and then a smaller wasteland style thing around it. Or again, like absolute guy who doesn't know what he's talking about.
That is mostly what they do though, they don't give you the entire world, they give you like a patch of the world to explore.
Yeah, and that's what you need though. That's where all the good stuff lives is in that patch. So why do you need all the other patches where there's fuck all?
Yeah, it's an interesting question because yeah, Mass Effect does like, you know, it gives you the feeling that you're going around a galaxy, but it's 25 hours long, you know, so. Yeah, it's true that they're, you know, and, you know, maybe it's time to bring back planet scanning, Matthew. A bit of that, basically.
It has got a bit of planet scanning because you can work out like, oh, I'm going to build an outpost here and like, drill into the rock to pull out this particular element. What are you going to do with that element? I'm going to build another outpost.
And then what? I don't know, drill for more elements and build more outposts. Where does the outpost game go?
What the fuck is that about? I just don't get it.
Am I just trying to be BP in the universe of fucking Starfield?
Basically, congratulations, you've fraxed this virtual universe. Like achievement unlocked, I guess.
Well, the good thing is as well, I think you can give that stuff a miss and then just focus on the main quest stuff, which is what I've been doing and that's okay. But yeah, it is interesting just how much game there is in this and how much game is arguably unnecessary in the midst of that. Well, all I can say is that, like you said earlier, Matthew, there is a stickiness to these games.
People will play them over and over again. People will invest years in them. I can see a world where people do get drawn into that stuff and it is interesting to them.
Someone on Twitter messaged me saying, I've made a storage system where you can put an item in a crate and my automatic crate system will sort it into the box where that type of item is kept. He said, it took me six hours to build. I was like, right, we are completely different types of player.
And it's good that the game could accommodate your way of playing. But also, I'm happy with the top line. Let's go on some space adventures with Adam Jensen and the cowboy hat side of things.
So yeah, it's a weird one.
And the other thing which is a little bit unfair about the criticism about the exploration and how it just feels like endless fast travel is that if this game was true exploration, if you could fly from the planet surface up into space between planets, you would inevitably just end up doing the fast travel system which this game is and be like, oh fuck all that, after like an hour or so. But just because it isn't there, you're like very lazy.
Yeah, like I said, I think they have what they've given people is the best way to circumnavigate what they've built. Like I think that's...
Oh yeah, it's almost like they made a bigger game and then like over time they're like, well this is the optimal way of getting around it and this is probably what people will want. And it is what you'd want, but just because it's the only option, you're like, well, it's not really proper space travel, is it? Because it's just a load of quick loading.
It's like, well, that's all I would be doing if you actually... But when I play No Man's Sky, I'm like, I wish I could just fast travel everywhere instantly.
Well, that's it. Like that's the thing. It's not trying to be a space simulation game.
Space simulation game is offering something very particular and achieve those things on their own particular terms. This is not trying to be that. And I think it's better for it for the type of game that it is at its core, which is an RPG where you go up to slightly odd NPCs and talk to them about stuff.
And that's fine. So, yeah, that's a different weaker element because as well like they've gated some of the more interesting space combat stuff behind leveling up and stuff like that. And it's sort of like, you know what?
If this game, if you just had a barrel roll at the start, it would be so much better. It just would be like some method to dodge. It's like I said, I'm just going in a straight line and hoping I don't get shot down before they do.
It's not the one dog. So that misfires slightly. Anything else Matthew you think is a weaker aspect?
I actually like, I will say highlights, combat is good in this, like you say. I just did like one of those space stations that's like completely anti-grav and just shot loads of dudes in anti-grav, just sort of like jetting around in with my little backpack. I had a great time.
But yeah, on the witnesses side, what do you think?
Quite bad inventory. My big problem with inventory is actually looting because you don't know what anything is until you've picked it up. It just gives you the name.
It doesn't go like this is a gun. And I'm looking at these people going, am I picking up a backpack, a gun? What the fuck am I actually picking up?
Unless I'm missing something super obvious, I find that quite confusing. So now I just don't, I only pick up credits, ammo and digipix. Anything else is just a risk.
I'm going to be carrying something heavy that I'm going to drop at some point. Loads of people have said that though. The fact that there isn't a proper map system on the planets, that's a super boring but obvious one.
I find that you have like this scanning visor which can like map a kind of GPS style route on the floor. But I actually find it quite hit and miss as to whether it actually activates. Like the system itself doesn't know where I am.
So it's just like, eh, I guess you're going to have to figure out for yourself. Maybe you've played more of the main quest side, but what I've played of that has been pretty shit so far. Like I don't find the go around collecting magic stones and the magic stones give you like magic powers.
It's kind of like Skyrim's Dragon cries. Like they're very hooked on this. The main quest line is collecting a load of stuff around that isn't my favorite mode.
I'd much rather something a bit more kind of focused and driven.
That's fair. I got, I don't again, don't know if I'm on the main quest or not. I don't think I am at the moment.
Someone tipped me off that. Is it the, uh, the Cowboys? Are they called the free, free something Rangers?
Something like that.
The Free Star Collective.
Right, that's who they are. Is that okay? I cannot remember these names, so it's just, it's tough.
So yeah, that I got tipped off. That quest may or may not lead you to quite a nice spaceship. So that's the reason I'm kind of like doing that, that line at the moment, which kind of attracts when you know what the subject of the quest is and what I think at the start.
So that's good. So again, I think I've accidentally wandered off of the main path again. So yeah, I mean, it certainly hasn't gripped me enough to stick with it.
Have you done the Mantis quest line?
No, I don't think so. What does that involve mostly?
From relatively early on, you'll pick up a note on the body of random spaces saying, everyone get to this planet, there's something cool there. And then you go there and there's something cool there.
Oh, no, I've not done that. That sounds, that sounds rad though.
It's the absolute classic Bethesda quest line in terms of a little story, self-containing one, gives you some really good loot, the environmental storytelling of this thing. It's very like pop culture friendly. I won't say what element of pop culture it taps into, because I think they'll give the game away.
But it feels like the kind of descendant of some quest lines that we've done before in Fallout that I know that you're fond of.
So oh, OK, I think I can work out what you're alluding to there.
It's a little bit mysterious. It's a little bit goofy, and then you get something quite cool at the end of it.
OK, cool. I will say as well, by the way, to listeners, there is a fucking annoying alarm going off in the background of my recording. So if you can hear a noise, you're not going completely mad.
There is a sound that my microphone is picking up.
Don't worry, I will cut around all of your talking.
Oh my god, what an absolute nightmare that would be. Patreon doesn't pay enough for that, do you?
I have had to do that with so many of our interviewers' bad mics. If they're not talking, their audio has basically been cut.
I'm not capable of doing such things, because I don't understand how audio editing works. Mine are always much more in the middle of the tree.
I really don't either. I just know that I've got to get rid of that noise.
Well, I look forward to finding those quests, Matthew. I will say that there's just so many good breadcrumb trails they've given me so far. I completed one quest line and I've ended with a character basically just giving me targets to go and assassinate, which I thought was quite cool, and then just bring back the evidence and get some money.
That was neat.
Yeah, yeah. I think I've done that one.
Okay, so yeah, you have done the same bit I was alluding to earlier. So yeah, okay. This is a good game.
I'm having a really good time. I think it's amazing how more-ish it is considering that I really did think from that first hour that this is going to be hard work to do an episode about this. I thought, oh no, have they made a cell phone universe too dry that I'm not really drawn into?
But I don't know. It's definitely won me over. So Matthew, I was curious how you feel about, shall we talk a bit more about the settlements, Matthew?
Is there anything you want to ask me about those?
Yeah, well, I was going to ask if you've been to Paradiso?
No, I don't think so.
Where this game does occasionally do the fallout thing of like, you walk over a hill and then there's a weird looking building, is you land on something and you're like, okay, what the hell is this place still? You know?
Yeah.
Because you get like a nice little animation of your ship landing and you can see some stuff and a trope I quite like in any game really. Not just open world games, it's like functioning tourist resort. Like, I like places where you can just go and have a pretend holiday and then also get up to some mischief in them.
That's a big Hitman trope I really like. And fallout kind of does it occasionally where it's sort of like, you'll happen a place where they're like desperately trying to hold on to some semblance of the old world or civility and it's kind of cute and kind of funny. And when you do spend a lot of time landing on just empty rocks with the occasional cloned base, landing on a place and seeing something like quite grand and spectacular looking, the game does have a couple of those wow moments.
Oh yeah, absolutely does.
I do like Neon the Cyberpunk City. When you go there, you're actually like, oh, this is, there's a huge art lift on this game.
Yeah, there's something here that I've not seen in other Bethesda RPGs until in terms of the effort and like the undertaking. Yeah. Yeah, really impressive.
And there's some, also like the culture in Neon is completely different to other places as well. It's more of a like lawless kind of city. I've been a bit like, what's that place in Mass Effect 2?
Omega. It's a bit like that, right? It's like the Omega of Starfield.
So yeah, you know, Mass Effect is definitely like, if you enjoy Mass Effect, there's definitely some of the same DNA here in terms of how they build universes out of like, you know, sci-fi imagery or tropes, I guess. So definitely like a similar sort of thing.
Here's a quick question for you. I don't know if you get this, but I always get this in Bethesda games. What's the prop of this game?
What's the bit of clutter that you see the most or sticks with you the most? What's the thing where you're like, oh, that fucking thing. Like, it always happens in these games.
Like, you know, I can't remember which Fallout it was, which had a big crafting. I think maybe Fallout had the crafting system and I was always searching for electronic fans or little stove heaters.
Right.
My mind was just like mega tuned into those. But I'm just curious if there's any of the, from your limited hours with the game, if you can predict what's the standout? What's the MVP clutter of Starfield?
The thing is, it's quite hard to discern because early on, I didn't realize that you had an inventory in your ship and I just dumped loads of shit on the floor of my spaceship. And then realized that for some reason, your in-ship inventory is extremely limited, then I had to do the same thing again. So there's still loads of shit on the floor of my ship.
I eventually bought a little house in the killer and just dumped all my shit there instead. So I can go back there later. So there's a lot of like vague rocks and stuff like that.
Right. The thing I keep noticing the most weirdly is like that, is that fucking like metal girder thing that's like three bits of metal stuck together and it weighs like two. So it takes up loads of your inventory.
Do you know the thing I mean? It's not visually distinctive really, but you see it in the environment and oh great, another fucking one of these I don't know how to use. Or like milk.
I find milk sometimes.
Something called chunks.
Yeah, that's a good one. Chunks because they're just like vague matter like balls.
The name is enough as well that every time you're like, oh it's chunks again.
Also DigiPix, which I've accidentally sold many times because they're in the fucking miscellaneous menu and not in another menu.
Right, I didn't know what they were. That's an absolute classic. The first time I played Fallout 3, I didn't realize or I didn't make the connection between physical bottle caps and caps being the currency.
So like if you went into a place and there are a load of bottle caps on a table, I'd be like, well I'm not picking those up. What the fuck would I want out of the bottle caps? And it's only like hours later, you're like, oh, the untold riches I've thrown away.
This one here, I was very quick to be like, what does the lockpick look like? What does money look like in this world? Because I don't want to make that mistake.
I think for me it's chunks, the Terra Brew coffee cups. They're fucking everywhere. And they're in places where like the story's like, no one's been here for a thousand years or whatever.
And you're like, yeah, apart from some fucking guy drinking Terra Brew. So, you know, it's probably that. The other one is how many fucking Dickens books there are.
Because I guess it's like license free to print. It's like out of copyright now. So you can print, you can pick up Dickens.
But if you go to your, I went to, I've got the perk where I have parents.
And I can go to their- Yeah, me too, best perk in the game.
I can go to their house with my old bedroom in it. And if you look at the bookshelves, the bookshelves in my bedrooms, he's got like four copies of Oliver Twist and like three copies of Great Expectations. And it's just, it just paints me as a total maniac.
That's very odd. Someone didn't think, is it weird if there's more than one Oliver Twist? They should have pro, there should be some kind of like, if room has Oliver Twist, do not spawn second Oliver Twist.
Again, Matthew, you're telling the programmers what to do there, but I think you might be right on this one.
Let's just code that in, and save yourself the humiliation of a bookshelf that only consists of Oliver Twist.
I'll tell you what, actually, this does remind me of the funniest thing that's happened in this game, and I laughed out loud at this. So there is obviously a bounty system in this, but the bounty works per faction. So there are different worlds under the jurisdiction of different factions.
And I think that maybe as Freestyle Collective, I went to, I had like a 77 bounty, and what happens is when you go to a planet that's occupied by that faction, and you try and land, they'll scan your ship for contraband items that you've stolen, very similar to how stolen items work in previous Bethesda RPGs, where it comes up as red, and you basically have to be hidden to like steal the item without there being consequences. And I had to pay a 77 credits fine, and the only two contraband items they took off of me was a chicken masala and the count of Monte Cristo. I was absolutely cracked up at the idea of these being my contraband items.
Like the idea that we scanned your spaceship and you need to return this curry and this book.
I'd do it at Space Judge, would be like reading out a list of evidence, and they're like, evidence A, chicken masala, evidence B, a copy of count of Monte Cristo's stained voice said chicken masala.
Also the idea that we're going to return this masala to its rightful owner.
Yeah, who lives in another star system. And he's like, where's my chicken masala? Wow, I never thought I was going to get that back.
What a pleasant surprise.
So that made me laugh so much. That's like the kind of weird systems of Bethesda at work there. Just the strangeness of those systems being thrown together.
And I found it very charming, really. But yeah, that's good.
The ship that scanned you as well was just like... And they see the X-ray of your ship. And somewhere there's a tiny...
And someone's like, wait, I think that's a chicken masala.
And he's just left it on the floor of his spaceship. The fucking maniac next to the Count of Monte Cristo. Yeah, okay.
So I wish I had a better answer to your question about, what is the MVP object?
Sometimes these things, they take a while to emerge. I'm still in the early days of reading a room's worth of clutter and getting a feel for it. Have you got a house?
I've got two now. I bought the cheap one in the well on New Atlantis. I don't know why I did that, because I hate New Atlantis and don't like going there.
And I bought the larger building in Akila City. So you get like a big room basically. And that room just has loads of stuff on the floor, as explained.
So how about you?
I did a perk where I started with a house.
Oh, that's a nice idea.
One of the things you pick at the start. So I've had this house, except the first quest line is pay it off. It's like instantly a burden.
Oh, it tells you that, doesn't it? In the perk menu.
It does say it, but you find out you've got this house and you go to a bank. You either pay for it all at once, or you're foreclosed on the property. And you're like, I haven't even been there yet.
I haven't been to this house that you're threatening to take away from me. So that was a bit bleak. And then when I went there, I realized it's a huge mansion, but it's absolutely empty.
And so begins the kind of like furniture crafting side of the game. It's basically tricking you into being interested in the kind of crafting, which I'm not going to collect resources to fill that house. So it's just it's forever empty apart from like it's got one sleeping bag on the floor.
And that's like it.
I think it serves you right for picking the Tom Nook fucking perk, Matthew. That's like on you, I think, you know.
You get a house in Tears of the Kingdom that you get to like build and like kit out. And I have such fondness for that that I was like, oh, I'm going to like, I wonder if it will be like Tears of the Kingdom. And actually, it's just it's just a very lonely place.
I don't know how it will ever like not feel lonely. But unless I can, I don't think you can invite companions to like live there. I don't know.
Maybe if you romance them, they move in or something. But it's got like, you know, five bedrooms. I'm like, who's ever going to what's going to fill this place?
Yeah, that is a bit weird, actually. I did what I did when I bought my second home in this game. I was there thinking, why is it compelling to own a property in this game?
None of it is my property. It's all a computer game. I could just ditch stuff in the headquarters of what they call the constellation.
It might as well be the same experience as having my own home, but for some reason it's always compelling, isn't it, to have a little house in a game?
Oh yeah, it's just like going to a spa in a game. It's like going to a tourist place. There's something thrilling about something as mundane, well, not mundane, as fantastical as owning property.
Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, I don't know. All these little bits and pieces, though.
Again, like you say, there's a lot of hints at wider systems you may not be interested in, but this game is pretty good at protecting you from stuff you might not care about. But there is an element of that where I'm like, all you have to do is give the wrong person the wrong tutorial for a system they want nothing to do with. Like that guy who was making factorio style fucking automated interfaces for ditching your shit.
I'm never going to do any of that stuff. Though shout out to that guy. I appreciate the insight and the pictures of many different containers.
But yeah, it's just that it's good at giving you the top line experience if you want it. And I do want the top line experience basically. I want to see all the good quests.
I want to hoover that up. I want to see all the good worlds. And that will do me.
I don't need to spend 400 hours in this game. I want to spend 100 very good hours in this game and then I'll move on with my life. I don't know what you think of that Matthew.
Yeah, I'm fully on board. Make it 50 hours.
It's not going to be 50 hours based on where I am now. I feel like I'm nowhere near getting on top of this game. In fact, I feel like I've let the listeners down.
I was aiming for like 40 hours before this, but unfortunately I had to go away for a week so I couldn't quite fit it in. But hopefully this will still be insightful for people. There was one crude question I wanted to ask you Matthew.
How do you think this compares to Baldur's Gate 3 for you? Since everyone's pitting them against each other, they were not supposed to be released in the same year. This game was meant to come out a year ago.
But is that a relevant comparison do you think?
No, not really. If what I like about Starfield is if you cleave away 99% of the galaxy, what's left I quite like, Baldur's Gate doesn't even pretend to engage with all that 99%. It's purely, everything in there is just, I mean in the crudest way possible, it's just written content.
Like everything in there is something specifically interesting. So everything in Baldur's Gate 3 is interesting to me. I think where Baldur's Gate has really broken these games for me, and where I probably wouldn't have had as much of a, not a problem, but just a sort of shrug, is the reactivity of the game to the specific character, both the character you build and the things they've done in that world.
Like when this occasionally throws you a bone and lets you use your background to say one thing, that maybe happens like once an hour for me in this game. It just feels like such a rudimentary version of what Baldur's Gate is just constantly reinforcing who you are. And that's fine, because that's what they've dedicated a huge amount of time and money to doing.
They're like, this really matters. And this game doesn't. It's so basic.
I almost don't care. I almost wonder why you even bother. If every once in a while I can say something diplomatic to hear a slightly different variation on the line.
Like I say, not a problem, but definitely something that jumps out in the wake of Baldur's Gate. But mechanically, they're so different. One's a real time trigger on the finger, first person shooter.
It's very, very hard to compare. But that's fine. I mean, that shows the RPG to be in rude health, I guess.
That it can have these two very different things in them and then be equally enjoyed. It's kind of dumb to pit them against each other. Although I did laugh a little bit about one of the Xbox leaks was a slightly dismissive email about Baldur's Gate.
Did you see that?
It's just the thing about how much it would cost to get on Game Pass.
The phrase was like, it's like some sort of second-rate stadia RPG thing. Oh dear. And it was just like low interest for Game Pass.
Where now, like they're bending over backwards and changing their entire Series X, Series S development policy to enable it to be on their platform. It's just, you know.
That's funny because that like raises questions about did they understand what Divinity Original Sin 2 was and the landscape of games.
But it's just, you know, it's the power of hindsight and, you know. Yeah. But Larry and very graciously have seen some of their people tonight going, well, everyone underestimated this and that's okay.
Like we believed in it.
I would feel that way too if I was rich as fuck, Matthew.
Yeah, like I'd be magnanimous as hell.
Yeah. This is a ridiculous year, isn't it? And I was curious, Matthew, after playing this, do you think you'll see it through?
And do you think it will trouble your Game of the Year list?
It's quite low priority for me of stuff to finish. I've definitely enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I was going to. But it's an abnormally strong year.
Will it make the top 10? I'm not sure. I don't think it would be too contrary if it didn't, given what else is currently on my list.
But I still need to finish Bordersgate 3. I still need to finish Tears of the Kingdom. I still need to finish Shadow Gambit.
I've played some like all timers this year for me, and still need to finish those. So the idea that I could prioritize this before them is kind of unlikely.
Yeah.
I don't know. It'll probably be in the conversation.
Yeah, I think it's sort of like it's, I think it's got a shot for sure. But it's actually like, I've got three games I know are going on there, and then the rest is like a big toss up. I think the good thing that's happened is that many of these games have come out earlier than they normally do.
So there's actually a good run up to the end of the year to prep a good list, you know? So there's a bit of time to get through it. That said, there is also a Spider-Man game coming out in like a month.
And like among many other things coming out in October. And yeah, a few things after that as well. So yeah, it's truly, it is the biggest year in memory really, isn't it?
I think it will probably end up going down in history this year as like one of those 2015 sized years or 1998 sized years, you know what I mean? Just like so much to like love from this year on the game side. So yeah, but I think I will see it through.
Like I really, I'm definitely going to see it minimum to the end of those faction side quests. Want to see what this New Game Plus thing is of course. Determined to see that before some idiot spores it on social media.
So yeah, that's, it's been a very good time. I went in with moderate expectations and I think this is actually a very good version of something that's comfortingly familiar.
So yeah, that's what I was going for. And I said, I thought it might appeal to your nostalgia is the comfort, the familiarity of it.
Yeah, for sure. But do you know what? I really do.
If like they could just, if the next game they made just didn't look or sound or feel as much like a Bethesda RPG in those very basic obvious ways that it does, that might actually be a good thing. Just to like, to reset your brain a bit. So you're not going into it with the Bethesda of it all as your prism for experiencing the entire game.
Do you know what I mean? Like that's, that really is a factor here. If presentationally it was completely different, if NPCs didn't behave the same way.
Now, you could argue that Bethesda, the way they make games, the reason that this game can have such amazing scale is because they have all those fundamentals in place and they don't need to build new things. And they can just layer new things on top of what they already have. So I kind of get that.
But also, I think that it might critically reset how they're perceived as well. If people aren't just like, there's the Bethesda NPC doing their Bethesda NPC thing. You know what I mean?
Like, and I'm having a conversation with a blank space on the screen again. And, you know, like just I'm doing the slightly odd kind of like persuade minigame. Just if they'd have like, if they change that, change the fundamentals of that bit, it might not be the worst thing for Elder Scrolls.
It's just not going to be that though, you know. You know, it is going to be Elder Scrolls. So it's already has the comfort and the familiarity of that, plus the comfort and familiarity of their engine.
I could see it being like just this, except sometimes there's a person with a cat's face.
Well, this does also, this does also suggest like they could, you know, based on like the locations they take you to here, obviously an Elder Scrolls game will be one continuous space. So they could really do some amazing things with that space. This game definitely like, to make you think about again, games that are eight years away, it does definitely create that impression of like, what could that look like in your head?
And it will probably be really impressive. But yeah, it's just like people's first touch point with this kind of game for many people was Oblivion. It was almost two decades ago.
And at that point, they didn't have any of this baggage and it all felt fresh and exciting. And I think that this game is fresh and exciting in many ways, but I think next time if they do just want to reset expectations a bit presentationally, it might just be worth doing something a bit different. I don't think they will, like you say.
I think they have what they have and it works obviously incredibly well. But I just personally wish it could just change it up slightly more in the meat and potatoes of it, you know? Okay, any further thoughts Matthew?
Or should we wrap it up there?
That feels good.
That's good.
We're all underpowered indeed.
That's my fault really. I should have sensed that things were winding up.
I should really say something spectacularly interesting. Oh, here's a thing for you. Another Xbox leak, rumoured Oblivion redo, remaster, remake.
Yeah, one for Fallout 3 as well.
Does that speak to you?
I suppose it can't hurt, you know what I mean? That's kind of how I feel about it really. Again, I don't know how much they'll really change of it.
I guess they would have to just overhaul the visuals.
I'm not sure if you can remaster Fallout 3 better than whatever 4K magic the Xbox back and pack tainted.
Yeah, that's true because it did look pretty nice after that. I'll be curious to see the results. It'll all be on Game Pass, won't it?
I don't have to do anything. It'll just be there.
May as well.
Oh, there it is. There's Lies of P. I guess I'll play that.
You won't play Lies of P. People say it's a bit like Sekiro, so there's a very vague chance I might play it. But this year, knowing it won't get near the top 10, I've really just got to get on and finish Final Fantasy 16 instead.
So, yeah, on it goes, Matthew. So, as Matthew sort of alluded to, we have quite an exciting episode coming up next week. It's Things You Only Understand If You Make Games with Jamie Smith, who is principal designer at People Can Fly.
So, a listener to the podcast kind of knows what we're about and has made so many notes in his document for the episode that me and Matthew are a little bit intimidated going into the recording. But, also, we're going to talk about things we've never talked about in this podcast before, from someone who's a genuine authority, who's worked on everything from Driver San Francisco to Call of Duty Vanguard and, like, tons of other games in between, The Division. There's going to be lots to talk about.
So, I'm excited about that one, Matthew. That episode plan, when you saw all the notes, you must have got pretty excited about it.
Yeah, absolutely. It's really thorough and I was like, that's going to be a fun ride. And also, like, good to puncture idiots like me who think they know what's going on.
Yeah, and Jamie just pitched it to us as well. So, I don't know how many game dev sort of, like, listeners we have. I have no idea really, but, you know, if you ever did want to sort of, like, suggest an episode idea to us and you have, like, an angle or some experience you think might be relevant to our listeners, then backpagegames.gmail.com if you want to send along sort of any kind of ideas.
But, obviously, no pressure. It's just if you have something you think might be good, we'll definitely hear you out for sure. So, yeah, looking forward to that one, Matthew.
And there is, we have released this month already our XL episode, which is two giant men solve an escape room in the best game in prisons. An episode that went down incredibly well, despite me being really nervous, it's going to be total dog shit going into it. And that was good, Matthew.
And you've got me to read the book Audition for the XXL episode this month, is that right?
Yeah, have you read it yet?
No, I've got like eight days or something, so I better get on that. Yeah, but it should be good, not very long, and Matthew's going to talk about some Asian crime fiction, should be a good listen. All right then, that's the podcast done, Matthew.
Where can people find you on social media?
In space! Oh god, that was weak.
I laugh, I laugh politely. Yeah.
I'm going to edit that out.
No, don't, you've got to keep it now.
At fucking space. That's how I'm just tired.
No, you've got to keep that in the pod. You have to keep that in the pod now.
Twitter at... People don't know how fucking dumb I am. Twitter at MrBazzle underscore pesto if Twitter still exists.
Yep, I'm Samuel W Roberts on Twitter and also on Blue Sky as well. There is Samuel W Roberts on Blue Sky but also Back Page: Pod on Twitter but also Back Page: Pod on Blue Sky. You can catch us on both.
You can't upload video clips to Blue Sky which is really annoying but I will post otherwise other bits and pieces that come in there so you can have updates of the podcast and keep in touch with us. Matthew, let's get out of here.
Let's do it.
See you later. Bye. In space.
