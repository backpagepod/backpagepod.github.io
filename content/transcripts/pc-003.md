Hey, hello everybody. Welcome back to another edition of The Back Page Podcast, AKA PC Gaming Classics. My name is Phil Ivanyuk, and with me is the Alex Turner of British Games Journalism.
It's Jeremy Peel. Hello, Jeremy.
Hey, hello.
Hi, it's weird to sort of do that when we've been talking for upwards of 20 minutes already, isn't it?
It is, you've immediately reminded me that me and my partner once heard Alex Turner on Radio One refer to Sheffield as Sheffield. We say that to each other often. We both live in Sheffield, so...
Yeah, important bit of context there.
Yeah, we get a lot of use out of that.
I think they're from High Green, aren't they, the Arctic Monkeys? High Green, baby! That's what it says.
I should know, I should know where that is.
Yeah, well, my Sheffield not this. I know from Jeremy that there's an absolutely lovely place for brunch quite near where you live, Jeremy, isn't there, but... Yeah.
That's not really why we're here.
I mean, this is a Back Page spin-off. Like it is all about eateries local to the places where the hosts live.
Well, actually, we'll be getting onto that. I've got a little tidbit of info that's exactly along those lines. So that's very exciting that you've sort of formalized that as a segment in this podcast.
But officially, this is all about the 1997 RPG Fallout by Interplay, which we have been reminiscing about, ruminating on, replaying on PCs old and new and very excited to get into it, but let's just catch up for a minute. So the last podcast we dropped was was Blade Runner. That was just before Christmas.
Firstly, Jeremy, did you have a nice Christmas and new year? And if so, what was it like?
I did. It was nice.
Good.
I'm trying to think.
Illuminating.
Whether it played anything interesting over that time. Not particularly. It was a good time.
And yeah, it was nice. How was yours?
Good. Well, I feel like I was there. I feel like I was there with you.
I play Layers of Fear, for some reason. Oh, I'll tell you what it was. Cause I went over to my parents' place for Christmas and I obviously didn't bring a massive gaming PC with me.
I brought my work MacBook. So I was limited to games that work on a Mac on Steam. And I think constraints are always great, right?
Like everyone's Steam library is too big. And it was great to just have a lot of the decisions made for me. So Layers of Fear popped up.
Enjoyed that. Not very congruous with Merriment and Jolliness and Port and Cadbury's Roses and other things that are Christmasy in my household. But it was good and a bit Dawn of War 3 as well.
Lovely. Oh, I'll tell you what I did. I figured out that Fallout New Vegas would run on my work laptop.
And this is what I do. I tend to get carried away. I got back into Fallout and then I'll play at least two Fallouts at once.
Gosh, that is quite an undertaking. I've been playing more recently in the New Year. I've been playing Elden Ring alongside Fallout.
And I mean, you'll understand why that is an absolute nightmare, but we'll get into it. But suffice to say, I'm just gagging for some quest markers and things. Like it's all very, you know, careful what you wish for, isn't it?
For years, we've been saying, we want completely player-directed worlds, but no, I want a quest marker and a compass and a really well-kept diary and a quest log. They're just like, listen, mate, go here. There's a knife.
Pick up the knife, go back to this bloke. He's exactly there in this tavern and you'll get a load of XP. That's what I want now.
I was gonna say, I don't see you sticking with Elden Ring. I don't see me sticking with it at any point, but especially not you.
I get very pigheaded about it though. Like I tend to stick with the games I'm not enjoying as much because with the games that I really love, I like to save them for a special treat. Give like, oh, I'm really enjoying this.
Is my life perfect in every way? If no, then let's shelve it until it is. Whereas if it's Elden Ring, it's like, fuck this game.
I'm going to beat it. I don't care if I'm enjoying it or not. I just want it done.
And I like completely devalue it and show it no respect and like try and choose it in any way possible. And then it's done and I've won.
You like to match the mood of your life at that time. So basically, if you're not having a good time, you need a sort of flaying from your video games at that moment is what I'm guessing.
Yeah, it doesn't have to be difficult. It just doesn't, it just can't be brilliant. The brilliant games are only for when you have like time off work, your house is immaculate, everything's going well in your personal life, great food shopping, you're cooking a lovely meal later on in the day and only then are you allowed to play the games that you like.
I don't know if anyone else looks like that.
I've been doing this wrong.
Also, this is why I like a lot of my favorite games. This is why it's good that we're doing this podcast because a lot of my favorite games that I sort of hold up there as being, you know, in my personal Mount Rushmore, I've only played it once because I just never, like, I never deem it the appropriate time to go back in case I wear out the magic, you know? So, and I guess Fallout is one of those games.
So it's good that we're doing this. Before we get into talking about Fallout itself though, I wanted to share you, share with you this anecdote, Jeremy. It's a wonderful anecdote.
And it goes a bit like this. Just before Christmas, I went into Itsu in Bath and I saw none other than Matthew Castle.
Matthew Castle. That's a familiar name.
Matthew Castle, star of The Back Page podcast. And he looked startled. And then I think realized who I was.
If not, was very good at vamping. Just smoothing his way through an encounter with somebody who was accosting him in a sushi place.
I think he, I'm sure he must have known who you were. Cause I don't think Matthew, I can't imagine Matthew just kind of bluffing his way. I don't think he'd be afraid to say, I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are.
To be fair, we did talk about the podcast. And if he hadn't have got it by then, then that must have clicked. And also just hearing the voice, you know?
You both close your eyes and listen to each other and place the voices.
That would do it.
Can we get the whole picture? What is itsu? Is that a chain?
I don't know.
It is a chain. Yeah, yeah. They do, they do pretty affordable sushi and their thing, their whole thing, is that you can order on a big tablet like in McDonald's.
That's it.
Right. So pretty, how good is the sushi, would you say?
Seven out of 10, six or seven, I don't know.
So that was the kind of day you were having, right? This is what we're gathering. You were having a reasonable day when you're like, I can't treat myself.
I think most of my days are like a six or a seven. Yeah.
Sure. Yeah.
So I wasn't going to go down patisserie Valerie and just go weapons-free on all the pastries. It was just like a functional, get some carbs and protein and reasonably fresh things in and get on with my day. And I think Matthew was having a similar day.
So our paths intercross there and that was a real thrill. So that's my anecdote for the episode.
That's lovely. What did he say about the podcast?
Oh, well, he said he liked it and I believed him. So that was good, I was greatly heartened by those words.
That's a relief.
So I think that's it. I think that's us caught up really. That's everything that's happened in our lives in the last month since we played Blade Runner and talked about it on the last episode.
You can listen to that one if you're... How would they listen to that one, Jeremy? You would need to be a Patreon.
Yeah, you wanna go to patreon.com forward slash back page pod. I'm gonna check if that's correct now. I am in fact a Patreon.
While Jeremy does that, I'll just remind you that we also have episode one, which was System Shock 2. So those two, you could binge on us if you wanted to. I don't have quite the same depth of anecdotes in all the other episodes, but you don't run into Matthew Castle every day.
So that's only fair.
I'm pleased to announce I've got the URL right. And that's where you want to go if you want to wait. I've just realized that anyone listening to this knows that they've already done that.
That's right.
That's right, isn't it? Yeah, because how else are we going to be getting this one? So I suppose what we're saying is just a reminder that the previous two podcasts, which you've definitely listened to because you've already sort of paid for them, they still exist.
So why not go back and listen to them all again?
Yeah. Eventually we'll figure out how it is that people are hearing our podcast.
Yes. Which radio station is this going out on again, Jeremy, off you go.
Six Music.
We'd better, before I humiliate myself any further, we'd better start talking about Fallout, or rather I'd better tee up some nice questions about Fallout, which Jeremy will then say some very interesting and smart things about and I will go, huh, yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so firstly, what were your first recollections of this when it came out in 1997?
Did you hear about it at the time? If not, when did you?
I didn't hear about it at the time. The first I knew of Fallout, I think, was a mate at school handed me a CD. It was like a ripped CD.
Oh, yeah.
And it was totally unannounced. We hadn't talked about it. He hadn't mentioned that he was gonna bring this in for me to the degree that I suspected that, like, had he originally made this for another purpose?
And he was just, you know, I was, I don't know what the circumstance was that led to him handing me this disc.
Uncharacteristic generosity of a secondary school child, I would say.
And he gave me this disc and he must have told me it was Fallout. And I went home and tried it and found it a bit weird, if I'm perfectly honest, Phil. As you would have been reminded by this point, Fallout begins with a big cave full of rats.
Oh, it does it ever.
Does it ever. And that's your introduction to its turn-based combat, which I wasn't really acquainted with. Just the idea of turn-based combat at that time sort of freaked me out.
Like I didn't really, the idea of it seemed so trickily and I didn't know whether I'd have the patience for it or the strategic mind for it. I think it's easy to forget, but I think a lot of people go through these kind of roadblocks with particular genres and what have you. And that was one for me, which is odd to look back on because I love a lot of turn-based tactics stuff now.
But yeah, I just found it very odd that I was punching rats using some kind of action point system. I had to, you know, every couple of times I punched a rat, I wouldn't be able to do it a third time and I'd have to wait for them to hit me back, gnaw on my ankles.
Yeah, you get very acquainted with that animation, don't you, of them gnawing?
Yeah, and I remember sort of liking the art style, which it seems to me now is sort of vaguely reminiscent of sort of 2008 or some kind of, you know, quite serious sci-fi comic. But I never played it again. I say never, I didn't play that version of it again.
The next time I played it was 2008, would that be right? It was in the run-up. I knew Fallout 3 was happening, it was coming out.
Yeah, so Fallout 3 dropped in 2008, didn't it?
So that's right. Yeah. And I'd just gone to uni and I didn't have a gaming PC and I didn't yet have my Xbox 360, which was my first ever console, got that at Christmas 2008.
So in the run-up to that.
That's quite late for you getting a console.
Yeah, what were you doing before then?
Just PC.
Yeah, in our house, it was, I don't know, my parents, they had a sort of strange attitude to this stuff where they were happy for me to play PC games to my heart's content. Or, you know, certainly on Saturday mornings while they weren't, you know, rather wouldn't rather we were doing more productive or outside things. Yeah.
But I think buying a dedicated gaming console, they thought that was a bit much. Like, what would that be encouraging? I've never asked them actually.
I don't know what their thinking was there exactly, but it's why my, you know, gaming sensibilities were shaped the way they were.
Yeah, well, my mom was very similar. There was something about consoles. I think it was a lot of the marketing, right?
A PC, you could ostensibly be doing your homework on it at any given moment. You were always just an alt tab away from doing something productive, but games consoles, there was none of that. And also the marketing was just completely different.
Like, because obviously PCs as an entity didn't market themselves. It would be, you know, Parker Bell would be an advert of like a whole family doing stuff on a PC and there'll be sort of lovely wide smiles and rosy cheeks and printers and things. Whereas like PlayStation adverts were really confrontational and like people's heads exploding because stuff was so intense.
So yeah, I think that put the fear into my mum as well about what that might be doing if I was exposed to these dangerous video games on console. But little did she know, I was playing Fallout.
Yeah. I mean, I can imagine my parents didn't like the idea of carving out a space in the house that was dedicated to games, or certainly not one that might commandeer the.
So that was the way it was. And actually, I got into consoles around the time when the PC franchises were appearing on them for the first time. I felt comfortable with the Xbox because Fallout was coming to it.
And Mass Effect and Half-Life and all of these traditionally PC threads were appearing there. So I was like, OK, yeah, I understand this. And so I had a plan to do that.
But in the run-up, I was like, right, I'm going to get into Fallout because I know this is the new big RPG happening. And I've been into Baldur's Gate and all this stuff. And this will be for me.
And that time I finally got it, you know. And I remember I have a very specific association between Fallout 1 and pot noodles. The orange flavour pot noodles.
Or the spicy one.
It's not right to call a pot noodle by like a food name. Like, because that's not really what they like. It was yellow flavour.
Oh, well, that is the curry one.
Yeah, that's right. No, it's right. That's the curry one.
Was it called the Bombay Bad Boy?
I would have remembered that.
I think it used to be. Because I'm not...
Right.
Where else would I have that from?
That sounds very like Lad Culture.
Yeah.
They were a pot noodle. Maybe they toned it down by 2008. But yeah, so I would come home, you know, I was first year at uni, not really applying myself because there's just this deeply lethargic atmosphere to living in first year uni halls.
You can go in there with the intention of working and being a good student, but it just seeps out of you immediately.
It's a difficult balance, isn't it, between spending as much time as possible in the kitchen. I remember the kitchen being a very important social space in halls. So you want to like soak up every all the fun stuff and not miss out on like this legendary thing that happened that was like top bands, but then also for the first time you've got like basically limitless video gaming time and no one's really going to hold you accountable.
And then third on the priorities list is going to uni.
Yeah, exactly.
So it's very difficult to balance and then you're also, you're 18. So like, you know, I guess some people are making all right choices, but I certainly wasn't.
And I studied English and music, so some people I knew would, you know, study aerospace engineering and they would have packed schedules through the week. You know, it's that way if you do medicine as well, those kind of courses, but humanities course tended to have one or two lectures at the beginning of a day, typically less. And I'd go in for them and I'd come back and by the time I'd walked back up the hill through Sheffield to my halls, I felt like I'd earned a pot noodle and three or four hours on Fallout.
You definitely had.
Yeah. So that's what I did and that's how I got to know it and it's a fond memory and I did love it and I was perfectly prepped for when Bethesda's reimagining came out.
Well, that is perfect timing. For me, it was another game from the aforementioned giant tin of games that came with my first gaming PC, so I've really gone for as light work as possible with this list of games that we came up with before we started doing this podcast. Just like what's just easily within reach in my memory, what have I played a load of already.
Was it in the tin? It's a tin out of ten.
This is the second game in the list that's come out of the tin, the first one being Blade Runner, but I do think it is considered like the quintessential 90s RPG as well. We were, just to go behind the curtain a little bit, we were tossing this one up between, it was between this and Baldur's Gate. Now if we were talking Baldur's Gate 2, then I think you'd have to go with Baldur's Gate 2 really.
It's the more interesting game and probably still the best isometric RPG there's ever been, but Baldur's Gate 2 was 2001, was it 2002? I think it was 2001.
I think it may have been 2000, they may be wrong.
2000? Well, we've got a three year spread there, we're gonna have to have a look.
I'll let you look. Yeah, I'm very fond of the first Baldur's Gate, but I recognize that...
It was 2000, Jeremy!
Hey!
September 2000. Wow, okay. So that's out of this podcast dream it, right?
Like it's PC Gaming Classics from the 1990s. And I think Fallout's impact was such that it's really fondly remembered us. As the outright best from this decade.
And I think that's evidenced by how popular all the sequels have become. And also how incredibly similar they are. Like how much is in the first game that Bethesda built out 3 and 4 from?
Yeah, it's quite striking, isn't it? Like so many of the iconic designs for the monsters and robots and the iconography of the vault, the jumpsuits, the cog-like door. All there, all there.
Pit Boy, the special system, it's just a perfect design doc for an open world 3D polygonal RPG in 2008. And it's all there in that 97 RPG. And I think in terms of like post-apocalypse, they had been explored in games before.
Obviously Wasteland had come several years earlier. But I think this was the first one that had seemed to have thought about the specifics of its own apocalypse quite this much. You know, the game begins with this incredible timeline sequence explaining so much about the world, how it all went to shit, why it's, well, I guess it's not really explained explicitly why they're trapped in a sort of 1950s limbo stylistically and culturally, but they've just really thought about it.
And then they thought about, okay, well, what would it be like if everyone was trapped in vaults for hundreds of years? Why would they be trapped in vaults for hundreds of years? And so it just seemed narratively complete and rich and deep in ways that the apocalypse hadn't really been before.
And I think that was a massive part of its impact at the time.
Yeah, very specifically, like tonally tuned. Like that intro, the famous intro with... It's Maybe, isn't it?
The song that's used in this one. I think they wanted... I don't want to set the world on fire, but they couldn't get the rights this time.
I don't want to set the world on fire. Indeed. I think Bethesda managed to get that one later.
They did. You have the slow zoom out from an old-worldy TV set. There's the advert on there for...
Is he called Mr. Handy? The sort of domestic robot with all these wiggly limbs and that sort of dream of domestic automation. You can put your feet up and you get the slow zoom out from that set.
And you see that the house around it is dilapidated. The floor's caved in and it seems further out and you see that all houses are that way. And suddenly the idea of domestic life, of ease of domestic life is just a mockery.
Just the idea of having this advert playing in this world is just a really striking bit of irony and that sets the feel for that game and all the Fallout games that have come afterwards.
Well, yeah, and even that device itself has been used in 3 and 4 as well, right? The chintzy, music-laden 1950s style optimism that zooms out and gives way to the reality of an apocalypse. Everything is in this first game that Bethesda needed to turn this into a blockbuster.
Modern series. It was very well received at the time. The review, this was pre when I was reading PC Gamer, so I don't know what the PC Gamer review score would have been, but I do remember it popping up a lot in the best ofs and, you know, the yearly top 100s and things like that.
So pretty fondly regarded. Certainly nothing like the sort of cultural megalith that it's become. But yeah, pretty fondly regarded at the time.
We should just go through some of the prominent names behind this one. And Jeremy, these are names of people who you have met and spoken to as well.
Yeah, yeah. Because a lot of the kind of key people from this game have over time gathered together at Obsidian. A few years back, I got a chance to speak to all of them about the making of Fallout, how it came to be.
Go on then, drop the names.
Drop the names.
There's Tim Kane. There's, you're putting me on the spot here, Fergus Urquhart, who was the head of Interplay's internal development, the RPG division at that time. It wasn't called Black Isle at that time.
They didn't come up with that name. But he was there and he's head of Obsidian today. Leonard Boyarsky, who was the art lead on the original Fallout.
I think Tim Kane was the design lead effectively. I think those are the ones that I spoke to. There are other key names on the original Fallout as well.
Yeah, I guess Chris Saylor would be the other big name in that one. Tim Kane, just to go through some of his other big hits and the games that he'd be associated with in addition to Fallout 2 that came out a year later. Just incredible how these studios turned around.
We'll just make a second one in a year. We're talking about that with Blade Runner, everything that Westwood achieved in a three or four year span. It's absolutely nuts, but I digress.
He was one of the programmers on Vampire Bloodlines along with Leonard Bajarski. Also programmer on South Park, The Stick of Truth, which I don't know, does that get enough love? I think that's a brilliant game.
That must have been when he arrived. That seems to me like an interim thing. Like, oh, you've arrived at Obsidian.
We'll get you your own project, which they did. The Outer Worlds is from both Tim and Leonard work on that series now at Obsidian. But yeah, maybe they are working on the South Park game for now.
So why don't you have at it? I can imagine the situation there.
Yeah, likewise, Pillars and Tyranny.
Well, it's been around for a little while now, yeah.
Yeah, some of the biggest games around in that genre. And Poliovsky was on Diablo 3 as well.
Oh, yeah.
So he's got around a bit. And also Arcane of Steamworks and Magic Obscura, if you're into that sort of deep cut. So yeah, you know, what we'd now consider quite a star-studded cast, but at the time, Interplay's team was sort of still making its name.
And I want to say this is the first one in their oeuvre that's sort of still talked about, and I'm going to check that. I don't think there's anything that precedes that. OK, well, I'm looking on the wiki page like a pro.
And for Leonard Biaski, we're talking Castles 2, Siege and Conquest, Unnatural Selection, Stonekeep. So I think it's with the greatest respect to those titles. I think it's fair to say that Fallout is the sort of breakout hit for the studio and for these devs.
Which is odd because I did learn when I spoke to them that this was very much not a valued project within Interplay at the time. Is that surprising or unsurprising? I don't know that something as specific and left field as this I suppose would always need to sort of slip under the radar a little.
And Interplay at the time was much more interested in sort of weird sports game initiatives and what have you that nobody remembers today. And the thing that they weren't paying attention to in the corner was the thing that would be, you know, Kickstart there, you know, the studio that is, you know, considered the publisher's greatest success now really. And yeah, Fall Out was the first of that kind.
I think I remember reading or hearing somewhere that the game basically got off the ground because Tim Cain was like such an evangelist for it. They had a working demo and he just set it up in a room, ordered a load of pizzas in and he didn't have leads on the project. I don't even think he had a team.
He just invited people in and they gave feedback. And if they were passionate about it, they became the team. So I think that's how he sort of managed to sneak it by the top brass interplay at the time.
Yeah, these weren't sort of official meetings. They were like, if you come to this room at this time, there'll be pizza. And also there was a project in there and it was Fallout.
Now, cards on the table, everybody. You're hearing this in a weird order. We're talking to you from the future because we forgot to go through all the Discord comments about the previous episode that we wanted to while we were talking about the game intro.
We know that you're still in the game intro, but we're not anymore. Anyway, let's not worry about that too much. Let's go through some comments, Jeremy, from our darling listeners about the last episode about Blade Runner.
What do you got, as Al Pacino says? He says, what do you got?
Does Al Pacino say that or do Rob Brydon and Steve Guggen say that in the trip during their impersonation? I assume it comes from a film, but that's the way that I know it.
I think it might come from Glengarry Glen Ross. Maybe it's one of those like, life is like a box of chocolate things, where it's like a similar quote, but it's never said that way. What do you got?
What do you got?
I've got Graham S saying, he popped in on the Discord to say he enjoyed the episode. As a console boy, these grown up games pass me by, other than in multi-format reviews. But now I've added it to my list of things, to get around to at some point before my Incept date plus four comes around.
That's a nice dark joke that...
His what date?
His Incept date. So you remember that the replicants in Blade Runner had a life. Four years in, their lives would end.
Right.
They had a built-in...
They've got to do that in the next... Sell-by date. Well, this leads on quite nicely onto the comment I was going to read out from Ben Blaster.
Hello, Ben, who says, Wrapped up the Blade Runner episode today. Another good one. Well done, backer boys.
To be honest, the most incredulous takeaway is Phil playing the entirety of Blade Runner the game without knowing it was a film, which always speaks to the fact that I also didn't get that reference from the previous comment.
It's all still incredulous. Yes.
He also says, If Samuel's conduct in this Discord is anything to go by, I can imagine that anecdote with the Wobble Board is everything Phil made out to be. Well, exactly.
It's Ryan here. Ryan's a Discord regular, thoroughly enjoyable episode, he said. As has been said before, it's just lovely hearing deep dives into games by people who like them.
He's just ended up buying Blade Runner in the sequel. I've never seen them before. So there's another person who was going to the films through the game.
It's the way to do it. Definitely the way round to do it. Jeremy says, I'm on Fallout New Vegas, which is bloody Jeremy Peele.
Run in your mouth. No doubt courting Review Wars votes in here.
I see. Never played the game, but both Jeremy and Phil convinced me that I need to play it.
Oh, thank you very much. More kind words.
Oh, yes. Beyond said, just started the Blade Runner pod. Jeremy's voice sometimes reminds me of the bear from the first island in black and white.
Please use the leash to bring your creature to me.
Oh, I know exactly who he's talking about. I've never drawn that line myself, but I love that deep cut. Oh, maybe we should have...
Black and White is 2001, isn't it? But again, slightly out of our remakes, but it's exactly the sort of game that I'd talk about for two hours.
Yeah.
Oh man, that bear. So that's a little smattering of comments from the Discord chat there. Thank you for those.
That's always really heartening to look through those. You can join that Discord if you like, and you'll see Jeremy pop in. I don't think I've said anything yet.
I'm shy. I'm just warming up. But Samuel's in there a bit.
I don't know if Matthew gets involved too, does he?
Less so. I think I'm the Samuel equivalent in terms of Discord involvement in our own partnership. I did link you a nice Discord comment the other day and you said, oh, I can't, I need to log in.
It's making me log in. What does it say?
Yeah, you said that I was trying to make you my internet maiden.
Yeah, handmade.
Internet handmaiden. I'm playing too much Elden Ring. Oh dear, well, I apologize for that, but yeah, thank you for those comments and check out the Discord.
So I think we've covered the broad strokes of the game intro there, right? So that's how it landed in the industry at the time and our first recollections of it. So Jeremy, let's stretch our legs, listen to some Fallout soundtrack, although mainly it's the sound of wind just whistling, isn't it?
But we'll enjoy that, shall we? And then reconvene to talk through Review Wars and our personal recollections and how it holds up in the modern day.
Okay, we're back, and we're picking up with Review Wars. So in this segment, we, Jeremy and I, write the intro paragraph of a review for this game as if we're writing it in situ back in the 90s for the games mags of the time, who had incredibly like high concept, playful, some might even say indulgent, ways in, in their reviews at the time. And then we also set it to sound and music because this is a podcast.
So that's the basic concept. But Jeremy, we have results from, from the previous review wars, do we not? So perhaps you'd like to talk us through, talk us through that and, and you know, who won and stuff like that.
Oh yeah, I've not got the numbers. I'm gonna bring in the numbers, but am I right in thinking that you wrote your review war on this, for this episode with the assumption that you lost?
Absolutely. So yes, you'll hear a reference in my review war submission, this episode listeners, that basically just absolutely assumes categorically that I've lost two on the trot. And yeah.
So ready to be the underdog.
Yeah, that's where all the power is. You know, it's easier to chase it down than it is to hold on to it. So.
Yeah, you're an overdog, mate. Your days of punching up are over, I'm afraid.
Okay, hit me with the results then.
The results of the Blade Runner episode review are as follows. Phil, 58% of the vote. And that's the majority.
You can figure out, yeah. There are only two competitors. So that's a clear victory.
I'm off the board. I'm on the board. I'm off the mark.
I'm on the board. Thank you to everybody who voted correctly for my excellent Song Wars review wars. I'm calling it Song Wars because it's very similar to a link that Adam and Joey used to do back on Six Musings.
I think now, if you remember what happened was that we'd done the same thing. So I think I've really benefited there from being the first to play their review wars because we both decided to do the Voight-Kamp test. Jeremy, ego maniacal as I am, even I know that yours was actually better than mine and described the game in much more artful terms.
Well, it's been established since that episode that yours was slightly louder, at a better.
Yeah, that's true. That's true as well.
I gave you the upper hand.
That's why when you put on, you know, you're watching TV and the adverts come on, they're compressed to fuck. So they're so loud and you're like, maybe I will buy a toaster. Maybe we'll go out and get a Burger King, you know?
Maybe this man will stop shouting at me if I get a Burger King.
So yeah, well, that's a real, this lends new meaning to this one because someone's going to be edging ahead and... That's true.
One, one now, aren't we?
It does make it, it makes my, it immediately dates mine because as I said, I've assumed that I've lost it. And then, so that's going to be now erroneous information, but you'll just have to rise above that if you will, please listeners. I think because I went first last time and benefited massively from it, I think you should go first this time.
And perhaps you'd like to tee it up with a little bit of your thinking. Let us in, in the actor's studio here, what was going on in your head?
So I know we were concerned last time around that we might have come up with the exact same concept and those fears were born out. And obviously, as happens when your worst fears come true, you reassess your life, you change some fundamentals. And that's what I've done this time around.
I've come up with something which I think you can't possibly have both done. And if we've used the same music for this one, I'll be thoroughly creeped out. It'd be a really weird coincidence.
So there's music. Okay, interesting. Well, without further ado then, let's hear Jeremy's submission for Review Wars Episode 3.
There's only so long you can spend wandering the Californian desert with the hot sun at your back before you conclude that Fallout is a western.
Oh, sure, they've swapped Stetsons for Stimpaks, and the Vault Dweller looks nothing like the archetypal Western hero. But that's exactly what they are.
Like a dozen different John Wayne characters, they're relied upon by a fledgling society to mediate with the wilderness. They head out into the wasteland and do exactly what is asked of them. They make sure that Vault 13 has a steady water supply and freedom from the oppression of super mutants.
But they're changed by the process. The wild seeps into their bones like radiation, and by the time they return home, they're no longer welcome. Their way of life is considered wayward and dangerous, a bad example to fellow Vault dwellers.
Like John Wayne, to clear the way for civilization, you will never have a place in it.
I'm here to tell you that you should do it all anyway. Fallout is a game in which you become stronger and stranger, more skilled and more intimidating, until the level of influence you wield over the wasteland is frankly a little scary. You may not particularly like this new version of you.
Ultimately, not even your mother would be able to meet your gaze.
But you'll have seen the future of RPGs, so you probably won't miss them all that much. Some fallouts? They're worth the cost.
You bloody brilliant bastard, Jeremy. You've done it again.
I will say that that soundtrack makes absolutely anything sound grand. I had to put in quite a bit of work to make sure I wasn't drowned out because there's obviously like that's something that really isn't compressed is the themes of the good, the bad and the ugly. It starts quiet and it ends incredibly loud.
It's not like the Just Eat ads, isn't it?
It's not a lot.
I love that. What was the last line? Some fallouts are worth it.
That's clever in ways that mine will never reach.
I'm glad you like that ending, but in case you didn't, I've actually put together an alternate one. I lost the last poll and gamers like being able to pick their own ending, so I thought this might give me a better shot at winning this time around.
Absolute scumbaggery this is. Absolute scumbaggery. Let's hear Jeremy's alternate ending to this episode's review wars then.
I'm here to tell you it's all worth it. Ballout is a game in which you become stronger and stranger, more skilled and more intimidating, until the level of influence you wield over the wasteland is, frankly, a little scary. You may not particularly like this new version of yourself.
My mother? Let me tell you about my mother.
Worse?
I feel really silly that I didn't see that coming.
Oh, this is going to sound really strange to those who haven't listened to the Blade Runner episode.
Yeah, well, I'm glad that we spent five minutes directing people back to the episode that they've definitely already listened to now, because you need to, to understand that alternate ending. But that's more absolutely stellar work, Jeremy. That was great.
And also, like, a very good, a very good bit of insight there that Fallout is actually a Western. I hadn't considered that.
Yeah, I'm always calling Game Secret Western's Death Stranding to, I believe, is a Western.
Interesting.
That's an argument for another day. All right, it's your turn.
Well, I feel nervous. I can confirm that I haven't used the same song, nor is this the same concept. It's a different concept because yours didn't rely on funny accents, whereas if you know mine, we'll always shoehorn one end.
I missed your American accent from before because I've been watching Knives Out and Glass Onion with that incredible, that absolutely incredible Southern accent. I do declare there's been a murder in here.
Yeah, folk on my corn.
Although I speak to my friend, she's from from Missouri, and she was like, I don't think it was that bad. So, you know, hush my mouth. Anyway, let's let's tee up this one.
What was I thinking? I was thinking, how can I do a funny voice? And how can I do something that requires a bit of production?
And also how can I shoehorn in the line, right? The format line, because that's my brand. Everyone expects me to go for the lowest common denominator, like the cheap, low-hanging fruit.
So all of this informed what you're about to listen to now. So without further ado, here's my submission for this episode of Review Wars. Vault dweller, yes you.
Well, what do you know, Joe? Boy, howdy the new generation of young go-getter had better know as onions, because it's a new world out there, brimming with opportunities. Oh, maybe you're been out of shape about the whole world being blown up in a nuclear apocalypse, but don't be, as Socrates once said, the secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.
And I believe in you, buddy, because you've got the strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck to take on the wastelands. You better believe it, buddy, you're special.
Special.
Special, that's what they told me before they kicked me out of the vault and sent me here into the desert for a stupid water purifier. Strength, yeah, the strength to take on rad scorpions and death claws with only a pistol and a sidekick who shoots at me as often as he shoots an enemy. We get by, but every battle takes its chunk out of us.
Perception, everyone here in this hinterland wants their pound of flesh from me. Go here, do this, click on those. The hardest part isn't doing it for them, it's remembering what they even wanted done in the first place.
Damn journals, no help. I know someone wanted me to clear out this irradiated caravan, but who and why? Endurance, any isometric RPG will test that.
And Interplay's post-nuclear vision is no different. By the time I found their damn water chip, 150 long brown days had passed. Days that changed me forever.
Charisma, well, you only have to look at the results of the previous review wars to see the dice didn't land on a high number for me in that category. Intelligence, well, you can talk your way out of a fight or two out here if you've got the smarts. It saves on bullets, I find.
I know Ian prefers it. He gets very embarrassed about his aim. Before I left the vault, they told me I needed agility, but I didn't know how much.
Power armour, energy weapons, lockpicks, sneaking. I can't do any of it.
And luck. Luck! Well, you might find the odd flying saucer out here if Karma's smiling on you.
But whichever way you slice it, if you're living out here, you're living in a war. And you know what they say about a war? War is fucking shit.
So there we go. A few things have occurred to me as I was listening to it back. Like, why would a review in the 90s in a games mag reference the previous episode of Review Wars, you know?
But you've got to go with these things. And I'm pretty sure that that last line will be subbed out.
Oh, that was a very good last line.
Also, what I would say as well, I think if I was an editor, I'd be like, is this going to be a favourable review or not? Because it's like I'm going to slate it, isn't it? And I think I was just going for that sort of grizzled tone that survivors have.
World weary, yeah.
Yeah, it was great.
Great contrast. The music at the beginning reminded me a little of a YouTube trend of a little while back, where people would mix songs to sound like they were playing in like an empty mall.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was quite good that I quite enjoyed that. So you'd hear like take on me, but in a sort of very reverb heavy and slightly distant way.
Yeah, slowed and reverb. It's a bit like Simpson's wave and what's the other wave? But yeah, you know, like Macintosh Plus.
Yeah, there was a there was another trend about stuff sounding like it's played in the next room, which I always think is quite a soothing, you know, a soothing lesson. But yeah, that was that was that was really great. And he got through every every skill in the game, every every special point.
So that was good. Yeah, Ian, mate. Oh, God, he's taking chunks out of all of us.
You didn't hand in a hand in a hand in a newsie, did you?
Because no, only ever a handgun for Ian. You can't spell liability without Ian. You can't.
Don't think about that too much. Don't go back and check. You can't.
I'm glad you didn't use War Never Changes, because I know it's a fallout tradition, but I'm not sure about it. What does it mean?
And also, I think that really died a death by the time of the Fallout 4 reviews, because so many reviewers had used it in reviewing Fallout 3, that it was just like social death to use it. And it occurred to everybody. So I just thought, well, I've got to, you know?
Apologies to anyone listening out there who did use it in a review or tweeted it.
Particularly when a series is starting to stagnate a little bit, it's not really the sort of series catchphrase you want, is it?
Yeah, it was a little bit too appropriate for Fallout 4. But there we go. So once again, our podcast parents will put up a poll.
Jesus, that's a hell of a line. I hope the old pop filter is up to that one on my mic there. Our podcast parents will put up a poll for you to vote for your favorite one.
And just, you know, keep in mind that our tiny, delicate, fragile egos lay in your hands when you do. Yeah, fine.
That'll be on Twitter.
It will. And we'll be announcing the results of that in the next episode. So Jeremy, let's move on.
Let's talk about our recollections of this game and also our modern playthroughs in the last few weeks of it. So firstly, how much of a fan are you of the franchise in general, I guess? Like you were playing Fallout to psych yourself up for Fallout 3, and I think that's probably most people's entry point to the franchise at this point.
So looking at the franchise as a whole with New Vegas and 4 and 3, Tactics and 2, how engaged with you in it are you? I didn't mention 76. I'm going to still not mention 76.
I guess what I'm asking is, do you like Fallout?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm very into it. I came out of that period of loving Fallout 1 and then Fallout 3 surprised me in really great ways.
There was sort of Deus Ex influence in there that nobody was really expecting. You could do proper first person stealth and all this kind of thing, and yet it also was a full RPG with these sort of smart little hacking mini games. It felt like it had so much going on with it and felt like a classic PC game, even though I was playing it on a console.
I loved Fallout 4 as well because there had been a long gap, but I couldn't help but notice that not an awful lot had changed in the interim, apart from the addition of a sort of construction system. I think I'm with a lot of people and feeling a sort of a sense of fatigue about it at this stage.
Yeah, I agree massively. You wonder what they're going to have to do in order to meet that insane demand and keep it fresh, keep it feeling like Fallout in the next game. It seems like they've painted themselves into a bit of a corner by releasing three in New Vegas and four in what was actually quite quick succession.
I guess there must have been a long gap between New Vegas and four, right? But I don't know, at this stage, it was pretty 76 by Bethesda standards was hot on the heels of Fallout 4 and New Vegas was hot on the heels of three. Like I know that I was, you know, the fact I didn't play New Vegas at the time, despite being from, you know, a load of developers I loved, an Obsidian game was entirely down to the fact I'd played 150 hours of Fallout 3.
Yeah, and there's also Skyrim in there. Maybe that's why it doesn't feel like quite such a gap for me, because probably if you're the type to put 150 hours into Fallout 3 or New Vegas, then you're going to spend a fair bit of time in Skyrim as well. And you start to, you start to see the seams of everything.
You start to see the inner workings and you're like, oh, yeah, I noticed that asset. I can see the modular tool set here at work, and I can see all the little bits that make up Dungeons and how they're being applied. And then you can see that that's obviously how, how 4 is made as well.
Yeah, something about the texture work as well.
Yeah, you grow a little tired of the dodgy animations and all this kind of thing. But, you know, 76 was quite bold in some ways, you know, but it's sort of a failed experiment in the sense that, you know, now Bethesda have introduced NPCs to it and more traditional quests where previously they had this conviction that any, any human in the landscape you would know was another player. And, and I don't know, people found that a bit odd, understandably.
You know, it was a, it was a world where always the action had happened just over the next hill and, you know, the people you were chasing after or hoping to catch up with you knew you never would in your quest line because there weren't any people in the world apart from players. And I did have some really cool interactions with players in Fallout 76. Like, it's quite an unusually friendly community.
You know, it's not a voice chat game or at least it's a, I can't remember whether it's possible, but it's unusual to have voice chat in that game. And people communicate through things like, you know, found notes. So like, you know, bits of environmental storytelling that Bethesda popped around the world.
I would have people show up at my, the little sort of riverside hut. Hut's not fair. In fact, my partner put a lot of work into the designer of that place.
It was a good little house and players would show up and they would, you know, they would talk to us through like drop notes and would show them to the water purifier we had out back. And they go on the way with some non-radiated sustenance. So that was a good time.
But the formula has remained the same underneath for a long, long time. So even though I have a full out bobblehead on this desk right now.
Do you indeed?
I think really coming back and playing Fallout 1 again is the thing that has kind of revived my enthusiasm. For the series, for the first time in a long time.
Well, I was just going to ask. If you're jaded by all the modern, brown, slightly janky, animated ones, then what was it like to go back to this first one? Turn-based and nearly isometric?
Yeah, janky in all sorts of different ways.
It is a fantastic antidote to a lot of modern RPGs in that it's very respectful of your time for that one. There may be three dungeons in this game, and each of them, if you manage to delve them, will yield some kind of fundamental revelations about what's going on in this world, what the conspiracy is behind the sudden appearance of super mutants and all this kind of central story stuff. There really isn't any filler in this game, and that's partly down to the way it's structured.
You have these sort of discreet areas, isometric maps like you would in a Baldur's Gate, but when you explore between them, you're on an overworld map, and you see time passing, but you don't have your time wasted by interim, mostly empty areas. I felt like every time I touched down somewhere in this game, I was able to change something about it. I was able to kind of learn about a place and have a real impact on it in some form, and then move on somewhere else.
So it feels like in a genre that has often sold itself on choice and consequence, this is one of the few that really delivers on that. Like minute by minute, there are meaningful ways that you can alter the communities and the places that you're passing through.
Yeah, and even the character creator is a lot more profound in its effects than I remembered and also much more than a modern. So if you have an intelligence of zero, then you're unable to talk. You don't just come across as dumb.
You physically cannot speak to anybody. You get the entire playthrough without the ability to converse, and that obviously profoundly changes how you approach the game. And so yeah, the special system is pretty radical in that way.
You can, you know, I'll be honest, I've only ever played it with somebody who's like pretty intelligent and pretty strong because that's quite an easy ride of it. But like you can create some really unusual and challenging builds that just force you to play the game in very specific ways. And there's a satisfaction that comes with that in itself.
Yeah, it's funny. I initially started this time with a low intelligence character. I thought, oh, this will be interesting.
I've never done this before. Pretty quickly I decided I didn't want to do that because there are so many interesting conversation options that become available to you otherwise. And it's not a game that shouts about it.
You know, it doesn't have in the sort of the dialogue box. It doesn't tell you, oh, you could have said this if you were smart.
I just don't know how you would go about achieving so much. You know, you mentioned the revelation about the super mutants. I guess just a quick spoiler warning because we will be getting into some plot elements and a few of the big reveals.
But that's a pivotal moment in the game when somebody tells you that the super mutants are all infertile and you go down this sort of narrative path exploring the origins of the super mutants that eventually leads you to the master. How would that happen if you can't speak to them? I don't understand.
I mean, I guess the answer is to play it and find out. But it's mad that... And they must have known that just a fraction of players would ever choose to spec up a low intelligence character.
And yet they must have had to make sure that the entire game is feasible like that. And the same goes for somebody who's got crazy luck, for example. There are random encounters that happen if you're really lucky.
Like the flying saucer, the encounter with the aliens. You get like a crazy alien blaster that I think is the most powerful weapon in the game. And you only get that if your luck skill is really high.
I assume that was a Fallout 2 sort of zany edition. I didn't realize that that was a thing in this one.
Exactly. Yeah, it's a load of content. We always love this, right?
There seems to be the three line in most of the games that we both like. Is that the developers have toiled away for hours on stuff that most people will never discover. It's such a badge of honor for a particular type of game, isn't it, to do that.
That begins with the special system and it continues all the way through the game's design. I actually felt like the beginning and the end are spectacular. It's got one of the great beginnings in all games, even up to this date.
It's so good that Fallout 3 and 4 found it perfectly appropriate to mirror it by and large. It's such an engaging way of introducing you to a really fleshed out and thought about world that's gone through this cataclysmic change. I just found the ending absolutely bewitching and wonderful.
The design of characters when you're speaking to them, you're talking to, I think, what's actually like a stop motion claymation.
Yeah, there is a claymation expert credited on the game.
And the design of some of those characters, it's haunted me since I was 11. The design of the master is just like a nightmare. He's an incredible character.
Yeah.
But yeah, so it's got these incredible bookends. And then I found in the middle, and also I just enjoyed when you do get to somewhere new, when you go to like a facility that's gray and you're just like, oh my God, this is so different to the brown that I've been looking at for the last 18 hours. It feels like a real accomplishment.
But I did find that in the middle, I just had a real problem, like not even remembering where to go, but just knowing, figuring out what the game wanted me to do next and how to go about that. And like I'd have a look in the pit boy and there wasn't really much. And it obviously wants you to like instead engage with the game, listen to what everybody says and all that, you know, all that stuff that we say we like, but we don't really like.
So, so yeah, I spent a lot of time actually just floundering and like retreading, which, you know, I've got to, I've got to apportion at least half the blame there to me. But yeah, I was really playing it for the beginning and the ending and the rest of it was a means to an end.
Well, I mean, the beginning and ending are obviously very striking. That's kind of what inspired my approach to the review war this time. But yeah, I don't know whether I kind of half remembered, you know, where certain things were that would push the story forward.
But I didn't flounder so much this time. I do know that, like, a really controversial element of this game, which is the timer, right? And I think that I can't remember whether it was when I spoke to them or somebody else did, but the lead developer said, have since said, you know, there's one thing we would have changed about this game is to get rid of the timer, which is initially, the fault you're coming from is water purifier has broken down.
And, yeah, there's essentially a countdown until everyone you know and love is going to die of dehydration. So you've got to go out in the world and you've got to find one of those and bring it back within. I can't remember how many days it is.
Maybe a hundred and fifty days, a hundred and fifty, which can actually sort of fly by if you do a lot of meandering back and forth on the overworld. I saw I'm sort of a defender of it. I really like the subversion of the typical RPG thing, which is time doesn't move until you do, basically.
Everything waits for you. There's a comfort in that. That's part of why the genre is such effective comfort food.
You can always come back to something later. But yeah, there's something special and strange about the sense that you have a duty and that you've got to find a solution to this thing and it leads to a certain desperation.
So yeah, we're getting to spoiler territory a little bit, but you come across this ghoul-inhabited city. So the ghouls in Fallout being people are radiated to the point where most of them still have their faculties about them, but they are the sort of living oddly extended lives while, you know, looking like their faces are falling apart. And they have a water purifier, you know, they have the chip that you need.
And you can go in there and you can take it and you can leave the ghouls to death, basically. And there's a way to repair a, you know, sort of a well system so you can make sure that you're not leaving them with nothing. But I think that the sort of the pressure of the time is what leads you to, you know, as a player, it's quite feasible that you might go, well, I just need this, you know, I need this for my people, so I'm going to take it.
I'm sorry. Be out of there because you know, you've only got, you know, 30 days left or whatever, and you don't know how you're going to come up with another solution. Or it might lead you to kind of, you know, the ingenuity of kind of going to the hub, the sort of caravan town and go, OK, there are water merchants here.
You know, maybe I can strike a deal with them and that will buy me some time to go and find this chip. So I like that, that setup and the fact that it's real, you know, things happen. And it's not just the water chip thing either.
You know, if you muck about too long in the wasteland, the super mutants will start. You know, there'll be consequences for settlements around the place because you haven't dealt with the main threat, you know. So there's a sense of responsibility and consequence to this game, which I think is kind of defining.
I do love a game that seems to be operating on a time that's independent of you. The classic example is, and I don't really like this game so much, but it is the poster boy for this, Deadly Premonition. Every NPC in that town has a daily routine and it's quite involved.
And you can sort of get to know people's patterns and just follow them around. And they just seem to be living quite rich lives that are completely independent of you. And if you need them to further a particular quest and they're out, you've just got to wait.
If they pop down the diner, you've either got to know that they're at the diner, because they always go to the diner at three on a Thursday, or you just got to wait for them to come back. And if the rest of the game wasn't awful, terrible junk, then that would be a good thing. I've never really liked Deadly Premonition, but I do like that design principle.
I like to see it elsewhere. I think Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns also has a similar system, and there's a big time pressure on achieving your objective, because I think the citizens of... Have you played this one?
Can you help me out with this? There's like a Groundhog Day element. I think it all operates on a 24-hour clock.
They're trapped in time by a sinister force that's probably something to do with crystals, because it's Final Fantasy. I'm remembering, like, with 10% clarity. But again, you have to get to know people's routines.
There's a lot of effort gone into programming AI, so that they have the appearance of living lives, and you intersect them at certain points, and you manipulate time to make certain things happen, to meet certain quest conditions. So that's always great. And yeah, I like that in this as well.
I think depending on the version that you play, that timer has been removed. So if you play Fallout Fixed, which has a lot of modern mod cons, like being able to scroll the inventory, I think that timer is removed. I think they might have patched it out on release.
I think they did pretty quickly. But at that time, people didn't patch.
Yeah, it would have been a very small amount of people who it would have even occurred to search for a patch, and then let alone correctly install it. So the version that I played was the original game disc, and I didn't patch it, so the timer was in effect. There's also another timer, which is a bit more abstract.
It's a 500-day timer, and I think that kicks in from the moment that you get the water purifier, and it's about when the super mutants come and ransack everything and destroy your vault community. But that's a long time, it's 500 days.
Yeah, I've never reached that. But yeah, there's an obvious downside to that, right, of like somebody's been using the same save for 40 hours or whatever, and then they realize that it's too late for them to actually complete the game. Nobody wants to be in that situation.
That happened to me with Dead Rising.
Oh really?
First Dead Rising. Because that's another one. It's not very sophisticated in terms of how time operates, but you do just have 72 hours, and you need to rescue as many NPCs as you can, and that they appear based on the time of day and certain enemies and things.
Anyway, you just have to be on the roof of the mall, you have to be on the helipad at the end of the time, or otherwise it just leaves without you. Somehow it just left without me. That was my save game done.
Just to start again.
Yeah, I mean, I guess the flip side of that stuff in Fallout is something that many RPGs have mimicked since. The sort of post-ending scene where you get to see what's happened individually to these different settlements that you've been involved in. And depending on certain actions you've taken or haven't taken, quests you've completed, people you might have killed, they'll have different fates.
Some of that is blocked. I didn't find out about this Fallout fixed mod until after I played, but there's at least one faction in the game that you can't actually save because the quest line that would allow you... So they're a tiny group called the Followers of the Apocalypse.
And they're in New Vegas as well, I found them in there. But they're big on preservation of knowledge, as opposed to preservation of weaponry, which is the Brotherhood of Steel's thing. And they have a spy inside the cathedral, which turns out to be a sort of crucial...
There's a cult that may or may not be linked to the big threat in the world. And so they can kind of help you in there. And actually the spy reminded me where I needed to go to actually find the master, the pig bad.
And I'm not sure how long it would have taken me without her assistance. So I would have liked to have helped them, but unfortunately the quest line to do that doesn't exist in the game's release. So that was unfortunate for them.
But like, I can't think of a game before this. So it's certainly the first one I was aware of that had that, you know, gave you that sense that you'd swum through all these places and that you'd have an impact on them. And you got to see that after the fact.
And, you know, feel some pride and feel some guilt. Just a curious and fascinating mix of emotions right at the end of the game.
Yeah, very satisfying epilogue. Dragon Age carried that over, didn't it? Dragon Age likes to put an epilogue that shows you every individual decision and gives you a little cutscene, however trivial.
What did you make of the combat though, right? Because as we've alluded to, so much of Fallout is baked into this original game and has expanded out, even the faction, the Brotherhood of Steel are in this game. And they're basically philosophically unchanged from one all the way through to four.
But what has changed is that this is a turn-based isometric RPG with hex tiles and sidekicks. So how did you get on with the fights themselves?
I had a good time with it this time around, but it does require you to be quite forgiving. I kind of pulled points in melee weapons and managed to get hold of some power armor and a big sledgehammer, so that was quite satisfying. Things tended to go well for me, the deeper I got into the game.
One of the frustrations is with the companions.
Through the bartering system, which I would like to come back to because it's unexpectedly important and cool, you can give weapons and stuff and stimpaks to your companion, who is invariably Ian. I think a bloke that you meet in Shady Sands, the first village that you pass through and either need to pay him or not, depending on how high your charisma or persuasion skill is. But you can't give him armour.
This is a thing. You pass them weapons and stimpaks. You can throw them over the fence through the bartering menus, and they will use the most powerful thing they're capable of using in battle.
Well, I didn't even find that Ian did that all the time. I found that Ian very much would do his own thing when it came to which weapon he selected for it. It might just be fists.
He might just go in fist, he'd have a perfectly good pistol, and he'd have ammo. But then we're playing different versions of the game. Certainly in the original disc, Ian was just an absolute loose cannon.
Yeah, and the deeper you get into the game, the more sort of consequential it is. The fact that he's running around basically in a leather jacket and jeans, coming up against plasma rifles and laser weapons.
And also a lot of people in leather jackets and jeans, exactly like Ian. Surrounded by people that are the same model as Ian.
In the early game, it's Ian's versus Ian's. Once you're coming up against super mutants, and I was there in my power armor and that felt quite, that brings you up to about the same size as a super mutant. That feels right.
But I had a point where the Brotherhood of Steel offered me a second set of power armor and I had to say, no thanks because Ian doesn't know how to put it on. But that would have been incredibly useful. And so a lot of the late game battles were defined by me figuring out how to draw fire from Ian and Dogmeat the dog.
He was determined to bring through to the end because they just get torn in half very quickly. I could take a real pummeling, but they couldn't take any damage whatsoever really. So I figured out that the enemy AI attacked whoever hit them last.
So I had to try and make sure, you know, I get the last hit.
You were drawing all the attention. Yeah. Dogmeat's got a terrible habit of running through armed laser doors, I find.
Oh God, yeah.
There's a lot of quick saving involved in keeping he and Ian alive. Yeah. Yeah, you do have to be super forgiving.
I think I've never been massively into turn-based. Well, certainly not until Divinity. And then that just did it so well, because there were always so many status modifiers available on each arena of battle.
You know, you could shoot an oil barrow. Barrow. Shoot an oil barrel.
And then, you know, cause some fire effects or you could... There was just always something to do that made you feel like you were really clever. And obviously Divinity came quite a few decades after this.
But given that that's the game that I'd spent the most time in turn-based combat with, I was looking around for like other ways to be smart. And there aren't really... That's not really how it works in Fallout.
It's a combination of the special system, you know, your character stats, the weapons that you've found and the sidekicks. And, you know, they really form the variables of each combat encounter. And by modern standards, that's not very many variables.
So you end up having a lot of quite similar encounters and some quite frustrating ones where, you know, Ian might shoot you. Or, and this is another good reason to quick save often, Ian might shoot a friendly. He might shoot an NPC in a town.
And then the whole town's against you and you can't ever go to that town again. Which actually did happen to me in Divinity as well. So it's not just a fallout problem.
But I remember, like, in Scytheale in Divinity 1, I had a little, like, side hustle going where I would steal people's paintings. Because a lot of those paintings were pretty valuable around the houses of Scytheale.
Anyway, they're fun to pull off the wall, aren't they? They're huge.
Oh, they're good. And you can sell them, like, almost instantly. You get back out into that little market area where the, you know, the woman that's going, let's see, halibut, sheep's cheese.
Yeah, and there's the other fellow who's going, no man is as happy as the man with many cheeses.
That's it. Or the guy is like, Scytheale, Scytheale, shivery timbers and slippery heels. I actually really dislike the NPCs in this.
It's like playing a pantomime for 140 hours. It's really obnoxious. Anyway.
So, but anyway, one day somebody caught me stealing their painting and just like set about me. But then what happened is everybody in Scytheale attacked me. Which like, at the best of times.
Which takes about two hours per turn, right?
Exactly. At the best of times that would be an inconvenience. But you've just got to watch 300 NPCs taking two steps towards you every turn.
It's infuriating. And that also happens to a smaller extent in Fallout. So, yeah, quick save all the time.
Because Ian is bound to bloody shoot somebody and sends everybody against you. And then you've got to watch them all inch their way towards you. And that's beautiful.
It's funny you mentioned divinity and you're right in Fallout. The combat is a lot simpler and there's a lot less clever and silly combining of elements that you can do. But I got really into this time through Fallout, the reverse pickpocket, right, which a lot of Fallout players know about because Fallout 3 made quite a big deal of it.
There was achievements based on it where you could sneak up on someone, pickpocket them, and obviously you can take stuff off the person, but you can put stuff back as well. And you can pop a grenade in there and they'd be none the wiser until they exploded a short while later. And Fallout 1 is the origin point of that idea.
This barter system which let you trade anything for anything with a merchant or pretty much any character, right, you can choose to barter with almost anyone. But it's also the same menu that's used for companions managing their inventory and also for pickpocketing. And so I got really into the dynamite, which you can set timers on.
And these really sort of high concept indirect kills which almost felt sort of like immersive simi. Where I was, there was the, there's door guards that really got it in the neck or rather the necks and every other part of them exploded outwards. But I was kind of quick saving my way to figuring out, okay, so this door guard in the hub, who's guarding the, he's called Dexter, who's the sort of gang boss there.
Well, he needs, he's a tough guy. And I worked out I needed three sticks of dynamite to blow him up. So I like set all the individual timers on my sticks of dynamite.
And you can see him like the red lights flashing on them in your inventory. If you don't get him out quick enough, you go. You know, that's it for you.
And I was pick-pocketing this guy and stuff, like emptying his pockets of weapons and bottle caps and filling him up with bombs. And then wandered over the other side of town and just kind of waited for the booms, the three booms, and saw him get torn apart.
You'd think after the first one, he might try and empty his pockets at least.
Yeah, he ran out into the street, so I was able to see it. It was messy.
But the game is smart enough or systemic enough to let you get away with that because nobody sees you do it and you're over the other side of town. And I was really pushing it further. There's one Stealth, there's one Thieves Guild quest in this game, which I've never found before.
The idea that there's a Thieves Guild in Fallout World is quite strange, but it involves stealing a necklace from a mansion in the hub. And there was an unfortunate door guard there as well. But that map was too small for me to kind of escape the consequences of, you know, there was nowhere I could go that was far enough away that people didn't go.
This guy's just exploded. And there's a bloke standing on that corner over there who we've never seen before. It was probably him.
But I figured out if I stuck plastic explosives on this fella, left the map and came back, the game remembered that I'd stuck this bomb on him, set a timer, and even though it unloaded the level, when I came back, he was a smear on the pavement and I could safely break into this mansion. So there's this really like deep and quite janky, but very impressive level of like systemic nonsense, which feels very like sort of Divinity and deus exe in this.
Oh yeah, and on that Divinity comparison as well, I wanted to really sort of nail my colours to the mast on its tone of voice, because it's tongue in cheek in a similar way to Divinity, but whereas I find it like nails down a blackboard in the Divinity games, which nonetheless I've spent many, many happy hours with. I think Fallout pulls off that slightly, I guess you'd call it zany tone, much more successfully. And I don't mean zany as a pejorative, I think it really, I don't know, there's just a lot of like, there's a lot of like colliding elements, like 50s kitsch and like outlandish sci-fi, and like a lot of the NPCs have, you end up having some really bizarre conversations with the NPCs.
And like, and it's, it's somehow it's all coherent. There are all these disparate elements and disparate influences and tones of voice, but the humour is like just infrequent enough that you can still see Fallout as a kind of gritty survival experience. But it's just, it's just there to kind of nod you along and it gives you this enthusiasm.
Like it's got an infectious enthusiasm for itself. Like I remember I was reading in the, in the run up to this, I was reading the original story for the game that they proposed. It's absolute nonsense.
It's like, it's completely bonkers. You're, you're transported to the past because you find a pair of like radioactive underpants that are hit by lightning and you go back to the past. There's a monkey involved.
You have to do a bunch of things in the past to affect your future. And it's like, it sounds like a like Brendan Fraser movie Blast From the Past, right? Like it sounds like ITV2 Sunday Night sort of fare.
But somehow that tone of voice is carried over into Fallout really successfully in a way that doesn't make me sort of cleanse my fists and ball up my, my cheeks.
I think it's fair play Fallout. Yeah, I think it's helped by the sort of brevity of the dialogue as well. I was surprised by how unshowy it is.
You know, like Divinity, especially that first one, is very big on puns and alliteration and stuff. And you know, Obsidian Games and you know, the likes of Disco Elysium are very sort of prose heavy, very literary. Fallout's not very literary at all.
It's very simple, like there's loads, what's impressive and fun to play with is all the possible permutations of the dialogue, but people speak very simply to you in this game. You know, it's not, it's not indulgent in that way. And I think that's a characteristic of Blackout, Planescape aside, notable exception, but like Icewind Dale as well, very sort of like concise, loads of story to dig into if you want to, but it's not, it doesn't just kind of hold forth and hold you hostage with dialogue.
And that's still kind of an impressive thing, even though places it is sort of patchy and there are typos and things like that. It's obviously a game made by very few people, but overall, like it's, again, it's that sort of respect for your time and a rare RPG that sort of actually make a beeline for the things that you're really interested in, if that's what you want to do.
It does respect your time, doesn't it? There's one more bit of gameplay nonsense that I wanted to bring up. I wanted to ask you, Jeremy, whether you indulge in the casino exploit or not.
So there's an NPC that you meet midway through the game called Gizmo.
Gizmo, I remember him. Wow, he's got an incredible set of animations, hasn't he? Because he never leaves his desk.
And he's at such a scale that you get the impression that he couldn't leave his desk. Even in combat, he just sort of sits from behind it and fires with his pistol. And that's a good use of the reverse pickpocket there.
You can plant a bug on him. But no, I'm not aware of the exploit.
Okay, so Gizmo runs a casino. If you work up your... Gosh, is it your luck?
You basically have to work up one skill to above 50 and you will win more often than you lose. If you work it up to 60, then you can break the economy instantly in one visit to the casino. And thereby, you've just got limitless cash and well, limitless bloody irradiated bottle caps.
And then you can buy anything in the whole game. It's a very tempting exploit if you know about it, because why wouldn't you give yourself free money forever? But apparently, you're simply more ethical than that and it never occurred to you.
Well, I just picked a fight with the dodgy loans guy in the hub and yeah, he suddenly no longer with us, but I got 2000 caps out of it. And that set me, you know, I was set for a little while then, at least until the late game when money wasn't so much of an issue. So that was how I dealt with that problem.
Well, sounds very effective.
Did you get to see inside the Brotherhood in this play?
No, I didn't. I didn't meet the Brotherhood.
That's a funny one, isn't it? Because the first time I played it, I found the bunker, but I didn't ever get in there. And this time I did.
But yeah, you mentioned earlier like, oh, they're kind of, you know, they're sort of unchanged over the games. But a realisation for me this time has been, actually, they work, they were pretty different organisation back in the day. Like Fallout 3, Brotherhood, a sort of very sort of, you know, they're interventionist, aren't they?
They're out in the wasteland, they're picking fights with super mutants, they're trying to improve the lot of survivors in general. The lot that you find in California couldn't be less bothered about the rest of the wasteland. Like, they send you down an irradiated pit and say, you know, just bring something back to show us that you were there.
And it becomes apparent that they just tell people to do that, to get them off the back, you know, because they're sick of people showing up at the door, excited by their power armour and their exciting weapons.
I remember that bit there, yeah.
Yeah, they're just hoarders, really. That's what they're about. They're pulling in all the weapons and fancy armour of the Wasteland to sit on it, and they haven't really figured out, you know, a third step for what comes afterwards.
They're not, you know, they're not the heroes of the Wasteland. And you can sort of get them involved in the main quest, but they're very grudging about it. They have a, like, check in and out system for their weapons and armour, and they then, you know, you basically have to deal with the master by yourself.
And to Bethesda's credit, like, they do, you know, the chapter in Fallout 3 is a sort of, like, has broken off from the main one. Like, they've sort of been disavowed because they're too helpful, essentially. The HQ back in California is like, we don't understand what you're about, why you keep trying to make things better for people.
Honestly, all we care is that you find some fancy tech while you're out there on the East Coast. So, you know, Bethesda obviously decided they wanted the Brotherhood to be more sort of vanilla heroes to a degree. And they did kind of account for that.
But it's interesting to see, like, there are no heroes in Black Isle's imagining of a post-apocalyptic world.
No, very rarely. It's playing on my mind. So I've just got to revisit the gambling exploit.
The skill is actually a bespoke gambling skill that you increase the more you gamble.
Oh, God, there's so many skills. They're definitely like near redundant skills, aren't they, in this game?
Yeah, I don't even know how many there are, but yeah, there's a gambling skill. You get that above 50% and you'll win more often than you lose and then you can break the economy. So that's Fallout, then, from 1997.
We had better decide whether it's getting tried and convicted in 90s games court or whether it's acquitted and celebrated as part of the great pantheon of foundational 90s PC games. So I wonder whether we might actually fall down on different sides this time, for the first time in the series, Jeremy, but where's your head at with this one?
Well, yeah, it seems to me like you'd recommend the first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes and maybe not so much the 30 or 40 hours in between, whereas I'm quite keen on the middle bit. Yeah, I guess I sort of... I guess it can vary a lot on playthrough, can't it?
I think I looked out and I remembered certain things and I had quite a nice flow to my time with Fallout, so it was relatively frictionless, whereas, you know, if I'd had the experience that you'd had, it sounds like there's a lot more meandering and you notice the sort of emptiness of parts of the world more so during that kind of experience, right?
I don't think I helped myself by playing Elden Ring at the same time. So, you know, I'm thinking to myself now, like, do I want to incarcerate the game? You know, it's someone's life we're talking about here.
Like, should they be thrown in jail just because I didn't like the middle bit? And I, you know, I still liked the middle bit. I was just, like, propelling myself forwards towards the end because I remembered it being cool.
And I sort of felt like as well getting the water chip was the end, and I forgot that that wasn't the end. So that was a bit disappointing. So I don't think I can really level these as failings of the game.
I think this is more the energy that I brought to it. So many aspects of it hold up so well. I think the art direction, it speaks for itself because it's used almost verbatim.
Every bit of text in every Fallout game is the same shade of bright green on a black background. The pit boy is there. The blue boiler suit is there.
You know, the design of the vaults. Everything ran away.
Deathclaws.
Yeah, the deathclaws apparently were... They had begun work on a D&D game and they'd started making the clay models to make the sprites out of. So it's actually a D&D universe creature, but then they cancelled that game and they were like, call it Deathclaw?
Yeah.
So every NPC you speak to about deathclaws in Fallout just kind of goes... We don't know.
Don't know what they used to be or how they got radiated to look like that, but yeah, stay away from them.
We got that from...
So I think just on the grounds of its story, its concept, how engaging that was and remains, the visual design, the special system, and again, a little bit of trivia. What was the original system? It had a very silly name.
Was it Earps? Is it GURPS? Yeah, it was borrowing a different system.
And the creator of GURPS saw a prototype of Fallout and hated it because it was really, really violent. And GURPS was created to sort of give designers a bit of freedom to not have to make violent games. And so they couldn't use GURPS anymore.
And so they knocked up special instead. But anyway, all of those things have endured and they continue to inform really popular and sometimes quite good games. So I just don't think I can throw it in jail on those grounds.
I think I was just playing too many annoyingly freeform games at once. And so I will fall down in the case of the defense for Fallout as well.
Good. Good. Yeah.
I think despite all the many allowances I was making for it, you know, the times that doors broke because I'd exploded a guy next to them or... Ian was cut in half by a laser beam yet again.
Ian's the perfect name for him, isn't it as well? Slightly hapless.
So ordinary. And he's found himself in the middle of this battle between power armored supermen and literal super mutants.
You got this, Ian? Yes. Oh, yeah.
Should do. Should be all right. Poor Ian.
OK, then. Well, that's yet another game, almost inevitably, that gets a pass in 90s Gamescore and joins the Pantheon alongside System Shock 2 and Blade Runner of the kind of the Mount Mushwall of 90s PC Gaming. So we'll be back next month with our next episode.
That's going to be Jeremy.
XCOM.
XCOM. Julian Gollop's XCOM. Why didn't he go for that like Sid Meier's Civilization?
Why isn't it Julian Gollop's XCOM?
I've met Julian Gollop and I don't think he has the ego for it, honestly. He's quite a polite, nice man. He's sort of got a sort of school teacher vibe to him.
He's sort of your favorite unassuming teacher, is Julian Gollop. So yeah, he wouldn't do that.
Well, I very much look forward to playing his game and coming up with some reviewer's material based around it. So yeah, tune in for that one. That will be out in Feb towards the end of the month.
But until then, of course, you can just binge on these episodes and just get the numbers up for us. That would be cool, wouldn't it?
Yeah, you can hear my Christmas anecdotes all over again.
Christmas with Jeremy. Relive it only on The Back Page Podcast. Yeah, thank you very much for listening.
Do feel free to leave us your thoughts on the Discord. Good or bad, we are open to ideas. And in fact, we earmarked one that we will actually introduce in future episodes because it was so good and it captured our imaginations and it features my name in it, so I liked it.
So stay tuned for that one. But until then, have a wonderful day, morning, evening, whatever time of day it is for you. And we'll catch you in the next one.
Bye.
Technically, this is another thing that I've heard, and I'm just parroting. Technically, it's apparently not an isometric perspective.
I'm sick of hearing this, Phil. It's not useful to anyone, is it, when people say, oh, it's not really isometric.
It's like a pop quiz, but Trev, you're like, did you know that? It's not actually an isometric perspective. No, it's just something to say in it if you're doing a podcast.
Phil's the silence.
These dogs are, sorry, I'm going to have to go and sort out these dogs because they're woofing. Someone's rung the doorbell and they're ruining the audio. So I'll be one sec.
I didn't hear any woofs at all, but yeah.
Sorry, I've ruined it. It will be picked up on my mic actually, so one sec.
You've got a nice little impromptu rendition of that. I don't want to set the world on fire there for you, so enjoy that in the edit.
