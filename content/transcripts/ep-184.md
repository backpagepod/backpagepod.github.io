Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, this is a very serious election special episode. I don't want to sort of break the reality of it too much before we get started, but how are you doing? How's your weekend been so far?
It's good. I went to Green Street Butchers and had a chicken sandwich.
Fuck yeah.
Green Street Butchers, is that the closest bath house to the beef of Chicago?
I would say, because it's only like two 20-something boys making sandwiches and they don't seem that stressed out. I think the one who's actually like making sandwiches seems a little bit like, he's under duress because he's got like eight different sort of meat baguettes at once or whatever, but I don't think it's got the vibe of the bear massively. Am I off there?
But the product is similar to the original beef shop, which is like a nice roll, some nice meat and some nice fillings, like it's quite basic. So that's probably why I'm making the connection. I went in there yesterday and there was quite a queue because there was a load of German tourists ahead of us and there was some confusion in the language barrier.
And that's probably the most, I've seen it like the bear.
Right, okay. I think those boys would probably like it to be like the bear. I imagine they sort of lean into it.
I don't know, I could see them looking at each other, giving like side eye and kind of like, what the fuck? We don't know what we're doing. We don't know how to deal with this customer who we can't communicate with, which I was surprised by because they only do like four things.
You just point, right?
Yeah, that's it. You just need, maybe they need like a sort of cousin Richie figure to go in and go, hey, asshole, this is, you know, this is chicken, this is pork. Which one do you want, basically?
Yeah, I think I'm going there enough that I could be a guest, like, side star, you know?
Which of the bear characters do you think you have the most energy of? I was gonna say the uncle who kind of owns it. I think that's kind of like most Matthew Castle vibe out of the lot.
Am I wrong there?
Oh, he's too successful. Um, if anything, like, I've got more of that kind of techy, better-cool-soul.
What's his name? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Bob Odenkirk.
Bob Odenkirk, yeah. That's funny. What, just a shitty, shitty sort of uncle character or whatever he is in that, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Like that.
Oh, I don't care who I am as long as I'm not one of those fucking, like, comedy workmen slash janitors.
Oh, have you seen the episode five? Is that what this is a reference to, Matthew?
It is, yeah. I'm not wild about that family of characters. They're not my favorite part of the show.
Yeah, in general, I think the takes here around the Bear season three's been pretty fucking dreadful.
I don't want to get us into bear takes on this, what should be a celebratory episode.
Yeah, I sort of like, where are you out of season three so far, I think it's between season one and two quality-wise, which is absolutely fine.
I'd say it's more season one, which I think I liked less than other people, but I was really on board with season two. I think it's a bit meandering. It sort of lacks the clear, like, what's the ticking clock here that the other seasons kind of had?
Like, this place is going to implode, we've got to open this restaurant, and now it's a little bit like, and? Now what happens? But I am enjoying it, like, it's very, very watchable.
Don't get me wrong.
I guess so, but the thrust of this season is they've got to make the restaurant a success for the first time, right? It's not like the shop's going to implode, rather, and then the second one's like, we've got to open this thing again in a countdown. Surely at some point the bear has to be about actually running a restaurant, or, you know, is it just not about anything?
Yeah, that is true. But I just think there was like a, almost like a sort of, certainly the second season, almost like a thriller element of like, are they going to do this? You know, are they going to pass this inspection?
Are they going to da-da-da-da-da? And I just haven't felt those individual stakes. Just lots of nice sort of character work.
If anything, it's a bit of like a kind of a breathe out after season two, you know?
Yeah, I think they also just couldn't really do the season two thing again, where it's like deconstructing a different character every episode, or they go off and have their own little adventure. That kind of like, I don't think you can keep doing that, you sort of, at some point it does need to be about the thing it's about again, as nice as they were. But yeah, I think, yeah, I think I'm not quite as good as season two.
Season two was just, was pretty amazing, but I don't know, I think it is like a bit of a good hang show now. You sort of acclimatize the characters a little bit more. Which of the characters are my Matthew out of that lot, do you think?
Well, I think we have a lot of similar energy.
So we're both Bob Odenkirk. That's devastating.
Well, I'd say you're more Oliver Platt than I am, because you've got your shit together. You're a little bit better organized.
What are we talking about? You own a house? I think that's very impressive.
Well, I'm thinking in terms of this podcast, you do most of the organizing and admin, so I kind of think of you as more grown up. Maybe you're the sister.
Yeah, fair enough. I am heavily pregnant at the moment.
Yes, I'm as that too. None of us are the cool chefs.
No, we're not, sadly. But yeah, such is the way of things.
It's a terrible advert for being a chef. It makes it just look horrible.
And that's the thing that gets me when they're just cutting up bits of grapefruit and then they're just like, ah, fuck. And then they just have to take a little time out while they stop bleeding. Any job where you have to factor in clotting time, I think, is a problematic job.
Yeah. I was very stressed out in this season by the notion of them changing their menu every single day. That was like, that's…
Well, that's what… Isn't that what Gordon Menu Jones does?
Gordon Menu Jones.
What do they call it?
Gordon Menu Jones. Gordon… That's what they call it.
They call me Gordon Menu Jones because I have to do so many fucking menus.
Look, if Gordon's listening and he wants to sling us some vouchers, that is something we would absolutely sell out for, actually. Fine dining in Bar's greatest restaurant. Absolutely.
I suppose, I don't… Is it every day or is it like every week? I assumed he had like a menu for a week or something.
I'm not sure. I think he does riff every day. Or maybe he has some regular things, but I think the pitch is that you never know what you're going to get and that might just be like a PR line.
Well, no one's ever had enough money to go there two days in a row to find out. That's a problem. So it's not like it's that easy to know, you know?
A couple of times I've been there, there's always been other people there who are closer to regulars. But by the way, like the chef talks to them. And I'm always incredibly jealous thinking like, man, imagine being so well off that you could eat here enough to have this kind of relationship with this cool chef guy.
Yeah, I mean, just for context for the listeners, this is not like a 40 pound steak place or something. This is like a 200 pound plus like, you know, yeah, like tasting menu and like seven courses and like a load of wine that goes along with it. It's a very, very fancy place.
I've been there twice ever. How about you? You've been there twice as well?
I've been there three times.
Yeah, but it's an amazing place when you do get to go. It's like it's just but yeah, it's just such a fancy undertaking. What were we talking about?
Ask in podcasting, isn't it?
Well, I dragged us into the bear by talking about the chicken rolls at Green Street Butchers.
It's available on Saturdays as well.
Yeah.
Interesting. Well, that's a game changer as well. I'll be heading over there.
I've not been to my beloved Taylor's Bagels for a while. So yeah, that's that's tough. I've got to reacquaint myself with the sandwiches of Bath, but it will happen at some point, Matthew.
So this episode, The Back Page: Election Special. There's an election going on. There's two elections going on.
Well, probably more. It's done. Yeah, it's done.
By the time you're listening to this, I assume that Keir Starmer's, you know, prime minister, rather than going into the real sort of like election and how we feel about it, because it's basically just quite depressing to talk about that stuff. And you sort of you just look on social media, people discussing it all the time. This is some nonsense, basically.
And it's quite funny to do this actually after that absolute car crash of a US presidential debate. And you're sort of like, it's like, it's that whole thing of like, can you satirize reality in any way when reality is just so preposterous? And this won't be weirder than that debate.
That's the thing. Like it just, it won't be weirder or more cursed in that debate.
Watching Joe Biden stumble through that debate had big me energy in a draft when I've just picked a game I haven't played and I'm just like, and hoping that you'll step in and tell everyone why it's good.
That has happened a few times and then I lose, I lose that draft and then I'm very angry about it. That's happened a few times as well. So yeah, so basically me and Matthew are going to run for prime minister of the United Kingdom.
But wait, we need to establish the context first. So the premise is, and bear with us here, and let me just explain up front, we know this is nonsense. Okay, if you think this sounds like bullshit, and you want to turn off and come back when we've got coherent thoughts on video games, or you know, like sort of a certain year, a certain era of video games, or that sort of thing, that's absolutely fine, because we're entering the bullshit chamber here.
So getting out of the way straight away. The premise then. The boundaries between our reality and that of the video game universe have shattered.
Faced with the choice of Tories, Diet Tories or unelectable liberals to steer us through this unprecedented crisis, the people of the United Kingdom have turned to two of the country's most celebrated video game executives, Pick and Mix Baron Matthew Castle of Matthew Castle Productions and Samuel Roberts of Big Sammy Holdings to appoint a cabinet from these adjacent universes and steer us into a bright new future. Okay, basically, we're building like a cabinet of video game characters. That's what's happening here.
So it's kind of like a draft. We'll do it in. We'll go through, I would say, like the 15 key cabinet roles.
There are also some sort of like bullshit ones on the side that we you're like, I don't know. I don't really know what the point of this is. Is that fair, Matthew?
Did you look at?
Yeah, I'd say some of the 15 were a little tight, where I was like, have I got? Have I really got a joke for like Minister for Leveling Up?
I had a really good one for that. But then I had to move my one for that to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We'll come to that anyway.
But yes, it was the one I struggle with was the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. I was like, that was quite hard. So yes, basically, we're running against each other to be Prime Minister.
And yeah, that's essentially the deal with this episode. It's very silly and it's all for fun. And just to be clear, we don't think this is real satire.
Like we're not, you know, no, definitely not. Matthew, anything else you want to say about the premise of this before we get into it?
I think it will all become clear as we do it. I think you'll know pretty immediately whether or not this is for you.
Yeah, I think so. Within the next 60 seconds, probably. OK, so Matthew, why should people vote for each of us?
Like maybe give a little spiel about what kind of candidate you are. Then I'll do the same.
OK, I wrote a tiny little speech. It's not really a speech. It's just because I thought I wouldn't be able to do it off the cuff.
Fair.
So here we go. It's only short. If you know one thing about Matthew Castle Productions, it's that we're currently being sued by Randy Newman for dropping him 60 feet inside a Lamborghini.
And I own that. I do. But if you know a second thing, I hope it's that we're not scared to inject some razzle dazzle back into proceedings.
Britain has become defined by its timidity, both at home and on the world stage. I'm going to get us back on track. I'm going to rub Britain in the world's face and I'm going to make outlandish promises that will teach us all to be dreamers again.
Am I really going to give us all free pick and mix in eternal life? Probably not. But we're going to have fun trying.
I mean, you know, well done, just great stuff. I mean, I don't actually have a speech, so I just...
I just... I have notes. I can't really boil it down into a slogan.
Fair enough. So, yeah, you know, so I'm Samuel Roberts, you know, just introducing myself in case you weren't aware of who I am, you know, just to appeal to some of the older crowd out there. I went to the School of Hard Knocks.
I went to the University of Common Sense. That's my way of saying I don't have an actual degree. So, you know, but I know people like that.
My whole thing, right, is I'm harsh but fair. I'm left leaning, but I chuck in a bit of right-wing policy sometimes for some spice, you know, just sort of like cheeky bit of like, oh, didn't realize you do that sort of thing. That's my way of keeping old people who have been driven completely insane onside, while also like keeping sort of Twitter liberals in my pocket.
So that's the sort of candidate you're getting with me. When it comes to navigating like the sort of landscape of video game characters, I would say I'm sort of uniquely placed as a man who, you know, has had many parasocial relationships with Final Fantasy women. So like, I just, I'm the guy for this job.
And so if you want like more Godhand in schools, then vote for me. That's so there you go, Matthew, that was powerful. Yeah, thank you.
So yeah, so we've got, we've each got five signature policies as well here. So these each have, I would say a video game element and also like a British element to them as well. So you know, trying to like address both sides of the equation of how we how we get elected, and how we navigate this crisis, these these collapsing boundaries between realities.
So Matthew, do you want to go with your first signature policy?
Did I understand the brief? Let's find out.
Okay, I look forward to it.
My first policy is I'm going to ban thin crevices that you slide through while the game loads.
Very good.
All gaps in games have to be at least the width of a Sainsbury's trolley and games must include an interactive Sainsbury's trolley next to every gap in order to prove it.
Okay, my government will ban the use of loudspeakers to play music in public with a penalty of a 10 grand fine. We will also invest the money accumulated from this fine back into the creation of immersive sims. Thank you very much.
Oh nice. That's Jeremy Peel's vote.
That's what I'm going for. I'm going for like the PC heads in the Discord I guess. What's your second policy, Matthew?
That's a dangerous group to try and pander to. In order to release a video game in Britain, the game must feature at least 10 minutes set in Britain. Or if this is not possible, if it's set in a fantasy universe or an apocalyptic future where heaven forbid Britain no longer exists, you must include a 10 minute Alan Bennett monologue about what Britain was like.
Okay, very good. I sort of, I'm along with that. I'm a board for the riders, you know, I respect you as a candidate for trying to force British culture on people.
That's good.
Yes.
Okay, my second policy, private education. I'm going to sort of do it Kirstama here. We're going to tax the fuck out of that.
So it's basically out of the reach of anyone normal. So proper 200% tax on that basically. So some of the funds will be invested back into education, but some will be invested into green lighting Shenmue 4.
So cultivating the Sega vote there. Yeah, that's what I'll be doing with private education funds.
You're really, really working on our Discord.
Yeah, absolutely.
I have to remind you, Discord is not the world. I know it may feel like it is, but it isn't.
I mean, thanks for pointing that out. I'll let you know that. But those are the questions for Fiona Brees to ask.
I'm going to embed ambassadors from the British food industry into every game studio across the globe, conducting a charm offensive to replace existing health items in games with local delicacies. Sonic the Hedgehog could collect hundreds of Cornish pasties, say, while Mario headbots a block and out pops a frayed bentos pie.
Okay, good. I like the idea of that uniquely cursed. Some might say that could just be a mod, but still, I like the idea of forcing it onto game publishers.
I don't care how they do it, how they achieve this. This is just… I am, you know.
These are a little bit. I realize this doubling down on all this British stuff does sound a bit faragey. That isn't the intention.
Okay, alright, so my third policy, very simple. Nationalized utilities, nationalized GTA. Thank you.
At last. At last someone's saying it. You come across as having a much better understanding of what policies people might actually suggest.
Mine show I clearly haven't engaged with this election.
Yours are like, how do I sort of force British stuff into some cute computer games? Which I like as well.
Yeah, well, that thing continues with policy number four. Every platforming game must use the London Underground tube announcer to say, please mind the gap, every time there's a hold to jump over.
That's good, I like that. That's decent. It would ruin some games, but still, that's fine.
Okay, policy four, we will dissolve the House of Lords. We will instead found the House of Shit Lords. It will be filled with video game villains and anti-heroes, including the Hot Evil Mum from Final Fantasy 16 and Ganondorf.
The Hot Evil Mum.
House of Shit Lords, it's on the ballot, so yeah.
My final policy is British video game history will be a compulsory lesson in schools, replacing PE. For the final exam, you have to beat your teacher at Worms 1 on the Amiga. Best out of three, no airstrikes.
I've got Ash on the board. Ash Day is firmly voting for me.
All right, so all land belonging to the Crown will be sold off. We will invest some of it in affordable housing, but most of it will go on making God Hand part of the curriculum. So yeah, that's going to be my signature policy.
I'd say the meat of your policies are taxed rich in various ways to fund incredibly cult video games that only you and ten other people like.
I mean, what do you think this podcast is, Matthew? I mean, that's why we're here, isn't it? But you're also all basically like, I've smuggled British food into iconic video games.
Imagine playing Jedi Survivor. There's a Sainsbury's trolley there. Can anyone say that's a net gain?
I just like that. I do like that. I think if you strip away our policies, they do reveal some of our genuine beliefs in terms of, I think you're more of a class warrior, and I'm just absolutely paranoid about how little the world thinks of us.
That's interesting, yeah. I mean, maybe I'm not thinking enough about the global stage here. Will green lighting, shown before, improve relationships with Japan or worsen them?
I don't know. I'm not sure what the stance is on that on the world stage, so you've kind of nailed it there. But I don't really want to nationalise GTA.
I just keep thinking about that nationalised sausages thing, and I just thought, how do I tap into that, basically? I don't want people to think I'm just a mad left-wing psychopath. It's not quite that bad.
It's all for the purposes of podcast-related entertainment, so just what you want to say when you're running for election, so yes. OK, good. So we've got some audience questions here, Matthew.
We've not seen these beforehand, but we've got three each to read out. Would you like to read the first one that you've received from the electorate?
Yeah, so you've got a picture. This is a kind of a public debate. These are people standing up to read these questions, is that right?
Yeah, absolutely.
Thanks to the two candidates for taking the time to deal with the collapse of the boundaries between universes. I own a model train shop in Rotherham. Matthew Castle, do you have any responses to the leak of photos taken at Gamescom 2023 in Germany where you look genuinely unwell after eating a kilo of sausage?
Is there a chance you could die in office if such an event repeats itself? All the best, Colin Norrington.
And your response, Matthew Castle?
It is true. I'm not in the best shape. But I have been given a clean bill of health by my doctor, Dr Mario.
So, you know, if you trust him, then you can trust me. And, you know, sausages. I also like British sausages.
I can eat lots of those. And also, I agree with re-nationalized or nationalized sausages.
Okay, good. All right. You want to buy your sausages directly from the government.
Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Good response. I think you handled that one well, Matthew. My next one, then.
Okay. I'm a lecturer in advanced bow ties and cravats at Eton College, but occasionally dabble in political science. With many populist leaders flirting with tactics of past dictators, how can the public trust Samuel Roberts will protect our democratic process, given that he has a track record of harassing voters in draft polls just because they didn't like his clearly inferior draft picks?
That's from Toffrey Wellington III at Eton College. What I will say about this is I believe in accountability, you know? And like the difference between that vote in the Discord and this vote is that was a public vote.
That information was publicly available. And so I believe that the voters need to be as accountable as the people they're voting for, you know? That's the key thing.
And I will also just add on to that. If you ignore the bulk of 20-pick draft just to pick some We Shop Channel music, you should go to hell. Thank you very much.
So really, is your argument that the only thing protecting the voters from you is the fact that it is a private vote?
I mean, I'm just saying it's part of it, you know, but it is what it is. It is what it is. Yeah.
It's time for question two from the electorate for you, Matthew.
This is for the right honourable Matthew Castle. I think the right stuff is slower than watching the space race play out in real time. I think Hotel Dusk is worse than Midsummer Murders.
I think Rob Morrow in Northern Exposure should northern fuck off. And I think Gino should be in the next Smash Brothers. Knowing this, do I still have a place in your vision of the United Kingdom?
That's from Susan Bottleford. Susan, I can see what you're trying to do. You're trying to get under my skin, but I'm a leader for all people.
Though I should note that later on when I climb into my ministerial car, my mic is left on and everyone hears me call you an incredibly bigoted woman.
That's good. And then someone chucks an egg at you. And other Blair-era artifacts.
OK, I think you handled that one well, Matthew. OK, question two for me from the electorate. I have a question for Samuel Roberts.
Times are tight and I'm often left to make difficult budgetary decisions. Do I have a Pret a Monge for lunch or is that money better spent subscribing to Disney Plus so I can enjoy the, I hope, thrilling conclusion to the acolyte? Had a good episode this week, I must say.
With that in mind, how are we to put this country's delicate finances in the hands of a man who openly boasts on air about his rich salmon diet and who spent several hundred pounds on a busted Sega Saturn and a replica Mech Cockpit that now sits gathering dust in a cupboard? That's from Ginrod in Basingstoke. OK, thanks Ginrod.
I mean, what I will say is that those are, salmon is not a wealthy person's diet. That is, that has been openly misconstrued by Matthew Castle, who has, it costs, basically costs the same as pork. But Matthew, because Matthew only eats takeout chicken burgers, like he can't even conceive of the idea of making fish.
And like that's like, that's beyond him as a concept. The only fish he eats is inside batter. He will not consume fish served in any other way.
Do you have a response to that Matthew Castle?
Listen, we've already talked about my diet. You cannot stand there and say, all I eat is massive giant sausages in Germany, and then also say that I only exist on a chicken diet. Those two things don't make any sense.
I refuse to engage in that question.
That's your German diet, and this is like your UK diet. That's what I'm saying. It's like burgers in the UK, sausages in Germany, exclusively.
I feel like I've answered the question.
And so as to the other one about wasting money, that was like my private finances. What I can say is, unlike some of the politicians in this country, I will not expense my Sega Saturn and other comedy purchases. They will be paid for by me out of my Prime Minister's salary.
So you've got nothing to worry about. And the things you should be worried about are scandals on the side, basically. Being on the take from the House of Shitlords to a point in new peerage, basically.
It's like Waluigi wants in and I take 10 grand on the side. That's the sort of thing you should be worried about. So yes, that's where the Sega Saturn money will be coming from.
So good. What's the third question from the electorate for you, Matthew?
Hi Matthew. Since you're known as the closer for all the magazines you had shuttered, do you have any plans to do the same with the United Kingdom? That's from Harold Goethebedt Windsor train station.
PS. I'm the man who stole Matthew's PSP in 2006. It contained a UMD copy of Wild Things with Matt Dillon and Denise Richards, five low res JPEGs of a selection of TV detectives like Colombo and Jonathan Creek, and one Randy Newman album, not the Toy Story soundtrack.
That's weirdly specific. Well, I say first of all, I forgive you for stealing that, because I'm a reasonable person, and I hope that you enjoyed Wild Things UMD as much as I did, which was a lot. In terms of do I plan to close it?
Listen. No one can predict the future. That isn't what we're here to do.
Will I close down the UK? Will I be the last Prime Minister of the United Kingdom? As I said in my opening speech, will we have fun finding out?
Will we have fun in those final days? Will it be like last days of Rome? Hell yes, of course it will.
It will be brilliant fun. So let's just go with it.
I thought you were going to say last days of Endgamer then, but then you said Rome and...
Well, last days of Rome and Endgamer are kind of interchangeable.
Okay, third and final question for me from the electorate. Now, I was raised by my dear mum to never judge a book by its cover, and I swear I don't. I have no problems with the way you look or present yourself, but what I don't understand is why you appear to be photoshopped into every picture your campaign uploads to social media.
Who are you trying to fool by inserting yourself into pictures of trendy young people enjoying themselves at work events and day trips? What kind of psyops are you trying to pull on the British public? Also, is that your son in the strange picture inside the tent?
Why won't you acknowledge your secret family? That's from Gammon Jones and Swindon. Okay, well, okay.
First of all, look, you know, there are rumours that I am an AI candidate. You know, there's big sort of like John Henry Eden in Fallout 3 vibes. To those rumours, I can only say beep.
So, you know, I just, yeah, I can't help you there. As for like trendy young people, I think what Gammon is referring to are my former colleagues at Frontier who are between 7 to 3 years younger than me. And I wouldn't call them trendy young people.
They're just slightly younger dweebs. You know, I just, well, they are. They're like my dweebs, you know.
So that's important. So, you know, and as for the little boy in the photograph, there's a reason we don't talk about him. That's only like one of my secret families anyway.
I've got like five more, you know. So I openly, you know, I openly, I discussed that. I just think, you know, I'm a big like wife guy.
And so I'm like, I'm going to collect wives. That's my, that's my stance on this. So yeah, I hope that answers the question for you, Gammon.
Thank you.
Okay, good. Why are you saying thank you? It was Gammon Jones question, Matthew.
I am Gammon.
Okay, good. Right, okay. So that's the campaigning out of the way.
I hope you enjoyed that segment.
Which way are people currently leaning?
I think it's like, yeah, it's like 3% for me, 3% for you and 94% for reform. So it's going well, I would say. Good stuff.
Okay, Matthew, let's take a quick break and we'll come back with Assembling the Cabinet.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, in this section, we're going to be assembling our cabinets. The goal is to build a robust cabinet and lead the United Kingdom into a bold new age.
Note, we're not including the Secretaries for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in these tentative cabinets to minimize offense. We don't want to generate any sort of like, I don't want to be like, oh yeah, my secretary for Scotland is going to be the guy from Still Wakes the Deep, you know what I mean? Or like the head of the Renwick in Still Wakes the Deep.
It doesn't seem, that would seem suboptimal. There's also some bullshit House of Lords leader gig I sliced out because who cares? We'll bring them off in the New World anyway, as mentioned with the House of Shit Lords.
I mean, I will, Matthew won't. That's my signature policy. Okay, so we've got a whole bunch of categories here.
Matthew, do you want to read them out actually?
Yes. I mean, they are just, I mean, spoiler alert, these are just official positions in a cabinet. They're not like hilarious game positions.
Yeah, there's not like CEO of like light guns or whatever.
Yeah, so we're trying to appoint a Deputy Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, Secretary of State for Leveling Up Housing in Communities. You laughing yet? Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Secretary of State for Work and Benchans, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Minister for Women Inequalities, Secretary of State for Education, Secretary of State for Transport and Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.
Yeah, okay, so we're going to basically appoint video game characters to fill all of these positions and then you vote for the winner in the, the poll will be in the announcements channel on Discord so you can vote there. And yes, may the best candidate win, both uniquely cursed. Like do you want shopping trolleys in Jedi Survivor?
Or do you want your kids to learn about Gene in God Hand? It's up to the public basically, but I think like appointing these sort of cabinets will basically give people an idea of what our governments will look like and where we might fall politically, Matthew. So do you want to do a coin flip, Matthew?
Because we decided we're going to do this, not like a normal draft because it's just too disparate to keep track of, I think. No one will be able to pay attention to like all the different categories if we're jumping around. So we're going to do it in that order.
We're going to do Matthew's Deputy Prime Minister, then my Deputy Prime Minister, basically. So, yes, that's sort of...
And then alternate, so different people, yeah.
Yeah, so whoever goes first in the first one, they go second in the next one, and then we, yeah, et cetera.
So what do you want, heads or tails?
Tails.
Oh, tails it is.
Okay, I guess it doesn't really matter if I go first or second, does it? Okay, all right, I will go first then. So, category one, Deputy Prime Minister, how do we get to this point with a podcast?
I'm going to go with Isabel from Animal Crossing.
Interesting.
Yeah, but yes, a dog is my Deputy Prime Minister, but she's very accomplished at sort of like town management. I think we can apply that to the UK as you have a careful hand or paw, I guess. Do they have hands on Animal Crossing?
I guess they do, because they have to like pick the letters. They have to have like opposable thumbs, right? Otherwise, how do they pick stuff up?
So, yeah, Isabel, just really, really rational. She's sort of like keeping the whole thing afloat in the last two Animal Crossing games. She's just sort of like, she'll help you with town development.
So I think she'll bring a bit of that to the UK. Replenish some of these areas that are just like, you know, a town where it's like a Betfred and then like 90 abandoned storefronts. We're going to try and like replenish those.
So now it's just going to be a Betfred and a Pear Tree?
And a Nookington Junction.
Yeah.
So I'm going to put a dog in charge of doing that. Thank you, British public. Thoughts, Matthew?
I kind of get it. Like, she is sensible. The thing I worry about is, so for any international listeners to this, we have prime minister's questions every week where the prime minister and the leader of the opposition kind of go at it.
But if one of them is away, then the deputy prime minister and the deputy leader of the opposition stand up and do it. And I don't know if Isabel has got the kind of aggression to dominate in that kind of environment. She's a little bit too nice for politics.
That's my only concern.
Well, I guess you're going to be the opposition. So it's just going to be Isabel the dog arguing with you. Prime minister's question.
Well, no, she'd be arguing with my deputy who I'm about to pick. So let's bear that in mind. Picture Isabel is going to have to go up against Kazuma Kiryu as my deputy prime minister.
He's incredibly loyal.
Does he speak English, though?
Well, yeah, because he's been localized.
He's been badly dubbed with like Mark Hamill or whatever.
He's been dubbed by... No, he's the one. It's that...
So, okay. So, Yong Yeh arguing with Isabel from Animal Crossing, who's probably communicating... Yeah, okay.
But Kiryu, incredibly loyal. He's scary enough to keep the party in line in the way that I'm not so I can kind of give him or, you know, I'm the kind of fun, I'm like a fun boss. That's my whole vibe.
So, I've got a deputy who's scary as shit. And like former Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, he's not afraid to punch a dickhead in the face.
Who was it who John Prescott punched again?
Just some prick, just some rant, like a member of the public.
It was a guy through the egg at him, wasn't it? Yeah. Remember what big deal people made of that?
And then it's like...
Oh, that's good though. It's good that he punched that guy.
I think it was good too. Sometimes you just got to resort to physical violence. That's another policy of my government.
And Matthews, apparently. He's like... Are you going to have...
Are you suggesting that you're going to get Kiyu to beat the shit out of Isabel from Animal Crossing? Is that okay?
No. No, I'm just saying that he's out on the street and one of your party supporters or a form voter comes up and starts giving us some grief. I wouldn't be upset if he picked up a traffic cone and smashed it over their head.
Good to know. All right. That's very wise.
Who is your Chancellor of the Exchequer, Category 2, Matthew?
My Chancellor of Exchequer in control of the country's finances is Agent 47 because he comes with his own briefcase. And also, who better to trust the balance of the books than an incredibly efficient freelancer? I rest my case.
All right. That's not bad. It's not bad.
So, for my Chancellor of Exchequer, I'm going down the Animal Crossing route again here.
Oh, my God. How many fucking animals are in your cabinet?
Well, you know, wait and see, I say. But Tom Nook, I mean, this is a guy who, again, he'll slap you with a mortgage, but he knows about finance and balancing the books. He is the guy for it.
I mean, no offense, but Agent 47 is who I hire if I want someone to throw a hammer at an asshole, not basically revitalizing the country. I'm just not sure how Agent 47 is going to do that. But Tom Nook, there's like documented evidence of him turning tiny businesses into huge businesses, you know, sort of like getting you on the property ladder.
This is a guy who's got like, you know, slightly twisted morals, but he knows how to get the job done. He's not corrupt. He's down the line.
He knows about finance. Tom Nook, it is. I think he's a stellar pick.
So yes, two animals so far, got a raccoon and a dog in my cabin.
Your cabin office is going to stink of animals.
They're very hygienic. They are not like wild creatures. They're little cartoon sort of lads, aren't they?
They're fine. Anyway, okay. I just like, you've got all these very masculine sort of like assassin characters and like a man who, again, I don't think speaks English, is your deputy prime minister.
I don't think that's going to work out.
This is a fantasy world. I think people will be more on board with a human who doesn't speak their language to two animals that do speak their language. Well, they also don't really speak their language.
They speak in kind of weird sort of burping bleeps.
I think, again, I know who I'd vote for, but that's just me. Okay, Foreign Secretary Matthew is category three. So I'm voting.
It's me first here, isn't it? So I'm going to go with Nuclear Gandhi from Sid Meier Civilization 5. Someone who will do the sort of hard negotiating, build good relationships, but isn't afraid to be like, you know, I will drop a nuke on you if you mess around with me.
I think that's what Nuclear Gandhi is going to bring to the table. So very excited to have him on board. So we've got two animals, a Nuclear Gandhi.
Thank you very much to United Kingdom. Thoughts on that, Matthew?
I think that sends all the wrong messages to people who, you know, they're all there at the G7, who rocks up Nuclear Gandhi. He's got Nuclear in his name. Like that instantly puts me like in red alert mode.
I think this is a time for like de-escalating things, not escalating them. The Gandhi bit, you're like, oh, you know, he's all right. But I think the Nuclear is going to, it's just going to, it's going to spook people.
All right. I mean, you know, I disagree. I think that, you know, Tom Nook and Isabel, they may be like, fool you into thinking this like a soft government and then Nuclear Gandhi shows we're not messing around.
And I will argue that Nuclear Gandhi is still better than David Cameron at this job. So that's my, that's my take, Matthews. Who have you got for Foreign Secretary?
My Foreign Secretary is Paul McCartney from Beatles Rock Band.
I think I say Destiny.
Well, I mean, the Destiny, I was going to pick the, his Paul McCartney's Tune in as Destiny as my sort of party anthem at my conference. I think hope for the future is a very positive message. Paul McCartney, because everyone loves the Beatles.
It's got real star power. You know, that's what we need at the moment. You want to get Britain invited to all these international events.
Who better to do it than by having Paul McCartney as your foreign secretary? Because you're like, well, I just want to meet Paul McCartney. Like, I've got to invite them.
We've got to play nice with them. It's just the power of a star. Also, have you heard him on podcasts?
He's just nice. He's just a really nice, good energy.
What if someone says to you, do you want to meet Paul McCartney? And then a 360 era render of Paul McCartney shows up. And then while you know that there's a real Paul McCartney in our world, who is not this individual.
What's your take on that?
The thing is, yes, but also a 360 render of like any era Beatles Paul McCartney. So whatever your favorite era of the Beatles is, he can be it. Like if you met Paul McCartney as he is now, like he's quite an old man and he's quite far from how he was in his heyday.
This is the Paul McCartney you want to meet. This is the Paul McCartney you remembered. Is he a little low res?
Does he look like he's come out of a Pixar film? Yes, that is undeniable. But I think you'd squint and be happy to be meeting like, oh, it's Yellow Submarine, Paul McCartney or whatever.
I think it'd be a bit like, oh, I've sort of got Tom Cruise here and then it's just a guy with like quite big teeth who's been hired off of like some impressionist sort of website.
No, not at all, because crucially he's got the songs and he's got the voice.
Okay, well, you could have gone for real Paul McCartney from Destiny. He sort of floats in sort of like mid-air kind of thing, but you know, it's fine.
I don't consider him a character in Destiny.
I guess that is true. Okay, good. We've got the visage of Paul McCartney as your foreign secretary versus Nuclear Gandhi.
Yeah, Gandhi with his finger on the button. Yeah, but yours is also a poorly rendered Gandhi.
He mostly appears in like illustration form, but yeah, that is true actually. Yes, but then I never claimed he was the real Gandhi. You're going around claiming that this is the real Paul McCartney.
I'm just claiming it's a snapshot of a real Paul McCartney. It has more in common with the real Paul McCartney than Nuclear Gandhi has with Gandhi.
But like I'm saying that this is the only Gandhi you can meet, whereas there is an existing Paul McCartney. And I'm saying that having this 360 render of Paul McCartney clashes with that. It's a very cursed, like kind of like alternate version.
I think it's the idea of sending 360 era Paul McCartney to meet like Vladimir Putin. Is that going to work out? I mean, do we think that's like good?
I'm just not sure.
Back in the USSR.
I mean, you've got me there. That's like one thing he can do.
So, put you inside. This is fun.
Let's move on to the next one then. Putin's like, this is fun. Oh dear, if we didn't like the comment.
I'm going to step away from my nuclear button, which I wouldn't have done if you'd sent a man whose first name is nuclear.
I'm glad I voted for him. He's just a man at home who's walking past a shopping trolley in Jedi Survivor. All right, so we come to Home Secretary, fourth category, where you pick first, Matthew.
Yes, keeping our streets safe. It's got to be Batman.
Oh, that's a good one. I like that. I wasn't expecting that.
Would Batman ever go legit like this and sign up to be part of a cabin? You know, vigilante is baked into his character. I would say yes.
Yeah, I think he would. I don't really know what you'd do for the borders, but that's kind of like, I don't know, that's a bit bleak to talk about, isn't it?
Yeah, I didn't even want to go near that, to be honest. So that's fine, that makes it too real, and we want to avoid that at all costs. So Batman it is, very good.
Okay, I would say that the problem with Batman is that, you know, he is Bruce Wayne, he's a billionaire, he's out of touch with regular people and their concerns. And again, you know, says Mr. Salmon. School of high Mr. Salmon.
He spends four pounds on fish. Okay, I would say he's out of touch, but then, you know, that's just me. I went to the University of Common Sense.
So what can I say?
He gave that lad in the tenement that gadget in Batman Begins?
Yeah, one lad, I suppose he did. Did he ever really tackle the sort of problems with inequality, though? He gave to that one orphanage that Joseph Gordon Levitt went to.
Then he ran out of money. And that was kind of it. But spent loads of money on tanks and stuff.
You know what I mean?
Like, it's just I don't think we should get too hung up on the past. It's about what we're going to do.
Yeah, Batman's new position as Home Secretary of Britain.
Well, I'm interested to see who you pick and whether they can protect us from the Joker.
Yeah, okay. So my pick is Miles Edgeworth from The Eight Attorney Series.
No, Joker's killing that guy. Joker's got a good track record at killing DAs.
I will point out to the electorate, there is no history of the Joker in the United Kingdom. That is not a documented concern. That is a made up concern.
I am focusing on real world issues here. The people who tend to be the Home Secretary tend to have a law degree or whatever. That tends to be the basis of what they are going for.
Miles Edgeworth, he is strict, but he has got a good sense of justice. He is hot, so we will get the first vote as well. People will be going for that.
So I am honestly surprised you didn't take Miles Edgeworth. Matthew, that feels like the sort of thing you would do. But Miles Edgeworth or Batman, you decide.
So a very normal vote here. Yes, category five, Secretary of Defense. I am picking Kane from Command and Conquer.
Again, it goes in line with my tough but fair approach to things. He is like a master strategist, basically. He is exactly who you want to deal with, the defense side of things.
He is sort of like, you know, he has navigated all kinds of GDI and Nod related military quandaries. He is great with quotes as well. He who controls the past commands the future.
He who commands the future conquers the past. I mean, you know, that's someone you want on your side, in my opinion.
I think that's too confusing for the man on the street. If you say that, if you put that on the side of a bus and drive it through freaking Basingstoke, people are going to be like, what? What does he mean?
That doesn't make any sense.
He's also one vision, one purpose. The rivers will flow with the blood of those who oppose us.
Oh no, that's just not going to fly in Basingstoke. It doesn't even have a river.
Oh my god. I mean, I think this is a killer choice. Kane is like an all-timer defence secretary pick.
I just, it's like, I think this is a faultless choice. I did think about Yuri from Red Alert 2, but he's got too many sort of like cursed, campy, psychic vibes and I just don't think people are going to go for that. So yes, I think meanwhile, next to like a dog and a raccoon, Kane just sends the right message I think.
He does, finally, like finally there's like a bit of danger and authority in the room. I'm not going to lie, you know, I'm looking along, I'm like, dog, raccoon, and I'm like Kane from Come On and Conquer, yeah, okay, fair play to him.
Yeah, nuclear Gandhi and Miles Edgeworth, that's like, we're building a killer line up here. It's just that mixture of like the soft and the serious that makes a good cabinet I think. Who's your Secretary of Defense, Matthew?
Well, it's funny that you picked Kane from Come On and Conquer because I've picked Premier Shidenko, aka Tim Curry from Red Alert 3.
Okay, the guy who shouts SPACE.
Yeah, and I basically picked him because he shouted SPACE and that was funny and, you know, got to have a bit of memes going on in his cabinet.
Isn't he Stalin's mate, that guy?
Oh, I don't even know the specifics of his character.
It's Soviet Union character, isn't it?
Yeah, and he was fleeing to space at the end. That's where he was going to escape to because it all went to shit for him. But for the meat of the campaign, I feel like there he is.
He's leading things. He's giving you instructions. It's more about having a trusty leader who can inspire others.
I think for the most part of that campaign, he does. Military is a tough thing because everyone's a little down on it. Especially, you know, young people don't really like the military.
They're all very sort of anti that. And that makes sense. But that's why having like a bit of a meme lord in the mix, I think, is going to play well on Twitter, you know?
I'd just like to point out that I think Stalin is a bad hang. Thank you, British public. Woke slamming Stalin.
Did you go with that line of attack, Matthew? The woke mobs are trying to cancel Stalin. Classic woke mobs.
Okay, so it's just a man, it's just a gif of a man shouting space, basically.
Well, it's this whole character, it's the whole package, it's not just that one moment. I'm not saying our Secretary of Defense is five seconds of the looping of Premier Shidenko. That isn't the line.
Okay.
It is him, it's the full package. It's his military victories, it is his eventual escape to space. We will have to bring him down from space to join the cabinet, but that's fine.
I'm sure we'll find 360 Paul McCartney on the line. I'm sure we'll want to come back.
The thing is, because it comes from the same universe as Kane, I feel like, not that they're going to cancel each other out, but I think people are going to feel as confident in either of those guys.
Kane is iconic in a sort of genuine sense, whereas the Tim Curry character is iconic in a meme sense. So I guess that's the squaring off people have to do in their heads there. So, category six, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.
Matthew, it's your turn to pick first. Who have you got?
Easy. Professor Hojo from Final Fantasy VII.
He was my pick as well. Yes!
Yes!
This is a guy, so we were both going to have the guy who experiments on human beings and like fucks them up. We were both going to do that and oh my god, okay.
But also, he seems to be the key scientific mind of his time. Yes, he's put that intelligence to the use of evil and the development of evil, but you can't help but look at all the science fiction elements of the Final Fantasy 7 universe and think a lot of this is pretty cool. Like these giant guns, the kind of airships, everything.
It's all him. It's all Hojo. Like the man is like an endless idea generator.
I just think he needs to be pointed in a slightly healthier direction. I'm not going to say that he doesn't need like really close management. And he's definitely like very risky in this cabinet.
Like there's, you know, every morning I'm waking up going like, has the Guardian got an expose that Hojo's been fucking injecting cells into soldiers again or something. But I will take that responsibility. I will micromanage the shit out of Hojo.
Just what I want is a man who is building armoured dolphins in your sort of like defence department, and then a man who experiments on humans in another, I mean, like, what a combo that is. The United Kingdom is doomed, I believe.
You were going to pick him yourself!
I was, yeah. But you know, now I haven't. That's what you do in politics, isn't it?
You're like, oh, you did the thing I was going to do, but I didn't get to do. So fuck you. Basically, that's how we do things in the United Kingdom these days.
So yes. Okay, good. I wonder what Paul McCartney would make of Hojo as like a, you know, like a vegetarian and stuff.
But, you know, that's what could I say?
We don't know that Hojo is not vegetarian.
But a lot of his experimentations have like meat energy to them.
Yeah, but he's not there licking his lips looking at them, you know?
No, that's you. That's your job as the Prime Minister. All right, good.
My Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology. I'm going to go for Rosalind Lutece from Bioshock Infinite. So we need somebody who can manage the sort of relationship between our reality and the newly adjacent video game realities.
And this is someone who like literally does that, just sort of like mega brain physicists basically. So that's what we're going for. It's a bit more of a serious pick than Hojo, I'll be honest.
This has got big Tory energy. A rift opens up, a load of fictional characters come through the rift, and then they get to work trying to close the rift. So will the other fictional characters pull the ladder up after them?
That's classic conservative behavior. Is that a thing they do?
They're just like, only we can go into the other universe? I think they're the ones who get Booker to go into the other one. You know what?
Barsher Convince is really confusing. The Luters. I just think you need some sort of brain boxes here.
The idea of the Luters as being more reprehensible than fucking Hojo is just nonsense, so I'm not having that. We'll simply move on to category seven, Secretary of State for Leveling Up Housing and Communities. It's my turn to pick first, Matthew.
Yeah. We're going with Hell House from Final Fantasy VII.
You're going to put a house in charge of housing? Yes.
Who knows better than an actual house? That's what I say.
A hell house? It's like the nuclear gandy. You're focusing on the second part of the names.
Wait until you get to my Secretary of State for Transport, my friend. It's not Choo Choo Charles, but it's along the same lines. A hell house?
A house with arms and legs. If you fuck around, it'll kick off. I need someone who can deal with the housing crisis.
Experience of being on the inside. Literally, the inside of a house. Hell house it is.
I think this is a great choice, Matthew. Who have you got for this?
I just can't believe that you're… The pitch to the man on the street, but don't worry. We've sorted out housing for you, but it's this living house that like sporadically sprays fire out of every window and then flies around dropping ice on people.
It's just, no one wants to live there, you know? And certainly no one wants a hell house built in their backyard.
They don't need to live there. They just need to be in charge of houses, that's all.
But it's the only house he knows how to build is other hell houses.
But you know, the general shape of the house is perfectly fine. Very liveable. It's a kind of affordable housing.
We really need to pull the United Kingdom out of its death spiral with housing.
Well, I'm going to build some nice houses, some actual enviable houses. I'm going to get Hudson from Breath of the World and Tears of the Kingdom, the head of the Hudson construction company. It does mean we have to have all these idiot sons holding up those signs all over the land.
And I know that you don't like those.
Fuck those guys. That has immediately made the United Kingdom a worse place to live.
That's physics problems. That's fun. Those are fun little side tasks, fun little distractions, you know, when you're walking around like the new forest and you meet a guy and you have to hop up.
Anyway, I like it. I think that's nice. Hudson, I really like his houses in Breath of the World and Tears of the Kingdom.
I like the design of them. I like the color of them. I like the kind of modular design that seems very efficient for like building at scale.
So you know what I hear? I hear Matthew Castle wants you to live in a fucking shipping container because that's what all those houses are basically. They are not.
They've got windows.
That is true. But they're like their vibe is shipping container I would say, like the colors, the style. It's sort of like it's prefab housing.
It's like when beautiful old houses in Bath like built next to like very cursed looking sort of 70s things, you know.
If you hadn't abandoned Tears of the Kingdom, you'd know that eventually much later in the game you get to build your own Hudson mansion. And actually it's very, very nice. I'm very taken with it.
So like I think the Hudson model scales up, you know. Your first time buying a big in-house shipping container, you've got like a family, then you can build out your own modular dream house.
Hell House guarantees a house in that style for you, day one, straight on the property ladder. It's all for you. Like let's do this.
Hell House.
Yeah, but then you get home from work, you're really tired, you've had a long day at work. And, oh, where's your house? It's not on the ground.
Oh, because it's in the phase of the boss fight where it flies around in the air, spraying down lightning on people. You've got to wait for it to stop doing all that bullshit. Like if you haven't got a character who's got the opposite magic attack for it, you're basically fucked.
You just have to wait for it to do that for hours.
I've been to like places in London where it's like a load of shipping containers with like bars and them and little novelty shops. And I'm just saying that's not the future, dog.
That is still better than a living evil house.
I don't know, man. It's a house though, isn't it? It's a house.
You know, it's...
I've got to draw a line somewhere.
You do, yeah. Okay, so moving on then to category eight. Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.
It's your turn to pick first, Matthew.
Dr. Kawashima.
Oh, okay. Interesting. Is that a medical doctor?
I don't know.
We don't know. We know that he's a neurological doctor, isn't he? He's like a neuroscientist.
So he's going to be probably, you would hope, quite good on mental health, which is good. We already have a very good 3D model of his head, if we need to make quick videos with him or whatever. If there's another outbreak, it's very easy to beam Dr. Kawashima, rather than Chris Whitty or whatever his name was, very easy to quickly render out an update from him, project him in the streets.
Older people and boomers are already very familiar with him from his popular DS games. They're going to feel quite comfortable with this guy. I just think he's not maybe like an electric personality, but you're going to feel safe and comfortable with him.
Yeah, OK, so we've basically got a sort of DS render of a head that may or may not be a real doctor in charge of all of health and social care.
We've got the render of the head should we need it. He is a real man. I think he's still alive.
Let's hope so. If he's not Hojo, probably give him a bit of magic.
Just like a meat monster with 3D Kawashima's head.
That's exactly what I was thinking, so cursed. Great addition to your cabinet, Matthew. No notes there.
OK, I'm going to go with Tei Takemi from Persona 5, aka the Hot Doctor, who sometimes injects you with random shit to give you a bit of a boost.
I think, again, a trained doctor just needs a bit of spice to the cabinet. We've got the mums excited with Edgeworth, we've got the dads excited with Tei. I think it's going to work out well and is a doctor and actually deals in medicine, whereas with Kawashima we can't really be sure.
And again, we're not sure if he's alive or not. That's also a difficult thing to unpick.
It's like famously a struck-off doctor.
Yeah, but she's just misunderstood. That's what we do in the United Kingdom. We rehabilitate cursed, misunderstood people who should not be rehabilitated.
So that's what we stand for in this country.
That is part of our national character.
Okay, good. We move on then to our category nine, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. So I'm first here, aren't I?
So this is the one I struggle with the most, right? And so I thought, I'll go with someone who really understands the value of resources, gathering resources, collecting, like, accumulating wealth over a long period of time. Someone who really understands that.
And that's why I'm going with Minecraft Steve. I have no further notes. What about you, Matthew?
I'm going with, you see, I focus more on work and the idea of like, who would inspire industry and...
Yeah, Minecraft Steve. Yeah, perfect.
Yeah, well, Minecraft Steve, I'm not gonna lie, that's a pretty sound choice. He's about as far from nuclear gandy as you get, also like brand recognition, good for your cabinet. Like, I feel like you've got tomorrow's voters on board, because they're all like, oh, it's Minecraft.
They'll just click on anything in Minecraft, won't they?
Exactly.
Kids. So I'm picking, yeah, but likewise, I want to inspire industry and show what kind of effective working looks like. That's why I have signed a swarm of Pikmin to be my Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.
The thing is, though, Pikmin lack leadership. They don't have their own sort of like, you know, will to do things.
Well, that's why I'm here to give them instructions. I set them to work. I'm like, get all the steel mills back up running and I send them off to do it.
You come back and they've all been eaten by like a badger or something and that's tough.
Maybe, but that's for me to worry about, not for you to worry about. Pikmin. Benefits of the Pikmin.
If they ever get fired or if there's a cabinet reshuffle, it's really funny to see loads of Pikmin walking along that road down the street with all the journalists going, hey, Pikmin, why are you going in there? Is there going to be a reshuffle? And like 20 individual Pikmin looking sort of sheepish or kind of covering up their faces with pieces of paper.
Even I can't deny that's delightful.
With Pikmin in there, I can then get Hojo set to work, reverse engineering whatever that yellow juice is that they drink that makes them work like crazy motherfuckers. And then I can just give that to the British public. So that's good.
And like, look what it did for the Pikmin. It can do this for you. The only downside that I am willing to acknowledge is that as we get into winter and the nights get longer, they will spend less time working and more time in their pods trying to avoid predators.
That's the downside with the Pikmin is the daylight hours, isn't it?
I mean, I would argue there are multiple downsides that they could like I said, it could be eaten. They have no autonomy. So you basically have to tell them to do everything.
Therefore you are basically your own work and pensions minister because they can't do anything except collect stuff, which is like I know I'm a master delegator. I mean, you can't be a master delegator if you're telling them what to do on every single thing. Like that's you.
You're micromanaging at that point, aren't you?
Imagine I'm all over. I've got my cursor. I put the cursor over the Department of Work and Pensions and I just say, go there and do it.
I just press A once. They all run in the front door. A big timer appears over the Department for Work and Pensions.
When it's completed, there's no unemployment and everyone's got a good pension.
Yeah. I think it's more likely going to play out like this. It's going to be question time.
And then Fiona Bruce can be like Prime Minister.
Prime Ministers are never on question time, but anyway, whatever.
That is true, actually. So I guess like a leadership debate, how do you respond to, you know, sort of like claims that your Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has spent the last three days collecting strawberries? Like, how will you respond to that?
I'm like, yeah, and I'm here to announce giant strawberries for everyone.
But they're not giant, because the Pikmin are small. Those are regular sized strawberries.
Oh, right. I'm like, all right, everyone, a strawberry for everyone.
One small strawberry.
Come to London, enjoy the fruits of their labour, literal fruits of their labour.
I mean, I guess like she'll ask the same question to them when they appear on question time, like a bundle of Pikmin. A Pikmin, how do you respond to claims that you're being eaten and that all you do is collect fruit and they'll just like sort of like sheepishly sit there? That's kind of like...
Or they'll just sit there going, oh, and then people be like, oh, adorable. They are adorable.
I think they'll just be commandeered by someone else and they'll no longer be your Pikmin. They'll be Fiona Bruce's Pikmin. That's what I think will happen there.
Okay, lots to think about there. All right, so category 10, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero. It's your turn to pick first, Matthew.
Yeah, definitely the department I understand the least. All I know is we're trying to work towards net zero. We're trying to find the most efficient ways of generating energy.
I propose why employ a cabinet minister who's going to search for the solution when we could employ a cabinet minister who is the solution. It's a Voltorb. We just plug him in, let him cook.
Oh no, I've got Pikachu for this category. I did think about Rufus Shiro, then I thought his history on energy security is actually pretty grim. Weapons coming out of the ocean and reactors blowing up and all that stuff.
He's not quite the one. We've both got Pokemon here. I've got Pikachu.
I would say only one of those Pokemon could explode at any time and it's not Pikachu. Just pointing that out that Pikachu might be a more solid pick here. How do you respond to claims that your Energy Security Net Zero Secretary might explode at any moment, Matthew?
I mean, any of us might explode at any moment, right?
Well answered. Okay, next up then, Secretary of State for Business and Trade. I'm first here, aren't I?
Okay, I'm going to go with Huang Li from GTA Chinatown Wars.
No, that's what I had.
Well, you have to find someone else.
Terrible choice.
This is a guy who really understands supply and demand from his time in the drug trade and in GTA Chinatown Wars. We have someone who understands business in the rawest, most basic sense. I just think that's a great choice for this kind of role.
Just somebody who can really sort out the budget deficit and all that sort of thing. So, despite his criminal past, we're willing to look aside on that one and welcome him into this government. I think it's going to be a good time.
What does that do for you, Matthew? Do you need more time to figure someone else out?
I mean, in an alternate universe, maybe he would have been on my cabinet. In this universe, I'm frankly shocked that you would put a known drug dealer in charge of all business and trade. Yeah, you are going to get slammed so hard by the right wing press and I know fuck those guys but you are and that is just it's going to make your your whole period in power incredibly arduous.
That's yeah, but but they will love they will love nuclear Gandhi so much because of his like get shit done attitude in government. That's exactly the kind of like thing that the tabloids have been waiting for.
So yeah, you really think you can buy the loyalty of the Daily Mail with a with a nuclear Gandhi that they won't mind that you've put a person who's just a drug dealer like that the whole character is drug dealer.
I think it will be I think it will balance out you know and it's sort of like yeah it's sort of like it's bold. We believe in reform here you know and like you know let's face it let's be honest GTA Chinatown Wars made selling drugs seem really fun so like is that not on the game developers?
Yes that's that's true okay I'm gonna pick from Cyberpunk 2077 Saburo Arasaka pre-being murdered by his son at the end of the first act.
This guy's a bad hang.
Is he a bad hang? He's just the head he's the head of one of the most powerful corporations in whatever universe that game is set in. Gleaming towers for all, giant skyscrapers.
Listen he'll have to do he knows business he's risen to the top we just have to stop him from getting assassinated.
Yeah but you know my guy knows how to like sell crack at a five dollar increase on investment you know what I mean like it's I'm just saying I'm just saying okay I've got a feeling that we're gonna have the same pick for category 12 Minister for Women Inequalities who have you got Matthew?
I've got Bayonetta.
Fucking hell I have as well why are we so fucking predictable Bayonetta what's wrong with us? Bayonetta! It's like we named the one woman you can think of for fuck's sake.
Well I could think of I was just sicky in terms of like I didn't want to have a princess that's what I was sure about princess bitch and princess elder I think it's a bad look.
Oh my god this that's big like millennial men try and think of what feminism looks like and the best we could do is Bayonetta. Fucking hell.
That's on fucking video games.
You know what it is to some extent but I still can't believe we've both got Bayonetta for this category oh my god oh that's so funny. You know do you want to explain more about Bayonetta?
You basically like you'll pick you'll largely the pool you have to pick from are damsels in distress or like snarky teenage girls there's a lot of those. Bayonetta strong female role model also could probably do some good side work for like defense with her combat abilities and her hair. Yeah I mean I really didn't think much more beyond that I did think oh I won't say with the alternatives but.
Well I mean I will say again you know if we're talking about the Daily Mail I mean are they going to go for a candidate whose hair comes off sometimes and forms big monsters I don't think they'll want a minister who does that. I mean just think of all the grief they gave Angela Rayner for dressing like a normal woman do you know what I mean?
Yes but also you forget that the Daily Mail has a strand of horniness to it because it always has like those pictures of celebrities and their bikinis and everything like it understands that it's core readership dads of a certain age like to stare at flesh also like this is like a like a legitimate way of that happening.
I just don't I don't see how that's going to happen I think it's going to be like a lot of like I don't know I feel like there's a lot of JK Rowling tweets in the future about Bayonetta you know what I mean like it's I could just see that coming so uh okay all right um okay well so I'm going to take a female renegade commander shepherd from Mass Effect we're just going to have someone who sort of like won't get messed around you know Jennifer Hale voice incredibly charismatic a great all-rounder but isn't afraid to go fucking ape shit if if needed to um to get the job done on their women equalities I think just like an iconic uh player created um version of a sort of like uh yeah of a of an rpg character so um yeah and her clothes don't come off um you know like randomly um when like a it forms like a big dog or something so just pointing that out was like an upside so yeah Yeah. Okay. 13, we're nearly at the end.
Secretary of State for Education. I'm going with Headmaster Sid from Final Fantasy VIII. This is a guy who, again, he has run a school, fucking big school as well, a school for teenagers who go to war.
That is a guy who's really been in the thick of it on education. And there's some spotty things in his record. Some might say the cafeteria in Garden shouldn't have had, Balamb Garden shouldn't have had hot dogs on the menu, and that that is not nutritious for teenagers.
That's spotty, I'll agree.
Oh, Jamie Oliver's gonna drag you over the coals for that one.
Yeah, well, whatever. I'll just close more of his restaurants in response. Headmaster said, or got a hot wife as well, Sorceress Edia.
So, bit of that, bit of danger there. But I think in general, Headmaster said it's got a pudgy, dweeby energy that people will really go for. He wears a little jump waistcoat thing.
I think he's gonna go down well. And also, I didn't find there were that many good teachers in video games. And I didn't want to pick one of the horny ones from Fire Emblem.
So, here we are, Matthew, who've you got?
Oh, well, I have leaned into the horny teacher cliche. I've gone from your homeroom teacher from Persona 5, Sadao Kawakami. Very compassionate, very understanding of a protagonist's troubled criminal path.
She's a solid teacher. I do have to say up front, she does masquerade as a sexy maid on the side. And that is an expose waiting to happen.
Yeah, that is a ticking time bomb, my friend.
Yeah, but I feel like the teacher, in isolation, and this is what we're really gonna double down on in our messaging, on the teacher side, she gets the job done, she understands the students, she's really loved by the students. And like the maid thing is, it's just like a side hustle, that's okay, we encourage that in this, not specifically the maid thing, but like, you gotta do what you gotta do, right? We won't judge you in the castle administration.
Well, look, I would say that there are certain boundaries that need to be maintained, and if you're dressing as a sexy maid for your own students, I would say that it makes you untenable in the British government. Again, Daily Mail can have a field day. You know, sexy dads, sorry, sexy dads, I meant to say, horny dads, horny dads, they'll be into it.
But, again, exactly.
That's tomorrow's headline sorted. Just your picture and sexy dads, an explanation of.
You got a problem with sexy dads, Matthew? Do you like discriminate against sexy dads? Like, what's your response to that?
No, I love them.
There you go. That's tomorrow's headline sorted. Sexy dads, I love them, Matthew Castle.
Okay, good. Yeah, so I think that's a very curse. She called Becky when she's in her maid costume too.
Again, these are salacious details that people will really go for, I think.
We live in the post-shame world. I think in a place where it's very likely to mix. Not in the United Kingdom.
In a world where the next president of the United States is likely to be someone who had an affair with a porn star. I don't think someone who is good at education also being a maid on the side is really going to trouble people.
This is the United Kingdom. And what we do here is laud it over people for bullshit morality reasons. It's not going to fly here.
People are not sex-positive here. They're button-down, sad people who are hoarding houses from younger generations. They have no time for Becky.
Well, a vote for Matthew Castle Productions is a vote for sex-positivity for Becky, for Bayonetta. I think that's the only women on my board.
Amazing. Okay, so we come to Secretary of State for Transport. You're first, Matthew.
What do you got?
I picked Sid from Final Fantasy VII.
What, because he has an airship?
Yeah.
Okay, anything else to add?
No. Airships. Just we're gonna have airships.
Airships are gonna be a thing.
All right, fair enough, yeah. I did think about doing some kind of portal thing for transport, but I couldn't quite figure it out. I didn't wanna put Wheatley in charge of transport, you know what I mean?
I mean, originally, what I had written down was, the guy who says, ride the shoe puff.
That would have been great, actually. I think that would have won you this. That would have been the We Shop Channel music pick.
I'm above gimmicky picks, you see, so I went for something legit. And all I know is that travel in Final Fantasy Rebirth is just very quick, much quicker than it is in real life. I just light a little fire, he's there with the plane.
If he can instill that kind of efficiency in our rail system, I am all for it.
I'm above gimmicky picks as the man who has a horde of Pikmin as his work in pension secretary. Okay, good. All right, so my pick then is Doom Train from Final Fantasy VIII.
It's an actual train. He's always on time. Perfect, but again, it's very much the Hell House philosophy here of it is the thing that it's doing, therefore Doom Train is right to be transport secretary, Matthew.
So, and let's face it, the trains couldn't be any worse in the United Kingdom. So I think why not have a punt on a train tackling it themselves? Thank you.
Okay, last category. Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. So I'm first here.
I'm gonna take Sander Cohen from Bioshock.
An artist, a very controversial artist, but an artist nonetheless, just someone who really has a grip on culture. And just like, again, some might say he only went mad because he had to go underwater and live in a city. And then maybe we don't talk too much about the morphing human beings into sculptures kind of thing.
That's a little bit controversial, but you know, this is a guy who's basically like, he is behind one of the most beautiful, amazing dystopias that has ever existed in video games. So controversial figure, but just think again, you need a bit of a fire brand in that culture position, Matthew. Thoughts?
And what sports does he excel at or is interested in? That's what I wanna know.
Unclear, but we're going more down the culture route anyway. I'd be curious to see who you get here, if you go for like Michael Owen from Michael Owen's like World League Soccer or whatever. But I mean, I would say that culture is the foundation of the UK and it's the thing we gotta focus on the most because we're not looking after our TV and film industries in the way that we should.
And I think a psychopath like Sander Cohen is really gonna turn things around.
Interesting.
Who have you got Matthew for this?
He may be Vanilla, but I had to get him in somewhere. I've picked Mario for this.
Oh, okay. I suppose he can do a lot, Mario.
He can do a lot. So, culture, Mario, paint, easy. Sports, Mario's played all the sports.
But is he good at any of them? And are any of them good?
I think he's always an all-rounder. He's always the all-rounder on the character select screen.
So, excels at nothing, interesting.
Well, but he's tried his hand at all sports. Like, he understands the basics of them. I think that's solid.
Media, slightly trickier. Does he have any television? Oh, he's been in a film.
That'll do.
Okay, fair enough. And so, with that, the Back Page: election special splutters to an end. And what an election it's been.
Like I say, vote on the Back Page: pod discord. You can find a link to that in our Twitter profile. Matthew, my question to you, was this good?
Thoughts?
I think it was about what I was expecting.
Landed right in the seven zone, where I was anticipating. Some might say it was never gonna top the comedy image we put out of the election with the slogan, whoever wins, you lose. That was pretty good.
Yeah, I would say, I think a lot of how this lands depends on what's happened in the real election, you see. Because if there's been some really funny outcomes and some real assholes have lost their seats, I think they'll be like a general good mood and that will kind of carry it. If it's all kind of gone horribly wrong or the bastards haven't been punished, then maybe people will be out for blood a bit more and will not look as kindly on it.
Yeah, fair enough, you know? And I'm willing to sort of commit this to history and see where it goes. I think we had some good novelty picks in there amongst like one or two actually good picks, which is kind of what you want in a draft like this.
I don't think it's the worst thing we've done.
No, it's like I would say it's in the RPG companions draft of like category of back page episodes, you know, just like should they have done this? Maybe not, but at least they went for it and they did properly go for it. They said hell house should be in charge of housing, you know, and like I'm willing to stand by that as a creative decision.
This is what the political debates need. They do the debate, it finishes, then the two candidates come forward and basically analyze the whole thing as we are. I think that would bring a lot of kind of like humility to it and, you know, just make some slightly more relatable.
Absolutely, yeah. So, you know, we've both got the future of Britain in mind, but only you can decide who gets to be prime minister.
Are we gonna read through our cabinets?
Oh, that's a good idea. Actually, we should do that. I wasn't trying to like end it because I wanted it to be over.
So category one, deputy prime minister. I had Isabel from Animal Crossing.
I've got Kazuma Kiryu.
Category two, chancellor of the Ishikawa. I've got Tom Nook from Animal Crossing.
I've got Agent 47 from Hitman.
Category three, foreign secretary. I've got nuclear Gandhi from Civ 5.
I've got Paul McCartney from Beta's Rock Band.
But not the actual Paul McCartney.
Oh yes, it is a version of the actual Paul McCartney.
Category four, home secretary. I've got Miles Edgeworth from the Ace Attorney series.
I've got Batman.
Category five, secretary of defense. I've got Kane from Command and Conquer.
I've got Premier Shidenko from Red Alert 3.
Category six, secretary of state for science, innovation and technology. I've got the Lutessers from Bioshock Infinite.
Professor Hojo from Final Fantasy 7.
Category seven, secretary of state for leveling up housing and communities. I've got Hell House from Final Fantasy 7.
I've got Hudson from Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the World.
Category eight, secretary of state for health and social care. I've got Tate Akimi from Persona 5.
I've got Dr. Kawashima from his famous video game series.
Category nine, secretary of state for work and pensions. I've got Minecraft Steve.
I've got a swarm of Pikmin.
Category 10, secretary of state for energy security and net zero. I've got Pikachu.
And I've got a Voltorb.
Category 11, secretary of state for business and trade. I've got Huang Li from GTA Chinatown Wars.
I've got Saburo Arasaka.
Category 12, minister for women and equalities. I've got Fem Shep from Mass Effect.
I've got Bayonetta.
Category 13, secretary of state for education. I've got Headmaster Sid from Final Fantasy 8.
I've got Sodeo Kawakami from Persona 5.
Category 14, secretary of state for transport. I've got Doom Train from Final Fantasy 8.
Sid from Final Fantasy 7.
Category 15, secretary of state for culture, media and sport. I've got Sander Cohen from Bioshock.
And I've got Mario. It's a him.
Reading that back actually did make me laugh. So I think this probably did achieve its goal of being mildly entertaining for a podcast episode, Matthew. But only the listeners could decide.
So vote on who wins. And yeah, we'll return for another draft pretty soon. And yeah, that was good fun, Matthew.
So coming up in July, in fact, we do have a draft coming up in July on the XL tier. So limited run games draft. We're basically gonna take our two companies, fictional companies, found versions of limited run.
You'll get a game, you'll get a comedy item to go with that game across 10 categories. Chaos will ensue. We'll name the like limited run style lines that we're launching as well.
There'll be all those kind of bullshit lore details. It's definitely a like hardcore apply only kind of podcast, unlike all the rest of them, which are very accessible, obviously. And we're also doing, we're doing like the best of what we've been watching so far for the XXL episode that month.
So you like the TV and film from this year. We'll summarize some of our favorites. So look forward to that.
Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
