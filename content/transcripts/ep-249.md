Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. You are now COVID-free, and back to your usual squawk, your words, not mine.
Yeah, I'd say it's 95% powered up.
Yeah, you know, I sort of, I've missed the OG Castle voice, you know? It's the voice that our listeners fell in love with. Not quite the right term, but you know.
So, I've been enchanted by it for almost five years now. And, you know, I'm glad to hear you're a little bit better. I had one observation for you about the episode we're doing today, which is the Games Set in Japan Hall of Fame.
A sort of semi-sequel to, early this year we did, Games Set in Britain and the Hall of Fame for that, off the back of Atomfall. This, I thought, would be really simple. And then ended up being about four or five hours of research for me, because I didn't just want to pick the most obvious thing.
So I was wondering if that was the experience you had, or, you know, have you found it a bit simpler than I have?
Well, maybe I accepted picking more obvious things, which will make for a weaker episode. It's quite a hard one to talk around returning Castle favorites. I didn't want to not include them, because some of them are just so perfect for this episode.
But it does mean that, yeah, you will be hearing some of the old favorites again.
I think that's inevitable, but I've definitely endeavored to chuck in, I would say four or five things that maybe we haven't talked about quite as much. So I think I'll mix it up a little bit. Matthew, one thing I want to do straight away, you know how I did that terrible shout out last week for Emily, the listener?
Oh yeah, where you said you were her husband, yeah.
Yeah, that was awkward. I listened back to it, I was tempted to fight it in the Discord and be like, well, I never said that from me, your husband, I never said those words, Matthew said that afterwards. So I listened back to it and I was like, nice.
You can see where I was coming from though, right? You can see that you said something very comprehensively and then you said, and that's from your husband.
Yes, but I didn't say from me, your husband, I said from my husband.
No, but I think I was well within my rights to point out that that sounded weird.
We're getting into sort of like Oliver Stone's JFK levels of forensic detail here.
Back and to the left.
I was about to say back and to the left, back and to the left, back and to the left. That's what he says about fucking 90 times that film.
Well, there you go. You won up to me by doing an actual impression. One again, one of your classic impressions.
People liked your Ben Starr impression more than me last week as well.
Oh, I bet that burned you up inside.
It killed me, to be honest. As the man who had been saying Ben Starr to myself non-stop for weeks and weeks, that killed me. But here was a man who actually caught COVID so he could do a better impression of Ben Starr than me.
Yeah, I can't do it now. All right.
I enjoyed that and that had a bit more of a panto kind of vibe about it.
That's what my voice is like now.
But anyway, I did want to do another shout out for a listener because I'm not going to do this every week. Although maybe I will sort of dabble with this, sort of a sort of in-joke for a while and see how it goes.
Dabble with kindness.
Yeah, that really sums up my relationship with kindness, really. There's that listener, Superboy in the Discord, did the Cardiff Half Marathon 2025, and credited the podcast for getting him through the training for it, which is ironic considering how lazy you and I are. His exact words as posted in the Anything Else channel in the Discord.
I managed this yesterday and there's a picture of the medal. I'm by no means a natural or keen runner, and this time last year I couldn't even run for five minutes. Reason I'm sharing this is the thing that made the training intolerable was listening to The Back Page Podcast.
I've pretty much spent the last year only letting myself listen to the podcast when I'm out training and looking forward to new episodes has been the key to getting me out the door most days. The community around it has kept my enthusiasm up too. For hints at stuff I'm still yet to reach and kept me going through the episodes and training plans.
It wouldn't be an overstatement to say it's made a huge difference to my health as someone with an energy limiting condition. Been a good year. Good pod and community this.
Cheers all, particularly our hosts. That's nice, isn't it?
That is good. I mean, ironically, he is definitely going to outlive this podcast now, because we'll both keel over. Well, I certainly will, imminently.
Well, he actually stepped on me going, and that's from me, your husband, at the end of it, which I think would have been a great bit. But that's okay. That was going to be the...
Wasted a... I could have been gold.
Yeah, that's it. But isn't it more Back Page Podcast to never do the joke, but explain the joke you were going to do? I would say it is.
Back and to the lift. Back and to the lift.
All right.
You can do a better Ben Starr than that, naturally. Go on. Go for it.
All right.
That's still really, really good, for fuck's sake. Matthew Castle is just one of those people who's naturally talented at loads of different things. Not sports, but intellectual things.
What sports? All right. You don't have to underline that.
Well, sorry. I mean, as far as I know, you're not a sports guy, but neither am I. Anyway, we should really get into the episode, Matthew.
So have one more aside here. There are two games we've been playing that are well worth talking about, I think, before we get to the next what we've been playing episode, which is all the way in the first week of November. So we've got a little wait until then.
I thought it's worth talking about them, Matthew. So I've been playing Ball X Pit or Ball Pit, however you want to say that out loud. And you've been playing Absolum.
So why don't you kick us off with this game? Because I bought it off the back of your recommendation already. It's waiting on my Steam Deck.
So yeah, kick us off.
Yeah. So this is a rogue-like beat-em-up. If you imagine the structure of Hades, except instead of an action RPG, it is a fantasy side-scrolling beat-em-up a la Golden Axe.
Actually, the thing it most resembles is Capcom's Chronicles of Mistara games.
Oh, yeah.
Which were like Golden Axe but with like a bit more kind of brain and, you know, a few more ideas to them. This even more so, you're basically trying to get to the top of a tower to fight some evil beast-y thing, and every time you die, you're back to the start. But it actually pairs really nicely with the beat-em-up genre, because as you go through the map, you're going through different locations, there are different bosses, different enemies.
And so the action, which could maybe be repetitive. If you just played Golden Axe through straight, in 20 unchanging loops, I think it would grind you down. But the fact that you're going to different locations, things change as you achieve certain things on certain paths, it can impact the map elsewhere.
Yeah, I think they've just really found a way of marrying the simple pleasures of walking right and biffing lots of fancy creatures. And that looping Hades thing where every time you're doing it, your builds are slightly different, your characters are slightly different, you're mixing and matching different powers and passives and upgrades. And you're also gradually getting more powerful because you're investing in the underlying skill tree thing that's there.
And I do love beat'em ups, but I always find them like a little finite in terms of, you know, once I've kind of made my way through it, it's like, well, that's that. And this, the change in the nature of the characters, I just think really brings it to life. And also just that it's, you know, technically outstanding as a beat'em up, like the combo system, just the feel of the attacks, the way that you and a co-op partner can string these absurd moves together and build up a combo chain that goes into the hundreds.
And you know, there's certain bosses that, you know, after doing like, you know, 15 or so loops, like me and Catherine could just absolutely monster, especially if we had the right upgrades dropped along the way. And it just, it's just so much fun, such a power fantasy to unleash that kind of power. So yeah, I think even if it didn't have the rogue-like thing going on, you know, just as a nuts and bolts beat'em up, it's like one of the better ones I've played.
Put that all together, it's just absolutely magic. And also like co-op, like being able to go through that process of like, you know, learn and adapt and evolve with another person, you know, that helps fill in some of the gaps as well. Because if you're ever bored of doing it, you know, at least you've got another person that you can kind of like, you know, chat shit with and, you know, it's not like those lonely runs of Hades where they go horribly wrong, where it's just you and the game and you feel a bit sour.
So yeah, I thought this was absolutely brilliant. Definitely on the Game of the Year list for sure.
Wow, that's a high praise. I mean, it's been a very good year for that side-scrolling kind of game generally, like with Intricate Combat, you know, there's been a few games in that vein. The co-op thing is very appealing.
Do you think it's less appealing if you're only playing it by yourself? Does it lose something if it's just a one-player experience?
I've not played it by myself. I'd say that, you know, the feel of it is still really nice. It's just that, you know, in those sort of rogue-like games, when a run is going really well, you know, it just all clicks into place and you feel so overpowered and it's just absolutely magic.
When there's two of you both having that experience at the same time, it's just amplified that little bit more. You know, the run where we finally, quote unquote, beat the game, we almost felt bad, the stuff we were doing, and, you know, up until that point we'd only ever got like halfway through the map and then suddenly on a run we just went from halfway from the map, you know, the furthest bit we've ever been to all the way to the end. And we just absolutely rinsed it, which is often the way, you know, that's what happened with me in Hades as well.
Like sometimes you just get the combination that works and sharing that with someone else is just really, really fun.
Very good, Matthew. Well, I will play it and we can discuss it in more detail when we come back to it in what we've been playing episode next month then and compare notes, see how I found it by myself and playing it on my Steam Deck in bed. I can't really see me convincing anyone to play this with me.
All the games I play at the moment in multiplayer are very PC-oriented like I'm deep into Darktide again at the moment, which I've actually just finally started to understand that game because it is a left for dead game at its core, in terms of it being a four-player FPS with hordes and hordes of zombie-like Warhammer 40,000 things running at you. I say things because I couldn't tell you what I'm actually fighting in that game. That's my level of knowledge of the 40k lore.
Unless it's on a computer game that I've done PR for. I know fucking nothing about the 40k universe really.
Nurglings.
It's got something like nine different progression systems, and basically one of our little group finally posted a big link to, here's how all these nine different progression systems actually work. I read it, and I ingested it. I was like, right, I think I finally understand why we're dying after like 10 minutes every single time we play this.
So now we're monstering that and having a good time with it. I play this giant man with a club called Thuddo, and I basically get health back by clubbing guys on the head with a billy club. It's good.
Is that what he's called or are you calling him that? Is that like a role playing thing you're doing?
No. Were my imagination so rich, Matthew, but-
To come up with Thuddo.
It's actually the name given to you by the game. It's confusing because Phil and Tom, who I play with, they've been given the names, one's called L-Buy and one's called either Crispy or Crispin, probably Crispin. I don't know which one's which because it doesn't say what the gamertag is.
I'll be like, I'll come res you Tom. Tom's like, I'm still alive. I'm like, oh, sorry, Phil, I'll come res you instead.
They know who I am because I'm the one giant man in it, and I'm Thuddo and I'm wearing all this very refined clothing, because I blew all my premium currency on these very fashionable clothes. So I need to learn who they are, but they know who I am. But yeah, it's not in my imagination or anything.
But yeah, basically, I think they've sorted that game out after like three years of trying it. It literally came out in 2022, and people just complained about it straight away, and they've been fixing it ever since. So you know, in that time, they probably could have made a new video game, but instead they've been working on this one.
So fair play.
Maybe I should spend my premium currency, which is the Patreon funds, on fashionable clothing.
What is the danger of that? Where would you go in Bath to buy fashionable clothing, Matthew?
Fat Face?
Charles Tootwit?
Marks and Spencers?
Marks and Spencers. There's also those shops in Bath that mysteriously only sell about eight clothes, but have a giant like retail space. And then you go in and look at the clothes and it's like one jacket, six thousand pounds.
So you're like, how does the economy of this shop possibly work out?
Yeah.
But anyway, Matthew, I thought I'd also talk about Ball X Pits here before we move on to the actual episode. So people might remember that on the XL episode we did on Games we were looking forward to for the rest of the year, which we did in the summer, during the last Steam Next Fest, there was a demo of this game, which is basically a mix of Vampire Survivors and I break out, I guess, a little bit of that to it. It's bouncing balls up these big rows of enemies that are moving towards you, and the balls are like projectiles, basically.
You're trying to clear out all these enemies before they get close to you and then damage you. When your health's done, your run is over and you have to start again. That's the very basics of it, but there's also a secondary layer of resource management and unlocking new characters that goes on.
So when you're in the actual ball x pit combat bits, you're collecting coins and leveling up your characters. So there's like a permanent sense of progression to go alongside this very Moorish spamming at enemies with all these different like ball attacks. When you level up, you buy new types of projectiles, like a fireball that you throw at someone, or like an ice ball.
And then even more interestingly, you start merging them. They start, or you start evolving them. So you start getting like a mixture of like a metal based power and a lightning based power that basically locks a hook into an enemy that you've hit, and then starts electrocuting them from there.
And so before you know it, vampire survivor style, you've got absolutely tons of shit flying out of you, and taking out enemies on the screen. And you keep going until you've basically beat the boss of that one level. And then in the meta progression layer, you collect these gears to unlock new levels.
And as you go, you unlock new types of characters as well. Like you have one character, for example, there's two characters combined, and you're controlling both their fields of firing balls basically. And the other ones have all these different kind of like powers that they come into the game with.
One might run faster than others, or might arrive with one power already unlocked, or something like that. So yeah, there's quite a lot to it.
Is there an old guy with stinky garlic breath?
With that Vampire Survivors thing?
That's Poe in Vampire Survivors.
Oh, you know, there's like an undead kind of mummy-ish type one.
Right.
There's a very cursed... There's a lot... They all look very cursed actually.
None of them look like normal guys having a good time. They all look a bit strange. They're sort of...
The mix of the two layers reminds me a little bit of Cult of the Lamb, which is another Devolver published game. Right. And I wonder if they took a tiny bit of inspiration in, you know, having this primary kind of like combat layer, and then another layer behind it that allows you to add a bit more personality, a bit more color, something else to do, something else to think about.
And I think the people who are the most cynical about this game with the demo, were wondering if that secondary layer might be a bit anemic and not very interesting, and might undermine the otherwise fun kind of like firing balls off in the main combat bits. But I quite like it. I think it actually quite smartly lays in the way that you can do resource management, so you can simplify it a bit.
What happens is, as you unlock characters, you spend your currency placing, let's say like a forest, let's say like a field of wheat, or like rocks down. And you need to fire your little characters at them during a harvest phase to harvest resources from those different things that you've placed on the map, basically. So you'll literally arc your little dudes to run across a wheat field, bounce off of a forest, bounce onto a rock, and then bounce into a building that you might have started but you haven't finished yet.
And then they'll bounce into it one by one until the building's finished. And as you go, you can make that phase longer and longer, you can expand how much space you actually have, so you can be running across more resource fields at once. You can place little farms and assign one of your dudes there, so you don't actually have to always harvest a certain resource.
You can be doing it kind of ambiently on the fly. And I think it's just engaging enough. What I'm curious about is the review embargo is going to lift tomorrow when we're recording this, is how much the repetition of doing the same few levels over and over again, which you will do a lot in this, much like Vampire Survivors will make a bit of a sliding scale in terms of critical reception.
Some people who are fine with that, some people who are less fine with that. But I will say that this has not been my primary game all week, and I've somehow managed to play like 10 hours of it just squeezing it in here and there. And it's had that sort of like, sort of like, bilateral thing of filling all the time that I can give it, you know?
So if I've got 45 minutes before bed, this is absolutely the game I'm playing. So it's out on Game Pass this week, I think it's out on Switch as well, Switch 2 versions further down the line. That personally would put me off buying it on Switch because I just feel like with the amount going on on screen, this is just a guess.
I just don't think the performance will be all that. That's my, you know, a complete speculation, but I would prefer to play on Switch 2 if I was playing on Steam Deck and it runs very well on there. So yeah, but I really, really like it.
And it's just as more as I was hoping it would be. The ways in which you improve as you go and the different types of combined powers you unlock makes it super exciting, Matthew.
I think I had the same, not concern, but like question hanging over it from playing the demo, which was just like, you know, what are the legs here? You know, how much does this like open up in the final version or do those extra characters or new ball types kind of really change things up? Like I felt like in the time that I played the demo, I'd seen a lot of combinations already and I didn't know if I'd sort of maxed out.
So I have exactly that same kind of anticipation for the reviews. I just want someone to come along and be like, oh, I've played this for 100 hours and like completely lost my mind to it. Just to give me an idea of like how big it is.
Yeah, I don't think they want people to play it for 100 hours. I think it, so in the review communications, they were like, we expect the game to take 30 hours to complete.
Oh, okay. So it has an end to it?
It does. I can see that. I've unlocked three of the levels and something like six of the, maybe it's four of the levels and then eight and ten of the different characters.
So, and you know, there's a, I'm still kind of like combining abilities for the first time and seeing what happens exactly. And, you know, just seeing these like crazy flashes of lightning and laser beams and stuff popping off and then like mincing through bosses who are really, really hard the first time. You can just feel the progression naturally moving along.
So it doesn't feel like every time that you start a new, you know, a new level that you've played before. It feels exactly the same. There's some optimizing going on both in the background and how you're playing it.
So, yeah, I don't, it's that thing of like, if people want it to be the Bellatro Forever game, I don't know if it will be that. I don't know if it even be as, have as much longevity as Vampire Survivors, but I definitely think it will suffice for the 30 hours that they say it's going to fill. And that's okay, I think, you know?
So yeah, okay, well, there you go. Two mini reviews of games that we've been playing. And then we move on to the meat of this week's episode, Matthew.
What ignited your own personal interest in Japan as a place and center of culture? Because yourself and Catherine, quite immersed, I would say, in Japanese culture more generally, like it's, you know, the arts at large, whether it's like literature, cinema. I've always described you as a high-end weeb, basically.
And I think that's kind of fair. But I wanted to know, I guess, like, what the origin point of that is.
High-end weeb? Probably like low-end weebary. You know, I think if you're a teenager in the West, you know, you're most likely to encounter anime and manga and maybe some cool action films.
Definitely seeing Ghibli films when I was a teenager up to like Kill Bill, very sort of formative years in terms of tastes and being interested in their Japan's cultural output. You know, I wasn't watching those things thinking, wow, that's Japan. Because obviously, like, I know Japan isn't like Princess Mononoke.
That would be fucking insane and terrifying. I recognize a sensibility at work here and, you know, it is noticeably different to, you know, what's coming out in the UK and Europe and America and reacting to that positively in some way. And then I feel like a lot of my appreciation for Japan is, it's all from, like, cultural output.
You know, I've spent very little time there. I've been on two press trips there and done very touristy things. You know, like, I would never pretend to have any kind of, you know, insight into what it is like to be or live in Japan.
Like you say, it's still high, you know, it's still weeb, you know, consumption. It's just a bit more high end in that it's less anime and manga and more literature and not art house cinema, but you know, adult dramatic cinema. You know, it's being really into the the Coriader films and, you know, through those which are very, like, slice of life.
I think you can come away with an idea of, like, you may think you know a country from its cultural output, which I guess is what I'm getting at. It's like, that's probably the mistake to make. When I, you know, fantasize or think about what it would be like to live in Japan, it's a weird version built from watching sad family dramas about disappointed fathers, but also really, really liking the houses that those dramas are playing out in and wanting to live in one of those.
I like the houses basically. It's quite hard to pinpoint why, like, where that obsession or interest comes from. You know, just culturally, so much of it resonates or seems aspirational.
Like, I like the heavy dose of quite sort of traditional order and, but again, that may be bogus. That may not be reflective of what life's actually like. That might just be, I've watched too many Ozu films and things have probably moved on a bit since the 1950s.
Yeah. What about war crimes? Where do you stand on those, Matthew?
Yeah, those are bad. Those are bad.
I'll give a clarify.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no worries.
Yeah, this is a bit of a later development for me to have any real interest in Japan. I would say that video games are a massive part of it. And I would say if like another, let's say randomly that Australia was where all the games that Japan made came from.
I would be as fascinated with Australia as I am with Japan. Because I think my first exposure to something that felt like purely Japanese and just not American and not British, which is the majority of what you ingest culturally, certainly in the UK in the 90s and noughties, was the Pokemon anime. And that was the first time I'd ever seen an anime.
It was the first time I'd ever been confronted with that particular style, those particular character designs and its particular sensibilities, whether it was just Brock getting bonked on the head for being horny, or the little sweat drop that would appear when someone was embarrassed. All this stuff that I just didn't understand, and I was like 11 when that started here, that stuff becomes more mainstream throughout the noughties, and I just have a slightly better grasp on, oh, okay, now I understand what anime is, now I understand what manga is, and then going from there really. But I would never really, a bit like you, I'd never claimed to have a really deep relationship with this stuff.
In some ways, going to Tokyo, I think highlighted how superficial my own understanding of Japanese culture was. I was curious, Matthew, if you can remember the first game you played, that had a significant Japanese setting, it was actually set in the real world, in the real place.
It's probably something like Onimusha, renting that on a PS2 at some point. I think the opening level of No One Lives Forever 2 is set in Japan, and it's set in quite a traditional Japanese town, lots of sliding wooden doors and little wooden noodle stands and all this kind of stuff. But I don't think I was like, what the fuck, what's this place?
I can't remember having a moment where suddenly all this stuff came alive. I mean, part of the appeal when you read about Shenmue or later Yakuza was that these games are like more so Yakuza than Shenmue. It was sold a little bit as like a Japanese GTA and that probably has more of an impact.
I remember that more clearly than anything else, but that's still like, whatever, 2005, 2006. It's quite late in the day. I don't think I was playing if there was a fighting game stage set in Japan on the Mega Drive or something.
I don't think I was looking at the background details and thinking like, wow, I'm in Japan.
Yeah, I was simply too young to even really think about this stuff. I was not very worldly. I grew up in Hampshire.
It is what it is, really. I think I isolated it down to, I would have played a demo for one of the Tenchu games on PS1, but I don't think I really thought about the setting. I did start to think about it a bit more deeply with Onimusha in 2002.
When I bought that game, I remember feeling like there's something so particular about this setting. I think it was the fact that I at some point must have just gone online and read, oh, there's no Banaka guy who is a real dude, and this Salmonosuke guy who fights him is not a real dude. That's quite an interesting way to use a real life historical figure and that kind of context and stuff.
So yeah, I would say that's probably the first time I ever thought about it. But I guess the interesting thing is definitely seeing this from a European perspective. I mean, I think we're in the peak fascination with Japanese culture right now, aren't we?
Like it's, you know, you just look at the Demon Slayer movie that came out this year and became like a runaway box office hit across the world. I mean, there's never been more interest in that kind of stuff, right?
Yeah, or the fact that you have major Western TV shows set either, you know, literally filmed in Tokyo like Tokyo Vice or Shogun, setting that, you know. Can you think of another Western show set not in America primarily? For a country to have two quite big breakout shows like that is definitely something's going on with that.
Yeah, I don't really keep an eye on the anime stuff, so I sort of forget that that's like sort of quietly massive and that there is like a generation, maybe a couple years younger than me, who are carrying that stuff through their life. Like my little brother, you know, he's only like four or five years younger than me. It feels like he'll be watching anime forever, you know, when he's like 80.
And I sort of forget that that is a thing now.
Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, just for context, that Demon Slayer movie made more at the box office than either Superman or Fantastic Four did this year.
What?
Yeah, $648 million. And so I think it was the highest grossing international film in the US ever. Surpassing a record held by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
And I mean, yeah, so this is now as big. It's just that I'm talking specifically about anime. It's just that I think if you're beyond Gen Z, you can't quite pass it in the same way.
That's not fair. If you're past millennial age, you can't quite pass it in the same way. And that's why I think you don't see many major media organizations talking about how big anime is or centering it in culture like they would send to something like Superman.
I think it's just because there is that gulf in understanding. But that will change as people get older.
I don't think Peter Bradshaw is reviewing Demon Slayer in The Guardian.
He's not a big Mugen train guy, that guy is he? As far as I know.
He isn't up there with the Mugen Ark.
Well then, I think that's a good note to get into it Matthew.
I mean, this is leftover from the plan I did for the British game Best, Worst or just the most iconic game set in Japan. So we each have 10, we'll go through them one by one and then we'll plug them into this list of 10. So why don't you kick us off Matthew?
Well, I was going to kick us off with a bit of a broad open question, which is you have to have a persona in the mix, but what persona do you have?
Great question, I've thought about this too. I also wonder if the same question should be asked about Yakuza.
That's my second slot is a Yakuza game.
So I personally think Persona 4 is the one that should take the spot because that is a setting you don't get as comprehensively in other video games. There are other video games that have rural Japanese settings, but I would say what is mega distinctive about that game is the way that that setting actually functions in terms of how it feels like sort of like civilized countryside life colliding with capitalism a little bit. And that is quite an interesting, that's very particular.
Whereas I think that Persona 5, the thing about it is it gets its arms around Tokyo extremely well. It represents different areas of that city very well, takes you to a few other places well. But I think Persona 4 edges it just for that reason for being so distinctive in terms of its choice of location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I'd agree with that. I think it ties nicely into some of the systems in Persona, particularly like the social links. They feel quite different in both games because in Tokyo it's like you're anonymous in this incredibly busy place and the social links become about getting footholds in a vast metropolis where in Persona 4 they maybe feel a bit more meaningful because it's about being in a quite quiet lonely place and the connections are more about building out a network and like not going insane by yourself and just having an idea of a small town and getting to know a small town and it's a weird one where it's like, I like just about everything about Persona 5 more than Persona 4, maybe except the setting, which I think is just like pure magic in 4.
Yeah, I completely agree. Well, it sounds like we got our first entry there, Matthew. And so Persona 4 Golden goes in slot number one in that case.
Well done, us.
Yes, we fulfilled our own criteria. The bare minimum has been met. Yes, but I think that makes sense.
Persona 5 is so comprehensive in terms of that. Parts of Japan you've seen before rendered extremely, you know, rendered beautifully, plus parts you've never seen before. It does a lot, but yeah, it's just, it's the real star of Persona 4 Golden, so it has to go in.
Okay. All right, Like A Dragon then, slash Ikusa. What do we pick here?
Because depending on the game you pick, that depends on which one or two or three locations you end up with.
I feel like it has to have Kamurocho at the core.
Yeah, agree.
Because I still think that's the best area they've done. Like I'm not as into Yokohama as much in like the newer games. Like it's not quite as fun.
It's a bit more sort of generic office space to run through.
It's quite a tough location to put in a video game because what is great about Yokohama is it's a little bit spread out.
Yeah.
And it's sort of like it's the bits of it that you can actually explore in the Yakuza games. It's quite limited, you know?
Yeah, in Yakuza it's got like the little restaurant area which feels like Kamurocho over on like the west side. It's got the dock land. It's got like the pier and the park right at the end which is like you have to really like leg it for like several minutes.
And there's lots of big roads you have to cross which is a pain in the arse and you've got like a little shopping district. It's got like everything Kamurocho has but like a lot of crap in between. The one I did think about and maybe not as helpfully because I don't know if you've played it but I did wonder about Judgment, the first detective one they did, just because your relationship with the city, like you're not a criminal, you're a detective in that and your general relationship with the place is like a little bit more sort of kind.
You know, it's again maybe leaning into the persona stuff. You know, it's about making friends with everyone who runs the shops and you make all these allies by doing the side quests and it's very much about like building a little kind of community for Yagami, I think is the detective in that. But I mean as an actual city, it's still Kamurocho, it's very familiar.
I don't know, it's almost like in Judgment, there's like a little bit more interesting stuff going on in the daytime and in Yakuza, it really comes alive at night. It's like which flavor do you want?
So does it only have Kamurocho Judgment?
Yeah.
Oh, so it doesn't have Sotenbori?
No, no, it's quite stripped back.
Do you think we should pick one that's got Sotenbori? Only because that way, I mean, I don't know if we'll have Asaka represented otherwise. I actually really do like your, I'm not saying no to that because I do really like the way you've articulated that and I guess they probably picked Kamurocho precisely because they want you to build that little community within the setting and to view it in that particular way.
So that's part of the intent of the game. I guess I just want to ask a question on Sotenbori Matthew.
As always, we revert to Yakuza Zero just because it's the good one. It's the easiest one to pick up and play. It's the most part of the story.
Yeah, I think you're right. Plus, Sotenbori, you never really... I think I just like the look of it with the bridges and the river.
That's really what I like more than the actual things that you do there. So yeah, let's do it. Let's go with Judgment for number two.
Okay.
And that's it. That's the Yakuza series is out now. So we get to the comedy awards at the end, Matthew.
Yeah. Okay, so our third entry. I mean, I guess now that we've done those points of order, let's go through the rest of your list, Matthew.
Yeah, or are we gonna alternate or are we gonna...
Yeah, yeah, let's alternate, that'd be good.
The world ends with you.
Well, it had to be in there, didn't it? So yeah, I assumed you'd pick it, so I didn't pick it.
For anyone who has not listened to this podcast before, or missed those relevant episodes, the Square Enix contemporary modern day RPG, where you get pulled into a mysterious supernatural game that's playing out in all the fashionable parts of Tokyo and draws on youth culture. It's got, you know, sort of hip hop, sort of soundtrack. It's all about like buying fashionable brands of clothes.
All the characters are in it's probably like the game, which is best suited to Nomura's slightly obnoxious art style. You know, it's like it just all makes sense.
Yeah, a man who I think dreams of perpetually being a cool teenager in Harajuku. I think that's like basically what he what he dreams of being. And so he said he's like, you know, trapped in a 50 something game designer's body.
So that's tough for him. Yeah, I think specifically representing, I like the way that we've kind of gone, right, that Shinjuku ticked off with judgment. We're taking off Shibuya here.
I suppose what I will do actually is, because I think this is a great, a great game and an iconic use of that particular setting and kind of a great time capsule, I guess now, like, because, you know, it's a game that came out in the almost 20 years ago. So it's a little bit of a world's pre-smartphone, you know? So that's kind of significant.
We're not totally pre-smartphone, but pre, like, you know, our particular online age, I guess. And I also think, though, that if we're talking about this particular setting, we should pit it against one of my suggestions, which is Ghostwire Tokyo.
Oh, that was also one of my suggestions.
Well, yeah, I mean, I think that if we only pick one game that's got, or if we pick two, if we pick Shibuya, I think that this game has to be part of the conversation because it captures the crossing and the feeling of walking down those side streets. So magnificently, such a lavish looking game in those sections. And I think that, you know, it was one of the first things I've dialled up after I got back from Tokyo.
I was like, you know what, I fucking really miss being there. So I'm just going to play, I'm just going to walk down this corridor of lights and Modding in loads of roast chicken. Empty storefronts.
Yeah, I downloaded the Shinji Mikami sort of fries chicken DLC. That was the thing that I got. Yeah, so it's, oh God, it renders it so well, right?
What I like about Ghosts Wild Tokyo is it's like quite a shiny, expensive looking 3D version of the city. You know, it's just very detailed on a technical level. Also, because the game is quite sort of acrobatic and you end up like flying around and jumping over rooftops, like you really feel like you can, they've built this area and then you can really explore it properly, which is quite fun.
You know, Yakuza, you only ever see it from, you know, very, very particular angles and a lot of it's locked off from you. And there is something quite fun about just going like mad on the rooftops of this place. But I think more broadly with Ghosts Wild as well, it's like an impossible version of Tokyo.
I think it actually may draw in landmarks from like other cities as well. Like it's more of a sort of vague sort of melange of Japanese landmarks. And because of that, you do get like the, you know, the crossing and it's got like some of the great big kind of cutting-edge shopping centres that they've built in recent years which are really fun to explore, they just look amazing.
But then it also has sort of more suburban districts where there are these like haunted apartment blocks and weird water towers and slightly more off the beaten path. And that was the stuff I think that really resonated with me. It was just like I felt like there were there were bits of, you know, Japanese cities you don't normally see in like the more tourist-friendly games.
Yeah, it's also the most like megabucks looking version of Tokyo, right? Because I think, you know, I think the modern Yakuza games look really good, but there is something about seeing cutting edge, you know, modern visuals with that particular setting. But maybe there's an argument for both because they are such different, like one is almost a vibe thing and the other one is more like what a technical feat is that all this stuff is has been made and built, put in this one location.
Yeah, maybe they both go in. What do you think?
I'd say the argument for like, like World Ends With You is it's more of a culture, it captures more a culture rather than the area one to one while the other one is more about the physical place.
That's a very good argument, I think. Yeah. Well, in which case, Matthew, we've filled four out of ten places already.
So that's, let's go to your next pick.
I think that those last picks have nuked this a little bit in that I had put a shout in for Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. Yes. But more, that's a game that's all about urban legends.
It's sort of an adventure game set across a night where all these strange rituals are happening. But it starts with people investigating these mysteries of Honjo, which are things which have allegedly shaped this particular district or ward of Tokyo. But I do think there is quite a lot of narrative crossover and vibes crossover with Ghostwire.
It's more that I just wanted to shout it out as a slightly different genre that also deals with Tokyo in an interesting way.
Yeah, I like that as a call. I mean, I don't think this is the last time that Tokyo is going to come up more generally anyway. So that's worth keeping in mind.
But how about we have that in the maybe pile and come back to it?
Yeah, I would appreciate that.
All right. Okay. So should we throw one of my picks in there?
Yeah, go for it.
Metropolis Street Racer, Matthew. I was looking up like racing games that use Japan as a setting. And it was interesting to read about this.
Three different cities in Metropolis Street Racer. And they recorded tens of hours of footage of each city on research trips to build them out. And there is, considering it's like the Dreamcast era, there is a phenomenal amount of detail in the maps around the city that they just put in there, really.
To the point where some fans have actually been pausing it and pulling out specific textures that have Easter eggs or specific details or references to other bizarre creations games from the time as a Fur Fighters reference in one of the textures, for example, the Speedpass or Dreamcast references and things like that. And I think as a kind of like feat of the era and as a kind of like representative of the racing genre where we got Forza Horizon 6 coming next year, which is set in Japan, that's obviously very exciting. But like, I feel like Metropolis Street Racer was the kind of coolest use of this setting from the little deep dive I did.
But what do you think?
Not a game I've played, but I do like the idea of seeing a city from, you know, seeing a country from a different perspective, albeit, you know, zooming past it incredibly fast.
You did play this game though, Matthew. You played it with me last year very briefly when I was around your house.
Oh, that fucking thing. Oh, yeah.
It's a joint cast games here.
Yeah, I guess they don't all have to be great games set in Japan.
Well, it was all right. It was just really hard to see with the original resolution of that fucking console, because everything coming towards you was grainy as shit.
Yeah.
So that possibly counts against it. I think it's another one for the maybe part.
Yeah, I do like that. With every generation comes the first very shiny racing game, which they inevitably go to some of the same places that they've always gone to. And that's how you can be like, you know, how well a game does.
Piccadilly Circus gives you an idea of like how good graphics are going to be that generation. So I do like a nod to that fine tradition in this list somewhere.
I think that people really rated how bizarre did this stuff, though, that they were like they were like a step forward of where everyone else was at in terms of putting thought and effort into catching these locations. So yeah, that's that's kind of what I wanted to put in here. It's a very celebrated game.
But yeah, I thought it was pretty impressive given the time frame it came from. What's your next game, Matthew?
I can't place it in any specific place geographically, because I don't know if the story ever specifically spells out. But my lone sort of feudal era pic is Shadow Tactics, Blade of the Shogun.
Ah, interesting. We should pit this against Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.
I think I opted for this because, you know, I was saying earlier I was wrestling a little bit with games which sort of mixed in history and fantasy to the point where I was like, does this really classify anymore? And Shadow Tactics, just by dint of being humans versus humans, there is no supernatural element to it. It feels like it is trying in some way or another to capture a moment in Japan.
I also think the actual style of the game, which is a real time tactics game which you sort of view from an isometric view, the genre you are probably familiar with in like Commandos or Desperados, it's like a very shiny update of that genre with a fully 3D camera, so it's all beautifully modelled. But there is something about this particular historic setting and the buildings and how kind of ornate a lot of that Japanese architecture is that just really sits nicely in these little 3D dioramas that you can kind of spin. Like these level designs, like they're almost the sort of video game equivalent of like bonsai trees, you know, they're these perfectly kind of sort of prim and sort of pampered things to, you know, they're absolutely pristine and it captures the spirit of something in that but at the same time I don't think it is like any particular like period of history.
It's a bit vague.
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I did see this as a choice and thought you'll probably pick it so I wouldn't need to. I guess like as well I don't, you know, it is challenging to be like, I don't want to just say there's only one period piece is valid because these are loads of different eras of history but for the purpose of a top 10 list it will end up being a little bit like that so totally owning up to that.
Because Sekiro has been such an influential game, that's why I thought it just had to be in the mix here because again I think this is really taking a spot as well that Onimusha might have taken to which is again that blending of like demonic shit and sort of like a specific period of Japanese history so you know there's a little bit of that going on again. It's not the same period of history, it's not one to one by any means.
And I think if you've stripped out all the demons from Sekiro, it definitely ticks that box of like massive Japanese fortresses for you to climb and little villages and towns to infiltrate. You maybe don't get a moment to appreciate that in the game just because you're constantly struggling not to get killed by like the weakest enemy in the map at every single moment. And so maybe the detail and the vision of the setting kind of gets lost in the general anxiety of playing it for me, but I was just thinking back to the bits of it I did play, I'm like, oh, actually it's a pretty good chunk of landscape you get to explore in Sekiro.
I wouldn't say no to that.
So set in the late 1500s basically, or perhaps early 1600s is speculated.
I don't think we should have any entries in this list from the same centuries. I'm really going to have to enforce that. So let's get all these on the timeline and just see how it works out.
I'm working way too hard here. The fact is I think that Sekiro's dialogue only ever really hints at a wider historical context. Like you say, it's more about, isn't it cool to climb this big castle and fight these guys who are chucking knives at you?
No one's out here saying these events actually happened. There was never a little lad with a fake arm who jumped off of a cliff and stabbed a big white snake in the head. You know, that never happened.
So it's fine. OK, I think let's put Sekiro in at number five and then Shadow Tactics in reserve then. Purely because I think that expectations wise, Sekiro is almost on that Persona and Yakuza level of like you would expect to see it in this kind of list, you know?
OK, maybe that's unfair. What's your next pick, Matthew?
For a very different slice of Japanese living, Promise Mascot Agency.
Ah, this is one of my picks as well.
Oh, excellent. It is a fictional town, right? Casso Macchi.
Yeah, there's no like big thumb that's running this town right now. That's not a thing that's happening.
Yeah, no, but ignoring the thumb, like I'm pretty sure this is like a fictional region, but it is quite fun in that, well, it's very fun, this is a great game, but it isn't just another huge urban center. It is a town and the surrounding regions and a slightly rundown place. Part of the pleasure of this is getting to intimately know the town, the coastline, the farmland, everything around it, and then seeing it all come back to life as you gradually tidy it up.
So, it's like not only an interesting different place that you would usually see, but your relationship with it is like super tight.
Yeah, for sure. And also just has so many different characters who help to give that location a very particular flavor to the point where, you know, they even have characters who are like, they have like characters from outside Japan who are in that town and like describe their experience of living there. You know, so much effort went into the writing from the really wacky characters you meet to the ones you feel a little bit more grounded.
It does that video game thing of like merging the real world with a bit of fantastical strangeness, you know, it definitely has that kind of like that sort of dimension to it. So yeah, I think this is a dead set, like just as a game with a really considered Japanese setting, but one you haven't necessarily seen before, certainly not in this particular unusual open world game format they've done. I think that it's going in there, Matthew, for slot number six.
Nice.
But Pinky shouldn't be mayor. I stand by that.
You stand by that.
That town's finished within a year after that, much as I enjoy the company of Pinky. Anyway, now we move on, Matthew, to my next pick, which is bound to be on your list, Attack of the Friday Monsters.
Yes, that was my next on my list.
Yep, so a 3DS download classic, and a game that is again very kind of slice of life in its sort of like perspective. It's really part of a lineage of games that are a bit like this from the same creator whose name I have not noted here, Matthew. But if you want basically this kind of again Japanese countryside sort of saying the kind of thing that numerous studio Ghibli films sort of like present idealized versions of or you know, or capture in some way.
It's really, it's got a really particularly appealing art style. And you know, as the name suggests, also has like big monsters as part of the plot at the same time. Been quite a few years since I've played this, but it's a beloved game for a reason, Matthew.
Do you think it should be in the list?
Chappie Made It has made a lot of other slice of life games like this. There's the Japanese series, which escapes my mind, but famously Tim Rogers did that massive video essay on it. I think he's also responsible for the Crayon Shin-Chan, Let's Go on Holiday to the Countryside games now.
And they're all about routines and everyday life out in the countryside, and like the feeling of being on a summer holiday in a small town, and like hearing nature and being a little bit bored, maybe.
I got you. He's Kazuhiro Kazayabe.
That's the one.
And the series is Amboku no Natsuyasumi.
There we go.
And I think they were entries on PS2. And then, yeah, the Shin-Chan ones are more of a recent thing. 2021 was the first one.
Yeah.
But yeah, I absolutely agree. It's just nice to see a different pace of life. It's why I quite like the...
Oh, what's his name? Anime filmmaker who did your name. And he's not the Summer Wars, not Hossada.
It's Shinkai, maybe?
Yeah, Makoto Shinkai.
Makoto Shinkai, yeah. Who does, you know, it's like anime, but also set in like a very recognisable everyday life. And so takes, you know, great pains to like draw what a car radio looks like, or here's an old VCR player, you know, branded VCR player, but I've drawn that into the world.
And he just, it's like a real mundane beauty, I guess. That's super appealing. That's way more appealing to me than, um, fucking Demon Slayer Mugen Train.
Plus big 3DS is very, very us. So rather than trying to pick one of his other games, this does make sense. I think the Shin-Chan game did come out here as well.
I own it on Switch.
How is it? You played it?
Yeah, I did. I liked it. I liked, I mean, the stuff in that game, which is of a piece with his other games, like the town setting and the slice of life and all that, that's great.
I don't particularly like Crayon Shin-Chan as this like me neither. Weird little obnoxious dude who's like getting his ass out constantly.
Well, that's what I mean. Aren't those things at odds a little bit? Like, do they, do they totally line up?
It's like taking this incredibly like bucolic countryside sim and then putting Eric Cartman in it. It's just very stressful and wrong.
Yeah, it's like, I was going to say, it's not like sending those blokes from bottom to the Lake District or something. It's sort of like the contrast there doesn't quite make sense. So, yeah, I did always wonder that about that game.
I thought, why fucking Shinchang? That's just so, so strange. Yeah, okay.
Attack of the Friday Monsters, though, like a very, a very lovely game. You can no longer buy it, though, so that's tough.
Yes, well, of course.
Yes, but again, if you'd have listened to that 3DS episode that we did a few years ago, Matthew did warn you and gave you some notice.
So that's on you.
Yes. Well, hopefully, you just own it, or you can just go observe screenshots of it on the internet. So what's your next pick, Matthew?
This is where we get into the realms of, you know, I'm probably repeating myself and it's just my, you know, my personal tastes are so specific that there's going to be some similar things in here. And I think this maybe occupies the same territory as Attack of the Friday Monsters, but Famicom Detective Club, NEO The Smiling Man. So that's the most recent one.
AKA game that's a six out of 10 until the ending.
Until the ending, fucks you up for life. And you're like, what on earth was Nintendo doing with this? This is crazy.
Yeah. It's like when Nintendo accidentally hired David Fincher to do the end of the game.
That was wild. When you told me about that, I was like, oh my God, this is so much more interesting than the actual game itself.
But what I do like about it, again, like those Shinkai films, it's set in super mundane places. It's not like the tourist attractions of Tokyo. I don't think the city's even named, but you know, you go to schools and libraries and, you know, slightly drab cafes and restaurants and homes.
And there's just, there's some pleasure to be taken in just seeing like domestic everyday environments. I think that's the bit of the game which resonated with me the most. It's just, oh, it isn't, you know, the Shibuya Crossing again.
You know, it's something a bit more down to earth and I don't know, that grounds the whole thing, makes the mystery a little bit more relatable. But I, it maybe steps on the toes of like what I think Attack of the Friday Monsters maybe does in a slightly better game. So I can, you know, I won't be upset if it doesn't make the cut.
Well, it can go in the maybe pile and it's a reminder that that did happen that game.
Yeah, it happened.
That is something. It sure did. Yeah.
Okay. In some ways, I did also wonder if maybe like it made sense to have one visual novel in the mix here just to sort of, but I guess Attack of the Friday Monsters kind of ticks that box a little bit.
Yeah. Well, I've still got my last pick. So we'll see when we get to that.
Very true. I guess Matthew, we have to litigate. Does Hokkaido from Hitman World of Assassination go in here?
Again, very obviously us. But what do you think?
It's an all-timer Japanese location in the game.
Yeah. Not in any other game either.
I was definitely going to give it an award in our awards section because it is one of my favorite locations, which is maybe why I didn't include it in my list of 10.
I think you're right. I think that's the place for it because it's just one level, right? It's not like it's the whole game and there are whole games that are set in Japan.
But it is like a setting that you don't see represented elsewhere, right? It's that very particular region of Japan. There's like real specificity has gone into the thinking behind that choice, you know?
I think it's impossible. I'm always looking up online to see if there are any hotels actually like this, like an amazing glass hotel basically balanced on top of a mountain. I don't think they exist.
At least they don't exist in a space where someone like me could buy a ticket to it. I think it's private. It's something that's so expensive.
It's not even on the Internet. There's just no point.
I could also see it being the kind of location that pops up in one of your Japanese grime novels, Matthew, where it's like the case of the glass house.
Oh, yeah.
A big plate of glass falls on a man or something, and then there's some preposterous explanation of how and why that happened. That it's explained at the very end with diagrams, and then you're like, oh yeah, I see how that happened.
And you're like, oh, I didn't know I needed to have maths to understand this story. Right.
Yeah, I thought it was just the work of fiction, but here we are. Yeah, okay. I think just having...
I would be so tempted just because it's so particular. Obviously, I cannot speak to its authenticity. As Matthew explained, we literally cannot go there because we don't have enough money.
But it's definitely not something you see elsewhere in different video games. So it doesn't go on the maybe pile, but I did want to at least mention it. Do you think Shenmue should go in here, Matthew, the original?
I think people would probably expect to see it on there.
And it is again a particular location. It's combined with the very detailed way in which everyday life is represented, means it earns its place based on that. But yes, I don't know.
You get to open all those drawers.
It's just so particular to be like, okay, it's 1986 in Yokosuka, and like, you know, your father's been murdered, and you've got to just very slowly, and so slowly in fact that within three games, it's still not been resolved as a thing, and will probably never be resolved now. The game successfully, I think by making you live in it almost in a sim-like fashion, makes you appreciate the level of detail in such a granular way because you're confronted with it all the time. Yeah, but my impression of Shenmue is still coloured so much by having like mostly played the second one and only played it with the English voices on, which is some of the worst voices of all time.
So me taking Shenmue seriously as a piece of culture is still a challenge, to be honest. And Matthew has this whole Dreamcast thing going on as well. So it's not easy for us.
But I think it belongs in there. Like, if you play that, you know, you exist in that one place for such a long time. And that's kind of a feat of game design in itself.
So it gets our eighth slot then, Matthew.
Yeah, I think that's okay. I think I can live with that. I'm not too upset by that.
Has literally correct weather to the day that it's set, hasn't it? Didn't he go back and do all the weather forecasts?
That'd be much easier to do in the UK. You just pick gloomy skies for like about eight months of the year. And that will pretty much cover your back.
Yeah. And everyone's like, you're a genius.
Yeah. Okay, then. All right.
So you've got one more pick, right?
Yeah. My last suggestion, and this may not make the cut just because it is already covered in so many other games. But I will make a case for my beloved 428 Shibuya Scramble, which obviously has the Shibuya crossing in it.
Why I think this is like for me, maybe the ultimate Japanese game is it's a visual novel. And instead of being drawn and illustrated as visual novels often are, it's all done with photography of real life actors in real life locations. If you ever read about the making of this game, you find out they had a hell of a time actually making it and trying to take photos in famous landmarks where they probably shouldn't have been taking photos.
But what I like about it is it's set in the heart of Tokyo, over the course of a day. It goes from the Shibuya crossing into the arcades and restaurants and small businesses and back streets and suburban areas. And it's all just photographs of the real place.
As a bit of a weeb and looking for that escapism, I love seeing the real place in this game. It's kind of like playing a thriller in Google Maps Street View. Because it's tangibly the place.
And it isn't just an interpretation of it, it is it. And I would often, as I was playing the game, I was always stopping it and then trying to find the real life location on Street View by looking up like business names and signs and things, just to see how it looked like 20 years on. As a little snapshot of it.
I mean, it is niche and it is covering old territory. And, you know, I'm basically making the case for just a photo album of Tokyo from 20 years ago, with loads of good thriller writing around the outsides. But I think there's something quite different about that.
Yeah, there is. When we did the episode about the UK, we kind of picked the getaway for similar reasons.
This is way better than the getaway.
I mean, is that the most brutal comparison I've ever made?
No, but I know you play getaway because you want to see a Virgin Megastore, right?
Yeah, you just want to see a scanned in texture, low res of like HMV from 2000, just copied and pasted into the game.
If you want to see an old-ass KFC in Japan, you'll definitely see that in this game.
Yeah, I like that. But I think that it's good to have one game that doesn't even vaguely impressionistic about how it renders the place, it just is the place. Because if we were doing like LA for this, for example, we would definitely pick LA Noire for that same reason.
Yeah. It's like the place is the thing, like in a precise one-to-one way. So yeah, I think it goes in based on that, Matthew.
It's a good argument. I know that you always like to recommend that game to people.
Yeah. One day, someone who listens to the podcast, one person will play this game.
I'm sure they already have based on that.
I don't know. It hasn't cut through like Hotel Dusk, because Hotel Dusk sounds so much sexier of like a mysterious hotel, and it's a bit like Twin Peaks where I think people struggle to visualize this thriller set to static images of like actors in Tokyo.
But you're missing the other key ingredient of Hotel Dusk, is that buying a DS game is lovely. I mean, it just is. Oh, getting the box, opening it, snapping out of that little thing, putting it in.
Oh, the ritual aspect of it. It's way more exciting than a digital download will ever be. So that is the factor that is helping Hotel Dusk, being on DS, I think.
But yes, I'm sure real ones know with four tweets should be a scramble, Matthew. Okay, so we have one more slot to pick, and we have four, I guess, honorable mentions. I will also run through the three others that I had here, Matthew.
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
So there are two pretty iconic Japan set stages in Street Fighter II. There's a Suzaku Castle, which is literally a castle setting, and Capcom U, which I believe is like a bath house. And so I did want to kind of like note those, because even though this game is set around the world, I do wonder how much of the imagery in it was the first time people were exposed to Japanese culture in some way.
Because I don't think anyone's ever really thinking that the Vegas stage in Street Fighter II is like, oh, they went there and did meticulous research. You feel like you're experiencing the entire world through the prism of these incredibly talented Japanese artists. And these levels have persisted through different Street Fighter games.
So I guess I at least wanted to have the conversation, because in both Tekken and Street Fighter, Japan set levels are a key feature.
And I like the idea of, let's take an aspect or a particular landmark or just a thing and make it a bit overblown. And whenever I think of Street Fighter, I think of it as, is it like Scotland is just like giant boughs of whiskey in Street Fighter IV? Isn't that right?
I think so, yeah.
Yeah, that's fun. Yeah, I mean, this stuff's beautiful. And I think I mentioned on the recent Excel episode, I used to do a column, a regular spread about how 8-bit and 16-bit games, like, you know, depicted the world and fighting games were always great for this.
You probably won't get more detailed artistry on like one screen than you will in a fighting game from this era. You know, there's some of the most like beautiful games because of that. And, yeah, seeing them try and capture a whole place in one screen.
It's a pretty good case for it.
Yeah, on role mentions, it maybe goes in for that purpose for the time being. But, yeah, I think it's just, you know, it just has like endured as well. It's repeated in both things are repeated in every single, I think every single game in the series, more or less, and most recently in Street Fighter V for both of them.
So, you know, they've definitely kind of persisted. But, yeah, and the other two I wanted to talk about. So, Tokyo Jungle, I've thrown in here, as a kind of like iconic cult weird game set in Tokyo.
It is a game where animals fight other animals. It's quite cursed. It is a PS3 download only game.
I have talked about this a little bit before. It's definitely got the whiff of an honorable mention here, I suppose, to something I would push for. But I don't know, when you looked up, like when you did a bit of research on this, you must have noted that this game was in pretty much every fucking list of games set in Japan.
Yeah, yeah. I've reviewed this, I think, for Games Master.
It's not good, is it? But it is interesting.
Feels like it should be like a cult classic, but it is ass.
Yeah. And the only other one I was going to throw in here was, I wondered whether Pokémon Red and Blue were worth talking about, because I think each region in the first four generations of Pokémon games are named after, you know, real areas of Japan and are based on real areas of Japan. Now, there's definitely an impressionistic vibe to it in the sense that, yes, they've added all these monsters that don't actually exist in these places, but also they've done things like, you know, built up cities in the game are surrounded by countryside and everywhere is quite sort of like verdant in Pokémon.
So it's not really an accurate depiction of anything in particular, but I do think that the flavor of it is very specifically Japanese in the sense that even like the NPCs you encounter, when you encounter like a school girl or school boy, they look like kids from Japan. You know, like I think when you understand what the, where the game comes from, the particular stylistic touches in the game make more sense. So I wanted to at least mention that as a thing as well.
I've never really thought of them like that, but you know, I accept that that is true and there probably are those connections. You know, I've always just found the localization of those games puts them in a bit of a nowhere land. Like no one really sounds like they're from anywhere in those games to me.
You know, they're just quite kind of, just sort of nondescript and friendly.
I think this even comes down to things like the different islands that are off the coast are based on real, you know, real places and stuff. Like it's, I'm not pushing for it as like a must, a must have inclusion, but I did think of them as games that, you know, have a particular Japanese creative outlook on them. And I don't think that, I don't think anyone ever play this and think, oh, I think this game is based on Britain or America or whatever.
Again, straight into the honorable mentions pile, Matthew. And we do have nine games so far. So we have one final slot.
And in honorable mentions, we have Paranormous Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, Metropolis Street Racer, Shadow Tactics, Blades of the Shogun, Famicom Detective Club, Street Fighter II. And yeah, that's it, actually. Those are the ones I think we decided are in contention.
I quite like either Street Fighter or Metropolis Street Racing. Just from a genre perspective, it's like quite a different way of approaching these locations, and I think that's quite fun. It nods to the fact that sports games do actually do quite a bit of heavy lifting in terms of taking you around the world.
Yeah, a lot of competitive games do. Like, the new Battlefield has, I believe, maybe one or two maps set in Japan. And I think the Call of Duty that came out last year, or the year before, had two or three maps set in Japan as well.
Can't wait to level Tokyo Tower.
Yeah, okay, so I agree with that. So what should we say? Should we say MSR or Street Fighter 2?
You decide, pal. I don't mind.
Let's say Street Fighter, just because it's so rare that a fighting game gets a look in on this podcast.
It's just so visually distinct from everything else that's in the list as well. So I think it's a good little list, even if not seeing the word Yakuza on it is making me freak out a tiny bit. But here's what we got for our canon of a game, Hall of Fame Matthew.
So we've got Persona 4 Golden, Judgment, The World Ends With You, Ghostwire Tokyo, Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Promise Mascot Agency, Attack of the Friday Monsters, Shenmue, 4-8 Shibuya Scramble and Street Fighter 2. Feel strong.
That's a banner of a list.
I think we're done. I think we did it.
You'd have a great time playing that list.
I think you would. Bare minimum accomplished, I would say. And in the honorable mentions pile, we've got Paranormal Sight, Shadow Tactics, Famicom Detective Club, Emeo's Smiling Club, or whatever it was called.
Emeo's Smiling Club. What an absolute shrug from you.
No, I'm sorry. I just got it wrong.
Oh, whatever the fucking school. Emeo's the fucking bullshit.
Emeo's Smiling Club. What the fuck is that? What did I mean by Emeo's Smiling Club?
Emeo runs a comedy club called Emeo's Smiling Club.
No, that's the Will Arnett film.
Oh, I'm seeing that tomorrow, actually. And I think we have to be there 30 minutes early, which makes me wonder, is Will Arnett actually gonna be there? I'll be livid if he's still got us Jason Bateman here.
It's meant to be very good.
Yeah, I know, but I just can't quite buy that, you know? It's sort of like, I mean, I'm going to see it on purpose. I paid a lot of money to see it, but nonetheless, I'm looking forward to it, Matthew.
Okay, shall we take a very short break, then fire through these bonus categories, Matthew?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, we've done the actual main hall of fame here, and much like last time, we have a vague whiff of some comedy nonsense at the end to kind of see us out. So, Matthew, award number one, best restaurant or bar in a game, go.
Please hold on to your sides. It's Cafe LeBlanc from Persona 5.
That's mine as well. Of absolute cataclysmic failure of imagination. Do you know the problem I had here?
Is I think that this is actually something that the Yakuza games don't do super well. You got like broad strokes of locations, but I never really in a bar or restaurant in that game, they're thinking this place rules. It's so iconic.
They put so much effort into the detail of X. It's not quite that kind of game, but Persona specializes in this because everything is like this one scene, this one static screen that gives you everything you need to know.
Yeah, and the fact that it does coffee and curry, that's quite cool, and it's your little base of operation, so you have a real fondness and emotional connection to it. I like the old geezer who runs it.
Yeah, he's great. I agree, that's the right pick for this. There are some other good locations in Persona 5 for this.
When they beat that one boss, then go to that buffet in a tower somewhere. That was pretty cool, but yes, Café LeBlanc wins. Favorite Japanese location in a game, Matthew?
Well, this is the one I was going to pick Hokkaido for. Just because it is amazingly sleek and aspirational, it may not actually be based on anything. We don't know.
We're too poor to find out, as already established. Like, if you can Google it, it's too scuzzy for the super rich. I love the sleekness of it.
I love how clean it is, all the glass. I love the fact that all your security passes are, like, woven into your sort of kimonos as you walk around the place. If it doesn't exist, someone should absolutely do that, because it's just such a cool idea.
Maybe less so, like, when you get into the back half, and it's, like, a weird hospital, and there's a man having open-heart surgery. Like, I don't particularly want to see that happen. But the front bit, the hotel bit, I really like that.
Yeah, that's cool. I like that. That's nice and specific.
Like, I really went with the boring pick of Sega World from the Yakuza games for this. I think just because my first trip ever to Japan, I went to Sega World in Shinjuku, and obviously, it's gone now, or I think it's been turned into some other bullshit. Something like that happened.
But very recognizable building with that big red front and stuff. And obviously, the effort made to put the arcade games in the game really helps. But yes, I mean, to be honest, though, it's the more general thing of just existing in a nice version of Shibuya or whatever.
Like, the scene that crossing in Ghostwire Tokyo is an amazing special effect, for sure.
But even though there's a giant scary ghost parade that comes through every 10 minutes.
That's not ideal, but the lights are nice. Electricity builds off the chain, but the vibes are immaculate. Japanese location from a game you'd least like to live in, Matthew?
It has to be the sanatorium turned hotel from Fatal Frame Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. I mean, that is just a building designed to look as scary as it can. And it's full of ghosts.
If you could get rid of the ghosts, I think it would still be quite scary, because one of the mechanics in that game is you have to hold a button to put your hand into dark holes or slowly move back curtains. And it's just rife with terrifying drapes. So I just don't think I could deal with that.
I've basically got where the giant ape lives in Sekiro Shad I Starve Twice, the one who chucks poo at you. If I had to move in to the little cave where he lives in that sunken valley place, that's tough. I just get there with my one suitcase.
I've just got there and I'm like, yeah. So this ape that's been infested by a parasite and who yearns for a partner who will never come, you have to live with this ape now? That's bad times for your boy.
So that's what I went with for that one, Matthew.
Yeah. I guess also if we did exist in the Yakuza universe, there's no way we're a protagonist. We're one of those side missions where a guy's getting beaten up by three hoodlums and you just hope that by the time the player encounters us, they're not bored of doing that and just walk past it.
Yeah.
You're like, someone's always holding their fist inches from your face ready to punch you. That's our role in that world.
I completely agree. Okay. Next up then.
Location you'd most like to see turned into a real life themed cafe, like the Dragon Quest or Kirby ones. What have you got for this?
This is one I added and then didn't have any good answers for.
It's quite hard actually this one.
In Silent Hill F, they keep talking about this sweet shop but you never really get to go in it or see it. So the idea of the sweet shop from Silent Hill F, it's just a nice sweet shop. I don't want it to be full of fucking manifestations of whatever evil shit I've done in my life.
Like a guilt-free sweet shop based on the Silent Hill F sweet shop. That's what I want.
Okay. Would any of the monsters from Silent Hill be in the cafe with you or?
I don't know. Maybe the waitresses could dress up as the sort of slightly booby doll park contraptions.
Perfect. I see no issues with that as a relaxing cafe experience. I've cheated a little bit here and I've gone with the Honey Bee Inn from Final Fantasy VII, Matthew.
Oh, that's all right.
Well, I mean, specifically the remake version, which I think is a little bit less like, you know, lewd or whatever. It's more like there's just, you know.
They bottle it a little bit in the remake.
They do. Yeah. They make it like less horny basically.
And so that's tough. But you know, they do have that.
So which version are you having?
I think we're going to have to, okay, we're going to do two versions, right? If you go to like the 50th floor, you can have the horny, cursed PS1 version. But if you're like next door to the Kirby Cafe, the Sky Tree in Tokyo, you can go to this very sanitized version instead.
So that's, and the staff are dressed as bees, isn't that nice? And there's a musical number once every like 45 minutes or something. So yeah.
I think they should have the option for punters to, like if you've got a private room, people can look through the keyhole at you eating your snacks.
That's a great touch. No notes there. Okay.
Next award Matthew. The Demon-Encrusted Pagodas Award for Most Fanciful Japanese Period Setting. What have you got?
I thought it probably has to be Sekiro, but I did put down Kinnitsugami Path of the Goddess, which has, I mean, it's a game where you're literally kind of cleaning the demon crust from those Torii gates and things like that. It's like an especially crusty game that. It's about cleansing crusts, so I thought that would qualify.
Well, likewise, I've put Akami here, because that's a game about, you know, you're clearing out kind of demonic stuff from this period Japanese setting and then bringing nature back basically and then wiping out all of the horrid stuff that's been done to the landscape. So, you know, as that kind of like, you know, fanciful version of a Japanese Period Setting, I think either one basically qualifies for that one. So, yes, that's my pick anyway.
Okay, bit of an interesting one here. This is Mike Agri and I did pick it for a particular reason, but best hybrid Japanese setting or places to have big Japanese energy, thinking if you're San Fransokyo type settings. What have you got for this one Matthew?
I've got a few different things because I couldn't really pick between them. One of them was the World Marshall building from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, which is the very drab Denver skyscraper and then you climb up to the top and then suddenly it becomes like a secret sort of Japanese garden with like bridges and pagodas and you have a, you know, basically it feels like you're in a very sort of, you know, killbillish kind of Tokyo fight at the top of this quite nondescript office building. I always thought that was quite a nice little touch.
Yeah, that's really a really cool pic actually. You've thought about this in a slightly more interesting way than I have. But I think that-
Well I don't know, you haven't heard my other pics so.
Well I think that like, I actually thought that the PS1 Resident Evils would suit this quite well. Like there's something not quite, like sort of like very much Japan, Japanese prism on an American setting about-
Yeah, oh okay, yeah I get that.
That's kind of good. But actually the real reason I put this is because I was listening to the My Perfect Console episode with Alexander O. Smith, the translator, and he mentioned Phoenix Wright as being like a version of this by necessity because there are particular references in it that are very Japanese, but the game at the same time has, you know, it's obviously in English, but it was from an era before these games were like always like taking the most authentic tack.
So it does end up being this really interesting hybrid where sometimes it feels kind of American, sometimes it feels very obviously Japanese. Like Larry Butts could definitely be an American character, for example, but some of those other characters are like, they feel culturally fixed to, you know, a Japanese game and a Japanese setting.
The industry around Gourd Lake is very Japanese.
Yeah, very much. So the fucking Samurai TV show is very Japanese. You know, it's so, but I really like that because I hadn't really thought of that as being the approach they took to Phoenix Wright until I listened to that episode, which was very good, by the way.
And yeah, I thought that was good. And what are your other suggestions?
Well, I was thinking Cyberpunk obviously has some amazing like Japanese-inflected sort of compounds and skyscrapers. Konpeki Plaza, the hotel at the start where you find Kojima hanging out. I mean, that place is so fucking rad.
The problem with Cyberpunk is it presents the sort of Japanese faction, I can't remember the family's name, as like the Arasaka family, as being like the worst of the worst. But that's easily the coolest bit of their city. Like I would, I just want to be a corpo in that world.
Like I would be quite happy to be part of that whole organization and whatever they're up to, just because they get the coolest locations.
Triple down for Cyberpunk 2, I say. Like triple down on the Arasaka family.
Yeah, I just don't want to be like bringing it all down. I want to like be part of that world. That's so cool.
Of course, beloved Shinra HQ, that feels very sort of Japanese skyscraper. An amazing workplace. I've long envied all the people who get to work at Shinra.
You wish the future building was like that and you go onto the 47th floor to work on O&M.
Oh yeah. Shinra HQ is like, they're cleaning up, they're taking home the best workplace award from gamesindustry.com every year.
Yeah. Whereas, yeah, I don't know, like, hey, you know, Key House, they had that cafeteria where they serve chips every day. That was all right, wasn't it?
But hey ho. OK, next one. I actually didn't fucking write an answer for this one.
Oh, I wrote this down and I didn't again. I struggled, but I'll see what I can do.
Game that most accurately captures your experience of Japan. I mean, I guess I'll have to go for Majima in a bin. You know, that's sort of like really as close as it gets.
Or sort of like getting robbed by Mr. Shakedown is not true either, because I struggled to spend the money I even brought there, because everything is so reasonably priced because of the pound versus yen difference at the moment. But Majima in a bin really, Matthew, that was your category.
That's got a lot more specificity, because I definitely associate with whenever they have a goofy western character in a Yakuza game, they're always like the biggest clown you meet, like a total idiot who's like stumbled into some terrible situation. You know, it's always a side quest. They've always the dumbest side quests.
It's like in the character models, it's like one of three Caucasian NPCs that they have. I definitely feel that. I've been seeing a lot of people talk about the game The Exit 8, that one where you're just constantly lost in like a sort of liminal underground station.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep seeing that on like TikTok and stuff.
I'm like not very good at navigating places at the best of time. You know, I get terribly lost in like, you know, very simple things like shopping centers and hotels and underground stations. So you know, I actually haven't played it, but I imagine that that's quite true to my tourist experience.
Yeah. Okay. Well, I think that's a good suggestion.
I've got to play that game at some point because it's like five quid or something. It's like no money and I kind of want to give it a go. So, okay, this is a great award, Matthew.
Maybe you should read this one out actually.
This is the Black Rain Award for Best Version of Japan made by Western Studio.
Great stuff. I mean, I guess the obvious answer would be something like Ghost of Yote, but I think I'm going to give this to Metropolis Street Racer for the reasons I mentioned earlier and because it didn't get one of the main awards. But I do think that they really did their homework and it feels like they've gone for authenticity rather than just building a caricature.
I want to reward the old bizarre creations team for that, Matthew. What have you got?
A little shout out again for Shadow Tactics, just for where are me, me, me from? They're a Nordic company. I can't remember.
I apologize. Are they German? Anyway, that's terrible.
I can't remember that. In Imperfect Game, and I'm not saying I like it more than Yotai or Tsushima, but I do think the Japan in Assassin's Creed Shadows is pretty amazing. The landscape and the historical cities and things, the Yotai Tsushima ones, they're a little bit more impressionistic.
They're not trying to be like a recreation of a specific time and place, I don't think. That is the thing I like most about Assassin's Creed Shadows. So I'll give that a little shout out and annoy everyone who prefers Yotai.
Well, I don't know, I don't think people have massively strong opinions on that either way so far. Not in our Discord anymore.
No, probably not. It's like the least spicy bit of contrarian bullshit imaginable.
Okay, well that's fair enough. Best Japanese character Matthew, who have you got?
Oh, I mean, there's so many. I love all the old geezers in Like a Dragon slash Infinite Wealth, like all the sort of middle-aged guys that make up your party. I really like the villain in Infinite Wealth, Yatake Yamai, who's like this gangster who's been banished to Hawaii.
And I don't know if he's like specifically been cursed, but he can never ever get warm, even though he's in this tropical paradise. And he's always wearing this thick coat, and he's always like shaking because he's got a permanent cold. This strange guy, and you fight him like four or five times across the game, you keep running into him and having increasingly bizarre boss fights with him.
But he's a real character. I think one of their most successful villains in a series with loads of great villains, I think he's a real standout. I always have to shout out from 428 Shibuya Scramble, the freelance journalist Minoru Minori Kawa, who writes for this terrible gossip rag called Four Star General Gossip, and has till 8 p.m. to fill an entire magazine of copy before his best mate's company goes out of business.
And it's just him running around Tokyo, trying to make a story out of anything he sees. He's just great. The guy's got a really great face.
Everything he does is really funny. Good to see a freelance journalist get the protagonist role. Yeah, those are my picks.
Yeah, good suggestions. I've got Majima Pre-Bin from Yakuza Zero. Big fan of him.
That's my sole suggestion actually. I just really like that character.
Pre-Bin.
Just a man stuck in a particular situation under duress and there seems to be no way out for him. And then he does find a way out and gets in a bin and follows you around in Yakuza Kiwami. But Pre-Bin, very good.
Yakuza would be my favorite of the old man faces from Yakuza Zero, come up many times. Yeah, I guess there's a bunch more I could have had there, but I thought I'd keep that fairly straightforward. Worst Japanese character Matthew.
So I've got two characters tying here from the Onimusha series. I've got Gogunduntus from Onimusha 2. He's kind of a demon, so it doesn't really count, but he sort of monologues about himself whenever he arrives.
He goes, my name is Gogunduntus. I am the, he's like the arbiter of all demons or something like that. But then there's like another, another lad who's like a secondary antagonist throughout the Onimusha series until Dawn of Dreams when he goes from being like this quite skinny guy to this quite tubby guy who's suddenly very demonic.
It's this guy, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, because he's like just this really scrawny kind of like, ah ha ha, laughs in your face sort of like antagonist. You never really fight in the game.
Or is he like the mad scientist guy from the first game?
I think, I don't know if he's a scientist, but you'd recognize him. He sort of like, he always laughs a lot. And then Samunosuke is like, hey, come back, in that very PS2 voice acting.
He's got terrible voice acting.
Terrible voice acting.
Yeah, he's like ha ha ha ha ha. That kind of laughter.
Yes, exactly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, you know, I wanted to put him in there, because, you know, I would say most of the PS2 Onimusha characters are tough hangs, particularly in that first game. But this guy is like king tough hang from those games. So, he goes in there.
I don't want to put Jin Sakai in there. He's just a bit boring, but he's not like a bad character or anything. He's just dull.
What have you got, Matthew?
That little pervy bug sidekick from the colony, Issun.
Oh, great shout. What a, yeah.
Just talks too much. Irritating.
So bad that they had to add a setting to the game to skip dialogue in like the further versions, because no one could fucking bear listening to him anymore. So that alone means he deserves this award, I think, Matthew.
Yeah. The other one I have, and I don't know if this is controversial at all. I don't know where this person ranks.
I always really struggle when I'm playing Persona 5, with the footer burst secure stretch of the game. The sort of hacker who's, she never leaves the outside, she never leaves her room, she's like a shut in. Immensely bad hang in that game.
But I don't know if that's just me not being very sympathetic to an unfortunate character, who you gradually kind of like draw out of her shell, but.
I agree. Let me just posit something to you, right? You could swap Futaba with the chess girl in Persona 5, and chess girl becomes one of the last party members in the game.
Do you do it?
Yeah. Yeah, why not? What's that could happen?
She's a good hang. Then Futaba could just be one of the many weirdo side characters you go and see. It's like, oh, yeah, it's my computer hacker mate, and I'm going to go hang out with him for a bit, so I can get some more items when I go back into Mementos this evening or whatever, so, yeah.
I would swap in chess girl for sure, but yes. I think that's, it's tough but fair, I would say. Okay, next category, celebrity performance or cameo of notes, Matthew?
This is one of my ones. I wonder if this is a bit tricky for you.
Well, it's a little bit tricky. I mean, whether they count as a celebrity, obviously Shuhei Yoshida, voices an arcade loving, is it a duck or a frog in Promise Mask Agency?
Oh yeah, one of those, yeah.
The thing that owns the arcade, I'm pretty sure that's him. In Pirate Yakuza that came out this year, there's this slightly shades of grey villain character called Rodriguez, who's played by Uyumi Taneda, who is the big villain in Tokyo Vice, that actor, the guy who plays the Yakuza boss, who's like the main villain of Tokyo Vice. And because they put the character's face and voice in the game, it's like a little bit of a thrill again to have a boss fight with like a recognizable face.
You've just been watching in a TV show. I always liked that in the Yakuza game, when someone turns up, I sort of recognize.
They've added our guy show Kasa Matsu from Tokyo Vice to Yakuza Kiwami 3. I mean, that's awesome. I love that.
I'm just counting down. All they need to do is put old Ansel Elgort in there, finish the gang.
I think that's the one I could probably do without, to be honest.
I'm incredibly cursed.
It would have been really funny if in this category you said Jeff Keighley in Death Stranding. That would have been really funny. So I actually put in Yosaku Matsuda from Black Rain, who is the face of Juba Yaku in Onimusha 2.
It's still the thing I know him from because he was a famous Japanese actor but died young, died of cancer at like 40, I think, and Black Rain is actually one of his last films, which is very sad. But they have a history in the Onimusha series of getting real life actors as the face of the different characters. How you might feel about dead actors doing that, that's a bit more of a modern discourse, but no one really cared in 2002 when I was playing this game.
But yeah, I kind of like it as a tribute to him. And then it's got a tribute to his character from Black Rain in this, as like a bonus outfit. I think it's like a whole mode called the man in black mode, and he's dressed like he is in that film.
So pretty cool, really. Pretty cool use of that actor, I think. Penultimate category, Matthew.
Japanese video game character you'd least like to be your significant other.
Lady Butterfly from Sekiro.
I have two picks, and that's one of them, and…
And that isn't just ages. That isn't me just being ages. She's such bad news, and she's got a difficult boss fight.
Bad news? I've got Lady Butterfly from Sekiro, and Pinky from Promise Mascot Agency. So an old lady and a thumb.
That's like, I mean, amazing stuff, really. Well, okay, we've really nothing more to say on that one, really. Final category, Matthew.
I should have made this the Penultimate one, really. Japanese video game character you'd most like to be your significant other.
I mean, this just feels like a minefield, this one.
It does. Maybe we should just say no, abandon it, and never say who it is one way or another.
I've got an answer. Don't worry.
I mean, so do I. But you know, what have you got?
Well, I just, it's just terrible. It's just seedy when I say it, you know. It's one of the party members from Infinite Wealth again.
Oh yeah.
The one that isn't an aging 40 year old guy. It's the lovely heiress, Shatose Fujinomiya. Fujinomiya.
Yeah. She joins your party. She's not like a teenager or anything.
She's like 30.
Yeah. I'm not saying you're going to jail or anything. Like it's just.
