Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how has Idris Elba's hijack been treating you on Apple TV Plus?
Fine, until he tried to send a secret message by annotating a soft drink, which I can't remember who it was, who was saying on Twitter that, why doesn't he just whisper stuff? It is a very strange show about Idris Elba being on a hijack plane, where the rules of how you can behave on the plane seem to change minute to minute. Sometimes he's running around all over the place, and sometimes it's so locked down that you have to send the aforementioned coconut water memo back to a second class.
Yeah, every now and then, I'm reminded, just watching bits of it, that this should just be a film. Like many TV shows now, it should just be a 100-minute film released in like 2006, but now it has to be like the seven-hour-long episodes, and it's just, you really feel the pinch of it with some shows, and that feels like one of them. Do you think that's fair?
Yeah, I think so. I can sort of see why they padded it out, you know, to give character arcs to, like, everyone involved, but you're really only interested in Indris Elba and the hijacker, the main hijacker. Yeah, I mean, I quite like a plain hijacked story.
I quite like people running around in those spaces, as people will learn if they listen to our Excel episode on best levels. There's some plain chat in that.
That's it. If you want to hear Matthew's thoughts on all levels and games based in Air Force One, then that is the pod that you want. patreon.com/backpagepod, Â£4.50 XL tier.
Great ad there, Matthew. I just went to London with our pal Jay Bayless, actually. And I went to one of those NQ64 sort of pubs.
Well, I say pub. It's kind of like a weird hybrid between...
I don't know what that means.
It's like a gaming bar, right? So it's got loads of arcade machines, but also a few games consoles set up. So basically emulation devices.
You can click to go back to a main menu and then just pick up a ROM from a bunch of different ROMs. And I saw a couple who were definitely born after the year 2000 just trying to understand original GTA in that bar. And you could just see them driving one taxi very slowly into a building, not understanding how the top-down element of it works at all, then walking away in total defeat.
That was my highlight of that day.
Oh, they didn't even run over the monks.
No, exactly. I don't think they even got steering down. And I was like, yeah, of all the games to go back to from that time, top-down GTA has got to be like up there as one of the toughest, you know.
So, yeah. But do you know what? I did play for the first time.
I never played this before. I played Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. So, we did versus in that, because you've heard of that before, right?
Like Street Fighter is a puzzle game. And it kind of is like a version of, you know, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine basically, but like competitive, with like little chibi Street Fighter sprites and Darkstalker sprites fighting each other on screen. That game is fucking amazing.
And I'd always heard people talk about how good it was, but it's only sat there playing it on this deeply illegal PS1 that, you know, 1v1 in person. I just realized how good it was. But the problem is I was really good at playing the short game, like racking up like quick combos of little little ball things and then sending like some trouble J's way.
But then he, because he has like game developer brain, he could think five steps ahead and then my screen would be empty, just have like two little balls and then suddenly be full. And that's like the difference between us really. It's like my very average intelligence versus like game developer super brain.
Yeah, I don't know if you can still, I don't think you can still get that in any modern formats now. I think it's kind of like maybe there was an XBLA version at some point.
It was definitely an XBLA version because there was a little flash where everyone was suddenly interested in it again.
Yeah, yeah. But I feel like it should be perpetually available on Steam. It's just so, it's so, so good.
And yeah, but it was there were a couple of like blokey blokes behind us watching us play this puzzle game. And I thought this is a bit of a weird kind of like collision of worlds. I felt like we were never supposed to cross paths with these people.
They were never supposed to watch us play Super Puzzle Fighter.
Do you think they're now doing a podcast and talking about you like you were talking about the GTA people?
Well, the thing is the vibe of the place is a bit strange because you get those kind of like laddie, kind of guys who I obviously have no time for, you know, naturally. And you get that mixed with like a lot of very young people who definitely would have like never seen the arcade scene in any kind of like good state because they were born after, I don't know, 1997 or whatever.
Right.
And then you also get like dudes who bring their girls there on dates. And there's a lot of like sort of young couples getting off in quarters. It's a very strange clientele.
And then the occasional sort of stag or hen do of people in their like late 30s and early 40s kind of thing.
So I don't think my brain could comprehend like in my left eye seeing two dudes playing Super Puzzle Fighter and in my right eye seeing snogging. I've somehow slipped into two worlds.
What's going on? And also there are no windows. I took a lot of psychic damage from being there, just to be honest.
It sounds, I'm not going to lie, it sounds awful.
It does have a kind of like fluorescent paint aesthetic as well. Just like lots of shiny sort of like it looks like you've got an ultraviolet light on sort of thing. Yeah, I don't know.
It's like the game setup is really, really good. Like it is cool. They got like PS1, GameCube, Smash America, obviously very popular.
They have a Mega Drive there. People just confusingly playing like Sonic 2's 1v1 mode. That's quite strange to see.
And yeah, it was like a good mix of stuff there. But yeah, it did feel a bit like I don't know exactly who this is designed for. Theoretically me, because it has loads of like cocktails that are themed around games.
Any examples?
Oh gosh, I wish I had written down the menu now. That would be pod gold. There was like a Final Fanta something or other.
It was that level of pub.
You know you're in a classy place when they're making cocktails out of Chexnotes Fanta.
I think that's right. NQ64 cocktail menu. I'm determined to get this now.
Let's see. Drinks. What have you got for me?
There we go. It was Final Fanta Rita. We've got Quick Revive Number 5.
I don't really get what that's a reference to. Bulba Sour. That sounds like it'll be terrible.
No alcohol in that one. Weirdly, there's an ET-themed one. I don't get that.
Well, I guess there is that notoriously bad ET game that they buried in the desert.
Yeah, there is.
I wouldn't name a drink after something that's famously shit.
Yeah, there's one that's just called Kirby and there's no pun. That's confusing. But it's got beefy to pink gin in it, which kind of makes sense.
But the worst one, right? And you will love how terrible this is. Dr. Robevnik.
That's got Jack Daniels and Cherry Bourbon blended in it. That sounds like, and Dr. Pepper syrup. That sounds like it would be fucking terrible, to be honest.
Listen, we've got a mailbag coming up. Someone ask us to come up with video game cocktails for mailbag and we'll do it. Yeah, we will.
We'll come up with better puns than that.
Yeah, it's weird, though, because it felt like it actually was actually fine. It was like the least threatening pub you could basically go to because it was just a fundamental understanding that the core audience are basically dweebs, whether those dweebs happen to be, you know, me and Jay Bayliss playing Puzzle Fighter or like a dude and his girlfriend getting off in the corner. A lot of people who just haven't seen Sunlight for a while kind of like that sort of vibe.
So, yeah, it was good. So that's what I've been up to, Matthew.
But while you were spending time with real friends, I've been playing a bit of Videoverse. Lucy's absolutely brilliant new game. Lucy came on, talked about visual novels on the pod, and she released this game, which she talked about there, which is sort of set in a kind of fictional console, kind of like a version of Miiverse.
And it's all about like online communities. And I got yesterday, it just tickled me the idea of you being with all these real people while I was getting quite kind of involved with these fictional friends and like, oh, they've messaged me. Yes, I'll message them back.
But I'm having a great time with that. Looking forward to talking about that at a later point once I've played a bit more.
Yeah, yeah, I bought that too. I heard a rumour that we had got a special thanks in the credits, Matthew, I don't know if that's true or not, but that's quite nice.
There you go, we're going up in the world.
Jay says he put a special thanks for us in like an original version of the credits, and then we got cut out of it, Metroid Dread style. We just weren't part of the finished cut. No, I was like, you don't have to put me in there, we didn't do anything.
You came on a podcast, we got some good content out of it too. We all won in that equation. Yeah, I know I'm looking forward to playing video first, I'm guessing that's a good fit for the Steam Deck as well.
It's mouse controlled, so I don't know what the button controls are like.
Okay, yeah, I suppose we got the trackpads, right? So I'll give that some thought then. Okay, good.
This podcast then, lots to talk about. Best Games of 2016. These are kind of our flagship podcasts, even though I fully acknowledge that we do them a lot slower than we used to.
I think that's partly because we got through all of the years where there was probably the content that would be of most interest to people, or at least it feels that way to me and you, Matthew. Is that fair? Because we did, we started in 2006 and we've worked our way forwards and we've gone through all of our quote unquote glory years of working games media.
And then in the last couple of years, it's meant in a bit more of a bleak sort of end times period. Is there still, are there still rays of hope in these podcasts ahead, Matthew? Or do you think this whole format is a bit doomed by like what happened in the real world in, you know, real time?
I would say like if you haven't felt that bleakness up until now, like 2016 is like definitely someone makes a really bad decision in a video game, starts heading towards the bad ending. And we're kind of very much on that track. The games are still good.
Some fun stuff happens. Like I laughed a lot this year thinking about some of the silly things that happened to me at different times. I think there's still some rays of hope.
The tricky thing with these episodes is that as we do more and more of the podcast, we've covered like more and more of these games. And I looked down my top 10. It's like I feel like I've talked in detail about like maybe eight of these games already.
So you don't want to sound like a broken record and it's harder to sort of surprise people. And I don't know if you found this, but I found myself going, well, shall I like put this in the top 10 just so I've got something else to talk about? But I also wanted to be honest what I actually felt.
Yeah, I think that's true. I think I had a little bit of that where I was like, well, how am I going to talk about unnamed Naughty Dog game from this year, for example, without repeating myself massively? Or, you know, unnamed first entry in a trio of Hitman related, you know, sort of like activities game.
Right.
Like that sort of thing. So, yeah, I have talked about most of these before. Not all of them.
There's a couple of, like two to three exceptions, like you say. But yeah, there's a bit of like sort of territory we've covered a bit. Some stuff I think we haven't talked about, though, since we did the Best Games of the Generation episode, during which a lot of these games did appear.
And that was like the first time we talked about them. And that was so long ago now. That's like almost three years ago we did those episodes.
So, yeah, so I don't know. I think people will still enjoy it, who knows? It might be a bit of a remix of existing content.
But it's a strong year, for sure. It's interesting, I think, actually, because I think this year, games-wise, is sort of defined by games that were... some games that were a massive deal and just didn't sell very well, but were excellent.
There's actually about maybe three to four of those on my list, where I was like, these games were not considered a massive success. That's a bit of a contrast to 2015, where I feel like all the games that were really important also sold very well. This year, it's a bit more up and down, where it's like what I would say is the standout game of the year didn't sell to expectations, which was a bit of a crime.
I don't know if you had any broader observations about the year in games.
It's a very good year for a genre which I'm not very invested in, online shooters. Maybe they won't be properly represented. Actually, looking down the list, I was like, I don't know if it's quite an all-time year, but it's a pretty amazing year.
My specific tastes were well-cated for, but I think you could have other people make a separate top 10 list and have no crossover at all.
I'm sure neither of us have picked Overwatch, right? Right, yeah. That is probably the big deal from this year, isn't it?
In terms of a new type of competitive shooter that absolutely exploded and definitely led to the creation of more like it, in terms of hero-driven shooters in other games, kind of like taking that MOBA approach to character design but then making the game super accessible and people were really buzzing for it. I remember just what a huge deal Overwatch was. But pass me by, you also got Dark Souls III, which was the first of the HD era from...
Well, sorry, well, specifically Dark Souls games. So that was also a massive deal because that was also obviously a Miyazaki-directed one. I understand that Dark Souls II is a slightly contentious game, or people have sort of different takes on it.
It's not necessarily considered an outright one of the best, whereas III, I think, III, I believe, is. So those games will not be represented in our podcast. The only other is Matthew.
I can remember on the mag telling Tom Stone, our staff writer, like, hey, Tom, have you played any Dark Souls? And he was like, no, no. I was like, well, you'll be reviewing Dark Souls III in like two months.
So, you know, best best get yourself learned.
A little insight to the Matthew Castle management style there. Just like, yeah, I'm going to make this sound like free will. And then you will later learn it is not free will.
That kind of situation. Very good.
We just we made him become a Dark Souls guy and it worked.
These are the, you know, the fires in which staff writers are forged. It's just the reality of it, isn't it? Sometimes you just got a bluff.
That's what's going to happen.
Yeah.
Good for Tom. OK, so I suppose that, Matthew, I don't think there's anything necessarily more to say about the shape of the year, because I think we're going to get to a lot of it when we when we go through the three stuff in this preamble and then obviously when we get to our list. So how was your 2016 personally, Matthew?
This is the year I left print media and went to work for Xbox on. I was trying to think back to like what specifically happened because, you know, I was working on XM and being the editor of it for like a year and a bit. Obviously I'd inherited that mag from John Hicks and the London team when they closed the London offices.
So that was always a little bit of a didn't sort of see it coming, you know, I didn't set out to be an to be an Xbox magazine person. And then Rich Keith, who was used to be one of the publishers of Future and had gone over a managerial role to the Yogscast, which was obviously the popular YouTube outfit. And he approached me saying, we're going to get this contract to make the official YouTube channel for Xbox UK.
We're looking for like an editorial brain to head it up. I imagine he came to me simply because I was on official Xbox magazine. I don't think I was particularly known to Rich necessarily, like I never really worked with him.
There may be other people who may have been even hungrier for such a thing had he approached them, but he approached me. My natural instinct was to say no, because I'm a print guy, not a video guy. It just feels doesn't feel like a natural fit.
And then and this is going to sound this is going to sound quite overblown and I hope it doesn't sound hand-wringing. Basically when the EU referendum happened this year, it kind of rewired my brain a bit because I realized that my fate was in the hands of a load of fucking idiots and it didn't really matter how many sensible decisions I made. Outside forces could come and wreck my life if they wanted.
So I thought fuck it, I'll throw caution to the wind, which I would never have done. I genuinely don't think I would have done this move if that hadn't happened.
I didn't know that. I didn't know that was part of the thinking.
It was just a big shift, you were like, well, it doesn't matter what your personal plans are, these things can happen. When I say Brexit wrecked my life, and that's obviously a preposterous thing to say, but more like I was so disillusioned with the state of the nation and the state of the world that I thought, you know, I've really got nothing to lose and I can make these decisions, which are actually like, I don't know if that's a smart way to do things. I still don't know if in the end if I made the right move.
I know obviously it's defined my life since then and I'm now a video person. I do wonder, should I have held out and tried to go online? Should I have tried to stick in traditional games journalism rather than going into basically client consumer facing marketing, which was what Xbox One was?
So that's like a huge, you know, to go from like endgamer to that is quite a violent shift.
Yeah, I think like actually when I think about why I left Games Media, it's because I sort of found, I found that like I've gotten so far from what the original job was at times when I was writing like deals posts and stuff for Black Friday that I was like, this isn't actually close to what I got into doing this for. And so I might as well do something else. And yeah, also, the thing is, though, I think you did make the right call because you doubled your skill set.
You went from being someone who could just make print magazines to someone who could make online videos. And that is a far more valuable skill set to have in the modern world. You know, yeah, that's just true.
That is true, though. I wasn't taught it at all. Like, I just had to, like, guess at it and learn it.
And this isn't me saying it wasn't properly supported by the oddscast, but like, you know, that was a network of YouTube creators, of self-made, mostly young people who'd exploded on YouTube, which is a very different world to you're trying to make this editorial channel for Xbox. You know, because you had PlayStation Access was obviously exploding, which is the PlayStation equivalent, and Xbox just wanted a bit of that. They'd already been doing the channel for a couple of years with another company.
The first few months, I won't lie, were like, incredibly hard about the worst I've ever felt about like myself and work, because I was just having a constant panic attack. I had all these people looking to me and it's like, I genuinely don't know how to do this. Like I don't know what works.
I don't know anything about YouTube. I couldn't really consume it. I wasn't interested in video.
It really was a very ill thought out decision and in the office we had like hosts who were contracted, but they weren't in the Bristol offices at Yogscast. So in the office it was me and our video editor Adrian. And often we'd be just out in the car park, because Adrian was a smoker, so he was always out there having cigarette breaks.
And I was always out there just having a fucking meltdown to him, while he'd sit there observing me, you know, coolly, through a haze of cigarette smoke, and thinking like, what the fuck am I doing? What have I done? It was just really full on and quite scary.
Yeah, I think I remember being bummed when you left, because I was like, well, you know, Matthew was really fun to work with. Was it like towards the end of the 2016 that you moved on?
Yeah, I think it was about October. But like the first big game we covered on the channel, the first big beat that we had to hit was like Gears 4. So around that time, actually, I think Forza Horizon 3 was the very first thing we covered.
So it's definitely after Gamescom, because I think I knew I was leaving when I went to Gamescom. So I had this really great, like, I don't give a shit Gamescom, which is where we were sharing a room. And I think it was good fun because I didn't give a shit.
Yeah, I probably gave you like a slightly wrong impression of how I usually am.
It's sort of like a bit of that. Yeah, obviously, this is the famous Gamescom where your knee shattered. You fell over and smashed your knee.
The breaking of that knee was very much the forging of our friendship, I think. Like it was, you know, the knee died so that the friendship may live. There was that kind of vibe to it.
The thing is that, yeah, so I remember that you were redesigning. Did that launch this year, the redesign?
Yeah, so we redesigned the mag. Obviously, when I did that, I had no inkling that this video ship was coming up. Even though I didn't feel like it was the most natural fit, me and OXM, you know, being able to take a bit of ownership of it and try and make it a better mag.
It had a lot of the values that I think I fundamentally have. It was very much like a writer's magazine. There was a lot of space for people to kind of have interesting, you know, interesting opinions.
Like, we retooled news to be less reliant on the news and a bit more kind of opiniony and kind of gimmicky, which was fun. We had the famous barrel watch column in which we reviewed barrels from various games. And Tom Stone took that column on and like ran with it and created this like quite weird sort of backstory for the figure who was reviewing them, who was this sort of like barrel obsessive.
These were like ten word captions and just through five ten word captions a month you began getting this weird image of what this barrel guy was all about and he'd been to some kind of barrel university and it just it basically hinged on the word barrel being funny to us and being said a lot. Looking back on them this morning, you know, they were pretty solid mags. They've got big, this mag hasn't got a big freelance budget energy because there's like a lot of me, Tom and Alex Dale in it.
Like you just see our faces a lot in that magazine. Yeah. I was pretty pleased with the redesign.
We had some team issues that I don't want to go into, which were a bit rough, which kind of took a lot of the fun out of that, unfortunately, but yeah, you know, it was fun. Yeah. I remember when we redesigned it, we had a launch party for it.
I remember thinking like a launch party, like no one gives a fuck. That's going to be weird. Why would, why would we be doing that?
Like this feels like it's going to be embarrassing and listener, it was. I think they did it to coincide with like rest because they were like, oh, the industry will be in London for rest. So let's, let's one evening, let's have like a drinks thing in this bar in London.
They hired out the downstairs space for OXM. We made these quite nice invites and sent them out to all of our industry contacts and they had boxes and boxes of the first issue. So we had all these magazines and we kind of put them all out on the tables downstairs in this bar.
And so few people turned up for the launch party that the bar started reclaiming bits of the room for like normal customers because it's like, well, there's no one here and you're not really like spending any money on, on the drinks because there's no one here to have drinks. So members of the public would come down and just find these tables with loads of copies of OXM and I could just see people like taking one look at it and then like basically tossing it in a nearby bin or like just people grouping them all together and shoving them into a pile in the corner. In front of your eyes, you could just see like, this will never be a thing anyone's interested in.
Like, yeah, this is truly over. Like this brilliant visual metaphor for like where print was at that time. Just a load of young Londoners who want to have a drink on Friday night, throwing mags in the bin.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, that's wild. Yeah, I did.
I'd redesigned the mag the year before. 2015 was like my best year on PC Gamer for sure, the mag part. And it was really good.
We redesigned it, won the GMA. The mag was selling pretty well. 2016 was a bad year.
It was a bad year for like the real world reasons. Obviously there was the US election and Brexit at the same time. And that was that moment was very much the solidifying of like half of mankind is out to get you basically.
So that was a tough year. That was just like, oh God, oh dear God, that was like what was going on in the real world. On the magazine, it was like, I was really proud of the product we were making.
We had to launch an event this year, like it was like someone above me had like an objective to like launch a games event and it had to be a PC gamer event. So we launched a PC gamer Weekender in London, did three of them. And that required a massive energy and time investment from me alongside still making the magazine, which I don't think is that uncommon in the in like how games events get made like I think that a lot of I think EGX is very dependent on its editorial stuff for for elements of that.
But I just personally felt like I didn't have the stamina for the event and the magazine and online and the bits of online I was doing. I think I just get like a bit chewed up in the machinery of it this year. I was really proud of the event though.
I thought it was pretty good like for what it was. So it was, I don't know, it was like not a very fun year. The only mag that was really thriving at this time was the official PlayStation magazine and everyone else was just like trying to trying to stay afloat and it was just not fun, just not fun at all.
I remember being in like cover meetings and editors meetings or whatever where PlayStation had a really mega selling issue this year with Spider-Man on the cover because it had Spider-Man. I can remember basically people saying like, yeah, what you guys need to do is to have like your Spider-Man cover and you're like, we don't have that, you know, like the game doesn't exist, you know, we only have the games we have. We might not have a Spider-Man.
It was just so obvious that PlayStation 4 was like running away with the generation at that point.
Yeah.
We cannot compete as official Xbox magazine. I cannot make a Spider-Man happen on this machine. I had my minor revenge.
Actually, I say minor revenge, this isn't revenge at all. When we had our launch event, we had this standee made, right? You know, one of those ones that you kind of pull up from the base, an advert for like the new look Alex M.
And I used to just come in early and put that up in official PlayStation's area all the time. I just like the idea of them coming in and having this obnoxious standee. Like that was my tiny rebellion, was to try and like wind up Matt Pellet with a big advert for Alex M in his workspace.
That's funny. Yeah, it was just like, it just got, the print media did just get less and less fun as it went. No one knows what to do to make magazines sell, or they would have done it, and no one has.
And loads of like big magazines have closed regardless of what they've done. The idea of like anyone thinking they're some kind of cover guru, being like, I can diagnose your problem and give you suggestions, mate, you are just one more person guessing like I am. And all we can do really is our best work.
And so there were some good bits too. Like we got got a new deputy editor on the magazine, got Phil Savage, who was really, really good. He was sort of like, definitely like, you know, a different sort of like vibe.
And we worked really well together really easily together. And we came up with one of our legendary parodies of the division, Back Page kind of covers, Matthew, for for this, this year. So we did like basically a parody of Tom Clancy kind of like fiction.
The first one was pretty good. The second one we did for Division Two was excellent, I think. So definitely some good some good issues we had this year.
But yeah, it was just tough, man, tough, burned me out. And I don't know, I could definitely see the gray hairs popping in by the end of this year. I was looking back at some photos and I looked, I had definitely had some brown hair hair at the start of the year that was gone by the end.
Yeah, this year is definitely the start of like weight gain for me. Because Yogscast had like free drinks, which Future never had. And they had a they used to have a free cabinet of Phentamons.
That stuff's just like pure sugar water, you know, and I remember developing a Phentamons cherry cola habit at Yogs. Also they were just across the road from Five Guys, which at the time we didn't have one in Bath. So that seemed very exotic.
I had loads of those. I learnt quite late that Yogscast could get free Five Guys, right? Just because they were like famous, but obviously I wasn't like creator famous.
It was really weird working there. I went in with a little bit of like these people are the enemy, because YouTubers were like replacing all forms of media. And so you were like aware of, you know, these people make more in a year than I've made in my entire career, and I felt like I'd worked really, really hard for that quite lowly result.
And it was a bit of an eye opener in terms of like how hard people did work, or the art to it and the effort that went into it. And a lot of my kind of perceived notions were wrong. It was quite exciting working, even though I was on this quite corporate contract there, to be able to say I work at the Yogscast.
Back then, it was still quite a big deal to people. I can't remember, but this year I got engaged to Catherine, and I remember buying an engagement ring and talking to the lady in the shop. I said, Oh, I work here at the Yogscast.
And she was really like, do you know this person? Do you know that person? She was like genuinely starstruck just by that association, which is something I'd never had on print ever.
Like 1% of the taste of what it's like to be in that world.
Right, right.
Man, the 100% version. They used to come out at lunchtime and they used to have quite a big stalker problem. They'd beat these weird boys hanging around outside the front door and you could come out and you could see a bit of a...
Because it was me and not like fucking Lewis or Ken or Duncan or someone. And you were like, oh, sorry, I'm too boring for you, you fucking psychos.
You have to tell people like, oh, the weird man in the red coats out front or like, you know, fucking hat boys back or whatever.
At least you don't have to be nice to those people though. You're like, well, you know, at best you're going to be like stalkery, at worst you may kill me. So like, you know, you don't have to be that nice to those people, I don't think, you know.
Yeah, that's why I'm very bizarre. So, yeah, okay, that's really funny. I didn't know that much of a problem that was.
But hey, you did at least get to work near Sandwich Sandwich, Matthew.
Yeah, well, that's once they moved, that was, that's a story for next year when they moved offices and we were next to Sandwich Sandwich. That's when like I took my white game really up a gear.
Good, we'll look forward to that in Best Games of 2017. Okay, so this was the famous Gamescom You Destroyed Your Knee, Matthew. How was your Gamescom and E3 this year?
Do you remember enjoying these?
There was quite a lot to talk about, you know, Xbox had kind of come with Xbox Series S and Scorpio, so all of a sudden you had this almost like next-gen hinting conversation going on, which kind of came out of nowhere. That was quite exciting. I remember playing some good stuff, but also like knowing, I think even by three maybe the conversation started about Xbox On.
So, there was this slight back of my head going, well, this might not be me in a few months. E3 was quite hard work, we were on a deadline, I remember like doing a full day of E3 previews and interviews and then going back to the hotel room just to check pages. For some reason, Future put us in like a kind of party hotel, sitting there checking the spelling of fucking Sherlock Holmes one page review or whatever while you can out the window, you can see like beautiful LA people dancing around a swimming pool.
If it wasn't on the way out then, that would have definitely have kind of pushed me further along that line. I think I interviewed Cameo again at that E3 and every time I interviewed Cameo, he was always very sleepy and it was always about scale bound. Obviously in hindsight, you know that it was fucked, but there was always a slight indication of something wrong with this or something up here, just from the way they were talking about it.
I interviewed the head of Microsoft Game Studios, Shannon Loftis, who was really interesting, like super switched on and looking back at OXM, this period, I actually think we were quite confrontational for an official magazine. I didn't feel we were just parroting lines and in a lot of interviews, especially with like Microsoft people, there's always one or two questions which I'm surprised we asked given we were an official magazine. I was very hooked on this idea that the Xbox management had all basically come up through the company and had been there since the original Xbox and they were all a bit hung up on what had worked back then.
Was it Voodoo Vince got remade, remastered?
Right.
This is just nostalgia from people who were there. This thing didn't actually matter. So the idea of going back to it seemed very worrying to me.
They just shut like Lionhead, they'd shut down Press Play who made Max and the Magic Marker and Kalimba. They'd cut out quite a lot of interesting stuff just before and then all of a sudden it was all a little bit re-core and you were like, are you guys making good decisions here? Is this good?
And we did ask these questions, which I actually like I was surprised we were bold enough to do that. You know, you think we'd just be like, fuck yeah, Scorpio.
Yeah, that sort of makes sense. I've got some broader thoughts on Xbox, Matthew, that I'll save as we recap the entries of this year, but I think that's pretty much kind of like where they were at. I think they were just trying to do damage control after the bad launch.
And then I feel like maybe maybe I guess like some of these games are probably in the post even like back at this far back as 2013. But yeah, I do remember it's like, this is one of the starkest comparisons between E3 lineups this year for sure. But I suppose like the one thing you could say about Scorpio is that it felt like it was Microsoft trying to course correct from the Xbox One original launch by saying, this is our vision of what great hardware looks like.
And it's sort of the approach that they would also take to how they made like Series X and S I guess, where it's like these are games machines and they're very powerful ones and the proposition is very straightforward. There's no random ports on the back. It's just like, this is our vision of like a great games machine.
And I suppose they probably also thought, in this era where PlayStation's running far ahead of us, we can at least say we've got the most powerful console on the market, which is what they ended up doing. I remember nothing from these Gamescom and E3s, Matthew. I was at E3 2016, but the only photograph evidence I could find of it were pictures of just the rad like Bethesda stands where they had a sort of a replica of the Spaceship from Prey, Talos 1, they built one of the Clockwork Knight things from Dishonored as well, Clockwork Swordsman, so I was just taking pictures of cool stuff there, but I don't remember a single interview I did or a preview or anything like that.
I think these might have been like bust, kind of like Gamescoms and E3s for me. I think I might have just been like, oh, I'm at the wrong appointments and not getting the right stuff. I just don't remember anything that memorable coming out of it.
Gamescom was definitely dominated by my knee being absolutely fucked. I tripped over in the car park on the first day, like, you know, pacing to try and get to my first appointment. So about half an hour before the kind of the show was due to open.
And it was one of those like very bad grazes. It just took off like the front of the knee. And so it was bleeding very, very heavily.
It was just a very big knee wound. I remember thinking I have to go to these appointments. But this is also a very substantial amount of like...
Visually, it looks terrible because it was all running down my knee. I was wearing like three quarter length shorts. And it was like bleeding through my shorts and like running down my shin.
And it's like, no, I have to find a first aid person. And I don't speak any German, but trying to sort of, you know, just going up to people and then pointing down to my fucking horror show of a knee. The crowds to get into Gamescom is there's always just a fucking scrum.
It's a nightmare. But all you have to do is start limping when your knee's covered in blood. And it's amazing how quickly people part for you.
Someone's like, fuck, this guy's going to bleed on me. Yeah, I found a first aid guy. He bandaged it up.
He also poured loads of that brown healing shit on it. What's that? You know, that disinfectant stuff.
So it was kind of like bleeding through the bandage plus this like brown shit, which just made it look like it was like an evil septic wound. Like you couldn't have got like a Hollywood makeup artist to make it look fucking gnarlier than it did.
No, it was the grimest thing I've ever seen.
And the funny thing was like when you go to Gamescom, obviously you have the consumer show where you have all the big stands like you'd probably recognize from E3 or whatever. And then you have the business center, which is a load of enclosed spaces like temporary kind of like cubicles get put up. But some people go out of their way to like dress them up and make them quite luxurious so that when you're in there having a presentation, you know, it feels like you're in the company of, you know, a company that's spending big.
And my first appointment was to see Forza Horizon 3 at the Xbox stand. And Xbox, like, they'd all done it up with like white carpets and like white sofas. Everything was white.
And then here I come, just fucking spewing all this shit out of my knee. And I could see them all being like, oh, this guy's going to fucking bleed all over our stand. And sitting down in the little demo room for Forza Horizon 3 and Ralph Fulton, the creative director at Playground.
I don't think I'd formally met before sitting there and then like, I didn't bleed on their carpet and sofa. But through the whole presentation, I could see eyes nervously looking at my knee. That's my big memory of Gamescom, is people looking at my knee going, is that knee going to spray blood everywhere?
It was gnarly as hell. Like it was. And also, but it was what was funny about it was how much you insisted on talking about it and narrating what had gone wrong.
And just talking about your life with the knee. That was what was funny about it. It became part of your personality that week.
The thing is, yeah, I mean, we hung out quite a bit. We knew each other from the office, but like the knee stuff made you laugh. So I was like, well, I'm obviously going to keep talking about this knee to Sam, because he's obviously really into this, which is the right call.
What made me laugh was that it had made enough of the impact on people who were doing demos, that they were then bringing it up to other journalists. Because then I'd meet people like later in the day who I hadn't met up until that point. I remember being with Tom Phillips from Eurogamer.
And he's like, oh, wow, it is as bad as they say. And we're like, what? This cannot be the breakout story of Gamescom, that there's this guy going around bleeding everywhere.
Yeah. I've definitely said this on the podcast before, but the funniest bit was when I went to a Koch media mixer, and then you were lying on the bed recovering the day after we'd been to Gamescom. And you just went, are you leaving to get away from the knee?
And I just went, no, in this very unconvincing way because I did eye it sideways because we were staying in the same hotel room. And yeah, that was really funny. The idea I just had to not be in the same room as them.
Yeah, very funny. That has overpowered all my memories of that Gamescom. The only other things I remember are having an interview for FIFA Story Mode and thinking, why am I here?
This makes no sense. I'm here doing this because I'm completely out of my depth. Interviewing a guy about Titanfall 2, that was pretty good.
And asking him about the single player mode, which they had there. I don't think I ever used that copy anyway, though, which is kind of a bummer. And then going to a Battlefield 1 demo with Jake Tucker, who I can't remember which outlet he was with at the time.
And then just being like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here either. Loads of appointments where I was like, I'm just out of my depth playing these games I don't really understand. I do remember Battlefield 1 having those cool big vehicles in them, though.
That was quite a fun demo game. It was it's actually impossible to get your arms around like what a 32 or 64 person first person shooter is in like a 30 minute press demo. It's a complete waste of time.
But that's that's always the mad thing about those demos at Gamescom or E3 for Battlefield, because they inevitably go, let's have the full 64 players or whatever. So you go into a room and there are like 64 demo stations set up. And then you have to wait for like enough journalists or enough people to turn up for them to start the match.
It's always a huge ball ache. There's never no one ever knows what they're doing. You never get to play a proper game of it.
Lots of people running around being scared and then a fucking blimp turns up and starts raining down fire on everyone. What the fuck is going on? But it's like there is quite I do quite like the sort of the theatre of going into a room and seeing like all those PCs.
And you're like, at least they know like where their games at its best. It's quite a ballsy kind of statement of intent.
Yeah. Also, people just seem very up for it. They seem very up for the well, it was like World War One, but it was kind of made up World War One, wasn't it?
It was like just why is there a big train that's got loads of guns on it? That's not what happened then. It was kind of like it's very wild, impressionistic version of World War One, wasn't it?
And so you could ride horses.
That was quite fun.
Yeah, it was it was it seemed pretty cool. But yeah, I just I just felt completely out of my depth. So that was a weird one where I found there were loads of games I liked from this year.
But I don't think I I don't think a single game on my list actually went to like a press demo for. I don't think I ever end up doing that. So in some ways I was just I was just having I was probably completely mismatched with all my appointments basically, which is which is tough.
But oh well. So Matthew, what was on the cover of OXM this year? What gives us a kind of like, you know, an idea of where things were at the time?
Doom, Watch Dogs 2, Battlefield 1, Gears 4, Final Fantasy 15. The year before we'd had big success with Fallout 4 and Battlefront 2. There wasn't really anything of that scale, but we were desperately trying to find like what is the next one of these.
So we were just, you know, trying out lots of different games. If any of them have exploded, we would have done like two or three covers of them. But we never did.
I think it is pretty much a year of like every issue is a different cover, which is an indicator of a mag. Slightly struggling to find something that really does the business. I was really pleased with our Final Fantasy XV issue.
We did a kind of crappy version of what Edge did in that where they got to interview like all the Final Fantasy teams about every Final Fantasy game. We just got a load of writers we liked to write their personal thoughts on every Final Fantasy game, which doesn't like break any new grounds. But I think you wrote about Final Fantasy VII for us.
Oh, right. I vaguely recall that.
You definitely contributed to this issue unhelpfully. We didn't put names on any of it. So there was quite personal accounts, but you have no idea who wrote any of it.
I also did like a 20 page feature on Final Fantasy XV. If I got really good access, I'd just go absolutely mad and do like these huge multi-tiered. It was like a feature made up of like five mini features, which I think I stole from OPM started doing these.
Matt Pellet was quite into this format of like rather than one, like 2000 word feature or 3000 word feature, you do five 800 word features about like individual sort of pillars or whatever of the game. So I did like the open world, the combat, the characters. I think I did the wider Final Fantasy XV extended multimedia thing.
So like we interviewed the guy who directed King's Glaive and things like that. So yeah, we really went to town on it. I felt like that was a that's probably like one of the best issues of XM idea.
Just because it was full of all my smart friends talking about games that they really loved. Also, like for whatever reason, like Rich Stanton was back on the freelance scene at that time. So there's quite a lot of writing from him in the mag, which is always a treat.
That's good. That seems like, you know, like you got some good issues there to sign off from your time on print media. That's pretty cool.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah. I sort of like our year we had like Dark Souls 3 on the cover, No Man's Sky. Obviously a big deal this year.
Turtle War Warhammer, which was massive when that came out, obviously. Dawn of War 3 that was announced this year. And we had an exclusive on that, like a world exclusive, which was cool.
Did The Son of Two twice, actually went to the well back, back to the well twice. And I think it's because we got to the end of the year and there's suddenly no new stuff to cover. And it became a bit of a nightmare to make them act.
And then we did like a I did like a Gwent cover with a picture of Geralt, which I thought would be quite quite good. And I think it actually like did quite badly that one. I think it did maybe I think it did ultimately lead to that little statue we got sent of Geralt in the bath with a copy of PC Gamer though, because it was Gwent on the cover of that one.
So that worked out right. So yeah, yeah, Deus Ex Mankind Divided, we tried Quake Champions. Don't think anyone bought that one.
Dear God, what a rough year that was.
We did this absolute rip off of a PC Gamer feature. I don't know if it was from this year or the year before, but someone, maybe Chris Thurston, had done like a month of only using a laptop instead of a gaming PC.
Right.
Does that ring a bell?
I don't know if it happened when I was running the Mac, might have been even before that.
But it was kind of like a, hey, here's an interesting thing. Like, what is it like if your sole PC is this laptop? And so I thought, oh, could we do something similar about like, what happens if your only source of entertainment or like, your only electronic device you could interact with is an Xbox One?
Which is obviously something that would never happen. Like, you cannot equate an Xbox One with a laptop. So we did this feature where Tom Stone tried to live on Xbox One for a month.
It was largely faked. He obviously didn't do this because it's a preposterous concept. But the idea was like, could you use it as a computer, like a web browser?
It was mainly to go into how beyond games there were a lot of weird apps being added to the machine. It was just an excuse to make a lot of jokes about Tom only being able to eat pizza because there was a Domino's Pizza app that they added to Xbox One. So in the concept of this feature, all he could eat was food that he could order through an Xbox One.
Which should have been the clue that it was fake and not a real thing. Because he obviously could have died. We did this photo shoot of Tom slowly going mad in his quote unquote living room.
But it was actually in my living room. I've just moved into the house that I'm in now. We did all these photos of him like exercising and eating pizzas and all this kind of shit.
And it wasn't until we got to deadline day that I was looking at all the pictures and realized that we hadn't taken down all my family pictures in the room. So it looked like Tom lived in this house where he had all these pictures of me and Catherine on the shelves. And he was just like, no one would ever notice that.
But it was like a big in-joke on the mag of Tom living in this house with all his pictures of his boss and his boss's girlfriend. There were some fun bits in amongst all the Brexit.
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I don't want to sound like I'm totally down this year because I think I've discussed all the depressing stuff now.
I remember that feature being pretty good as well. I remember reading that because I think you told me that you're quite happy with it. I remember pictures of a very depressed looking Tom doing press ups and stuff and thought this is a guy who's been properly living this stuff right in life here.
Matthew's putting him through the flames.
What I loved about Tom is you could say we're going to do this and he'd just go and do it. When we interviewed him, his application was very much like he was applying for Endgamer. He was a big fan of Endgamer.
It was clear that he was a big fan of Endgamer and that style of magazine more than OXM. I think he knew me and Alex Dale from the mag, from Endgamer. So, you know, it was more like I really want to work with you Endgamer people on a thing, whatever that thing may be, which obviously like speaks to me because I'm like, you know, a vain monster.
I just wish we could have worked on like a Nintendo mag with him because OXM was super dry by comparison to those Nintendo mags. But he brought a lot of good jokes to it.
I remember thinking it was such a boring Xbox time to do a mag redesign as well. I felt bad for you. Like, this is just, it's so dry.
This whole, all of this turf is like, I don't know, it's like Astro turf.
It felt a bit desperation though, you know, like they were like sales were going down and OPM was still being was still quite strong. So let's just let's just have something. Let's try and have a beat where we can like talk about OXM in a more positive way.
And our art editor Mark Wynn is like a magazine art design genius. So like having him on it, like it was it was it was an amazing, like I love doing that redesign and being at the heart of it and working with with really super talented team on it. But see earlier story about Launch Party.
Okay, then let's get to what the different companies are up to this year. So I tend to always do a recap of E3. We're coming up to like the end of Sony's E3s here, actually, despite the fact that they started getting really good at them at this time.
So E3 2016. Sony's conference has fewer magic tricks in 2015. That was the one that had the FF7 remake Last Guardian coming back and showing me three being announced at the same show.
It was ridiculous. But I would say this is their playbook on how they won the generation. Basically, you start with the God of War reveal.
You have Atreus just like sort of playing in the yard and then you see Kratos step out the shadows and everyone in the theater. It's like performed live with this. You got like an orchestra playing live music and it just absolutely comes alive.
The room when this happens, it's just like it seems like a big moment. That's followed by the reveal of Days Gone. And then there was a reveal for the Last Guardian release date.
It's got a big cheer. Horizon gameplay. That was a game that from the earliest time they announced what Horizon Zero Dawn was, it just captured people's imaginations and they really wanted it.
You had Detroit Become Human, which as ever with Quantic Dream is a contentious game, but it's probably, I think to a lot of people, it's considered their strongest work. And so that's obviously another PS4 exclusive. This is the year where PSVR launches.
You have a lot of that this year. But then you actually get to the end of the conference and they still have more stuff. They have that Death Stranding reveal where it's like Krabs and Norman Reedus and a baby, which I thought was really dumb.
I think actually that reveal might be why I've still not played Death Stranding, because I was like, what the fuck is this? And I still feel that way a little bit about it. And then but then it ends with you have like Spider-Man on PS4 from Insomniac to end with as well.
So you suddenly have this like, you know, major exclusive, a really obvious opportunity sat there. What if someone made a good Spider-Man game instead of all of these Activision Studios having one year to make bad ones, which is what had been happening for like about 10 years plus with that license. And so you had, yeah, you had Insomniac making this PS4 exclusive game and people were just so up for it.
So to bookend, like to have God of War and Spider-Man revealed in the same conference just feels like, oh my God, that's just a generation winner right there.
I think this is the year where you get the all the Sony first party games are like these over the shoulder weighty things. And I'm thinking a little bit of a shame that God of War couldn't be like its own thing, you know, in its original terms. That was proven to be quite a foolish stance eventually.
Obviously, I love that game. Yeah, I don't know if I could really enjoy it as much just from a like, oh God, we're really struggling in Xbox land. You know, you're kind of like, fuck those guys.
More specifically, people who have magazines about this stuff.
Yeah, the Spider-Man thing looking so good. I mean, it made me laugh because earlier in the year Insomniac made a terrible Metroidvania that year. Do you remember Song of the Deep?
No, I don't remember that.
Oh, it's absolutely baffling. I have no idea what happened here. A really miserable underwater Metroidvania.
I think you play as a submarine. It's absolute garbage. I have no idea why they made it.
For them then to come out and be like, oh, no, here's our big play that everyone's excited about. You're like, oh, god damn it. We've got Song of the Deep on Xbox.
I think Song of the Deep is on everything, but that's an indicator of like what we got from Insomniac and what Sony got from Insomniac was kind of rough. Tempted at all by PSVR at the time?
No, I think because we'd already had VR on PC. We had an Oculus Rift, the very earliest version of it, in the office in 2013. And I tried it and been like, this is definitely cool.
But also I'm going to need convincing that, first of all, I need like one platform to succeed really. So I know it's worth buying games for it. And, you know, that has still not happened in VR.
There's still like a lot of like, that's going to be a nightmare for game preservation VR. Because there are PSVR games on PS4 that no longer work on anything else. So they're going to be lost to time unless they're ported over and not all of them will be.
And then obviously there was like, there was a HTC Vive this year. And I think the first Oculus Rift like proper consumer model launches this year too. So I think PSVR did seem like they did make a very good pitch though.
They had like that Star Wars VR thing here, which everyone said was amazing. The Battlefront X-Wing one. And then there's like, yeah, and then there's like some FF15 stuff.
And I remember like actually going around Louise Blaine's house this year, who worked on GamesRadar, and she had like the, I think like there was maybe an Until Dawn spin-off they did on PSVR that I thought was pretty good. It was like sort of like being on a spooky ride.
Oh yeah, the Rush of Blood, was it?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah, they've just done a similar thing on PSVR too for the Dark Pictures Anthology, where you sort of, it's like ghost houses based on those properties and you shoot targets and ghosts jump up and get up in your grill.
Yeah, I did think PSVR was the best of the VR I'd experienced at that time, because it was like really comfortable headset and really straightforward to get it working. It wasn't a faff to use or anything like that.
The whole camera element of it was a bit of a pain.
That's true, actually. Yeah, that's true. But I don't know, it seemed like it was coming together, but I just wasn't totally won over yet.
Yeah, and still with VR, I still see VR as something that's like a work in progress, but I am invested in its success. I want to see it do well, and I do enjoy VR experiences. But yeah, I didn't jump in at this time.
Did you get one at this time, or was it a bit later?
Yeah, I think I bought one at launch, played Batman, and then never played it again.
Yeah, well, that Batman, I think it was at this Gamescom that I did play Batman Arkham VR, and I was just amazed by it. It was those Rocksteady production values applied to VR, wasn't it? I know it's not a very long game, but as a demo experience, it was one of the best demos I think I've ever had, going into the Batcave and all that stuff.
It was pretty amazing. Yeah, so you have that, Matthew. Then Xbox's conference, you've kind of gone through most of it already, I think, but you have the 1S to start with, so a smaller version of the console.
They do an Xbox Play Anywhere thing, which is like if you buy the game on Xbox, you get it on PC as well. I think they kind of abandoned that after a while.
It's still sort of true, though.
Is it though? Because I think when I bought Master Chief Collection on... Oh, no, I suppose I should have bought them.
Well, a lot of these, I guess what I'm thinking of is a lot of the games are on Xbox and PC Game Pass.
Yeah, that's true.
So I guess you don't technically own them on both, yeah.
Well, I suppose the thing is as well, I'm thinking of it as, I was about to say, oh, I bought Master Chief Collection, but I bought it on Steam, not on Xbox's store. So if I'd have bought it on Xbox's store, I might have owned it on both, maybe. I'm not sure.
Yeah. But it was pretty cool for a while. It still means that when I bought Halo Wars 2, and it still works on my Xbox Series X or my PC, which I think is pretty cool.
So I like that they did this. They were trying to make inroads to PC, I think, to probably partially compensate for the generation being so sort of pear shaped. But they were a bit ahead of the curve on this because Sony now do the same thing.
I bet Sony is making more money from its PC version supports than it is from its own first party line up on PS5 at the moment because that stuff just sells and sells now on PC. I bet Spider-Man has been an absolute fortune on PC. It's basically free money, isn't it?
Once you've done the port, it's like you just make that money forever. So yeah, so they have that. The Forza Horizon 3 reveal, which, you know, that was something that regardless of however Xbox was doing, everyone agreed Forza Horizon was like a cool thing that was happening on those consoles, right?
Oh, yeah. I think this is the one with Wicked Game, the cover.
Yeah, just people were really buzzing for this. I think this feels like it was a bit of a breakout in terms of its popularity as well because this is on PC too. And it just felt like, yeah, people agreed this was something that if you bought an Xbox and you played this, you wouldn't be disappointed basically.
Release date for ReCore, as established ReCore, very lukewarm, kind of like almost like a 360 era exclusive, but it was like an undue amount of attention put on it.
They always played up the armatures from the creators of Metroid Prime because it was some of the creative leads from the original Metroid Prime team set off to make armature, who mainly like a port studio, they did the ports of Metal Gear Solid, didn't they, to PS Vita and next gen consoles. But yeah, that was just such a bust, that game. That's a fucking record, it's a total toilet.
Yeah, so you have that, you have Dead Rising 4 announced, which would ultimately be a bit of a dud and get that studio closed, so quite cursed there. Halo Wars 2 gets a release date. Halo Wars was one of those things.
I actually think this game was maybe two years either way, well, maybe two years later this would have been a bigger deal, but I think it released during some of the roughest times for Xbox in terms of the amount of attention paid to it, but they got Creative Assembly to make the sequel and it was really good. It was a really, really good version of an RTS on consoles. You had Scalebound coming to PC, would eventually get cancelled, of course, for all formats, just gone.
Finally, you had Project Scorpio reveal, which was the 1X. So it feels like it was a bit of a dud, but to be honest, I think for Xbox, them just having a conference where things didn't go wrong, where things didn't get a bad reception was the win at this time because they were just such repair and restore mode, and then they would gradually get better over time, or still a bumpy road, quite still a lot of years to get to this year's E3 era conference where we agreed that they had absolutely smashed it and things are looking very bright for Xbox.
Yeah, nothing damaging. No. And that's like a step forward.
Yeah, it is, it is. But it's hard to contrast that with Sony's conference here, whereas the idea of putting single player games at the center of what you're doing as your sort of overall ethos to these are the games we're making and putting out just seems so wise. It was what people wanted in an age of like multiplayer things and free to play things.
Sony were like, yep, you pay 50 quid and you get the game and the game is good and we put loads of money into it and there's a good story in it because we know that you care about that. Just seemed like such a good playbook, you know? So, yeah, it kind of makes sense to me that they ran away with it.
But Matthew, Nintendo still exists in 2016, allegedly. What were they up to this year? And is it a bit of an Annus Horribilis for them?
It certainly is a horrible Annus. I was so, like, wrapped up with Xbox. I wasn't keeping too much of an eye on them and there wasn't much to see.
I thought, oh, what did, like, Nintendo Life call the best Nintendo games of 2016? And their best Wii U game was Twilight Princess HD, which is like an indicator of where things were. It was all a little bit Star Fox Zero.
It was all a little bit Metroid Prime Federation Force.
Oof.
No, thank you. It's all a little bit Detective Pikachu and Pokken Tournament. I think this is probably the worst, worst year of Nintendo releases has ever been.
There's no volume. The actual quality is super low. They don't make anything, anything anyone truly loves.
One, one 3DS exception. If there's any strengths and any wins, it's on 3DS where I think the, the... Is this Pokemon Sun and Moon?
Maybe? Fire Emblem Fates. Obviously, Fire Emblem was still doing its thing.
People were still into it. It was still kind of quite riding high after its big awakenings reinvention. So that was okay.
But like, it's the intake of breath before Switch. So it feels like inevitable. The reason Switch comes out the gate the way it does and has the games it does is because they're not making games for these platforms anymore.
That does feel super obvious to me, but it is, it is grim. I'd occasionally review things for Games Master. I think I reviewed Twilight Princess HD.
I definitely played it for some reason. But yeah, sad. O&M could not have survived this year.
Yeah, it seems really bad on paper. I think I kind of noticed this when we were doing the Wii U Hall of Fame where we just went through and got, I got to 2016 in the list and it was like basically two games and they were just not a going concern. Obviously they do reveal the Switch this year, right?
That happens in October, I believe. And then for some reason, I always think of the biggest moment of the Switch was when it was on Jimmy Fallon's show because that was right at the end of this year. I think it was like right near where the Game Awards were.
And so you had them showing it on like live US TV and that felt quite savvy. And it felt like there was a bit of buzz of hope about it, you know, and obviously you knew Breath of the Wild was going to happen. That was like in the air, wasn't it?
So yeah, like it started the turnaround, I guess, starts at the very end of the year.
That Switch event was great. I remember taking a day off work to go to it. Odyssey wasn't there.
There were big banners for Odyssey, but you could play Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart was there, Snipperclips was there, One-Two Switch was there. But I can remember sitting there playing like Snipperclips, the kind of two player co-op on a single screen with like each of us with a little controller. I remember talking to other friends and developers were there who'd been working with the console already.
Like they'd had versions of it and it felt really exciting. You were like, oh yeah, this is going to be pretty great. You could just tell it was going to be special.
And, you know, in the meat of realising that I was not very good at making videos about Xbox, to go and have this big dose of exciting Nintendo stuff was kind of rough. You were like, oh, this is going to be good. I wish I could be talking about this instead.
Oh, you perpetually underestimate yourself. You are good at making videos.
I'm genuinely proud of my RPS video work because that was like me. It was me saying my words and what I wanted to say about games. I just don't think there's much that I made for Xbox.
I'd want anyone to watch or to have my name on it, you know?
Right. OK, fair enough. I think like with the learning things, though, I think you end up, what you realize the older you get is that no one really teaches you how to do things and jobs are like most jobs are learning by doing, you know?
So it's OK that you went into it and then just figured it out. Like it's fine. And you've been very successful.
Now you're running another channel and it seems pretty cool, you know? OK, so that's Nintendo and that's what was going on with the E3s more generally this year. A few more big events happened this year.
So, like I say, launch of three VR headsets. That's a big concern. Evolution Studios is shut down by Sony.
They made Drive Club and they went away. Sega for Atlus, which would end up being maybe one of the best acquisitions ever in terms of like things that would pay off in years to come. Future, our employer at the time, bought Imagine Publishing, my old employer.
That was a weird day when that happened. PS4 Pro launches this year. A good version of a PS4, but I don't think any of the upgrades it offered ended up that being that big a deal, really, in retrospect compared to what the PS5 would offer.
You have the NES Classic launch this year too and sell out immediately and become a big speculator market thing. That whole mini console thing started happening. So that was a Nintendo thing that happened this year, Matthew.
Yeah.
And that's pretty much it.
Blindhead shut, of course.
Oh, right. I missed that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was a bummer. So there's a few quiet studio closures that go on throughout this year, but those are the top line ones. The only other two things I was going to mention, Matthew, is I went on a couple of trips this year.
I went on a Mafia 3 trip that was ridiculous and great. That involved they hired a marching band to basically march through. We're in New Orleans.
They marched through New Orleans because the game was set in a New Orleans type setting. On the way to the press trip, that was ridiculous. We went on like this.
Did you have to be part of the parade?
I just walked politely alongside. Just tried to stay out of view while other press were filming it. There was like a boat trip element to it, like a river boat trip and stuff like that.
It was so good though because New Orleans is the type of place you never got to go on a press trip. You always end up going to San Fran or LA or New York. Obviously, amazing privileged positions to be in.
But it means you only ever have a tiniest snapshot of America and New Orleans is so its own kind of place with its own vibe. So that was like an amazing trip to get to do. Yeah, it went like sort of like crocodile, like going past crocodiles on a little boat and stuff like that.
It was pretty full on.
Were you like, live and let die got this all wrong?
There was a, yeah, live and let die definitely presents a different, let's say, interpretation of what, you know, that sort of sort of like Bayou kind of area is like. But yeah, so it was, that was actually an amazing press trip. There are a few images from me on that press trip where I look like I'm having the time of my life.
I look genuinely delighted. I'm on a boat with JJ from GamesRadar and I look fucking like I'm having such a good time.
I need to see this picture. I want to see what that looks like.
It kind of looks like sort of Miami Vice vibes. Like we look like we're sort of little detective duo.
That is the show I would watch, you and James Charles solving mysteries using the skillsets you have now as media people.
Weirdly I bumped into him at NQ64 yesterday in London. He was there with some mates. It was very strange to do that.
But yeah, I like JJ. That was a fun trip. Yeah, so that was good.
And then I also went on the very strange Halo Wars 2 trip I've talked about before in the Ghost Town in Washington. I can't remember what the town's called, but it's like one of these sort of like tech startup towns where they have like a big shopping mall and all the stuff you need to live in a town. But there's like no one there.
There's like no children there. It's like the 343 were basically based there. We went there to play Halo Wars 2 and to have a little tour of their Halo Museum.
And that was that was pretty fun. Although I suppose like the way things have ended up with 343 is I imagine like the vibe of it is quite different these days. But yeah, it's empty mall.
It's like 10 a.m. on a Friday and the mall was empty. There's no one there.
A few people in Starbucks, but no one walking through this giant mall complex where everything was open. It was like a Twilight is an episode where everyone had disappeared. I couldn't sleep and I woke up at 5 a.m.
Went for a walk and found these weird like sort of like barriers at the edge of the town. You just couldn't there was like a road closed and it seemed like the one of the only roads out of town had been closed. And it was I felt like I just felt like I was in some kind of like nightmare worlds because I was like I think just because I wasn't having the best time at work either.
I thought, oh, maybe I'm like, you know, maybe this is like my Silent Hill sort of like retribution place. So I have to like resolve something here in order to leave. That was bizarre, but quite quite a fun one.
I don't suppose you had any other trips Matthew this year?
No, it was it was just all work. I'm in E3 and Gamescom were kind of kind of trips.
Yeah, they were.
The hotel we were in E3. Do you remember Dan Dawkins talking about the fridge which led to a nightclub?
Not really. Do you talk about that on the podcast?
We were all in the same bar. I think he went down and apparently like the hotel we were in had this gimmick where there was like in the kitchen there was like a fridge. And if you open up the fridge, it was actually a door to another secret club.
Only people in the know if you had like a code word, they'd take you into the kitchen and then you go through this fridge into this into this nightclub. Now you have to have Dan Dawkins back on the podcast so he can tell the story properly. But I can remember checking out pages in my room and then hearing about Dan Dawkins going through a fridge into a fucking wonderland.
I'm thinking, well, we're having a very different experience of the C3.
Yeah, that's funny. I feel like I wouldn't have been welcome in the first non-secret nightclub. Never mind the secret ones.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's good.
Okay.
In which case, Matthew, the epic preamble is over. Let's take a break and come back with our top 10 games of 2016.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, we got two top tens of our favorite games of 2016. If you're a new listener, and you just listen to that entire epic preamble, you're like, where the hell are the best games of 2016 in the title?
This is where they are. So, you found them, well done, welcome. It's gonna be good.
Matthew, anything to say about your list before we get started? Like the approach you've taken, things you've left out, that sort of stuff.
I actually did have to cut out quite a lot of stuff I really like. My bottom three or four could probably be different games on a different day, but I'm generally happy with this. I think this is gonna be the least surprising one yet.
So please do keep listening.
Yeah, I've really wrestled with this. I think the honorable mentions actually has some of the juiciest stuff of like, one of these that we've done. Oh, it turned out I played a lot from this year.
I was reasonably prolific in what I was ticking off. And yeah, there's definitely, probably around 29 out of 10 games from this year. It was a really good year.
So yeah, I struggled with it a little bit, but Matthew, do you want to kick off with your number 10?
I'm going to kick off with a very me pick, Zero Time Dilemma.
Here he is. Here he goes.
Here he is, back on his bullshit. I think I have picked each game from the Zero Escape trilogy in each respective year that we've done these episode recaps. This is of course, Kataro Ichikoshi's visual novel series about various groups of people thrust into insane games of death.
This is the third part. Definitely the least loved part, I would say, by the fandom. But I would say even a slightly weaker iteration of Zero Escape is still super thrilling.
Three teams of three find themselves locked in this facility where in order to escape, they have to kill six people. So the other two teams, there is a voting mechanism to get rid of people. There are bracelets which make people forget what happened in the last 90 minutes that go off every once in a while.
I mean, there's all kinds of sci-fi madness in this. There's cloning, there's time travel, there's alternate worlds. There's a lot.
But that's the beauty, I think, of what Uchikoshi does as a writer and a creator. He kind of takes this big soup of stuff, the rules of his death games, and then he layers in sci-fi ideas. He layers in some fantastical ideas.
He puts all these quite weird, incongruous characters in the mix. You don't really know how, like, you know, there's like an old guy, there's a weird boy who's got like a giant metal ball for a head. There's a guy, I think, who worked in an ice cream store.
Like, you're thinking, how the fuck have these people come together? What's the relevance of them? And the beauty of these games is seeing all the parts kind of snap together into this big mechanical hole where he eventually kind of like, through playing it over and over again and doing different branching choices, you realize how the whole thing connects and this big grand network reveals itself.
If it is one of the weaker ones, I actually don't think there's much in it. It has one of like the all-timer twists in it from him. A big perspective twist that just makes you kind of question how you've kind of been interacting with a particular part of this story in a really clever way that I'll never forget.
So zero time dilemma. Don't play it without having played the other two. Nine persons, nine doors, nine hours, and Virtue's last reward first.
Because this does require previous knowledge.
I think weirdly they gave this away on PS Plus for the PS Vita. And so you could just have it. And I was there thinking, but playing this by itself seems like a bad idea.
So I wonder if anyone just tried that and was baffled for several hours. Yeah, I'm sort of like one of the, I suppose it's like one of the two series that you've talked about. I've considered checking out of the back of our Visual Novels chat on this podcast.
Matthew, you certainly made this and Danganronpa sound pretty exciting. So yeah, those feel like the two, you know.
This is less problematic than Danganronpa, this trilogy. And more satisfying is a complete work. Danganronpa games are a bit more standalone.
Like this, you definitely have to enjoy it as a trilogy. Well, another thing I really love about this particular game is it opens with a coin flip. And if the coin flip goes your way, that's just the end of the game.
Like, a villain's like, you know, if I flip this thing, you're going to be trapped in this like insane game, which is then the rest of the game. But if you win the coin flip, you get to just go free and you'll be fine. So I like the idea that it opens with this game of chance about whether the game happens at all, which is quite cute.
That's cool. Yeah, I like that idea. That's a cool notion.
Imagine playing that game, the winning and then being like, was that it? And then just trading it in.
Like how you can finish Far Cry 4 if you just stand there and wait for the guy to come back with the thing. Yeah, yeah, I like that idea. Yeah, there are probably some people who have had that experience, Matthew.
OK, maybe.
No, go on, go on.
No, no, I was just thinking, like, if that happened to you and you were like, you thought this game was a minute long, I'd really like, I'd worry for that person.
That's true. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's like that's a 30 quid for that would be lean.
Right. My number 10. Really wrestle with this.
There's two games, actually three games that have been vying for this spot because I feel like there's a canon list of like back page classics that must be in this top 10. And then like one or two heart picks. I just knew I had to have in the list as well.
So this 10 position. Sorry, Firewatch and Tom Clancy's The Division, but I'm giving it to Superhot. So of all the games, of all the kind of indie games from this year, like I think that Superhot is my favorite because it was something that I felt was missing from games a little bit.
It's kind of like a sort of best described as like a puzzle shooter, I suppose, where essentially you are, it has this very stark kind of like red characters on a white background visual style. And anytime you move in the game, time moves forward. So you find yourself basically dropped into the middle of like movie set pieces.
You're just being shot at next to an elevator. And it's like, okay, you look around and you can dodge the bullets. You can very carefully grab a gun in midair while like an enemy has thrown it, or sort of like punch an enemy, shoot an enemy, that sort of thing.
But once you've shot the bullet, you then have to move in order to see the bullet, follow its trajectory. So it's really like about the set pieces playing out and you controlling the sequence of events in a way that makes you feel like a kind of action superhero, but it's anything but brainless as well. It's all about, you know, coordinating an attack.
So this person who runs to this place will hit this bullet when they kind of get there, basically, and that that sort of thing. So it captures that kind of like matrix-y combat experience maybe better than any other modern game does. And even though the game itself is very lean, about three hours, with a lot of narrative stuff that I just completely skipped over, I think there might be some hidden narrative stuff in there.
I just found this really scratched and itched, something I just really felt like was missing from games, something I really just needed. And I've replayed it a couple of times. I've played the VR one, which is really cool as well.
And yeah, it just felt like, I don't know, this was a hit for a real good reason. It was just, I think it was like a, it might have started as like a game jam demo that became a full game. And then they built a whole team and a company off the back of it.
So really love Superhot. I think it's, I think it stood the test of time. What do you think of that one, Matthew?
One of those games that instantly recognizable as itself in any screenshot. The whole moving time pitch is just so clean. The fun of the scenarios and the interactions of like, you hit this guy and this thing flies out of his hands and you can catch it.
It follows film rules in terms of how you think props and things should work in these scenarios.
I think what I like about it is when you find yourself surrounded by people, you end up doing a thing where you're like, okay, I'll fire these bullets now and then like, I'll return to that situation later to see if they've hit him and see if he's down. And then in the meantime, go and like clobber this guy and throw my empty gun at this other guy. And then like, and then like, your reward for doing, for coordinating all this and making all that, all those pins fall down is you get to watch it play out in sort of real time at the end.
It goes super hot, super hot while playing a replay of everything you just did. And that can make you feel like an absolute fucking superstar, I think. So even if you're even if you're playing badly, it still gives you that that shot of like, oh, wow, I really do feel like an action superhero.
So, yeah, what a game. Really, really love it. Curious to see what our studio ends up making down the line.
There's a really good level in like a lift, which is a bit like the just you and a lot of guys in a lift, which has got big Captain America, Cold War, no, whatever that one is. Yeah. Winter Soldier?
Civil War. Oh, yeah, no, it was Winter Soldier, that one, wasn't it?
The one where he fights all the guys in the lift or Mission Impossible 3.
That's true. That is very much the prototypical sort of like version of that scene, isn't it? Yes.
I remember that one. I think any like of these situations when you're surrounded by dudes, it just works really well because you really do get that feeling of you've been dropped into the middle of the set pieces. It's about to kick off.
That's what it does so well. So, yeah, seeing how the level designers play with that works really nicely.
It's interesting that you mentioned Firewatch there also because that was in my list of maybes. I really like the first half of it where it feels a bit more like everyday life. I actually go off it the more it kind of hints at the mysteries of the world.
I think the tough thing with re-evaluating this genre in retrospect is it's just not a genre that's in vogue right now, is it? It's just like we are not in the walking simulator narrative delivered to you in that form, times, you know? It's just so not what games are currently about that I struggle to get excited about it in retrospect.
It feels like a thing that happened and then I just sort of moved on from it. It certainly had the most distinctive setting. And I don't know how tuned in I was to the dynamic between the two characters.
I like that about it, but I think that maybe, yeah, it's the sort of lonely guy in this tower and then trying to actually like patrol this place and figure out what the deal was and see, you know, see what was going on. Maybe I slightly preferred that, too. I don't know.
But it was certainly strong. It was certainly singular, you know. It was a huge deal when it came out, wasn't it?
Everyone was just excited that they got to write about a game with the guy from Mad Men in it.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I did wrestle with that. I wrestled with The Division because I played, I had to play a ton of it to play it right about The Division 2 and I did actually end up having a really good time with it.
It's quite a quite a deep and cool game and that New York setting does like definitely stays with you the way they brought it to life. But yeah, let's face it, Superhot adds a bit more spice to the list. So yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
What's the number nine, Matthew?
Talking of spice, Kirby Planet Robobot.
Nice.
This continues the fine work of Kirby Triple Deluxe, which was the big 3DS Kirby game. Only this one puts Kirby in a huge mech suit, which is obviously going to be a good thing. Cute Kirby in anything Stranger Mechanical is like instant win.
It's just a really confident, solid feeling 2D platformer. Use the 3DS in lots of fun ways with like things coming in and out of the foreground and background and these big bosses that take up lots of space famously ends with a proper platinum level insane space set set piece, which is always a good thing. I just think this era of Kirby is, I think it's just a period where they really sort of solidified the magic of 2D Kirby, the kind of experimenting with disabilities, but also just with the extra technical kind of polish that they had on these 3DS versions.
I feel bad I've included this and maybe not another met game.
Oh, I think I have a feeling what that game might be Matthew. Yeah, but this is a very you pick and so far I'm actually I did I wonder before we did this episode, how's Matthew going to like bend the list to his like sort of Nintendo, you know, for one of a better phrase, bullshit, you know, when I mean that in a good way, I mean, I just thought how is he going to like Nintendo up this list in a year that seems so non Nintendo, but actually it passed me by this came out and I remember this being very high. Was this number one on your list of Kirby games?
It's one of those lists where things sort of shift around constantly. But yeah, it's up high. I just I think both the 3DS ones are great.
This one has like more of an angle because the, you know, it isn't just this mech power up, but like the mech power up has kind of ability versions as well like Kirby. So changes changes it up. And even when he's out of the mech, you still have Kirby gets all his abilities and becomes always different characters.
It just it just feels like there's a lot more in this one and the kind of the fighting other giant robots gives this game just a little a little bit more kind of coherence. If Triple Deluxe is a vague fantasy world, this one's maybe kind of easy to buy into. They're both they're both pretty great.
But yeah, planet Robo Bot. I just like the word Robo Bot of like the idea of combining robot with robot I think is pretty audacious.
This this seemed like this seems like if you played Kirby the Forgotten Land, this is probably the one to go and get after that Matthew because it's the more more recent kind of inventive Kirby game.
Obviously the 2D, 3D things different, but like the attitude and what they value in terms of like unlockable modes and their surprising value for money in terms of how much shit is crammed into the games. And also this kind of like how they escalate in the kind of mad places they go to. Yeah, there's a lot of kind of connective tissue there.
Yeah, I also I've like this is one of those 3DS games I've been weighing up buying and like it has been it was pricey for quite a while. But now I think Amazon actually has new copies of it, so maybe we should just grab it before like all those copies have just gone forever.
Yeah, RoboBot.
Yeah, RoboBot. That is ridiculous. Is that meant to be like a RoboCop kind of riff or something like that?
Like the name, I don't or is that just meant to be, like you say, the audacity of combining the word robot twice to make a new word?
No, I thought I would like to think it's the latter. I mean, there is like an Iwata asks where they're like, we're all big RoboCop heads here at how I mean, RoboCop has got like a very different energy to Kirby.
Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, okay. Good stuff.
All right. That's a good pick. Again, I thought this was like a complete dud year for the 3DS, but you have proven me wrong.
I mean, we are pretty much out of the Nintendo games now.
Right. Okay, that's it. It's done.
That's it now. Okay, fair. Okay.
My number nine is a game that Matthew does not like. It is The Last Guardian on PlayStation 4. So in E3 2009, they revealed this game coming to PS3.
It was about a boy and a little boy summoning this dog-like bird creature, like a dog with wings essentially. And it was from Fumito Ueda, who was obviously the director of Shadow of the Colossus and Ico, two era-defining PlayStation 2 games, so this was hotly anticipated. And then for whatever reason, the game just fades from view and never comes out on PlayStation 3, which kind of symbolic of that generation's woes for Sony, I think, just can't make good things happen.
They're just, all good things must die and we must have brown shooters, basically. But years later at E3 2015, it's revived. It feels almost like the success of the PlayStation 4 played some part in the incentive to get this done to me.
This is something we can do for PlayStation players that will absolutely fucking love, even though I think that Ueda was always still connected to this game in some way. And then, so yeah, it comes back in 2016, they finally released it right at the end of the year. It's very different, I think, to Ico and Shadow of the Colossus.
What it has in common, I think, is a slight fiddliness in controls. But what it also has in common is the idea of creating a world and type of story and method of delivering the story that's not really like what you get in other games. So the magic of this game is how amazingly the beast, Trico in the game, and the little boy are, basically.
They interact like they feel real. And even though you are kind of ordering the monster around, he feels like a real enough creature that he will sometimes disobey your orders or do something slightly different. It's like trying to get a dog to do something in real life, and the dog sometimes just stands nonplussed by something, not really knowing what it's supposed to be doing.
There's a bit of that with this, where he's like a half-reliable companion, extremely powerful. You need his power in order to basically deal with enemies and to physically move between bits of the world. Essentially, the entire game is about climbing out of one hole, where Trico was chained up and where you were, and trying to get to the very top of this space.
You look up and you look down and you can basically see where you're going and where you've been for the entire game. It's quite an amazing effect they create, I think. I really loved it and I think that it technically struggled a bit on PS4, which I think shed some light on why it maybe didn't come to PS3, because it seemed impossibly demanding for that, just because of how detailed the creatures' animations were, were out of control.
It leads to this finale that is definitely the best bit of the game. I guess, some mild spoilers here, but let's say Trico or Trico, how have you pronounced that? That creature is not the only one of its kind, and there are other creatures of that species that you encounter late in that game.
And that finale is so extraordinarily rendered, and it's such a different change in pace from what you've been experiencing up until that point, that I think it just really leaves an impact. There's also this very sort of mournful, the little boy telling the story as an old man in retrospect, framing to the story, which I think lends it this sort of, like, Ghibli-esque kind of melancholy. This was a creature I encountered once.
We had this really powerful bond, and then we didn't see each other again kind of thing.
That's like us on this podcast looking back on my knee story at Gamescom. You're like, I met this weird creature with a bleeding knee, and we had an intense bond for three days in Cologne.
So I really like The Last Guardian. I acknowledge its flaws. It does, like I say, it feels like it's got some PS2 era control quirks to it.
But of all the stuff that Sony made in this generation, this is the thing where I was like, well, sensible heads have prevailed that they've got this done. Like it was a long wait and it was just about worth it. Thoughts, Matthew?
Where I'm down on this is just a very basic, basic bitched take on like, I find the control is a bit fiddly and the thing a bit unreliable. That is the point, like you say, it's a strength to many. But it just wasn't my cup of tea.
I always feel bad about this one because like the people who love it, you know, they love it in such a like profound way, or they just really, really connected with that creature. I just didn't have that. But I fully understand where that connection can come from and why that would be profound.
I wish I did like it in the way that, you know, I've read from people who are into this game. So I don't think it's a bad game. It just didn't quite work for me.
I think it's cool that we can have games which tread that kind of risky ground. They're going to be your favourite thing or not for you at all.
Yeah, I think I think as well that one thing I will say is I don't think it has the stickiness of Shadow of the Colossus or Ico, which are games I've replayed over the years, you know. So I've never replayed this. I don't think I necessarily feel like I need to.
I think there's there's one difference I think maybe exists between this and those games is that it doesn't have the same texture of like the world being mysterious and strange and you not understanding it, but wanting to know more about it, which I actually think that Ico and Shadow of the Colossus is a combo did incredibly well where you were like, OK, you can sort of you can see the castle from Ico in Shadow of the Colossus. So then the ending of the story connects back to Ico. And then there's also the kind of there was also the weird real life mythology of everyone knowing that they were like some creatures they cut from Shadow of the Colossus and people determined to go out and find the secrets and things like that.
And I think that you could just live in that world and soak things up in a way that you couldn't with this game. I think you just saw the end of the story of this game, and that was kind of the end of your relationship with it. So that's why I've got it a little bit lower, I think, than maybe.
I don't know, maybe some people are expecting, based on how I've talked about each other classes in the past. So, yeah, that kind of makes sense, Matthew. Okay, we come to your number eight, Matthew.
What have you got?
Final Fantasy XV.
Yeah, okay, so that's slightly higher on my list, so we'll come back to that one very shortly. So my number eight is Titanfall 2. Not on your list, right?
Isn't on my list. I've only got, like I say, space in my heart for one mech, and it's driven by a pink blob.
That's completely fair. So yeah, Titanfall 2. So the original Titanfall came along was, seemed like it was a relatively big seller, but obviously was tied to Xbox One, and Xbox One didn't become like a huge deal.
So it felt like it never took off in the way that Destiny did on PS4, for example, which was tied to that console and its success in lots of ways. It was a shooter where you could summon in a mech, get in the mech, and there was this symbiosis between you and that mech and how you played the game. And it was a really exciting, sort of pulse-pounding first-person shooter experience.
In Titanfall 2, they decided to do a story this time, they didn't in the first one, and I think that was a very fair criticism of the first game, is it just didn't have that thing to get you into the game, to teach you the mechanics and to get you excited about it. But in some ways, I think it was a good thing for how this campaign ends up being as good as it is. So the real magic of Titanfall 2 is it's quite an unusual first-person shooter campaign.
It doesn't feel like it's trying to wow you with an amazing story. The story of it is basically you and your robot companion in the game, your mech companion. I think it's like BT, I think is the name of the robot.
That relationship sort of like slowly builds over the course of the game. And you have this very nice connection between the main character and it. But the shooter levels you're playing through basically are quite inventive.
There's a mix of like using Titanfall's athleticism. So like your platforming skills to get to get through levels. So there are some levels that feel more platforming based.
There are some levels where it's very much about like a high concept. So we just talked about this in the Excel, but they had the obviously that the prefab house manufacturing location, which was the factory, which was an amazing setting because it allowed you to use your skills in different ways because those prefab houses would be tilted in different directions. So sometimes you're wall running.
Sometimes you're just fighting enemies inside these like, you know, basically like fake houses, which was really cool. And then it would just do some amazing things, I think, with what you could do with like first person shooter levels. And then it was just kind of gone in about five or six hours.
Very, very brief, but short and sharp and just full of ideas. So that combined with the fact that the multiplayer was even better, just like, you know, sort of building on the first game and that experience, which I actually did get to sample a bit more of when they re-released Titanfall 2 on, we put it on Steam a couple of years ago, is that just how amazing it looks and sounds and feels. Just the sound of gunfire and then like mechs dropping into the battle.
It's just so dramatic and exciting and it looks incredible. And there's just always so much going on. It always feels so like busy and exciting.
And it feels like you can always get cool things done as a player. You can always, if you don't have a mech, you can go and ruin someone's good time. There's just always something good for you to be doing combined with this amazing movement and the wall running and that sort of stuff.
And then the mech is like the cherry on top, basically. So that combination was just really strong. Obviously, it deserved to have more of a multiplayer tale than it did.
It lives on a PC a little bit, but it otherwise didn't quite happen, which is a bit of a shame, but really cool for what it was. And that campaign was massively hyped, but it really did live up to the hype. But I think it also, I think like there was maybe, it felt like a slight push back on where first person shooter campaigns had gone at this time, too.
They just wasn't, it died out as a concern. And then this year feels like the year where it comes back a little bit more. And this is showing people, no, you don't have to fight humans for a first person shooter to be exciting.
Just because Call of Duty campaigns have gotten more and more stale, it doesn't mean that that's the only way you can do it. And this is like, yeah, I think this is part of that movement. And now I think we're first person shooters that have a single player component are actually bigger than they were six or seven years ago at this time.
So that's cool. So yeah, an important game, I think, Matthew, in a lot of ways. And the ultimate, someone picks it up on EA Game Pass or whatever and then plays it.
And then they're like, oh, I didn't realize this game was this good. So yeah, yeah, trifle too. Any thoughts?
My little confession is that I feel I'm too cowardly to be the mech in the fights. I feel like it's all eyes on the mech. I feel like there's too much pressure to be good when you've got the mech.
I'm much more at ease when I'm a person in the fights. That's my big time take.
Yeah, I kind of get it. I think you do feel a bit of pressure, I think, for sure when it turns up. I think you're like, oh, well, now I have to really perform.
And then if you fuck it up and you're just on fire and exploding, like straight away.
It just turns up and everyone's like, oh, there's someone who doesn't know how to be a mech. You know, you've spent all these years learning to be a human to actually be a mech is a very different thing. But you are right.
It's kind of amazing that they managed to make this work at all, to have something which is behave so differently and is so much more powerful, just so much physically bigger in those matches and for it to still make sense. And it's so inherently cinematic. It feels like something you'd have to like script and have very firm control over for it to work, but that it can happen in the arena, I think is is is amazing.
I just wish I was a little a little more comfortable having people rain rockets down on me. I almost won't bring in the mech just to preempt the embarrassment of losing 10 seconds later. I won't give you the pleasure of destroying my powerful mech.
I see what you mean. I can't really work out why it didn't become big other than maybe like it was just a hard era to make a new first person shooter happen, multiplayer shooter happen. I don't know, but I guess Overwatch happened at the same time, right?
So maybe that just squashed this game. And maybe its art style was more appealing to people than the sort of like more, you know, hard sci-fi mech stuff here. I mean, obviously, like they would borrow back from Overwatch 2 and how they made Apex Legends and designed those characters.
And yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, just the idea of EA putting this out and Battlefield 1. You're lucky if you can make one of these games work. The idea of having two competing things in the same space just does seem very dumb to me.
Yeah, I don't know why they did that. I think everyone at the time was pointing that out as well. It's like just putting six months apart.
What would happen if they released Titanfall 2 in the early part of the next year? It might have been a different deal. So, I don't know.
A weird one. But yeah, certainly to me, it feels like the standout. Well, one of the standout shooters of this year.
But certainly one. Yeah, it gelled with me more than Battlefield 1 did for sure. What's your number seven, Matthew?
My number seven is The Witness.
Nice, not on my list.
Obviously, Jonathan Blow's open world puzzle game where you walk around an island interacting with electronic panels, each of which is controlled by you sort of steer a line through a 2D grid to complete a pattern. And the game is about working out the rules of the grids and like what each grid is asking you. And there are different bits of the island and different clusters of puzzles that kind of group around certain rules.
Sometimes it's very obvious like the evolution of one panel to the next. You know, you're seeing the kind of puzzle growing complexity in a very clear way. Sometimes they're a lot more abstract and you're trying to extract the rules from like the world around you, or it's indicating something to you in a very clever way.
And I guess it's just about, well, I'm not even going to take upon that what it's about. I will say there's a lot of wanky stuff that I don't like about The Witness, by which I mean stuff I don't understand. And we always feel what you don't understand, so I call it wanky.
It probably is very profound. But I love that process of naturally gleaning what's being asked of you in each puzzle mechanic. I think that's really, really smart.
And, you know, very famously with this game, there is a layer to it kind of beyond that that obvious puzzle interaction, which when you tap into it, you realize there's sort of two games happening at once. And that second game and the way it uses the world and makes you think about the world is more satisfying to me than the basic panel stuff. And yeah, this is just a really beautiful place.
I spent loads of time just noodling away and chipping away and working little things out. Makes you feel really clever when you have these breakthroughs. Like I said, there's something else to it that I don't really understand.
Like there's bits where you watch like a weird documentary or you hear like some strange essay being read out. And that was a little bit too much for me. I could appreciate enough of the cleverness to enjoy this game.
Yeah, I sort of I had a go at this and I felt like I was like one of the dumbass apes at the start of 2001 of Space Odyssey. Like the ones who are like not on the evolutionary, who are like done for basically, evolutionary speaking. I was like impressed by like the scope with which it was realized.
Like you look at this vast kind of like, you know, island landmass location and think, OK, there's loads of moving parts here. So it's obviously there is like a meta element to this, but they just seem to be solving a load of old mazes and people just losing their minds going home and shit.
Yeah, I mean, that's also true.
Yeah, I mean, like that's the thing. But again, I know that that's too reductive. I only played for like an hour and I just I was completely.
I was like, no, I just don't really fancy solving mazes for like 10 hours or whatever. So but, you know, a lot of clever clogs in the office. Matthew seemed to be like, whoa, this game.
So I probably just missed it, you know.
That's the slightly annoying thing about being a fan of this game is it feels like you're trying to make a statement about yourself by liking it. And I'm trying to reinforce that that isn't like there's loads of stuff in this. I was like, I don't get that.
I hate that. You know, that was my relationship with that. But I feel like there was enough like instantly rewarding, tangible stuff, like quite spectacular puzzle solving.
Like the hidden layer of this is when you see what he's up to on this island and how he's hiding other stuff there, it's quite audacious to hide these big things in plain sight. You start solving extra embedded puzzles and solutions to them. They're visually so big on screen that you feel like, how does everyone not see this?
I like the wizardry of that, the kind of rubbing it in your face element of it, I think is actually quite playful.
Okay, yeah, interesting. I just read about what kind of a lot of it's building up to, which is a completely reductive way to appreciate this game.
Right.
But I can see why that would leave a bit of an impact. So yeah, I think a lot of this is, well, it's like sometimes if I could not read the tweets of the person who made something, I would probably just like go into it without any preconceptions, you know what I mean? There's a bit of that sometimes.
I think that goes along with like modern art, but yeah.
Yeah, I don't buy into it being like, this is the way things should be, or this guy understands these things in a way no one else does. That was a hurdle. I had to get over to enjoy it, but I did.
Fair enough. Yeah, fair enough. I wouldn't rule out going back to it one day.
I bet like it's a good Steam Deck game, for example, that would seem like a spot on place for that simple but pretty art style, like you say. Okay, interesting. So we come to my number seven, which is your number eight.
This is very different to The Witness.
Yeah, so Final Fantasy XV. Matthew, why don't you talk about why you like this? Because I feel like I've talked about it a lot on the on pods we've done.
I think we like it for quite similar reasons. I think this game's kind of like a big mess, and part of that's tied to like knowing what a mess the development was, and I think a lot of that's quite obvious. Very much a game of two halves, this open world adventure where you're driving around with with your mates in this car, and then this strange rush to the finish line where it becomes super linear in a way which just feels like a team had to get a game finished rather than it's necessarily what they wanted to do.
But I think it's one of those classic seven out of tens where, while the whole is a bit all over the place, I think there's a lot of humanity and charm in this group of four. I really like spending time with these these these guys as we're potting around doing so-so combat with an absolutely killer battle theme which makes you think you're having a better time than you probably are. But also the madness of like how detailed certain things are or where the time went in this game, the fact that they've modeled all these intricate dishes that one member of your party cooks for you whenever you camp, I think is really delightful, like the actual kind of world design of all the different towns and locations you go to, you know, very beautiful places even though there's often not much to do there.
Really it's no more complicated than AAA game making where I think you can sense a lot of like bad decisions in it but you can also sense like a lot of love and care and attention has gone into it. I think you can really sense the team behind it and their intent in that and that really resonates with me. I just think it's a good story about guys going on adventures together and male friendship and having a good time with the lads.
Yeah, I thought it was a bit of a tonic at the end of the year to be honest because it was like, I don't know, I think that what I just found this as a tonal contrast to other games just spot on. It was sort of like in when I heard the battle music I was like this feels like Final Fantasy, I'm comforted by this, but also it starts with the four boys and their broken car, right? And that's like, it sets the tone of, you know, that's what this game is really about.
It's not really about what the wider threat is, which you won't understand anyway, because there's not enough cutscenes or context that's actually going on. So all you really have to get invested in is like, what's going on with these lads? Because the wider story doesn't actually make sense to you.
But that's okay, because that is very easy to track. And the way that story is told through, you know, like how the photos that are taken by, you know, it's prompt to take the characters' photos. Yeah.
And then like the way that the different characters remark on how they look in them or experiences they had or that sort of thing. That's how the story is really delivered more than cutscenes and things like that. And it's just so inventive and characterful and just gives all these characters their moment.
And it just really makes you buy into that friendship. So I think even when this game gets really baffling in its second half and you are the moment that you are dragged along with this wider story that you're not really tuned into. Because like when you get to the very end of the game where there is spoiler alert, a time jump, and you just and it is really about like these four guys returning to where they started years later.
And it just it just that part lands even if the rest of it is completely confusing. So yeah, like you say, a real muddled old game. But, you know, I just that first open world is like still one of my favorite open worlds, though.
It's just the weird way the landmass looked like the bits of like strange outcropping of rocks and crystals and things like that. There was a really distinctive like silhouette to the landscape, you know what I mean?
It's quite a tough open world to like navigate. Like there's lots of like irritating fences and blockages where I think a team with a bit more experience wouldn't put those in. Like I definitely found the more open bits of Final Fantasy XVI a little easier to like navigate.
Because I think Final Fantasy XV is like quite an irritating game to play still, which kind of undermines some of some of that freedom. But I don't know, I think probably if you add it all up, I maybe prefer it to XVI.
Yeah, I can sort of see why.
Like it seems it's literally the opposite, you know, XVI is the game which makes total sense and that's its strength. But it's also doesn't feel like there's much to it. Where here, like there is quite a lot of elements to it.
I think it feels more like an RPG. They're just more systems and distractions for you. And I just wish it made sense because it is it is a bummer when you get into that.
It's maybe like the last third and you're just like, yeah, what's happening? Who are these guys? Like people turn up for, you know, they look cool.
The art design is always amazing for fantasies. But these sort of boss characters turn up and you have no idea who they are. Where like every one of those encounters in 16 is really clearly kind of led up to and sold.
It's a weird one because I think 16 traps you into doing the side content it does have, which is one of its weaknesses. It's like, well, Yoshi, you have to do these side quests and it's not fun. Whereas I don't think 15 actually traps you into really doing anything.
There's a lot of stuff you can go out and find. But I think a lot of what the open world gives you is actually content you can discover optionally once you've completed the main story and you have the option to kind of time travel back using your dog to an earlier point in time, which is basically giving you access to the open world again. Again, very confusing story there.
But I think you have 16's pace, so you are meant to do side content as part of the main game, really. And 15, just not all of it is made equal by any means. And some of it is just fetch quest kind of nonsense.
But there are also cool hunts out there. There are also these kind of like weird dungeons that like, there are red lights on the dungeons at night, which makes them seem quite spooky and kind of horror-y, which is really cool. And those dungeons, like, you know, how the combat is pretty shallow.
But, you know, to explore spaces and to find out what's in there is still a cool element of this game, I think. And yeah, I think it's got like a lot to like about it. I think some people just wrote it off because they were like, it doesn't feel like old Final Fantasy, but it doesn't actually, it's not a best in class action game either.
But I don't know, I think some of its parts actually like, you know, it's actually like, I think it's got a lot to offer. And I reflect on it fondly. It's probably a heart pick more than anything else on my list.
Yeah, for sure.
Yeah. But I don't know, it was cool. It was just, it was exactly what I wanted it to be and what I needed to be.
Just the second half is like jumble of events. Like you're looking at like a big, weird sort of like frozen Shiva head at nighttime. And it's quite spooky and strange.
Then there's, Ignis gets blinded for some reason at some point. Then one of them falls off a train. And like, it's just, it's just an absolute garble of random stuff.
Then there's like a massive battle with Leviathan in that, in that city that looks like Venice. Just, it just feels like lots of like moments that they just couldn't string together.
There's a wedding dress designed by fucking Vivienne Westwood or someone.
Yeah, just a weird game, weird omni-game. Just like, just tries to do everything at once, but they didn't have the time to really like execute it to the standard it needed to be. But yeah, like I say, still one of my favorite open worlds just to be in, just to be in and hang out.
It's one of the best hangs of any game really. So yeah, FF15 deserves to be celebrated and there it is, number seven for me, number eight for you. What's your number six, Matthew?
My number six is Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, Spirit of Justice.
Of course.
Soon to be re-released as part of the Apollo Justice trilogy. That's kind of overselling the role of Apollo Justice. It's a bit weird that the second trilogy of Ace Attorney games are meant to be about Apollo Justice, but they kind of lose all faith in him after Apollo Justice and just bring back Phoenix Wright, he's the main character, and Apollo Justice is just there on the side.
It's like ostensibly the story is about a family connection with him, but to claim that he's the main event is preposterous. I don't think this is the best Ace Attorney outside of the Shootakumi games. Best cases, best music, best scenarios.
The court case mechanic in this one is that you've gone to this foreign kingdom of Korain where the sort of spirit channeling comes from that you see in the rest of the games, and in their trials they're dictated by these divination seances where you see the crime through the eyes of the victim in their dying moments, and they use that as evidence. A big part of these cases is you watch these first person reenactments of the deaths. You have to check for what they can hear, see, smell and feel, and try and find contradictions to show how murders have been falsified in some way.
That's alongside the traditional Ace Attorney stuff of calling out contradictions, using the evidence, shouting a lot and asking questions. So it's got all the cool Ace Attorney stuff, but I actually think the gimmick in this one is much more effective than the weird emotional heart scope or whatever it was that they did in Dual Destinies, which actually does return in this. I was a little bit down on the idea of the Phoenix Wright gang going on holiday to a different place, but that really ups the drama.
They go to a place where, hilariously, if the client is found guilty, their lawyer is also put to death, which is absolutely preposterous, but adds some genuine stakes to the game. That's quite a good hook for this kind of preposterous world.
We should do that in Games Court.
Yes. You die, they die. It's hard to pin down exactly what it is about the cases that are better.
I just think that the team had really settled into it. The nature of the mysteries, they're a little bit more twisty-turny than Shutakumi's. Shutakumi's mysteries are a little bit more straightforward, a little bit more Western.
This team, they're a little... They lean a little closer to the kind of like gimmickry of the kind of impossible Japanese crime authors, which is probably why it resonates with me. I also really like the DLC for this, which is a big time travel case where it looks like someone has traveled through time and can that be true?
Is it not? I think kicking that apart is really good fun. Absolute doozy of a final case as well.
Like really, really strong ending.
Yeah, yeah. It sort of feels like there's... It always felt to me like the second trilogy just never quite had the same level of conversation around it as the first trilogy did.
And that might just be because there were a lot of them at once in the West and then the latter two games obviously only came to 3DS as digi downloads. So I felt like it was like an only real heads no with Spirit of Justice element, but maybe that will change with the re-release.
I remember at the time people being a bit sniffy that it was like digital only, but you're like, you know, true fans to shut the fuck up and play it, you know?
And at least they did re-release it. There were games in this series that were not being released here. So it's, you know, at least they got a spin in the West, so that's good for sure.
Sure.
Okay, my number six is Doom 2016. Otherwise, it's known as Doom. So for a long time, there were rumors of a Doom 4, and there was a Doom 4 they tried to make and then gave up and then axed it and then started again.
And I don't know how confident people were in Doom 2016 until they saw it in action in 2015 and realized how much of the sort of like spirit of like, I guess like heavy metal kind of like vibes of Doom they'd captured in the way it like looked and sounded with this real like physical element of like mashing through enemies to get like health and ammo. And almost as Resi 4 like dynamic of, you know, you shoot an enemy until you kind of, they're weakened and then you get the moment to do the finisher, the lovely animation plays out and then like the battle keeps going and you are powered up by doing those finishes. And it was a really cool dynamic they happened across while also tapping into the old iconography of Doom as this sort of like, you know, sci-fi, sort of horror-y but heavy metal album cover, you know, sort of like visual style.
So they really synthesized those things nicely and then merged it with great guns that you could like modify and improve the way that they behaved in the game and like really, just really, really strong level design that wasn't super linear, that was, you know, they were not like mazes in the way that old Doom levels were, but they were certainly like, they were proper spaces you had to actually navigate and figure out and had secrets in them and things like that. And it was a really strong, like I say, like I know there was a multiplayer element to this game. I have no idea what the multiplayer was like.
I have no notion of people really playing it, but that was the thing, that the single player was so good that that was what people talked about. And that was the thing that captured people's imaginations. And it was just, the guns just felt so good.
Like they just had, you could just modify like a rocket launcher to fire loads of little rockets. And you suddenly felt like Iron Man. And it was just really just like a great arsenal, fantastic chunky enemies.
You could just like enjoy ripping apart. And yeah, just so much momentum to the campaign. Doom Eternal would take it even further with how athletic you could be.
And you know, just how exciting the set pieces were. This was just, it felt like single player PS games were back at this point, Matthew. Thoughts?
That thing about like the momentum and after years and years of like shooters becoming, more about like precise military endeavors. You know, it's all about like the single sort of snipe of the head or whatever, to have something which really rewarded and found a way to reward always pushing forwards and like making you play aggressively. Like it's a very successful game at like drawing you into its rhythms, which is like part of the challenge with a lot of these things is like you can build a game, but it's like, can you make someone kind of like really connect with the way it's meant to be played to actually get the most out of it?
But I think here you soon learn that trying to play it a bit more carefully just won't work.
It really was. It was just everything you wanted. It just was fast.
It was like you say, there's no there's no cover, no piddly cover stuff. It was just like, yeah, just get in there constantly be circling enemies constantly using your physical, your physical physically getting out of the way of stuff. But you have to be up close in their face and things like that.
And just being like set pieces being these like vast things you need to dismantle while you keep moving. And then just at the end of it being like, yep, that felt good. And they were just like, you know, there are monster guts everywhere kind of thing.
Yeah, just, yeah, great. Just really, really good. So yeah, I can see why Doom Eternal would overpower a little bit.
It's so I think some people prefer this. I personally just think it's like an it's a new evolution of like the first person shooter that was much needed and both were very successful. And then Doom Eternal just pushed a bit more in the kind of like different ideas that Doom 2016 brought to that flavor and you either liked that more or you didn't, I think.
Yeah, but it went really well. So yeah, great game. Well done everyone involved.
What's your number five, Matthew?
My number five is Uncharted 4.
Higher on my list. My number five, I wonder if this is on your list. Inside, is this on your list?
Higher on my list.
Excellent. So what's your number four?
Number four, Shadow Tactics, Blades of the Shogun.
Not on my list.
This is Mimimi Games. Real time tactics game. I don't think it's their first game, but I think it's the first game of this sort.
This was a team that basically took the kind of style of game that you used to see in Commandos and Desperados. They sort of isometric stealth games where you controlled a squad of people, big view cones, trying to get people to coordinate attacks, playing them very very carefully, often quick saving and quick loading a lot. Maps that you'd spend hours meticulously clearing out.
I just think they did a brilliant job of updating it for like the Modern Appetite. I think visually they're really gorgeous. This one particularly with this feudal Japan is a really beautiful thing to behold.
It has a really great interface which lets you just like have total command of the situation. Like really the art of these games is there's all these enemies but like if you have enough information about like what they can see and what they can hear and how your moves will interact with that and affect that, I think that's where you begin to start plotting out these really intricate schemes to take everyone down and one of the best games out there at conveying the information of a situation making sure you really understand like the rules and behaviors of what everything's going to do and I often think of it more like I often say like they should make a heist game or a Mission Impossible game because for me it taps into the same satisfaction of seeing a well-oiled team doing all this cool stuff in tandem. You have a squad of different ninjas all with very different abilities so like the roles they play in different maps and how you can use them together is really interesting.
You've kind of got like a jack of all trades ninja. You've got a strong man who can kill multiple people at once, carry multiple bodies. You have a kind of distraction trapper who can lure people over to their traps.
You have a person trained in disguises. So there's like a social stealth element. And then you have a sniper who's basically this really old geezer who in a lot of the maps there'll be a very high tower.
And he's, I think he's maybe got like one leg or something. There's some gimmick about him that when he walks like something makes a lot of noise. Maybe it's his wooden leg.
So actually you just tend to kind of stick him up in a tower and he can snipe people. But you can do this thing where you sort of slow down time and program in multiple moves to then trigger so you can set people to kind of attack a squad all at once so that no one character, no enemy sees another enemy gets picked off because they're all killed at the same time. Absolutely brilliant.
I think it's a formula they've only gotten better at. I think Desperado's 3 was better than Shadow Tactics. I think their new one, Shadow Gambit, I haven't been able to play a huge amount of it yet, but it's just so polished, so accomplished.
for this team, it all starts here. They nail most of the formula here, and most of what's going to be really great about their games is aced here. The only thing I'm not wild about is in this game, when you go into that planning mode, time doesn't fully stop, the enemies are still moving a little bit, which is just a little bit too much time pressure and sort of variation for those plans to always work out as you'd hope, where in Desperado's time freezes, it's very kind of clear cut.
That's a very minor minor complaint with a game, which I think is like just one of the best of its kind.
Yeah, that's this felt like the year that these people started taking notice of the studio, Matthew.
Yeah.
And that this game was a bit of a breakout in that respect, like a bit of a slow burn success, I think.
I came to it, I didn't come to it this year, like I remember ignoring this for a long time.
Yeah, I think that it sort of like snowballed as people got in like humble bundles or free on Epic and stuff like that. And yeah, they've gradually accumulated this reputation. So yeah, looking forward to the new one for sure.
I remember Phil Savage making a big deal about this and fighting to get into our like top 100 list and stuff like that.
Yeah, I think actually that's why I played it was it being championed specifically in PC Gamer. So that was probably Phil's enthusiasm for it. It really like does just takes that I'm not going to say like, oh, it fixes that old genre, but it took everything you liked about it and just makes it so much more like accessible and polished and through that, like more difficult.
Like it's it's like a perfect example of taking an older thing and applying like new thinking to it.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It's yeah, this is one of the games of theirs I do own and should play at some point. I feel like I'm probably just going to play the new one now and see how it goes.
Yeah, I don't know. I prefer Cowboys to Ninjas. It's probably part of the Desperados thing for me.
That's completely fair. But yeah, I'm good to have it high on the list. It feels like we've covered a good spread between us here.
We haven't had that much crossover so far, really, which is a bit weird, but I thought we'd have more. Such as it is. So my number four, Matthew?
Yeah.
It's Deus Ex Mankind Divided.
It's not in my top ten.
Right. Exactly. So long time coming, this game.
I think it was meant to come out in 2015. It was a five year wait between this and the last one, Human Revolution. Human Revolution came out and I think captured enough of what the original Deus Ex did so well that people were really pumped about immersive sims again.
It was like a success. I don't think it was like a blockbuster, but I think it was like a two or three million level success, so enough of them to justify keep investing in it. It was a really confident and complete version of the type of game they set out to make.
You could play it in an action way, you could play it stealthily and it would respect your choices and it was much easier to grasp, I think, how it worked systems-wise than Dishonored was, for example, in 2012, which I think is a more complicated stealth game that requires more skill. Deus Ex is a little bit more binary. You could figure it out, I just think you could work out the solution a lot easier.
Mankind Divided comes along, weird game. It just sort of ends. It doesn't really have a proper final act and the rumour was they were making two of these at once and then the other one they were going to make they stopped making because this one didn't sell well enough and the only conclusion to that is they shouldn't have greenlit two of them at once if they did that.
They should have just made this one game.
Right.
You know, and then a terrible idea if they did that and then they weren't going to be sure if they'd even finish it. What a load of work wasted. But regardless of what happened there, this game is still really good on its own terms.
So it's still set in a kind of near future setting but what's changed is that Adam Jensen, the main character in the game, you have these kind of augmentations because Adam was hideously injured at the start of Human Revolution. And in this time in the Deus Ex timeline, basically people with augmentations are being persecuted by people who don't have them. And there's a kind of like a slightly, I guess, a path ID element to that story that I think a lot of people considered quite heavy-handed when it came out.
But I actually think the way it's investigated in the game and the way it's depicted in the game in subtle ways is quite nicely done. It's not like you're going down the street and people are shouting, Oi, orgy, get in the back of the bus kind of thing. It's not like that.
It's a bit more like this stuff has already happened and when you get on the train and you have like looks from like, you know, like a woman and her child on the train, it's just sort of implied by what's going on around you. People are sort of like fetishized for it at the same time. I think it's like quite nicely handled.
But there is also the kind of like this slightly dour Prague you get to explore, which I think really works as a space and some of the side quests they use to bring that to life work incredibly well. So there's like a sort of like deadly drug. You're investigating who's kind of like pushing that.
And it's kind of like a mystery for you to solve what what's happened there. You learn more about Adam Jensen's past by catching up with David Sarif, who's a character from the first game. That's one of the side quests.
There's like someone has been killed and trying to figure out from the body, like who the murderer was and unpicking that. And also just these like these weird adverts that you see in the in the world that have these glitches. And you unpick that as a side quest too.
And I actually think that accumulatively all of the side quests make it feel like quite a complete game. You got about like 40 plus hours of stuff to enjoy in there and to to to uncover. And it makes you feel like if they'd had like a cyberpunk level budget, they actually could have made a 10 out of 10 game.
I think they had they had it in them. But, you know, it just it has some limitations, but it holds up nicely. And it's I think a lot of people are praising this in the wake of cyberpunk, because some people feel like that game didn't give you enough choice and or enough outcomes or enough ways to approach the game.
I probably slightly prefer it to cyberpunk, even though there's like a a spectacle element to cyberpunk that this game does not quite have. But yeah, cool game, Matthew. Did you ever play this one?
I think it's mechanically a much nicer game to play in cyberpunk, a much better stealth experience. One of the reasons I'm a bit down in cyberpunk is having played these Deus Ex games, you're constantly thinking back to these and how well they did it. And the tension of trying to play stealthily and how your powers enable that is way more satisfying.
It's just sort of sad what happened with this series and maybe this style of game in general. But we're lucky we got two really good versions of this.
Absolutely. So yeah, and maybe overshadowed by another very similar type of game from this year. What's your number three, Matthew?
My number three is Inside.
Okay, let's do it. Inside. Have we ever talked about this game on the podcast?
I don't know.
Yeah, okay.
Obviously Playdead make these incredible 2D sort of cinematic platform puzzlers. They feel like the sort of descendants of like another world in a way. Very artistic worlds, very all done without dialogue, all done through sort of like, you know, animation and art design.
All the stories kind of implied. You have to interpret it. But it's also got this very sort of wicked streak of black humour in that your characters can die very easily.
In this one, you play a little boy who is making his way through a landscape, seemingly trying to escape some captors. It's never like properly explained what's going on with him. And he encounters strange locations, enemies and technologies on the way.
If it has anything approaching a central mechanic, it's maybe like mind control. Or that's the element which jumps out to me is that there are set pieces in this where you can control these sort of clone figures to solve puzzles where it requires lots of bodies. So there is something about sort of science and manipulation and becoming other things and experiments gone wrong, which is kind of a through line.
That's no better seen than in the sort of astonishing ending to this game where something happens. I won't spoil it for people who haven't played it, the few people who haven't played this, but it introduces a thing which is just one of the most amazingly animated things I've ever seen where, you know, it looks kind of like pre-rendered and predefined, but actually it's very organic and the freedom of control you have shows that it's all happening for real. So it's, you know, really an astonishing game to look at, you know, to see it unfold.
But, you know, at its heart, it is just a, you know, a sort of simple puzzle platformer where you are constantly running into these fatal accidents. It then restarts you back like 10 seconds or so and you take another go. Like it's, it's kind of the sort of learning through doing, I guess, and sort of throwing yourself at a problem.
But the kind of creativity of those solutions and the glee they take in you failing, I think just really speaks to me. But this particular iteration of it jumps out just, I think, really ending is one of the most spectacular things I've seen in a game. It really sticks with me.
And whenever you go back to it, it's like every bit as impressive as you remember, which is really cool. What was your experience with this one?
There is a wild streak of perfectionism in this game. I think, like you say, the animation, like you say, really speaks to that. Just like everything feels handcrafted and right.
And that's underlined even more by having played a few games since this was released that do use similar storytelling techniques, but don't nail it quite as well. And I think this is just this is just perfect. Like you are, you know, a boy, you are on the run, you don't know why, and then things just escalate and escalate.
And it's all told through like wordless, you know, story instances. And you fight you running between these like situations where what you have to do completely changes. You might have to like stand in a, you know, in a line perfectly and keep moving, you know, sort of like without without, you know, sort of like bumping into anyone and just, you know, being unseen, you know, you might be running away from dogs, you might be, you know, sort of like under threat from some underwater monster of some kind.
Like it just you're sort of stumbling between, yeah, these dangerous situations. And it's just it's just blowing your mind as a player how amazingly rendered these these, you know, these scenarios are. And just like how wild and weird the story ultimately ends up being and how it plays out in front of you.
And I think that that sort of shock it gives you is what just made me think at the time like, wow, what an amazing work this is. This is like this is singular. And you just can't you can't replicate its success.
It's like everything they sort of like wanted to do in limbo just pushed so much further forward. Yeah, wild and extraordinary, just fucking so. Yeah, like one of the most like some of the best world building you've ever experienced in a game.
And it's happening in a way that you just don't really see. You don't see presentationally games doing this. There's nothing else like around doing this at the time.
Just what you can do with a 2D, you know, 2D plane, essentially, in the way that 3D graphics intersect with that. Just yeah, perfect. It's a perfect form of a specific type of video game storytelling, you know.
And that's what it left me with.
You're absolutely right as well about when other people have done this, it can go like very wrong. I don't know. Did you play Somerville?
I thought it looked and sounded incredible, but wasn't quite as good.
Just felt like it hadn't had that extra like 2 years of constant iteration that this had. This doesn't have rough edges.
Yeah.
Like this is just, you know, play tested and play tested and play tested. It's that everything behaves exactly as it should. There's no, you know, that's Somerville.
You can just get very lost, very confused easily. Things kind of fuck up or there are like weird bugs or like animation things where it doesn't quite work out. It's like almost there, but like that final 5% probably takes years and years to kind of get over.
Yeah, what you cut and what you keep. I think Somerville would, with a couple more years, would have been shorter. And yeah, and maybe like the mechanics would have been slightly more polished and it would have got to that same level.
But yeah, because obviously it shares one of the same creators, doesn't it? So yeah, yeah, this is something about this. It just, well, yeah, just absolutely took my breath away.
It's like proper like thump in the stomach of a game. Yeah, real, real good. So yeah, what was that in your list?
Your number three, Matthew?
That's my number three.
Yeah, I did consider having it higher. It was, yeah, it really did catch fire despite the fact it was just on Xbox and PC, right? It wasn't on PlayStation for quite a while, I think.
Yeah, I mean, they showed it on Xbox like years before it eventually came out. And so there was a lot of anticipation for like this crazy thing. Obviously Inside had, obviously Limbo like had such cred that, you know, there was this like natural faith in it.
But I remember playing this first on the team and then being, you know, you just come in and say, like, whatever you do, like, you just have to play this thing and get to the end of it. Like, this is just something like unreal happens and it will not disappoint you.
It now feels like there's been a few years since the games come along like that, where it's been like, you have to see what X is.
Yeah, what was the last time that?
Yeah, I don't know. But it feels like maybe it happened with indie games around this time slightly more than it happens than it does now. But yeah, just like, I don't know, just because you would never predict this ending.
But you can have a hundred years to figure out what have a guess at what the ending is. And no one would no one would figure out knowing the premise of the game. No one would figure it out at all.
It's just so much wilder and weirder and how it's brought to life is just like, what the fuck is that? Yeah, incredible. All right.
So my number three, Matthew, we've got Hitman 2016 here. Is this a new list?
Higher.
Interesting. Okay, cool. So we come to your number two.
My number two, Dishonored 2.
Higher on my list.
Oh, what a mess. Wow.
Interesting. You hit Hitman above Dishonored 2. Interesting.
That's exciting. So we come to my number two, right?
Yes.
Okay. So we only have three games left to discuss then. That happened very quickly, didn't it?
Okay. My number two is Uncharted 4.
That was number five.
Right. This comes along. And I'm not really tuned into PlayStation at the time.
I know that this will be a big deal to me. I did feel like Uncharted had sort of run its course with 1, 2 and 3. I was like, well, 3 had some nice ideas that 2 didn't have.
And some other bits.
You've killed Helen Mirren. You've had your fun.
Well, it did feel like there was nothing left to say about Drake. And they'd like resolve the, you know, his whole, you kind of knew what his origin was and you knew where, or did you? Oh, yeah, exactly.
And you kind of knew, it wrapped up his relationship with Sully, seemingly. And then Uncharted 4 suggests there's much more of that story to be told. And I sort of like actually left it 3 months before I played it.
I was like, I was sort of, I knew it was a big deal coming to PlayStation. I was a bit down on the fact that there was an Amy Hennig version of this that got scrapped where they had the actor Todd Stashwick playing Nathan Drake's brother rather than Troy Baker as they did in the finished game. And the villain was going to be played by Alan Tudyk from Firefly.
I don't know who was going to play. I don't know who did eventually play the villain. Actually, I'm not sure who that actor is.
But so there's a version that was like scorched. We never saw it. And then there was a new version helmed by Neil Druckmann that came along.
So it was a little bit like, well, you know, I kind of felt in my head that Amy Hennig had earned the right to continue telling the story of her character. So I had a slight chip on my shoulder about that. When I played it, I was completely amazed by the generational leap in what Naughty Dog was achieving in terms of how it looked and sounded.
But also that it seemed like they had finally gotten good at gameplay. That's not fair. They became like best in class at third person shooting and all of the different aspects of Uncharted in a way that I don't think the first three Uncharted games ever quite were.
Yeah, I think that's fair.
Yeah, yeah. At the same time, the story telling in the game was just so sharp. I think, however you feel about the background they establish of Drake having a brother and then encountering that brother again and the kind of adventure they get into, the way it kind of draws out the one more adventure is maybe an adventure too far element in this game is so much better than what the Indiana Jones movies are able to achieve with the same thing.
That question of what will it cost you to take my one more adventure? Are you sure you can survive it? The way this game asks that question, I think works incredibly well.
And then just adds up to a series best, you know, like array of set pieces and environments that you actually get to explore this time. I think like actually it took me playing this Matthew with my ex and just being like seeing her play one, two and three and then seeing her play four and being like, oh, you actually really noticed the quality leap between, you know, one, two and three. And then when you get to four, like it's just the it's the it's the modern platonic idea of what an uncharted game is.
Right. They just they achieved it. They really got there.
Definitely bringing more stealth or viable stealth into the combat sandbox and having slightly more open sandboxy areas feels like, you know, taking the kind of systems approach of The Last of Us and applying it to this. And it just makes it feel richer without, like, slowing it down. It's still a very sort of cinematic version of stealth.
And it feels like it's designed to be sort of stealth until it ain't. And then that's fine because there's like you're in you're in a gunfight. Iconic giant set pieces, amazing visuals on all those different global locations.
And it's a really good, like, world hopping adventure, you know, for all the madness of, like, the collapsing clock tower and then being dragged by the jeep, you know, that it can also then just take a beat to have you kind of swimming around some tropical islands with practically no enemies, if any enemies, and just having this big environmental beauty moment, you know, for half an hour, I think is a team that's so confident in their abilities. When I replayed it, I wasn't as into the final quarter of the game. I think it gets a little bit like gunfight in pirate settlements.
A few too many of those, the stuff I really love about it, like the greater variety of locations happens in the first two thirds of the game. That's nitpicking. The final boss is a bit blah, but isn't that always the case in these games?
Yeah. And maybe there's a little bit too much patliocs, but if this is the last one, you want to be able to take the victory lap, and they definitely do that.
I think I largely agree with that. I think the pirate ship stuff on the second playthrough does stand out as, like, it gets a bit too irritating, some of the firefights. You're dying slightly too often, and you're like, okay, I'm ready for this to end.
And yeah, that duel with the final boss is just a tough hang. Apart from the fact that he is a dude losing his shit at how improbable all the adventures he's been on are, that's my favorite bit of that.
Yeah, that's fun.
Yeah, it's just like, he's just like, I can't believe that you, this basically orphan lad, have gone and done all this, and it's driving me like a rich, insane guy, completely mad. And yeah, I liked all that. And I like the fact that it does lead you into thinking Drake's not going to survive.
It gets close enough that you're like, oh fuck, maybe this is like, maybe he is going to pay the price. But also manages to avoid like the skulled wife stereotype that you get in so many of these kinds of stories, you know, where like it's the dude getting back into it, but the wife's like, oh, I'm not so sure. Because she is kind of like that, but she also joins the adventure and just doesn't fall into that stereotype.
So, yeah, really nicely done.
The transition at the start where you have the diving level and you think he's diving for some ancient treasure and then you realize that he's just like clearing shit out from like the river. And then like you get lifted up on that lift and you realize that you're just in like an American city and you're not in some tropical land like that is just that's like a world class bit of like character development like reveal of what his whole deal is now and like the sort of setup for the game like, you know, Indiana Jones, like old Indiana Jones would have killed for that kind of transition, I think.
Yeah, exactly. Just there's nothing like that really in either of the last two Indiana Jones films. So nothing that yeah, it's really nicely done.
Yeah, I actually I keep saving because I know that there's a 60 FPS version of this on PS5, right? I've been keeping that in my back pocket because I know that would be a treat for the eyes at some point. Yeah, absolutely.
So yeah, huge, huge fan of this game. And yeah, it's it turns out Naughty Dog and PS4, you know, two absolutely blinding games, really. Fewer, many fewer games, but the ones they did make were incredible.
And yeah, I guess a shout out to the the rope they added, the climbing Grappling Hook Matthew, just like really that was the thing is like they they actually didn't overdo it with what they added mechanically to to what Drake could do in this game.
But they added just enough for it to like keep you stimulated and for it to feel different, you know, the fact that when you're climbing, you have like like direct control over his hand, like the animation where his hand kind of reaches out to find the next grip is like it's still kind of like press forward to climb. But yeah, it just it just has that extra little kind of next gen touch that makes you feel a bit more in control. It's very elegantly done.
Absolutely. So, OK, slightly confused here. So we come to your number one or wait, is it my?
Yeah, that's right. It's your number one. We come to now.
So your number one.
What do you want to discuss first, Hitman or Dishonored 2?
The order of the podcast is Hitman. So let's talk about Hitman.
OK, I picked Hitman as my number one. Maybe this is, you know, maybe I'm bundling in like later Hitman and what this whole project means to me. But I do think they nail so much of it in this first entry.
Like, this is just a game which of all the games on the list, this is the one which has been with me the whole time, like that I still play now. And I feel like maybe at the time I might have said Dishonored 2 was my favorite game of the year, but I think this has had the sort of the longevity that I've really loved for people who weren't there back then. They obviously released this episodically as different levels at time that actually really, I think is a really key part of its appeal and why it worked for me.
Because you were left with like a level and you had a month to kind of get to grips with it. And this is a game which really rewards replaying the levels. There's a big challenge system where completing, you know, tens if not hundreds of tasks within a level kind of earns XP, which then unlocks more weapons or other places that you can like enter the level from or disguises or extra tricks, which in turn makes your assassination attempts even more elaborate.
So it really feeds into itself. And I don't know if if they had just released this game as a big bunch of levels. Maybe you would have just played through all of them and gone, huh, a six level game.
That seems a bit stingy. But the fact that they really left you to kind of stew in those levels, I think gave us time to lock into what they were trying to do. And I find this game's celebration and encouragement of mastery to be just one of the best examples of that in any game took me back to the kind of relationship I hadn't had with games since probably playing like GoldenEye and Perfect Dark, where back then you used to play things endlessly because they're the only thing you had.
And they had like time trial systems and the cheat modes and all that to try and get you to kind of really get to grips with it. But here you have these levels which are, you know, genuinely play a thousand different ways based on how you approach them. It helps that I also love the fiction of Hitman of being an assassin, taking out these absolutely rancid bastards, the very dark sense of humour, the slightly hyper real element of the world where these levels are full of these slightly stereotypical people.
Everything's a little bit like dialed up environmentally. That's true. It feels like being in like a film version of the real world, like not like fake and plasticky.
But the Italian town is just the most beautiful, sun-drenched Italian town. You can imagine the Paris catwalk is just the trendiest looking thing. You can imagine the Hokkaido spa is the most luxurious place you can imagine.
Like that stuff really, really resonates with me. Like it's a properly escapist in a really exciting way. And, you know, we talked about these games an awful lot.
I could point you to several Hitman episodes to hear a sort of wax lyrical about them. Yeah, it was more to see someone create something with so much scope for replaying them, that rewarded you for replaying them, that let you find different things, that had a world that was like deep and wide enough to sustain you for all those hundreds of hours. I just think it's like one of the great gaming achievements of the last decade.
We've said it before, I'd happily have endless new levels added to this. And, you know, that all comes back to them nailing so much of the magic here in Hitman 2016.
Yeah, so I think that what stood out when we've done our rank and level rankings is just like, what a big deal it is for this first run to have Paris, Sapienza and Hokkaido. Just three of the best locations in the entire project in one place. In some ways, it feels like that's like maybe Square Enix Megabucks at work there.
And the big thing what it felt like at the time was 2016, when they released them episodically, it just wasn't being appreciated in real time in the way it deserved to be. People were kind of like forensically taking each level apart bit by bit, which you only do, I think, when they charge you for individual levels. If they just had the whole lot of it at once, much as we did with Hitman 2 and 3, you would like consider the package more holistically.
And I think that that was what they lacked. And it was a commercial, you know, not maybe not a disaster, but poor enough that Square Enix severed ties with IO. So it was a rough fallout from this that it didn't work really as a model.
And it meant it would only really be appreciated for what it would achieve in retrospect, you know. It felt like by the time Hitman 2 came along, people were like understanding what the overall design of it was, what the point of it was. And it's much harder to sell that when you're like, you've got one level, but don't worry, you can play the level over and over again.
It's better when you can have all the levels, stew in them, and then go back to them as you feel and then mask them as you feel. And I think that it just made people think too much about what they were buying, which I've said before in this podcast.
I honestly think without that, just having Paris, I don't know if I would have quite the same relationship with this. Just playing that level back then and really stripping it of stuff, kind of unlocked a play style in my head, which I've now applied to the rest of the series. And it's impossible to say because it is the situation we found ourselves in, and it is how we played it.
I definitely take your point about, for a wider audience, what that meant and the worry there. I really like the episodic nature of it. I think that is part of this season's magic.
Yeah, okay, that's fair. It was certainly interesting, and it did get you to appreciate, I suppose it got you to think about each level in a lot of detail. Yeah, I think this is because for me the true pleasure of it was enjoying what the fruits of Hitman 2016 inside Hitman 2, which is...
They only get stronger, you know?
Yeah, it only gets stronger as an overall project. As you see it accumulate, it's just like, wow, this is a fat array of stuff and hundreds of hours of game, potentially.
If episode one was like Colorado, maybe we haven't done three podcasts about Hitman.
We're the fourth to come on the old games, but yeah. Regardless of how it played out at the time, it's obviously one of the year's best games. Just the perfect form of what you want.
If you appreciate things like great level design and environmental art and things like that, there really is no better series to appreciate. It's just one unbelievable array of places it takes you to and fun and darkly comic possibilities that play out.
To go from Absolution, which was such a miss in so many ways, to this, to clarify your thoughts and rediscover what was really great there. It's kind of amazing, really.
Yeah, absolutely. It's been appreciated now, at least. It's been acknowledged now that Hitman was the peak.
They got there despite a lot of hardship along the way. Hitman 2016. Yeah, Paris.
The first time you experience all of the different scripted events in Paris, you're just like, oh wow, how high they set the bar? Presentationally, it's just out of control, really.
It's when I pushed one target onto a target below, and you were like, oh yeah, these guys are not what they're doing.
Yeah, it's when you go to that auction and there's levels within the level. You're exploring the gardens and you're finding what's going on out there, and there's a helicopter there, and you're like, wow. It's like a movie set version of real life.
Perfect stuff. Okay, last game the podcast to discuss is my number one, Dishonored 2. Well, a 10 out of 10 game, in my opinion.
Just a masterpiece. It took what the original Dishonored did so well, which were basically assassination missions. You would have a target and you would take out the target as you saw fit.
Dishonored did that for most of the game, but then it kind of became, structurally kind of threw things off in the second half and became a bit more like something happens in the story and then you're sort of like playing a game in a more linear, kill a bunch of enemies along a path sort of way. It was still good, but I think everyone kind of like looked at Lady Boyle's last party in the original Dishonored and were like, wouldn't it be cool if the entire game was just this? And Dishonored 2 was that game.
Dishonored 2 was, will take you to a bunch of high concept settings where you have a target and then you will play the game as you wish to play it, right down to you have two different playable characters with different abilities. Emily Coldwin and Corvo. And so, yeah, your relationship to the world would change based on which character you played and which set of abilities you had access to.
So more of a trad. Dishonored 1 powers, like what you were kind of used to. And Emily's powers, which are a bit stranger.
She have like tentacles and stuff. So actually, I'm less familiar with Emily's powers because I play through it as Corvo. But it was like the most polished version of what that dream pitch was, I think.
And, you know, everyone remembers like the environments of these games as like the kind of like stars of these games. But then also there were other things that they would do to push the levels forwards conceptually. So obviously a crack in the slab, a game where you had the ability to switch between two different time frames and see the kind of cause and effect of that.
That was an absolutely like blinding mission. I think as you're playing this game, you're like, I cannot believe they've done this. Some of the environmental ideas in this and some of the larger concepts and sometimes just like taking you to a place and wowing you with the scale of it or the amount of locations you can kind of pick through and just the, you know, the ways in which you could master this game were truly extraordinary.
I think like one thing you could say that separates Dishonored 2 from Hitman 2016 or Deus Ex Mankind Divided, which are like games that are in a similar sort of stealth action space. I think that Dishonored 2 allows you to perfect it in this like athletic, mind-boggling, speedrun type way that I don't think you could really, I don't think you could really play Hitman 2016 and Mankind Divided with the, and have the same sort of extraordinary video results of like mad Spiderman types of shit that I saw people doing with Dishonored 2. I think that's because it puts a bit more power in your hands in terms of like how you resolve things and how the action plays out.
It's a bit less binary in the results of what you would do, I would say. That's a bit of a vague way of putting it, but I think it's just, it's just true. It's just a bit more wide open, consequence driven kind of game.
So real good, Matthew, Dishonored 2. How come it's not a just blow Hitman for you in this list?
Like it's a close thing. Like I said, at the time I probably would have said this was, I agree with you, it's a 10 out of 10, but Hitman is also a 10 for me. So it's as close as they come.
Is Cracking the Slab your favourite level?
I think it's probably The Clockwork Mansion because the novelty of watching the entire world change around you is just, that's just always incredible, I think.
I really like the one where you have to work out who's the target and who's the doppelganger. You're in like his quite abstract house in its grounds, but there's two of them and you've got to work out who is fake is from like reading clues and stuff. That every level has a hook like that is very, very satisfying.
Yeah, there's even like the, it's basically the evil doctor who you have to make good, and like that one on the, is it like a, is it kind of like a sort of island prison type set? Yeah, that's sort of like an asylum, right? Even like that as a kind of like concept and location and like what you're up against and the ways in which it can play out.
It's just proper immersive sim stuff, but with a real cinematic edge to it.
Yeah, it was good. And of course the legendary like Jindosh lock, the idea of like a level, you can basically skip a whole level if you just do a very difficult puzzle instead. It's like, do you want to do this level to get through this door, or do you just want to try and work out this very difficult logic puzzle?
Incredible, really. And yeah, all of those locations are just so extraordinarily brought to life. That's the thing about Deus Ex Mankind Divided, it's like limitations.
I think you only get a real tiny little snapshot of that world. And what the snapshot you get is good. But in Dishonored 2, it feels like you're in these actual places, and the scale of them is just out of control.
They've done everything to make sure those levels feel as grand and all-encompassing as they can do. So that's why it's a 10 for me, where I think Mankind Divided is a 9. So Matthew, we come to the end of the list.
We did it. Another top 10 down. Very strange episode.
First I get started down, then got slightly jollier as it went.
Well that's because we started off with the sad stuff, and then we got to all the games that we liked.
Yeah, exactly. It's like the cone of good podcasting. So a few honorable mentions here.
I've mentioned a bunch of mine already now, but like Firewatch and The Division, those are the games I was weighing up for the top 10. Also had like XCOM 2, which came out this year. Never quite got my arms around that one in the way I did with Enemy Unknown, so didn't quite feel confident putting on my list.
Matthew, any from you?
I liked Pony Island and the arrival of, is it Daniel Mullins?
Yeah.
His sort of like fourth-wall breaking, evil possessed arcade machine game. I actually really liked Unravel, the EA platformer where you played as the little yarn creature.
Oh yeah, Yarny.
Yarny. The Yarny who has something of a devil about him, I've always thought. He looks like a little demon.
Something very sinister in his little eyes, but the idea of like using his body and unraveling his body to sort of swing around, I thought was very cute. I actually, I took a game I played loads on, mainly for the magazine, but it weirdly got its hooks into me. Was Plants vs.
Zombies God of Warfare 2?
Oh right, that was a hard pass for me that one.
Maybe it's because it was like a slightly lower stakes online shooter with a kind of cartoonish sort of Pixar-y aesthetic from the Plants vs. Zombies game, but that was, I don't know, maybe that was the online shooter that was more my speed rather than all these other scary games where I just get like nuked by teenagers. But I did play a fair amount of Battlefield 1, which I was always bad at, but it was properly spectacular with those giant war machines that would come in, like the big blimp or the evil kind of tank train.
And there was a slight sort of silliness to it. You know, obviously, you think going back to World War 1, it's going to be like the ultra grim kind of everyone dying from fucking mustard gas the whole time. And actually, it was a bit more like rollicking people riding around on horses having a great time.
So it's nice that we managed to like reclaim World War 1 as the fun war.
Yeah, the good content war, you know, as opposed to like the no content war. Yeah.
And Forza Horizon 3 very almost made the list. I just think that they really, really perfected the formula in 4. But 3 was the Australia one.
So it had all the amazing kind of coastal highways you could tear along. But then it also had dirt track kind of in the desert. Many amazing competent racing games in one, which is kind of the magic of that series.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I played a little bit of this one, but I played a bit more of 4.
So yeah, I'm looking forward to discussing that at some point. But yeah, really kind of came to came to life this year. I had a few more, Matthew, for you.
So I had Abzu, the underwater narrative kind of game, which I quite liked. That wasn't really close to getting on the top 10, honestly, but I thought it was a cool little game. Hyper Light Drifter was this year.
It was quite a tough sort of action game, but with amazing pixel art. Kind of like became a bit of a runaway success. I like that game, but not quite enough to put on my list.
Oxenfree, that came out this year too. So it's sort of like teenage spooky horror adventure game with a cool ending hook. Now has a sequel, not played a sequel.
Not sure I need a sequel, but you know, cool for that team that they, night school they're able to like get on the map because of that. Mirror's Edge Catalyst, which I really enjoyed.
Oh yeah, I was surprised that didn't make you top 10 actually.
Yeah, I really liked it and it had some truly amazing standouts. But I think I just, I think versus the likes of Titanfall 2, it's just too flawed a game to have a place in the same list. So he says, you know, knowing that Final Fantasy XV is a deeply flawed game.
So yeah, those are kind of like my, oh, one other one actually. I did consider and I did play a bunch of to try and like get a grip on it during the pandemic. Watch Dogs 2.
So really tried to like mix things up with a San Francisco setting and that setting was quite vivid and cool and the characters are a bit more likeable than the first game. Obviously, that was a deliberate choice. But mechanically, I just don't think I ever quite clicked with the hacking things stuff in Watch Dogs.
I don't think they ever like made that exciting enough to be the premise of the whole game.
It looked like it was going to be like fun GTA again.
Yeah.
You know, like lots of goofy, wacky stuff. But I still found the central gang very trying. I just thought, I think Watch Dogs is just a bit of a no from me as a series.
I think like without them reinventing that power set, I feel like what you can actually do with the hacking is never capture people's imaginations, really. It's like boring immersive sim stuff, basically.
It's just used to do what you can do in every stealth game. It's like hacking a machine so it makes a distracting sound. Is that any more interesting than throwing a penny so it makes a distracting sound?
Yeah. It's just like, really? Is that all we've got?
It's a hacking skin on a game I've played too many times.
Yeah. I don't know if it ever ends up doing this sort of thing, but I always thought the powers were going to be more like, you take the power out in a block to escape the police and stuff like that and all the lights would go out and that sort of thing. But if it was more like, mess with the traffic lights or make this car go forward slightly to crash into another car.
Yeah, I don't know. It just didn't quite do it for me. The man with emoji.
Is that emoji head guy in this one as well? He doesn't have a face, he just has emojis instead?
Is he called Wrench?
Something like that, yeah. I agree they were a bit of a tougher hang, but they were at least not self-serious, I suppose, like Aidan Pearce was. But hey ho, I think I'm with you there on Watch Dogs, even though I always like people taking a swing at bringing a real-life city to life.
And they did a good job with the San Francisco, it's pretty cool. Yeah. Okay, any more from you Matthew, are we done?
I did like the little VR thing that they did for Rez Infinite. I remember playing that actually on PSVR and they added that like crazy, is this Zone X?
Yeah, yeah.
The VR bit and that is like a complete holy shit audiovisual thing. I've done that again on PSVR too and it's just, that's pretty overwhelming. But I don't want to pretend to be a big Rez head because I think I've established myself as simply too square to fully understand it.
I didn't experience full synesthesia.
Well, it's just like, it's like five levels Rez, isn't it? And then you're just sort of done. It's a very short game really.
You could be a Rez head quite easily, I think. It's not that, that.
Yeah, I just don't really get.
Evergreen game though, you know.
Yeah, for sure.
Yeah. Okay, cool. In which case the podcast is done.
We have reached the end of another three hour epic. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I'm at MrBazzle underscore pesto.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter. The podcast is Back Page Pod on Twitter.

Any support is always appreciated, of course. The podcast is ad-free, as previously discussed. Next week, we got a mail bag that we're going to, like, I don't want to say fart out, but it's going to be like...
We are going to fart it out.
Because we're both away at Gamescom, so we need a quicker episode. But I imagine it will end up being quite good fun by the end of it, Matthew. So, yes.
Thank you very much for listening. I'll be back next week. Goodbye.
