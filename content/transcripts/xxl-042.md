Hello and welcome to the Backpage XXL, a patron exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.

Matthew
00:31
Hello.

Samuel
00:31
Hello, Matthew. Bit of an energetic one to uh to see us out there, a bit of an energetic Matthew Castle. Yeah. Yeah, you know, reflecting all the energy I've stored up from my days of sitting on the sofa and eating foxes biscuits about the tin. Um and annoying my dad when he comes back and realizes that all the ones he likes are gone. And that basically sums up my Christmas.

Matthew
00:51
So uh fantastic.

Samuel
00:53
Yeah, final pot of the year. How's your how's your break been so far? It's been nice.

Matthew
00:57
I'm enjoying this week of being back at home and just ingesting. all the media that, you know, is either available to stream or presents that I got for Christmas or games that I'm mopping up. So I always enjoy this post-Christmas sort of cleaning the plate, you know, getting all the gravy with a bit of bread.

Samuel
01:19
Yeah, me too. I've um I've uh watched so much TV in so many films over the past week. Like I haven't really gone anywhere, done anything. Um and I haven't played any games for like the whole week while I've been away actually apart from one day when my brother took me to a pl an arcade in Plymouth where you put You give 'em like ten quid and then you just play anything in the arcade until you're gone basically. Oh nice. Um what what I actually realized it is is a minimum security prison for small children where their parents don't want to do parenting anymore, so they're like Here's £10, it's your problem. Teenage boy works behind the counter. I'm just gonna unleash my six children to run around playing air hockey and chucking basketballs everywhere.

Matthew
01:56
That was basically the experience, so um That's probably like a smarter way of getting people into an arcade than running it as a legit arcade.

Samuel
02:05
Yeah, I think so. It was actually like pretty good. I mean it had a a decent array of machines. Um and it was that thing where yeah you just have an infinite amount of you know credits for everything. So We just played that uh not very good Mario Kart arcade game that has worse graphics than Mario Kart World on the Nintendo Switch 2 that I already own. Um but um it was interesting to get to just go through every single track and that with my little brother and just be like, oh, I now have the full measure of this entire game which previously I only played by putting like two quid in, having one really unsatisfying go on it, and then just moving on with my life being a bit angry, you know. You ever played that one Matthew? I I actually haven't.

Matthew
02:44
I've s I've seen it plenty of times. I'm on quite arcade averse to putting my money in. I just never have change and I never go into them. But I do like the idea of like a queue of five year olds for a for a uh uh Oh, I've absolutely fucked this. I've forgotten how much mate.

Samuel
03:02
You've forgotten how to podcast.

Matthew
03:04
I have forgotten how to podcast. As I was coming up to the game name, I was like, quickly, you've got to work out the game name, but Mario Kart Arcade? No, it's got ghosts. The arcade game, Ghost. Ghosts and Goblins? No, the Sega light gun game. Oh Ghost Squad. Ghost Squad. That's what was happening. I was as I was coming up to it, I was like, I've got ghost and then my head was going, Ghost trick, ghost trick. It's like it isn't gonna work if I say ghost trick Uh well that's okay Matthew.

Samuel
03:33
This is just a dress rehearsal for the podcast. We'll start the real recording now. Hello, welcome to the podcast. I'm Sammy Roberts, joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello.

Matthew
03:41
How's it going, Matthew?

Samuel
03:42
You good? How's your Christmas been, Matthew? Yeah good.

Matthew
03:44
Just mopping up the games like they were gravy.

Samuel
03:46
Yeah. Oh like as if you had bread to get rid of the gravy, yeah?

Matthew
03:50
Yes.

Samuel
03:50
Yeah. Like that. Okay, yeah, perfect. I've been eating um foxes biscuits from the tin. Uh you'd never guess what my dad, livid, because I ate all the biscuits that he likes and he was he was furious. I went to this arcade actually and uh yeah played bit of Mario Kart with my little brother and uh do you know one machine they didn't have? there was uh Ghost Squad, the uh Sega Light Gun Game. And if you've got anything to add on that, Matthew, or uh shall we move on to the subject of this this week's episode, the final episode of the year. Let's just do that. Let's have a third intro. Hello and welcome to the Page Back podcast, the XXL Patriot tier. Um things are not okay here at the end of 2025.

Matthew
04:29
Um okay, so I really hope none of our new Guardian audience has uh decided to join us for this episode.

Samuel
04:35
It has all gone a bit uh a bit wrong, hasn't it? A bit disheveled at the end of the year. But we have forgotten how to do this. I mean there were several episodes before the break where I just forgot how to do the intro. And um poor old Jay Bayliss came on the episode where I ha I had two beers and then w and was clearly just not there all the way throughout the episode and That was um that was poor podcasting as well. And yet, despite that, Matthew, we continue to thrive and um and make good episodes. I think people really like the game of the year one so far. The sort of trickling in the feedback I think as people get through all three hours of it over the break. Yeah. And um I imagine some people are saving it for the first commute back next Monday. So fair play. Anything to get you through the misery of that experience, I suppose. Um but this we do this every year. Best TV shows and films that we saw this year. And uh yeah, it's um we'll discuss whether it was a good year for either films or TV. Spoiler alert. Um but definitely some cool stuff to discuss nonetheless. Looking forward to that. Um so to kick us off, Matthew, we'll talk about movies first. Then we'll take a quick break and uh come back and talk about TV shows. Was it a good year for movies, Matthew Castle?

Matthew
05:42
Uh I th I thought it was a s solid enough year. I actually think it was quite similar year to the year I had with games where There weren't many standout, like legendary Insta classics for me. And it created this huge pool of like four out of fives to to try and gather into this top ten. But I I don't know, I feel like, and I probably said this last year and it's just an ongoing trend. Every year I feel slightly more disconnected from films or that I have a more casual relationship with them. I still watched a hundred and eight of the things according to Letterboxd, but like, you know, I'm not listening to film podcasts. I'm not really reading like film criticism as much. So, you know, when I was looking back through some of the top fifty lists of the year, there were quite a few things that completely passed me by or I hadn't heard of, more like art house or sort of world cinema. But um by my standards I've got a more casual relationship. You know, I'm still seeing some, you know, way more than the average punter, I would think. Yeah, I feel like you are more on top of this though.

Samuel
06:51
Well, it's funny because I I wasn't traditionally on top of it, but the last post COVID I've definitely been a bit more, you know, proactive with trying to see films. Uh that was definitely true this year up until The last month of the year where after we saw all those films during the um the film festival season in the UK where we caught all those movies and for London and Bath that we talked about on that Patreon episode. Um I I just hit a busy work and podcast period where I just didn't get time to see anything. So I've not seen Avatar still. I've not seen um that second wicked film and I probably won't see that until it comes out on streaming now because people seemed a bit down on it. I quite like the first one. despite all the shit CG and the fact that it was about eight hours long um but it was still still enjoyable. Why are they so fucking long those films? Why aren't they both ninety minutes and then like combined you get a solid three hours of film. I don't really get that.

Matthew
07:46
I mean they they made up some songs for the second one that weren't in the musical to pad it out because they think they were worried it was going to be too short and You know, trust me it was not too short.

Samuel
07:55
Yeah, so um there's a few things I'm I'm yet to catch um and some films have just missed. uh UK release dates where they've had US release dates already which is annoying um like Testament of Anley and Hamlet are pretty much the two Oscar films I've yet to see. And then everything else is a little bit smaller. Um looking forward to seeing that new 28 years later film, but I think that's technically like the first film that comes out next year, basically. So we've got a bit of time. Um yeah, so um I've been reasonably on top of it. I've not seen many more films in year. Many of the films I saw this year were old films as well. So um Yeah, but I do largely agree with you on the landscape of them. It is it is a bit of a a f a four-star pick your favorite four-star film still. Similar to the the video games thing, like you say, um a year of eight out of tens. And um that's not a bad thing. It doesn't I don't think there was a shortage of four-star films as such. Um but yeah, the things that were Very tip top. There are a couple of things that people that critics really like this year that I thought were just just quite good. Um and then a couple of things that Critic Sourdon that I found myself liking, I know I worried about veering into contrarian territory a little bit, um just because I wasn't quite jiving with the the way that people are talking about this stuff. But I think a key thing for me is I s I've stopped listening to the big picture. So now I'm just a bit more like I'm trying I'm trying to just feel it out on vibes rather than just having these opinions piped into my head. I think it actually that's just my that's how I feel about after um the overhype for one battle after another. I think that That made me realize that I don't want to engage with the the film bro sphere of how this stuff is discussed and hyped up because it actually just sets me up for disappointment and I'm better off just Going in cold and seeing what the deal is.

Matthew
09:44
So yeah, I'd agree with that. I have really enjoyed uh uh having a subscription to Vulture this year. um which I think I picked up last year in a sort of cheap Black Friday sale. But has has become one of my most valuable you know, online website subscriptions and I I really like their film team there. I think their their reviews are always not not necessarily like spot on as in I always agree with them but Uh I think they're really well pitched in that I can like understand there are some film critics who are just so wanky and out there that I have to read the thing like five times just to pass what's being said, but I find them super accessible but also really smart and switched on. So that's that's been a really nice accompaniment to my film watching year for sure.

Samuel
10:31
I get you. W when it comes to like the Guardians critics, for example, they are so all over the map with TV and film that I just don't know really where I stand with them. Like I Yeah, I'm a bit of a Bradshaw defender.

Matthew
10:42
I'm just because I've been reading him so long that I kind of know where and when we're on the same page. Well st Stu Heritage, what about him on the TV side? He's he's he's more of a columnist who occasionally dips into criticism. That's no sight on him, I'd just say that's how I Fair enough.

Samuel
11:00
Um yeah, so uh I yeah, I don't know, I'm I'm sort of a I guess I've now built up enough basic knowledge of film to understand who distributes all these things, who like makes all these things and what to kind of like keep an eye out for. And I'm sort of like just going based on based on that and the release schedule a little bit and then just what I see on letterbox as the response. And um Sort of seeing what kind of explodes out of those film festival seasons is helpful, but like I say this year definitely feels like it steered me a little bit wrong on the hype side. Um but um that's okay because there's still loads of films I enjoyed this year. S Um lots of cool stuff that we checked out and not all of it was reached that four star um bracket. But I never only the first three months of the year did I feel like, oh god, this is gonna be a diabolically bad year for films. And then and then the the summer blockbuster season was just shocking this year as well. Um just you know, absolute crap. And um when it comes to the ongoing discourse around Avatar, I think like the thing I've settled on with Avatar is that Yes, the cultural impact of it might be limited in terms of people talking about it afterwards and whatever, but it is still of a quality in terms of how it's made how it looks that towers above something like the latest Jurassic World film or whatever shite is pushed out for kids this year. Right. Um like that Elio film that came out this year. Then there was all that stuff about how they stripped out um uh like apparently an LGBTQ plus themed um subplot. So what was left on the in the film was basically nothing and everyone hated it and no one saw it. Or like Tron Ares where you're like w who is this for? Who cares? You know what I mean? It just that that side of films has never been worse to me. Um and our and our own uh our own uh sort of like blockbuster that should have should have delivered but didn't was Final Reckoning, which I know you liked more than me, Matthew, and um I'll be curious to see if it comes in your up in your list, but that was a major dud for me this year. So um some sites of film didn't deliver but others did. That's my rambly way of of setting us up for this conversation, you know? Yeah. I agree with that. Okay, so what's your number 10 then Matthew?

Matthew
13:07
My number 10 is definitely the shakiest film on this list. But as I was going back through my letterbox reviews, this is one that jumped out of like, you know what, I think I actually like that a little bit more in hindsight. And that is Spike Lee's Highest to Lowest. Oh, still gotta see this. It's really messy. I mean it literally feel feels like two films in one uh a kind of a kidnap drama about a a music executive who fears his son has been kidnapped, uh but it turns out that it's it's uh the son of one of his friends, and he's stuck with a dilemma of whether he sort of honours that friendship and helps his friend out even though it's gonna put him in like, you know, financial danger and You know, that in itself is really interesting, but then spike Lee Lea's and all this other stuff which really gets in the way, well not necessarily gets in the way that competes with it, you know, it's also about the state of hip-hop. and can Denzel Washington make this music label uh work? Uh it's got some really honking turns from basically all the actors playing policemen in this. Feel like they're in another film. It's so uneven. But there is a scene towards the end, which I won't spoil, a face-off between Denzel Washington and someone that is so electric, you are like Oh yeah, Denzel Washington is like one of the best actors going, and I had completely forgotten that. Or rather, he hasn't hit that standard for so long. And like almost for that scene alone, you come out like crackling with this positive energy. So it's yeah, uh uneven as hell. You know, but uh I uh I think there's some some like must-see stuff in this film.

Samuel
14:53
Yeah, I uh I will definitely get to this. I've got Apple on the go. again, but I did there was just all over the map kind of responses to this. Yeah. And weird as well because it's been quite a long time since um that fucking Netflix film that was out in COVID. Wasn't that the last Spike Lee film? And that was Five years ago. So um to five bloods. And yeah, that's a that's a long old time. I don't think there was a film in between, right?

Matthew
15:19
So I don't think so. I mean he's super prolific. But yeah, it just the the there's a version of this film which is a bit more paired back where it it's really adjacent to like inside man. Like it's a it's a New York thriller. But there's so much other stuff going on in here that I I think that's very, very murky. But so so just bear that in mind. It isn't an out and out recommendation. I know that it's funky in places, all right?

Samuel
15:47
Better than his remake of Old Boy is what I saw on Reddit today. Yeah. Okay, Matthew. My number 10. I try to avoid anything that is technically from 2024 in these lists because Um if a film distributor releases something in America but decides the UK is a second class market, they can have it later. I'm a bit like fuck fuck you about the whole thing because That's not my problem, that's your problem. So you're not going on my list. However, I have just realized late on here that friendship, my number 10, is technically from last year. So that's annoying that that that that's made it in here. um because it means that uh another film that I like doesn't make it in the list um as a result of that criteria. Um oh well. Um nonetheless um I like this film about ten times more than Matthew Castle did. Matthew watched it during COVID and had a really bad time. As has been documented on this podcast. Um, I am not um a huge fan of uh Tim Robinson. Um uh not not in theory. I wasn't a fan of his sketch show. Um I watched the whole season of it during COVID. I know everyone lost their minds over that. And um I've seen all the gifts, yes, well done on using those gifts there.

Matthew
16:50
I wonder if COVID is the thing that shouldn't be combined with him. That's corporate with both of our experiences.

Samuel
17:00
Yeah, and you know, I I will rank those gifts above the shit screaks g shit screak gifts, which I'm fucking sick of as well. But You know, um this film though really hit the spot and it might just be because it wasn't in sketch form, but it was uh continuous and I thought pretty ambitious for what is basically a dark comedy Um so uh Craig Waterman, a reclusive man, meets his new neighbour, um Austin Carmichael, played by Paul Rudd and forms an unexpected relationship with him. As their friendship grows, so does Craig's obsession with Austin. It is about lonely men in the suburbs, striking up a friendship in middle age. and um the chaos and um sort of odd below the surface uh darkness uh that can um uh veri that can sometimes, I guess, be a factor in these relationships or just the inherent strangeness of you know, we're older men and we're making we're making friends and at a certain point does that seem kind of strange? I actually think this uh this film is very perceptive in how it dissects the odd ways in which men relate to each other, the strange kind of like artifice of masculinity and how how we sort of portray ourselves and how we judge each other and how like being being friends being friends with men who aren't um who aren't Matthew Castle or Dave Scarborough um ends up being quite prickly or weird and it's much easier to be friends with women in my experience.

Matthew
18:18
That's somehow I've always found thank you for prefacing that with that.

Samuel
18:21
Well yeah, but you're a very you're a very uncomplicated friend to sort of have. But I I find there's no like competitive masculinity between us, right? And I do find that a lot of uh times sometimes when you make friends with dudes, it's a bit of Like you have to there is a bit of that feeling each other out vibe to it. This film is just spot on at like someone who's a bit too lonely oversteps And then everything just kind of unravels. And I found that very perceptive and it is the co the commitment to an escalation of that one joke that I really liked. It does make kind of make me want to check out his TV show, um, The Chair Company. um which I've heard good things about um because again it's the maybe it's a sketch thing that doesn't really work for me. Um and he does have very annoying fans as I discussed on a previous episode. People in the cinema were just laughing at his um his uh face um before he'd even did anything um when I went to see this and that really annoyed me. But I really like the film. I thought it was great and um yeah it stuck it out to to reach my top ten Matthew any thoughts on this?

Matthew
19:18
You know, I wish I wish you well. I wish this new friendship with Tim Robinson well. Um I hope it goes better than some of these other friendships you've described, which have been so awkward. I know this isn't like a really unfair thing to aim at most comedy, which is which is completely ridiculous, but I I just never for a second bought that a human being would behave in the way that he behaves. That's my big problem with him. I'm there like, nope, no way, no way could you have a job and be that guy. No way does someone this weird get a wife, get a family, get a job. It just doesn't function like any any human I recognise. And Lovely Mara.

Samuel
19:57
My brain can't get over it, I'm afraid. Well I think that is the the reality of it I think you buy into is that It kind of is one long sketch, really. Like there isn't and that is the and it is just that commitment to that one joke, which I know again it's a whole Tim Robinson thing, but It seeing it played out in this narrative form and just the again, it's the way the let the the layers are sort of peeled back. I just think it works really well. Um but you know I I You know, I I think we can say that Tim Robinson definitely an acquired taste, and I'm sure he would understand that people perceive him that way. Um but the pi and um I'm still not fully committed to his stuff, but I was very impressed by this. Um so yeah, kind of curious to see if he makes anything else else in this vein or if he Sticks to TV, I guess we'll see Matthew. What's your number nine?

Matthew
20:45
When number nine, again, maybe a bit shaky, is Black Bag. Oh yeah, not on my list, but it was in my top twenty. There's just so few thrillers made this year. Like if anyone's working in genre, it tends to be in horror, which isn't really my bag. my black bag. Um but uh yeah, this is like a sort of spy thriller, almost like a sort of m uh yeah, a a kind of modern update of Tinker Taylor Soldier's Spy, in that Michael Fassbender plays a person in the Secret Services whose job it is to to find other corrupt spies and learns that there is probably a Well there's someone corrupt uh in his close circle, which includes his wife, played by Kate Blanchett, but uh has these other sort of four agent played by young, upcoming, basically gorgeous people. This in it has all these strange dinner party scenes where He's sort of feeling everyone out and everyone's feeling each other out and they're all spies and so they're bringing their kind of sort of spy craft and the weird kind of passive aggression that comes with keeping secrets professionally, but also there's some sort of soapy drama between some of them and I just I thought this was gonna be really boring. I've only seen it the once and it's definitely coloured by the fact that I thought the trailer for this made it look so generic and then it turned out to be this quite sort of weird character study with, as I mentioned, several dinner party scenes at the heart of it, which I really was not expecting You get Pierce bit pierce bros and absolutely chewing the scenery. Noshin. He's noshin on the scenery. Oh he is. It's disgusting. Um You It's very, you know, late era Steven Sudderberg in that it's sort of genre, it's quite throwaway, it has amazing people in it, a lot of confidence, a lot of just solid craft behind it. And I I I probably picked it 'cause I've just been starving for some thriller nourishment, of which there is very little.

Samuel
22:47
Yeah, it's fair enough. I uh almost unfollowed a couple of the listeners I politely followed on Letterboxd because they were dunking on this so badly. Um but um chose chose not to in the end. Yeah, I um I uh enjoy seeing Fastbender in this kind of role again. Um I think Kate Blanchett increasingly looks like she's made out of vinyl these days, definitely in this film. Um I got big sort of like she is her own Funko Pop energy from from this. It might just be how But she's just a very shiny woman. I don't really know th not the kind of like um the what exactly the um sort what is responsible for that. Um I would also say that guy Tom Burke, like can anyone else bridge the gap between could potentially play Solid Snake and channels like uh David Mitchell slash a games journalist um energy than that time work guy.

Matthew
23:37
Because of the the solid snake is very much the Mad Max mode that he was in. But you can also see him as like seventy-year-old Orson Wells. Being sort of like drunk on Sherry and sort of bellowing like he's a really odd bloke.

Samuel
23:51
He is, he's he yeah, it's just crazy, but he could do both. Like he was so cool and furiosa. And in this he's got slightly like I would say like sort of tubby insecure vibes in at the dinner table.

Matthew
24:03
Which again I'm not judging, but I feel like that's his natural mode. 'Cause I've I've seen him in plays and he's been like that.

Samuel
24:13
Yeah, that's the thing. So uh he's in that film um Living with Bill Knight as well, which is um really good Um this film also features um Marissa Abella, so um you know just mentally imagine your um Hideo Kajima uh sort of reaction uh emoji in the discord there. Um definitely sort of um I think uh quite fun seeing her in this. I just watched all of industry before uh before I saw this and I do even though I do think that the likes of Fastbender and Kate Blanchett are like s a couple of rungs above her in terms of star power. Like I I do like seeing her in things. I do like her voice as well. Um But uh yeah, it was alright. I saw this and the um presence as well, which was alright. And you know, I th I thought he's doing okay. He's still making pretty solid stuff out there, so fair play. Alright, uh my number nine is Pillion Matthew. Um is this on your list? It didn't make my list.

Matthew
25:05
I like yeah, I liked it.

Samuel
25:09
Uh okay, so we have talked about a sword before, of course, but I will give you the old synopsis. Um Colin, a timid man, um played by Dudley Dursley from Harry Potter. um meets Ray, played by uh Norse god Alexander Skarsgard, a confident bike biker gang leader who initiates him into a submissive relationship. Challenging Collins' mundane existence and prompting personal growth throughout through their unconventional dynamic. Um a sweetness, and the case of the case. And sad film, and um, if you ask Math Matthew a horror film about um about things happening in a forest, that's Matthew's uh stub jumper for this. Um I think I actually thought that the achievement of this film was the way in which it managed to remain grounded and sweet despite being um pretty explicit. And, you know, you could say a little bit grotty in places as well. Um, you know, just sort of uh wanking each other off in the cinema or whatever, which does happen in this film. Um It's sort of like manage and I think that's just that's just good it uh a great achievement in terms of being able to bridge that that gap with a very British feeling film is I don't know that it just means that I think you could recommend it to someone, to anyone, and then find something to latch on to in it because it isn't just about that relationship, it is about the fact that Um Alexander Skarsgaard character is is just so um it's just su uh you can't really you never quite feel like you got the full read of what he's about or who he is. Um and meanwhile um the kind of Colin character is much more like he desperately wants this thing but knows he just knows he can't quite have it because of the way he's kept at a distance. Like it's a very relatable romantic um scenario. Um it just happens to have um some bermin in a forest and uh that that is also in the mix. But I thought it was it was it was great and a really good use of Skarskar's particular star power. Man is nearly fifty, but looks absolutely incredible. And when placed at a British dinner table, just looks like it's honestly like you might as well spent a hundred million on CG, you still wouldn't have that level of effect of like, what is this god doing here in Greater London for Sunday uh Sunday roast? Um so there's a lot I liked about this, really good performances and uh yeah, and not an unexpected highlight of the um film season, but um I didn't think it would make my top ten before I saw it, but here we are, Matthew Thoughts.

Matthew
27:39
I really like uh

Samuel
27:40
Admire this film.

Matthew
27:41
I just I thought it was s so sad, but I don't know if it's just that the the thing he was looking for in and the the particular nature of their relationship. It's just so sort of a alien to me as as something that you'd want. So I I just f I just found it quite hard to get out of my own headspace thinking like, man, that is it's terrible. He's really stuck having a terrible time. But then like the terms of the relationship are the terms that he's he's engaging with it and you know, it is something that he's after. So I don't know. I've just seen some people be like, this is like a comedy. I'm like, ah I found it I found it so cold and brutal in places. Um you know, there's a version of this. Like all the scenes with his parents is almost like a quaint British comedy that you'd you know, like the full Monty or something. It's kind of like, oh a culture clash, these worlds collide. you know, his stuffy parents meet this guy. And you know, there's some big laughs and and it definitely works in those terms, but it's also it's just so unflinching in its represent in in the way it shows that relationship and shows their like physical intimacy. That it's it's just so much more hardcore than I was expecting.

Samuel
28:56
Yeah. I think it's I I do th I I found that quite relatable, the idea that there's quite a gulf between what you know, characters might want emotionally, um, despite having something in common they might want physically. I think that is quite relatable, even if like Even if the the specific context of this film is, you know, is quite explicit or something you're not used to seeing in films quite so much. Um there's a truth to it, you know?

Matthew
29:19
Yeah, I I think I was more Mm, shocked and surprised is the wrong word, but there is something quite strange about seeing you know a character who who is quite cartoonish to begin with, th the the sort of hero of this film, and gets pulled into this world and you think, Oh, this is going to be quite a cartoonish version of it. And it's so real, the the relationship he has with Skarsgard. And, you know, he becomes so much more it's it is you know, it it's maybe like seeing a character from, you know, the full Monty or Calendar Girls or something like that pulled into something just incredibly s you know psychologically nuanced and that was a bit of a oh oh my god you know like it's quite a quite a daring thing to try and do really Yeah, okay.

Samuel
30:06
Well, um it's uh I always enjoyed discussing this film with you or making jokes about Wario in relation to this film, Matthew. Um what's your number eight?

Matthew
30:16
Oh I mean incredibly throwaway compared to Pillion Uh Frankenstein. Oh, I almost made my top ten actually. Yeah, I I put it here, I've I used to be, like, massively into Guilma del Toro. Like I really just liked his whole shtick and thought he was you know, gonna be like my guy for life, but I haven't really enjoyed uh some of his recent films as much as a bigger one. I he almost got like too legit in a way, or too like sort of sophisticated and lost some of the the sort of pulpy you know, extreme weirdness of some of his earlier films and that was that was sad and I I don't know if he's necessarily found it. This is still quite a mainstream taling of Frankenstein. There's nothing too out there in it, but it was lovely being reminded of how much I love just his like attention to detail, like the incredible set design, the costumes, the music. It's just It's so sort of opulent and you know there are stretches of this film which maybe work better or or are slightly richer. I th you know, I think the actual making of the monster and all the stuff set in the the kind of weird water tower that he that he finds, you know, are are, you know, visually extraordinary and and just so interesting to watch. But it it was more like I think there was enough of of older Guilma del Toro in here, you know, off the leash than he has been in like, say the shape of water and um Nightmare Alley, which I didn't really like at all. So yeah, I uh this this was just like uh he still got it. And there were quite a few examples of that this year of of directors who you know, have maybe been a bit wobbly or haven't quite done it for me. Coming out with like one of their stronger films in a while, which was quietly reassuring.

Samuel
32:05
Yeah, I like this film too. I mean I think it is too long for sure. It's You know, it's about almost three hours long. And you get a pretty long sequence of Oscar Isaac and Christoph Waltz hanging out and talking about money and experiments and all this stuff for about 45 minutes where you're like you could probably have cut about 15 out of that. Um and it looks like Christoph Waltz is about to go and play that same guy again in uh Dracula a Love Tale. I saw a trailer for that and he looks like it's the same guy. It's another dude and a dude in like old timey clothes who's got like a maybe a walking stick or something. And you're like, yeah, we'll see.

Matthew
32:48
But I like that your brain is sort of Willem Dafoe is playing Christoph Walt's role in Nosferati.

Samuel
32:57
Yeah, every time I see Christoph Waltz, I sort of think, have you had a good career? Like you've been I don't know if it it was like maybe the two Tarantino films were the the peak and everything else has been a bit meh with him. Um stunk out the joint in only murders in the building this season. Oh that's tough. I wasn't a fan of him in Bond either. That didn't didn't work, even though on paper it should have done. Um but I thought Jacob Ballordi was fantastic in this. I actually thought Oscar Isaac was great as well. He was He sort of embraced I've never seen Oscar Isaac embrace like being a tiny man. Um but he has to in relation to uh a Lorty who it just towers over him. But He suits being sort of like slightly impotent, um, sort of Napoleon complex tidy man in relation to him, and it's so different from Normally you're seeing Oscar Isaac look a bit s like a look a bit smoldering or sad or you know what I mean? Like it's he hasn't really done this persona before, but he is a little bit A little bit pathetic and he d and he sort of hams it up in a way that I think is really entertaining. While a lordy does this very um soulful performance Um very restrained use of Mia Goth in this film. She's in two roles in this, but um I would say that she doesn't go full Mia Goth in the kind of Pearl fashion. Um which I think is actually a good a good thing. You don't need that overpowering the filter.

Matthew
34:12
Well that's the thing, she's quite a strong like flavour of presence, you know. She's like cloves. You don't want to put too many cloves in your cooking. Yeah.

Samuel
34:22
Um but she does enhance the film and it just adds up to a very solid kind of trad feeling adaptation. Like like like you say, visually spectacular. So I I really enjoyed it as well. I thought it was um I went and saw it at the cinema and it was way better than I thought it'd be because like you I felt a bit I thought they were both kind of like I thought Nightmare Rally was a bit of a two-star film and Shape of Water was a three-star film and kinda thought, oh yeah, he's just uh he makes um orn you know, ornate looking but quite plain or forgettable films now. But um no, this surprised me and gave me a bit of um bit of hope for whatever he does thanks, Matthew. So okay, my number eight is weapons. Is this on your list? It isn't. Oh, I thought this would be the first higher on my list, but do you know what I could kinda get why it didn't quite make it into your um into your list. I do think there's a bit of a Shyamalan effect with this film. Um so Synopsis When all but one child from the same classroom mysteriously disappear on the same night at exactly the same time, a community is left questioning who or what is behind their disappearance. And what plays out after this is kind of a Uh I don't say ration on exactly, but you do flip perspectives um between the different characters and see uh as you piece together what happened to these kids, the way in which the kids community is reacting to these kids disappearing. And um it does have an absolutely um brilliant cast. I would even say that's probably like the best thing about it. You've got um Josh Brolin as the father of one of the children who went missing. Probably a bit too old for that role, but he's just so so good in it, so entertaining. Um got like the the biggest laugh line in this film um is belongs to him. Um he's really really good. Um Julia Garner is a s quite boozy and um chaotic uh teacher who is accused initially of the kid's disappearance before the truth starts to unravel. Um Alden Ehrenwright playing this um piece of shit, cop, um sort of like U i him too engaging a bit of a sort of like uh paunchy sad man persona, which maybe you haven't seen him do before, um where he's been playing hand solo or whatever, or these quite fresh face kind of roles. Um, just a really uh really good fun and um has a great finale, I think, that even if you don't think the reveal of what happened to the kids delivers as such and I think your mileage on that might vary. The last set piece is just enormously entertaining. And so yeah, a great go to the cinema and see it experience from this year, Matthew, even if it's not something I'm rushing to rewatch.

Matthew
36:47
Thoughts. Yeah, I I'd agree with all that. Um and I I do agree with the the very end being entertaining, but I apart from the very ending, which is the entertaining bit, I the third act of it didn't really do anything for me. In the same way actually I thought with Barbarian. The guy's like all set up, really exciting. You're like, what the hell is this gonna be? And the thing it is in in both films didn't really do it for me

Samuel
37:10
Yeah, and it's the same thing in both films, that's the thing. Yeah.

Matthew
37:14
Uh but it's you know, up until that point, yeah, yeah, very weird. The time structure allows it t to be super confusing and strange. I think you can maybe get like a couple of steps ahead of it too easily. Um it's not quite as as clever and strange as it thinks it is, but I'm excited to see what it does with Resident Evil. Imagine that if there's actually a good Resident Evil film, that would be wild.

Samuel
37:38
Yeah, if it's like you get the end of the film and Chris Redfield's fighting an old lady who's a bit scary looking. I'll be like, uh, here he is, he's doing it again. But um I guess we'll s I'm gonna go.

Matthew
37:51
you know, show the Chris path and the the other path through the game or have the character zapping from Resident Evil Zero.

Samuel
37:58
That would actually be amazing. I'd love to see him do that. Yeah, I do I I do agree. He's got a sort of um it's one of those directors where I think if he gets five films under his belt that are really good, it'll be fine and no one would really think about it too much, but There is just that danger that it goes to Shyamalan route or where everything hinges on what's the mystery behind this, this great premise. And then it doesn't quite come together and people start to sour on it. So it really, yeah, it could go either way with that guy, but um we'll see.

Matthew
38:29
Imagine if the Resident Evil film was two films. that were the two different character routes through the game and you watch both of them and then it unlocks like a secret ending. You know people at Capcom, you can you can make that happen I think Matthew.

Samuel
38:44
What's your number seven?

Matthew
38:45
My number seven is again a little basic bitch. Wake up dead man. It's my number seven as well. Perfect. Well they go, they're not basic bitch. Correct. Two basic bitches. I re-watched it over Christmas with the with uh Catherine's family and I just thought it really held up, but uh, you know, I like the central mystery of it. Obviously that is slightly diminished um once you you've seen it once, but the setup of it is that Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc is called out to assist a priest played by Josh O'Connor, uh, who uh a member of his community has been killed, and it looks like it was him in a seemingly kind of impossible well, it seems like i it's it's kind of an impossible crime, but despite it seeming impossible the blame, you know, the finger is pointed towards him. It ties into some like bigger questions of sort of belief and falling out of love with an idea and, you know, why he became a priest in the first place. And I I think what struck me on both times, but it definitely holds up on the second time was that I just think it had more dramatic meat on its bones, certainly than Glass Onion, maybe more than Knives Out itself. Uh in in terms of him having, you know, an actual kind of, you know, dramatic stakes and a issue that he was trying to work through which was tied into the kind of solution of the crime. Just thought it was a bit more sort of sophisticated, a little you know, quite there's some quite moving turns in it. There's an absolutely fantastic scene where he ends up talking to this woman on a phone and it suddenly turns from like a very daart joke scene into into something like super sincere, which I I really, really like that scene. Maybe kind of bumped it up a position or two, a bit like the Denzel Washington scenes in um highest to lowest. It's just uh I just thought this was a bit deeper than it needed to be. Quite a nice bit of mystery filmmaking.

Samuel
40:42
Yeah, I uh I I really like this too. It is um quite a long film, but I think that What really offsets that is the fact that you are focused on Josh O'Connor for such a large portion of it. And it doesn't feel that long while you're watching it. Um I really love the choice of setting where it's like allegedly upstate New York, but it's clearly just the UK. But they've put some Americans there. I approve of that. That's good. Um another great uh Josh Brolin um turn in this. Yeah. What's there is absolutely wonderful. Um his voice is such a great uh sort of like a special effect in these um in any film that he's in really and uh Yeah, that enhances it. And um the the criticism I've heard towards this this film, which I think is fair, is that beyond Josh O'Connor, you don't actually get a sense of the characters, the different characters being fleshed out. the different potential suspects in the way that you do in um either knives out or glass onion, which I actually think is fair. Like you Jeremy Renner is basically like a prop. Kerry Washington is basically like a prop. They're not hugely significant. You don't know loads about them or their motivations. You get a very superficial glimpse of who they are. But I would again say, but you get so much of Josh O'Connor and that is the It's the two-hander of the film, isn't it? And then when Benoit Blanc does turn up, it's so fucking good. Like it's such a great moment in the film. Um, and then it's just that that again, that feeling of like escalation to the mystery like even if you you think you've worked it out or whatever I think just the the presentation of it in terms of cinematography and the the the sort of like dabbling with horror element of it. Um it's really impressive. So yeah, I I thought this is great. This is uh potentially my favourite of the three. Definitely liked it more than Glass Onion. Um but um I mean what a treat to just Watch with your family on Netflix this year, which I as I assume what most people did, um, except me, because I saw it in the cinema, um, and uh that was a better experience. So uh Yeah, um number six then Matthew, what do you got? I got Blue Moon. Not on my list.

Matthew
42:46
This is uh Richard Linkletter film set on the evening that uh Oklahoma the musical is debuting on Broadway. It's about a songwriter called Lawrence Hart who used to work with the composer Richard Rogers, uh who wrote Oklahoma and he didn't r he didn't write Oklahoma with Rogers and he's sort of drowning his sorrows in a bar on the night that Oklahoma's coming out. waiting to sort of c confront his friend and basically like moaning and hassling an anyone who'll listen to him. And it's about the breakup of a creative partnership. someone feeling like that they're on the way out, but also feeling that he he feels that Richard Rogers is sort of sold out in making Oklahoma. And I I didn't really know much about this guy. Um it's called Blue Moon, 'cause they wrote the song Blue Moon together, as in the one from Bayonetta II. As as it's Oh no, that's Moon River.

Samuel
43:50
Yeah, that's Moon River. Yeah, yeah, I was got a bit confused then. I was like, is it?

Matthew
43:53
Oh I thought maybe it was it later on.

Samuel
43:56
Oh never mind. That's alright.

Matthew
43:57
Or really really butchering this one. Ethan Hawt playing uh Lawrence Hart, who's a very very short man. Uh they use lots of sort of camera effects to make him look Like he's about four foot tall compared to everyone else, which is, you know, quite funny. But it's a classic Linkletter character piece in that, you know, it's all in this one evening in this bar It's him chatting to whoever will listen to him, so you get all these interesting sort of partnerships. He ends up talking weirdly to the author of the Stuart Little books, who also happens to be in the bar. and uh he has all these perfect little sort of ten minute scenes where, you know, in Link Latter fashion he gets to explore ideas about art or general life philosophies and I l I just really like i this mode for him of, you know, people hanging, people chatting, you know, nice little character study, but it does have this you know, a little bit of kind of poison it at the centre in that this sort of bitterness around this creative partnership breaking up and whether that can be renewed. Maybe sort of hits a bit harder if you are into musicals and musical history. There's lots of gags about musicals of the time. There's a cameo from a young Stephen Sundheim who sort of uh trained uh under uh Hammerstein who became Roger's sort of songwriting partner. So uh you know it's kinda like A bit of a sort of Marvel uh Avengers assemble for you know 1950s, 1960s songwriting talent, if that's your bag, um, which it is.

Samuel
45:34
Yeah, I will watch this at some point. There's two Lincoln films out this year, right? There's this and I can't remember the other one. Uh yeah, that's about um French New Wave cinema, isn't it? And uh they seem like a pretty good sort of like pairing in some ways. I know the vibe is different between both of them, but it feels like a a man who's got very particular interests, like diving into, you know, the sort of some of the real-world mechanics behind those interests, I guess, or events behind those interests.

Matthew
46:03
Um I think so.

Samuel
46:05
I think you just sort of

Matthew
46:07
You know, he's a bit of a sort of barfly philosopher, which is just like a classic Lintlatter character type, you know.

Samuel
46:15
Yeah, exactly. And uh I think I would also feel four foot tall in the presence of Margaret Quali. So um, you know, that I kind of I can empathize with. I'll definitely get to this, Matthew. in the bucket of films that I missed um at the very end of the uh the year. So um I I'll see whatever streamer it ends up on, probably movie or something like that, and uh give it a watch. Okay, um my number six is 28 years later. Is this on your list? It is higher on my list. Oh, okay, cool. Um, what's your number five? A real pain. Oh, interesting, not on my list.

Matthew
46:48
Yeah, I I really like this the Jesse Eisenberg uh written and directed sort of comedy drama about two cousins. who go and go and visit the concentration camps with a with a load of uh sort of an American tour group. They're sort of going there to sort of honour their recently deceased grandmother, I think, who grew up and survived in that area. Uh it's him and it's Rory Colkin, who plays his slightly sort of more sort of fucked up cousin and is clearly working through some stuff, is incredibly charismatic. but has issues and it's you know, a kind of a a little bit of a buddy comedy in that, you know, you've got very prickly Jesse Eisenberg sort of being rubbed up the wrong way by Colkin being very similar to you know, his character in succession, you know, very sort of garrulous and sort of fun and overconfident and over familiar. but with this sort of streak of sadness where, you know, s certain cracks show and you sort of see him w you know what he's dealing with. A really old-fashioned bit of like filmmaking for adults, you know, an adult setup about, you know, adult problems, you know, with a great little cast. Or everyone else on the tour like has a role to play. It's incredibly swift. It's like ninety minutes tops this film. And I just loved uh you know how much sort of story and character development they packed into that 90 minutes. It's it seems wrong to praise something purely for efficiency. but I do really like it when a film doesn't waste your time and there just used to be a lot more of these sort of you know, it's sort of high concept dramas of Two mismatch people go for a tour here, what happens? But uh I I kinda miss that style of filmmaking and Uh I thought I just thought this is a really, really good example of it.

Samuel
48:43
Yeah, I did um I did really like the performances in this film. I thought that the s the style of it You kind of mentioned it feels like a maybe a throwback to a different kind of uh sort of high concept drama. I think it feels a little bit like a film from 2005 or something. Like it is a bit It felt a tiny bit outmoded to me. Um that's not to say I didn't think the performances were good. I mean, like you say as well, I couldn't quite get how similar that performance was to his succession role, Rory Culkin. Um Is that Rory Culkin? Actually we definitely got the right one there. I always forget which of the different Colkins. Uh Kieran's the other one, isn't it? Kieran Acid. Roy's the really Colkin.

Matthew
49:23
Yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, Kieran Calvin. My podcast brain is just it it'll be powered up for 2026.

Samuel
49:31
The creator of Bioshock, uh Shigeru Miyamoto Um that'll be uh that'll be coming up.

Matthew
49:35
Kieran Coke in fucking hell.

Samuel
49:38
That's all right, yeah. We are just getting warmed up for twenty twenty six. That's all good.

Matthew
49:42
Well an Oscar for it, should remember that

Samuel
49:44
Yeah, but I don't think he should have done it.

Matthew
49:52
But I I don't know, I liked seeing that performance alongside Jesse Eisenberg's performance. I thought that that drew some other stuff out of it and he was a great foil to him and you know they both sort of play to type and those are two types which it's i it's just fun if you put them together.

Samuel
50:10
Yeah, and I I did think there was some definitely some emotional truth in this and the ending is a real kind of gut punch and uh yeah it it is worth watching. I I thought it was like a maybe like a three and a half star film for me. I can see why um but loads of people like this more than me and I I totally get why. So um yeah it's uh it's okay. I think it j it's just whether that particular flavour of drama is your thing or not, basically. I think that's what it comes down to. Um But yeah, good stuff Matthew. What's your oh it's my number five, isn't it? Um my number five is one battle after another, is this on your list? It's higher on my list. Oh, very good. Then what's your number four?

Matthew
50:46
Twenty-eight years later

Samuel
50:48
Oh nice. Shall I pick up from here? And uh yeah, okay, so okay, so it's been almost three decades since the rage virus as depicted in Twenty-eight days later and twenty-eight weeks later, escaped from a biological weapons laboratory. Um still living in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amid the infected. Um one such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily defended causeway and also a dramatically useful causeway, I would say. Um when one of them decides to venture into the dark heart of the mainland, he soon discovers a mutation that's spread not only to the infected but other survivors as well. Uh I can't say I remember that bit of the film, to be honest. But um I really love this as a kind of re reprise of Britain. Uh the the kind of British zombie film, but the zombies run. And um the particular flavour that Director Daddy Boyle brings to to that type of film. Um it just I think just uh seeing a genre film on this level uh set in the UK is so rare that that was a big part of the appeal of this to me. Um but it does also take the it makes the bold and divisive decision. uh to make this uh basically a grief story yeah or about you know a child's relationship with his mother that's kind of what the film ultimately ends up being about And that means that you get one act of like solid um zombie chasers and zombie danger and like some unbelievably good set pieces that come out of that. um and great sort of world building I would say for what's happened to the UK um since we've been um we've been sort of cut off. There's a bit of a Brexit um metaphor at work here as well, of course. And um yeah so I think that combined with the decision to make it something a bit bolder emotionally just really worked for me. And um there's a sequel to this film out in a few weeks. Um that's got a a load of guys dressed as Jimmy Savile. So I mean And that that ending I mean, I did I did post about this. You could never guess what the final scene of this film would be. And it is a bunch of characters who turn up dressed as Jimmy Savile. Like you would in a zombie apocalypse you would never predict it. But Yeah, I um I just found this really original feeling and engaging and like um a sign that Danny Boyle's really still got it, you know? Because It is filmed before this was yesterday, a film I'll never see, but obviously I know what it's about. It's Beatles connotations, the big boomer energy of the thing. But It's just nice to see him flex his muscles, and it's nice to see him like make another film in this series that I I just really like in general. Um what do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
53:30
Yeah, yeah, I absolutely agree with all that. Um I I liked, you know, I heard it said at the time that this felt as much a sequel to his Olympics opening ceremony as it did twenty-eight days later. Um, you know, in terms of Th there are some like big, you know, big British ideas here and about traditions and society trying to uphold them and what happens to those. in a zombie apocalypse. I found that really interesting. I think the thing I liked most about it was that it you know it has this this f one act like you say where it shows that it's got the the zombie film chops and can be scary and exciting and then shifts away into something very different. Still has a couple of scares, but is yeah, much more sort of sort of soul-seeking st strange drama built around a r a really wonderful turn from r uh Ray Fines. Uh and Never in a million years, like I was really braced to have not a hard time in terms of it being bad, but to have like a I'm being really scared at the cinema and I'm just gonna be very like tense for for two hours and it actually sort of soothed me into a really gentle place and didn't uh sort of break that that kind of promise once it was there, actually sort of saw it through and is sort of weirdly serene um for the for the rest of the film, which I really liked. And like you say, you get to the end and you're like Well, I have to see the next part of this, you know, like just what the hell is it gonna be? Um yeah, I d I th I thought it was brilliant. So good. So and Danny Boyle is like I think he's genuinely a director who veers from like one star to five stars. Like, he's as all over the place as any director there is. Um but when he really nails it and all his weird little gambits pull off, like filming it all on iPhones or whatever, to give it like a very strange look, it's um Yeah, t you know, hats off to the guy. I was not expecting this to be one of the best films of the year.

Samuel
55:37
Him and Alex Garland they just feel like a great Great pair, don't they? Because I think that there's a fundamental cynicism to Alex Garland that maybe Danny Boyle offsets a little bit because he's just such a sentimental fellow.

Matthew
55:49
Um, press interviews for this film with those two.

Samuel
55:54
Yeah, for sure. Um didn't you say you saw Alex Garland popping Renny and what I think?

Matthew
56:02
One second rewatch on Vars. Uh I was like, wait a second, that isn't Rennie.

Samuel
56:10
Yeah, I can't wait to see the the the next one of these. I really fucking hope that Danny Boyle gets to make the third and final one of these because that is like my most anticipated Please make this sequel.

Matthew
56:20
How about they like greenlit it just on the str strength of the initial reaction to the sequel?

Samuel
56:26
Yeah, but if it flops box office wise, I feel like they might still just be like, nah, we changed that. And I just I just really yeah, I'm I really want it to happen, so um fingers crossed because it is cool the idea of filming these back to back and Seeing what the response is. So um yeah. Okay Matthew. Um it come to your number. Oh my number four. Okay, my number four is no other choice. Is this on your list?

Matthew
56:48
Oh it isn't, but I'm only because I I sort of forgot about it as a 2025 film. Yeah, I guess because it's not technically out in the UK yet, right? So This will be in my top ten next year for sure, but sorry, I slightly messed that up.

Samuel
57:04
No, that's alright. Um so um abruptly laid off after 25 years at the same company, a desperate man goes to extreme lengths to eliminate the competition for the job he wants. Well, I won't spoil this film for you because um listeners you have not really had the chance to see it yet unless you're at one of the film festivals we were very fortunate to be at. So um what I will say is that it is very much a kind of uh a f a modern a film about modern working and living and the threat of AI and the idea of people um people's livelihoods being seen as disposable um by larger corporations and the effect that can have on uh people who are settled into their lives and um uh and where the idea of that life b their lives being upended is just uh sort of will destroy them, their sense of self-worth. Um it's a good companion piece to something like Parasite really. Um very much uh Very much in the kind of like vein of how far will you go to get the thing you want, I suppose. Um obviously they are both Korean films as well, um, by different directors. Um Yeah, so I I would say just go watch this and and sort of experience it. It is like a dark comedy, but it is uh it's also like beautifully shot. There's some absolute unbelievable things that um Park Chan Wuok does in terms of how this this huge house they live in is filmed. Um this uh beautiful house and with this kind of greenhouse and these like weird areas of of town that this character goes to um to uh sort of like encounter these other guys who are vying for the same job that he's going for basically. And um and the sort of like situations that play out. They're very memorable locations and great kind of like one-off turns by these actors And um yeah, it's really good at fleshing out the lives of the the family at the heart of the film, but also the different people vying for this same job. And uh yeah, it's um it's it I don't think it's quite maybe like the the top tier of Park Chan Wuk films, but it's definitely like just a tier down from those. Um I would say it's probably about as good as the decision to leave was, Matthew. What what do what are your thoughts?

Matthew
59:16
I maybe like decision to leave a little bit more just in terms of the emotional hook of the characters and their relationship, where this one's got more of a satirical hook. There's still some great character work in it and some really interesting relationships and every performance is is, you know, brilliantly done. Uh I just I I don't know, I found m maybe decision to leave slightly more it like slightly easier to relate to, but then it's a slightly less challenging film in terms of what it's about, decision to leave. Um there's there's absolutely no doubt that if you love you know, the incredibly sort of high performance filmmaking of, you know, Park Chan work and people adjacent to him, like David Fincher or, you know, m I I guess um Bon Junho as well. you you know, you will just see some of the best looking film, the best shot composition, some of the best cuts some incredible audio work in this. There's a there's sort of an attack scene set to music which is so unusual in this film where you just think, oh I've never seen that before. You know, I've never seen someone do something like that before. Um Y so, you know, it's purely pleasurable on those terms, but yeah, it also has this, yeah, very bleak kind of gut punch and one of the sort sort F funny uh ending credits. Um Well I thought it was I I thought it was funny anyway.

Samuel
01:00:45
Um What You're right to highlight the transitions actually. That is kind of the I think that's actually low-key the best thing about the f this film. The way that shots the transitions between shots are just proper sort of Chef kiss, like that is m that's actual movie magic. So um yeah, worth seeing for those stylistic flourishes alone, really. But um yeah, I thought it was It was really good. So number four. Um there it is. Um be curious to know where it would have gotten your list, Matthew. Um I'll find out in a year's time, I guess. Um what's your number three?

Matthew
01:01:15
My number three, bit of an unusual one. Don't know if you got a cinema release. Uh I've picked Steve starring Killian Murphy. Oh right, I've not seen this. Yeah, so I actually watched this uh through work. We do some stuff with Netflix at work, so um it isn't necessarily something I actually say that I probably would have watched this anyway, but it's uh adaptation of a book by Max Porter, Bath's Max Porter. called Shy. Uh weirdly the book was called Shy and is about a troubled teenager at a I don't want to call it like a special education school. It's like a s it's like a s School seems to have been set up for extremely like challenging troubled teenagers, but almo almost like as an experiment to kind of work on giving them like a more classic education and whether they can kind of turn their lives around and the book, I believe, was like all first person narrated by this teenager called Shy. who's still a character in Steve, but as the title suggest, they've refocused it on his teacher, Steve, as played by Killian Murphy. Uh bit of an odd swing that, because Shy is a much more kind of poetic title and would still be a very apt title for what this film is about, uh, because it's a two-hander of Steve and Shy. But uh yeah, it's it's about Keelan Murphy dealing with some of his own personal demons as as this teacher, but also you know, trying to get through to these these lads who are good deep down but very, very difficult, you know, like outrageously bad behaved and obnoxious, like absolute sort of thugs. You know, I think that, you know, it's said several times, you know, if they weren't in this school they'd all be in like, you know, young offenders institutions. Um and that makes it sound like it's gonna be super gritty and hard work, but it has this really like Poetic core in that it is about how this school works for them and improves their lives. You get these little magic moments where everyone like locks in and I guess it's like a little bit of a love letter to, you know, the power of a great teacher and what that can do. But it's also about this institution being challenged by the sort of motherfuckers who own it and run it and don't see the need for it anymore and yeah it just sort of follows may even only be like twenty-four hours of time in this school. And yeah, the ch the sort of shifting relationship and uh there's like a younger teacher who Steve is sort of introducing and sort of training up and Uh that's quite like an quite an interesting little sub-story um played by, I want to say, the British RB singer Little Sims. Yeah, I I just I don't know, I I really love this era of Killian Murphy, basically post-Oppenheimer, but including Oppenheimer where I feel like he's now got the cred that he can basically do what he wants, and he can just make much meatier, more profound fair than the likes of Peaky Blinders, which I know people love, but I think is a little bit beneath him. To admit you know, I don't I don't think it challenges him much. And to see him in films like this and the same director did a film called Small Things Like These a couple of years ago. And they're both just great showcases for a slightly sad 50-year-old man dealing with some shit and Killian Murphy is so good at that. And an actor I'm like growing to enjoy more and more as he gets older and does more of this stuff and someone I didn't necessarily like rate super early on. It's uh yeah, I really, really like it. It's on Netflix. Um, give it a watch.

Samuel
01:04:57
Yeah, nice. That I would I'll definitely go give that a watch after this, Matthew. That's very uh A very full-throated recommendation. Um yeah, that's uh interesting.

Matthew
01:05:06
Oh, there's a great term from Roger Alum in it as well, as like a conservative MP, which is just classic.

Samuel
01:05:14
That's just his wheelhouse, isn't it? So uh that's very much his home turf. So yeah. Um okay Matthew, so my number three, um very similar really, it's Sinners, uh the Ryan Kugler film. Is this in your list? It isn't Um, trying to leave their troubled lives behind, um, Twin Brothers returned to their Mississippi hometown to start again, only to discover that evil an even greater evil. is waiting to welcome them back. It's vampires, spoiler alert. But also this but an analogy for racism, perhaps, and displacement, etc. Yeah, so a very uh very kind of like meaty genre film really like there's a you know there's a lot going on in terms of um themes uh it's it's uh But it's also like a lot of fun. Um it's uh a bit unusual in the and I think it kind of only really has two acts and then an epilogue. Um it's uh it's a little bit strange like that. It's got like one really long Um second act, and which kind of includes all of the the set pieces and all of the kind of like the vampire stuff happens in that bit too. Um but it's also uh a little bit sexy. It has uh Michael B. Jordan playing two different characters, playing Twin Brothers. um both of which are quite each of which are quite different from the other and um have very different uh lives um going on and a great ensemble cast as well Of people, some people you recognize, some people you won't. Um bit of Del Royalindo, which I always appreciate in uh in any film. And um it was a bit of a breakout hit from this year. Um, I don't necessarily think it's like an all-time classic or anything, but I think it is a great it's gonna be one of like the best uh vampire films that's been made. And a genre film where there's obviously a bit of a an auteur's touch to it. And um and yeah, like again, that sort of like thematic richness that uh in the film itself and uh a kind of really fun epilogue as well that maybe hints at other things they can do with the uh the universe of the film. An epilogue that I think is so good that it it actually kind of elevates the whole film. It's it's such a great um such a great sort of like yeah and um end point for that story. And uh yeah, um in general was just really impressed by it, lived up to the hype for me. And um, yeah, haven't I never really questioned it being in my my top three all year Matthew. What do you think?

Matthew
01:07:35
Yeah, I I did enjoy it. I th I thought it was a lot of fun. I just don't know if it ever really takes off As like an action film for me. Once once the vampires turn up, I I didn't think it was particularly interesting. And that's only because it comes after this like sensational sequence where it shows you like the history, you know, past, present, maybe even future of black music all happening at once in real time. It's uh absolutely like baffling almost like a sort of Baslerman sequence or something. And it's it's so out there. It's such a five star moment that I feel like once once the actual sort of vampires turn up and people are just sort of closing the doors and debating about whether to go out or not I'm like, eh i th I don't know if this has quite got the same level of stuff, but it is trying so many things. It is hugely entertaining. I I just found it quite uneven. But I am definitely up for whatever it is that they're pitching at the end. Um kind of a tie with twenty-eight years later for Oh well I'll definitely see that sequel.

Samuel
01:08:40
Yeah, for sure. And uh yeah it's um I think I I think that's probably fair about the the the sort of action sequence side of it. Uh yeah, I I think I probably do agree with that.

Matthew
01:08:51
Um it this is obviously the origins of one of our sort of

Samuel
01:08:55
Well the music sequence you mentioned. Their sad tour and him sitting in an airport by himself. That's much a much better hang than sinners. No, not at all, Matthew. But um no, I just think that again, like it was such a shit year for blockbusters, some of this being

Matthew
01:09:22
I've not put anything above it that's going to offend you, you know? I'm not saying like I couldn't say no to sinners, but yes to dead reckoning. Like that couldn't happen

Samuel
01:09:34
Yeah, it's uh yeah, it's just a it's just a a fun film. I think it just ends it ended up carrying a bit too much on its on its back this film, in terms of like the cultural conversation. It was just a little bit too much like This has to be like it became such a huge deal that that I think it immediately got into like, is this a bit overrated? Is this too big a deal? You know what I mean? Like, and it's just not It shouldn't have to be there.

Matthew
01:09:59
But uh but but weapons suffered from this as well, just it was really unless you saw it on opening day, it was really hard to go into either of these films without certain weird phrases swimming around in your head. Um like for this one definitely I sat down with the knowledge of um like river dancing vampires and I was like well Somehow this film is and then second an Irish guy turned up, it was like, okay, I know what this is I not I know where this is going, but like it it began slotting in and um I would have loved to have seen this one blind

Samuel
01:10:35
Surely the um surely the uh the Irish listeners of this podcast would be more offended by the depiction of that character in this film. than anything we've said about the Irish on this podcast. I would at least like to hope that that's the case, Matthew. Um I will also say Sinners is the origins of one of the best backpage jokes of the last year, which is white sinners Um where like um uh musicians including the likes of Mike and the mechanics um were all playing together. That was like a great gag. I can't remember when that came up, but that was uh Castle Island, I think. Oh yes, Games Court, yeah of course. Um oh so but sorry, I think of Games Court as Castle Island in my head.

Matthew
01:11:13
That's what I call those episodes.

Samuel
01:11:16
That's fair enough. What's your number two, Matthew? My number two is the secret agent. Oh, that's uh my number one. Um so yes, I should have just said higher on my list, shouldn't I? So I fucked it really. But um shall we uh talk about it in a minute then? That's how this works.

Matthew
01:11:32
What's your number two?

Samuel
01:11:34
Uh, my number two is Eddington. Oh, your beloved Eddington. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a standoff between a small town sheriff Played by Joaquin Phoenix and a mayor, played by Pedro Pascal, sparks a powder keg as Neighbor is pitted against Neighbor in uh Eddington, New Mexico. Um, okay, so this film is um was deemed a bad hang um by critics and flopped. Massively. Um it came out and grossed half of its budget. Um it's the second flop in a row for Ariaster. Um the director behind Bo is Afraid, that's the flop, and uh also Hereditary and Midsummer both Um successful horror films. Every time it's gonna make a film, uh I feel like I'm more and more in tune with who he is and his sensibilities, and I just think he's like amazing. And I'm just a huge fan of how Kind of twisted he is, but also honest he is. Um and this film kind of w is COVID in some ways, or more specifically, what it felt like to experience America in particular, but also the world at large and how truth is perceived, by just looking at your phone and like doom scrolling and reading about What is going on and the different responses to that? Um, the performative responses to that, the sincere responses to that, the the feeling that like the sort of partisan divide in, you know, the likes of the UK and the US was just widened by everything that happened during COVID, from masks to You know, just the poison people were reading on their phones every day, and then just the feeling that we were stuck indoors and that we might die and that we're all going completely mad. And this film is sort of like sort of captures that, but it I think it does it slightly too soon after COVID nineteen for anyone to really want to engage with it or Bingo. Or appreciate it. And I think that maybe we need about 20 years between now and COVID for that for it there to be a little bit more like we're ready to reflect on this and understand it a bit more. Um, but it still kind of feels like we're living in uh the sort of you know, the aftershock of COVID in so many different ways. Um, for example, I work in the video games industry and um the the effects of COVID. Um but COVID is kind of responsible in some ways for all the layoffs that have happened the last few years because of the rapid expansion that happened with all the new investment coming in off the back of um COVID and people being stuck indoors. Um patterns of people playing games that can never be replicated and a massive uh sort of like war for talent across different studios, then the contraction afterwards when They realize all those short-term gains weren't gonna last forever and so it's time to take it out on the employees. Um so that's just like that's just my experience of professional experience of COVID, but they're obviously all these other bits of it that we're living through. Um this film just taps into the the divide there but I think um if you try and detach it from that context, what you really have is like And I think it is kind of impossible to do that. It is a bit about the sort of like the escalation between these two political forces in this town and the fact that this sheriff played by Joaquin Phoenix cannot put the cannot put his personal life to one side and do his job properly. And so that just starts to poison every aspect of his life. um his home life and how he interacts with um his partner played by Emma Stone and um her her mother and um yes Pedro Pascal who is this mayor all hopeful who is uh a bit A bit suave, but also not a bad guy. Um he's a bit too slick, but and maybe a little bit vapid, but he's not the worst guy in the world necessarily. And um yeah, the way that kind of just like The way the temperature has just turned up in this film um is is a bit i it's like it makes it a challenging watch, but it also makes it really exciting. And there are some really like amazing surprises in this film and wicked set pieces like that when the action kicks off it's actually really really good And uh yeah, it's sort of a Western that tries to get its arms around everything that's happened to uh to to truth and how we live with other people in the modern world, really. And um I love that about it, but I totally recognise it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. Long-winded, Matthew, but that's that's Eddington. Thoughts?

Matthew
01:16:16
We haven't talked about it, so I'm I'm glad to hear your thoughts in full. I mean, you know, m m my very basic take and cheap get out clause, you know, is that I am, you know, very much of the you know, of the thinking that uh you know, I don't particularly want to to to not just wallow in the COVID stuff, but the bigger culture war stuff. I I f I feel like Cleverly showing that or representing that on film doesn't really help me much. I'm like, yeah, I know. It sucks. You know, this the modern age really, really sucks. And it does look like that and it does feel like that. But i I don't really know w if he what he's actually saying about that. um get worse. And, you know, we're so entrenched in them, you know, it's impossible to view this film, you know, without your own personal bias coming into it. And it focusing on Whacking Phoenix who is presented as a bit of a he's a little bit of a sort of anti-mask guy, but for for a medical reason. You know he's he's like asthmatic and so he doesn't want to wear a mask. But It instantly gets my back up to see that character saying those things a as a protagonist, I found him very, very hard to spend time with. 'cause I'm like, uh fuck this guy. You know, like I w I hope something awful happens to this guy. Because you know, we're all victims of the same you know, we're all part of this. We're a part of this this situation that it's showing. So I don't know, I haven't scored it on letterbox yet. I just don't really know how I feel about it. Um Yeah, I think it's a good idea. I just don't think about Venn diagram of our tastes, I I think Ariaster is So on the opposite side. He's like he's like the little sliver of us that that isn't if not aligned, at least that we can kind of comprehend where the other person's coming from. Where I'm like after this and Bo is afraid like I don't really want to see anything else he does. I just I'm so out on this guy being like here's all the fucked up horrible stuff. Bye and I'm like what?

Samuel
01:18:31
You can't do that, you know Can I uh so I kind of get having that reaction to Bo is afraid, but can I at least ask on the thing of you saying I know about culture wars and all that stuff? Does it not make you feel a little bit more reassured to see someone b distill the truth into something the way this does? And the way bit the various ways people behave in the modern age and why they do it, whether it's performative or sincere or they're deluded or wherever it is, just someone to go. Look over there, that is what reality is. I've put it in a film. Does that do you not think that has some value even if you don't like what it's showing you?

Matthew
01:19:13
Yeah, I no, I I do get that.

Samuel
01:19:16
But it si but it really does have no stance on it. Do you think so? I think it's quite a I think it's quite it's like a biting film, but I do think that clearly a liberal it's clearly liberal sensibilities behind it. It's clearly people who think Uh clearly someone who thinks Whacking Phoenix is insane. Like clearly.

Matthew
01:19:33
Yeah.

Samuel
01:19:34
But he is also a guy who says basically says white people will be performative in caring about what happens to black people and they they're just doing it to for virtue signalling reasons. It's a film that does both those things. There's like no one to root for in this film.

Matthew
01:19:52
No, I suppose not. Like ever like if you were in this film, you know, th there is some you know, you are do you know you are doing something wrong all these characters you know uh you know maybe different degrees of wrong but I I just I found that so sort of alienating to watch I'm like Well I don't know what I'm to take away from this other than yeah, I recognise all that and it's well observed and you know, p i it's it's m maybe a bit more daring to um take some shots at sort of performative uh progressives, you know, which is a more unlikely thing to see in in media But I st I'm still aware or aware of that stuff.

Samuel
01:20:34
And they're not his primary target either.

Matthew
01:20:36
He sort of like he turns us target.

Samuel
01:20:41
That's kind of what the film does. Um Yeah, it's uh uh f I it's not an easy watch.

Matthew
01:20:47
But the only guy who kind of is fine is is the slightly deranged hobo. Yeah. But then the um I don't think like Well you just have no awareness of what's going on around you and you just stumble through life being like chaotic and unpleasant, but not like particularly malign.

Samuel
01:21:02
Yeah, that is true. Um Pedro Pascal's not that bad. Like he's slimy, but he's not like oh wait, no, he doesn't he have a sexual assault thing in his history. That's the thing, isn't it? I'm trying to remember now what the the thing is that he reads on the um Yes, okay, okay, you're right, that is just homeless man. There is no one else. Uh yeah, it's definitely in the same bucket as like Threads, speak no evil, red rooms. Like, it's in the curse bucket. Yes, you're right, there's no one to root root for, and the conclusion will not make you feel any better about mankind, but There's something existentially thrilling about watching it nonetheless. That's how I felt about Addington.

Matthew
01:21:41
I recognise that art doesn't need to have someone to root for, you know. I'm not I'm not so basic to be like, because of that, it is bad. I'm just saying that from my personal tastes and sensibilities, uh I found this incredibly hard work. But I'm also like I can I know why you like it. I think I get it.

Samuel
01:21:58
Do you you must be a bit like You must be so sick of me at this point with like hit Sammy Roberts and his bullshit cursed things that he enjoys. It's kind of predictable that I would like this and you wouldn't, I think, in some ways, but I did wonder what you might think of me liking this when you watched it. Like of course he fucking likes this, you know? Um Yeah, um, but that's okay. Um yeah, Eddington, I mean I I could probably do a whole hour long podcast on this film with Matthew. I I found it there's a that's without even really getting into any of the actual like filmmaking side of it, which I think is really accomplished. And to your Ariaster point, I don't think he'll get to make another film like this and Bo is afraid again. They've both flopped. Like he's gonna have to make a conventional horror thing to get a film made next time. It just you can't you can't keep doing he's had his two vanity projects, that's it now. Like it's not That's not the era of film we're in, unfortunately. But um yeah. Um but hey, um I I think in maybe in ten, fifteen years this might be a bit of a cult classic, you know? Um He should make a saw film. I think it's good. Get him on the straight and narrow. Just make one saw film. I think this'll be some show the world you still got the stuff. I think this will have a similar reputation in ten to fifteen years of something like they live where it's a bit, you know, in its time, maybe not massively like appreciated, but over time is observing something that was that was real in that moment that is a A fundamental truth that speaks over.

Matthew
01:23:24
For me, it was on and I I I'm s I'm sorry to do this to you, it was verging on Southland tales for me.

Samuel
01:23:32
That's okay. That's alright. You don't have to like it, Matthew. Um but again, I'm excited to see your two-star review go live on Letterboxd, so that'll be your that'll be good. What's your number one? Mine number one is, boringly, one battle after another. Well, it's a very well-made film, so fair enough.

Matthew
01:23:47
Well, I I know that you're slightly cooler on it than than some, uh, and It's it you know, as with so many good things this year, uh you have to detach it from some elements of the fan base. But, you know, I don't think I I don't think we're joining some bandwagon here by liking a Paul Thomas Anderson film, a director who's Work I've mostly absolutely adored. I just thought this was slightly different mode. If you haven't seen it, it's about Leonardo Leonardo DiCaprio plays a sort of uh an aging member of, you know, what was almost like a sort of guerrilla warfare group who uh at one point were uh setting people uh free from US sort of internment camps and uh it joins him fifteen or so years later where he's got a teenage daughter that that he had with one of his fellow revolutionaries and they're living a kind of quiet life in the middle of nowhere and for various plot contrivances, a uh sort of deranged general played by Sean Penn uh comes after his daughter and Leonardo DiCaprio has to sort of get his act together and tap back into his warrior mindset from his past and work with a now aging network of these revolutionaries to try and get his daughter back. I think it's probably like a succinct way of describing it. I've seen some people describe this as, you know, if Paul Thomas Anderson did an action film, which isn't quite true. It's definitely a thriller. It's definitely really exciting. Has one of the most i exciting third acts of a film I've seen this year, which is probably the reason it's so high for me. I just I love the the craft and you know being on the edge of my seat in the cinema is always going to sort of entertain me and and win me over. And I didn't really get it from Mission Impossible this year, which should have been the one. Um but weirdly this much smaller tale of you know basically three different people driving around the desert in cars uh I found really exciting. I just I thought it was really funny, uh in an i it just great performances. I thought Sean Penn was absolutely brilliant. Like he's a total bizarro caricature, but he sort of fully commits to it and like the hardest I've laughed at a film this year was is just watching him sort of grimace and strain his jaw. Uh I love the weird sort of secret Nazi cult that he's working for. I think Leo DiCaprio and he's a weird character in that he's so totally hopeless that he isn't really the dr you know, he's the main focus of the film, but he doesn't really drive any of the action because he's just sort of there being useless. But I you know I thought he sold that pretty well. Maybe it is a film where I I kind of prefer the performances around him. Um Chase Infinity plays his daughters, excellent. Benichi De Toro plays this karate instructor who also helps sub smuggle sort of immigrants in and out of the country. To see a film which has big ideas dealing with, you know, big political themes of the day, but also functions purely as a very entertaining thriller with really clear stakes, great villains, exciting action. You know, maybe I am connecting with this on a on a slightly more basic level and it is my sort of love of genre and hunger for that which elevates this so high in the list, but I just I thought the the balance of plot mechanics and getting the thing moving and what it was saying about, you know, the current moment. Uh just really, really well judged. Yeah, just an and and also like it's a long ass film, but it moves so fast. I I thought this was Just a yeah, a brilliant time at the cinema.

Samuel
01:27:37
Yeah, it it really um it definitely is that. I really appreciate how well made it was, how well acted across the board it was. Um I think that it that that side of it definitely energized me more than the the subject matter, um which is relevant to our modern world, but also isn't like hugely revelatory in anything it has to to really say about any of that. And I think that's where I think maybe the absolute tidal wave of hype that came from the Filmbro side of things with this film is Uh maybe where I bristled at it slightly because I did appreciate how well made it was and I think you can depend on Paul Thomas Anderson for that, even if this is made at a scale. um at which he's never remade a movie before, um and he hasn't made a movie in this particular um genre before in this exact way. Um you know that that ended up being the part that was more exciting to me and You know, the performances that were outstanding, you know, I think Sean Penn is a is a fair call, but I actually thought Bedishel Doltoro was Quietly brilliant. You know, it's like um it's a very real character he inhabits, but it's never as splashy as the Sean Penn role, which is the the obvious Oscar front runner for that's in that supporting actor category. But like it but he is also I think quite a lot hinges on Del Toro to give the world some that DiCaprio is inhabiting, some substance and some truth to it. And I think he's really good at balancing that plus it's just a great hang, you know, which is also um also important. And um I absolutely loved uh Tiana Taylor in the opening act of this film. Um the prologue like Such a good performance that it almost overpowered the rest of the film for me. I was blown away by her. I I if she doesn't win best supporting actress, that is a travesty. I think that is the best performance in this film personally. Um but yeah in general I thought it was really good. I mean it's my number it's my number five. I didn't I didn't I didn't not like it. I really liked it. I um yeah, it was it was it felt kinda like a like a seventies film in some ways. Um in terms of like the ti you know, what the what the story was about and Oh you know it's psych it's nice to see a director like this being given loads of money to spend on something and even if it doesn't make a billion dollars like Loads of people saw it, loads of people celebrated it. It seems like it was pretty good for film that this happened this year. Um yeah, it was a great time in the cinema. So um yeah, I uh I I I agree I agree ultimately Matthew. Um it's only a few places difference, you know. Hmm. Okay. Well then my number one is The Secret Agent, which was your number two. It's uh nice we both got this so high. I mean it's a great film and um I was just reading a slate piece today that said that this is It's like considered a bit of a dark horse Oscar contender. And uh it it it really is like fantastic. Um I don't think this is widely available in the UK yet. I think it might be January or February this comes out. So we'll definitely keep uh details of this um you know, fairly fairly lean, just so you can go discover it for yourself. But uh it's about a technology expert played by uh Wagner Mora who goes back to his hometown in nineteen seventy seven. Um it's a set during the Uh during um uh a t a tumultuous time um for Brazil, uh where uh basically like corruption um is rife and political enemies are are hunted down by the police. It's uh You know, it's uh uh it's recent history really, but it's um a pretty dangerous and I guess like exciting backdrop for the kind of s political thriller, I guess you would say this is. Um and he basically this this guy is trying to reunite with his uh young son and flee the country um while evading hitmen who are trying to who are basically closing in on him. So he he's trying to come back be incognito basically and um and uh yeah just uh while time is ticking down until he till he gets to leave this place. And It's a really effective period piece. It makes the the world around this guy feel dangerous. It's the uh corruption is so rife that it just there's a absolutely fantastic um scene at the very start with a gas station and a dead body and some corrupt cops who turn up. Um that is perfect to setting the scene. Um but even though the the context is really serious. Uh it's a ver it's a pretty stylish film. It's got a few it does a uh has got a few different storytelling devices that I just did not expect and really elevated it for me. Um what could have been like kind of a typical bit of Oscar fair. It's not that. Um and I really uh I really think that people who like this podcast and like the kind of media that myself and Matthew talk about, like I think we'll we'll really appreciate it too. I wouldn't say much more than that. Wagnemor is amazing in it as well. I actually would probably give him Best Actor over Leo or Chalamet in um Mighty Supreme. I think it's like a really understated performance, but This you can just see all the personal history that he's carrying around, um, from yeah, trying to trying to exist in a country uh when he's got um all of the when he's got political enemies. Um yeah, it's great stuff, Matthew Thoughts.

Matthew
01:32:50
Yeah, I I I absolutely love this. I actually think it's a really good companion piece in a way to one battle after another in that it does function as an entertaining thriller with like some quite good villains. You know, you get to spend some time with the villains and understand what they're up to. It's a it's a lot more like grounded. There's nothing sort of fantastical about this. Like it's a a lot more of a sort of feels anyway like a realistic depiction of this country in this era and you get to spend a lot of time with like normal people who don't feel like outlandish film characters. And that almost makes it all the more exciting when you do get these slightly more kind of caricatured or kind of edgy, kind of, you know, the the corrupt policeman or some assassins that they hire when they come into the mix. you know, you're like, well how are these two kind of ingredients gonna kind of collide and mix together and um yeah, it's it but it w way more subtle, but another film about a yeah, a kind of dad who's not really equipped for a particular situation, dealing with the situation but uh uh yeah really really good. It's a it's a really close run thing between this and one battle for me. Um you know I I I like them. equally, um, both very fast moving despite being very long. Um just yeah, great. Greats of genre films with much bigger ideas.

Samuel
01:34:20
Yeah, I think uh I think listeners will love it when they get a chance to watch it. So um Yeah, please do check it out. That'd be good. Okay, Matthew. Um, well, I guess before we take a quick break and come back with TV shows, two super quick extra things I wanted to chuck in here. Um I did say at the start of this year that I wasn't gonna watch TV shows this year. I was gonna w watch loads of old films and make you a ranking of those. And In the end, I did decide to watch enough TV to be able to contribute to that conversation. So you weren't doing all of the heavy lifting yourself. But I did did also make a quick top ten of the old movies I watched this year. Um there's no shortage of them. Um so uh I'll just kind of run through those very briefly. Um number 10 uh is Nashville, Robert Altman film. about the um about the music festival, which is basically one of his uh canvas of loads of different characters kind of interacting to sort of capture a moment basically. Um like Christopher Guest films without jokes. That's a really like basic way of putting it.

Matthew
01:35:19
That's a that's absolutely perfect description of Robert Altman's body of work.

Samuel
01:35:23
But there is a little bit of that to it, isn't it, where Everyone's got their own personal story they're bringing to this and there is like a wider story that a w uh you know, like a a wider event that's bringing them all together. Um but captures what was, yeah, like quite uh what seemed at the time like a very A very it was like a a rough decade for the US basically that it captures that moment very well and with some amazing performance. So I'd never seen it. I went and saw it on the big screen and that was a great use of a Sunday morning. Um so wanted to shout that out Shout out to a film that's about 50 years old. Number nine, I've put uh Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice, which I'd never seen, um, but saw this year, 2005. um with Kira Knightley. Quite an interesting film in the sense that it's become a bit I think at the time people complained because they like that TV show with Colin Firth. who I think is a very very boring actor, um not interesting at all. Um Um this with Kira Knightley and Matthew um McF McFadden, McFadden, however you say that, um actually like really, really good. Like it's quite a dreamily shot and presented film. I don't know that much about Joe Wright's work, um, but uh it seems like people really like this and atonement as as a

Matthew
01:36:32
a sort of pair and um it's got a good uh good little Tom Holland uh bit in it.

Samuel
01:36:37
Yeah it does. It's got a um a a great turn from Donald Sutherland as well as the dad in it. Like it should be sh that feels like an element of the film that shouldn't work, but it does. Rosamond Pike's in it as well. Um it's a bit of a Netflix or BBCI player staple, this one, but I was I was pretty impressed by it to be honest. Um Um put Snowpiercer at eight, Matthew. This is a really random list I realise as we go.

Matthew
01:37:03
Finally, Nashville Prime Copters and Snow Piercer together at last. Uh yeah, so that as a Blu-ray trilogy box set.

Samuel
01:37:11
Yeah, a really naffly put together DVD box that you get at Astor in like 2005 for about five quid. Um yeah, watch this as part of the um uh the the the episode we did early this year. Um and it was really like uh I I I think I s I was kinda alternating between this as an Okja for this slot actually because those are both films I really loved. um that we kind of that we watched for that episode. But um yeah, I think this is a bit of like, you know, sci-fi original feeling sci-fi um is is why it sort of stood out a little bit and It being one of the few good Chris Evans performances. There are there are fewer than five, so you have to treasure them when you get them. So um there it is. Um and now we transition to Michael Mann's thief, Matthew. at number seven. Um a film I'd not seen before this year, a very strange film, um, about a man who is um allegedly a very good thief, but you only get to see him do it twice in the film. It's a bit of a that's like the one bummer about thief, but If you like shots of um needs more theme. It does. I think it does. I think it could use one more set piece somewhere in the second or third act just to really bring it to life. Um but it's basically um James Carn being uh being mean to a woman um for for like a load of the film and some great shots of cars.

Matthew
01:38:30
Now I understand why you like it.

Samuel
01:38:32
And then some great shots of um of of like cars uh driving over like uh puddly, kind of rainy streets to m to make the lights look uh look a bit more enhanced. Um yeah, it's it's not like the best Michael Mann film, but it's um it's a pretty cool film. Like it's a key 80s text. It obviously is important to um yeah to To people for uh for that reason. Like it's one of the the things that sort of set the agenda um for the aesthetic of the 80s, which Michael Mann between this and you know, Manhunter and um Uh Miami Vice is very much responsible for, so was well worth a watch. Um now another turn uh to the Wicker Man at number six, Matthew Um a film I'd never seen, but thought I'll finally sit down and watch it. Obviously I know how it ends, but um it is really, really entertaining this film. Um and just um I would say that Edward Woodward shouting CRIEST at the end is something that I've um started doing in real life. Um much to the uh Chagrin of my partner, so that's um that happened this year. Um but a really I like a great film, like really as good as everyone said it was. Um It's not just a film that like boring British people say is good and uh turns out not to be. It's not Doctor Who, is what I'm saying. Like it is good. Um so look at this. Get a little bonus drive by Dr. Who in there. Uh trade spotting, um number five, never seen this before. Uh absolutely electrifying watch. Um Watch this and Shadow Grave back to back actually, Matthew. That was um that was good when I was having a bit of a boil um marathon um off the back of twenty-eight years later. Um the French Connection, number four, um just you know really muscular Gene Hackman performance, great car chase, an all-time classic, had never seen it, um really good. Second one, pretty pretty mediocre to be honest, but Has a couple of good moments in it, otherwise not really worth watching. Um Holland Drive. I'd seen big chunks of this film, but never all of it all the way through. Um but obviously very unsettling and uh yeah, it was Kind of in that I imagine a lot of people off the back of the death of David Lynch were digging into his back catalogue, and I thought it was time I finally sat down and watched this and

Matthew
01:40:38
This is a this is of course the year that I went to see the Stranger Things play and sat opposite the guy who walks behind the diner in Moult Holland Drive. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

Samuel
01:40:48
Um Patrick Watson Patrick Fischler, is that his name? I think it's similar.

Matthew
01:40:52
Yeah.

Samuel
01:40:53
That's an all-timer sequence. It really distracted me all the way through Stranger Things.

Matthew
01:40:57
I was like, should I talk to him?

Samuel
01:40:58
Should I say hello? Well he's obviously he obviously he's a madman as well, right? Jimmy Barrett. He's got what all-time a face he's got. A face that's been it was also immortalized in Ellie Noir, where he played Mickey Cohen, so uh yeah. Um Michael Clayton is my number two, Matthew. Um I watched this off the back of one of the TV shows we're going to discuss shortly. Um fairly self-evident which one that would be. And uh number one is the Francis Walker Purda film The Conversation and other Gene Hackman performance hadn't seen that film before. But uh yeah, bit of an education this year. So I thought I'd just, you know, pass a bit of comment on that. And uh Thought I'd wrap up this section, Matthew, by asking if you had any books from this year you wanted to recommend.

Matthew
01:41:35
I was mostly catching up with sort of older stuff. Uh something I read over the Christmas holiday, so it's present in my mind at the moment. is uh The Clock House Murders um by Ayetsuji. He's the author who wrote the Deccan House Murders. He's written a series of of Japanese locked room mysteries that are all based around I think it's called the Bizarre House series because each one is about a a weird house and this one's about a house full of clocks. um which I very much enjoyed but any any of his stuff is is decent. This year I also I've been doing this book subscription with Mr. B's a bookshop in Bath and they've been sending me basically non-Japanese crime fiction is what I asked for, and I've enjoyed everything I've read through that. So this isn't a 2025 book, but I recently read a book called Titanium Noir. by Nick Harkaway, who's John LeCarrie's son. It's like a sci-fi sort of gumshoe story, very sort of private eye, very, you know, Chandler sort of you know, inspired sort of detective story. Um, but set in a a future where there is a drug which basically lets the very rich people kind of sort of de-age themselves or restart their their kind of youth to kind of heal up. But the side effect of this is that they go through puberty again, so they grow again, and so every time they do it, they get bigger and bigger, and it's created this subset of society. of like these sort of giant immortal people. Right. And i it's about a detective dealing with these big, big bastards. Very backpage coded, I would say. Oh, it's great. I mean uh yeah, it's it just really caught my imagination the idea that there is a society where the richest people are just literally four times bigger than everyone. And He just sort of describes them sort of like he gets attacked at one point when someone just like shouts in his ear using their giant Titan mouth. Um yeah. I I like that a lot.

Samuel
01:43:42
Wow, interesting. Okay.

Matthew
01:43:43
Cool. So two two book recommendations, both quite quick quick and easy reads.

Samuel
01:43:48
Well, good stuff, Matthew. I think that'll be uh I everyone likes to hear, I think, what you've uh you've been up to on the reading side. So um I'll be sure to check it every now and then just to to get a catch-up. Thanks for throwing throwing me a book bone. Of course, yeah, I didn't expect to hear about. uh giant people um being investigated. I' That was uh but come to think of it that in many ways that's the most Matthew Castle thing you could have read. So um yeah. Okay, um let's take a quick break then Matthew and we'll come back and talk about TV. Welcome back to the podcast. Films are done. It's time to move on to TV. Matthew, was it a good year for TV?

Matthew
01:44:26
I I I actually looking back on it, I know I messaged you before this and was like, eh, it was a pretty average year for TV. I I don't think it was Stellar, but I I actually watched loads of stuff that I liked. Like I probably watched thirty different series this year. Yeah. That seems to be missing from like all mediums this year. But I I don't know why that is. I don't know if it's just because of all the the sort of moving and shaking that's going on in terms of like ownership of the of the big T V makers. I feel like HBO hasn't had like a proper sort of five star gem for a while, feel like a lot of the streaming services are relying very heavily on like nostalgia of previous series or very safe bets of like creators who are just churning out the same thing. So I don't really know what the next layer of five star TV shows are, you know, I'm not really anticipating anything at the moment, but I'm watching loads of stuff and it's f it's fine.

Samuel
01:45:30
Yeah, I didn't massively engage with TV this year. Um four of my shows I've watched in the last week, basically, um, for this list. Um, which was actually quite a nice way to catch up. But once I did that I only really felt like I was two or three shows away from being completely caught up. Um it just doesn't seem like there's a a wealth of outstanding stuff out there. Um I mean I I'm there's at least a couple of British shows I'm curious to hear your takes on. I think they'll come up in this in your list. Um but otherwise, yeah, I think that it feels like it on the US side, I d I think they're just in a real like funk to be honest. Because yes, Warner Brothers gets fucking passed around. nonstop um by like telephone companies and and like uh just are there c companies that should not be allowed to own um like a film company basically And uh it's um yeah, it's a bummer because HBO's kind of been kidnapped a little bit by IP, so there's like an IT prequel this year. Uh I heard it was alright.

Matthew
01:46:31
I I watched about half an hour of that. I thought that was absolute garbage.

Samuel
01:46:35
What a f I mean, but that's real such a waste of HBO dollar. They used to make succession. What are you doing? Um they're making a Green Lantern show. I mean, I'd like the character Green Lantern, but I would rather have uh like a proper HBO drama, you know, of the likes of Sopranos and Deadwood than More DC content. The Last of Us, which the second season everyone said The Last of Us was terrible. Um and uh uh Peacemaker, sure I've not watched. I know people do quite like that one. Um but uh I again I would trade all of these just for some decent TV. Um but like it's ah god, it's a real bummer. Um and yeah, places that used to make good TV don't anymore. Um so it's Yeah, there's not even really been like an outstanding FFFX show this year when I saw Alien Earth popping up on people's top ten lists. I was like fucking hell, how bad was this year? I watched two episodes of that and it was rubbish. So Man! Yeah, I'm a bit down on TV, but um I did watch some good stuff this past week, and um I there's a few things I'm optimistic about next year as well. Uh I've not seen this show The Lowdown yet, Matthew, that people say is good with Ethan Hall. Yeah, I've not seen that yet. That's on Disney Plus. That just launched on Disney Plus, so I'll be checking that out. Um but let's get into our top tens and see what uh see what came up. What's your number 10?

Matthew
01:47:49
My so my number 10, it is a it was a bit of a tie between Death by Lightning, which was the Netflix mini-series about the assassination of President Garfield and the very different uh Dexter Resurrection. I've actually opted for Dexter Resurrection Uh I really like Death by Lightning. Great show. Good turns from Michael Shannon, Matthew McFadden, um lots of excellent facial hair. do give it a watch, but I think Dexter Resurrection I I didn't think there would ever be another truly good season of Dexter again. You know, it's it's one of the most uneven series, you know, uneven shows there's ever been in terms of quality. Uh and yeah, the idea of him going to New York and facing off against an evil uh Peter Dinklage didn't necessarily have the sort of hallmarks of great TV, but Uh uh somehow they did it. I I you know, I I don't think it was as good as Peak Dexter has been, but uh I thought the decision to have him facing off against a sort of secret society of serial killers who'd been brought together by Peter Dinklage meant that every couple of episodes he was facing off against a really fun guest star. Um so like uh is it Kristen Ritter? Yeah, Jessica Jones back in the day. Was she Jessica Jones? Kajima Emoji. Yeah, she she's one of them. Um that guy whose surname I can never remember uh David Dalm Dalmachin.

Samuel
01:49:25
Oh the guy from um Late Night with the Devil, that guy.

Matthew
01:49:28
Yeah, he's one of them. Um and and some others I won't spoil and it it just felt like Y normally you get one guest star as like the baddie that he's doing the cat and mouse thing with, but I really liked seeing him facing off with like five bastards over the course of, you know, ten quite kind of tightly potted episodes. It was pretty shallow, you know. I'm not gonna pretend Dexter is like higher or anything, but you know, as someone who has watched, you know, every single iteration of that show, for better or worse, I thought this was like Upper tier.

Samuel
01:50:01
Yeah, that's um that is fair enough, uh Matthew. I um I uh I've never really participated in the whole Dexter thing, but I was I'm pleased that your commitment to it has paid off. Um because yeah, I did they did manage to turn this into a bit of a moment this year, and I know that it was a an uphill struggle to turn around sentiment on that on that whole show. So um Good stuff.

Matthew
01:50:23
Yeah.

Samuel
01:50:24
Yeah.

Matthew
01:50:24
I mean he literally had died, that character. Like they'd properly killed him off uh thus resurrection. Like he just came back from the dead.

Samuel
01:50:34
Amazing. Um fair enough. Okay, um my number ten is a T T V show I did not like, Matthew. Um so I will say my it gets a bit firmer mind from eight upwards. But this is basically the stuff I watched this year. Um but I did think this is worth talking about. I've put the bear season four here Matthew. Okay. Which is a season of TV I did not like and struggled to get through because I think all the tension has been taken out of this show and it is now basically a kind of like Therapy speak, look out Jukebox, look out all the all these cool music I got FX to pay for. Um and sort of like uh people being nice to each other show and it's uh some people might see that as a nice antidote to what the show was when it first started, which was a A kind of like a powder keg of toxic people being mean to each other in a kitchen and the stress of cooking. Um but now it's like so devoid of tension that I don't actually think it functions. as a TV show anymore. Uh there was an episode where all the characters get under a table with a kid in there I thought was like the worst hour of anything I've sat through this year so bad. Um yeah, some and somehow there are still more facts, like procedurally generated facts. They just keep fucking at least there's no John Cena this season, but Oh god. Yeah, I don't like the show anymore, unfortunately. And just two years ago I absolutely loved it, but it happens, you know, it happens for TV. So um yeah, thoughts, Matthew?

Matthew
01:52:05
Uh I just I don't think it could survive the scrutiny of being a sort of phenomenon in the modern age, you know, mean to death, done to death. Trying to sort of second guess what people would like. Um, you know, ironically, just messed up its own recipe and started giving you too much of of you know Second season was so well balanced and uh just trying to kind of repeat successful beats from that show without uh but but sort of to a lesser effect over and over again. Um it's still like It's still watchable, but it's uh a a pretty disappointing show for me now. Yeah, I think that's fair. What's your number nine, Matthew? My number nine is White Lotus season three. Ah yeah, I've not got to this yet. I I did like this. I feel like lots of people turned on this season because the last episode is is a bit of a duffer and doesn't end in like a particularly satisfying way for some characters who feel like they've gone on some quite nuanced journeys and then it suddenly gets very rushed and very hectic at the end. It is it is definitely an unbalanced season compared to the previous ones. Um I think it has some of the weakest turns that there's been. I I did not like uh Jason Isaac's in this show. And he was such a big presence and he was so one note as this dad going through a kind of crisis and secretly wolfing down his wife's sort of anxiety pills and meds so that he was sort of constantly sort of drugged out. I mean there were like, you know, mild spoilers, sort of It felt like four or five very long scenes where he contemplated killing himself, which is which is just too many versions of that moment. And it was it was annoying because I felt like some of the other characters were absolutely brilliant. I thought Patrick Schwarzenegger was like an all-time brilliant bit of White Lotus casting, like just a classic handsome actor you maybe don't rate who ends up being like super weird and super menacing and has to do some really strange shit and really sells the hell out of it. Definitely one of the MVPs of this season. Uh I really like Walton Goggins and Amy Lou uh what's her name? Amy Lou Wood. Yes, but th the end of their story is just that they're they're the problematic ones in the final really. I don't know, I'd say even a very uneven White Lotus is still better than like most TV shows. But I am pleased to hear that I think the season four they're they're going back to the sort of a a French hotel. I think the Thailand of it all got a little distracting in this and m maybe tried to sort of stretch out what the show was a little too much where really you just want like a load of assholes in like a nice little hotel. Hopefully it can sort of find its footing again.

Samuel
01:54:55
So I watched two episodes of this. And I thought that the characters were like a r massive mixed bag. They did some just did not it actually felt like watching someone write a reality TV show more than like watch someone re write a drama. Like the way they were all introduced was they are all on the boat. And like it was basically like, please introduce what kind what archetypes you are in as obvious a fashion as possible. And then immediately bristling at Jason Isaac's accent And um what's who's who plays his wife again, Matthew? Just a Posey, an actress I really like, but th they're just they're just so cartoonish, I was like, wow, just I I I don't I don't think you work in this show at all.

Matthew
01:55:42
Um no, she's completely the wrong person for it. Like just too much of her caricature, you know?

Samuel
01:55:48
Yeah, for sure. Um I did quite like the the wine girlies, um which count um Michelle Monaghan and um Carrie Kuhn among them. I will watch the rest of this, but it did feel the most of like I'm artificially creating some drama here. Um of the different seasons he's done um in what I watched and I was just a bit like, ah, that was despite there being some clear standouts in the cast. I always enjoy Morton Goggins. I like Amy Lee Wood. Um yeah, it's um But you know, I think he's allowed one one bust of a season. And like you say, already moving ahead with the next one, Helena Bonham Carter rumoured to be in the cast. So that's um That's exciting and uh yeah. I don't know about her in that.

Matthew
01:56:27
Oh really?

Samuel
01:56:28
Okay, interesting.

Matthew
01:56:29
But I think she might be like Jason Isaacs, a bit too big, a bit like bigger actor for it.

Samuel
01:56:34
Uh yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe just uh You just need it a bit more bit more subtlety in it. You might be right, actually. That might not work. Yeah, I could kind of see that. Okay, interesting. Um, all right, Matthew. Um my n my number nine is girl bands forever um documentary on the BBC. Um the sequel documentary to Boy Bands Forever last year, which I very much enjoyed. I think I did talk about the podcast a little bit. Don't think I put in my top ten shows of that year even though it Definitely was like it was really really good and um yeah this this season interesting because I think that that that show Boybounds forever was a huge success for the BBC so they immediately made a sequel but I think that the It's it creates so many headlines for the featuring the different acts and all the different talking heads that some a bunch of girlbands were just like no we're not even doing it. So You don't get um some of the biggest of the of their different eras in this. You don't get any Spice Girls, for example. Uh you don't get any girls allowed. Um, which is a slight bummer. They also start the girl band thing a little bit later than when it arguably did start, so it kind of kicks off from the 90s onwards, so you don't get any of um like banana rama or whatever. So it's a little bit it's very millennial coded. But it does still have some like good stories.

Matthew
01:57:48
Enough banana rama talking heads is the weirdest criticism I've heard in this episode so far.

Samuel
01:57:53
Yeah, we've gone from Eddington um to this somehow, but um you know, uh You contain multitudes. I s I sure do, pal. And uh yeah, this um There's like the highlights of this were they got um uh Mel Blatt, who is one of the All Saints, to basically bitch about the Spice Girls. And they were kinda like the slightly cooler girl band alternative to um Spice Girls, even though they were like massively popular, they had they their music was a bit better. And yeah, so um that was that was good because um Mel Blat is um an incredibly charming woman And um that uh that kind of like 15 minute stretch of this show is really, really good. I think it's three episodes in total. Um there's a good bit on um The girl band Mystique, do you do you know this band, Matthew? Um they were like written.

Matthew
01:58:41
I know the name, I c I don't think I get how many of their tunes.

Samuel
01:58:43
Yeah, they were kind of like uh a sort of like garage uh infused kind of girl band and um They've got a song in GTA Phi, which I think is why I thought you might know know who they were. Um and they basically got scammed out of um making any money from their music, which is a real bummer to hear about. But you get a few stories like that in this Um and then they got a bunch of the DLC sugar babes as well. So Sugar Babes is like a you may be familiar with this, but it's a bit of a ship of Theseus girl band. Yes. Uh and so they got two of the DLC sugar babies for this to talk about that whole process and like coming in and Having to be the replacements and how at first it was fine because after the first one left and Heidi the replacement came in Um it was like that was their most successful era, but then as the they replaced bits of the ship further um it just became it fell apart basically.

Matthew
01:59:33
And so Was there ever a time where the sugar babes were three all-new sugar babes?

Samuel
01:59:38
Yes, that was the very last item. They released one album that everyone hated and sold no copies, and then that was the end of it basically.

Matthew
01:59:45
So the longest serving sugar babe.

Samuel
01:59:47
Uh I think it was Uh it's either I think it might have been Keisha. Uh I can't actually remember because it extends anything that happened in music. After 2007, when I was no longer working in OneStop, listening to Radio One, I just I have no knowledge of what occurred, and that's when basically the the sugar babes thing kind of like fell apart. Um yeah.

Matthew
02:00:12
It's just like how you know how in an RPG party you end up with the character you've had the longest from the start and they're so overleveled you can basically never get rid of them. I just want to know who in the sugar babes is that character.

Well the thing is that I would say that the the original three girls have such like distinctive voices that I think when you lost one it was fine. Um and you lose two and you like you lose two and you're like, okay, well they still you know, they're still um amazing vocal talents. But you lose all three and then it absolutely does not sound like the same thing anymore. Uh yeah, so okay, right. I'm not saying that this is necessarily like um something that back Page listers might enjoy, a few might enjoy, but a very Moorish documentary. I mean I think I recommend recommended this last year too, but Boy Bands Forever, This and and the Loaded documentary that's on iPlayer. That's a really good like A bunch of millennial content for you to Especially if you're an international listener and you want to understand UK culture a bit. Well, some of these fans were big abroad, that's a thing. Um they have atomic kit in here. Atomic kit in Wershite, that's a thing. Um, but they have some interesting stories as well. It's just the thing of like, this would have been Uh probably higher on my list if they'd have got more of the actual the key bands at the time. Or like a or or a or a genuine sugar babe, like the Version 1. 0 sugar babe as opposed to the yeah, did you pre-order the limited edition sugar babes um and you get this one? um a male etc. Okay Matthew, let's move on to your number seven number eight.

Matthew
02:01:42
My number eight is foundation series three. Ah, not on my list. Yeah, and this has just been quietly churning away in the background. It's Apple TV's uh adaptation of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. I've really enjoyed this from the start. They threw a huge amount of money at this, got an amazing cast. It has a really epic scale to it. I can't explain and break down the foundation universe, but the the the key idea in it is that a mathematician has basically predicted the end of civilization and is trying to build almost like a library or a depository of all humankind's progress so that when the end times come, what civilization comes next, we'll be able to to build from that and restart. But sort of opposed to that is the current empire who who you know rule the universe, who obviously don't ever see themselves ending and if they go along with his plan it's accepting their own downfall. But the through various gimmicks such as some characters being holograms, some people being cryogenically frozen and the Emperors being a genetic dynasty which constantly clones the same person, it means the show can jump hundreds of years between seasons and several cast members can remain. So even though it resets maybe eighty percent of the cast, you always have Lee Pace as the Emperor of the Universe, because he's just cloning himself, but his clones are becoming like more and more deranged over time. That is j and that in itself is a brilliant hook. Every season you're like What leap ace are we gonna get? Like, is he gonna be n a nice emperor? Is he gonna be one of the bad ones? He's got like an older clone and a younger clone and they kind of mix them up. This particular season, like the mix of who was a good clone and who was a bad clone was really fun. There was like a villain called the Mule, who was a sort of mutant telekinetic chap who could uh uh you know who threatens to kind of bring down the whole thing and and and sort of uh splinter off the path that the foundation is charting and uh it's Like, not a show you join at season three, like you join on season one, but I do think it's worth doing. I think it's like quietly the closest thing we have to like a Game of Thrones at the moment. in terms of like the big swings and like the episodes where, you know, entire planets are destroyed and loads of characters are off, it's it's very sort of uncaring in that way and that makes it, you know, dramatically very satisfying. So it's big and nerdy, but it it's uh Yeah, a b a beautiful, expensive blockbuster sci-fi show, and there's not a lot of that.

Samuel
02:04:23
Yeah, I uh I I I've got Apple TV till May, Matthew, because I got half off for six months. Um And I've alright I've already got through two things. So I think it it might be low-key the best streaming service these days. Um it's got a lot going on if you're If you wait for it to back up a little bit and it's uh and then churn through a bunch of stuff at once. And I I've heard you recommend this several times. for the Lee Pace Jared Harris of it all. I So I'm glad to hear it's still it's still delivering for it.

Matthew
02:04:50
Yeah, still still got the goods.

Samuel
02:04:52
Yeah. Okay. My number eight is Daredevil Born Again. Um a cobbled together season of TV. Um they shot one version, then the writer's strike happened, and then they uh shot another version. on top of it with more Daredevil. Um stitched it together and somehow the show still worked. Um it is uneven but has Uh some some things about it are way better than the Netflix version of Daredevil that this is basically the a soft reboot of And um yeah, so it brings back uh Charlie Cox as Matt Murdoch. And uh something bad has happened in Matt Murdoch's life that is shown in the very first episode. And y you're kind of slowly getting back to it's a year basically a year passes after these events of this first episode, basically the prologue. And then You basically have Matt Murdoch picking up his life and uh sort of like rees restarting his uh legal career and then kind of like beginning his journey back to becoming Daredevil again and uh the the different uh the different ways in which that impacts his life. Um it sort of Blends the Daredevil thing with a bit of a case of the week or case of every two or three episodes type structure. And um there's a couple of arcs in this that work really well. There is an arc with a character called the White Tiger. That is taken directly from the Brian Michael Bendis Alex Maliv run on Daredevil, which is my favourite run with the character ever. So so good. And it's it it's adapted so faithfully that I thought they really delivered on the potential of it. Then there's another arc that features a very fintuque serial killer that was pretty naff and didn't really land um the plane. And then there's a bit at the end where the Punisher turns up. And starts um shooting Dirty Cops in the Head, which absolutely rules, and I thought was really good fun. And I basically came to the conclusion that this was a flawed but entertaining season of TV. It's a way better pace than the old Netflix ones. And I think the second season of this will probably be the best one they've ever done. Um and that is um saying something for a show uh the whole Marvel TV project has been a complete failure to me from the overly flabby Netflix shows that had about four episodes worth of stories stretched out over thirteen hours, um to the very glossy Covid era shows that just felt like missed opportunity after missed opportunity. um and didn't feel like proper TV shows, they felt like overly long movies sliced up. Um this is like much closer to what a Marvel TV show should be. Um so yes, I was pretty impressed by it and I was expecting pretty bad things after all the behind the scenes um snaffus, Matthew. So yeah. What's the number seven? Give her a watch. I've skipped this one. Oh I will you like it? I don't I think you'll think, oh geez, that was up and down. And it is, but um yes. Um what's the number seven?

Matthew
02:07:38
My number seven is The Devil's Plan Season 2, which is a Netflix reality show. I think uh I spoke about it on a previous XXL which is like a load of brainiacs competing in a game show where every round is a game. Sometimes it's a board game, sometimes it's a social deduction game. They have incredibly complicated rules. you know, to the extent that it sometimes takes half an hour of the show just to explain the rules of the game you're about to watch. So it isn't like it isn't dumbed down for TV at all. Like it feels like a load of sort of like th you know, strategy game lovers and war game lovers and and genuinely very sort of sharp, bright people are competing at these games. They often have an element that lets you screw other people over, so there's sort of a underhand drama. Uh i it's it's probably worth watching series one and series two 'cause there are some interesting kind of connective tissue between them and the people in season two are kind of aware of what happened in season one and that colours some of their thinking. I think season two is a stronger season 'cause it also introduces this uh sort of subdungeon area where people who perform poorly are sent to and are forced to play sort of smaller games which are actually much easier to pass than the main games that they play in the episodes, but have the same kind of thrilling kind of one-upmanship and ability to screw each other over. So if you want to see some very sharp Korean celebrities um trying to like dick each other over in games you probably don't understand. The Devil's Pan is a a very entertaining ten or so hours of TV on Netflix.

Samuel
02:09:21
Good stuff, Matthew. I always like hearing you uh recommend uh This one or shows a bit like this one. So um there may be another on my list. I look forward to it. My number seven is slow horses, Matthew. Is this on your list? It didn't make my list this year. Yeah, I didn't think it would. I've put it in here. A because I've watched it and as specify as mentioned. Yes, okay. Um but B, I actually did think this was a bit better than season four. Uh definitely. Oh good, I'm glad you agree. Because I I think that both of this and season four have been lumped in as a sort of like downturn for the show. And while I think that one, two, and three are clearly there's like an arc going up there of, you know, quality each season. U Um, or at least they are sort of like within the same range, these two are do just feel slightly less consequential. However, um the fact that this show this this season focuses more specifically on um uh Roddy Ho, who is the basically IT guy, toxic dickhead who everyone hates in the uh in Sloughhouse was actually made it a slightly lighter season, even though some pretty heavy stuff happens in it. And I think that it was a nice antidote to season four, which was trying to be like, oh, here is the ultimate evil. Um and and like lit building up to that moment in a way that I just don't I didn't think was very effective. Um this just feels like the stakes are a bit lower. There are more jokes, and the jokes are very well written. There's some of the Gary Oldman's best ever lines in this season. And I found it Still really entertaining. I went through it in like a day and a half and no problem. And it is very dependable and it is very predictable at this point. And I do hope that it gets to have like another really good dramatic season that gets your pulse racing again, like season three did, the end of that. Um but still really like the character development there, still really like the performances. Um it is a bit of comfort food TV at this point Um but it's not it's I don't think the hand is off the tiller or anything. I thought this is still pretty solid. What do you think?

Matthew
02:11:26
I I don't really know what it could do to kind of completely get back in my favour and and be like one of the great TV shows. I think it's just It's just too familiar, but it is solid. It is good. Uh I think it's the peril of, you know, adapting a series of books like this, you know, but but it's very, very hard for a book series. to constantly like innovate and there are gonna be some stories you like more and some you like less. I definitely think this show is stronger when it keeps all its characters together or keeps as many of them in the same place as Gary Oldman as possible. But you just want to see him being rude to people and season four, like, you know Fucking River was in France for half of it. What was going on with that? It was that was really, really hard work. Um But and I I still don't think it has quite recovered from the loss of um Freddie Fox.

Samuel
02:12:17
Yeah, I agree with that.

Matthew
02:12:18
Who is just like there's a big, big Freddy Fox-shaped hole in the middle of this show for like a really nasty asshole. They've replaced him with other snide assholes, but none of them have been quite right. Gaius Baltar, like did his best but didn't quite work. Um Uh he's just a bit soft that character. And I didn't like the m the London m mayoral stuff in this one. I thought They were pretty broad as well.

Samuel
02:12:40
That was the weakest part of it for sure.

Matthew
02:12:41
Yeah.

Samuel
02:12:41
The make London lunderful again. That was all a bit of a that was a big a big groan. It's like did you write this during COVID kind of feel about it? But Yeah, I will definitely keep watching this. Um, it is still entertaining. But yeah, it's a slight step up from season four, and therefore I don't mind recommending it again here. What's your number six, Matthew? Department Q. Higher on my list. Oh, finally. Yeah. My number six is task. Oh, higher on my list. Oh nice. Then what's your number five? It's task. Alright, okay, good. Do you want to talk about it?

Matthew
02:13:14
Yeah, uh how much of this have you watched? Uh I've watched all of it. I just finished it. Oh nice, oh okay. Yeah, so this is uh the the follow-up n it's not linked to, but it's the next show from the creator of Mare of East Town. um follows a FBI agent played by Mark Ruffalo. Someone has been robbing sort of drug stash houses. Um in where's it set? I always forget.

Samuel
02:13:40
It's like is it f it's a Philadelphia Way, right? It's near like the outskirts of Philadelphia that are sticks around it. Um I'll just look it up where it's set so we've got that information on the record. Um but yeah it's um set in it does say Philadelphia, but yeah, uh Delaware County. There you go.

Matthew
02:13:59
That's more than Delaware, yes, Del the Delco accent they keep talking about Uh I think the writer is from wherever it is set and you know certainly I've you know from listening to uh the Watch podcast l talk about this show, I you know, I feel like it's clearly steeped in like local custom and tradition and culture in a way which is really like electrifying if you are from there but as someone who lives in Bath, which obviously isn't that uh I you know I can still enjoy this, you know, cat and mouse tale of of Mark Ruffalo trying to bring in you know, some I'd say robbers with a h with a sort of heart of gold, uh, who are on both a collision course with the FBI and also a bunch of uh a biker gang who they're stealing the drugs from And yeah, it's quite tight, I think like seven episodes, maybe eight. Yep. Um and yeah, has has all these characters. I it does that classic thing where I think you feel uh quite a lot of affection for both m both Mark Ruffalo and his task force and the the robbers and the families, you know, the robbers with the heart of gold. but you sort of know deep down that, you know, this has got to end badly for someone at some point. I th I thought it was a decent thriller, but I, you know, fundamentally is probably about, you know, slightly bigger ideas, um, particularly with the Mark Ruffalo character and he's wrestling with some stuff and it's about you know, what he learns about himself from chasing after this robber, what he learns from the robber himself. Uh and I thought it was quite moving, quite effec uh uh quite affecting. I I I thought this had the shape of like my TV show of the year and it didn't quite get there. Like maybe there was just like a little bit too much plot for how many episodes there were and some things felt a little bit rushed, but I think when when this did kind of slow down and and hit its kind of character beats well, uh it was, you know, about as a good a TV show as I saw this year.

Samuel
02:16:02
Yeah, it feels like um it's much closer to that classic HBO drama than anything else from from this year. And so on that level it's re it's reassuring to see that The Mare of East Town guy got to do something else next. And I know he follows you on Twitter, Matthew, which is a big deal for you. So that's um Well I think that was the director of Mare of East Town on the writer. Okay, sorry, okay. I'm getting mixed up. Um a really interesting show in the sense that Mark Ruffalo is is like the least interesting thing about it, even though he's obviously your dependable like um sort of worn down FBI character. That's the thing, there's a lot of archetypes in this. And I think that from like the biker gang guys who are the de facto villains um to the The robbers who again they have like their a slightly familiar Robin Hood, but the elements to them. Um and so It's all really about how successfully do the characters break out of those archetypes and and give you uh show you something different. And I don't think Mark Ruffalo quite does, but um Tom Pelfrey, who is the main robber, Robbie um Prendergrast. Um hard to say that name to be honest. Um but uh Tom He's like such a great character because he is he does have a good reason to be robbing these drug dealers, um, this biker gang. He has like a a revenge-based reason why he he might want to do that And um he is he is a family man at the same time he's trying to keep his family together, but he's not very good at that, but he has clearly got a heart of gold underneath it all. Um really good performance uh by Amelia Jones, who plays his niece in this, who is sort of like the real parent of that of that household, even though she doesn't want to be. Um they got loads of kids living in this house and they are struggling through life. And yeah, you do um I will say that e even though I do think that the pacing is a bit up and down um in this show Uh like you say that there is quite a lot of plot, like it does something does happen in every episode that it does move it does move forward, like you're not waiting forever um for the tu for the task force to figure out who the robbers are. And then it becomes about, yeah, when you do get these characters together, like How uh you know, it it can be it's it's pretty illuminating TV and like Sir Matthew says movie. Um it's well worth watching. It's not uh quite of that really high quality bar that you want a HBO drama to be at. I would say it's not quite as good as Mayor of East Town.

Matthew
02:18:35
Um I pre I think mayor I preferred Mayor of Easttown. I thought Kate Winslit was so good in that and it just saw through its like emotional arc a bit more clearly.

Samuel
02:18:44
It did, yeah. Um yeah this show is not quite as successful but And I was really surprised to see it got a second season because a bit like Mayor of East Town, you kinda I kinda thought, oh, the story's done. So but you know, um curious to see what they make of it. I mean I in theory, like I I could see what they would do with it. Um maybe a bit easier than Mayor of East Town, where the case is very much woven into her personal life in a way that makes it quite hard to give her another case of the same meaning Um this show is a little bit more I could see how you might see it as more procedural, but yeah, it's it's well worth watching. Um even if it's not like you you wish it was just about 10% better, you know what I mean? Yeah, I I would agree with that. Okay. Then uh we come to my number five, which is the studio, Matthew. Is this on your list? It it isn't it isn't, no. Yeah, this this seems high, but I did very much enjoy this this year. Um it was still you know, I wanted to put one comedy shape thing on here. Um it does have a bit of a whiff of the old star fuckery about it, um, which might be uh you know, uh you may see as a pro or a negative depending on how you feel about gratuitous cameo appearances and the like. It is about uh Seth Rogan running this fictional movie studio. Um they're making dog shit film after dog shit film really. Um and he's gotta keep the the the wheels turning. Um some episodes do not work and then some episodes work incredibly well. Um really good ensemble cast in this. Um I was I was pretty impressed generally and um I look forward to seeing what a second season does with it because there are yeah there's like I would say like maybe two to three episodes in this that would be in my top ten TV episodes of the year and um yeah just it's it's a a little bit Yeah, it's it I've we've seen the kind of like extra style behind the scenes of films and TV show thing before, but not with this much money. Um it's got so much Apple money hosed onto the screen that it's really something. Um and it's a it's a brisk watch as well. So I liked it and wanted to just give it a shout out, Matthew. Thoughts?

Matthew
02:20:43
Yeah, I I did like it. I actually I I I did think about putting this um lower down the list. Uh also I really liked Platonic, which was the other Seth Rogan Apples TV show. I mean, that guy is so prolific on there it's ridiculous. Um but yeah I'd say both of them are very easy watchers with lots of winning performances. I think I think the cameos in this are quite hit and miss.

Samuel
02:21:09
I think some of them are pure gold and some of them are a little bit cringe, so Yeah, I was yeah, the uh Yeah, and also like um I guess our guy Ike Barenholtz is a big reason that this show is um is is so entertaining. Who would be in your um who is who is like a real dud for you from this season, Matthew? I I know people really like it. I actually didn't like the Ron Howard stuff. Oh, see I like Ron Howard, but I thought Anthony Mackey wasn't quite tuned into uh into it.

Matthew
02:21:36
But uh who is it? There's someone they go to Vegas and someone like absolutely loses it in the hotel room. Uh Is it Is it Dave is it Dave Franco? Oh yeah, Dave Franco's say, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he's he's alright. Yeah. I don't know, I just I like you're you're more surprised to see like m Martin Scorsese pull that off than you are like

Samuel
02:21:59
They're comedy mates. I really like that Sarah Polly episode where it was her film set that he was fucking up. That was like a really Like a really well-produced um bit of TV. Um yeah, that was enjoyable. So yeah, it's rock solid. It's not amazing, but it's like pretty good. And that's TV this year, baby. What's the number four, Matthew? My number four is Blue Lights Season Three on BBC.

Matthew
02:22:23
Uh, not on my list, but I do want to check this out. We we hadn't watched any of Blue Lights, we watched all three seasons. If I could group all three seasons together, I'd say this is the best thing I watched this year. was discovering this show, season one, absolutely fantastic. Uh it's about uh it f it follows the from the first season, some sort of trainee policeman in Belfast. And each season sort of, you know, it jumps through time that, you know, they are becoming, you know, more trained up, more kind of professional as they go on and climbing the ranks. What I really like about the show is all the characters are absolutely brilliant. It's a really good m blend of overarching storylines that sort of give you the shape of the show, there's like a villain each season they're trying to bring down. But it also has lots of individual instance because they're you know they're basic like first responder officers and they're constantly being sent out so they're every episode they're just going into loads of houses and not really knowing what they're gonna find. Is it gonna be a dead body Is it going to be like a really violent situation in motion? Is it going to be something funny? You never really know. And so it's a really nice mix of the kind of procedural everyday life of these cops. plus the overarching storyline, plus just absolutely brilliant character arcs for everyone involved. Everyone has something to do. everyone learns something, sometimes there are huge upsets, you know, it's not afraid to delve into their sort of personal lives as well. It sort of follows them home and the sort of soapy drama that's playing out b between them. But I honestly, when when you watch a show like this, which is on BBC I play it's a BBC mate show, six episode seasons, you know, it is just absolutely lethal in its construction, like how efficient it is, how many storylines they pack in, the big emotional beats. You know, if you go from watching something like season five of Stranger Things, which is this like whatever it is, 12 hour behemoth spread out over three content drops and compare it to, you know, how much you learn you know, about these characters and learn to love these characters in six hour seasons. It is it's just in another league entirely. Like UKTV when it's when it's really really good. is just some of the the cleanest, best TV making in the world. And I haven't seen a show which is kind of reminded me of that in a while, you know? It's it's it's just really really good. I'm not saying season three isn't necessarily the strongest of the three. I think the first season of this was the best But even so I th I thought it really held it together. Great villains, a proper like, you know, tear up a couple of times a season watching this because it really hits you in the field. Yeah, I think Blue Lights is absolutely fantastic. And I wouldn't have started watching it if uh the people on Discord didn't talk about it so much. So Thank you, Discord. You finally got something right.

Samuel
02:25:32
Yeah, my parents that and the uh Simpsons um uh stills Matthew for video games. Oh yeah, the Discord really delivering in uh Yeah, this season. Coming in clutch at the end of uh twenty twenty five. Um yeah, my um my parents watched all three series of this this year as well and said it was you gotta watch this, it's really good. So Um on the list it goes, and that's a great recommendation, Matthew. I'm sure that'll just get more people to check it out, which is um which is good. Like we say, all on iPlayer, which is fantastic.

Matthew
02:26:00
It feels like it's become like one of the BBC's biggest shows. Like you know, they've already commissioned the next season for next year and you know, it it feels like it's very much filling the the line of duty gap.

Samuel
02:26:13
Yeah, for sure. Um yeah, and I I could see why why it would capture people's imaginations. It sounds like a pretty authentic show from everything I've read about it. So um yes. Okay Matthew, department queue is my number four. Um, so we did talk about this on that episode we did earlier this year, I think, on things that have come out this year that we uh kind of this episode but mid year version basically. And uh yes, um basically uh in Edinburgh, a uh a cop who has suffered a recent attack um when investigating uh a dead body, um, is basically given uh sort of the not quite the budget, but he's given like the the directive to launch a new cold case department basically They pick one case and investigate it. What happens to this um uh this uh she a prosecutor, Matthew? I can't remember now. She's a a lawyer of some kind.

Matthew
02:27:05
Yes, that's right, yeah.

Samuel
02:27:06
Yeah, and um she disappeared four years earlier. And uh uh basically they he he is to this this detective played by Matthew Good is um teamed up with Uh someone who is not a detective but in in his um home country of Syria was uh a police officer or law enforcement of some kind. That is part of the mystery of the show that r unravels really a minor mystery. And then they investigate whether this um this woman is dead, she had a lot of enemies, um, or whether she might still be alive. And um it kind of like goes from there basically and the the the department slowly grows and there is this meta mystery really of um who shot the main character, um this uh detective uh mork um who uh yeah, it it you basically see You get little bits and pieces of clues of of what happened in that initial shooting at the very start of the show, but that is not resolved in this season, so It's a reason to come back. They have renewed it for a second season, so that's cool. Um, but the actual mystery of what happened to this woman is resolved in this um eight episode season. Um, it is a slightly flabby show, they are hour-long episodes, and it probably has about six hours worth of plots stretched over eight. However, it is immaculately made. um and acted. Matthew Good is amazing in this. He's surrounded by um Scottish cast members as you might expect and they include the likes of um Kate uh Dickey, who you might know from Game of Thrones, Kelly MacDonald, who obviously I'm sure many people know. And um Mark Bernard, who I thought was um Robert Carlisle and turned out not to be, um but from but from certain angles did look a bit like him in my defence. Um I just really a show where bastards get hit in the face a lot. Like there's a quite a lot of violence in this and people get properly fucked up and It's just nice to see some dickheads get fucked up. These days I'm really looking for that from my TV and film. Um so I thought it was really strong, Matthew, and the mystery Uh they did a great job of peeling it back. It's a very detailed plot really. I think I it's it's definitely not a f have your phone out show. Um there's a it goes in loads of different directions and there are tons of details. It's like Very novelistic in that respect. It is a stacked uh sort of mystery to unpick. Um anything to add?

Matthew
02:29:17
Yeah, I I love this. I maybe should have put this above task, 'cause I think I probably actually did enjoy it more than that. Um Yeah, m big series of books as well, uh, so that they can keep coming back to it. I think they are doing a second series. It's been successful enough. Uh yeah, just agree with everything you say. Great cast, Matthew Good, great. really dense knotty mystery which is fun to unpick. Uh I did an ending explained video for the Netflix YouTube channel and it took me a fucking age to unpick this one. It was so complicated. But um Yes, great stuff. Hmm. What's the number three, Matthew?

Samuel
02:29:54
My number three is Pluribus. Ah, not on my list, but I will watch it at some point.

Matthew
02:30:00
Yes, so uh yeah, this is the the Vince Gilligan's next show after Breaking Bad and Better Causeall stars uh Ray Seahorn who played Betaculsaul. Can we talk about what this one's about? I don't know if this is how out there it is now.

Samuel
02:30:17
Well, I don't really know what it's about, but there's a lot of high Carol content out there and I Okay, well I I'm not gonna spoil it for you because part of the pleasure for this is they really kept it under wraps what it was and when you're watching episode one

Matthew
02:30:31
You know, it takes a long time to reveal its hand. And I would say it's incredibly high concept show. In a roundabout way, it's like a very weird two-hander The the scenario it presents is almost so so reduced, uh and it feels so limited, you think, how can they possibly make this a show? Like what is the show gonna be here? and it takes its sweet time in sort of investigating that situation. I mean that's really how they get around it, is they just take a huge amount of time to explore any piece of the story that they're gonna explore. I'd say in in a way which is very familiar to Better Call Saul, you know, it's a show which really like luxuriated in the process and the details of things. Um uh this is uh yeah I'd say a bit more experimental than that what it's doing genre-wise. But I think I maybe liked it more as a bit of like TV craft and like the audacity of it. I think Ray Seon is absolutely brilliant in it. You know, incredibly watchable. I think the the the few actors that surround her are also really well picked and it's it's really interesting seeing those relationships develop but it's Yeah, it's I I this almost like a huge question mark still hanging over this despite having seen whole of season one where I just I have no idea where they could possibly be going with this show. Um And uh but at the same time I wouldn't say it's like a mystery book show at all. I don't think you're meant to watch it and and sort of theorize endlessly. I don't think it's like a severance. It's a bit more sort of sophisticated than that. Like it always comes down to there's this weird situation, how is it impacting on this this lady, Carol? uh and her decision making and that is amazingly like a good enough hook to carry on watching. So yeah, it's yeah, a real weird one.

Samuel
02:32:28
But e excellent. Vague enough that I appreciate it, Matthew. Um I will definitely um give that a watch. It's uh yeah, it's high on the list. I was um a bit uh frazzled to see that uh Vince Gilligan's not in a rush to make season two and I'm a bit like, can you please just crack on with it actually because that's the big problem with Severance, the show I skipped season two of because it they just took too long to make that second season and uh I don't want to wait three years for a TV show anymore, but um yeah. Uh so yeah, okay, good. I will check it out and um I'll mess I'll message you when I do. My number three is um the documentary series Mr. Scorsese on Apple TV Plus, Matthew. Guessing you've not seen this.

Matthew
02:33:09
I haven't seen this though. This is on my to watch list.

Samuel
02:33:13
Oh, I absolutely loved it. I I think it was I mean, you know, obviously we did the Scorsese deep dive. Um admittedly we didn't watch Kunden for the episode we did, but otherwise pretty comprehensive. We've got to draw the line somewhere. Yeah. Um so this is a a portrait by the director Rebecca Miller. I guess it is like a long film divided up into episodes really, but it does roughly break down per decade really, and then sort of the last two decades are sort of in basically the last episode of it. Um, but uh really great at digging into his background, including you know the the real life gangsters who he who he knew and um you know or was at least like vaguely familiar with. and uh his sort of background of his life and then the massive ups and downs he had um as he went in terms of like his you know, usage of drugs in the in the seventies and eighties and then getting clean and the effect that had and you know, just it dials in on the right films when you when you want it to. And then kinda like it ha it and then skips over the ones where maybe you don't need fifteen minutes on bringing out the dead as much as I enjoyed it, but Um it'll still give you the seven minutes of silence that you crave, which is what I really wanted when watching this film. Um, the watch watching this show. So yeah, really impressive. Uh it's incredibly Moorish. I watched it on I think like Boxing day, I just watched Chew through the whole thing. Um yeah, really good and no disputing, they got some amazing talking heads. Um Daniel Day Lewis who's mana married to the filmmaker um but still quite a rare you know, interviewee. Um DiCaprio's here and pretty much all of his main stars are here, De Niro's here. Some of the guys he grew up with are in this as well. And Great insights on Goodfellas and Casino in particular. Um really worth a watch. And uh yeah. Nope, he did he did not um he did not do the interview. Um so you get archive footage of him, but That's all right. They make it work. You won't appear on camera unless you de-age him 50 years. Um he appeared in fucking Pete Davidson's TV show on Peacock. Why wouldn't he do this? Anyway, it's fine. Not my problem, really. So yes, Matthew, a thorough recommendation. What's your number two?

Matthew
02:35:25
My number two is a uh Uh Castle Classic. I may have talked about it earlier in the year. In fact, I think I definitely did. This is Asura on Netflix. Yes, this is uh filmmaker uh Coriad uh uh made he's made several TV shows for Netflix. Uh this is about four sisters dealing with the aftermath of a revelation about their their father and uh an affair he had is introduced fairly early on. I wouldn't say that's a big spoiler. And it causes all of them to look at their lives, uh, their own relationships, their own partners. And it's about, yeah, th I I guess I mean no it really is sort of as simple as that. It's a you know, a Koriada family drama, which are, you know, usually uh confined to two hour films, you know, told over a leisurely six hours, absolutely impeccable cast, very warm domestic settings, you know, like Koriada's great skill is putting you into Japanese homes from certain eras and they just feel very, very lived in and very well realized and even though the storylines verge on the melodramatic and, you know, deal with some unlikely things I think he never really l loses sight of the realism. It's a re he's a really interesting director and that I wouldn't ever say any of his films feel they feel real, but I wouldn't say they ever veer into like gritty realism. There's there's something a bit more sort of formal about them and I don't know if that's like a Japanese sensibility or just the nature of the families that he's telling stories about. But um you know there's a there's like a i it's always entertaining even as it deals with some like quite chewy, heavy material. Um it's like really shallow to say, but like all the four sisters in this are just incredibly easy people to fall in love with. Um you know, they're all not not you know not just beautiful but like brilliant, interesting characters and you really root for all of them and kind of despair for their sort of lousy husbands and boyfriends has an all-timer of uh opening and closing uh title sequence where you just see them sort of going off at their partners and then the book ending sequence is the partner receiving it. um which I really like. It's, you know, not flashy, hasn't appeared on many like show of the year lists. I think it came out in the first week of January this year and is largely forgotten about, but however many things Netflix do make, that they give money to like one of the world's greatest filmmakers to make a piece of TV that only he could make, like, that's easily worth a month's subscription for me.

Samuel
02:38:16
Hmm. Yeah, okay. Well I'll put this on the to watch list. I know it came out early in the year, but um yeah, it did pass me by, but uh always he enjoy hearing you go to Bat for Coriaders. Oh, I love it. Yeah, okay, Matthew, good stuff. Um my number two is um Andor, the Star Wars TV show, which I know won't be on Matthew's list, but that's okay. It isn't though, I did like it a lot. I thought this was better than season one, um, which was very slow-paced. It was you know, the season one uh told the story of one year um of the build-up to the rebellion, basically, and the events of Rogue One. and therefore the Star Wars series in general. Um and then uh yes, this this season uh they realised it would take fifteen years to do that for all five seasons as they originally planned it. So they condense five seasons into one. Uh sorry, four seasons into one. So you get years two, three. four and five all squashed together in these um three episode arcs and it means you have uh big time jumps um between episodes which work really well I think um in terms of Telling a continuous story and one particular story of basically imperial propaganda to justify wiping out a people Um which is a really well done, well constructed and timely arc. And it is a good bit of Star Wars as well. It does give you a couple of bits of uh sort of like a couple of set pieces and um battles and spaceships for your for your dollar. Um but it does function pretty well as a quite a you know a sort of uh broadly enjoyable um political uh thriller in places. Um yeah, it's uh and then it does have one episode where um K2SO uh K2SO the big robot fucks up a load of lads. It's just really about as good as Star Wars has gotten um in the last few years. And um I don't think they'll make any more TV shows like this, to be honest. I think Andor was a one-off and the next Star Wars TV thing is Ahsoka season two. I mean I would say that whole Dave Filone strand of Star Wars is of no interest to me, so I don't I don't really care about that. Um I hope those who enjoy that I I wish them well, you know. Um but uh yeah it was it was I would say even even better than I thought it was gonna be. Um it just has like two to three absolute standout episodes and Um I thought Stellan Skarsgar was brilliant in this as well, as like a a more radical rebel leader who gets marginalized as the season goes on. Like that's uh That's an actor who is amazing in everything he's in, but um that character really left an impact with me. So um yeah, good stuff, Matthew. And uh yes. Okay, what's your number one? I guess the same as my number one. No Is it it? I d I don't think so.

Matthew
02:40:57
Oh, okay, what's the number one? I'm curious what your number one is now. Okay, go on Well my number one, and maybe this is recency bias, but I have mentioned it a couple of times, it is the Netflix Culinary Cooking Competition, culinary class wars. Okay, we do not have the same number one. I didn't think we did. I was uh season one of this I think came out the end of last year, and uh Martin Davies, when was visiting Bath put me onto it And me and Catherine absolutely devoured it in a weekend. I mean, I'm putting this here because it's purely the most entertaining bit of TV I've seen this year, which is you know, what the list is fundamentally about. I don't watch a lot of reality TV show. I certainly don't watch a lot of cooking shows, so that I am so into this uh is you know uh unexpected even to me. It's a cooking show which pitches professional, established, famous chefs, who are known as the Whitespoons, against a class of upcoming chefs or chefs from more unusual backgrounds. To put it in terms that this podcast will understand, imagine a cooking show Where JC from JC's Kitchen is competing with Heston Blumenthal to see which of them is fundamentally better at cooking. That's the hook of this show. So the g the the the Blackspoons, who are the upcomers, you know, some of them are like dinner ladies and some of them are food you know, street vendors and things like that. And i the uh but the actual nature of the competition is it's incredibly highly produced. It's sort of the squid games of cooking shows, and I'm not just saying that as a lazy Korean comparison. but because the nature of the competition, like the the rounds are very experimental, like each round is very different. There are lots of like gimmicks and twists to sort of uh you know, uh draw out extra drama from it. Uh there are loads of interesting pairings where you end up with chefs who trained off under other chefs competing with them and lots of backstories like that. And It's such an immaculate bit of TV production, the way it shows you all these rounds, the way it captures all the action, the way it frames the stories, the way it introduces and frames each chef. uh say you're invested in every single person. Um there's so many people competing. You just get to see so much amazing food being made and you get to see so much judging. And that's really what I live for, the moment someone sticks a bit of food in their gob. and says whether or not they like it, because often they don't. And the two sh the two judges of it, one of them is like a sort of celebrity known for loving food, like this this sort of kindly sort of 60-year-old guy who's like super in he's like a man of the people who likes all the kind I guess more of your kind of Greg Wallace I would guess I sort of like that. And the other guy is an incredibly elite chef himself and their pairing's really fun. It's an amazing bit of TV. It's very different to narrative TV, but It's the thing I've been looking forward to all this year. Uh we haven't quite finished season two because they're putting it out in episode chunks. So it actually finishes in the new year. But uh we've watched ten episodes of thirteen. It's it's epic, this TV show. And yeah, I just absolutely love it. I didn't think this would happen to me this late in life. Um but it has. Uh I'm so invested. Uh I don't want to spoil it, but uh There's a monk who I really want to lose this season, and I'm very invested in that because they keep serving up fucking just plain carrots, and it feels like I'm going mad that no one else can see this. So um Please watch the show.

Samuel
02:44:48
Well I hope you made it to the end of the third hour of this podcast to hear that recommendation 'cause that instantly that instantly sold me. That was really good. Um Wow, okay. I mean I did not expect us to be on number one. Um, but I'm glad that happened to you. And it you did make it sound very compelling. So um good stuff, Matthew. Straight on the watch list it goes. Jesus Christ. Um Wow. This is like when Deep Fried Masters happened to me a few years ago and the whole PC gamer team. We all got into that. It's sometimes these shows you just need the right form of it and then it really is it really does hit you like fast food or something. It's um very snackable. Okay. Uh my number one is adolescence. Um which I'm surprised didn't make your list, but I mean it was uh such a phenomenon of this year. I don't even feel like I need to go into it in a huge amount of detail. We've talked about it in the podcast before. We have made jokes about this show before. Um remember Adolescence VR and the Adolescence MMO jokes, Matthew? Those are some gags that happened this year on this podcast. Very inappropriate. Four episodes long, about something very harrowing, about something very real, um but also just really like really well made, um dramatic, tense TV, amazingly rendered characters, great performances. Um not just like, you know, destined to be the sort of fodder that lazy teachers put on in class and they can't be bothered to do any actual teaching. Um which is gonna happen no doubt in school in years to come. People are gonna be like, all right, sit down kids, you're gonna watch this. It's really serious, so make sure you're paying attention. That's gonna happen a lot. Um, but it is like um it is genuinely great in its own right. And uh yes, I won't go into all the specifics of what happens in the show because it's a bummer, frankly, and we've been recording for three hours. Um just go look it up, Adolescence on Netflix. That is your recommendation, but it is really good, so um in it goes, Matthew. W in the end, did you think it was just too much of a bummer to recommend it or just too obvious, Matthew?

Matthew
02:46:41
No, it wasn't it wasn't that it was too much of a bummer or that it was too obvious. I mean I sh I should say as part of my day job Uh we had to do a lot of stuff with adolescence, which maybe killed my enthusiasm for it. Like I just had to you know, when you have to do something for work and what rewatch a show over and over again. You become slightly immune to it. Yeah. But I mean it is undeniably the TV story of this year. I must admit, not in a sneety way, it didn't kinda cross my mind to include it, but I think that is purely because of the the work connection. And fundamentally I'm more invested in that monk and their carrots than I am a state of the nation r uh bit of TV that breaks all the boundaries.

Samuel
02:47:25
Thankfully that Work Connection didn't take down Steve 2025, which um made it into the list. That's that's good, thank you. Okay, the podcast is over. It ran an hour long than me and Matthew planned it to uh to to run, but um that always happens, doesn't it, Matthew? Um so all I'll say is thank you for listening to the podcast this year and thank you for supporting us. We have Never had more people um supporting us on Patreon. We're very grateful for that. Um it inches towards the reality where perhaps um this could be a day job um for myself and Matthew. You know, that's sort of a pipe dream still, but Nonetheless, it's very flattering and it encourages us to uh invest even more time and energy into the podcast, paying our guests more money, all that stuff. So uh yeah, thank you really. That's it. And um yeah Matthew, I guess I'll see you on January 9th for the next regular podcast because we're having a Friday off. Um happy new year and see you soon. Bye-bye. See you soon. Bye-bye.
