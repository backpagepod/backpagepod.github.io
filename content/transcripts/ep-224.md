Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. Sorry, got a bit deranged there, the Matthew Castle pronunciation. I do apologize.
We are once again joined by two special guests, Ashley Day and Dave Scarborough, last heard as a pair on the PS2 Redraft episode we did earlier this year. Episode went down really well, so we thought, why not do it again with the same combination of guests, the same cursed, misogynistic energy that Dave brought to the table.
Speak for yourself.
I'm only joking. I thought it might be fun to bring back that chaotic energy from that episode. So Ash Dave, how does it feel to return to the podcast?
Are you ready for more childish insults? Ash, how are you feeling about it?
It's a shame we got all of our childish insults out of the way in the last 30 minutes while we were waiting for Dave to figure out how to use his PC. But I could probably muster some more.
Yeah, I would imagine so. I've always got energy to insult Dave. Dave Aiden, you alright?
I'm doing alright. As I say, a little exasperated from having to fiddle around with my PC to get it working after many restarts and microphone failures but obviously it's a pleasure to be here guys. I love the podcast and always a great opportunity to come and trade Barbz with Ufine folks.
Yeah, absolutely. I'm excited to hear you pick up FIFA 09 for Wildcard in that practice.
Ash made the exact same joke to me earlier when he rang me to tell me his wife just got scammed at a parking meter.
Focus tested it.
Yeah, exactly. Just A-B testing. I've got eight other gags but that was the best one according to my audience survey.
So that's spot on. Okay, good stuff. Yeah, it's great to have you both.
Ash House Team 17, all good?
Yeah, well, as I said to Matthew earlier, asking how a games company is doing in this climate is a little bit of a risk, but it's going about as well as you could hope. I'm resisting the temptation to plug a load of games, which I don't think it would be.
You could plug a couple of games. Go for it. Why not?
Well, I'm personally working on a game called Date Everything at the moment, which is a dating game where you can date everything including a piano, a games console, it's a lot of stuff in your house that turn into people voiced by real voice actors. It's written and directed by the guy who voices Cyclops in X-Men 97. So in many ways, it might be the best game ever made.
Noctis from Final Fantasy XV, right? Isn't that the same guy? Have I got that right?
That's one of the other guys that's in it, I believe, and all sorts of people. Steve Blum is in it. He's a big anime voice actor guy.
Yeah, if you like voice acting, if you like dating games, if you like weird indie games.
If you're attracted to furniture.
I'm waiting for the mod based on our Imagineers called Date Nothing, Ash. I think that would be more our speed. I've got that one in my back pocket.
Anything else you want to plug, Ash, while you're here?
Worms. Worms is good.
Worms Evergreen, you know, just very much.
It's the 30th anniversary of Worms at the moment, so who knows? We might do some cool things. We might not.
I'll let you guys know.
I look forward to it. Dave, how are you doing?
I'm doing great, you know. I feel like my career got a real boon from being on the podcast last time. Everyone I seem to get in contact with tells me what an absolute shitter I was.
But, you know, it certainly raised my profile in that regard.
Yeah, very much so. I think Dave owes a lot of his recent PR success to me off the back of that. So I'm holding that over him as much as I can.
I will say, last time, I was about, I got made redundant about a week before we recorded that podcast. You know, let's just attribute my surly attitude to the unfortunate circumstances. I'll be much chipper this time.
I feel like instead I'm going to lift you guys up, instead of trying to tear you down. I'm just going to take a whole different approach to it. You know, I'm going to zig instead of zag.
It's a whole new day.
I look forward to it. Who among us hasn't been laid off in the games industry over the past few years?
And then recorded a stinky podcast.
Exactly.
It's very therapeutic.
I'm very much looking forward to this. Xbox 360, very much a console that's close to my heart. A key text of this podcast, for sure.
That console has probably come up more than almost anything else. Maybe Nintendo platforms surpass it a little bit. Matthew, you are on a multi-draft winning streak.
I don't even remember the last time that you lost one. How are you feeling going into this episode?
Yeah, pretty confident. You know, last time you guys sort of tore each other up and split a particular area of the vote. And I feel like I just kind of walked in.
I plan to do the same this time.
Is it tough for you that there are no David Cage games to pick on 360? Matthew, I know they re all on PS3, so that's difficult for you.
You can smear my picks from the last draft all you want. It was still a winning combination, so it literally means nothing to me.
It was. I mean, it was very much like the film Idiocracy to me to see people in our Discord going, Oh, you know what I thought was good was the first five minutes of Fahrenheit. And then no insight in the game beyond that.
But this is a classic Sam Roberts tactic, which is trying to boil 10 games down to one bit of one game he didn't like.
I agree. It's a fresh start. It's going to be a new draft, lots of exciting picks.
I mean, we only had 20 picks before. And the 360 catalog is so, so deep. I mean, I think I even said this on the episode, but you go even like, I think 200 games into the catalog on the Metacritic listing, which I think probably all of us have used for the drafting process on some level.
And I think you're still getting games in the low 80s at that point. There are just so many great games in the system. So, yeah, I think in terms of my own take on the Xbox, we talked about this before, but I very much, I think I do see this as probably my favorite console of all time.
Every now and then, it kind of swaps places with the PS2, but yeah, big fan of it and look forward to revisiting it for this episode. I was super comprehensive about the history of the 360 on that episode that we did previously. That's 130 we did back in 2023, almost two years ago now.
That was a little bit of a kind of background on why the 360 happened and why things were the way they were. Red Ring of Death, all that fun stuff. So I need to revisit on this episode.
Summarize it in a word for our listeners, be really succinct.
Spicy, I don't know. I mean, I didn't prep for that, Dave. Give me another two hours and I'll come up with something better.
Ash, the 360 was the dominant console during our time at Imagine. If memory serves, you were deep into the Wii and DS at the time. What everyone else is playing, like Halo 3, you were playing, what's it like?
Major What's It's Majestic March on the Wii, and other cursed ephemera. What's your relationship with the Xbox 360?
Are you referencing Major Miner's Majestic March? You know I was playing it last year.
No, it came up on an episode me and Matthew just recorded for the Patreon listeners. But I remember you playing at the time and telling me how disappointing it was. I think you've done a Games Jam feature on it, so it was just jammed at the back of my brain.
It was it was very popular on Games TM was the old 360. It was in full swing by the time I arrived on the Mag. I think it had been out like almost a year by that point.
And I joined just as like hands on previews were coming out for Gears of War. I think Bioshock was getting previews at the time. So everyone was everyone was chomping at the bit for 360 to to continue its ascendancy.
I think I think Skyrim had already been out at rising. We reviewed that like the week I joined. I gave it a 9 out of 10 for X 360.
Called it the best game on the console and then Ryan King added the word Japanese into that sentence. They couldn't say it was better than Skyrim. Do you mean Oblivion Ash?
Do you mean Oblivion? You do.
I'm going to do really well on this track.
Skyrim came out when I joined.
Skyrim was on the 360. I'm not far off the truth.
No, you are.
They're just completely different year.
That's how I remember it too. I remember thinking I was a PS2 player, I joined Imagine and was coming to write about the PS3. Little did I know the war had already been lost before the PS3 or even launched in Europe because there was Gears of War, there was Oblivion.
There was such a strong early punch of games and like you say, Dead Rising and to a lesser extent Lost Planet, which I don't think really had the stuff at the time, but sure looked nice on the 360 and got people excited about the hardware. So yeah, that's largely I remember it too, Ash, just a big deal in our office. Do you have much of a personal attachment to it or is it a little bit further away for you as a thing?
I was living in a shared house full of gamers when the 360 came out in, what was it, 2005? My housemate got one day one and we were all very excited. We sat down in the living room and he put Perfect Dark Zero on and I thought, hmm, probably not going to buy one of these just yet.
I think I bought mine for Gears of War 2. I was pretty late on. Obviously, I had played quite a few games in the office.
Similar to the PS2, it became the de facto games console. Games out, I got it on 360. It was that relationship.
It doesn't warm my cockles in the way the Wii does, but it's a big part of my life. My 360 is still with me. It's right down by my feet right now with a copy of Ninja Blade inside there.
So, yeah, we're good mates.
You must be excited, Ash, with the Switch 2 that you now have some Nintendo hardware powerful enough to play some of these games on again.
Very good.
Tick that one off my list of jokes.
So, Dave, in the noughties, you were an energy drink guzzling scumbag yelling into an Xbox headset. What's your relationship with the 360?
You know what? That isn't actually that far from the truth because back by the time it came out, I was at university and I wasn't the one to get a 360. It was my flatmate who was also called Dave.
There was actually three day. We all lived together. We're all called Dave, actually.
That was weird. But yeah, my flatmate Dave got a 360. So, it was a lot of time huddled around his room playing Halo.
Yeah, just sort of like admiring it, doing a lot of pasta pad until we could afford to buy a second controller. I got a PS3 before I got 360 myself. And then after I left uni, there was one game that I think we can all agree was like the killer app for that generation that we all had to have.
And so I was like, okay, now I need to get an Xbox 360. And that was Ghostbusters, the video game. And I remember specifically buying a bundle, like a discounted bundle from Argos with Ghostbusters, a video game, because it really is Ghostbusters free.
If you ask the fan community, like that really is the true sequel to Ghostbusters 2.
Dave, is this why you suggested at the last minute that we have a licensed game category?
That may have something to do with it. I can't say. I couldn't say right now, we want to give my hand away.
But yeah, then the 360 became a big part of my gaming life. The thing is, it was kind of like bringing over a lot of PC games, and I was a big PC gamer before that as well. So you had games like Oblivion, later on you'd have ports of Minecraft, you had Counter-Strike coming onto it.
Obviously, the Orange Box as well is a big important title. So it became more part of the mid-generation, was when I really latched onto it. But then, yeah, I think that point anyway was like when it really started to ramp up with both the exclusives and the third-party titles anyway.
See, my memory is that Ghostbusters launched exclusively on PS3 in Europe due to some kind of like fire sale from the remains of whichever publisher died with that Ghostbusters game.
Oh yeah, didn't Sony publish it?
Yeah, I think that did happen, Dave. So maybe you're slightly misremembering, but you know.
Maybe, it did come out, it was on 360 though.
It was eventually, I think. Yeah, but it was this really weird situation where it might have just been in Europe, where it launched on PS3 first despite being ready on all these platforms. Really weird, odd days this generation.
Well, I will say, I used to, for financial reasons, I sold my PS3 and then I bought a 360 later on, and then I sold that, bought PS3, and then eventually I just had both. So yeah, there you go. I'll all peek into my struggling finances in my early 20s.
It's funny that, Ash, you mentioned that your 360 is still going. My 360 had the, I think it was the yellow ring of death I had. There were many rings of death, or at least like multiple ones, and it died, and then I sent it to Xbox to be repaired, and when it came back, it was the most, I would say the most durable console I've ever owned.
Other than the disk drive being fucked and having to use a two-pence coin to get the thing open pretty much every time I use it, which is definitely not ideal. The actual innards of it, it's really stood the test of time. That 360 was repaired in 2009, and 16 years later, it's still going.
Yeah, it went from the worst innards of a console to the best by the end of the generation for whatever reason. So yeah, just wanted to point that out. Matthew, any thoughts on trying to prepare for this drive?
What does the 360 mean for you? Just kind of recap that for Listus.
Yeah, I loved it. I had more of a kind of punter relationship with it, because obviously I was working on an NGamer at the time, but I did quite a bit of freelance for Xbox World 360. And 360 was the console that everyone at future games were certainly playing.
So if you wanted to play multiplayer, it would always be on 360. And the only console generation where I really did the online multiplayer thing, because that was just sort of such a robust ecosystem and the games were so strong. Yeah, I've got a lot of affection for it.
I actually went back and looked at the first 360 draft and was dismayed at some of my picks. I don't think I did a particularly good job at that time. You won it quite easily.
So I'm hoping to represent my tastes a bit better this time.
Yeah, that might be fun to recap actually for people, just to kind of like quick what we each picked last time. So, we had an Xbox Live category, I got Halo 3, Matthew got Battlefield Bad Company 2, XBLA category, Shadow Complex for me, Geometry Wars 2 for Matthew, FPS, COD 4 for me, Bioshock for Matthew, RPG, Mass Effect 2 for me, Witcher 2 for Matthew. One of those sevens, I picked Spec Ops the Line, Matthew picked Binary Domain, exclusive, I picked Fable 2, Matthew picked Crackdown, License Game, Matthew picked Arkham Asylum, I picked Arkham City.
Wait, other way around, sorry, yeah, other way around. Open World, I got GT4, Matthew got Red Dead Redemption, Wild Card, I got Mirror's Edge, and Matthew got Lost Odyssey. Free Pick, I got Bayonetta, Matthew got Gears of War 2.
I think your picks are pretty good there, Matthew. It's just, I think that, it's just that you got the other side of the coin on a couple of them, and those happen to be the key ones. So, yeah, it was actually not that far apart.
I got 57% of the vote, you got 43%, so. Yeah. Not a million miles away.
And, I mean, we are just not gonna end up with the same games this time, simply put, because we have different categories and two other people competing. So, yeah, it really could go a bunch of different ways. There's loads of games I didn't draft last time that I did want to draft.
Yeah, curious to see which ones come up this time.
Like what? Which ones?
Well, you'll find out, won't you, mate? So that's, have a bit of patience. Yeah, so should be a good one.
Yeah, excited to get into it. We've had a short preamble, but it's necessary because we have 44 picks coming after the break. So let's have a quick pause and we'll come back with the Xbox 360 Megadraft.
Welcome back to the podcast. So let's pick 44 games on Xbox 360. We're gonna discuss the categories a little bit first.
Just gonna read those out for you. So category one, first person shooter. Category two, RPG.
Category three, 90 plus on Metacritic. Category four, exclusive game. Category five, XBLA, so a download game from the console.
Category six, rhythm action, sport or racing. Category seven, open world. Category eight, horror or stealth.
Category nine, wild card. Category 10, free pick. Category 11, licensed game.
So pretty different to the last draft. And I think it will mix things up in an interesting way. Ash, how are you feeling about those categories?
I'm feeling pretty good. I've got an abundance of options in most of them. I think if you'd have given me like five options to pick an XBLA game, I'd be even happier.
Yeah, to be honest. Or just like five of the best games that were in Microsoft Game Room. That would be pretty good.
I don't even remember that.
Do you want to change?
What's Microsoft Game Room?
You don't remember Microsoft Game Room?
No.
That's where you took your avatar into a virtual arcade and then they would update it every few weeks with like new arcade games.
Yeah. Okay. I had forgotten that.
Is that something that they shuttered before the end of the generation? It's got the energy of that.
Yes.
Yeah, I thought so. Also, looking forward to Dave picking 1v100, another of the avatar games that came out around that time. I know some people really fucking like that, actually, that quiz show app.
That went down pretty well. Dave, how are you feeling about the categories? You suggested the licensed game one.
I did. What was you thinking?
Well, there's an abundance of them. I know you guys have Batman 1 and 2, as I'll call them last time, but I think there's just a huge amount here from various big IPs of the time. To use the Hollywood parlance.
But no, I think there's actually some really interesting licensed games that I don't want to give away. I've got a bit of a left field choice as well that I might just bring out. I'm quite excited about it, to be honest.
50 Cent Blood on the Sand, that's what Dave's pick in the first pick.
The thing is though, they used to, especially when I first joined Games TM, Ash used to just shovel shit in my direction, all over the place. I was always reviewing licensed games and I just learned to love them, with all their horrible...
Does anyone on this podcast believe that I had to force licensed games on them?
No, it doesn't sound right, Dave. It just sounds like he was like, oh yeah, he made me breathe the oxygen I breathe every day.
I was crying into my gruel.
Having already, because we already did the draft before, I didn't mind having an extra category thrown in the last minute. I think it's also an interesting category because it's a competitive one. A lot of these other categories have a massive abundance of stuff to choose from.
That's the sort of category that might come down a little bit faster in the options. So I think that was probably good for the overall mix. Matthew, how are you feeling about the new categories?
I'm into them. I think there's a few games that are quite hard to find a home for, which is kind of interesting. I think there's some games which sit across four or five categories, but there's a couple which only have a couple of homes.
I don't want to mention any names and give anyone any good ideas, but I'd say there's a couple of quite big Xbox series that you have to be quite careful with where you place them.
That's true. I think the main thing… We were talking about this before while Dave was sorting out his technical issues, but basically no third-person shooter is quite challenging.
No multiplayer is challenging as well, because in the last 360 drop we did, that covered a lot of stuff. So, yeah, you do have to be a bit more creative with how you get those in there. But I quite like that as well, because it just means you don't have unlimited capacity to be picking things.
There will be a bit of draft drama, which is definitely part of the fun. Yeah, okay, good. Well, we've been through the categories then, and I will say to the listeners that we're going to do the vote in Discord again.
It will be in the announcements channel. Just go in there and vote, and we'll tally up and talk about the winner in a future episode. And I will also make sure that the Patreon post that goes live in this episode at patreon.com/backpagepodwill be a public post.
You don't need to pay to read it. You can click on there and you'll be able to see all 44 picks in this episode. I'll keep track of it and then put it in there.
So you'll have all the information you need straight away when the episode goes live. I know that people like that to refer back to. So it should be good.
So this is a snake draft. And what that means is if you listen to the PS2 Redraft, it's a similar deal. It's like a four way coin toss, which the only man who can be trusted on this call Matthew Castle, will oversee to decide who goes first, second, third and fourth.
Whoever goes fourth, whoever's last to pick, picks twice in a row to balance it out. So, you basically go first, second, third, fourth and then it goes backwards. Fourth, third, second, first and then first picks again.
So, first and fourth players will normally pick twice at a time. So, it kind of balances out the order of it basically. I explain that in a really complicated way, but you know how it works.
It makes sense when you listen to it. So Matthew, coin toss, let's do it.
Let's spin the wheel of names.
Those famous spinning coin tosses.
It's spinning. Going first, Samuel.
I think this is the worst one to go first on. I was really hoping to go fourth on this one.
Going second is...
Fucking hell.
Dave!
Oh, I could tell if the gap was the dramatic effect, or if there was a technical difficulty.
I like to wait for the little cheers, so let's see who's going third.
It's me.
Love that guy.
So Ashley is fourth.
Oh, Ash, I think you might actually have the best position in this one. That puts you in a powerful position. First is the worst one, definitely.
Fuck, that's so annoying. Okay, all right. Guess I should do this, all right.
I'll swap with you, Sam.
First pick, then. First pick. Already.
Amazing. For category four exclusive, I will take Fable 2. There is only one game exactly like this, that is Xbox as fuck.
We have talked about this game on this podcast many, many times. I think it's one of the games that won me the draft last time. There are many Halo games on this system.
It will not surprise you to learn, but there is only one Fable, and therefore, well, it's not even true. There are three Fables. The only one that everyone could agree is actually good.
Basically took the combination RPG, life sim elements of the original, and then layered loads of interesting stuff on top of them, and the narrative, very ambitious, the idea of there being a big spoiler-alert time jump in the middle of the game, with the ages things along, including the family that you have in the game, really rich character customization options, lets you buy every building in the game. If you're a landlord sicko, it gives you that fantasy. But also just the kind of like, Pratchety, very British, but really kind of like, well thought out setting is just one of the most enduring video game settings.
You don't feel like you've seen it exactly before. And the promise of that, the new game from Playground coming out, is that you'll go back to this place that feels very warm, but also kind of spooky, scary and exciting, a great setting and pretty decent combat as well. You know, guess what, it looks blurry as fuck if you play it now, because it did at the time, and you've just forgotten how blurry it looked.
But I think that people's memories of this are super fond and for good reason. Matthew, I know you're fond of this game.
Yeah, the only game where you can aggressively shit your pants on cue, which is incredible. Hopefully this wasn't a pant shitter of a pic for you.
Very eloquently put. Ash, you got much of a relationship with this game?
I played the first one and I'm just sitting here thinking, you said there were three Fable games. Have I completely imagined a Kinect exclusive?
Every Fable game is on this platform. Five, actually, because there's pub games and XBLA as well.
Have I imagined a Kinect game where you have to draw a horse and cart? That's not a weird dream I had.
That's when he couldn't make Milo, so he turned Milo into a horse.
That's a pretty good Potter history. Just a great game. Dave, did you play much of this at the time?
Yeah, I did, actually. It was one of the first I got with the console. I agree with everything you said.
It's a classic. I think it's overlooked in the vastness of the RPG genre these days, but it's got bags of personality. I just love the charisma, the tone of it.
I'm actually a big fan of one, two, and three. I don't want to say I might pick it later, but I might prefer three slightly, but I know that's controversial.
They're definitely all of a piece in terms of like they're not, there's not a million miles between each one, but the setting changes in each one. Obviously, there's a bit of a step up in visuals and complexity between one and two. But that makes sense to me.
I like three as well. The reason I picked it for exclusive is basically what you say, like this is an RPG, but I think it's maybe not what people think of as an RPG on the 360, but that exclusive category felt a little bit more competitive to get one off the board to me than RPG because there are just so many of them. So that was my thinking there.
Yeah, okay, good stuff. Dave, what is your first pick?
I'm going to go with what I assumed everyone's first pick was going to be, because you said we can have it this time, right?
I did, yes.
So I'm going to go with, in 90 plus Metacritic, I'm going to go with The Orange Box, the incredible collection of games from Valve where you got Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Chapter 1, Half-Life 2, was it? Half-Life 2 Episode 1, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal and Team Fortress 2. I actually, and I listened to your last podcast, I am that guy who really likes Team Fortress 2, and I played it a lot on Xbox 360.
Things with Valve, everything they were doing at the time kind of felt like it had a touch of magic to it. So whether it was even them inventing a genre or refining a genre and sort of claiming it as their own, Team Fortress is a sort of class-based multiplayer game, just really hip for me. Like, just like excelling with one, with one class of character, just learning the rhythms of each map.
I just absolutely adored it. And obviously Portal is one of the best games of all time. Just this elaborate puzzle box with sort of bags of humor and personality to it, even though your character doesn't say a word.
I just, yeah, it's great. And Half-Life 2 is obviously one of the, is a masterpiece. So yeah, I don't know.
I don't know what else to say about those games. They're all fantastic. They're all 10 out of 10.
And getting 3.75 of them in one collection is just a no-brainer.
Well, you know, you've got basically vanilla Team Fortress 2 that no longer works, but the rest of them...
I'm not playing it anymore. I played it at the time, you know.
I think it's, I think it's, I do, I do, I should have said at the start of this draft actually, that unlike the last 360 draft, I did allow the Orange Box to be selected this time. I think in the course of history, I think of this slightly more as a PC thing, but definitely in the moment, it was a big deal on Xbox because Xbox got a reasonable port of these games, as opposed to PS3, which got an ass port of these games. So yeah, I think that's a good selection, Dave.
But it was like I was saying earlier in the pod, it was at that time where the Xbox 360 felt like a valid alternative to PC, like you were getting these core PC titles and franchises on a console, and that was really meaningful. It felt like a real turn of the tide. And this is like one of those titles that's representative of that.
Matthew, out of interest, would you have picked this first?
I actually wouldn't have, just for, you know, as we've said a few times before, I know that this is more about head picks and heart picks. I kind of admire it without really loving it.
How could you not love Portal and Half-Life?
No, but I think there's other things you could pick that are as good that I really like and I would probably prioritize those. I'm not going to pretend the orange box is shit or anything.
That's Sam's job.
It's like we said in the 2004 pod, Half-Life 2 is a game for IT guy psychos who don't like emotions. That's basically it.
I'm not sure that was one of our more popular podcast takes.
No, it didn't go down very well. Ash, did you think about picking this?
I certainly thought about picking this, yeah. It's got a special place in my heart, this game, because the first issue of Games TM I worked on as a staff writer had the Orange Box on the cover. I've only got fond memories of that.
Then when the review code came in, I didn't review it, but I smashed through the entire Half-Life 2 saga. I'd never played Half-Life 2 before, so that was a massive moment as someone who doesn't really deal with PCs, having all those games on 360 in my living room. As Dave said, magical, so great pick.
Yeah. As a fan of levels that go on for 20 minutes longer than they need to, I thought this is a great pick, Dave.
I'd always rely on you to find something to noodle at.
No, this is good. I think if it is down to cold, hard head picks in the vote and it may well be, I think this is a good selection on that basis.
I've got some beautiful emotional picks later, just for you. Don't worry about it.
Yeah, cold blops too. It will come up. Don't worry, mate.
It will be fine. Okay, Matthew, what's your first pick?
Four...
Hmm.
Oh, God. It's very stressful.
Already.
Yeah, I know. I know. Let's just get it in there because I think I fucked up with this last time.
Four exclusive. I'll go Halo 3.
Head has won out with Matthew Castle.
Head has won out, but I do like Halo 3. Halo isn't like a cornerstone of my personality, but I recognize it as being a great game and I recognize as Halo 3 containing probably the best versions of the Halo magic. Quite sandboxy, bombing around in vehicles, playing in co-op.
Yes, there's the level set inside like an ass, which sucks. But if we put that aside, I think when people think of Halo, they're probably now thinking of Halo 3 and it's like a magic they've not been able to return to. I think it's before it gets too lost up its own lore hole as well.
And just a great suite of multiplayer modes. Everything's in here. I can't see anyone arguing with it really.
Yeah, makes sense. Dave, do you play much Halo 3?
Yeah, this was one of those uni titles. So I played through the campaign with my uni mate late into the night while drinking beers. That's for me the quintessential Xbox 360 experience of my late teens, early 20s, wherever it landed.
Yeah, multiplayer was obviously fantastic as well. It was another defining multiplayer game of the generation. I didn't really muck around with Forge or anything, but also that was clear that was like a major evolution of it for fans.
But yeah, it's a great game. Good pick.
Ash, I'm going to guess you're not a Halo guy and we can move on to your first pick.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I am a Halo guy. I played hundreds, literally hundreds of hours of the original Halo. Like that was my uni game.
Damn, I'll take it back.
Sorry. Shared a room with one of my mates and we both had an Xbox and linked them together with a LAN cable. And that's what we did like literally every day after uni.
Halo 3, I haven't really played a lot of it, to be honest. I was more into another Halo game on the 360 that might come up later, but won't.
Fucking ODS-T pick, I mean, it would be a great gift for you.
Yes, I did prepare ODS-T.
I know your whole deal at this point, Ash. I've known you for 18 years, I know what your whole deal is.
I would have loved to have bigged up Halo 3 by like sorting the Halo Earth and trying to kind of paint ODS-T and reach some great failures, but I can't really do that in my heart of hearts.
Okay, Ash, what's your first pick?
Head pick for me, first of all.
Ninja Blade?
Do you know what? Ninja Blade is fucking awesome. For exclusive, I'm going to go for the other one, and it's Gears of War 1.
Oh, interesting. Okay.
Yeah, Gears of War 2 is probably a better game, but for me, Gears of War is the one where we all kind of sat up and took notice. Yeah, like, Halo was cool. Everyone was looking forward to Halo 3, but we'd had Halo 1 and 2 on Xbox.
It was a bit of a known quantity, whereas when Gears of War came along, it really felt like there had been nothing like it before. It took a little bit of inspiration from Japanese games, like Kill Switch and Resi 4, but then put them through that Western Unreal Tournament lens and created something really new and exciting. The curb stomping, the chainsaws through the head, the roadie run and dashing into cover, it all felt really kinetic, really exciting.
It captured that action movie feel that everyone was going for with the 360. I think personally, Gears of War won right game at the right time. You know, I'd only just started on Games TM.
So, you know, I was on a team of people who were all like super hyped about this game. So it's a little bit objective, but it's a little bit subjective as well for me. This pic, I just bloody love Gears of War.
It is great. And I thoroughly recommend the version of it on Xbox One that they did, the remaster, the anniversary edition. It looks fantastic and a great thing to sort of discover on your Xbox Series X.
There's loads of great just set pieces in there. I was just playing this the other day. And the preposterous bit where you're in that city where there are creatures that attack in the dark, but if you've got lights, you're protected.
And so you're pointing like a big searchlight at, I think, your pal Dom as he's like running across this like thing so he doesn't get attacked by these like sci-fi bats. Just preposterous that they wouldn't just have like more lights in the city that they're living in. But nonetheless, just lots of cool ideas to set pieces.
I really love this game. Anything to add Matthew, your big Gears guy?
I came to it much later. I might have picked Gears 2 over it just because it's got the bit where you go through the massive worm, which is quite good fun.
Yeah, it makes sense. Nonetheless, yeah, definitely a core 360 text just happened for you, Dave, Gears?
Yeah, I mean, Gears is Gears. It's another iconic franchise for Xbox. I agree with Matthew.
I go with a different Gears. Maybe, maybe like both the other two that are on 360. But you know, good pick.
I'm surprised you didn't talk about what the shoulder buttons did or something Ash for 10 minutes. Like, is there really anything around that?
Funnily enough, I didn't think I needed to explain Gears of War, but you know, we've got time.
I think the Kill Switch Resi thing was a very elegant discussion for how the Gears, I think, says Dave, who's just like, I think this is one of the most significant releases of FY06 for Microsoft. All right, Dom Matric, give it a rest. Okay, Ash, what's your next pick?
Oh, God, this is really tough because there's just so many to choose from.
I think I can guess what you're going to do.
Oh, can you?
Dark Souls. I think you're going to take Dark Souls.
It was that or something else. So I might as well take Dark Souls now. Yes, I'm going to take it.
Hopefully, this isn't controversial. I'm going to take it in RPG.
I think if you say FPS, that would have been controversial.
You can fire a bow and arrow in that person. But anyway, it's an action RPG as far as I'm concerned. I don't know where to begin with Dark Souls.
We all know what it is. I'm not going to explain it. I'll talk about my personal connection, which goes back to Demon's Souls on the PS3, which mad gonzo games journalist, John Shpaniak, told me about Demon's Souls when you could only get it in Asia and he convinced me to import it and then had to literally sit in my house and explain to me how to play this very, very strange game.
But after about eight hours of banging my head against a brick wall, everything clicked and I realized the genius of From Software, so I've been on board ever since. And as we know, Dark Souls took all those concepts and just refined and perfected them, took that weird Mario 64 hub world structure of Demon's Souls, threw it away and replaced it with this clockwork open world structure where the level design loops back on itself and is really rewarding to figure out. You know, along with, you know, everyone talks about the difficulty of Dark Souls and it is difficult, but also it's like, it's spectacular.
It's got an amazing world to explore. It's got giant bosses that feel like real big set pieces. Like it's got all of the things you want from a really like big budget, exciting arcade action game, but then wrapped in this very Japanese, very challenging mode of play.
But it's in many ways, it's still got that like larger than life, hey, you're playing 360 games now, experience to it. So there's a reason this game has stood the test of time and it's gone on to spawn like so many other great games. It's a classic.
Definitely allow it from you, Ash, because you're one of the original From Soft Sickos getting right behind Demon's Souls on GameStem. So I, you know, I respect it. Even if one of the unhappiest memories I have of the pandemic is being at the bottom of a pit in this game with Wes Fenlon, who was patiently trying to shepen me through it, and having the absolute worst time as someone was like hacking the game and just killing me over and over again while I couldn't escape this fucking dark pit.
It was awful. And then I gave up at Anne Orlando. Great times.
Dave, you're a Souls guy, right?
Yeah, I love this game. I've played it so many times. In fact, Dark Souls was the first Games TM cover that I worked on when I joined as a staff writer.
Just to... Nice. Yeah.
Beginning of the end for that magazine, wasn't it? You joined this team. Okay.
I don't even know what to say to that.
Prepare to die.
Well, you know, Jesus. But yes, I love this game as well. I agree with Ashley, like the scale of the podcast, and the secrets in it as well.
Cause there's like an early point where you climb up from your base camp and go behind the bridge. And then if you whack the dragon's tail, it drops off and you get the dragon sword early on. Just like little touches like that were just phenomenal.
And it just felt like a game that just had endless possibilities. And again, like, because as a games journalist, there's not like the whole guide system to make you aware of this stuff. There's just a lot of like chatter between people on text messages and stuff to sort of find out like, oh, you found this.
Oh, I found this. And like swapping tips and stories. And it felt like such a unique experience as a games journalist playing these games to sort of, yeah, to experience for the first time.
Yeah, in some ways, I think there's just too much chatter around these games now. And Ash, it's actually really good to hear. I think your take on it is like a thing to explore in this interesting genre hybrid and amazing things to see.
I think it's like it's the right wide-eyed way to look at this game. I do remember that dragon sword thing. Wes explained that to me.
I think, ultimately, the reason I gave up on the game is I couldn't upgrade that sword without some really elusive material that I had to backtrack miles to get or something.
It's like a dragon stone or something.
Yeah, exactly. I remember thinking, that is a cool secret and also my undoing. So that's good.
Matthew, I won't trouble you with any Dark Souls chatter and we'll simply move on to your next pick.
I will say, I'm just interested, like it's quite rare that FromSoft games get drafted by either of us. So it's quite like an untested thing in terms of like, what is its pull in the voting?
Well, Dave picked Bloodborne and almost won that PS4 draft off the back of it. So I think it will have some serious pull, but I don't know, it also runs at about 20 FPS on 360. So I don't think we'll hold that against it, but I guess we'll see.
Yeah, but no other game has a boss called Ceaseless Discharge. And for that, you've got to really up it in the rankings.
Yeah, I'm always looking that up on the NHS Direct website. So you've got to get that address one of these days. Matthew, what's your next pick?
I'm going to stick in RPG actually and take Mass Effect 2.
Solid.
Yeah, on the grounds of I think it speaks to quite a different crowd, to the Dark Souls people. It's probably the best example of this Bioware love affair people have with characters and party members. I'd say of all their individual games, I still think Mass Effect 2 is the one which has really got the juice, or the source.
Just one of the most improved sequels ever in terms of tightening up the mechanics, really nailing how that world is structured, how its stories are structured. I think the Suicide Squad sort of overarching mission of building this party and then taking them into this deadly mission if you first earn their loyalty is really, really elegantly done. I had a really great time with this.
Also just a great RPG that you can play in like 30 hours or something. It's really, really well judged and just what I was looking for. Much more my speed than any other RPG on the platform basically.
I picked it last time. I can't fault it. I always mean to replay this via the legendary collection but there's always new computer games to talk about, isn't there Matthew?
There's no excuse for it really. Last thing, which of you is more likely to have played Mass Effect 2? Dave, I feel like you would have played this.
Yeah. The opening level alone is just phenomenal. The jump to cinematic storytelling in Mass Effect 2 is such a huge leap.
But yeah, with the Normandy game destroyed in the beginning, it's just such an incredibly bombastic way to start the game. I loved it. And yeah, like I said, the bringing together your team, doing the final suicide mission.
I didn't get out. My team died. I lost.
But it was a really grand standing finale for that game. But yeah, I love it. It's great for shooter mechanics as well.
Yeah, I don't know what else to say. It's a great game. Martin, that guy who's the president in the West Wing, isn't it?
He's really good too. Martin Sheen, he is. Ash, we're going to jump in there.
And he said Martin Shaw.
Very different vibe.
That would be a very different elusive man.
That would be.
But not so elusive man, but in-your-face man.
He's doing Jiminy Glick.
Yeah, exactly. You could do Jiminy Glick as the elusive man. That's a great bit.
That's good.
I'm just laughing and thinking about it.
Yeah, it's good. Ash, any insights on Mass Effect 2? So I just automatically assumed you wouldn't have played this, but maybe you did.
Well, I haven't played it, but let me tell you why I haven't played it, despite absolutely loving Mass Effect 1. So Mass Effect 1, which I adored, I was commissioned by the lovely Jonathan Gordon, former editor of 360 Mag and former housemate of me. He asked me to write a review for 360 of Mass Effect 1.
I happily did that and I gave it five stars and I thought it was wonderful. But for some strange reason, John said to me, we don't just do reviews, we need to have some bonus content. So you can write a review, but you also need to write a guide of Mass Effect so that you need to append to the review a two-page guide on how the combat works.
Pick a level of the game and explain how to beat that level using the combat system. There's a lot of things I can do, but guides writer is not one of them. And I just took my best shot at this and muddled through it for 75 quid or whatever I was getting paid for that two-page guide.
And I did my best and I basically, I wrote down how I, Ashley Day, got through that particular battle. And then in order to fact check my guide, lovely former housemate of mine, Jonathan Gordon, sent that guide to Bioware and asked for their opinion. And they emailed him back and said, what the hell is this guy talking about?
That is absolutely the worst way to go about doing that battle. And you shouldn't recommend that your readers do it. And it kind of put me in a bit of a mood about Mass Effect.
I've never played the rest of the series.
Well, a few observations. First of all, John Gordon, the nicest man I imagine. All of us fucking sociopaths running around and there was just this nice man in plain sight while we were just doing all kinds of absolute nonsense in the early 2010s.
Good guy, John Gordon. Secondly, never ask a developer what they think of your content because they'll go absolutely weapons free with the red pen because they've got it in their head of how things work and blah, blah, blah. That was a mistake.
But also the idea that's ruined the entire series for you. That's amazing.
Yeah, I'm scarred.
Let's not blame the developer. Ashley's a terrible writer. So let's just all remember that before we start throwing shade of bioware.
I also love the idea as well of someone who... Because what if you games journalists listen to this? One man's only experience of guides writing and absolutely traumatized when some of the people who are updating fucking where to find Zerr this week, 85 weeks in a row are like, what?
The people who are in the trenches writing guides, I tip my hat to them. That is not easy.
No.
I've used a lot of those guides. Let me tell you, I can't write them, but I've used them. I doth my cap to those people.
Blueprints Tipwriters on Polygon, those guys have got my back, so I appreciate it. Okay, we come back around to you, Dave Scarborough.
What press release can I find off of...
Dance Central?
I did own that. I actually like that game. It was on my long list.
It's more like, because of things, there's such an abundance of great games, it's like, okay, which category do I want to go for? There's some categories where, even though my top choice is gone, even if my second choice went, my third choice is solid, so it's just sort of figuring out what's the most sort of vulnerable category to leave on the table.
Yeah, and some will just begin as well, and then they'll all be gone if you're not careful. It's tricky.
I think I'm going to go, I feel like this is a mistake. No, this is good, this is good. I'm gonna go for open world Red Dead Redemption.
Yeah, that's a solid pick.
Yeah, I think, like, that feels like, I know Matthew said last night, like if this was our mini console, that is one, Orange Box, Red Dead Redemption, those are two bangers straight away. This is, you know, Rockstar's love letter to the Wild West genre, to Cowboys. And as open worlds go, it's only really been bettered by its sequel in terms of the attention to detail and sort of throw you into that period setting.
It's quite talky, you know, in places. I have to say, I find the story less interesting in the world itself, but that's why it's a perfect choice for the open world category. Just sort of going from town to town, hog tying a bunch of people and dragging them out to a railroad.
Just like as a sort of like sandbox for your own mischief. It really is unique and just like, you could just lose dozens of hours in it. And if we're being kind and bundle in undead nightmare as well, I don't know if that counts.
You've got like one of the best DLCs of the generation during that weird sort of period where everyone had to have these massively expansive DLCs and undead nightmare. Throwing a bunch of zombies into this world was just this sort of like thrilling excursion to sort of jump into.
But yeah, it's great.
Like who doesn't want to ride around a horse and live their world west fantasies?
Significant and interesting that the open world category has now opened up because there's a few on the platform, but I can imagine that being a bit more of a gold rush now. Yeah, so that's interesting. Yep, great game and a game I was obsessed with on 360.
Matthew, any thoughts on this?
Some of my favorite films are the Spaghetti Westerns and having a game that's so sort of steeped in that atmosphere and trying to kind of put you in that place. Like, you know, I've said this before, I have some problems with the narrative maybe getting in the way and of just wanting to have kind of outlaw sort of fun in that game. And I think it wants you to play its very specific story and be impressed by it.
I personally just liked the stuff in between shooting people and watching them fall downstairs with those incredible physics or getting drunk and his mad stumbling around. And yeah, like Dave said, hogtieing people to the tracks. Just shooting train drivers and then robbing trains, all that kind of stuff was just, yeah, absolutely heavenly.
I felt like the slightly wonky shooting mechanics from GTA IV worked in the context of this as well. Like it didn't feel like it would be a refined thing, like with those old pistols and riding on horseback. So I really liked the combat in this as well.
I thought it had sort of the right gun feel to it.
Yeah, it's the bullet time as well, I think, just really makes it, gives you the time to kind of like have some fun and decide exactly how you want to shoot people and where you want to shoot them and yeah, it's a good game for sadists.
Yeah, interesting as well because I actually think it's quite hard to pick against because I think the GTAs on this platform split the vote a bit because I think you know in your heart if you're a GTA 4 person or a GTA 5 person, but if given the choice, most people would probably take Red Dead out of this category. So I do think on that basis, it's good strategic drafting, Dave. I will hand you that.
I'm doing the Leo Jango Unchained meme right now, you know, just small little glass.
Plus you're racist, right? So that's also part of the character that you embody quite well. Okay, on to me then for my next two picks.
Doesn't give me a chance to defend myself, just moves me on.
No, I'm only joking, Dave. Okay, two picks then. It's been 10 years since I last picked.
My children have all grown old and moved on. That's how long it's been.
It's been the time jump in Fable 2.
Yeah, that's very good. I'm in prison for all my crimes. Okay, gonna try something a bit different, I think.
You're gonna pick a good game.
I deserve that for calling you racist. Let me just double check what that got Metacritic before I start doing things. Okay, good.
I think I know what my play is gonna be here. So, for category 1 FPS, I'm gonna take Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. It's the defining Call of Duty on the platform, arguably the defining first-person shooter.
It had an amazing campaign, phenomenal Twitch multiplayer that I was terrible at, but still had a good time with, hugely influential, massive visual jump over the previous Call of Duties on the platform, just properly next-gen feeling thing, and also 60 FPS at the same time. A bunch of standout narrative moments that people remember from this game. We talked about all ghillied up plenty of times in this podcast, but also just the finale of this game, where a gun is slid to you along the ground, and you take out the main villain of the game, just great shit.
Really phenomenal use of the multiple perspectives in the campaign, switching between Brit SES guys and Americans who are doomed basically to be killed in a nuclear disaster. Spoiler alert. Just one of the best first person shooter campaigns ever.
The template for pretty much every COD going forward up till today. And yeah, like I say, multiplayer, hugely influential. Matthew, I know you played loads of this.
Probably my most played multiplayer shooter ever. I'm playing this with my friend Cyrus, trying to have a ludicrously high accuracy rating by only ever using a sniper rifle and like never firing in haste. I'd rather die than fire in haste to keep my accuracy rating high.
And playing that weird little kind of meta game with myself just made that one of my happiest 360 memories. I maybe prefer Modern Warfare 2's campaign.
Well, that is like nonsense, but that's because you like gunning down civilians in an airport, is that right? And they always wanted to do that in the game.
I like the Alcatraz stuff. I like the bit that's like the rock. That's fun.
I like, what's his name? Lance Henriksen in it, is the villain. And Kevin McKidd talking in that one.
That was good. Yeah, I like both of them. They're both really good.
I think a lot of people thought that 2 pushed it too far in terms of like the sort of like how preposterous the story really got in terms of like the double crossing and the scale of it.
But I think compared to like the later games, in the context of all Call of Duty, it's like the fricking thin red line or something is so down to earth.
Talk about an exaggeration, bloody hell. I believe they also cut Adrian Brody out of Call of Duty 2 as well, Matthew, so that's good. Okay, next up then, this is tough because again, I don't get to pick for 10 more years as I go back to jail.
My children will be 100 when I get out of jail. That's tough.
I'm looking forward to Ash's next pick so I can go to the toilet.
All right, let's do double FPS and take 90 plus on Metacritic. I'm going to take Halo Reach, which is one of my other favorite first-person shooter campaigns from this generation. A huge genre and I feel like you just need Halo in a 360 draft.
I probably marginally prefer that. I think actually I may have said this in the Halo episode we did. I think there are higher highs in Halo 3, but Halo Reach has the better overall campaign.
There's nothing like the two scarabs bit from Halo 3, which is the best moment of any game on Xbox 360. But there are loads of amazing self-contained levels, like the sense of doom that kind of like pervades this game. The feeling that you are losing at every turn, but watching like protagonists be picked off one by one and just knowing that the planet is falling to these alien invaders as you go, it just has a vibe to it that no other Halo game really does.
Halo game is much more hurrah. But there's just loads of great individual levels. I love the level where you're going between skyscrapers in a city that's being destroyed bit by bit across the course of the level.
You just see it getting more and more fucked up, basically, as you land in these areas and clear them out. And I think you're trying to rescue civilians. Just really has like scale and drama to it.
Fantastic little Star Fox space sequence with pretty superficial spaceship mechanics, but just really, really exciting to look at and to just basically for once do some like proper space battle stuff in a Halo game, which you don't get to see at any other point. But also just really good meat and potatoes on the ground design. Like this is a great narrative conceit to the end of this game, where you're meant to be the one who gets onto the ship to get off the planet, then you don't and then you're just left there and everyone's gone.
And then all you can do is like fight to the death. And it's just, that's like one of the great Xbox moments. And so I think I've got the two very different kinds of FPS, Halo Reach and COD 4.
So I think my logic there makes sense. What do you think Matthew?
Yeah, no, I get that. Weirdly, I think this is one of the, you know, of all the Halo things where they kind of pitched your investment in the fictional world of Halo, that it does kind of pay off dramatically and the gameplay manages to sort of dredge up, like you say, that sense of sort of doom, a doomed campaign and, you know, slightly more memorable characters who you're fighting alongside. Probably like the most, I would say, the most like narratively successful Halo, plus great action.
Firefight mode, I think that was in ODST as well, but that's a really, really great mode and building on that, you know, only results in good things. And you're right, you do have to have a Halo, I think.
Yeah, indeed.
You said with only one left on the board. No, two, sorry.
There's some good, all the Halos on the system, I think, are good. It's just, it's Halo's generation, but the two best ones have been picked, yes. Okay, next up then is Dave.
I just want to say, you know, Halo Reach had Zachary Levy in it, so, you know, there's no way you were going to miss an opportunity to pick it.
Well, obviously, my anti-vax views have nothing to do with this draft, Dave, so, you know, just leave those out of it, yeah?
It's also got our guy, and this is someone that Sam and I have a great deal of affection for, Greg Grunberg in it, so, you know.
Is he?
Yes, he's one of the troopers. It's got like a whole bunch of Whedon and JJ from Spiegel. Yeah, it's got a bunch of those guys in it.
Okay. I'm going to go. I'm opening up the board all over the place.
It's between two games. I can't tell which one to go for. Oh, I marked COD 4 as a game that I got on my list.
That's not correct. Wishful thinking. I think I'm going to go in Stealth Horror, Batman Arkham City.
Oh, fuck. He's messing around with license game. The category made us fucking do.
Oh, dear.
What a fucking swat. Worst person in the world.
This is the best Batman game ever made. It's one of the best games of the generation. It's just this incredible open world where you get to explore almost the complete history of Batman fighting his rogues gallery from that stupid ventriloquist all the way through to Hugo Strange.
And then you got the riddle of the side quests. It's fantastic. And yeah, I like flying around to Batman.
I played this. I remember previewing this at Warner Brothers offices in London in this. This was one of the weirdest journal experiences for me.
I was playing this in the London offices with Dax Jinn. I want to say his name was. He was like the PR guy or marketing guy, but he was he was also a spokesperson.
So he was quite like out there. And it was just me and him in this giant cinema. I've got a controller in my hand and it's on like a, you know, whatever, 60 foot screen or.
The experience being the journalist is when you get given a game for the first time, it takes you a good like 10, 15 minutes to sort of get used to the mechanics and how and how like the feel of it. And my job was trying to get a good understanding of how this game works and how to explore this city, which was, you know, just, you know, fast in comparison to Arkham Asylum. His job was to make me feel like I was the best Batman that ever existed.
And so I was literally just flailing around, constantly like gliding and then falling and getting beaten up by fugs. And he's sitting next to me going, oh my god, did you see what you just did? You are the Batman.
You are the Batman. Screaming in my ear constantly. And I'm just like, and like, it's a kind of pressure you just don't want to deal with.
So I'm just getting the shit kicked out of me. While this guy's like, you got a good hit in there. Oh, that's just like he would have, that's just Bruce Wayne.
That's what he would do.
If Batman Arkham City was published by EA, that guy would have been in the game, like literally commentating.
DJ Tomica.
John Madden.
Yeah, it's fantastic. And I've always loved these games for the secrets, for like, oh, if I put a bit of the explosive gel in this corner and blow up a wall, will it reveal something about the next game? Or will it give me sort of a secret trophy or whatever?
Like, it's just this, it's just this intricately designed sandbox for people to explore. And obviously I've picked this in stealth because you have to like hide a bunch on gargoyles and like grab a bunch of people with your batarangs, whack a bunch of people with batarangs or get your grappling hook and tie them up. And, you know, it's got so much going for it, both in terms of an action game, as a stealth game, as an open world game, and just as a Batman game, and just being sort of fan service.
And, yeah, I just love it.
I would go out of my way to praise this, but you fucked us on categories, Dave, so you can go swivel, frankly. But I will say that they made this in two years, between this and Arkham Asylum. I mean, in two years, and it was eight years, wait, it was nine years between Suicide Squad and Arkham City.
I mean, I'm sure they crunched a lot to get that done in two years, but god damn, yeah, amazing generation for Rocksteady. So, okay.
I like that bit where you go to the Monarch Theatre and it does like this really solemn, like slow-mo and your music swells as you mourn Bruce Wayne's parents, you know, it's really affected me. While the guy next to me shouted, that's why Bruce Wayne knew who he is. He's just so, his parents died, man, and now you're the Batman.
You're so good at grieving.
I know George Clooney was your favorite Batman as well, Dave.
I was vindicated in The Flash.
Matthew, what is your next pick?
For 90 plus on Metacritic, I'm going to take Portal 2.
Love this game.
Which, yeah, I know obviously the orange box is out there. I would say I enjoyed Portal 2 more than any individual part of that. I think it's the strongest of their first-person, puzzle-y, story kind of games.
Obviously, anchored on incredible performance from Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and then…
JK. Simmons.
Well, there's JK. Simmons and whoever voices GLaDOS.
Ellen MacLean.
A trio of amazing performances. Building on the Portal mechanic with some, you know, amazing new mechanics. The Propulsion Gel and the Repulsion Gel jumping around, flying around those areas.
There are often bits in this where I felt like I was sort of nibbling at small parts of a puzzle. And it's only when it all comes together and it ends up sort of firing you across a giant chamber and you realize just sort of like how brilliantly Valve have played you and managed to get you exactly where you need to be. It's a really kind of crazy piece of satisfying puzzle design, but also these, you know, almost like cinematic sort of punchlines and payoffs to things.
Yeah, really, really good stuff. Also a great co-op mode on this as well. A little co-op campaign where you play as two of the little robots.
So yeah, just a really good all round package.
Solid pick and yeah, it's some of the best voice performances ever, like you say. Dave, you've already got one portal, Dave. You don't need another one.
I know. I'm in an iron about picking this on last go. I love this game.
I went to Valve's offices to review this back in, was it 2011 it came out? 2010? Yeah.
One of the weirdest experiences because they're on several floors of Valve and they were like, we're going to give you a tour. And so you have a tour and it's like a completely empty level of the office. And then it's like, okay, now like, yeah, they just finished making Left 4 Dead 2 in here.
So they're all on another floor working on a different game. So, okay, go to the next floor. And this is the Portal 2 floor.
They've finished this game. So they're now on another level. So, okay.
And that's the end of your tour. You're not allowed to see any of the other levels, but you can come and see Gabe's office. So we all walk over to Gabe's office and it's full of knives.
And he's not there. And he's like, oh, Gabe's got like three offices. He doesn't use this one anymore.
And that's the end of your tour. And it was literally just a bunch of empty offices with, and I only saw one piece of concept art for Left 4 Dead 2, and that was it. But aside from all that, Portal 2 was one of the best games we've ever played.
And the co-op, I think, is vastly underrated when it comes to multiplayer games of the era. It was one of the most fun experiences I've had playing a game with someone else.
That sounds like a very Valve tour, to be honest. Like, here it is, we've not planned it, but it's sure happening. That's like very Valve, I think.
So I appreciate your anecdote, Dave. Ashley, this sounds like a game where you would appreciate the design of it.
I once called this the secret best Zelda game. And Luke Albage on Games DM, I think, threatened to punch me for it. That's not true, by the way.
He didn't threaten to punch me, but he was very annoyed. It's a beautiful game. I contributed to this being a 90 plus on Metacritic.
So you can thank me for that, Dave. I gave it a 10 out of 10 for X360 magazine. I just, I thought it was literally perfect, to be honest.
I think the thing I admired the most about it is the way they managed to take those puzzle mechanics that work so well in Portal and that everyone kind of assumed would only work in like a small four-hour self-contained mini experience and to like blow those out and make them last over the length of a full FPS campaign to weave an actually genuinely good story into that, a world that you want to explore without losing the integrity and the ingenuity of those puzzles. It cannot have been very easy for Valve to develop at all. It must have taken so much time, so many ideas kind of scrapped and redone to get where they were.
Just a beautiful, beautiful thing, I think.
Yeah, definitely the sort of the contrast between the shiny test chambers and the aperture, the company in it. They're kind of like, yeah, disheveled and abandoned offices. Yeah, amazing stuff.
I love this game. It's really good. Okay, cool.
That's a good pick. Then we come back to you, Ash, for two more picks.
Yeah, it's been forever and you bastards have taken a bunch of my choices. Thank you for that. I've got a dwindling supply of first-person shooters left that I've actually played.
That might be where I need to go.
You can pretend Far Cry 2 is good. People did it all the time back in 2008.
Yeah, I could pretend I've played Far Cry 2. Do you know what? I might go for licensed game.
Seems a bit early, but I'm kind of-
Well, no, it's not because they've ruined it.
Yeah, I'm not picking an inferior Batman game. Arkham City is the best one, so I'm not picking either of the others. I'm going to pick The Beatles' Rock Band in terms of this game, which will mean I'm going to have to talk about The Beatles.
Up until the point I played this game when I was probably about, I don't know, 28 years old, if anyone asked me what I thought of The Beatles, I'd be like, oh, they're overrated. I can see why they were good for the 60s. I was just completely the wrong generation for The Beatles.
Then I played The Beatles' rock band. I was like, oh, holy shit. They were amazing.
All it took was for this fantastic harmonics produced video game to contextualize them. For me, to have you play that music yourself and feel that evolution through their story of how the music develops, and for it to be presented to you in an almost like synesthesia sort of way where they're giving you these psychedelic visuals as you play and making you feel like you're almost part of The Beatles' own imagination as you're playing, like a true audiovisual experience. Obviously, I loved rock band, like everyone does.
Who's written LOL in the tracker?
It must be, I think it was the Ringo star of this draft, Dave Scarborough.
I remember Ash saying to me that his favourite Beatles album was the best of The Beatles.
Okay, well, that's completely thrown us off.
Yeah, it has. Thanks for that, Dave. Clearly, I should have just picked Ghostbusters here, too.
Instead, I went with an actual great video game that more people should play. The Beatles Rock Band, the last thing I'll say on it is it's completely lost the time, isn't it? It's not on any subsequent platforms.
It's never coming out again. I don't think I even own a copy anymore. It's this beautiful thing that people just aren't really going to play anymore, and they should.
I think of that era of like plastic instrument games, it's probably the one that's most deserving of some kind of quote unquote preservation now, because it's the one that has never been bettered and should never be bettered because you can't, they're not going to make any more Beatles albums, so this is it.
They should bring it out as a movie tie-in for the upcoming films.
If I have to watch Barry Keegan pretend to be John Lennon, I can at least give me this game back to make up for that atrocity.
Barry Keegan is Ringo.
Oh, is he? Sorry, I got that mixed up. Who's Lennon again?
Harris Dickinson is John Lennon.
What a load of old shit that is. That whole thing is garbage.
Listeners, don't let these opinions taint your vote.
No, no, no.
That's too soon, Sam, because that's going to be our London Film Festival experience next year, because we're going to watch all four of them back to back.
Great. Then go have some Southern Fried Chicken or whatever it is we go to have in that place. Yeah, I love the Beatles Rock Band.
This is like the good version of Beatles Nostalgia, along with about 75% of that Get Back documentary that's not the 25% of them sat around, and that Austin Powers looking guy writing down music for Paul McCartney, as discussed many times in this podcast. Yeah, the way he uses visuals is great, and it's sort of like, it's not like tacky boomer nostalgia, it's actually like legitimately great. You know, it's artistically done, and you just, yeah, there's like really smart creatives behind it.
It just feels very authentic and not cynical. I think it's a good pick, Ash, and maybe not the most obvious licensed game pick, but it was in my shortlist, so it makes sense. Matthew, I know you're a fan of this too.
Again, I kind of came to the Beatles quite late, so yeah, I completely get that. I don't think the game unlocked it for me necessarily. I think it was actually a someone and a gamer burning a load of CDs for me.
But yes, it's a powerful moment to have in the game.
Your next pick, Ash.
Okay, 90 plus on Metacritic. I'm going to pick one of my favorite games in my favorite genre, and it is XCOM Enemy Unknown.
I did not see that coming this early, I'll be honest.
Maybe I've jumped the gun, maybe no one else was going to steal this, but I've got to have it in my list. This is possibly the 360 game I played the most, I absolutely adored it, and I probably played it the most because it's brutally hard, and I just spent all my time retrying the opening levels. But how do I contextualize this game?
I think this, along with Fire Emblem Awakening, which came a year or so afterwards, I think really opened a lot of people's eyes to why tactical strategy games are so much fun to play. So I think it's a really important game, and look where we are now, where strategy games are coming out of our ears, and it feels like a lot of people loved them in a way they didn't before then. A really tightly wound clockwork game, very kind of board gamey design, where every single mechanic intersects with another, to just make the perfect game.
I'm speaking hyperbole a lot here, and that's because I don't really want to sit and explain the mechanics of X-Com here, nobody wants that. I think it's one of the finest examples to this day of that genre, and deeply rewarding to play, not just in the tactical combat, but the way it intersects with the base building and the resource management, like hopping between the tactical combat and that base building is, you know, if you're only good at one of those things and not both of them, you're going to lose quicker than you ordinarily would. So it's a really kind of challenging and cerebral game that rewards like repeated plays.
It's kind of what great games should be, in my opinion. And that's why it got 90% Metacritic, I reckon.
Yeah, I love this game. I think this is actually more potent if you played on console than on PC because there was nothing else like it on console at that time. And now there is, as Ash points out, there are loads of games like this, you know, all games are built on these foundations.
There's about to be a Star Wars one revealed, which was teased today as we're recording this.
Oh, I didn't know about that.
I didn't hear about that.
Well, it's not XCOM, but it's by former Foraxis Devs, a studio called BitReactor. I don't know how XCOM it is, but I've heard very good things about that studio. So I think it's a good pick, but I do also wonder if Matthew or Dave would have even taken it.
Probably not, but that's nothing to do with the game. I'm more just knowing our audience and what they respond to.
That's interesting. I guess we'll see. Dave, I don't think you would have picked this.
No, it's very SamCore, though. I'm sure you're sort of slightly reading from it because, yeah, you love this game. I played it.
I did play it. I enjoyed it, but I'm more of a Marion Rabbids guy. That's my zone.
Yeah, I think I had it under the same category, but yeah, it's quite hard to slot it elsewhere. Yeah, otherwise it would take up a free pick or I'd be trying to pretend it's a wild card and let's face it, that's just not gonna fly. Okay, we come back then to Matthew.
For FPS, this is history repeating, I don't think it worked for me last time, but screw it. For FPS I'm gonna take Bioshock, which I know is the actual shooting bit of it isn't necessarily what people love about this game. It's definitely not what people love about this game, but in terms of games played from a first person perspective, I can't think of many that were more immersive or exciting to me.
The opening 15 minutes of this, the descent into Rapture, is just one of my top all time gaming memories. Certainly a defining 360 memory. Yes, exploring this world, discovering the stories, hidden away on all those audio tapes.
Lots of things which feel quite kind of cliche and played out now, once upon a time seemed incredibly exciting. And I think if you forget how overexposed some of these tricks are now, I think you can still acknowledge Bioshock is one of the greats and not even I sort of felt like it might have even been a disappointment at the time because they talked such a big game or Ken Levine always talked such a big game in terms of like, oh, the ecosystem of this city is going to kind of blow you away. And what it really boiled down to was big daddies will fight anything or things are scared of them.
And, you know, I think if you kind of put all that aside, it's still just worked really, really well, you know, one of the all time gaming locations. And I don't think the series was ever quite as sort of neat as this again. So I think this is still the right pick.
Yeah, it's a tricky one because it's not a straight FPS. I would say like in the way that like Halo is, right? But it's this or another category where it's a bit awkward.
So it already like blocks out other stuff you might want to pick. So I get that. And yeah, I'm obviously very fond of this game.
I'm actually surprised it took this long to come up because even though it would release on PS3, this was the, this is, when I remember 2007 in the rush of 360 games, there's Halo 3, Orange Box, Mass Effect, this. This is the game I remember as being like the I've never seen that before game, you know? So yeah, that's still how I remember it.
I just remember it. I imagine people were just so, so into it. So that's a good pick, Matthew.
Makes sense. All right, it comes back around to our friend Dave Scarborough.
Yeah, Bioshock was on my list. I like that game a lot. I'm surprised that they didn't do like more anthology sequels.
I don't know if Judas is gonna end up being, being sort of tied into it, but that's what I kind of liked about Infinite's ending is sort of like teased the idea of this being this, this sort of multiverse of, of different stories in different locations. But anyway, good choice. What do I pick?
What do I pick? What do I pick? What do I pick?
Hmm. I'm going to go in RPG Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. I think it's like for this generation, it is the defining RPG, I would say.
If you think about it, like every single, like there was this period of time of, I would say about five years where every game that was open world that came after it, an RPG that came after it was compared to Skyrim in terms of map size and depth. It was like, here's this game's map and we're going to overlap it with the Skyrim map just to give you a sense of how big it is because Skyrim just really set the template of what RPGs and open worlds should be and could be that generation. It's sort of been memed to the point of irrelevance at this point, the whole, you see that mountain over there, you can climb it, but genuinely at the time that was really amazing and I did climb that mountain and you get to the top and you learn some new dragon shout and like it was this really rewarding gameplay moment and then there just be like a dragon just tucked around the corner and you have this sort of risk reward of am I going to try and take down the dragon because you take down the dragon, you know, it levels you up.
It just create this world that felt very dynamic and very alive, not least because of all the characters in there, the fact, you know, you had underground stuff as well, caves to explore, bunkers. And yeah, I just think there's a reason it's sort of endured as long as it has, a reason why it's been re-released on every console since it originally came out. It's just sort of the best of its class and Elder Scrolls 6 has obviously a lot to live up to because of its legacy.
Yeah, it's definitely a defining RPG on the system. It's also like the only, one of the only examples that I can think of where you can see, you feel like you get a next-gen leap in the middle of the generation because the gulf between this and Oblivion graphically, it does almost look like it's gone up a console generation somehow, and there is like a five-year gap there, and obviously they make Fallout 3 in between. So yeah, hugely significant and an amazing spectacle even if you're not massively into the universe, which I would say is how I would describe my experience with it.
Also, I just could say like one of hands down the best E3 demos I've ever seen. I think everyone knows about the E3 demo by now, but they showed you a bunch of the mechanics. They showed you the opening, then you'd get a little tour around.
What's the first town called? Winter?
Something Run?
Is that right?
White Run?
I think it's called like Winter or Snowbat. Everything's got some winter tinge name.
Anyway, sounds like you can't remember many details about this game that you apparently love, Dave, isn't that?
I can't remember the name of the town, so sue me. Chachi PT doesn't go into that much depth. It's a joke, it's a joke, I mean it was Chachi PT.
But no, but in the E3 demo, there was this bit about halfway through it where you're just walking along next to some mammoths and then a dragon comes along and just picks one up and then the giants start fighting with the dragon and it's like the guy who's presenting is like, oh my god, we had no idea that was going to happen. This is just the work.
Was it the same guy who demoed Batman to you?
I was going to say something here of PR men shouting at me about how great the game is. I'm looking at it. But yeah, everyone got that same demo.
They re-ran that demo like a thousand times during E3 and it happened at the same time. But the impact of it was still not lost on me. It was super cool.
Matthew, you're going to jump in actually when I was talking about Scarborough.
No, I was just saying that I agree with you. I don't necessarily feel the world. As an amazing technical feat it is, it always comes unstuck for me when I'm like dealing with any person in this world.
I find there's a real kind of animatronic quality to them. I know people meme the repeating sound lines and maybe it's unreasonable to expect hundreds of NPCs to all have distinct voices and distinct lines and things, but for me that stuff really shatters the illusion. It's probably the biggest reason why I've always struggled with this.
I don't have the same problem with Fallout for some reason. I don't, you know, just the tone of it works a bit better, but this I've, I can just never buy into it. It's always been a bit of a no from me.
Matthew, did it come unstuck for you when you realised the dragon was voiced by Charles Martinet?
It's me, Parthenax.
I could enjoy it the same way after that. Okay, good stuff.
Thanks for dunking on my game chaps.
It's like, I think it's a head pick, not a heart pick. And so, them's the breaks. I actually think that Mass Effect 2 is the defining 360 RPG, not to give Matthew too much credit.
But I just think that maybe it's just because it's a little bit closer to a shooter as well as an RPG. Like, it triggers down.
And also Miranda's bum.
Very important for Chuck Watchers of the time. Too much Zachary Levi in this episode, actually. So let's disregard me saying that.
Okay, it comes back around to me. 400 years have passed. I'm Dr. Manhattan-ing on Mars.
It's been so long since I fucking picked in this draft. Bit of cold pragmatism, I think, do here. So for category 11 licensed game, I will be taking Batman Arkham Asylum.
I'm going to bet on people looking at this and City and not being able to decide which one they like more. This was the first attempt at this in a war. Isolated location, and I think maybe people have a lot of fondness for it based on that because it's been so long since there was a good Batman game.
Here this arrived fully formed with its free flow combat system and that mix of stealth and action and exploration. It's very Bioshock infused, finite setting, needlessly stylish mental health care facility, and arguably the right number of Batman villains doesn't overdo it. Maybe doesn't totally stick the landing where you get to some of the bigger enemies later in the game, but also features the scarecrow moments which are some of the best bits of or most memorable bits of video game storytelling in history, and at the time was just a total amazing surprise and a gut punch.
I think there's a reason that this still overpowers the others in people's memories a little bit, even if I love all three games in the series. Matthew, what do you think?
I actually think the enclosed nature of the environment means it feels more like a traditional 3D Metroidvania where City definitely has lots of chunks of that, but the general scale of the thing means it is a little baggier if that's the part of the game you enjoy. You know, I'd actually say it's kind of probably like between this and Metroid Prime in terms of the going back to locations with new abilities and then scraping off another layer to discover more secrets. Also just great use of the Batman lore and characters and you know, yes some of the bosses don't land, but again finding the audio tapes and hearing little snippets from these, you know, very recognisable characters is really exciting.
I thought this was just, I thought this was going to be duff and it was so good when it came out. I was amazed that they did it as well as they did.
It had really bad box art. I think like when you looked at it, if you had no understanding of the game, you just looked at the box art, you're just kind of like, oh, this looks, I think you said in the last 360 draft, like at the time when The Dark Knight was out, you look at this and it just felt very off brand, very market, still Batman, but the game is, yeah, fantastic.
Okay, good stuff. I've got another pic. Ashley didn't ask Ash, do you like Arkham Asylum, Ash?
Do you have a good time with that?
I mean, you know that I adore Batman. This is a great Batman game. It's a little bit like Batman, Metroid Prime, but not really, but it's got that sense of immersive exploration, much more compact than the later games.
And that makes it, I think, interesting and worthy of revisiting.
Why are you all pretending it's a better game than C? C is vastly better. It has everything that the first one has, plus good boss battles and a massive open world.
But you didn't pick it in License Game, did you, Dave?
I would say, because you picked it in Stealth, if I would say Arkham Asylum is a better Stealth game.
Oh, well, that might be true. But Sam didn't pick it in Stealth, he picked it in License Game, so here we are.
I mean, you're the one who, anyway, don't stoop to his level. This is like, if this is how you engage with your children, Dave, I mean, you know, it's not how I engage with my children, it's how I engage with all children. Okay then, next pick.
Again, a bit of cold hard pragmatism. Gonna take Grand Theft Auto V for open world game. An amazing end to the generation.
End of 2013, here's what we can do, here's everything we can do, putting out all the stops with this system. It's just giving you the full fat GTA experience who are arguably denied with GTA IV and its beautiful city and slightly divisive, but, you know, emotionally engaging story, I would say, I'm very fond of GTA IV, but GTA V is a bit more of that San Andreas Vice City spirit of, hey, there's an army base here, what if you just nicked a fucking jet and flew off? And then just this is an incredible city to explore.
GTA V has lingered far too long in the cultural memory to be appreciated in the same way anymore, because we've all had that one city to explore for 12 years, and we're all sick of it and want GTA VI to come out. I caveat that, but I will say at the moment, in that moment, even on Xbox 360, this was lightning in a bottle. I can't believe they've done this.
An amazing, ambitious, multi-character GTA, maybe the story is not your kind of thing tonally, but the missions are extraordinarily drawn in terms of how high scale they get, particularly the heist in the game, which take a bit of buildup. They are pretty linear missions ultimately, but I think they really have the stuff when it comes to action pacing, and they get it right in terms of difficulty as well. GTA was always notoriously quite fiddly.
GTA V, the shooting takes a big step forward, driving takes a big step forward. It's all pretty much best in class, and there's a reason it's been so phenomenally successful. Dave, what do you think of that pick?
I love it. I love GTA V. I've completed twice, I think, at this point, and I play a lot of online.
I know you play a lot of online as well. I think because online has become such a juggernaut, you almost forget that it was such a huge step forward for these types of games, having this second life as online titles, and just keeping that relevant and just fun. It takes two hours to load into any mission, but once you're in there with a bunch of people, stealing planes, doing heists, exploring the map, and just doing random shit in the sandbox, it's kind of unparalleled, good time Friday night gaming.
And yeah, I've had some great nights playing GTA V.
Yep, I think it's fair to take this in 360. I know it's been released everywhere at this point, but this is the first place everyone played it, basically. So, okay, good.
We come back to Dave, is that right? Yes, Dave.
Yeah, it's me, Dave. I'm gonna go in racing sports music.
It's a catchphrase.
Yeah, racing sports music. I'm gonna take Trials Evolution.
Oh, interesting.
This is one of the most fun couch multiplayer games I've ever played. The way the game feels, how you'd be able to throw a dirt bike around, the inventiveness of each map and each course, and the way it sort of tests you and tests your patience and tests your sort of thumb, and like your dexterity and able to sort of traverse its various jumps and obstacles and stuff. And then like throwing in, like, I think there's like, similar to GTA V, spending an evening having a few beers, playing this game with friends is just like an incredible experience.
The first time I played this was at an Xbox preview event out in San Francisco, and it was very much like putting us in that frame of mind. Towards the end of the evening, they allowed us to sort of have beers, sit on a sofa and play Trials Evolution. And it's sort of the lasting memory of that event, apart from Peter Molyneux presenting Fable The Journey in horrendous fashion to us.
But apart from that, Trials Evolution just really stood out and it was an XBLA game, probably one of the best, but also one of the most fun sports titles, or probably the least serious sports title I could have picked out of my long list. But in terms of fun factor, it's up there.
Yeah, it didn't really happen for me this game, but I remember this being like a genuine XBLA phenomenon. Matthew, Ash, any reflections on this one?
If you had Jason Killingsworth of Edge Magazine on your friend list, this game is basically watching his ghost vanish into the distance and then make you feel terrible about yourself.
Oh, that's right. You had to...
I didn't play much of it.
I remember John Denton playing this a lot in The Office. Did you, Ash, play this much?
No, I didn't. I used to watch other people playing it. Maybe it was John.
And it kind of looks like I can have a bit of a temper. And this looked like the kind of game that would be infuriating to me because it's got that, like, those mechanics where if you make one little mistake, you like have to restart and keep trying and keep trying. It was one of those games where like an instant restart, right?
Have I got that right?
Yeah, you could press a button and then you could restart a course, yeah.
Yeah, and I think I would have kind of got caught in a kind of, like, Tom Cruise in a sci-fi movie. No one can remember the name of. Loop of, like, constantly restarting and driving myself insane.
So I wisely stayed away from it, but it looked great.
I don't know if this series still exists because it got bought by Ubisoft. And then I don't know if they, like, just make bits of Assassin's Creed now or something. But yeah, I think it's been a while since they released one.
But okay, I look forward to seeing what deranged strategy you have, Dave, to picking this, not in next BLA. But I won't interrogate it now and simply move on to Matthew's next pick.
I feel like a couple of categories have sort of lost or there's so much noise in them already. I feel like I can't make necessarily a huge dent. So in horror or stealth, I'm going to take Dishonored 1.
Oh, fuck, that's a great pick. I don't even think of that as an Xbox game, but of course it is.
I was thinking about picking this and thinking, well, people are going to kind of lay into it and say, you know, Dishonored 2 is just so much the bigger game because you've got both Emily and Corvo, the two different characters, two completely different parts. But while Dishonored is about these supernatural abilities and how you weave them together, and so having more of those abilities and more interesting abilities does result in a more interesting game, the other half of it is about locations and levels and missions and the very specific places you go to. So I don't think Dishonored 1 is overwritten by Dishonored 2 for that reason.
You know, obviously Dishonored 2 takes you to Karnaca, this is all in Dunwall and you really get to kind of explore it inside and out. I think if you've got levels where people can kind of remember the name of them, that's often a good sign and people often talk about Lady Boyle's last party, you know, almost a kind of sort of hitman level as you walk around it and try and engineer the death of these bastards who've kind of, you know, you're out to bring down. I love that there are these like narrative solutions to the levels where you can like non-lethally remove someone from the equation.
If you can work out the kind of story behind the level. So much of what is amazing about Arkane is in this game and you've got to play it if you're going to play the whole Dishonored Project. This is still a really key game.
Good for first person stealth as well, like really well done. There's quite a few good games like this on 360 but this is the one I enjoyed the most.
Yeah, I think about Arkane games as they're mechanically perfect and this game is no exception. I agree that there's like a drop off in the second half of this game for sure. But all the kind of individual assassination missions and the run up to that are just perfect.
Definitely some of the best memories of the 360 for me as well. Lady Ball's Last Party is like one of those things where if an entire game was that, if they were like, it's 25 pounds and it's just one rad level, I think people would still really like Dishonored, you know what I mean? So that's always a good sign, I think.
Okay, yeah, that's a good pick. Why don't you? I didn't even fucking think of that.
That's going to do my head in. I forgot about that. Ashley, you watch with Dishonored guy?
Never played it. I don't even have an interesting anecdote about being shamed by another journalist or anything like that. I have nothing to say.
I'm very sorry. That's my mom.
Dave, don't we have a bet that you've got to finish Dishonored 2 and then you owe me 10 pounds if you don't finish it? That must have been 10 years ago we made that bet now. Do you owe me 10 quid?
We didn't put a time limit on it, so it's actually 20 quid.
Is that with inflation?
That's with Trump's tariffs. Yeah, no, it's 20 quid if I finish Dishonored 2. I have played Dishonored 2, but I didn't play much of it.
Dishonored 2, I have played even less of, and I will get to it one day. They look great.
Okay. Well, once again, I've praised Matthew's picks for him, which is ridiculous drafting. I should have said it's shit, but I failed.
Good DLC for this game as well. Okay, Ash, back to you for two picks.
All right. I think I'll go Horror or Stealth as well, and I think I will go for Resident Evil 5.
Oh, I thought you were going to say 6. I was so excited.
Well, it's on the short list. Who knows? It might be a world card.
Yeah. Resident Evil 5, despite its problematic tone, let's say, which I think was, I want to say it was unintentional.
I'll go with that.
You know, the beat.
Sure.
Yeah, I think so. The beating heart of this game is just, you know, a supremely well-honed Capcom action game that, you know, the way Capcom were doing very, very well in the 360 era. It took a lot of what was great about Resident Evil 4 and really amped up the action movie feel, added co-op to Resident Evil, which I don't think anyone had imagined would happen, but in that post-Gears of War world, it actually made like a ton of sense.
It's memetastic as well. It's got Chris Redfield punching a boulder famously. It's got characters shouting, give me an egg, in co-op and Mercenaries mode.
Fantastic Mercenaries mode. As you often get with Mercenaries modes, like a really beautiful score attack arcade game hidden within a survival horror, and this time with co-op and online multiplayer as well. In subsequent years, it's kind of become a little bit of a forgotten Resident Evil game.
It hasn't had its remake yet. It may never have its remake, because I think that would be quite a difficult thing to do for a few reasons.
Didn't it also get retconned by the Resi 4 remake? Isn't the AIDA ending different to the original game? I think that might be a thing.
Be that as it may, I think this is a fantastic game. I think they pushed the action about as far as Resident Evil fans were really willing to accept. And then from there, they found various different ways to walk it back a little bit.
But as Capcom action games go, it's up there. I had a great time with it. I played through the entire campaign in co-op.
Slightly biased, Capcom flew me out to their studio so I could preview it. So it's all mixed up for me in these once in a lifetime memories of visiting the Capcom offices.
Plus, like the game You Are Racist, right?
It's actually my favourite video game of all time because it's got politics aligned with mine. Yeah, let's go with that.
Yeah, a huge Resi 5 fan. The Mercenaries mode in this is an all-timer. I don't know why I wasn't going to pick this because maybe I feel like I've talked about it just too many times in this podcast.
But yeah, I think that it was actually probably the... I mean, the Dragon's Dogma fans might disagree. I actually think this is kind of the best game Capcom makes this generation.
It's a really mixed Capcom generation. It's sort of all over the place. The DMC they don't make, I'm not counting that there, but their own sort of games are muddled as they try and keep up with Western games and morph their games around Western games.
And I think that to really mixed effects and obviously where we're at now with Capcom is a much better place. They just make games with their own sort of influences and sort of gameplay styles and don't try to imitate anyone else because they are the best. They don't need to.
So yeah, I really love this game. It's even if you like, even if the setting definitely reverses into some problematic content, it's quite visually distinctive as a Rezzy game goes. Just the idea of setting it in Africa and the kind of settings they take you to color palette wise.
Very, very different to how Rezzy would look before this and after this. So yeah, Forgotten, I think is actually a good way to put it. I think as the years go on, it kind of is, Ash, that makes sense.
All right, it comes back around to you again, Ash. Sorry, you got two picks.
I've only got one FPS left on my list because all the rest have been taken. I'll save that for some fun and games later on. Do you know what?
Just because you said that this was the best game Capcom made this generation, I'm going to go with free pick and give you the counter argument to that with Street Fighter 4.
Oh, of course. Yeah. Sorry, I never really think about Street Fighter as a thing, but please carry on.
No, I know you guys are not big Street Fighter heads or fighting game fans, are you? No. You know, it was hard to be a fighting game fan, imagine, because you had a couple of people there who were like absolute devils.
You know, Luke Albusier and Sam Bander could like just destroy anyone at Street Fighter and it made it like spectacularly unfun. Yeah. I want to say.
Ryan King and Sam Smith as well were exactly the same.
Yeah. But you know, like Street Fighter, you know, going all the way back to Street Fighter 2, like you play that with someone of equal skill and the fantastic mechanics of the fighting game will come through. Like no matter how good or bad you are, if you're equally matched, you're going to find a really fantastic game in there.
So there's a reason Street Fighter 2 is one of the best of all time. And I mentioned Street Fighter 2 a lot here because that's kind of what Street Fighter 4 was all about. After 3 went very, very hardcore and then the series was largely absent for many, many years.
This was the big comeback for Street Fighter and it really, you know, they brought the entire Street Fighter 2 cast back. They were really trying to recapture what was great about that classic game. But with a next-gen lick of paint or the bells and whistles and lots of modern mechanics, it's really got the balance right between accessibility and depth, in my opinion.
It had a couple of iterations on 360 that did Super Street Fighter 4, that did Arcade Edition, but much like some of the other entries on here, where I've gone with the first iteration, I can't really get away from how special and exciting this felt. To have one of my favourite game series come back in such a big way, just to have it announced was an amazing thing, but then to have it announced and turn out to be so incredibly well made, felt like a miracle in some ways. And in terms of fond memories, I remember Capcom invited a bunch of journalists to their UK office to go and do a hands-on preview of the game, and I've never been to a hands-on preview quite like this.
Often, when you go to these things, it's done one of two ways. Either there's loads of machines in a row on long tables, and you're all sat at these tables, not really talking to other people, or you get a private appointment, and it's you and the PR manager chatting away while you play it and get the measure of it. This was one machine in a tiny little office, and probably about 40 games journalists, all crammed into this office, all doing, taking turns, winner stays on, the way you would have played with your mates at home.
Paul Davies, editor of 1990s CVG magazine, was somehow there and had somehow come out of retirement. Just to see Street Fighter 4, every single games journalist who loved Street Fighter had descended on this room, and it felt like, as a games journalist at the time, it felt like a moment. It really encapsulated how special it felt for Street Fighter 4 to come back.
And since that moment, I've been playing a version of Street Fighter consistently ever since. I'm still as shit now as I was in 2008, but having a great time.
Yeah, definitely a huge moment for fighting games this generation, just suddenly coming back as a cultural force, and this one very much felt like the spearhead of it. I won't pretend to know anything more than that, though, about it. Dave, do you play a bunch of this?
No, I'm not a big fighting games guy. If I play a fighting game apart from Smash Brothers, which I love, I usually try to find the cheesiest character, and then just try and annoy the other people I'm playing against, pretty much because of what Ash said, like, any imagine offices between Ryan, Al Bajay, Sam Smith, Banda. It was really hard to sort of get into that genre in any meaningful way, because they've just wiped the floor of you, like, within seconds, and, you know, they didn't hold your hand or anything.
So I just kind of bounced off of a lot of the fighting games of this generation.
It sure looked nice anyway. Okay, well, I'm sure there will be a few people who are hardcore into this in the Discord who will vote for you on this basis, Ash. We come back around to Matthew Castle.
Going to take Open World. I was really tempted by Grand Theft Auto IV, because I think it does have a character of its own and by being an urban location and that particular combination of characters and that particular combination of radio stations have been playing a little bit in preparation for our revisiting these games later in the year. And you are reminded like, oh, this still has its place just because it isn't this huge open landmass of five.
But I think just for the sake of variety and ticking a few more Xboxy boxes, I'm actually gonna take crackdown for this one.
Yeah, makes sense. I thought about this too.
It's a very different kind of open world game. I'd say it's, of all the games that are likely to be mentioned for this category, it's the one where the, you know, the literal openness of the world pretty plays the most into the gameplay in that you're sort of throwing yourself around. It's not about simulating a city.
It's not about realism. It's about the city as a background, the city as a playpen for this amazing power arc. As you collect these different orbs by performing different abilities, you become kind of charged up in those abilities.
So you know, you start off as just a little person on the ground shooting and smacking people around, but by the end, you're jumping entire city blocks. You're climbing up the huge tower in the middle for that famous achievement everyone wants at the top. And just that kind of, I guess, quite arcade-y sort of reinterpretation of what an open world city could be and how it could behave and the kind of game that could take place there.
I think it's still sort of like one of a kind. Like there's a bit of it in other superhero games. But very rarely is a game just about conquering this city in this sense, just for the sake of conquering it, rather than as a backdrop for a more traditional action game.
So yeah, very, very cool. Even if everyone did this by it to get the Halo demo, but whatever.
Yeah, I think it makes sense as a exclusive pick. Dave, any reflections on this one?
Never played it. Soz?
Ash?
He's gone to the toilet.
I'm back from the toilet. Thanks for dobbling me in, Dave.
Well, I didn't know you'd be back in time.
No, I've never played it, but I did watch a aforementioned former housemate, John Gordon, playing this jumping up and down buildings and having a great time. He seemed to play it for about 18 months of my life. So I think he liked it.
Yeah, fair enough. Certainly endured as an Xbox series, even if they never quite got the magic back.
It's never been right since.
I thought the second one was pretty good, but it's not something I'd pick in the draft. The second one felt like an expansion for the first one rather than a new game. Had its moments though.
Next up then is Dave again.
Does Minecraft count as an XBLA game? Because it was XBLA originally and then it got a physical release after.
Let's see, does it pass the test? It does pass the test. It's quite a good hack, Xbox 360 edition.
What limits does that give you? So you don't get Minecraft forever, you get basically quite a limited version of Minecraft, right?
It's limited in some sense, yes.
Dave, is this just because you want to talk about the film?
I saw the film and I want to put it out there on the record. It's fun.
I knew it.
You've all seen your fucking letterbox reviews, Dave. I mean, give it a rest, mate.
We've all seen you opening fireworks in the cinema during the screening.
People clapped at the end of my screening. Like, what a cinematic achievement it has to be for people to clap at the end of a movie when the credits roll. And it was adults clapping as well.
Like, children don't clap.
I don't personally think that base game Minecraft is that appealing, an XBLA pick, but go off, Queen.
I don't understand why you would say that. The base game Minecraft experience is the fundamental Minecraft experience, and this is why it's my pick for XBLA, because the sandbox, the tools it gave players to just create and to explore. Like, whether you're playing creative or survival mode, it is just this groundbreaking experience where it unlocked like a whole generation.
It's sort of these creative gaming experiences. I can't say that I am the best creator within Minecraft or with any of these types of games. I can just about use your red blocks and create like a cool track and maybe like a little roller coaster and a little humble home.
But the fact that it felt like there was so much possibility to it, the fact that I still played this game and again, maybe not the 360 version, but I still play Minecraft to stay with my kids and to see them just really opening up and exploring their own creativity within the game in a very simple way is phenomenal and I think its impact is unparalleled. And this was sort of the time period where it happened, where it coalesced, where the experience became something that really struck a chord with people. And yeah, like I've got many fond memories playing them.
I have more fond memories now playing it with my kids who constantly are showing me houses or they use creative mode and put a bunch of animals to attack each other together against eye golems and all sorts of shit. And I saw the movie and I laughed a lot because it was pretty funny. So yeah, Minecraft is my XBLA pick.
Okay, a bit of a sort of shrug from me on that one, Doug. Anything to add, Matthew?
Remember, people, you're not voting for the movie, you're just voting for the game.
Exactly.
I'm not even interested in the game you play now. You know, just a two generations ago Minecraft. Does that sound appealing to you?
Minecraft, it's just not for me. It's not something I'm interested in at all, apart from as a general phenomenon, but it's not something I'd want to play. But I wish you well.
Good luck.
It sure happened, that pick. Okay, next up then. Back to me for two more picks.
Again, 10,000 years have passed. I've been downloaded onto a hard drive, my brain, because I've been deceased that long.
Your James Marston's son avenged his father in the draft, who was deceased years earlier.
Just a Horizon audio log.
That's a good analogy. Okay, interesting now because I feel like I grabbed from a lot of the more competitive categories. I feel like I should get something else that's very Xboxy in the bank.
So for Wildcard, I'm going to take what Matthew picked last time, take Lost Odyssey, something very different that doesn't really have a point of comparison on the system. Japanese RPG, if you're excited about Clear Obscure Expedition 33 which is out next week, then this is very much one of the games that inspired it. Has a little bit of the Mario RPG, tap buttons in time with attacks to amplify the damage that you're doing.
But also was the good Mist Walker RPG on Xbox. Blue Dragon was not. Definitely more in the Final Fantasy mold, but has some beautiful bits of pros, punctuating lots of great RPG action.
Definitely some sort of like slightly dated voice acting, I would say, in this game. But I think this, a lot to a lot of people, this is the defining Final Fantasy shaped experience on this platform and indeed of this generation because FFXIII is a bit of a divisive game as we know. But Xbox as fuck and has definitely like had a cult reputation in the build up almost instantly out of this game, but certainly in the years since you can play it, I think for free on Xbox Series X.
So yeah, it is much beloved. Did I hear Ash muttering then? Were you going to pick it Ash?
I had this down in a bunch of categories. I think it's an incredible video game. Easily the best Final Fantasy of the generation, I would say.
And yeah, you kind of skipped over it a little bit there, but the pros that you would get every now and then was exceptional quality. Like it was, I know Matthew's a big book guy, so I don't want to shame myself, but I would say for me, I would say book quality. Like for me to sit and just stare at my TV and read, the writing itself has to be really, really engaging.
Reading something on a television versus reading it on a book, it's a stretch, it's an effort, and you're doing it within the context of a video game, where you want to be pressing buttons and enjoying action. I think it speaks volumes of the game, that it grabs your attention, and you want to sit down and engage with the text, literally the text, and helps that. I think it had a really interesting narrative to it about this guy.
Is he 1,000 years old, the main character in Lost Odyssey? Yeah. So there's a lot of musing about what that might actually be like.
What might it be like if you lived for 1,000 years and all your friends are dead? It gets quite dark, but for me it really explored themes of mortality and loss. It's got a fantastic funeral scene.
I'm also not a big story guy when it comes to games, but every now and then a game with a great story will come along and this one did it for me. So yeah, really annoyed Sam. I think this is a great pick.
Okay, good. Well, I'm glad to hear that because I don't need to hear Dave's perspective on this one because I know he's not a Japanese RPG guy. Matthew, you picked this last time.
Did you think about picking it again?
Yeah, it was definitely in the list. I didn't know if it moved the needle last time. I think it's one of those games when people have actually played it.
They know that it's really, really legit and, you know, both as a as a JRPG and also this like literary element of it. I'm pretty sure the short stories in it are translated by the translator who usually does Murakami's books. So it's like a proper literary exercise.
You know, it's it's like legit stuff. Yeah, it's cool. It's a cool thing.
And I don't know if they ever collected those bits of prose into like a book or something. It feels like something they probably did at some point. But Matthew, it did make me think about one of my favorite observations of yours ever on this podcast, which was when we were talking about Revenge of the Sith and you talked about the bits written by Tom Stoppard versus the bits written by George Lucas, where like characters IQ just halved between scenes.
It's sort of like there's a tiny bit of that with this, where the writing goes from like phenomenal in those bits of prose to like basically dumbass JRPG dialogue, so I fully copped to that being part of the mix here.
Ah, the old Stoppard drop, as we call it.
Yeah, but this is a very cool game. The combat is great in this and yeah, Uematsu soundtrack, I believe, so significant. Okay, my next pick then.
I've still got another one here. Oh, tricky because again, got going to be another hundred years before I get to pick. Am I going to repeat a pick from last time here?
I think I am. Category 10, free pick, let's take Bayonetta.
Oh, shit.
Which, of course, is arguably the premier character action, as Ash put it, game on the system. The launch of this series, it only ran well on Xbox at launch. It didn't run well on PS3, but it was, you know, it was Kameer coming back to this genre that he basically created, translating something from kind of like 2D arcade games into 3D with the original Death May Cry and then picking up again in the wake of Devil May Cry 3, which was excellent on PS2, but he wasn't involved in and kind of reclaiming the crown with this iconic, what the hell do I make of her main character, which is kind of how I think everyone felt about Bayonetta at the time, but a character that I think is, people are very fond of and not just for perverse reasons, although there's definitely a bit of that in there.
A tiny bit, a tiny bit gentler than Devil May Cry because you have the little, when you dodge at perfect moment, you kind of get that like few seconds to kind of like recompose yourself in the middle of combat. But this game was also rammed, of course, with lots of fun Sega and Capcom references, great afterburner bits and space harrier bits in this game. Just really imaginative.
I know in this podcast before we debated a bit whether this is better or Bayonetta 2 when Matthew's having a COVID hallucination is better, but that's been litigated multiple times by now. But certainly in the moment, just wow, this is amazing and there's nothing else like it on Xbox 360, which is exactly how it felt when it came out here in early 22, maybe it's 2009 actually, I can't remember now, maybe it's 2010. Yeah, I suppose Ash, we'll start with you.
Oh, God. I'm going to struggle to put into words how I feel about Bayonetta. It's a lovely game, isn't it?
What strikes me about Bayonetta, now that so many years have passed, it's been like 16 years, I keep meeting what I would call normal people in the games industry, people who work in finance or digital marketing or this sort of thing. I don't want to pigeonhole people, but people who, they like video games, but they're not hardcore, they're not going to come on a podcast and talk about the 360 for four hours. But I keep encountering normal people who absolutely love Bayonetta.
I think that's really interesting. It's anecdotal of course, but there's something about the character that really like drags people in to the game. And then something about the game design itself that is way more accessible than you would think for something that's made by Platinum Games.
I think that's kind of the beauty of Bayonetta is that it's designed so that anyone can enjoy a hardcore Japanese action game. And then of course, the people who really, really love hardcore Japanese action games can spend the time kind of noodling around with combos and frame counting and all that stuff and counterattacks and they can get so good at it that it just is impressive to watch them play. So all the accolades for Bayonetta I think are really well deserved.
Yeah, great, great set of kind of like weapons that they stack into this as well and alternating sort of like in real time between them this, your sort of little loadouts of melee weapons that you unlock slowly as you play the game. Just really, really well judged. Yeah, Matthew, were you thinking of picking this?
Yeah, it was the top of my free pick list. So yeah, that's annoying.
Still vanquish, pal. You can still grab vanquish.
Yeah, I just don't like it as much.
Fair enough. Dave, you're a pervert. Do you like Bayonetta?
I do, but it was one of those games to me that was sort of a little lost on me because, as you know, these sort of ultra-stylized Japanese action games, there's so much skill involved and I'm so unskillful as a player that I can often feel quite pathetic at it. But I really like this. I preferred Bayonetta 2, ultimately, I've really got into that a little bit more, but yeah, this is a good game.
Fly Me To The Moon versus, what's the one? Moon River.
Moon River.
That version of Moon River in 2 is amazing. I will give Bayonetta 2 that for sure.
Okay, Dave, next pick.
I feel like it's a fun point in the draft now where there's a lot of hard stuff you can go with, but it can also be kind of still strategic.
There's still loads of great games left, that's the thing.
Yeah, yeah.
It's just, it feels like the foot's off the gas, but I don't know.
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna stick it on Platinum Games. I'm gonna go Vanquish in my free pick. Shinji Mikami's take on the third person shooter.
It's kind of like Gears of War and Rocketskates.
They're just sliding into robots, blasting them, chucking cigarettes around. It's just got so much style. The pacing's relentless.
I remember at the time, there was like a big thing about games, like how long they were. I think that kind of bled into the next generation a little bit too. Whereas now I quite like short, like quite tight, short, repeatable experiences.
And this is exactly what it was, because you get to a level, you also get, you know, you want to go back, replay it, try and improve your stats. And then, yeah, it just had this like intensity combat. It was constantly sort of pushing you to do better.
The world itself was just this like crazy, techno futuristic cityscape that you kind of like explored. There's that level on the train, where, yeah, you're just like, on this like roller coaster going around. Like, there's just so much to it.
It's frenetic.
It's a blast from start to finish. I don't know. I really like this.
I admit I played it a long, long time ago, so my memory's still hazy on some of the details, but I enjoyed it.
Exploring, firing cigarettes? I had no idea what you're talking about, mate. But this is a new game.
You get cigarettes in each level, don't you?
You can throw cigarettes to draw the laser targets.
Oh, right. I don't remember that. So there you go.
I take it back. You don't explore, though. It's definitely just like corridors you go down.
But it's a nice setting.
Well, that's what I mean. I'm in this setting. I'm just being a dick, Dave.
I know you are. You always do. You pick apart my spotty memory.
But anyway, I'm just trying to be eloquent and failing with games that I have a fake memory of. But anyway, it's a great game. It's one of the defining Platinum titles for sure.
You kind of stand shoulder to shoulder with Bayonetta. And yeah, I think it's cool to have something like this on my list.
Yeah, when we did the Platinum Hall of Fame, we basically realized how much of it happens almost straight away. And then never again. It's like kind of they start at a peak and then sort of it dips really.
But I preferred this to Gears at the time. I think Gears has probably got technically better shooting. But the movement in this is just such a such a plus to me is so much more my kind of game design.
Ashley, do you like this game?
Oh, yeah, it's amazing. Shinji Mikami is the king. Maybe not the best Mikami game on the 360.
That might be Shadows of the Damned. I'm joking. Vanquish is amazing.
Super, super fast sliding around on your knees like some kind of robot rock star with a gun. It's just it's what Platinum did well, right? Like making making action feel good and just taking one or two mechanics.
Like you're kind of one of those games where you are doing the same thing over and over again for about 12 hours. And somehow that doesn't get boring. I think that's really cool.
Yeah, it's also one of those games that I don't think would look any better if you made it now. It's just such a confident, futuristic art style. Play on PC, the unlock framerate just looks amazing.
So yeah, okay. We come back to you, Matthew.
I'm really torn on rhythm, action, sport or racing, because none of the things I could come up with, I'm massively in love with, though I recognize that they're brilliant. Mine's been very single player focused. So just to liven things up, and it may be slightly diminished in light of Ash's Beatles rock band.
I'm going to take Rock Band 3.
Hmm, interesting. Is that the one with the piano?
Yeah. I'm really… I'm picking it for the quite crude reason that, yes, it also has the piano, so it has like another string to its bow.
Rock Band, when it added the little drum kit, seemed like the most exciting thing in the world and dominated lots of parties. No one was rich enough to be able to afford Rock Band at future, but there was like one review kit in the office that would sometimes make its way out to someone's house party. I think we actually hired a room in the cork to play it a couple of times.
Vague memories of that. I can't really speak to the music mix, you know, I'm not like very, very far from an authority on Rock music, but you know, I know it had stuff I liked. I think there was that, this is to prove my point, there's that Queens of the Stone Age song that's quite jolly in this.
Is that the one?
Yes, that's the one. But then it also has like Bohemian Rhapsody and sort of karaoke classics that everyone can enjoy. I know the whole concept of this is a mini console, kind of went out the window many, many drafts ago and we don't tend to talk about it in that concept.
But I like the idea of buying this weird console that also comes with guitars, drums and a keyboard so that you can play this. I think it might be my only really serious multiplayer game on here. But yeah, everyone can have a little bang away on these things.
Absolute Criminal is no Randy Newman songs for the keyboard, but what can you do?
Classic. Yeah, okay. I think that's good counter-programming if you're going down the rhythm action route in this category.
Okay, it comes back around to Ash for two picks.
Right, okay. I think I've still got Open World to go and I'm going to go Fallout 3.
Oh, interesting.
Oh, I wasn't even thinking along those terms.
No, I mean Fallout 3 is a lot of things, right? It's an RPG, it's an FPS, if you want to play it that way, but it is also an open world. And I think the world is a massive part of the game's appeal, right?
Like, in many ways, Fallout is a survival game, and you're surviving against the elements of this world, the horrors, the mutants, the radiation. Like, there are parts of the world where it will kill you just to stand there, or you might be dying of thirst, and you have to make this horrible choice. Like, do I drink this irradiated water and die of radiation sickness, or do I avoid it and die of thirst?
What a delicious choice to make in a game. You know, it starts off with you possibly deciding to set off a nuclear bomb and blow up, permanently destroy one of the best parts of the open world. You spend the later parts of the game kind of traversing the open world with an army and a giant robot.
Like, it's what a mad game Fallout 3 is, like all the stuff that it packed into that world and all the secrets to discover and the vaults. It was the first Fallout game I'd played. I can only imagine what it must have been like to go from Fallout 2 to Fallout 3.
Like, it just blew the doors off. Felt like a bit of a revelation on Games TM. I remember Rick Porter gave it a 10 out of 10.
It's not the sort of game I traditionally would have looked at, but I had to take notice when he gave it that score. And I'm so glad he did, because the Fallout games are now one of my favorite series ever.
I thought that I think the open world in this is fantastic, actually, even if I do think of it as an RPG. It's interesting that no one's picked in Assassin's Creed in this draft, although it's the one draft where maybe Assassin's Creed 2 might get drafted.
It could still get picked.
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, interesting pick, bit of counter-programming there. I think we've all picked open world now.
I think Saints Row III would have been a great counter-pick to some of these picks as well. Yeah, that's me talking about a different game than Ash. Sorry, that's rude.
Yep, good pick. One of the best games of the generation. Amazing, just the managing to make a post-apocalyptic game not look ugly as fuck, like the picking the right kind of greenish color palette for it and just really distinctive kind of shapes across the horizon that kind of like grab your eye and amazing little kind of self-contained quests in those places.
Our Fallout 3 is an absolute all-timer. I love it. Another pick from you, Ash.
Like Matthew, I think rhythm, action, sport or racing is a pretty tricky category. I've got three racing games on my list. One is basically another version of a game I picked on the last draft.
So I think I'll avoid that one. And I'm going to go instead for split second velocity.
Oh, that was on my short list as well.
This was kind of in the mold of the Burnout games. And I absolutely loved Burnout 2 and Burnout 3 and a little bit Burnout Revenge. Wasn't a big fan of Burnout Paradise.
And I just didn't really feel the open world structure worked for that particular game. Many people will disagree with me. So I was delighted when it was Disney Interactive Studios made split second.
I think it was a lot of the Burnout team ended up making split second. It was kind of like picking up the baton and going, right, we're going to take what criteria we're doing in those Burnout games and we're going to take it to the next level. One of its kind of core selling points was that you could trigger environmental disasters as you went around the tracks.
Obviously in the Burnout games, a lot of it was about either avoiding or enjoying these spectacular crashes, but in split second that spectacle was taken to the next level. The one that always sticks in my mind is this commercial airliner just dropping out of the sky and creating havoc that you then have to drive through at high speed and navigate. I love arcade racing games and I think this is a brilliant example of an arcade racing game, one that just feels kind of thrilling to play and also crucially to replay.
You might think some of those triggered disasters get a bit repetitive once you've seen them a few times, but I didn't feel that way at all. I felt like they were something to look forward to and enjoy over and over again.
It's one of the first games I played when I got an Xbox One, actually, because I'd never played it at the time. I thought I always wanted to see all the big set pieces in it because the game is definitely divided up into smaller things you can do, like barrels that blow up and send people flying, and then the signature big set pieces where a plane crashes or whatever. It definitely delivers on those big set pieces.
Dave, Matthew, did you play this game?
I did, but only for a... I had to capture it for an Xbox On video and it was incredibly stressful trying to get the bit of capture without really knowing the game that well. So I just associate this with mainlining the campaign for five seconds of capture.
Not the best way of experiencing something. But certainly very flashy and fun.
Yeah. Okay. Matthew, is your next pick?
I don't know what the winning pick is in XBLA because I'd say there's lots of very solid things that mean a lot to different people. I'm going to take Fez. I can't remember what I took last time.
Geometry Wars you took last time.
That's my big heart pick. The pacifism mode in the mode where you go through the gates. I think it was called pacifism in Geometry Wars 2 is some of the most fun I had on 360.
But I just don't think people are necessarily as into it. I don't know that they're particularly into Fez either, which of course is the 2D platformer that reveals itself as a 3D world that you kind of rotate to solve increasingly mind bending puzzles. It was like the first wave of those galaxy brain puzzlers of which there are many more now.
Like I'd say between this and Braid, there was the you can get through the basic game and then you have the, you know, there's all the mad sort of meta stuff which people drill into and code breaking and stuff the community has to come together to solve. There is more and more of that stuff like right now obviously blueprints I think taps into a similar kind of thing. That sort of obsessive idea of is there always another layer to this game and, you know, that was all fun but I think even if you just connect with this game on the 2D, 3D spinning mechanic I thought was really, really well done.
Had a lovely chiptune themed soundtrack. Not before those things were done to death but before that kind of general aesthetic became just so well known and used in so many different places. It just seemed very kind of creative and interesting.
Key player in the indie rice to sort of power and glory I guess.
Yeah, that's a rock solid pick. Definitely one of the best reviewed games of the time. And yeah, definitely in that sort of early 2010s period of people saying you've got to play these fucking tiny games that cost 10 quid and they'll change your life.
Makes sense to me. Okay, cool. Good pick.
All right, it's back to Dave.
Yeah. I think I've just got all bangers left to be honest. Like heavy hit after heavy hit after heavy hit.
So I don't think anyone's going to pick any of the other games that I've got on my list at this point. So I kind of have my freedom of the board. I sound so cocky, don't I?
I should play that down. So I'm going to go with the one I think's at most risk of someone being a dick and trying to steal off me. Choosing License Game, I'm going with Ghostbusters, the video game.
Okay. If you say so, pal.
Yeah. You could have tried to steal off me just to be a dick. I know no one wanted it, but that's your mistake.
Because if you're a Ghostbuster, and I can turn my camera on and I can share in the Discord my background because, hey, look, I'm going to do this for the purposes of everyone here.
It's an audio call, isn't it? Oh yeah, there it is.
Yeah, there you go.
Look, my Stay Pufts. And over here, my other wall of Stay Pufts, my Stay Puft poster.
Serial killer shit, mate, that is.
I've got my PKE meter.
What's more sinister, Gabe's wall of knives or his wall of Stay Pufts?
I've showed an array of props from the movie Ghostbusters. I have my trap that cost me several hundred pounds.
We're now seeing Dave's Egon Spangler love pillow.
I have a proton pack down here, which you can't see. So that's my collection. Ghostbusters is such a meaningful movie to me.
And there have been many, many, many Ghostbusters games over the years, and only a handful of them have been anywhere near good. The original Ghostbusters, which Ash I'm sure will correct me if I'm wrong. Who developed that?
Oh shit.
It was Activision.
It was Activision, wasn't it? Yeah. It was phenomenal.
That was just like a real retro standout, like first Ghostbusters game. And then new Ghostbusters 2 by Howlabs is fantastic. You can play two Ghostbusters characters at once, including Louis Tully and explore the movie.
Fantastic. But between that, between the Ghostbusters 2 in the 90s and where we are now, there hasn't been another great Ghostbusters game until Ghostbusters, a video game, which reunited the original cast. So you have Bill Murray, Howldreamers, Dan Aykroyd and, oh my gosh, I forgot Winston Smith.
That's so funny.
Oh, no! What the heck happened?
That's so funny. This is the best bit of the podcast.
Ernie Hudson. Jesus Christ. I don't know why that slipped my mind.
You know why? Because I'm looking at the poster next to me, which has all their names on it, and his name is famously isn't on the poster, so it just slipped my mind.
Oh, dear.
What's great about Dan Aykroyd and Howldreamers worked on the script with the developers. It is quite fan-servicey. It returns to a lot of the locations from the first film.
So you go back to the Segwit Hotel, you bust in Slimer again, who's escaped. It's the return of Gozer. But the importance of this game to the Ghostbusters lore, it explores a lot of the stuff behind Gozer's origins and sort of stuff that actually plays into Ghostbusters Afterlife that came later.
It's really interesting if you're obsessive like myself, you get to have a fight on top of a building against Stapuff Marshmallow Man, which is an absolute standout set piece. The feel, the gun feel, taking essentially Gears of War and making a Ghostbusters game out of it, a cover shooter and having the sound and the feel of the proton pack was really, really well done. It had a few different modes as well you can play with.
There was the slime canisters from Ghostbusters 2. It had a couple of other modes as well, which are also in my Ghostbusters proton pack prop here. You can change it to those modes.
It felt like a genuinely authentic Ghostbusters experience. It was made with love with the developers and with the cast itself. And genuinely until Ghostbusters Afterlife came out, a movie which I love and I'm one of the few, it didn't feel like we would ever see these characters return in a meaningful way.
And so this was really a special game for me. And I loved it from start to finish.
I cannot believe the most articulate you've ever been about games on this podcast is about this fucking licensed Ghostbusters 7 out of 10 ass piece of shit. I mean, it's not a piece of shit. No, it's not.
It's not. It's not amazing. I mean, it is fine, Dave.
I just can't. You saved up all your energy for that one. Unbelievable.
I will say the only thing that dings it is it is really hard to sort of digitize Bill Murray's charisma into a video game character because so much is sort of like flippant, like sort of flippant response to everything that's going on around him and just sort of like the comedy and the nuances of his facial expressions. Very, very hard to do in this generation of games consoles.
I've never played this game, Dave. Does Bill Murray bring his A-game to the performance in this game?
I would say there are times where he does, yes. Not all the time. There are times.
Definitely Dan Aykroyd has never been more excited that he got the call to bring Ghostbusters back. Dan Aykroyd has given 150% to this game.
This is up there with Murray's performance in Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania. That's one of the great Bill Murray performances. All right, Dave, no offence.
That's enough time on this game. All right, I've got two picks. So I'm going to pick a game no one would pick for Category 6 Rhythm Action Sport or Racing, but it was one of my favorite experiences on Xbox 360, and that is Fight Night Round 4, as well as being visually very realistic.
It's one of the only times I've ever seen the controls mapped to the right analog stick to do every meticulous boxing punch you want to do in terms of angle or power you could control with that stick. Expertly done by EA Canada's team making this, and just really realistic looking boxes, getting absolutely beaten up to fuck. I have talked about this game before on the Best Games of 2009 podcast.
I love this game. I think it kind of like crosses the streams. There you go, Dave, between sports game and beat them up.
I think it kind of has a little bit of the appeal of both, but there's just something about the way the camera pulls in, and there's this quick flash whenever you do a perfect counterpunch in this, just knocking poor old dead Muhammad Ali on his ass. Just great stuff. I had a fantastic time with it.
Matthew, you kind of hummed in recognition there.
No, but I just remember this being a big step up, looking very next-gen and impressive and thinking like, that's how you want to be using this power to really bring to life stuff that you could only do in a more kind of cartoony way before.
Yeah, it's very true. It's really just amazing stuff. And it kind of lost as well to history this series.
They haven't made another one. I think that same team went off to make UFC. I don't care about that.
That's not real sport to me, no offence. It's just a bunch of boys fighting in it. Okay, then I'm going to just appeal to the sickos.
And for Category 2 RPG, I'm taking Fallout New Vegas. I'm stooping to their level, Matthew. Did you know that in this game, you can criss-cross all the outcomes and the game will account for your actions even if it turns the story into a big mangled pile of nonsense?
Which is kind of what happens in this game as you play factions off against each other and explore this environment very much in the Fallout 3 kind of like gameplay mold. Vats is back in this, but you go to Vegas. Vegas is kind of like a bit of more of a sort of isolated community with a lot of shady characters there.
And it definitely felt like Fallout Fever was in full steam when this came along. And even though it was like a little bit buggy at launch, people is going to be one of the most beloved RPGs of all time. You know, the fans of it are unbearable.
Keep banging on about it. They can't enjoy avowed. I pity those people.
Pathetic, frankly. However, I think like it really does have a good take on that Vegas setting, so much so that that TV show seems to be quite preoccupied with this game. Yeah, definitely a lot of memorable side characters, even if I personally prefer the main quest of Fallout 3.
That was a little bit more my kind of RPG story. So I wanted to have that in there too. So that's my two picks.
And then it goes over to Dave again.
Yeah, New Vegas is to Fallout 3 what Liam Neeson is to Matthew Perry. That's just what I'm putting out there.
I just don't, I can barely even pass that. It's gone 11 o'clock and I'm, so it's gone 11 o'clock because you were half an hour late for the podcast, Dave. I will not tolerate that from you and Matthew Perry is dead.
So how insensitive, I mean, what the hell man.
You just said you were beating the shit out of Muhammad Ali with glee in the previous thing. Anyway, let's not.
No, I was regretfully beating him up, you know? And to be honest, most of the time I was playing him beating Mike Tyson because Mike Tyson is tiny. So you could just beat him with like massive arms from miles away.
This is why I don't do commentary on boxing. Anyway, Dave, go on.
Look at his tiny arms swinging away. So it's time for me to pick my exclusive. I'm going to go with Fable 3.
I'm going to be as terrible as Samuel and pick another game from the same franchise. As I said earlier, I actually preferred Fable 3 to Fable 2. Bullshit.
No, I did. I genuinely did. I think like, first of all, visually, it was a big step up.
It's not blurry shites like you described it, I think.
I think it has.
I think you did. I think you just did. I think you did.
Then it really sort of just enhances a lot of what made Fable 2 great. But what really stood out for me is like you do that thing where you build up, you overthrow the ruler of the land, your brother. Then it's got this sort of great moment where you just have a sequence of choices based on what's occurred before and you have, yeah, you've got to make tough political decisions essentially, which sort of impact your moral compass and it also impacts the world.
So then the final chapter of the game is you sort of living with the consequences of the decisions that you've made. For that narratively was really an interesting choice. And then it led to some really fun gameplay.
I think ultimately the ending kind of goes the same way, whatever happens, but-
No, not quite.
But that whole section of the game just like basically bringing the game to a standstill for you to make decisions on how you as a rule- It's like the bit that happens after the game that you never see. And I thought that was really an interesting idea that it explored in a really fun way.
I had a great voice cast as well. I think this was Stephen Fry, had Michael Fass been during this one. Yeah, I just really, really loved Fable 3.
It was my favorite of the series.
No Ghostbusters though, is it Dave?
My other wall was full of Fable 3 memorabilia.
Definitely worse than Fable 2, but good game. Okay, we come back to you, Matthew.
I am going for License Game. I'm going to take Telltale's The Walking Dead.
Great pick.
Yeah, obviously again, hopefully Zigging or Zagging, where others are Zigging, whatever the phrase is, is past 11. Telltale had made stuff before it, but I think really put them on the map in terms of not necessarily choices and consequences, but putting you in a mindset where it felt like everything you were deciding was life or death. And whether it was actually, I don't think really mattered.
They sold you on the illusion that everything you were doing could result in the death of key characters. It could in some places, other places, maybe not. But also the central relationship between Lee and Clementine, the little girl he kind of acts as a protector to, is really well observed.
I'd say like almost as well drawn, if not as well drawn, as Joel and Ellie in terms of relationships I was really invested in. I think they kind of ran it into the ground a bit with sequels, but this first one felt like something really special was happening, and they managed to spin another like 15 Telltale style games out of it.
In that moment, it sure was like nothing else.
It kicked off a whole genre, like the whole thing was just like, yeah, the catalyst for like a whole bunch of games and like an investment in that whole genre that, yeah.
And I just remember being so dubious about it at first, being like, well, there's a TV show that's got all this money spent on it, and Frank Darabont made it. Who needs this slightly cartoonish looking game? And it was way better than that TV show.
Well, well, well, I'm not sure about that. Not the first series, surely.
Well, the first series was okay, but anyway, we don't need to litigate that now. Ash, you have two picks.
Right, let's do it. I think now might be the time to get the picks that will lose me the draft. Yes.
Finally.
Finally.
Let's do it. Let's do them both in one go. FPS first.
My short list of FPSs has been whittled down to one by you guys, so I've got to pick this one by default. It's Prey. Not that Prey.
Not the one you all like.
The problematic Prey.
Possibly problematic. I've had maybe a few too many problematic choices in this draft. What can I say about Prey?
It's probably a game that's more interesting than it is good. It could have been one of those sevens if you had that category, but I genuinely love this game. I think what's interesting about it is this game started development in 1995 and came out in 2006.
It could have been another Duke Nukem forever, but they somehow managed to turn that protracted development into a decent game. As a result, you can kind of see this old school FPS from the era of Doom clones stretching and trying to be modern and relevant in the post-Half-Life 2 world. It starts out, it's got a really fantastic opening sequence where it starts out in this bar.
You're playing a Native American character, which is, I suppose, a point of difference. It didn't really matter that much. You start out in this bar and you get abducted by aliens in the beginning, so it's a really exciting sequence at the start.
But you spend a little bit of time chilling out in the bar, talking to people. You can go up to the jukebox and listen to them, Jude as priest. And it's just very reminiscent of what the original Half Life was doing at the beginning.
And then it throws in portals, but it didn't have the invention to do what portal did with portals. It didn't give you control over them. They were more set points in the level design.
But still, for the time, as a part of my brain that's thinking, oh, if this had come out in 1995, it would have been mind-blowing, right? That you go through these portals and you end up walking on the ceiling, seeing yourself coming back at you, all kinds of mind-boggling level design that's completely scripted and completely linear, but came along just before portals. It just kind of got away with it if you played it before.
Still felt a little bit inventive, a little bit mind-boggling. It probably feels old as shit now. But, you know, real heads do like Prey.
It's probably, you know, if Andy Hamilton's listening to this podcast, he's going to vote for me on the strength of this one, and he'll probably be the only one who does. Did anyone else play Prey?
I did. If there's one thing that sets the 360 aside from the PS3, makes it a clearly superior console, it's that there's about a year of software on 360 that comes out before the PS3, and they never really get it. So this is one of the more oddball exponents of that.
There's other games like Chrome Hounds, Condemned, one of the better ones, those kinds of games. But yeah, I did play this, and it feels very like early noughties PC core, in the monster design and things like that. But it was pretty cool, the idea of, oh, these kind of impossible spaces, basically you walk through a portal and then it's like, wow, there's this whole world behind it.
And it was quite wacky. It might have been a good wild card pick, Ash, but I totally get where we're at FPS-wise. It kind of makes sense to put it in here.
Yeah, good deep cut from the library, I think. What's your next pick?
Right, it's time for wild card. And this is the one where, it's past 11, so I'll try not to spend ages explaining. We'll take a little bit of explaining.
It's no Ghostbusters, is it?
This is certainly not Ghostbusters. This is my favorite Ubisoft release, WarTech Senko No Ronde, which is a competitive shmup. This was made by a Japanese developer called G-Rev, who you might know for some classic shoot-em-ups, like Border Down or Under Defeat, which recently got a Switch re-release and is really good.
Senko No Ronde is purely a one-on-one shoot-em-up, almost taking the shmup and making it a fighting game. So best played in two-player, of course. Reviewed from top down, you're kind of mecha robots and you're like dancing around each other, firing out like patterns of bullet hell, trying to avoid those bullets and get a shot in.
You can kind of dash towards each other with a plasma sword and get a few hits in that way. And very excitingly, you've got a couple of limited power-ups that let you transform into a shoot-em-up boss and take up the entire screen, which is a nice way to finish off your opponent once you've ground them down and broken through their armor. You've got armor and energy.
Once you've got through their armor, transform into a boss and give them nowhere to run and utterly destroy them. Really, really satisfying. And a bit like I was saying about Bayonetta, like a truly, truly hardcore game that actually if you can convince someone to play it with you, they'll pick it up in about five minutes.
They'll completely have the measure of it and then you'll just have really good fun playing a totally original and unmatched experience. And I think probably the weirdest thing about this weird game is that Ubisoft picked it up to publish in North America. It didn't get a European release.
I'm not quite sure what they were thinking, but I'm sure glad they did because it's one of my fondest games. I've still got my copy to this day. Really, really love it.
Ash, that's why you're here, mate. You did it.
Sounds shit.
It doesn't have fucking Winston Zeddemore in it, does it, Dave? So it's bullshit.
Ernie Hudson. Ernie Hudson. Don't forget his name.
Please remember him now.
Okay. It does look pretty cool from a cursory search. It is odd that Ubisoft published this.
I agree. I think the more palatable Ashley Day wildcard pick was going to be EDF or something. I think you might have taken that, Ash.
It's on the list. I'm still burnt that my 7 out of 10 review got changed to a 5.
That is rude, frankly. That's just power madness in the Northeast. Okay.
Matthew, penultimate pick.
Wildcard, binary domain.
Hey.
Yes. I think I picked this last time as well. I don't know if it ever cuts through with people, but I love the fact that the Yakuza team stopped making Yakuza for a little bit to make a third-person cover shooter.
I think it actually sits somewhere between Gears of War and Vanquish. It has no way near the movement Vanquish, but a bit more of its visual style in that it's quite a clean kind of sci-fi vision. For my money, I'm not saying this is the best third-person cover shooter on 360, but I do think it has the best hit feel on the enemies, because they're sort of ceramic robots and you blast bits of their limbs off and they keep on coming at you like Terminator if you shoot their legs off, they just keep crawling along the ground and the way they shatter is just that one interaction is so satisfying that it can carry you through any number of fights.
Plus there's a lot of weird sort of Sega accusery stuff on the side, like the other members of your party are all very odd. You have a French robot called Kane and you can hang out with them. It had some Kinect stuff or definitely chat stuff where you could give instructions to the AIs and whatnot, but if you ignore all that nonsense, it's just way better than it should be.
Not a team you would think would make something this great, but I'd say it feels like Makami liked to me and that's just a huge compliment.
Sounds like something you would have played Ash.
Yeah, I only played it a little bit. I probably got about halfway through. Completely agree with everything Matthew said.
I think the surprising thing, which probably not that surprising when you remember who developed it, was the interaction between the characters. It made the downtime in between the action more compelling than it otherwise would have been in a lesser game. I really want to go back and replay this.
It needs some remake. It really does.
All right then, Dave, your penultimate pick.
So I've got FPS and wild card left. I'm going to leave my wild card till last. I'm going to go for FPS.
A game I know none of you would pick, and I know you would expect me to pick, and it's Call of Duty Black Ops, the first one. Now, this is an elite tier pick. While everyone would go for Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2, they're ignoring what was genuinely what I think like the biggest revolution in terms of like online multiplayer in the COD franchise.
Black Ops sort of cemented a lot of what made COD great beforehand, introduced a lot of new elements that sort of became mainstays of the series moving forward. On top of that, like the campaign felt like it sort of really embraced the cinematic spectacle at this point, before it sort of wrestled the control from the player too much, which it kind of did in later entries. There's like these cool bits where you're sort of cruising through Vietnam and Credence Clearwater's playing on the soundtrack, all felt very, yeah, it just kind of like, it felt very electric at the time.
And it was at a weird sort of period as well where all these Hollywood A-listers kind of wanted to be a part of Call of Duty for some reason. So, I mean, I may be stretching the term A-listers here. Sam Worthington was in this one, Ed Harris, Ice Cube, Gary Oldman.
It kind of gave you a bit more bang for your buck. But like I say, like the multiplayer was the big draw for me. It had the introduction of one of the most iconic maps in Yucatown, which, you know, it's remade for every Call of Duty since then.
But there was other great maps too. I remember Jungle was a favourite of mine. What I really liked, what I really loved in fact, was they introduced these wager matches where, I mean, maybe this is a little controversial these days, but you gambled your upgrade points on matches and you could sort of like double them and that would give you more points to upgrade your gear and your weapon unlocks later, but they had this one that was called Sticks and Stones, that was it, where you only had a tomahawk, a crossbow and I think a knife and it's basically you just had to have like pinpoint accuracy and throw these projectiles at the enemies and it was like one hit kill and it was just like a lot of nutty fun.
Just had like the best time online playing that with just randoms and with friends. Yeah, for me this is the Call of Duty that I think of when it comes to like the best of the franchise. It wasn't the first game to have zombies, it was the second game, but it sort of took what zombies did in World War and expanded upon it, made it better, made it more in depth, made the systems more compelling and repeatable.
It just had so much going for it and it was made, it was sort of in that period of competitiveness between Treyarch and Infinity Ward where they were constantly trying to one-up each other. I think this was the game that came out on top during that period.
That's bollocks. What a load of old rubbish that is.
It's not bollocks. You've never played it though. You don't know.
The idea that came out on top is pure fabrication for this draft. I will say, I won't pass comment on the multiplayer because I think everything you say there is completely fair, especially the zombie stuff. The campaign is so mid next to Call of Duty Modern Warfare, like so mid and Modern Warfare 2, no where near as good as either of those games.
Really like the dumbass dropped on its head version of those campaigns. The music cues were just like, I feel like someone played COD 4 and thought, we can do this, but miss the point and make it really daft. Then I think that it's a gentle slide in quality of the COD campaigns after this.
Then you got Sam Worthington on horseback in the next one. It's just a little nonsense.
It's before they added Dogs and before Kit Harrington and Kevin Spacey were talking over FutureTech. But genuinely, I think this was where they were going for more of an edgy Tarantino-esque tone to their campaigns. I really liked it.
I think the Black Ops brand has endured more than the Modern Warfare one in a weird way. These characters keep popping up in sequels afterwards. I think that speaks to how beloved this was from a campaign perspective.
It's true, though. It's true.
Bit of a doubt from me, dog. I mean, those characters do pop up again, for sure. Blok with a bandana from this one was definitely in Blob 6 when I played that last year.
Could I tell you his name? No, I could not.
It's Woods.
It's Woods.
Oh, yeah, Woods. Iconic.
You shit.
Back to me. Because it's gone the three-hour mark here, we should wrap up. So, very quick, last two picks then from me.
XBLA, I'm taking the mighty Peggle. Don't fuck with Peggle.
Kill yourself. Oh, sorry, I'm just repeating what you said last time.
Yeah, just fantastic score attack puzzle game. This gets me Peggle Nights as well, which despite its name is not horny. There's lots of like cursed weird cartoon animals and just really compelling nice little sounds.
Just trying to like pull off like these ridiculous trick shots. It's really just gently entertaining and so cathartic to play. Definitely a bit of a bomb during the pandemic for me.
I was a huge Peggle guy and it was definitely a big XBLA thing. I think it was on all platforms, but I just remember it being huge on Xbox in particular at the time. Ash, did Peggle happen to you, Ash?
Yes, I was utterly obsessed with it. In fact, I was going to mention, I had the 360 out preparing for this podcast, and my three-year-old girl came into the room. She wanted to play a game, so I put Peggle on for her.
Nice and simple. She loved being the unicorn. She also loves Puzzle Bobble and Peggle is like an upside down Puzzle Bobble.
Another great game that anyone can play and enjoy, and I think that's a real strength. It's like some of the greatest games of all time are just suitable for all people, all ages. Yeah, Peggle is great.
I wanted a bit of counter program into my other stuff as well. Last time I picked Shadow Complex and I found that a tiny bit rusty on playing it again after we did the last 360 draft. It's very shiny in some ways.
Sorry Matthew, you're about to pick it.
No, I have to say I've got fond memories of that game, but I don't know if it holds up as well as you think it might.
I've played so many Metroidvanias since that game. I've thought about that Perfect Darkport as well, which we had a great time with last year when we did that episode. But it made sense to pick something that was original to the system, so Peglet is.
Last pick then, Horror or Stealth. Good God, there's so much in this category, hard to narrow it down. Got it down to Alan Wake, Deus Ex, Human Revolution, Fear, Dead Space and Condemned.
Of those, I think in terms of variety, Alan Wake is worse than Dead Space. I think Deus Ex loses to Dishonored if we're playing this like chess. I've got too many first-person shooters to take Fear.
And so I think it is going to be Dead Space, one of the bold swings by EA of this generation. Very kind of different horror experience where you were, this kind of like limb-cutting tech was at the core of the experience, kind of diegetic, sort of like world design, but just really simple. We're just going to make a basically alien style setting, lots of cool monsters, just like a great campaign that doesn't go on for too long and gives you the kind of real rush of how the fuck do I get off of this place.
Really lovely art direction, remade a few years ago, of course, because it just had such a great reputation. Second one, good too, a little bit more kind of the scripted narrative stuff of an Uncharted or Naughty Dog gaming. The second one, the first one's a little bit purer.
People seem to like it a bit more than Rezzy at the time. I love both games. There's definitely a kind of raw, mechanical excellence to Dead Space that I respect, so that's my pick for the final category.
I actually wrote it in Dead Space because I thought that's what you were going to pick in my little plan where I was guessing what it was going to be. So yeah, it's a really good pick. Dead Space 1 over 2?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I think it's a purer, scarier game. I think Dead Space 2 is a little too action-y to really nail you to the spite and fear.
Yeah, feels a tiny bit more dated to pick it up now, I think, the second one, just because it feels very in that vein of what character, what playable talking characters were like back then, just in terms of narrative. Okay, then we come back to Dave for your final pick.
I just got one thing to say. It's my wildcard pick, and we all remember this iconic line, we've got to go back. And that's why I'm picking for Wildcard, Lost Viadomus.
Yeah, yes.
Absolutely iconic game from the 360 era. Now, while Sam there was playing the game, cycling through what will be the most popular pick with the audience, this dude, I'm playing from the heart. I was there.
I lived in the culture during 2000 and I want to say eight, whatever this was, and Lost Fever gripped the world. Lost Viadomus, you could say, was the perfect companion to the TV show. You could less generously say, it was the perfect companion to the book, Bad Twin by Gary Troop.
Whatever you want to say about it, there's, you can't deny that this was catnip for lost fans during this period. Now, yes, a lot of your favorite prestige TV characters from this ensemble were sort of recreated with spanned face, dead-eyed looks, and had some of the worst line readings from like, whatever budget actors they could find, because Harold Perry knew didn't want to come back. Like that may be true.
But in terms of like, one-to-one replicating the island, replicating the hatch, bridging the gap between seasons, I believe this landed somewhere around mid-season three, in like a break, maybe between season, maybe just after season three, somewhere around then. It allowed you to sort of explore the mysteries of that world in a way that just felt amazing as someone who loved Last, who wanted to spend more time with his character, who wanted to go deeper into the lore of the island. And it gave you some of these little breadcrumbs of sort of additional information about who these people were, why they were there, gave you more insight into the others.
Because I believe Michael Emerson was in this, I want to say, as Ben Linus. I believe Elizabeth Mitchell was there as Juliet as well, voicing her character, I believe. Now, gameplay-wise, it was literally walking from one place to another, talking to people, and then occasionally there was a pipe puzzle where you had to connect water networks.
Very complex, the only, essentially the only gameplay mechanic was ripped off from Bioshock. But that didn't take away from this being an amazing experience. Like, who doesn't want to live in a hatch?
Who doesn't want to be Sawyer or Jack or even Charlie? You know, this was the game for lost fans, and I think everyone deep down is a lost fan. So that's why it belongs on this list.
I was a huge lost fan and I gave this three an edge.
I like this game so much, I watched a full walkthrough on YouTube from start to finish and still bought it afterwards and completed it.
A full walkthrough and you need a whole two hours. This game was rubbish.
I like that Dave has gone off the deep end slightly with a pick. I mean, yeah, I sort of, I will admit to being a bit more sort of like, I will pick things that I know are good. And I think people were like, I didn't, I don't think I ever lost Odyssey as close as I got to something like this.
And that's a great game. This is a load of old nonsense. I will give you this, Dave.
It does replicate the crash site bit of the TV show quite well. That is one thing I remember it doing quite authentically. I'll give it that.
The hatch is good too.
Okay, I'll take your word for it on that one. I don't think it got that far.
Dave's mini console is the one to get if you want a digital Bill Murray and a digital Michael Emerson.
Yeah, exactly. I feel like PS3 Hurley is very much a PS1 Hagrid Descendant. It's just like a lot of similar energy to that, I would say.
There is a line reading of it where his face just doesn't move and he goes, dude, no.
Yeah, I remember a Heroes game also made by yourself was canceled after this game came out probably because it was a piece of shit and no one wanted it. Okay, great way to go out, Dave. Matthew, you'll find a pick.
Oh God, free pick, nightmare. I've got about 10 different things I could pick.
I lost this off the board now, so really in a pickle.
The 360, while absolutely brilliant, the one area it's quite bad on is, you know, there's nothing visual novel-y. There's nothing, there's no like mystery or detective games that I really liked except for LA. Noir.
So I'm going to take that as my free pick.
Fuck. Oh yeah, that's a good pick.
At the time, I remember someone playing this on Edge, previewing it and saying, oh, you're going to like this. It's like AAA Ace Attorney, which is sort of true in that, you know, the kind of interrogations are a bit like the courtroom scenes. Obviously, it's got that sort of nebulous reading the faces mechanic.
But, you know, probably actually to dredge up a similar argument to Dave with Lost There, you know, if you are watching TV at the time that LA. Noir came out, this was just full of people from shows and dramas that you probably really enjoyed. And there was a certain thrill in seeing them, you know, looking cool in cool outfits in this cool time period.
I don't think they ever truly made the most of this amazing, massive LA that they made. But there's a shitload of mysteries and murders and crimes in this game to solve. And if that's what you like, and that is what I like, this is really good fun.
I'm quite fond of it.
Yeah, I think that's well cut through because it really is. Because what else is there on the system you compare it to? Probably Telltale's The Walking Dead, which you picked.
Just something visual and overly. Yeah, I like this game. Ash, I think I'm going to be you liking this game as well.
Or at least playing this game because someone told you it was kind of like a point and click game.
I also was attracted to this because it seemed like Rockstar's Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney. I got a little bit too hung up on the mechanic of trying to understand if someone was lying.
Yeah.
Sometimes I would find that my instincts were completely the opposite of what the game actually wanted me to do in that moment. So I think the thing that attracted me to it ended up not being the strength of the game. But what was the strength was I think the strength you see in a lot of Rockstar games, which was the sense of place, the setting, the time period, the quality of the acting, all of that stuff.
If you wanted a really like immersive detective game, this was it. And arguably still is it. I don't know if there's...
In this kind of mold of like trying to represent the world as a 3D place you can walk around, I can't think of a better version of it.
Also the second game picked that has Greg Grunberg in it. So unfortunately he didn't reprise his famous role from Lost for Lost Via Domus, but who can imagine what score he would have got in Edge if he did?
Well if I had to pick this or Lost Via Domus, it would certainly be a difficult choice. Okay, yeah, it's like poorly rendered Dominic Monaghan or well rendered Pete Campbell from Mad Men. That's the choice there.
The naughty TV show town.
Unhelpfully that the screenshots you put in the chat have lost.
Yeah, they're so good. I might even include them in the episode Patreon post just for context. Final pick then, Ashley Day.
I've got XBLA left. I honestly think you could do an entire draft of XBLA games. There's so many fantastic ones.
I struggled a bit with this. Jeff Minter's Space Giraffe is not the one I'm picking, but is a name I wanted to throw out there. It's a truly bizarre game that made XBLA such an exciting place to scurry around in and find little gems.
But my pick, much like Dave, I do love Busting Ghosts. Therefore, my pick is Pac-Man Championship Edition. Oh, yeah.
A fantastic score attack version of one of the greatest arcade games of all time, reimagined for the modern arcade as it was back then. This, of course, reinvented Pac-Man in widescreen, neon colors, disco music. Geometry wars up Pac-Man, but also harken back to what you would call caravan shooters of the 80s, which were timed arcade experiences where you just had to try and get the best high score that you could in the time available.
So each game was limited to just five minutes. You know, like old arcade games, if you got good at them, they could just kind of go on and on forever and became endurance tests. Pac-Man Championship de Petition was five minutes, get as many points as you can in those five minutes, and brilliantly to add to the sense of pace, the more points you got, the faster and faster and faster the game became until you got to the point where you were effectively skidding around the corners of the maze, and it felt like sparks were flying off Pac-Man as he did so.
Lots of other little tricks to the game. It did a really good job of pulling you from one side of the maze to the other by, if you scored loads of points on one side of the maze, it would put a fruit or something on the other side of the maze, attempt to across, you get a load of points there, and it would transform the other side of the maze, so it was a different pattern when you went back there. Just one of those really imaginative arcade revivals that kept throwing new idea after new idea still somehow felt true to the original Pac-Man, and was in fact the final game to be designed by Toru Iwatani, the creator of Pac-Man, so had that DNA at its core, but felt brilliantly modern.
Also did that thing that I think Geometry Wars 2 did really well, which was it was plugged in to the leaderboards, so you were constantly aware of who on your friends list had a high score, slightly higher than yours, so you really felt like you had to keep bettering yourself, constantly improving, constantly trying to get up that virtual leaderboard. I spent hours and hours playing this game.
I think it sums up what XBLA was for in a lot of ways. I think in the early part of that generation, we definitely saw a lot of rifts on old arcade games come back, but with shiny HD vision, I remember being very buzzy in playing it and being like, wow, I can't believe they managed to make this out of Pac-Man, something I thought I was so done with and so bored of. Yeah, very impressive.
Okay, it's three hours, 20 minutes in, we finally finished the draft, bloody hell. Let's recap our list, gentlemen. Thank you for your time and patience in putting this episode together.
