Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello, Matthew. How was your Christmas 2025 and New Year break? Did you get up to much? We talked about this a bit on the last Patreon episode, but Not that comprehensively. What's been going down?

Matthew
00:39
I've been playing lots of detective games that I missed in 2025, so I've been mopping up some smaller things which had passed me by Very lazy, but engaging my brain enough through said detective games and a few detective novels. Absolutely fine Very standard. No spicy takes, I'm afraid.

Samuel
00:59
That's all right. I was m you know more asking from a a leisurely what you been up to perspective than did you punch a man or something. And to you uh in reverse. I did very little over the break really. It was even less than normal. My parents are really disappointed that their local cinema, which is in Payton, um in Devon, wasn't showing Marty Supreme on Boxing Day, and I think they relied on that as being the centrepiece of the time off. And because that didn't happen, because it wasn't released at that point in that cinema, we just did like nothing basically for seven days. Uh I went to an arcade in Plymouth, that was alright. There was like this area where you could sit on beanbags and play original Smash Bros. on N64 did that and uh demolished my brother um as Kirby, which is what you do when you play Smash Bros. with a sibling, isn't it? So um Bit of the old down B, down B on him. Yeah, exactly. He was livid, um, as you might expect, as uh as well someone should be when that happens to them in the original Smash Bros. So um Yeah, and I had a absolutely terribly sore ass afterwards because I'm not meant to sit on a beanbag anymore, I'm a thirty-seven-year-old man. So that was um My break in a nutshell already and I've played loads of Arc Raiders since I've come back. And loads of GT four for that episode this month, Matthew. Yeah, it's um uh you're not My It's been pretty uneventful, but I don't mind. It's absolutely horrendously cold outside, so there's no real reason to go anywhere or do anything, is there? So um, I thought I'd give you a a food update. I went to JC's kitchen today for the first time in four years, Matthew. Yeah. Well I went just before Christmas and gave you an update, so you did. And I um I did try the loaded fries. Maybe it's because you sort of inception style planted the idea in my head and I was like, well I've got to go gotta go get a piece of that. I was actually pretty impressed by it. I would rather it was just some noodles or some rice or something, but either way it was a good it felt like I had about 1600 calories for lunch and I was really ready for a nap afterwards, but um unfortunately had more work to do so I continued. And that's my update really. Yeah, I think that's right. I think you said, yeah, I've got mango, pineapple, and one other one now. And I was like, uh okay, uh and he said, oh the mango and the other one uh are the new ones and went, okay. But I'm pretty sure I had this mango habanero. back in the day, but he just doesn't remember the last time I went there. And

Matthew
03:07
You are so much more daring with condiments than I am. Do you not go for the sauces? What's I'm like, what's the plainest mayonnaise you got, my man? But you're not going for any of the sauces. They're like the best bit, I think.

Samuel
03:17
No, I'm I'm not really into exotic sauces. But they're not that exotic really. Mango's not that exotic bit by the stands of 2026 in my opinion.

Matthew
03:28
That's a that's that's not a mains.

Samuel
03:31
Yeah, okay. This should be served in turnover form, not in uh not in meat sauce.

Matthew
03:36
form. Basically ever since my applesauce Larian disaster, uh I've I really object to all fruits in savory meals. That

Samuel
03:45
He's got these little sauce balls with what looks like AIR on the front of them as well.

Matthew
03:50
Very cursed.

Samuel
03:51
That is quite cursed. Um at least there's no imagery of Jesus Christ or similar. He Um that's um that's something.

Matthew
03:57
But uh yeah and that's what would you even type in to whatever AI program you're using for that. I r I run a chicken tent. This is a mango sauce. What you got?

Samuel
04:09
Yeah, exactly. Show me what a source looks like as a hell dimension. And that's kind of like what the art looks like. So um yeah, I'm not sure I'll have to ask about his AI prompts next time I go in with you. Um, okay then. First episode of the year. Welcome back to the podcast. Uh we had a little week off there, which was a good idea because I think I feel a bit replenished. I've not seen Matthew in ages actually. We should go we should hang out in real life soon, Matthew. That'd be good. Um but uh I do feel like it's been a little while since we've done a a normal one of these. So um glad to be back. Uh the predictions episodes, people know what the deal is, they're completely uninformed. Um we uh we'll take wild stabs in the dark based on nothing whatsoever. You'll hear no insider information on this podcast whatsoever. So I don't want to see any of this turning up on social media with some guy going, this bloke with insider information knows this. We know nothing. From fucking Greg the Peg or something. Greg the Peg. Yeah, w whatever it might be. So um it's it's you know really important we make that clear. ill-informed takes uh about the year ahead is what you're getting this time. It's 26 predictions about 2026, so me and Matthew have done 13 in each and we'll uh we'll run through them basically. But um How did you find the process of coming out from predictions with for this episode this year, Matthew? Harder or easier than normal?

Matthew
05:21
Uh hard for a while and then suddenly Like the stopper just came out of my brain and and some ideas spilled out. I won't say they're particularly good ideas, they're very Nintendo-centric. I feel like every year we do this podcast, we get closer to the ideal version of this episode. I think if you go back to some of the earlier ones, there's like some pathetic attempts at like industry analysis of like I think Netflix are gonna buy this and you're like who gives a fuck really? So uh now I realize people just want to hear like thirteen wishes. Yeah, basically.

Samuel
05:55
But you say that, Matthew, but your predictions last year were weirdly spot on. Not all of them, but some of them are like I mean r uh un uncanny I would say. I was I was a I was kind of spooked by how accurate you got a few of them. And I'm gonna run through them now, because my mine are more wrong or more incorrect. So I'll run through mine first and then I'll run through Matthew's. So And we can start for any commentary along the way, but um it'll be a pretty quick process.

Matthew
06:20
So these are your 2025 predictions?

Samuel
06:23
Indeed, yes. So my first one, uh Nintendo Switch 2 launches in March 2025. Nope. Nope, cost $379. 99 in the UK. Nope. And launches of 3D Mario. Nope. That's pretty close on price, eh, to be fair. Is it like $379? At the beginning of April. So Yeah, it wasn't too far off, but um yeah, more accurate uh switch two predictions are coming, so uh look forward to that. Um Mario Kart 9 launches at Christmas on the Switch successor? Nope. Resident 9 is revealed this year but launches in early 2026. Ding! Got that one correct. Uh wasn't called Resident World 9, but you know, close enough. Nintendo Switch finally gets those Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remasters in the waning days of the Switch. Nope, didn't happen. GTA 6 doesn't come out this year, but it's not because a single player isn't ready, it's because GTA Online needs a longer runway. Now, GTA 6 did not come out in 2025. Um but who knows what the reason is because um Rockstar never tells anyone anything. So um that is a mystery. Marvel nineteen forty three Rise of Hydra is our game of the year contender, the game didn't come out Yeah, I might still be a game of the year contender when it does come out. Yeah, I mean possibly. No. Um we see nothing of Wolverine on PS5 at all this year, incorrect. Um but Sony has a good year with Ghosts of Yote. Uh Death Stranding 2, those are both correct. And the sequel to Returnal, that was incorrect, but they did announce that. Yeah. Persona 6 is announced this year, then released in early 2026. Nope. Incorrect. Um Dynasty Warriors Origins takes over the January gaming discourse brackets until Monster Hunter comes out. That didn't really happen, to be honest. Just on this point. Oh, and it took over hour. January gaming discourse. And is that not really the discourse when it comes down to it, Matthew? I'm happy to accept that as a tip. Thank you. Uh the consensus finally turns against souls likes as we get nine more grey games with game with names like The Path of Death and Demon Sheath. that no one remembers one month after release. U Now, I'm gonna give myself a tick for this one because Wu Chang Fallen Feathers came out last year, and I think that did that didn't quite get the reception they were hoping for. And um did kinda get forgotten about a month after release and uh they are still making loads of these. What do you think? Did I get that one correct, Matthew?

Matthew
08:29
Definitely feel like In the last few years, every gaming showcase, you know, whether it's a Jeff thing or a future game show or whatever has been dominated by just endless new souls like. So I feel like that didn't really happen in the showcases last year. Whether that's evidence that the sort of tide is turning for this particular genre of games, I don't know. But they're There certainly weren't any in the running for like Game of the Year last year.

Samuel
08:56
No, it didn't really happen, did it? So um yeah. Uh okay, so um Two more from me. The Star Wars XCOM alike made by former Thorax staff at BitReactor is unveiled this year. It was Star Wars Zero Company coming out this year. Finally, a languid double bill of hotel dusk and last window drops a Nintendo Switch. This did not happen.

Matthew
09:15
Um that's what happens when you try and use your predictions to wound me instead of trying to actually predict the future.

Samuel
09:22
So But what makes for better podcasting? That's what I'm about at the end of the day, man. So um okay, onto your predictions. So The 3D Mario team are making a 3D Donkey Kong game to launch alongside the Switch 2. I mean, you got the timing off ever so slightly, but Jesus Christ. Um well done, Matthew.

Matthew
09:40
I know I've been guessing the Donkey Kong game for like The last two prediction episodes I think we've done, so I was bound to get it right eventually.

Samuel
09:48
Yeah.

Matthew
09:53
Interestingly, what was wrong Like my thinking was always informed by how big a role Donkey Kong had in the film and how thought out his universe was, which to me spoke to like something's going on behind the scenes and then the fact that they built Donkey Kong World as the next bit of the Nintendo Universal Studios thing. But actually the game had very little kind of Donkey Kong universe in it, I felt, in terms of that trad you know, what you see in the film. And the theme park ended up being quite Donkey Kong Country Returns flavoured So it was uninformed in its own way. No, I'm gonna give you that one for sure. Thank you. I mean you can still give it, but I'm just saying, like, that was my thinking, and actually that That didn't really amount to much, so I'm not basing any more predictions on what's going on at that fucking theme park.

Samuel
10:46
It's got a few um different extended Donkey Kong universe accoutrement as well, like um It's me, Cranky Kong, and um A bit of the old Diddy Kong in there as well, you know? That is true. That is true. Um, okay, the Switch 2 will release with Mario Kart 9. Correct. Well done, Matthew. You did that one. That was no no notes, sir Square Enix to release a standalone version of Queen's Blood or at least add online battling to rebirth. It's a nice idea though. I mean like you say wishes. They're just wishes. Yeah, I still think they should do this. Yeah Blue Point will reveal an expanded remake of Bloodborne. Uh didn't happen obviously. No. Um G GTA 6 will contain a side quest where you work with a true crime podcaster to explore the events of the original Vice City. Letting them dunk on some of the worst missions of the game. Had we just played Vice City when you did this one or something? No, no, we played Vice City after this. Yeah, okay. Even either way that's funny. I hope that still happens. Could happen. Um Mark Strong will be announced as playing Ganondorf in the Legend of Zelda movie. Could still happen. Could still happen. I mean they did announce the cast this year, so we're we're getting there with that one, I guess. Team Ninja will mark thirty years of their studio with a reboot of Ninja Gaiden. You're pretty spot on with this really. Hmm. Do you not think so?

Matthew
11:57
Yeah, oh yeah. I mean they yeah, there was a new a new Ninja Garden Ninja Gaiden 4, which I guess counts.

Samuel
12:03
Yeah, I think so. It's like a new character, it's a different sort of take on the series. I think that's pretty good to be honest. So well done. That got announced like within days of doing this episode, so yeah. The new game from the Yakuza team Project Century will be revealed to have a big hook where it's not confined to nineteen fifteen and will jump through several time periods to show the evolution of one area over the last 100 years. Nice idea, but we haven't really heard much more about that game, have we?

Matthew
12:27
No, but I guess they're they're pushing the third one and then the Kualamy three that is and and then hopefully they'll ramp up this one and we'll see that I was correct.

Samuel
12:38
Um twenty twenty five is going to be an absolutely amazing year for visual novel likers and uh I think you're pretty much a tick. for this? Because a hundred line what do you think?

Matthew
12:47
Yeah I mean uh defin I think the hundred line kept us well fed but it also ate up so much writing resource that the people involved didn't make any other games, so um like it's it's it to me anyway, it felt like this one or bust. Maybe there's some absolute gleaming hidden gem that I uh missed. I mean maybe you could I mean this isn't right, but you could factor in the quite excellent plot construction of Silent Hill F. perhaps into this in that he is a visual novel guy who wrote it. Shame to be inconvenient spoiled that combat in between, but I take it more than you. That's what I felt when I played his previous works. Like, oh man, I wish I could break up This beautifully constructed story with some incredibly vanilla combat where I hit meat with a baseball bat.

Samuel
13:37
And so here's the one where I'm like Is Matthew Castle actually Nostradamus? Because Blue Prince is going to be the indie game of the year that loads of people end up hating and being a bit cross about because they don't get it. I mean You called this based on the demo. Well done, Matthew. What was your thinking there?

Matthew
13:55
Just that it's a it's a vicious cycle and this this will always happen. I think it was off the back of Animal Well having had the same kind of reaction and I thought it was gonna be animal well esque in its intellectual rigour. So um Guessing that there's gonna be discourse around any game is basically a like a a freebie in this exercise.

Samuel
14:19
Yeah, but this was a bit This is a bit different, I think, because you caug you got the exact reaction correct. Is that because s some people just did not the people who hated it really hated it and the people who liked it really liked it and You're right, there was a bit of that with Animal Well, which to me feels like a forgotten game to be honest, two years hence. Oh that's that's very convenient for someone who doesn't like Animal Well. Does anyone talk about that game now?

Matthew
14:42
I mean I just I still look back on it funly. I don't talk about it a lot, but I think I don't I um I was about to lie and say I think about it often, which I don't. Um A slinky Matthew.

Samuel
14:52
They put that in a Metroidvania. Uh I don't know why I'm being such a shit about this. But Blueprints was like I think Blueprints is a game that people will talk about and discover for years and years. It feels like it's got that that potential tail to it and it feels like it got more game of the year recognition than Animal World did. So I'm just I think you really do deserve your flowers for this one. I think you really killed it. So well done. Two more from Matthew. From the sublimely correct to the sublimely incorrect. Um the next Shootakubie game will be a meta-ac attorney game set across other Capcom franchises involving crime. Set in the universes of Monster Hunter, Resident Evil, and Dead Rising. I love this idea, but this again is like a wish list one, isn't it?

Matthew
15:30
Yeah, I mean I still I haven't got a shooter country this year. He's gotta be doing something. Like they haven't just kept him around to occasionally do one minute adverts for ace tourney remakes. I mean if he has that's like the easiest gig in games development.

Samuel
15:46
And they've done all of his games now, haven't they, apart from Dino Crisis 2? They're all like widely available again.

Matthew
15:51
Everything. Everything's done. Everyone's like, oh, I think he's gonna make a dyno crisis. He's spoken uh several times on the record that he didn't think he was a good fit for that And that ace attorney was the thing he actually wanted to do. I just don't think that's gonna happen. I a dino crisis might happen, but I don't think Shiftakumi's gonna have anything to do with it.

Samuel
16:11
A funny prospect that. Um yeah, I guess People just there are people out there who have worse takes on the future than us, Matthew. It's good to know that you know the the the the the floor goes lower than these predictions in our podcast. So that's that's good. Um and your final take Um Judas triggers a tsunami of boring Ken Living think pieces, but we're all secretly thankful to have a traditional mainstream FPS that at least attempts something interesting narratively. Oh that's a great prediction. I mean it didn't quite happen 'cause th the game's not out yet, but I think this I think both these things will happen when it finally comes along. Anything to add here?

Matthew
16:44
No.

Samuel
16:49
Yeah, it's gonna get a wild amount of scrutiny of that game and I just want to play it to be honest. So uh I remain open minded about these things. Okay, uh Matthew, we come to this year's predictions. Should we kick off with one of yours? I feel like I've got a lot of um

Matthew
17:02
A lot of lazy anniversary predictions in this. Yeah, my favourite. Let's kick off with my number one prediction slash wish Nintendo will celebrate the 40th anniversary of Metroid by announcing a Super Metroid remake by Mercury Steam. Hmm. Interesting. I see a logic there. Yeah, basically picking up from what they did with Metroid 2 Samus Returns on the 3DS, you know, where they took the bones of the game and then kind of blew it out. Now I Perhaps they could do the old uh you know, may maybe there is just gonna be a sequel to Metroid Dread at some point But that felt like too vague a prediction. It wouldn't be very impressive if that came true. So I decided to add a little bit of my Nostradama's spice to this. Uh as I have now proven that I can will things into existence. And uh I think Super Metroid would be interesting after our Metroid episode where I picked Super Metroid as the best Metroid game I saw a few people responding on the Discord and whatnot saying that they'd gone back to it and just found it too old. Like it's just too backwards compared to you know, playing those Mercury Steam ones or even Metroid Fusion, which made me wonder, like, is is there actually some mileage in taking this thing which is structurally brilliant? has loads of atmosphere, great set pieces, but could maybe be a little slicker under the thumbs, perhaps. So that's where this comes from.

Samuel
18:38
I think that makes sense. How Often do Nintendo mark the anniversary of something with a a a significant release?

Matthew
18:46
Very rarely. I get the feeling like if something's finished and it happens to a line that they c they'll then do a Oh, this has happened. Like, I feel like Zelda got some 30th anniversary stuff because, like, Wind Waker HD happened to be ready. Right. No, that's not right. Yeah, that was before. That was earlier. Or was that the 20th anniversary? You know, they're good at creating marketing beats around what games they have. I don't think they go, it's going to be the year of Luigi, let's make loads of Luigi stuff. They happen to have like a couple of Luigi things and then go, oh this would be a kind of cute bow that we can tie on this. Uh so i it is a dangerous game trying to reverse engineer. But you can also see it on Nintendo Direct. You can see you know, Sakamoto popping up and being like, it's the 40th anniversary and we're so pleased you've been fans of it and so I'm excited to announce that da da da da da da That Nintendo Direct B I I've seen that enough times to know that these things can happen.

Samuel
19:49
I'm guessing you've got a similar Zelda one in the U. S. Oh, I've got a few. Okay. I'm getting an idea of the general arc. Yeah, so it's the Fourtieth anniversary of both Zelda and Metroid this year. So that's quite um yeah, quite a lot going on. Okay, yeah, so it was Wind Waker was for the thirtieth.

Matthew
20:05
I guess I just completely No, 'cause it wasn't twenty sixteen, was it? It was more than one.

Samuel
20:08
No, it was twenty it was twenty thirteen, wasn't it? So Yeah, that must have just been the ten year anniversary of that game. That was an O three game, right? So yeah. Anyway. Um, okay. My first prediction in Matthew, it could not be further away from that really. But it is the one where I'm a bit like I I guess I I had some editorial instincts at play here, based on my experience playing a a a game connected to the game I've made the prediction about. So the game that blew Marathon off the map in twenty twenty five will become its unlikely saviour in twenty twenty six. Marathon will become a success because Arcraders has trained a wider audience to understand and engage with extraction shooters. They will have made changes to the game, bungee this is, that keep the difficulty in step with Arcraders. And the 40 quid price point will be the sweet spot, making enough people try it to uh to create like a quite a big quite a big player base in the start. It will not be Concorde 2. 0. It will fly, at least at launch. So, I know you have a good extraction shooter, Matthew. But um I was very lukewarm when I played Marathon last year. I think most people were. They've been posting quite a lot of gifts of visual changes they've made to the game. And I think that Artgraders content cycle won't move fast enough. Bas I think it will like w w by the time they get major content out the door. I think the audience will start to be start looking around for other things to play. So far they put out like an alright amount of stuff. The game came out in October, I think, and it's been sort of like going along and there's plenty in there to get to grips with. I think there's something like fifty hours worth of just core game missions to sort of tick off basically. But I do think that by the time that marathon rolls around, I think that audience will be like, let's just give something else a try. And a first person shooter made by Bungie that's had a bit more time in the tank, a bit more, a bit more tweakage before launch will uh will will really help. And again, it's just that that thing where it's not free to play. It's 40 quid. I can just see it taking off. And I can just I just get I think the audience now, they understand how these games work. I think they're gonna be well up for more of them. So Yeah, I think this is the moment that this genre really breaks out in a big way. So yeah, I don't know if you have any thoughts on this genre that you don't give a shit about.

Matthew
22:20
No, I I love that as an idea, and like you say, it's it's not really a a genre I think about too deeply but I I like that narrative the idea that it it's kind of prepared the way for this to actually be when we say successful week do you think it's gonna be like a Helldivers 2 mega year for it or just not a disaster? I mean that would be enough, right?

Samuel
22:39
I think yeah, not a disaster. I think like maybe it'll sell like three, four, five million, something like that. But it won't become my Helldivers 2 but I think that If you've got 12 million people who have bought art graders, which is apparently the number, I think just I think that that audience will just be hungry for something else. And it's out in March. So they don't have that much time to roll out loads of new content for Arc Raiders. I can just see it working in Bungie's favor. But if they'd have released at the same time last year, it would it would have killed them. But now I think it's the other way around.

Matthew
23:06
So I st I still feel like the extreme hostility towards it from other people who you know who are invested more in this genre or have played it or whatever, you know, like when they put out those shots of how they'd changed the look of the thing. That made its s uh its way into my feed through criticism of the new look, going, well, I actually preferred the the specificity of the first game, and it's like This poor fucking game that's stuck between it looks too bland, it looks too ugly, does itself up and then people are like, Oh, you've lost what was charming about the bland and ugly game that we all hated six months ago. You know, you just can't win and What you've described could well happen, but it has such a mountain of opinion to get over. And l last year and well recent years I have shown that it is Quite hard for games to change the narrative in that way.

Samuel
24:02
It is, but it is still bungee.

Matthew
24:06
But that's quite a scalp, you know, for the online masses to claim if they can bring it down.

Samuel
24:11
It is, yeah, and that is I I do think that a lot of these people are wired that way for sure. And it is bleak that people are wired that way. They mill games into failure. That sucks. But yeah, I just think that there's a whole generation of players who did not understand what these games were when the marathon beta happened. or closed alpha, whatever it was. And I think that now they all completely understand what the genre is and they're gonna want more. And this is gonna be The most polished off the shelf one they can just pick up and play. Um that's not an existing game and it's from a developer that has some cachet. behind them. I don't think this is gonna be quite the same thing. Maybe we'll get to this episode next year and I'll be like, oh, I really got that one wrong. But it feels right to me. I'm curious about it. I'm curious to see what they've done with it. And I can just see there being a moment where Tom and Phil who I play um I play art graders with or we're just like should give that a go and then we'll just jump over and see what the deal is. Like it's It's not like marathon was irretrievable, and it's not like they even showed their full hand of what they had in mind. Like the best piece I've read about marathon was by Tim Clark on PC Gamer, and he wrote about a map that they'd been shown but weren't allowed to talk about yet. There was I like set in a spaceship or something like that. And he and it hinted at there being something quite interesting gameplay wise that wasn't in the other maps which are quite static feeling multiplayer maps. So I don't know. I think um I think the combination of like Bungie's ability to create intrigue around their games in terms of like the content they roll out. I'm talking about your Destiny Raid type stuff and all the things they've done with that game over the years that weren't just arbitrary time wasting activities, which is apparently what they do they've been doing with the game in the last two years. If they can just get enough of that magic in the game while getting the basics right enough that it doesn't feel like a mountain to climb just playing it, which is the colour That's the secret source of our craters. It never feels like the end, even when you've lost everything. Because it just it's too it's so easy to get your stuff back to keep moving again to make progress. So Yep, long-winded Matthew, but um yeah, we'll see how that goes.

Matthew
26:11
Oh, I liked it.

Samuel
26:12
Oh cheers. What was your number two?

Matthew
26:14
My number two is borrowing from a widely reported rumour that's doing the rounds at the moment that the Witcher 3 is going to have I think this rumour basically comes from some kind of investment call where they they spoke rather mysteriously about something that was going to bring them like s you know, income it this year, but it's too soon for Witcher 4 and it's not a cyberpunk sequel. And so where on earth this rumor's really come from, whether there's any truth in it, I don't know, but the idea of a Witcher 3 expansion that maybe focuses on Ciri instead of Geralt sort of introducing her a little bit more, setting up her a little bit more before the kind of starring role in The Witcher Four. I could see that. So my prediction is that there will be a Witcher 3 DLC focused on Siri. I think it will fill in the time between the end of the Witcher 3 and the end of the Blood on Wine expansion. where Ciri rocks up as a more established Witcher and meets Geralt in his house. I think we'll sort of find out a little bit more about what she's been up to, a little bit more about her training, so that we can go into the Witcher Four with a more established hero.

Samuel
27:31
I fucking love the idea of a ten-year-old game getting new DLC. Oh like new single player DLC. I love that shit. Like it's If if they did the same thing with Metal Gear Solid 5 tomorrow, I'd be like fucking yeah, let's go GTA. Yeah, that'd be so good. So I I think that's a really cool idea. And everyone's got this game sat in that library, you know what I mean

Matthew
27:52
And that's the thing, they've they've made sure it's playable on like every modern platform. I mean, th the other thing that that little income blip could be is they've just made like a fancy switch two edition of it. Um, which it could also be that, which would be less exciting. And there is also maybe some risk in robbing the Witch of Four of some of its oomph. if you get to s play as a bit of Siri now as well. I could understand people not wanting that. Four is gonna be her game. Let's just treat it like that. Let's let's not do like a half-assed, you know, five hours as her now I I say take it with a pinch of salt. We have pulled all of these out of our asses. Yeah. It's really important to emphasize that.

Samuel
28:34
But they are sculpted from salt. Salty statues that collapse if uh touched with in it with any vigorousness.

Matthew
28:44
Under the power washer of truth and time.

Samuel
28:48
Okay, my number two Matthew is 007 First Light will land in the low 80s on Metacritic. Some critics will complain the gunplay isn't as good as other third-person shooters. And the stealth isn't as good as Hitman, but the mix of elements will capture people's imaginations and the story will go down really well. So, mmm, definitely one of our most anticipated games this year. Definitely the one as well that's got the potential to go a bit wonky because IO Interactive has never made a great third person shooter, and that is absolutely part of what they've made here. The last time they made a third person shooter was 17 years ago, so it's been a little while. So I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt to some extent there. Um I'm sure most of the studio making this had nothing to do with the 2K and a Lynch games, for example. But I really want this game to be good. Yeah, but I still think this is This feels like this is where it's going to me. It's definitely not gonna be a nines or tens kind of game. It's gonna be a sort of I'm really glad they did this. Um and uh and it sh it shows like the highs of the game are really high. And then every now and then people will be a bit like, eh, about something in it. So um what do you think, Matthew, to that edition?

Matthew
29:56
I mean I will say in the run-up to them showing off the game There were occasional rumblings that this wasn't necessarily in the best place this game. Like I was expecting something quite disastrous and actually what they showed I was really up for and quite excited about. It is a huge leap from what is good about Hitman to like what is good about a game like Uncharted, which this seems more in the mold of in terms of its set pieces and its ambition and Those games, they really trade on the absolute peerless level of polish and quality. And I felt like what they've shown of this so far still had a little way to go. in terms of that. Like it looked a little bumpy around the edges, even though I love the ambition of it. I I think what you've predicted for this is sounds like the most likely outcome for this game. for sure, but I think the I think the kind of quality of the James Bondness of it is gonna really carry it. I think they've really, really nailed that. That's the thing that excites me most about the trailers. like the car and the look of it and the sound of it and just the the tone of that world and we know that IO work in this sort of sort of cinematic r register almost, like their version of the world always feels like incredible set design on a movie rather than like real life and that's exactly where Bond should live. So I'd love it to be a ten out of ten, but I um predicting similar to to what you've said there.

Samuel
31:22
Yeah, fingers crossed. Um it's been five years since Hitman 3 as well. So I'm excited just to play a new IO interactive game and see uh see what the deal is. What's the number three, Matthew?

Matthew
31:31
Well I'll I'll bring up this is lower down my list, but I'll bring it up as a as a as a shitty continuation of your hit of your James Bond point. Hitman will mark the release of James Bond First Light. uh with an elusive target based on Alec Trevelyan from Goldeneye cleverly reusing the character model from Sean Bean's first elusive target.

Samuel
31:52
I love that because they've already done um La Chief, haven't they? Played by Maz Mikkelsen.

Matthew
31:56
Exactly. So why not? I I I think there's got to be more bond in in Hitman's feature. Yeah, did you do the LeShef one by the way? Yeah I did. Yeah.

Samuel
32:05
It was really good. That was like a great free two or three hours of game. I I had a great time. Yeah, I I like this one. I like the idea of you just gotta like go into that same character model, add a scar, and then you're done, send it to press. Um, and you th you predict they'll get um scene being back for this one do you Matthew?

Matthew
32:21
Yeah to do a little bit more voice work. They've already scanned him. You don't have to scan him again. That's the that's the big thing. Like most people have only really got one scanning in them, I imagine. And then they're like come on give me a break. I can't I can't get in that machine a second time. Saying that, then I was looking at the upcoming schedule and obviously they've got Miller, Judgeovic. coming up as an elusive target in February, which is maybe a little close to release for this to come true.

Samuel
32:49
Oh I guess because it was originally planned for March and it's coming out in Uh yeah, it's now coming out in May. I don't know. Okay, well we'll see how that goes down.

Matthew
32:58
But uh I didn't do the MM one that they did before Christmas. Yeah, I forgot to. That's because you're offended by his lyrics, isn't that isn't that? No, it's not that. It sounds like you were working for Eminem to kill his persona of Slim Shady. Yeah

Samuel
33:14
Yeah, it sounds a bit like the uh back in the day that they did an Eminem and the Punisher team-up comic, uh Marvel did. And I read I read it on Marvel Unlimited and um and it was deeply uh late nineties uh slash two thousand early two thousands coded. Um but is that we missed that one now then, can we not go back and play it?

Matthew
33:32
Yeah, I think it finished on the 31st of December. I just had such a manic December, I didn't have a chance to sit down and murder the real Slugshold. Oh, I hate when that happens. Isn't that the worst thing about the holiday period where you don't have time to merge it? I mean it's it's kind of brilliant, but it's also bonkers, because I guess a lot of celebs don't want to be killed. You don't want to go in the game and be like You're some such a sort of weapons grade asshole that you have to be murdered by this guy. So that one lets you have like one good MM and a bad MM to kill.

Samuel
34:04
Uh yeah, I wish I'd given that a go too. Maybe they'll add it so you can play in the elusive target arcade or something. I don't know. That's um I'll keep an eye on that Matthew Alright, um so it comes to my third prediction. Yes. Um which is my only Nintendo one actually, Matthew. Um and I wonder it's so it's very Matthew Castle coded this one. Um Nintendo launches the Switch 2's version of Splatoon or Arms, an original and expensive looking exclusive that maybe showcases what some of its younger designers can do. Brackets, some of these designers may already be in their forties. And uh also in brackets, um, but one that's better than drag and drive. So um those are my that's my prediction there. So I think that we're still due this really. We're still due the big new thing. You could say the Donkey Kong was this to some extent, but I don't think it'll be the only thing they have in the tank necessarily. I don't think they're gonna do another Splatoon anytime soon because they've done this free upgrade for um Splatoon 3. Well Splatoon's getting a single player game. Oh right.

Matthew
34:59
What's the uh in 2026

Samuel
35:02
Incredibly ill-informed here. Oh well that'll be why I missed it.

Matthew
35:10
Yeah, but they apparently it's a proper standalone single player game I guess but with the mechanics of Splatoon, which is kind of like a good Mario sunshine, maybe. Yeah.

Samuel
35:19
How did I miss this that th that this happened? I've no idea. Okay. Uh does the wider world know about this?

Matthew
35:25
Is this uh is this a It hasn't made much of a mark. Like I don't think they put it out with like any great trailer or anything, you know? Like I th This game only exists in your imagination, really. Like it's it's you teaming up with all the weird characters from Splatoon, which, you know, I know some people are really into, those guys. Uh in a quiet taste.

Samuel
35:45
Well what do you what do you think of this prediction though? The idea that something else that switched to original?

Matthew
35:50
I hope it's true. I I do think Dragon Drive was meant to be a a bit of this. Not a game I've given like a huge amount of time to, I must admit. So The thing it could be, or the interesting mystery project. Which is known about is the Nintendo did this big online beta for a some kind of MMO thing. It's under NDA, it has leaked what it is, and it's like a kind of like a very co I mean mine Minecraft can already be cooperative, but like a very cooperative Minecraft game where You're all in the same world, but you seem to be responsible for building in a small part of that world, and it's about placing cubes and building these like towers Okay. If that somehow manifests as something like it to look at the images of it, you don't go, oh yeah, that looks like it's gonna be a Pitmin game. Like the Avatar is this sort of generic egg man. Uh So yeah, that i maybe that could be the next big thing.

Samuel
36:52
Yeah, I suppose it might be. I mean all kinds of Nintendo games are clearly being announced now without me paying proper attention to them even happening, which is It's very hard to keep on top of this stuff because they whisper them to you through like a Like a very niche app. Yeah, I'm still very dependent on the Nintendo Directs for my Nintendo information, so um that's t that's tough for me.

Matthew
37:12
It's more it's quite a frustrating thing because you think oh maybe I'll see a new game today and you go on the app and it's like here's a picture of Cranky Kong and you're like oh fuck it I didn't want to see that you know I wanted a new game imposters Or we've added a track from Pilot Wings to the music app. What a waste of time, it's such a big mix It's a bit like when they used to do that website where they had one new update on Smash Brothers on the Wii every single day. Oh yeah. And some days it would be a new character and it would feel like Jackpot, this is so exciting, or a new stage. But then another day it would be like It's a Spring from Sonic and he'd be like Great.

Samuel
37:54
I'm reading about a frickin' spring. That is the most Matthew Castle ass experience. The idea of checking this Smashbury site every day. That is so 2007 Staff Writer coded that.

Matthew
38:04
Well that I mean that was Part of my daily routine on Endgame was to get in, sit down, check the site, and then start taking the screenshots off the site so that we could use them in the magazine for that month's Smash Brothers update.

Samuel
38:16
Yeah, it's a bit like someone saying, Oh yeah, we've announced our new game but it's on MySpace And you're like, Well I didn't even know that was a thing anymore. Um or when my parents send me a meme through Facebook and I'm like, I'm not looking at that. You know, I don't I don't want to, um so I'm not going to Related to our other perfor other um announcement, Matthew, they announced the uh 007 PC specifications and the recommended PC hardware requirements which require a 3060 Ti and 32 gigs of RAM. Um will get you 1080p at 60fps. So my other prediction I'm gonna amend here is that the Switch 2 version of this game will look like the Game Boy version of um Jamespawn that we've Talked about lovingly on this podcast many times. Um so yeah, we'll see how that pans out. What's your next prediction, Matthew?

Matthew
38:57
To help fill the gap before the next proper God of War, there will be a spin-off game. Either a 2D Metroidvania or a VR game for PSVR2. Hmm, very informed one this, because it's been rumoured, right? It has been rumoured that they've been Recruiting for a God of War style project, there's been a lot of rumors about something in the works that isn't the next mainline God of War. the idea that maybe it will have a bit of a similar reboot or something that it had, you know, in twenty seventeen. So the two D Metrovania thing, which I've definitely sort of seen around, that makes sense in my head. Like a Prince of Persia. Fallen was it Fallen King? Is that right?

Samuel
39:42
What the Prince of Persia game that I really like that one. Yeah, what's that called? Uh The Lost Crown.

Matthew
39:47
The Lost Crown. F I always think it's called The Fallen something. Prince of Persian with Lost Crown. I could see that sort of sized game. Those kind of production values. I'd be up for that. Alternatively, I was just thinking of like what other kind of things, sort of smaller things, could you do with God of War that would make sense and I I do like the f you know, the first person VR I've got an incredibly realistic sword and axe in each hand and I'm like lopping off like physics-enabled limbs. You know, plus God of War, old God of War had a couple of moments where we like, you know, went into people's heads to see people getting absolutely destroyed. So maybe like a little first person Kratos alike, maybe something in that time period too. Like older God of War. Just like throw a bone to the the old school, like remember when he was a fucking maniac and he lived in a more video gamey video game? Either of these ideas would be more like that.

Samuel
40:43
Is that our most like toxic perspective on this podcast that we're like Ditch Ditch the empathetic parent Kratos. Yeah. Well I know please go back to punching Zeus in the face over and over again.

Matthew
40:58
I think there's a clear enough divide between those two eras that you You could make something set in that era with the tone of that era and it it wouldn't be shocking to people. No. You know, they'd understand like, well he got older and he changed and then it became a different series. I think if you tried doing that older era of God of War, but with uh you know, the more sort of psychological depth of the new God of War, I think it would be jarring and weird and bad.

Samuel
41:25
So It will it would, but it was just like a very trashy blockbuster, that was the thing. So I agree, it was there was something to them. Like they there is no other game that's quite like them. It's just it really did not take itself that seriously at all. Um it and it was just great fun for doing so. Like it's not even comparable to something like Gears, where Gears will be very sincere and take itself quite seriously in moments, so you just have to kind of go along with it. God of War was a bit like, what is the coolest or most disgusting or most entertaining thing that could happen at any given moment? And then It would happen, but then some puzzles would happen in between basically. That was the game.

Matthew
42:10
That is the problem, yeah.

Samuel
42:11
There are it will also lead you to some moments that cannot be defended on the record. Like, absolutely, yeah. Uh okay, Matthew, my next prediction. Star Wars GLI3 is unveiled this year, probably at the Game Awards then launches in spring 2027. Okay, so um this is a pretty productive studio at respawn. Um they had they made uh Jedi Fallen Order that came out in late 2019 and then Jedi uh Survivor came out in uh spring twenty twenty-three. So less than four years they made that game. It stands to reason, I think, then that four years is that is as long as it will take them to make this one. And um yeah, so I think that revealed at the end of the year, short marketing campaign, EA loves a bit of that. Um I think that will probably happen this year.

Matthew
42:58
Thoughts, Matthew? I mean I hope it happens. Absolutely love that last game. Stick Asmussen has left a guy respawn. So I am interested like what happens there. That's the only tiny question mark over this for me.

Samuel
43:12
Yeah, I can see that. I'd I'd like to think they've got a a succession plan of that studio or whatever, but um And obviously I can't wait to see what uh game Stig makes for Wizards of the Coast. Probably something with rad uh third person combat and set pieces in it. So uh yeah. What's your f next prediction, Matthew?

Matthew
43:28
My number five is Wii games will be added to Switch 2 Virtual Console. Some using mouse control to replace the pointer functionality. Ooh, I really like this one. I just wonder if uh if how bespoke the remote and nunchuck were makes this not doable in terms of you'd actually have to go in and and do like some work to make these controls work. If you think about the Marad Galaxy 1 and 2 the idea of mapping the pointer to motion controls and getting that right. My idiot have never made a game brain tells me, well you just take the thing that you did in Mario Galaxy and just put it into any other Switch game, obviously. But I know that it isn't as easy as that. And I c I kind of struggle to picture them putting out something which has got loads of like Wii remotes popping up in it when you don't have a Wii Remote in your hand. That feels very un-Nintendo to me that would sort of set their teeth on edge a little bit, like the right the the dys the disjointedness of that experience. But GameCube and Wii are so similar a as at a technical level that you feel like well the Switch 2 could c the Switch could comfortably do this. And there's a library of some great games in there. And there's some things which, given that they've been quite hot on the franchises which are popular and still big and current. They've remade some of them, they've got a lot of them on other Switch Online services. You know, I feel like they've tried to keep as much of the back catalogue there as possible. So like It's more for things like fire emb you know, the Wii fire emblem. There's no reason for that to be stuck on Wii forever. Like that just has button controls. You know, it that's kind of where that thinking comes from. The pitch of on this console you can play every Metroid. The the beat the piece of the puzzle that is missing is the Wii other M and I think that'll be the same for l you know increasing number of franchises where you're like, the only thing we don't have is the Wii one and That is a bit unsatisfying.

Samuel
45:29
Yeah, the only thing that made me wonder would they do this is that uh the a a bunch of the Wii games either have been ported or have uh successor games like there is a a Wii Sports like game on um Switch. Can't remember the name of it, Matthew. Something something sports resort or something. I can't remember. But that came out and so you can go play that. But I still think that the original Wii Sports experience with that with that music and those sound cues and stuff would go down well. Um so I could see them adding that just for posterity, really. I guess the question is like how big does the download get at a certain point? Because they put uh they were like quite you know, they're on DVDs, quite quite significant in terms of the dema the space it might take up on your switch, but if I had to ask you off the dome, what would be like the three you c actually you've named two there really already, Fire Emblem and other M. Would you chuck anything else in there as like uh I really wish they could get this? It's not been re-released, but they should really get this onto the on the other.

Matthew
46:25
I mean the the one which they could n like never do, but I wish had a second life somewhere is Zack and Wiki. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But Crapcom might But the Wii Remote is like it's literally baked into the game, like it's a visual device in the game that looks like the Wii Remote, and that I don't think you can just replace. The actual physicality of the remote and the way you hold it and the way you manipulate it is key to some of the puzzles, so that just feels like a no-no. Little King's story, I'd like to have the best version of that. That's only ever had a sort of bad remake and slightly uh shaky sort of PC port. So uh having access to that would be good.

Samuel
47:05
Yeah, okay. That's good. Those are good suggestions. I hope it happens. And uh I hope Doshin the Giant gets added to the GameCube selection as well this year, Matthew. Um five is this year's most tedious gaming discourse will be the price of Ram. Expect lots of LinkedIn posts from boring motherfuckers. This is actually kind of already happening um as we speak really. But uh something to do with RAM and AI and the price of graphics cards. I mean I just I want to go to sleep really. It is important, but I don't I'm not interested. Um so so there it is. Um and uh yeah, anything that becomes vaguely talked about sparks a wave of buffoons on LinkedIn just posting the most bad faith takes you've ever seen for engagement. I do but um we what where else can we congratulate ourselves when we get in the Guardian Matthew? Where do we go?

Matthew
47:52
I only do that because I I hope one day someone in Portland will see that post and then buy the podcast or give me a job.

Samuel
48:00
That is brutal for the forty-five people who've already liked your post. Um because I get told every time someone likes it.

Matthew
48:06
Oh well I I haven't I even look I'm not saying that important person isn't in there or that those people aren't important. I actually haven't looked at that list of people, so I'll do that after this podcast. If you like that post, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Okay, Matthew, what's your next one? Uh this is my most boring one, but I felt like uh maybe it'll come up elsewhere in the last one. Well it's my most boring one too, so we can just Uh I just stole this one completely off the internet, but it sounds about right. Uh Half-Life 3 will release alongside the Steam Machine. To show that it is capable of playing the latest and greatest games. So it's not just that it will release, but the philosophy behind it I think will be to show a sort of set a bar of like what you t can expect from Steam Machine, which will probably be quite useful for people to have.

Samuel
48:53
Yeah, it's funny because back in the day, I feel well, I would say every year up until twenty twenty five, anytime there was a Half-Life 3 rumor, it's a bit like Sharp actually, this is just dumb. But then there were so many last year. It just intensified so much. I think like HLX uh references to HLX were fine found in the code for one of the Valve games that I didn't play like Dota or something, I can't remember which one. And then um yeah that you're right they've revealed they've revealed hardware so you could kind of see them happening as a pair, right?

Matthew
49:23
Yeah, I just feel like the history of this this series has been tied to like in roundabout ways, like there's something else that you're that you're trying to achieve with it. I well well I mean this is this is my very fucking hazy PC knowledge speaking here, but you know, I associate Half-Life 2 with them trying to get me to engage with Steam the first time round and then Half-Life Alex to get you to buy their VR headset. It's kind of that thinking I don't know if that's broad or incorrect.

Samuel
49:53
No, I thought about I thought about including this one as well for the simple reason that when they did put out the Steam Deck, they created that little game um that was based on Portal. an aperture labs. Come on, what it's called, an aperture test chamber or something like that. Um I I think it kind of makes sense they would do something that goes along with the hardware. And I do think that the next Half-Life game will will Look really nice, but it I don't think it'll be like the best or the it well, it won't be the best looking or most expensive looking game. Right. It will j but it'll be it will look beautiful, but it won't be like We spent 500 million making this. It'll be like a really good first person game that looks nice and yes, like you say, showcases um how Source Engine could be used on a variety of hardware, how it scales really nicely depending on the hardware you've got. So I think that's a good prediction, Matthew.

Matthew
50:44
I mean it is based on a lot of things I've seen doing the rounds, but that's right. I just want this thing to come out, not because I'm particularly looking forward to it. I will happily play it, of course. You know, I'm sure it'll be great. But just to put a stop to the the talk around it, th I'd say after the Hollow Knight fans, the worst the worst fan base for the sort of online hype and the obsession with rumors and You know, living your life to the schedules of like we think it's happening on this random day, and then they get to the day and then they're really disappointed, and then it's Oh but then actually if we flip this message upside down, maybe we had the month and the day the wrong way round and it's actually this day and next month and I I'm like, you just got better things to be doing. No game is good enough to to make a fool of yourself that way. And you do make a fool of yourself by by being so excited for something after all this time.

Samuel
51:37
Well you know me Matthew, I like any prediction that also takes a dunk on uh a dick something.

Matthew
51:43
Twenty-six drive bys for twenty twenty-six.

Samuel
51:46
That's paid out to me.

Matthew
51:49
Also, I think Valve need it f st Steam is like increasingly depressing to me. Is it? B both in terms of its functionality. Yeah, I find it as an actual user experience, it's getting like increasingly messy and unpleasant to use. like just the fucking awful tagging of games. You just see more and more about the total lack of like moderation on the the comments and the reviews and It it does bump me out that, you know, this company that used to make some of the best games going now basically just run like a big racist shop. Like some of the stuff that is allowed. At least a bit of a bit of taste in the mouth. You're like, I wish there was some competition, but there's never gonna be.

Samuel
52:30
I definitely get where you're coming from. They have this non-interventionist stance on everything, which means that Yeah, people can just review bomb things at will and there's no real control over it and all kinds of dog shit games end up on there. They've definitely got like a A fairly robust system for them not getting into most visible spaces on there. But uh yeah, the reviews are like It's like looking at a public like a National Express coach toilet after a stand dude. Like that's and like the people who write joke reviews on Steam, I've said this before. lowest it's down the it's it's down there with Mrs. Brown boys as like lowest grade comedy like ever. Like people who make jokes in students as like Um but I think I actually think that compared to what I remember of it ten years ago, the interface is quite contemporary feeling. It's quite I like all of its different features, like the wish listing and stuff. I I like opening it up when I turn my PC on. It feels a little less kind of like stuffily PC based than it did when I w in my early days a PC gamer. I do I do like it as a as a platform in terms of narrative.

Matthew
53:38
You know, when it when it was the last you know, Nextfest, which, you know, is a good thing and I'm glad that they do it. You know, the fact that I'm trying to find a load of detective games and it's giving me 3D platformers under the detective genre, I'm like, what's going on here? Something is going wrong on this platform.

Samuel
53:53
Yeah.

Matthew
53:54
You know, it isn't offensively shit, but there is something irritating about it. It's not perfect, given that it's the thing which like no one else can make a dent on.

Samuel
54:04
Well yeah, I mean I I will tell you uh d to illustrate your point somewhat here, you cannot buy um the game Horses that came out uh late last year um to reheat an old discourse. And you cannot play the game Devotion made by the developers of Nine Souls. Those are games you cannot play on there. Here are three games you can buy on Steam. Hentai vs. Furries, that's 89p right now. Um hentai weed puzzles, that's 89p as well. And Daenerys doesn't want hentai, that's 99p. So I think that does prove your point. to some extent. There's even Thank you for sharing your wish list with us by the way. Oh fuck you. Okay. Um here was me trying to back you up and and you saw it right there. You were like, it's on the b I'm gonna step up to the plate. Knock this out of the arena. Uh fair enough. Okay, um we move on then. Um because this is starting to get a bit too serious as an exercise, and that's not what we're here for. Okay, this is quite a boring one. Um, we will finally see a wave of haze light like couch co-op games this year as projects start to development after It Takes 2 start to see the light of day. Orbitals is just the start, expect to see three or four more of them this year. It just feels like this is the we talked about this before, it's just the most the biggest open goal. People want those couch co-op experiences. They want them to have nice graphics, fun mini games, um, a story that carries you along. And I just think that the undeniable massive success of It Takes Two was bound to have got people a bunch of funding back during the um the big COVID money times and yeah Orbitals is one of those but there'll be more. What do you think Matthew?

Matthew
55:36
Yeah, I I love this as well. Um I hope they all do the haze like thing of Yeah, that'd be good. So straight up It's like a huge goodwill exercise and in it. those kind of things into account.

Samuel
55:56
Hmm, I think so. Um what's your next one, Matthew?

Matthew
55:59
My next one oh this is really this might be my shittest one actually. This is really niche. And it's probably a repeat of my Wii Virtual Console one. I think Trauma Center will return using switch two mouse controls. Also mouse controls on PC. Uh yeah, I don't know why this is. Well I'll tell you why it is. I read a lot of the You know you get those articles at the start of the year where they ask loads of Japanese developers about like their hopes for the next year. Oh, I love those. That's like the best. I really love those. And I I tend to use them for like most of the predictions. The Ninja Gaiden one instantly. I just felt like he was desperate to say we're making a fourth one in his interview last year. That's where that came from. That's where my Nostradamus scene came from. Persona guys this year as well are doing doing similar, I feel like. Definitely the persona f for remake as more of a thing, but I I felt like a lot of them were sort of saying don't maybe expect more metaphor e fantasio type stuff and maybe don't you know I felt like they were saying like not this and not really that and I don't know why I've taken that as a oh well that means Trauma Center will come back. But I just think there'd be a lot of love for it. I think the temptation of making these niche games is to get them on platforms which are absolutely massive. Like that's what basically drove Trauma Center to begin with. It was a game that could only be on the massive selling DS and then a game that could only be on the massive selling Wii. They should just take a punt on it and Uh maybe going against that is the fact that Atlas seem to release everything on everything, you know, even like, you know, they're still releasing everything on PS4 and they're just uh hedge your bets, the company. I don't know, true Trauma Center, I'd just I'd love this to come back. It was such a fun, weird arcade game and I think like the appetite for Atlas's particular, you know, like illustration style and music and story and just like vibe and tone and uh I know I think people would go for it. And I also just want games that use the mouse. I just want something to use the mouse a bit interestingly.

Samuel
58:02
Yeah, that does feel like it it it's got the risk of being the lost feature of the console if um you know i it it could just happen in the way that the you know, the screen for the the gamepad for the Wii U just sort of died out a little bit or I mean I feel like there are plenty of examples of this over the years for n with Nintendo. But um yeah, okay. That's cool, Matthew. I I would like to see our series come back because It was super interesting and I think there is a lot of millennial goodwill towards it as well. Um so yeah, okay. Um all right, well, my seventh one. This will be a huge year for turn-based tactics games. Expect that to be a narrative coming out of this year between Star Wars Zero Company, um Menace from the developers of Battle Brothers, which looks a little bit like a mix of XCOM and Mass Effect, but it's a turn-based game and Fire Emblem, Fortunes Weave of course. No Thoraxis XCOMs means there's still a spot for something a bit shinier. in that PC space. So yeah. I think the genre will have a big year, Matthew. Any thoughts on this?

Matthew
58:58
I'm up for it. We're definitely, you know, g gonna play well I actually hadn't heard of the Malice one, but I'll play the Star Wars one and Fire Emblem for sure. Um Menace. Oh, did I say or did I say Malice, right? Yeah. Um memorable name clearly. Yeah. So this is this is gonna be this year for tactical strategy games that last year was for visual novels basically.

Samuel
59:22
Yeah, that's kind of why I I I I think it'd just be cool to see this genre have a moment. I think plenty of them do come out, but the ones where they spent a bit of money on the graphics is what I'm really looking for. Or have something else going on a bit different mechanically. Like Like how Midnight Suns had the pinging enemies into the environment and to enemies into each other kind of stuff. Like that's the sort of thing I'm looking for. So uh

Matthew
59:42
It's like it's like the pudding or the dessert for having like eaten your vegetables and done like the hard thinking in the round. You do all that heavy lifting and then it's like, here's something really awesome for you to watch.

Samuel
59:54
No, I appreciate you putting it in terms of I can understand Matthew, that's uh that's really that's Do you understand that?

Matthew
59:58
Understand that, you pudding lover.

Samuel
01:00:01
I do, me the pudding lover who's got all the hentai games and a steam wish list. Absolutely, what a disgusting picture you're painting of yourself this episode.

Matthew
01:00:10
Okay, what's the what's your eighth prediction, Matthew? The Game Awards, Game of the Year Award nominations will be as follows. Here are the five games that will be up for Game of the Year Award. Alright. GTA 6, Dusk Bloods on Switch 2. Fable, Resident Evil Requiem, and an indie game that we currently don't know about.

Samuel
01:00:34
That's I love this. That's a great suggestion It does it does have like the the echo of truth to it. But there's quite a lot do you not think that something like Forza Horizon 6 or Saros ended up on the list?

Matthew
01:00:51
highest scoring games of the year. Yeah. Uh but I think racing games always get overlooked and fucked over in these kind of awards. That's true. Saros feels to me like it could be the I don't wanna because we're doing fancy critic this year, so I don't wanna like show my hands. Too early.

Samuel
01:01:10
Uh fair enough, Matthew. Um, okay. So uh yeah I do like that. I did uh well the one thing I will pull out of that, I do agree that The indie game thing is gonna be something we don't know about yet. Like that that feels like it happens every year where there's like one thing that just like comes along and is huge. Um I keep an eye on Kepler Interactive since they seem to be making quite a few of these these days, you know.

Matthew
01:01:30
So uh Yeah Kepler and Play Stack are like The I I would basically call the fifth game of the year slot, the Kepler play stack uh uh w and it's one of their games will be in there. Is it gonna be the recoin? I don't know if the two P dropping machines is maybe just a little bit too odd and British sea psychoded, you know.

Samuel
01:01:55
Yeah, we'll see. Um okay, um I do like but I I agree that it could be just something out of nowhere as well. And I'm curious to see how how the indie landscape shapes up this year. I really when I was making a big list of games to keep an eye out for, Ken, I obviously want to play that's coming out at the end of January, but I couldn't look beyond that in any massive detail because these things always do just seem to sort of roll along um out of nowhere. So um yeah. Okay Matthew, my eighth prediction is the first episode of Hideo Kajuma's Xbox game OD drops out of nowhere, probably in June, at the usual Xbox showcase. Again, no insight behind this whatsoever, just a guess. But it feels like the sort of thing you might do. It also seems like it's in a slightly more advanced state than I realized it was, because I assumed that while they were making Death Strounding 2. They wouldn't really have um capacity to make uh much else. But I guess I have no idea how many people work at that studio or how long they were polishing Death Stranding too. Yeah. But um I mean they've shown off a fair chunk of it now and it does look a bit um PT ish, but I think each episode's gonna be a bit different. So the idea of a shorter horror game, probably coming out of nowhere, um, like this, could be a big moment. Big moment to get people Signing up to Game Pass, playing it or whatever. What do you think of this one Matthew?

Matthew
01:03:06
Yeah, I'm my only worry is that he's scrambling to replace old Udo Kier. I think he said he'd done all the filming for that. So Oh okay. Well in which case then that's that's fine. Um well it's not fine, it's obviously sad. Um I thought this felt like a little bit of like you know, what the hell is this? Is it gonna have any shape to it? But that last sort of trailery thing they put out, which actually had a first person perspective and weird things happening in front of you, I was like, Oh, that actually looks like a bit of a game I can imagine myself playing so Yeah, I'm I'm into it. He talks a big game at the moment, Kojima, you know, between this and um physint or whatever it is, the than the Metal Gear one.

Samuel
01:03:47
I do like the idea that not all of these games will take six years to make as well. Um because, you know, uh it's It's just nice to have a a steadier cadence of these things. Um so yeah, I kinda hope it is shorter really. I hope it's not but Death Strange 2 seemed like it was a pretty much uh Here's my all encompassing masterpiece of a game, um, kind of a project. Whereas yeah, I I wouldn't mind something that's more in the vein of like four or five hours, but lots of different cool things or unexpected things happen in that time. So

Matthew
01:04:24
Well yeah. That's kind of what I was alluding to.

Samuel
01:04:26
I mean I don't want it to I wanted to you know get maybe four or five out the door before he croaks to be honest. That's my personal hope. But uh yeah. What's your number nine, Matthew?

Matthew
01:04:35
My number nine is Uh Tomodachi Life, Living the Dream, will be a social media phenomenon and will lead to it being a massive breakout hit on Switch 1 and 2.

Samuel
01:04:47
Hmm, interested.

Matthew
01:04:48
I could see the I could see the possibility here, yeah. Tomodachi Life, for people who don't know it, is kinda like I don't want to say it's Nintendo's The Sims, but It's sort of a halfway house between Animal Crossing in The Sims in that you make a little me and they move into an apartment or it was an apartment block in the l in the last game and other Me's move in, other people, I think you can make like celebrity me's to live with. And then There are like mini-games and light actions to do. You kind of like govern their lives rather than like directly controlling each of them individually. And it's more about seeing how they interact with each other, but it has this weird quirk in that all the dialogue is sort of done through like speech synthesis, a bit like Microsoft Sam, you know, or the TikTok voice. So they all talk in this weird robot voice. So if you imagine an Animal Crossing where all the characters said all the weird shit in a slightly weird voice. It was incredibly funny back in the day and I just feel like had this happened in the era of TikTok and Instagram and you know, social media was already big but particularly people sharing video more readily. I think it it has the potential to just be massive. People making all these weird celebrities, mashing them up, filming them saying weird shit to each other. You can r in the DS game you could like write songs that they'd then sing to each other and all this kind of stuff. It's it's a really strange sort of dreamlike game and I feel like the social media savvy youngsters are just gonna have a whale of a time with it and that is gonna just like explode it as a thing.

Samuel
01:06:31
I think people want to I think people want to get off of all the social media platforms they're already on as well. Any excuse to bin those off and Maybe engage with a slightly different space, probably quite welcome, you know.

Matthew
01:06:42
Maybe people will see more of a through line from Animal Crossing to this and that huge Animal Crossing audience. You know, maybe it has to sort of go somewhere. You know, like a you know, Animal Crossing from 2020 can only hold your attention so long and some you know, maybe in a similar way to what you described with Marathon and Arc Raiders, maybe there'll be like uh a a massive influx of people from their Animal Crossing villages to this weird place where like your neighbour's Hitler and keeps bringing you baked beans or whatever.

Samuel
01:07:15
Oh yeah, I hate when that happens. Um yeah it's um that thing as well where Animal Crossing I know they've had they they've had or they're adding the update for Switch 2 But something in that specific mode of play, that kind of like more passive um experience, I think there's definitely room for something like that. that you can just play every single day on Switch too. So um not that, you know, and I know that I'm sure that you're playing the roguelike mode in uh Donkey Kong Bonanza every single um day, uh Matthew Anyway, but uh for you know for those normies out there who'd like something a bit more peaceful than a the big eight man smashing things up, but uh yeah.

Matthew
01:07:52
I mean you just know weird listeners are gonna make little me's of us and have them living in their game world. A

Samuel
01:07:58
Yeah, I look forward to being disturbed by that. That'll be a good experience for me in the Discord. this year. Um okay Matthew, so this is my one of my other boring ones actually. Um Konami unveils its first original Metal Gear Solid project. um since survive during 2026. So we've seen what they can do with Silent Hill. But I think that The other Konami franchises, they're bound to do something with those. Um, you know, I guess you could also say that Metal Gus or Delta um Snake Eater was maybe uh them gesturing at Doing something in with metal gear again, doing something new um with metal gear. So I think that this will happen. What form that takes? I'm not totally sure. I don't know if they would go whole hog and try and do Metal Gear Solid 6 and then it's like another prequel or something. Or if it's like a maybe an attempt to do something a bit more kind of retro, like maybe you do something Focused on handheld play where it plays a little bit like the old Metal Gear games, but it looks quite new and shiny. That's the sort of thing I could see. Konami dabbling with, but I do think at some point they're gonna, you know, I I feel like that the Delta remakes seem like it did pretty well. People seem pretty happy with it. So that HD collections Sold game busters as well. I think this is bound to be in the post. It's just a matter of when we see it break cover. What do you think, Matthew? I hope they do sort of get on with doing this.

Matthew
01:09:21
It's not so much I want to see them step out from the shadow of Kojima. Like we don't know if they can, but I'd like them to have a chance to show that they can. Like I feel like their narrative that there's only one person who can make these kind of games is not particularly great. Uh I'd just like to see them try, because we'll never know until we try, right? Yeah. It could end up that we have a situation like we have with Yakuza where the Yakuza team is still making excellent Yakuza games and Nagoshi is now probably going to make an excellent Yakuza rival Keep that space nice and spicy, have a little bit of competition in there, make sure everyone's on their A game. Yeah, I'm absolutely up for it.

Samuel
01:10:00
That's all I want from our game developers is for them to break off form new developers and have rivalries with our old companies. That's just the just the the old kind of like spike kind of rivalry. That's I live for that sort of thing. And I think you're right. We'll guess.

Matthew
01:10:12
Spike powers innovation.

Samuel
01:10:14
It really does. Um what's your tenth prediction Matthew?

Matthew
01:10:17
Forza Horizon 6 will eventually have a Fable expansion pack, letting you bound around Albion's fields and enjoy some magic-infused impossible racetracks. Uh on the flip side, I also think Fable have a forza parody in it where you collect loads of horses.

Samuel
01:10:38
I love this. It's the most Matthew Castle coded fucking prediction this. I mean It does feel like that makes sense though, right?

Matthew
01:10:45
I mean at least more of just a uh acknowledging that we're potentially in four a mega playground year. If they get both Forta Horizon 6, which you have to imagine is gonna be at the very least excellent, uh and fable, which I'm just praying it's good. If there's anything that I am gar gar over in the way that people are with like Half-Life, it's there being a good fable sequel. So no pressure playground, but I think they've got very, very smart people there.

Samuel
01:11:15
Look I look forward to driving my Audi around not whole island, Matthew, from Fable Two. That'd be a fun experience for me.

Matthew
01:11:21
Well I the thing is about the expansions, they often are like quite whimsical, you know, they did like the Hot Wheels where you're racing around real-life cars around mad plastic tracks in the sky and maybe the fable thing is is it's just too much of a different audience. to be of interest to the motorheads. I realise Hot Wheels has cars as a common ground and that Fable doesn't really have that. So I don't know. I'm losing confidence in this one the more I think about it.

Samuel
01:11:49
Um I'm a bit hazy on the um collect horses um bit of that prediction, but um I wanted to.

Matthew
01:11:56
It'll basically have the structure of Forza Horizon in it, but the joke will be that because there's aren't cars, it's just horses. So they'll talk about horses the way they talk about cars. And you'll be able to like mod your horses. And you know, there'll be like a horse festival, which is like for the Horizon Festival.

Samuel
01:12:15
And um you can program the horse to say your name while you're riding it as well, as it's a magic horse. So the horse will just name Murphy.

Matthew
01:12:24
If Fable doesn't use the You've got a hero's name and pi and NPC say it to you so when you like shit your pants. They're like, oh Matthew, just shit your pants Uh that and that will also be heartbreaking if that isn't the thing.

Samuel
01:12:37
You just shit your pants, Matthew. I can't believe you shit your pants, Matthew. Well I mean Fable Fable is st still such an unknown from this year as well. Like we've seen so little of it and um it feels like we're yeah, uh we're just waiting for that game to be broken wide open, so Yeah. I could see this. I mean they definitely think about the extended life of their games, don't they? So um yeah. Yeah.

Matthew
01:12:59
I think there'll be a I think there'll do there'll be some playful connective tissue between them.

Samuel
01:13:04
Yeah, exactly. Or maybe it's even if it's just like a it's like an NPC in Tokyo that's Peter Molody or something. No, I'm just being uh I'm just being silly, Matthew. Okay, my tenth prediction. At least one major formerly esteemed game creator will embrace generative AI this year and unveil some kind of horror show project that everyone hates. Um, I think we do this. I think someone who's Let's guess who it's gonna be. No, no, we definitely won't do that for legal reasons. But um someone in their fifties or sixties who who, you know, made a game that you really liked in the nineties or noughties, and they've just got some some money to do something not very good and um and everyone will just downvote it online and it'll be embarrassing for everyone involved. I just feel like this could even happen from the Japanese side of game development, I think. But I just think something like that's gonna happen. There'll be like a big moment where someone tries to make generative AI art happen and there'll be this big pushback. Um, because, you know, I don't think anyone who's working in game dev likes gen you know AI generated art specifically um without getting into the rest of what AI does. So um yeah um I think that I think that will happen Matthew any thoughts on this?

Matthew
01:14:16
Yeah, I know I feel like this uh a version of this happened towards the end of last year. Uh Hino who heads up uh level five they of Professor Leighton fame was like, I'm all in on AI and like the games are like 80% made by AI now, isn't that great? And everyone was like, fuck you So uh yes to yeah, I'm looking forward to like what happens when Professor Leighton comes out, if it'll get any like one out of tens on principle. Um There's gonna be a lot of that shit.

Samuel
01:14:50
I think there is, yeah. So I'm I'm almost certain this will happen. Just curious to see which which person it will be and yes, I refuse to make any guesses um for legal reasons. What's your eleventh pick, Matthew?

Matthew
01:15:01
Nintendo will mark the 15th anniversary, it's another anniversary, of Xenoblade Chronicles by bringing out Switch 2 editions of the entire trilogy and X.

Samuel
01:15:13
It feels like this is I mean, this is the most requested series to get upgrades that hasn't already got had had upgrades confirmed. Is that right? Do you think?

Matthew
01:15:23
Yeah, almost to the point that

Samuel
01:15:30
Yeah, I think so. They already did Zenabade Chronicles Definitive Edition. Like what How much sprucing up could you really do of I mean surely it's just like a performance patch needed for the other games?

Matthew
01:15:40
The the the odd one out in a way is is Zenoblade Chronicles 2 in that visually it's It's quite rough compared to the remake of one and three was such like an attractive step up I felt that it's like You know, is this something that just needs like a bit more heft behind it, or is it something that needs a more substantial pass to make it work? Like how how much of this is is you get away knowing the limitations of like how hazy it's gonna be and whatnot. So I've I've never seen it emulated on some crazy rig to see how good Uh Xenoblade Chronicles 2 can look, but that I'd say that is the the slight mystery of this. X, I was really annoyed that they didn't just announce uh Switch 2 version given they've just made this all singing, all dancing Switch 1 version because it's good looking on Switch 1, but you know that thing would probably sing on Switch 2. So I've got a copy of it, but I actually haven't played it much because I want to see the game. You know, I want I I'm I'm holding out for a Switch 2 version, which is probably an unhealthy way of doing it.

Samuel
01:16:46
Do you not think they're i they're likely to make something new this year, that studio, because won't it have been four years since the third w game? It's about time.

Matthew
01:16:54
Yeah, and and they are incredibly productive. I mean I hope so. I mean it's Xenoblade two felt like Two and then into three, you know, it felt like a like a miracle how fast those things happened. So yeah, I didn't predict that, but I'd love for it to happen. Yeah, obviously. Well, I mean that will be like a proper game of the year contender for me if it happens 'cause as long as it's not X2.

Samuel
01:17:19
If it I think one thing is for sure with this prediction is that if it is the fifteenth anniversary and they don't do anything I think it'll be that will establish how Nintendo feels about it. That'll fit establish where it is in the pecking order. If it if the event passes and nothing happens, I think it will just become another

Matthew
01:17:37
F-Zero or Star Fox where it just sort of exists passively. I'm well I'm obviously I say that I'm a fan of it. It feels like a huge part of the the Switch story to me.

Samuel
01:17:52
It is. And I I think like they've all sold. pretty well, but I don't think any of them are like ten million sellers, right? It's more of a three, four million seller kind of series. I might be wrong about that, but I think I think that is correct, but In any case, I hope for your sake that's um that it's um a huge year for Zenoblade Matthew. I didn't mean to bum you out with my response to your predictions. So uh yes. Okay, um my 11th pr eleventh prediction is um GTA 4 remastered happens this year in a similar fashion to the recent Red Dead redo and uh Red Dead Redemption 2 uh launches on PS5 to fill the void until GTA 6. My theory with the Red Dead remaster they did recently, which you can now play on your phone on Netflix, which I I honestly don't agree with the idea of that. Like that game I think that game is exquisite and should not be played with like touch screen controls. I know you can plug a controller in and Bluetooth a controller to your phone or whatever, but My pal um David Lynch came over from Japan um uh uh uh last month and was telling me about how how good Red Dead was when he played it on his tablet um using a little controller and I was like It's cool that you can do that, but um at the same time I just don't like the idea of, you know, people trying to play it with a touch screen. It seems perverse somehow. So what they did with that was they got a studio, I think it was double eleven, to port it to PC, and then about a year and a half later they put it on consoles as well. And so now you can play this shiny version of Red Dead on everything. Um I think they're gonna I think they're doing the same thing with GTA four is my my theory because there's a lot of money on the table there if you get that out before GTA six arrives. And um if you do it after GTA six, I think it's a bit weird. Like it's a bit it's almost like you missed your moment. And uh yeah, and they have done various things over the years to excavate bits of their catalogue, but this is a game where If you can do what they did with that Red Dead one, just get it at higher resolution, move all those assets a w over and and um you know, you you still have most of the radio stations intact as we'll discuss on the um the podcast. Not totally intact, but mostly. Then I think that could be just like a massive money maker for them. And Red Dead Redemption Um two on a next gen version of that's been rumored for a long time. All you really need to do there is get the PC version with its bells and whistles running on current um current hardware so that doesn't seem like as big a lift but what do you think of this? I mean I'd love the Red Dead

Matthew
01:20:16
Next two red next gen version, because that game on PC is still probably like the best looking video game I've ever seen. So yes please to that. I I mean if they do do GTA 4, I hope they add checkpoints to it. Well, I kind of hope they do, but also if they do, I'll feel pretty pissed off that I played through GTA 4 without checkpoints, so close to them releasing it with checkpoints. That's funny. It's by no means a Vice City or a San Andreas in terms of difficulty spikes, but It's I'd say it's enough of a thing for me to be like grumbling about it a lot of the time.

Samuel
01:20:52
All they need to do is add it so when you retry a mission, it doesn't start you at the location where you took the mission is It starts at the location where the mission actually starts. So you'd have to do the driving in between.

Matthew
01:21:02
That's the one thing they need to change, I think, and then sort it.

Samuel
01:21:06
But you know. Um and you could tweak the combat. I think there's a couple of longer missions where they could stick a checkpoint. But I I think San Andreas though, you can just make a bunch of quality of life updates in a similar vein to really improve the experience. Like When we played through San Andreas, that was a genuinely pleasurable thing because the they'd made so many changes to it that it was no longer a horrible nightmare like some of those missions were like it was It was just easier to play. It th like the shooting was easier. The combat was easier. It was more it felt more modern in the hands. And rather than feeling like they bastardized the work, I actually thought it just made it Palatable.

Matthew
01:21:42
And I think it's like no longer a horrible nightmare is a point from the box.

Samuel
01:21:47
Well like I d well the we both did that zero kind of turret mission with no incident, and that was the worst thing in the world on PST. So Th those ki I don't disagree with making those kinda tweaks. I think you absolutely can. So but GT4 also feels like the one that is the most like lost. Like it's not quite I know on PC and it's different and on Xbox if you've got a Series X or S you can play it backwards compatible, but PlayStation is where that massive GTA audience lives, right? You cannot play GT4 on anything on PlayStation except to PS3. It just feels like that is so much money waiting to be made, but it does also feel like you have to get out before six, because nothing else will matter after that. So um There it is Matthew. Um we'll see if it happens or not. But um yeah, I think they probably greenlit a bunch of these things when they realized GTA 6 was gonna take longer than they expected, and they just thought, oh shit, gotta make some money in between. So that's my prediction there as well. What's your final prediction?

Matthew
01:22:41
My final prediction, this is where it's like something really Oh, I mean it's been said several times. This is the most boring one. Nintendo marks Zelda's 40th anniversary by finally releasing that rumoured double pack of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess HD. Same deal as Galaxy 1 and 2 on the Switch, with a Switch 2 edition that's slightly shinier.

Samuel
01:23:03
I mean I'd love this. I think a two pack is the way to go after um they've already put Wind Waker on Switch Online, you know?

Matthew
01:23:09
It being there does make me think, do we really need Wind Waker HD when there's such an easy way of playing it and Wind Waker's, you know, pretty timeless and The HD version does definitely address some problems. Also, Twilight Princess HD, they could easily just knobble that by putting Twilight Princess, the GameCube version, on there, which actually I would treat as a bit of a get 'cause it's uh, you know, not the version that a lot of people owned. You know, it's it feels like a bit of a rarity to sort of play that game as it was originally intended without all the kind of wee stuff layered on top. So I don't know, maybe this one won't go anywhere.

Samuel
01:23:43
Well, I I mean I I hope this happens because it is easy money for Nintendo and I was very as discussed on a previous episode, I'm very grateful to get the chance to play. you know, something at the felt a bit lost like Mario Galaxy 2 did. So um yeah, it it feels it feels like this is a a bit of a not an if but more of a when situation. Hence I think this is like the third appearance that's made in these predictions episodes. So um Okay, my final prediction, Matthew. The release of Pragmata by Capcom will drive a lot of seven out of ten discourse, and Matthew Castle will get annoyed at people and misunderstanding the concept. of one of those sevens. Um I think this is definitely gonna happen with this game. Everyone's the calls calling it like 360 AF basically, um Pragmata. Definitely has that uh sort of like feel to it. Feels like it could be a game from twenty ten, but I mean that a complimentary way. And yeah, I think it will probably get defin F some people say, Oh, it's like one of those sevens because what, it's not an open world game or whatever the fuck. I don't know what people's criteria are for that sort of thing. But you will definitely get annoyed at people calling it a seven. Um because either it won't be a seven Or they won't understand what a one of those sevens actually is. What do you think of that?

Matthew
01:24:49
Yeah now that's uh on this I'm on firmer ground. Um I know where I stand on the sevens That's a core part of my value system. So yeah, I can see this happening. I either I I really like the the look of it. I haven't actually played the demo of it yet. So that's on my to-do list, but the fact that they stuck with it and given their pretty high bar for quality Capcom and like their, you know, decent track record you know, they must see the the value in it and must believe in it and that's kind of enough for me. Like if modern Capcom's behind it then I'm alright with that.

Samuel
01:25:27
Yeah, that makes sense.

Matthew
01:25:28
In essence the bit of modern Capcom that was also behind that dinosaur game, which I wasn't quite about.

Samuel
01:25:33
Oh, I quite enjoyed that. What's it called? Exoprimal? That feels so yeah, Exoprimal. That feels so memory holed now, doesn't it? That feels like that. That never happened, Exoprimal. But I spent I remember it was the the summer the summer that Dead Reckoning came out because I stopped playing Exoprimal and went to see Dead Reckoning. So that's that's why I linked those two things together. But yeah, it was good. It was good. Um okay, well those are the predictions, Matthew. So um a mix of the silly and the serious, but I was I think there's quite a lot of meat on the bones there in the end, so that was good. Should we take a quick break and come back with our fantasy critics picks, Matthew? Let's do it. Welcome back to the podcast. So this is uh some more frivolous nonsense to see us out, um as with last year. and possibly the year before, I don't really remember. We're gonna pick five games each and see which gets the highest uh score on Metacritic accumulatively um by the end of the year. Um so what that will mean is The lowest rated it is on a launch platform. Yeah, a launch platform's lowest rated version. That'll be the score we use. So For guess 82 on Xbox, 86 on PlayStation. We use the 82, etc. And then yeah, we'll add them up and um and see how it goes. We'll take it in turns. You got the the old coin toss app handy, Matthew, to decide who goes first? Let me get it up This is serious business.

Matthew
01:27:34
What do you fancy? Uh I'll take Tails. And Tails it is. Ooh. Okay. Uh well, we all know what we're gonna do, you motherfucker.

Samuel
01:27:48
Was there a reason that last year we didn't allow GTA 6 to be picked. Should we do that again this year and take GTA 6 out so it becomes a bit more competitive? No, I think it should be in the mix because it might not come out. Yeah, it might not come out. Um okay, I'm gonna go with um Forza Horizon 6, my first pick. Because I'm pretty certain this will come out 'cause they've already teased it. And I think they've I think they've already said it'll come out this year. And this is like one of the most dependable uh franchises going in games. Um there is like even more goodwill for it than ever after the PlayStation 5 release that just seem to keep seems to keep selling and selling. Um Forza Horizon 5 had 92 on Metacritic. Just feels like a really Yeah. Uh easy pick, straightforward. Um I don't mind Matthew taking GTA instead, that's fine with me. Like a like we say, it's coming out in November in in next year. Sorry, this year. It could easily slip again. So something a bit low risk makes sense, Matthew, doesn't it?

Matthew
01:28:41
Yeah. Uh no, it's a good pick. It's second on my list for sure. I just think it's like they'd have to go so wrong for it not to be good. They do, they do. Um so it feels like a dead set. What's your first big match? I am gonna gamble on GTA 6. Okay. I f I feel like it's gonna happen. Yeah, no it's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. This is gonna be the year it's gonna get like fucking ninety-five or something and uh Ye You know, it's it's gonna win me the fantasy critic draft.

Samuel
01:29:11
Um I wanna believe uh you know for your sake that that's gonna happen, so um that's fair enough. Uh my second pick is going to be uh Saros Um I think this will be a 90 plus game Returnal had 86 which is pretty strong. I think people will like this even more and understand what this studio is about. And it's definitely coming out. That that is really the lesson I've learned from previous drafts. Just take games that are actually coming out and don't risk it on re-animal. Um as may be the case. Um what's the next pick, Matthew?

Matthew
01:29:38
Well, I'm taking that lesson to heart and I'm betting on fable again. This is like this is the second year in a row I've guessed this.

Samuel
01:29:49
Um I think you bought did you guess it in like twenty-three or something? Did that be a little bit more?

Matthew
01:29:56
Yeah, that's right, yeah. But I am you gotta believe You know, it's a game about you know magic and amazing things can happen if you just believe in it and I you truly believe. Fable will come out in 2026. Yeah, okay. And it'll be good. That's the other gamble with this.

Samuel
01:30:15
Um it will be good. Okay, so I'm going to take um for my next one, bit unusual here, but it's out very soon. I'm gonna take Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. Because this series is so consistent with how it's reviewed. So the recent Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD remaster got 84 on Metacritic. Echoes of an Elusive Age, the Switch version of that got like 91. And it always scores between like high like mid 80s and like 90s. And so I think this looks really handsome. It's like one of the best looking uh sort of like three D you know, sort of like z juzged up versions of an old game I've seen. Like the art style is quite quite tasteful compared to some of the mana games that have come out in recent years, for example. I think this will really hit the spot, especially at a quiet time of year. So Feels like a safe bet, Matthew. What do you think?

Matthew
01:31:05
Yeah, that's that's great thinking. I'm really excited for this. I definitely want to play this. I thought the trade looked absolutely brilliant. I think it's just a little bit further along than you know the remakes of like one, two, and three, which are just so like old that even though they've jazzed them up. They feel like oldish as hell to me. And I don't know if you have to have like a little bit of you know nostalgia for those really old school JRPGs that I just I didn't really have back in the day. So Uh yeah. I am h willing this to be good because I'm looking forward to playing it. Okay, good stuff. So what's your third pick? I'm gonna take Of the big Catcom 3, I'm betting it all on Oni Musha Way of the Sword. I think that's the wise pick. You know, I think Pragmata, Resident Evil Requiem, and this, I think they could all well be. 80 pluses. I really like the look of this game. I think it's going to speak to the Sakiro heads and the hardcore action heads, but it also it's gonna have a little bit more accessibility than you know, the the really hardcore sort of souls like action games. I just have total faith in Capcom and it it just looks great and everyone who's played it has said it just feels great to play.

Samuel
01:32:21
Yeah, I think this feels like a a pretty sensible bet um for all those reasons. I I was really impressed by what I saw of it at Summer Game Fest, so I really uh strongly believe they're on on the right track with this one. And um yeah, it makes sense to me, Matthew. I see your I see your logic there. So Alright, um my next pick is Control Resident. Um people critics fucking love remedy games and control is a game that built up its reputation over time and so I think by the time they released DLC and put it on the um current gen platforms um people just really really loved it. Everyone played the original during COVID. Allen Wake 2 eighty nine on Metacritic, so again feels like a pretty safe bet to me. And I was pretty impressed by what we saw of it at the um the Game Awards, Matthew. So that's uh again feels like a safe pick. I'm pretty certain it'll come out uh next year. What do you think?

Matthew
01:33:11
Remedy a kind of Games journo's favorites, you know? Ef everyone's into those super hardcore uh into that stuff, so Yeah, I I I think this this'll be a really safe pick and I think it will it will happen this year as well crucially. Mm, exactly. So what's your next pick, Matthew? I'm actually gonna double down on Capcom and go for Resident Evil Requiem. Mm-hmm. On the grounds of It is gonna happen. Resident Evil has had a hell of a run. People are really into it. It just has big fans. Like even if it's not quite like Resident Evil 4 good, the arc of of Resident Evil 7 and Village has been generally positive. You know, I can see this comfortably hitting like mid eighties.

Samuel
01:33:57
Yeah, I I think um I agree with that. It's i i it's it doesn't it's not like my most anticipated game of the year, but I think it's just gonna be really dependable as like a a thing to just pick up and enjoy for 15 hours like those last two Resi games have been. Yeah, I think this is a a solid pick. I don't think it'll be like a ninety-five or anything, but I think it will be like an 89 or a 90 in the range. Yeah. Uh which is good enough for the for for the fantasy critic draft as we learned at the end of last year. When most of our games did land in that range, Matthew. Okay, one risk then to CSR. I'm gonna pick the Dusk Bloods on Switch 2. Uh a game I'm not remotely interested in, but um I don't think it's worth betting against Miyazaki. I don't think Nintendo would have shown this and mentioned 2026 unless they were pretty certain it was coming out. And I think we are kind of you know, I know Night Rain came out, but I feel like From is big enough now that we're kind of expecting the next big thing to be around now, since we're up to like four years since Elden Ring came out, I f it feels about right to me that that something from the A team at um at from software would break uh would break cover. So even though I this did kinda look like a bunch of his different games welded together, um I think that a switch to exclusive and his mostly sterling critical um yeah uh reputation will probably help here. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
01:35:20
Yeah, I mean I was reading the interview he did with Nintendo. They did like an Ask the Developer three-parter with him and th the pitch of it sounds good. He's clearly super invested in it. The fact that, you know he himself is working on it. It's you know, it sounds like it's, you know, one of his games full of his ideas, uh, which is usually a pretty good indicator of things. You know, whether or not it's something that speaks directly to me, who knows? I mean it'd be kind of a dreadful move from me to become like a big from guy off the back of their first switch to exclusive. But You know me well enough to know that's something that could very well happen. We simply cannot rule it out of this stage, that's a thing. So um That would have been a good prediction. Yeah, it would have been a good idea.

Samuel
01:36:13
Next year I'm gonna do more predictions that involve you. Because my last one there about Pragmata and 7 out of 10 was great. I think I'm gonna do like Four predictions next year that are about you, Matthew Castle. So that'll be um something for the listeners to look forward to um in 2027. What's your final pick, Matthew?

Matthew
01:36:29
I th I'm pretty sure they've said 2026, so this this one's a gamble. I mean GTA 6 and Fable is already a gamble, but uh I'm gonna take Marvel's Wolverine. Oh yeah, yeah, that'll definitely happen this year. It yeah, it should happen. I'm curious to see what this this game is to me the the bits they've shown off it looks more like a like more like a linear action game than an open world game, but I I don't know if they've shown the the true shape of this game yet, so guessing about it seems seems mad, but Uh Insomniac have just been on such a a a good run with these things. I think their ability to, you know, take these characters and translate their powers into really satisfying, fun combat systems and you know, navigation and movement. I I I you know, I can't seeing it being bad, a bit like with Forza Horizon unless something's gone really, really wrong there. Yeah, I'd be am I'd be amazed if it wasn't like at least an 8 out of 10.

Samuel
01:37:23
We've not talked about that game at all actually on the podcast, um, since they did that big reveal and uh Yeah, it it seemed like it got a bit of a cool response from the people I know, but I really want it to be good. And you know, you talk about pro you talk about productivity in Somiac are really the champions of PS5, like that's gonna be their fourth major release um which is really impressive and uh yeah I think even the bits of Spider-Man uh two I didn't enjoy. That's a a very high quality product and an easy game to recommend to anyone who's bought a PS5. They've taken so long to figure out what Wolverine is. Um, but yeah, you kind of hope it's gonna be good. So yeah, I uh I want it to be good. Um Could land more in that lower eighties range, I think, but um but all all of this is a pointless um exercise based on nothing but whims whatsoever. So that's all right, Matthew. Um okay then to recap I've picked Forza Horizon VI, Saros, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, Control Resident and the Dusk Bloods.

Matthew
01:38:23
What did you pick, Beth? I've picked GTA 6, Fable, Onimusha Way of the Sword, Resident Evil Requiem, and Marvel's Wolverine.

Samuel
01:38:31
Lovely. I was more doing a favor for Graham who runs backpagepod. co. uk there to um save him some admin. But uh either way, hopefully I'll be useful for you to keep track of as listeners. And we'll talk about this again um in the uh alternate game of the year awards at the end of 2026, which feels like a million miles away at this point. So yes.
