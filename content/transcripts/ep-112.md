Hello, welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, I'm starting to say that so fast. I wonder if it's even comprehensible at this point. I should really try and slow down, shouldn't I?
We're back in Games Court. For those new to the show, how would you describe what Games Court is for people?
People who have bought pre-owned games, put them before the judge of Games Court, who in this case is me, Judge Matthew Castle. And I decide if those games were worthy purchases. Please don't come to this episode expecting any great deep analysis of the pre-owned market.
Basically, a lot of it's done on a whim. It's just a bit of fun.
Yeah, basically. I do like the idea of... Because I think that the pre-owned games market is a real thing that rises and falls.
And I see a lot of people talking about how they're pre... They're like doomsday prepping for when the 3DS store closes, basically. And they're like, what should I grab before I barricade myself underground with my family kind of thing?
And I sort of don't understand. But yeah, that's not our storgue.
No, there's definitely a very granular podcast to be made about that, but this isn't that podcast. I just want to be very, very clear about that upfront.
Yep, this is very compromised. This is very silly. This is one of those episodes that I think...
It's real love or hate Games Court, isn't it? It's like, I feel that we get a mix. We either get one of those two responses.
We don't tend to get people who are like, you know what, Games Court's fine. I'm okay with Games Court. People are like, oh, I fucking love Games Court, or those are the ones where I tend to skip the podcast.
And I'm like, I understand. I get it. It's like this podcast strand, unlike some of our others, has a layer of lore to it.
So Games Court's a format we came up with when I, during the pandemic, had bought loads and loads of DS games because there was nothing else to do because you couldn't go to restaurants, et cetera. It was buried in a podcast that, for some reason, has us talking about the idea of those two DS Pokemon games being remade by Nintendo for about 25 minutes. And then it turns into Games Court, really confusing early podcast times for us.
Since then, the lore has grown. I have been the judge a couple of times. Matthew has been the judge.
And in each case, we always put the listeners to death when found guilty of bad taste, basically, or they've paid too much for a game in some kind of novel way. So in the past, this has included Michael Cain drowning people, like in The Prestige, where you get put in a glass box, basically, and it closes, and they drown, and Michael Cain watches you and goes, oh no, that's like a famous one. There's the pulping machine from Hitman 3 where listeners get turned into wine.
That was particularly good. Matthew is really good at coming up with these. I don't even remember what my last one was.
But it was one where you got trapped inside PlayStation Home of mine that I was quite proud of. That was all right. So yes.
First up, Matthew, I was going to basically touch on my Games Court purchases. I've made about like six or seven eligible ones to do a Games Court where I once again go on trial, but I haven't quite got the material yet. But the listeners are absolutely up for it.
We've had upwards of 25 entries or something. Well, two of those didn't have any prices and therefore were ineligible for the Games Court format. They were basically just descriptions of situations that happened once.
Sounds good. We have had lots of good ones. So I think this might be one of our best listener Games Courts yet.
But will it be funny? I mean, it's a Monday night. I mean, that's the part.
Behind the scenes, that's the bit with the most precarious on, isn't it?
Monday night and it's January. Yeah. I've just drunk a glass of incredibly sugary Fentimans Cola to try and jazz myself up.
So, yeah, there's no hope for me. I've got to go to the gym after this. I'm just fucking devastated about that, frankly.
My legs, like I walk like my granddad when he was 60, chasing after me in Sherwood Forest and not really lifting his legs above the ground. That's where my legs are currently at. So, you know, it's tough in here, man.
It's tough in here.
Getting chased around Sherwood Forest makes you sound like some young Robin Hood.
I fantasize about such things. There's like a tree there. They point out and go, that's the tree Robin Hood lived in.
It's like, I very much doubt that he lived in that tree.
He didn't live in a tree?
Well, that's what they told me. My grandpa has told me. I think like maybe they were trying to refer to the Fox version, the Disney version.
But I was like, yeah, surely he just lived in a house with me. It's not like he was in prehistoric times or something. He wouldn't try and live inside a tree.
Very confusing. Anyway, so Games Court. Matthew, can we recap the Games Court law to date so people know where we're at timeline wise?
So I think it's fair to say that most of these have taken place on a fictional North Korean-esque island known as Matthew Castle Island, where time is banned on that island. Do you want to take it from there, Matthew? Is there anything else to know about the law of Games Court at this point?
You've really covered most of the important basics, or at least the ones that I can remember that, yes, time is banned. I'm a dictator. To be honest, I'm not really compiling a wiki of this stuff, but I think that's the really important stuff.
I think so, yeah.
It's an island. There is no time.
Matthew plays a comical judge figure.
You're not allowed to use the internet.
Yeah, that's true, yeah.
Yeah, it's kind of bleak, but, you know, without being too, like, real-world bleak, it's still fun.
Yeah, that's it. But, yeah, none of this has stood in the way of Matthew's relationship with Kim Jong-un, which is, like, they're best buds. They're having a great time, frankly, and I wish them well, so that's good.
So, Matthew, every time we do Games Court, the courtroom is filled with colorful figures to try and set the scene. You know, other people who are there, like, kind of like a fake jury. We sometimes call it a jury, but really, there is no jury, because you just decide if people will die.
No, there's no jury system here. It's like a mad dictatorship, so it makes no sense whatsoever, but anyway. So who have we got in the courtroom?
Well, we've got Yuji Naka is here.
All right.
He saw amnesty on Matthew Castle Island. So, yeah, he's left Japan. He's living here.
Very true to character. When he was standing in the queue to cross the border, he was huffing and puffing the whole time, because he was annoyed at how slow the queue was moving.
Weird. None of this was covered in the Bloomberg article, but yeah.
Yeah, so he's here. That's real world flesh and blood Eugene Hacker. We've got, as always, we've got PS1 Hagrid.
Right, yeah.
The legend. But we're also joined by a PS2 Hagrid. For those tie-in games.
Also a LEGO Hagrid.
Oh, okay. Interesting. A lot of Hagrids here.
All the Hagrids. I thought there might be a next-gen Hagrid, but apparently that cursed Harry Potter game is set in the past, so Hagrid is dead. He's not dead, he's not born.
Hagrid never reached HD. I know he did reach HD, but he didn't reach 4K.
Yeah, so I really wanted 4K Hagrid to be in here, because I think the juxtaposition of PS1 Hagrid and 4K Hagrid would be truly astonishing.
Yep, very good.
We've got running court radio, which is a new thing I'm implementing. I've got DJ Atomica from Burnout.
Right, nice. I really did think it was going to be Yuji Naka and 4 Hagrids and that was going to be it.
Oh no, I've got loads of bullshit.
Okay, great, keep going.
I've got that big baby that chases you around House Beneviento in Resident Evil Village.
Is he going to chase the listeners around the courtroom?
No, he's just going to scream and make general noises. It's quite unpleasant. We may have him pushed out.
I've got Dr. Carol, the floating talking laptop from Perfect Dark.
Okay, great. Good. But you can't access the internet on Dr. Carol.
No, no, definitely not.
Okay, good.
Not a video game character, but I've got that half of Mr. Blobby I saw at that theme park.
It's the other half like a bloke having a cigarette.
Well, that's the half I've got. I've got Mr. Blobby's legs and a man having a cigarette.
Okay, great. Yeah, excellent.
So everyone can enjoy that. I've got the amazing AI alien from Alien Isolation. So that's pretty fun.
But I've also got the really bad AI alien from Alien Colonial Marines.
Yeah, the contrast there. Again, like you've got a variety of Hagrid's and a variety of aliens.
Oh, yeah. It's good to have multiple Hagrid's and multiple aliens. I've got Mario, but he's Mario from Mario Galaxy's level, where he's chased by cosmic clones.
So every five seconds, he spawns another Mario in his wake.
Jesus Christ. That's like that again. We're getting into prestige style territory here.
Yeah, I'm not going to be drowning the Mario clones. And finally, as is tradition, Johnny Sasaki shitting in a barrel.
That's good. I think that was always in my courtroom, so I'm pleased to see him here. That's good.
Oh yeah, he's here. So yeah, whether I'll remember any of those or have absolutely anything to say about any of them, I have no idea. We'll see how it goes.
Yeah, very happy to hear that. That's good. Matthew, just one sec.
I can hear some audio playing in the background. I think it might be my headphones or something. Just going to make sure it's turned on.
Okay, all sorted. I've located the disturbs.
I'd have been worried to have lost that gold.
No, they'll hear the gold, but they'll weirdly hear our last Excel episode in the background.
Well, we have to charge people for it. We've got to give them free Excel access.
We'll send them a bill for £4.50 afterwards. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, so that's who I got.
Okay, great. So, Matthew, there's always, as mentioned, a novel way these defendants get put to death when found guilty. How will they die this time?
For this year's executions, I say years, I don't believe in them, that concept, so that's mad, but in this episode's executions, I'm pulling inspiration from all the ways you could kill the Sims in the original Sims. So we'll be putting them in a swimming pool and then selling the ladder, locking them in a room with a dangerous oven, locking them in a room with a dangerous malfunctioning TV. Basically, lots of locking people in a room with things which will eventually kill them.
Yeah, okay, good. They'll all have to marry each other, then be electrocuted in a swimming pool. It should be good.
Excellent. Right, okay, cool. So I've got...
I should probably point out that I'm the lawyer in this situation. I've been appointed to defend them, a kind of like corrupt Jimmy McGill style figure, but without the charm and without the possibility of redemption. That's me, basically.
So I've prepared an opening speech here just to set the scene. So ladies and gentlemen of the court, welcome back to Matthew Castle Island or whatever sick domain we happen to find ourselves in this time. That was before I was...
I confirmed this was also set on Matthew Castle Island. That noise you hear in the background isn't a radio that someone left on. It's an incarcerated Randy Newman crooning from inside Judge Castle's jungle compound.
Today we're here to put more young men and women on trial for dubious pre-owned purchases. But once again, I ask, how can we question the judgment of a man who built his personal brand on a feud with Yuji Naka, then bought a Sega Mega Drive Mini and Sonic Frontiers in the same 30-day period? Sorry, excuse myself.
I forgot that days are banned here. A period in which Naka himself was arrested. I suspect foul play.
This is a man who's only submitted his CV once in his entire life to WarioWare Inc, which he later learned isn't a real company. This is a man who just two days ago told me he experiences vision quests any time he eats an Il Padrino pizza at Pizza Express. What he knows about justice wouldn't fill Johnny Sasaki's barrel full of shit.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Wow, wonderful. And we were so on the same page with our references.
Yeah, we really were. The WarioWare Inc one was a weird one. I came up with that at lunchtime to start it, wrote it down.
I think that one could do with a third act, that speech. It kind of just sort of peters off, but I hope you enjoyed it.
It was kind of upsetting because Randy Newman just canceled his big European tour due to illness.
Oh no, that's not good. So have I joked about something inappropriate?
No, no, not at all. But no, it was quite funny because I looked at his, there was a tweet, you know, the Randy Newman account, which of course I follow, put this thing out. And someone quoted it, which was like, the number of times this guy's cancelled on me is unreal because he has been cancelling this European tour for about the last five years.
I think it might be that Randy Newman's getting quite old and maybe shouldn't be going around the world. And it's kind of like, protect Randy Newman at all costs, as the youngsters say.
I mean, more plausible is that he's incarcerated in your jungle compound, I think. That's more plausible to me.
I wish. I'd love to have Randy Newman. God, outside my house, playing endless tunes for me from everything except Toy Story would be amazing.
The tweet from the official account says, we one day hope to relocate Randy Newman. Yeah, we want to save him. Yeah, exactly.
They have to send... What was that film with Russell Crowe, the kidnapping expert?
Oh gosh, I'm not sure. Proof of Life. Proof of Life, okay.
Great reference to a two-star northeast film there. Very good. I think that's the film's most famous now for when he had an affair with Meg Ryan on there and it destroyed their marriage.
Anyway, a little cheerful note there to kick off Games Court with. So, these entries. So, a bit behind the scenes here.
So, in past Games Court episodes, me and Matthew have slagged off the listeners for basically submitting an essay and then at the very end of fucking 3,000 words saying, oh, by the way, I bought Fable II for £4.50 and it had a bit of cheeseburg on it. Like, you know, these entries tend to be like, you know, you think, okay, I just want some kind of like games and some prizes and you start reading and it says, the year is 1932, the city is Chicago and then it's just like fucking 18 paragraphs. I'll be honest, there's still a bit of that in this Games Court.
Like, people who, you know, do give us some prizes ultimately but still also want to tell us their life story. How are you feeling about the overall sort of like formats of Games Court entries, Matthew?
Okay, I was worried it might happen. In the last episode, we had an excellent, very long story that had a genuinely very funny punchline about someone finding mounds of shaved pubes inside a copy of Doom 3, which was just such a highlight of this podcast. And I can see the temptation to try and have your own unlikely life story.
You know, it's okay. I don't have a story as good as that and I'll live with it. So, you know, just let the games do the talking.
Yeah, and it's funny though, Matthew, out of these 19 entries, 18 of them end with a pile of pubes falling out of the box. That's shocking, really, isn't it? Okay, good.
Yeah, so some of these are quite long. I'll try my best to read them out clearly so you can understand the full narrative, but they are fucking long. And I have a nine-page Word document here to fire through.
So let's crack on with it. 19 entries in total, only 10 for a win. 10 people kept alive at the end.
Let's see how it goes. Exhibit A. It was the year 2002.
In one of my many trips to the... Literally the joke I just made. I turned to my grandfather and said, no, in one of my many trips to the local video game emporium to see if there's anything I could waste my student loan on, I saw a copy of Final Fantasy VII for PlayStation.
Now, I owned Final Fantasy VII already and had beaten it multiple times, but the last time I played it, one of the cutscenes had been skipping. And so, as I had done for both Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill previously, I bought the game again, so I had a ready replacement for when my original copy went tits up. That is written down.
I would never say that on this podcast, just to be very clear.
It's not that bad. I can think of worse things you could say.
No, but tits up has got a bit of the old LazMag quality. That's it. I feel like I'm out.
So have we.
No, we haven't. It's not like this is fucking loaded or front magazine. This is like, you know, this is 12.
This is 12A.
You've got a man shitting in a barrel.
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Who are we to judge?
Okay, the judge has ruled that tits up is fine. Let's continue. It cost me £12.99 in 2002 money, which adjusting for inflation is around £21 today.
But I got home just in time to make a cup of tea before countdown came on. We don't need this fucking detail. I gaze upon my fresh new copy of FF7 and I got it.
The urge. It was there looking at me. I couldn't resist.
I had to play it. And not the old one. The one that skipped on disc 2.
Good disc that. I had to play the shiny new one, the untouched copy. So I cracked it open and slapped it into my PS2 and the famous, familiar logo appeared.
And the music and, and... Fantasia Final Siete Nuevo Juego Seguir. Those dodgy bastards at Chips had only gone and sold me a Spanish version of the game.
It could happen to anyone, but then I did something. I didn't go back to the shop. I didn't demand a refund.
Instead, I pressed circle to confirm. Well, the little disembodied hand cursor was highlighting what I knew to be the new game option, even if I didn't understand the language. And I began Final Fantasy VII in Spanish.
Hola, mi amo Cloud. I reached come, play the game from memory, not understanding a fucking word any of my amigos were saying before giving up. Cloud never finished his journey, or as the Spanish would say, me de por vencido.
I had to Google that, because as we established, my Spanish is no bueno. That means no good if you don't speak Spanish either. I Googled that too.
I request mercy, or as the Spanish would say, mercy. It's the same word, which is handy. John Cowan McCormick, that's a good entry actually.
Well done, John. So Matthew, that's $12.99 for Final Fantasy VII, which in 2002 I think is still a good price. This has never really been super cheap, FF7, but I think that's alright.
He didn't know it was in Spanish, so I think that's like a victimless crime. If anything, chips should be... What's the punishment again?
How are people dying?
In one of the many ways you could have died in The Sims 1.
Oh yeah, okay, so yeah. Just being electrocuted or something. So yes, I think that's fair enough, Matthew.
We can't put chips on trial. I think John is innocent personally. Thoughts judge.
Brought it and it was in Spanish, that's not his fault. It's a bit of a goof. Did you say how much he spent on it?
Well, like I say, £12.99 in 2002.
And how far did he get in the Spanish version? Did he stick with it?
No, he got to Calm, which is, to be fair, he got out of Midgar. That's about six or seven hours, I reckon. That's pretty good.
I judge everyone against how far I got when I rented it, which was dying on Red 13 and then having to go back to the start.
He got past that.
Yeah, so he managed to beat Red 13, or Rojo Tracer. Very good. Well done.
Thanks, Google Translate. I didn't pronounce that right.
Thanks for making that clip.
I think chips to blame here, but the swimming pool I plan to drown people on in The Sims is very small. It's only three by three tiles, and I don't think I can put the entire workforce of chips in there. Just on the grounds of logistics, I feel like this guy has to go free.
Excellent. Good. We got off on a technicality.
It's what I like to hear. Okay. John, you are free.
Yeah, execution technicality. I just can't fit that many people into any of the tiny rooms. They're all three by three tile rooms.
That is very integral to my murder scheme.
Let's hope none of these listeners are nine people secretly. That would be more than nine people. Okay, good.
Yeah, I did also very much enjoy the Fantasia Final Sietre Icarumba line. That was good.
Could you not just change the language?
I think it might be because the discs were so packed with... Actually, I'm just fucking making it up. I have no idea.
I don't know, actually, because sometimes these PS1 games did have European versions. I don't think it was just so dense with story they couldn't do it.
I'm just used to PAL games having the basic Euro languages in them.
You don't get asked when you start it. That's for sure. I have no memory of that, so yeah, I'm not sure.
Okay. This is a good one, Matthew. Exhibit B.
Hello, boys. Jenny the Donkey here. Last time I emailed in for Games Court.
Matthew ruled that I was allowed to live on the condition that I buy an action replay so I could play my Japanese Capcom games on my UK GameCube. I think it was a beautiful joke if I record. I'm ashamed to admit I never did that because those things are super expensive.
So just assume I'm emailing you from a safe house where it can't be found. But am I turning myself in by emailing back? The lore of these episodes is confusing at best, so I'll let you decide.
E-mail?
A while back. Yeah. Very funny.
Here's some shite I've picked up over the last year. Again, year and infraction there. A sealed copy of Killzone 2, £3.
The orange box on PS3, £12. I picked this up literally just to play its famously unpatched version of Team Fortress 2. Fuck, that's specific, isn't it?
I don't even know what that is. And I host a podcast about computer games. A sealed copy of Metroid Samus Returns, £33.
A sealed copy of WarioWare Gold, £10. A leddies on Wii, £3. Far Cry 2 on PS3, £3.
Really hope you've decided on a new punishment that isn't being ferried away by a sex criminal. What was that one again? I don't remember that.
Try not to think about that. Also, oh right, Dishonored Man.
Oh, that was Dishonored One, that lady thingies party.
Yeah, Lord something or other. Lord Pervert in the basement. Yeah, that one.
Also, as your sole employee, does this interaction count as a performance review? Cheers, Liam Richardson. So, the Jenny the Donkey reference, that's for the Excel heads right there.
But we don't want to keep overselling the patrons people. Lest our listeners resent us. So, Matthew, what do you think of that list?
There's a lot there to unpack. I wouldn't say there's anything too spicy, dangerous or spicy interesting in there. Like, pretty standard fare.
The one that jumps out is Elodie's. Or Elobits, I thought it was called over here. Or maybe it was the other way around.
Because that is, that's like the weird Konami launch game for Wii. This is when Konami was destroying loads and loads of games at the Wii in the first couple of years. It's like a, almost like a sort of first person, it's not like gun shooter per se, but it's like a sort of physics shooter where you sort of pick up objects and fling them around a house to try and collect these little electronic sprites.
I guess there's like a little bit of Katamari in it in terms of like the chaos and like the domestic objects and the thrill of just causing a big old mess. That's an interesting one. Only lives on Wii.
Doesn't, you know, doesn't exist anywhere else, so.
£3 is pretty innocent as well, I think.
Yeah, £3 is pretty interesting. Yeah, I would have thought that would actually be more just on the grounds of it being quite rare and, and like I say, exclusive and unusual, but maybe we haven't quite got there with Wii. You know, Orange Box, Far Cry, Killzone 2, none of those kind of excite me too much.
All of those would seem, I think, a bit more like, oh, I get it, if they're on Xbox, but because they're all on PS3, it's kind of strange.
Yeah, that is weird.
Obviously not Killzone, but yeah.
That is sinister. It's not quite right.
Well, maybe it's because he just doesn't have an Xbox. That's probably the most likely explanation, you know.
Yeah, yeah, then that's less sinister.
The 3DS price has all seemed right to me. Metroid Samus Returns has obviously kept its value. WarioWare, I think they just had fucking tons of copies of it, and they would just, you know, burn it through the stock.
I got it for about a price.
There's nothing that gets me too, like, hot under the collar about this collection. Do I want to, like, drown loyal Liam Richardson in a tiny, tiny swimming pool? Yeah.
Probably not. I feel like we're going to see some worse entries than this. So, yeah, I'm going to let them go.
I'm feeling lenient.
Congratulations, Liam. I hope you enjoy your copy of Killzone 2. A brown but good shooter, in my opinion.
Yeah. I mean, also imagine trying to find another good podcast editor to do the XL and XXL. It's just too much work, isn't it?
It only really works because Liam's kind of a member of our cult, really. You know what I mean? Like, we've just sort of got some kind of weird hold over him and someday they'll make a true crime documentary about it.
But that's on the cards, I think.
We don't refer to him as Jenny the Donkey behind the scenes for any listeners curious about that. It's not like, listen, Donkey, edit this podcast. Because that's got quite unpleasant vibes.
Yeah, I just think he's beautiful, I want to take him to the pub, and one day he'll choke to death on a Wii peripheral. That's the whole journey there. Okay, Exhibit C.
Dear Samuel and Matthew, Just finished a very enjoyable vegetables prediction episode. Now tingly with excitement for the delicious pudding in 11 months time. That's a reference to Matthew calling our 2023 predictions episode worthless, but the one that will follow later on will be fun, which is kind of accurate, but I think I was a pretty solid pod.
Maybe a little late to make the cut, but I had been intending to send in a Games Court submission. Let me be direct with Judge Castle. I've never played the game.
I bought on eBay in the early 2010s. I hope Your Honor will show me some leniency. Now this entry is fucking long, but it's one we just had to have on this episode.
The game is Zelda, The Wand of Gamelon for the Philips CD-i. My eBay history doesn't have detail of over 10 years ago, but I remember it was around £85. As I've never played it, I have no idea who or what a Gamelon is.
For those who are unaware, there was an obscure trilogy of Zelda games on the ill-plated Philips console. I had a CD-i growing up as I had a dad who worked in the local Philips factory. To this day, I have no idea whether he procured it or just took it home from his workplace.
One of the games that came with it in the early 1990s was Link the Faces of Evil. This was my first Zelda game before I got into the good stuff with Link's Awakening the following year. Even as a child with limited understanding of what constituted a good game, I remember the overwhelming feeling that The Faces of Evil was utter dogshit.
I urge everyone to look at a long play video on YouTube to appreciate quite how bad it was. There is voice acting for Link in the cutscenes that is so awful, it must have played a part in Nintendo keeping him mute for the last 30 years. The gameplay itself was horrendous, being a 2D side-scroller rather than top-down.
I'm not sure it is possible for a game to run at less than one frame per second, but this banished it. Over the next decade, I became a huge Zelda head and devoured all the mainline games. Trying to be a completionist, I ventured onto eBay to finish the other two parts of the CD-i trilogy.
£85 for the Ones of Gamelon was the going rate at the time and I was happy to pay to be one step closer to a complete collection. I still bear, however, as the third game Zelda's Adventure was going for over £500 and I had come to my senses by then. To this day, the Ones of Gamelon box is somewhere in my loft, having never truly made it out of the padded envelope it was delivered in.
I had sold the CD-i console on eBay a couple of years prior, so there was never any prospect of it being played. I hope Judge Castle looks favourably upon me with the noble intention I had to build a fully complete collection of Zelda games. Cuts from CaptainBirdsEye, who's CaptainBirdsEye in Discord basically.
There's a bit more there Matthew, but I think that's enough reading from me for now. Thoughts on this one?
I mean, this really is a piece of shit. I have, I can't remember which, I played one of them when I was on NGamer, because we did a history lesson on it, and it was just, it was such an abomination. Just really charmless, felt like, you know, someone had like, misheard what Zelda was about.
There was so little like, Zelda DNA in it, and there was so little like, love for it, no, love for the world. This sort of like, I always remember it as this sort of like, slightly dragons lair looking thing. It's really grim, and the voice is terrible.
I must admit, some of this game blurs in with the Zelda cartoon from the time, with the, excuse me, princess, and I always thought it was the game and not the cartoon, so, you know, it doesn't really matter because they're both shit. So like, confusing them is fine. I don't really agree with building a whole Zelda project.
Like, I actually think it sort of disrespects proper Zelda to include this in that collection. It's just too shit. And you've got rid of the machine that could play it.
The one reason you might have it. There is literally no reason to have this. That makes no sense.
Yeah, I think it sucks. It's just like tiresome Zelda memes come from it. No, bad vibes, bad purchase.
You're going in the pool. But you can go enter the pool via the ladder. And then I'll remove the ladder.
OK, very good. OK, so Captain Birds Eye is dead. That's 2-1 to me.
I should point out, it takes quite a while for Sims to die. So he's going to be splashing around in there for a while.
OK, girl, bleak. Wow, OK. Actually, I wasn't going to read out the PS, but I think it is worth reading out, Matthew, having scanned it while you were delivering judgment.
When I sold the CD-i console, it was collected in person by a couple of a similar age to me at the time. I had a nice 20-minute chat with them both as they talked me through their love for retro gaming and other curios. A few weeks later, I received an eBay message from the girl letting me know that she had separated from her boyfriend and asked if I wanted to go to her house to see it in action with a winking emoji.
I never replied, but have often wondered whether I'm unique in being the only person in the world to have been propositioned over a Philips CD-i. Okay, I'm so glad I read that out. That's really good.
I almost feel bad about drowning this person now or setting them on the path to drowning.
Well, you should have told the story first. You know what I mean? If you put it in the PS, what am I to do?
By then, justice has already been delivered, Captain Bird.
Justice has been served, question mark.
Exhibit D. Hello, Honorable Gents. I've been thinking about all my gaming purchases over the years.
It seems I'm buying fewer and fewer games in my adult life, and so it's tricky to find anything to be judged on. Until I remembered my school trip to France when I was around 12 years old. Is there a time in which these crimes sort of lapse, Matthew?
Historical crimes?
No, there's no statute of limitations on Castle Island, because there's no time. You were as guilty as the day you did the crime. You were not guilty as the day you did the crime.
Day.
The year is 1853. I just bought a copy of Ludo for £12.50. There was a part on the trip where we were able to walk freely around a French town for a few hours.
I headed to the nearest game shop and picked up Dino Crisis. I'd been so eager to get it. Cue nervous sweating from me as not only was I underage, Dino Crisis was a 15 in the UK, but I would probably not understand the shop assistant if he challenged anything with the purchase.
I needn't have worried. It turned out French really don't worry about that as much as the Brits. He took my money and gave me my game.
Probably spent around 250 francs, which equals to around £35, if my research is correct. Whatever it was, it was nearly all my spending money had been given for the trip. I had just enough to get my parents a shitty magnet as a souvenir for the ferry ride home.
Very familiar, kind of like a sort of socio-economic bracket as me, a sort of French trip there. When I got home, I was super excited to play the game I'd been waiting ages for. I wanted to put it in my PlayStation to discover, of course, all the texts in a language I could barely understand.
This is, of course, all in the age of pre-internet guides. No translators are readily available. At one point, I got a mag with a walkthrough for the game, but that made little difference.
I do believe I completed the game years later, only after buying it again, second hand in the UK. Please don't judge too harshly. I was naive and reckless in my childhood, but I've certainly changed my ways.
I also still own the French copy I bought all those years ago. That's on Betamax Bandit on Discord, who seems like a cool person. Thoughts on this one, Matthew?
Another international purchase of a game that backfired.
Yes, yes. Interesting theme that's emerging. I mean, the tricky thing about Dino Crisis, and that's coming from the perspective of me who wants to kill loads of people, is that it is, you know, famously got Shootakumi involvement.
This is like what he kind of cut his teeth on pre Ace Attorney. He was sort of I think he's known as the director of the first half of this game, and then the director of the whole of Dino Crisis 2. And as a big Takumi head, I feel like that's kind of like a sort of spell of protection cast over it, even in French.
Yeah, it's a tricky one, this Dino Crisis. Dino Crisis sort of passed me by at the time. You know, it wasn't one that like, you know, in a time when you didn't have like vast amounts of money to just buy endless games, you know, this was like a little lower down the list of priorities.
Like I never had a friend who had Dino Crisis.
I did. I had a friend who had it. It was, it did to me just seem very, very similar to Resi, but with dinosaurs.
Like it was, I don't know if there was loads more to it than that, but that's what it seemed like to me from watching someone play through it.
I mean, that is the pitch. So they succeeded.
Yeah, yeah. It's, you know, fun. Fun, you know, dinosaurs, you know, dinosaurs that were still novel to see them in games at that point for sure, you know.
Yeah, but good enough to just buy on a French ship and spend all your money. I mean, now I'm just trying to think what else could you have spent your money on? You could have bought, you know, a lot of fireworks, maybe.
That's classic school trip purchase. It's Dino Crisis better than fireworks. Yeah, probably.
I'm not getting many executions today.
Well, I think you've been too kind, to be honest. Yeah, you could punish this one because she could have turned the box around. I serve justice, not my clients.
Also, I'm getting paid on a quota here of like, you know, if I can get a few deaths in there, someone will give me a backhander behind the courtroom. So, you know, I've got to do what I can. I think that, like, with PlayStation Box, it's really easily signaled when it is like the language in question because you just turn it over and it has the little flags there.
So I think she could have looked this up, Matthew. I don't know if that changes your mind at all.
Oh, that is interesting. That's cast this in a whole new light.
The information was there, you know what I mean?
The information was there. I mean, like, let's not beat around the bush here. The thing Shootakumi is famous for is what he did after Dino Crisis.
So, like, it's not like I'm upsetting the great man if we do chuck this in.
I mean, arguably, there is no narrative of Dino Crisis and Shootakumi that exists outside of your head. Like, I'm not sure that anyone else in the world thinks about that connection. I'm pleased you do, but, you know, I'm just saying, you know.
You know what? You've convinced me. Yeah, I'm putting them in a 3x3 tiled room with a fireplace, which will, in time, set fire to the couch and then later her.
Okay, cool. All right, we'll check back in three hours. See how that's going.
Good.
Update, they have drowned in the swimming pool.
Okay, great. Well, congratulations. The courtroom, the Hagrid's are all burst into applause.
Yeah, but I'm going to use one of those nets that you use to clean the leaves out to scoop up the copy of CDI Gamelon to sell online myself for some profit.
Online? But there's no internet here, Matthew.
Oh, well, yes, you're right.
To give to a man on horseback who will sell it for you in another country.
Well, maybe I have a secret, the only computer, but I don't want people to know that, obviously.
Okay, very good. Just a very bad Windows 95 PC with a 56K modem. Yeah.
Okay, this is good because this is mostly prices and not a life story, which I do appreciate. So, Exhibit E, Hello Normal Men. We're getting a lot of that, Matthew, because of the old, we're just normal men meme that did the rounds.
Oh, right.
Remember that? It was good. Pretty funny, wasn't it?
The little puppet man. Anyway, in 2018, I was in a shop in Dublin that used to be HMV. For about a month, they had a clearance section of games that no one seemed to touch.
Clearly, all of the games were from some warehouse of old HMV stock that liquidators were trying to get some money for. At first, the games were available at the bargain price of 5 for 10 euros, but a week later, this got slashed to 10 for 10 euros. The games for sale are mostly atrocious, and I had at least five copies of each game.
I thought that buying 10 of the worst games I could find would be a funny gag gift for a friend. The games were... This is really interesting.
So these are one euro apiece?
Yes, exactly. That is cheap. But there's some damage along the way here, as you'll see.
FIFA 15 on the Xbox One. Call of Duty Ghosts on the PS3. Beach Volleyball Summer Heat on the PS2.
Pop Idol, the official video game on the PS2.
Family Fortunes on the PS2. 24 the game on the PS2. Real Heroes Firefighter on the Wii.
I assume NGamer gave that 86 or something, Matthew. Jasper Carrott's Golden Balls on the Wii.
Oh, fucking curse. That's like a ten percenter.
Jasper Carrott's Golden Balls on the DS.
Double Golden Balls.
And the last one, Russell Grant's Astrology on the DS. Now, I think you could argue that 24 the game and Call of Duty Ghosts are like, alright. There is more to this entry, as you'll just read out, but I decided to keep FIFA and COD Ghosts myself because I'm a bad friend, and in the end I got decent use out of FIFA.
Shamefully, I forgot to give my friend the other eight games for years, until earlier today when I presented each game to him individually, like in a NAD War interview. I don't know what that reference is. We got some good laughs out of it, especially from the awful 3D models, the family fortunes Vernon Kay and Golden Balls Jasper Carrott.
I know that there's a very slim chance that they'll ever actually play these games, and I know how this pod feels about games never getting played, but spending a tenner to make a friend laugh is worth it for me every time. Please don't kill me, love, Mr Q. Wow, Matthew, what do you think?
I mean, I'll tell you what, weirdly, what's swung it into the death zone for me is that it's specifically Vernon Kay era family fortunes. It's not even iconic, let's say.
Let's do this, yeah. That's really funny.
Double Jasper Carrott, Golden Ball. Oh, that's terrible. Oh, I hated Golden Balls.
Jasper Carrott, he's such a bad pick for it, trying to act all sincere and serious. I can see the box for that now. That is just so cursed.
It's a funny gift. It's a funny, like, you know, punking someone gift, but that isn't really what we're evaluating here.
No, we have to safeguard quality in this Games Court format. That's what we're here for, right?
Yeah. Oh, this is going straight in the pool.
It was a fun entry, though. Thank you very much for setting it in. That was really fun.
There was a picture as well of all of these games.
Oh, right. So it's actually...
Yeah, that's not made up.
This actually happened. That's almost too good to be true. The Russell Grant astrology, I can remember that, because the box of that is just Russell Grant's big face gurning away in the middle.
What you've described there is one month's reviews roundup in NGamer. All of those games would go on that spread. And they'd all get about 23%.
So, yeah, just really ranked stuff. Well done.
Respectfully as well. I'm sure Jasper Carrott has made things that are good to people who have some knowledge of the history of British TV that I don't. But if you asked me, what do you know about Jasper Carrott?
I would say I know he's the father of that actress who was in The Office and Wonder Woman and Golden Balls. And that's all I know about him, so that's tough. Okay.
I should note that half of Mr Blobby has picked up at the mention of Jasper Carrott, just because it's kind of like his era of entertainment.
Very much, yeah, tuning in there. So I'm 3-2 down, actually, so I'm losing here, which is not good. I've never lost in Games Court, so yeah.
I mean, you did talk me into one of those.
Yeah, you know, I just thought you made for better podcasting.
Oh yeah, you want some drama.
Okay, next up. Hello, large gentleman. I'm not sure if I can enter twice.
Oh, he submitted two Games Court entries there. Sorry, mate, but it was just too many. I was confused by doing two at once, so we just did this one.
I recently bought a box PS2 collection off eBay, £58, that I broke apart and sold to CX slash auction using the profit, £45 cash and £120 CX credit. I picked up some games and an Xbox 360 system, as I've never owned one. An Xbox 360 Elite plus three pads boxed at £45, including postage, bought via an eBay auction.
That's pretty good. CX purchases, then there's a long list here. Harry Potter, the Chamber of Secrets for the original Xbox.
PS2 era Hagrid likes it.
Unit price £6. Prisoner of Azkaban on the original Xbox, £4. Both these games can be played on the 360, he points out.
Binary Domain, Xbox 360, £3. Infinite Undiscovery, Xbox 360, £3. That's kind of like a slightly whiffy JRPG, if I recall.
I think I reviewed that.
Maybe Fetish.
It was just a whole lot of nothing.
Star Ocean Last Hope, which I reviewed and I hated. That was £2.50 on 360.
It's got a legendarily bad hero name. I can't remember what it is.
Edge Maverick, I think.
Edge Maverick.
Yeah, I believe it is. That was a tough hang. He's a tough hang, old Edge Maverick.
Ninja Blade, brackets, looks like a From Software riff on Devil May Cry, £3.60, £2. Eternal Sonata, Xbox 360, £4. Xenoblade 2, Nintendo Switch, £42, bloody hell.
Quite a mix here.
Isn't that just what the price of Xenoblade 2 is?
Yeah, basically. If you bought that second hand, I don't know what you're thinking, really, just buy a new copy. Some people may question why someone would purchase an Xbox 360 to play a load of old Harry Potter games and JRPGs, but I have enormous affection for the first three Harry Potter games released on the GameCube and PS2.
I should also point out this is before we knew JK. Rowling's views on gender. Bear that in mind, I guess.
As the OG Xbox was generally one of the best places to play multiplayer, multi-platform games, I thought this might be a great way to revisit them. While some of the above games are available on PS3, most of them are between three to four times more expensive. Eternal Sonata is £15 for a slightly better version, so the 360 offered better value.
I will go to back here for Ninja Blade, Matthew, which is kind of like a sort of a rip-off of Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry at the same time, which I did play and is perfectly enjoyable, quite throwaway. Eternal Sonata is one of the better 360 JRPGs of all I recall. I think it's made by the Bandai Namco, like the Tales people.
I owned this game, and it's like a real wet blanket JRPG. It's like this soft cutesy thing. Oh, I wasn't a fan.
It looks really nice though.
Doesn't it play out in the dying dream of...
Chopin.
Yeah.
It's quite interesting for a setting. I thought it looked really nice, cell-shaded art style. But is that a no from you, dog?
Got binary domain in there. This is just like horrible flashbacks to some terrible freelance I did. This was proper, like, who takes on infinite undiscovery for a half page review?
And listen, that isn't the defendant's fault. That's entirely on me. But, you know, Dems the Breaks.
Yeah, bad selection of things. And Harry Potter games. These were bad.
But I think people who played them in their first game or one of their earlier games have an affection for them.
I think Azkaban is the one that has a slight open world element to it where you can sort of fly around the school. I think that's the one they did that in. I don't think it was much more acclaimed than the other ones.
I sort of get it, but I don't know. I do find the whole millennial Harry Potter thing really embarrassing, so I would never really go on about how much I used to enjoy Harry Potter because I sort of want to shake it off and get on my life. I sort of get the appeal somewhat, but the only Harry Potter games from this era that I really liked were the Game Boy Color JRPG riffs.
They were legit, I thought. So I don't know. I don't know if these, despite the sort of emotional connection here, Matthew, I'm not so sure.
Again, doing bad lawyering.
This is the thing. They're buying the Harry Potter based on a positive emotional connection. I'm thinking of judging the JRPGs based on my personal negative reaction, which it all comes down to Ninja Blade, doesn't it?
Right in the middle. I think people tried to sell this as one of those seven out of tens, but I don't think it necessarily is quite that good.
I think it's one of those six out of tens, to be honest.
I think it might be one of those five out of tens.
It's alright. It's perfectly playable. I did play it at the time.
It's just like...
Yeah, very wild quick time events.
That's why I remember.
Almost like Platinum Lite.
I do also love the effort to throw from software in there to give it a bit of cred retroactively. But this is pre-Dark Souls from software.
Does he get past just on the strength of the curiosity factor of Ninja Blade?
And Bino Domain being good, of course, and £3 is a good price.
Oh, yeah, I completely forgot about Bino Domain. That swings it. Xenoblade is a lot of money, though.
In terms of just pure classic, like was this a wise pre-owned purchase? £42 on Xenoblade 2 feels quite dumb to me.
Right, yeah.
Like careless, because it's such a large amount of money for something you can just buy new for pretty much the same amount of money. Also, it had gloating about reselling profit, which I never like in these entries.
New rules being thrown in at the last minute.
Well, you know, there was the guy who was buying all the Silent Hill games to basically, like, put a kid for university or something.
I don't think that was part of it, but, you know, it was certainly silly. That was a fun entry, though. It was good to...
Yeah. Yeah. I like the idea of these things being bought and then growing dusty in some cupboard somewhere, as it should be done.
Grow a pair of balls, Judge Castle. Just fucking kill the guy. Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, it's a death. It's the 3x3 room with the faulty television and the dishwasher that leaks, so it's electrocution, eventually.
I love that you have to come up with a different one for every single one of these.
Well, no, I'm circling them, because the other two rooms are occupied.
It's like dialogue in an open world game. Eventually you'll hear it all, and it'll circle back.
Yeah, and then I'll go, we'll be looping back round to the burning gout room scene. And actually, I'm a bit of a hypocrite, because I just said I don't like people gloating about reselling, but I am going to sell their Sims gravestones for a tiny bit of money.
Okay, good. I certainly enjoyed that. I'm 4-2 down now.
Can I turn it around? We've got some good ones coming up here. They're actually quite short, thank fuck, because Jesus Christ.
Okay, Exhibit G. Bought some 360 games in the New Year. Some licensed, but none are available on digital stores or backwards compatible.
Prices are converted from euros to pound and rounded up. Adventures of Tintin, 6 pounds. Peter Jackson's King Kong, the official game of the movie, 9 pounds.
James Cameron's Avatar, the game, 5 pounds. The Godfather, 18 pounds. Wolfenstein 2009, 13 pounds.
I played a fair bit of Tintin and Avatar. They've only got 6s in the old 7 at the time, but pretty much 5s in 2023. They look nice for the time, even if that Tintin movie is cursed.
Yeah, I suppose it is very realistic. One last one here, Tetris DS, 21 pounds. I'm not sure why this game is more expensive than I expected, but I played a lot of Tetris DX and wanted it for my collection.
I fucking love Tetris DS, Matthew. That's like the best version of Tetris in my opinion. Apart from maybe the Tetris effect.
Well, it's just like it's got so many great riffs on Tetris, like Battle Tetris and the touch screen DS one, where you have to move the blocks to slide and perfectly solve a puzzle on one screen. Really, really good. You've got all the quite fine use of Nintendo characters as well.
I can see why this would retain its value as a DS game and highly collectible. But what do you think of all that, Matthew, which is mostly licensed games?
Yeah, it's quite an interesting little film collection there. I was just thinking, is there a through line of like, these are adaptations of directors at their worst? But then I was like, well, Godfather, that's preposterous.
Like, that's Francis Ford Coppola at his best. And I quite like King Kong film.
Fucking long that film, though.
Tin Tin, though. Bad Spielberg and Avatar. Who likes Avatar apart from spending $2 billion on it?
I do want to play that Ubisoft game that's coming out, though. Like, I imagine that would look pretty as hell, so...
Yeah, yeah. They're kind of interesting. I think the Tin Tin game was, like, not good, but wasn't, like, totally bust.
It wasn't like a side-on, sort of, almost like Prince of Persia-looking platformer thing. It certainly was on the Wii. I don't know whether that's the same on 360.
And had it was, like, quite quirky and, like, reasonably well-received.
King Kong's pretty interesting as well.
Yeah, I mean, that's... Yeah, that's, like, one of the early, interesting 360 games. Yeah, like, interesting stuff it does with, you know, kind of strip-back HUD and all that stuff.
It felt quite, sort of, immersive.
Avatar, I played at the time, and only at a preview event, but you could play as the humans or the Navi, which is quite interesting. It looked like... it was like knock-off Far Cry, basically.
Not as good Far Cry, in my memory. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I think there's too many interesting things in here. I think you're right about Tetris DS.
It's just too novel a thing to chuck in a swimming pool and then have to fish out in about half an hour. So, yeah, you may walk free. Go and enjoy your mixed selection of filmic treats.
Very good. Okay, cool. We're 4-3.
I'm just going to go look in the living room, see how Beatamax Bandit's doing. Oh, no, she's just sat there on the chair and she's still alive. What's waiting for it to set fire?
Oh, it's not a fire.
We'll circle back on that. Exhibit H. What's your honor's ruling on scalpers?
As it's late at night on the weekend and I'm weak, I just paid £89 for an N64 switch controller for F0ZX. Sorry, F0X. RRP, £40, but permanently out of stock with Nintendo.
This rarest hen's teeth item did briefly get restocked and I joined the expensive switch online tier in a stressful hurry to even be able to order one. And then I had a long ongoing nightmare with a courier who didn't deliver a Nintendo customer service, rudely giving me the runaround. One of those times where you're a grown man who really wants a stupid plastic toy and the bad people are making you want to cry by not giving it to you.
I was impotently furious for weeks about how things went down. Anyway, I figured that if I was just bothered by it, I must really want one. Now I've realized I can just give money to eBay profiteers and wake up to N64 games on Christmas morning, but I didn't feel good doing it.
That's some grey mess. £89, Matthew, for an item that costs £40, but is a very enticing prospect to a certain generation of player. I can see why this happened.
Thoughts, Judge Castle?
Yeah, before we get into the pad, I should say that on Castle Island, hen do have teeth, so that doesn't really add up. We genetically modified them. It was a terrible decision.
It really freaks me out to this day.
They have too many teeth. They're constantly falling out.
Well, that's it. That is the problem. We hit just the right number of teeth, and now it's really awful.
I kind of like the extreme tunnel vision of buying a very expensive thing for this one specific purpose of playing F-Zero X specifically. That's quite winning. And it's also frustrating that Nintendo don't produce enough of these things.
There's a big kind of artificial bumping up of the price of these things. It's just too mad not to kind of appreciate, I think. And F-Zero X is just, oh, what a game.
To be able to play that properly, I'm quietly envious of that.
Yeah, you also just can't buy this still. I just look on Nintendo Store and they're just out of stock still. And it's like, well, so yeah, I kind of appreciate how this happens.
So, good, good, I agree with your verdict there. 4-4, Matthew.
Oh, better pick it up.
What do you mean, like, just kill people randomly? That's good. Exhibit I, I was recently struck by wave nostalgia for the Dreamcast.
Wait, can you smell that? Oh, I think it might be, someone's gone up in flames.
Oh, okay, Beat'em X Bandit, sorry about that. Yeah, rough in there, man. That's tough.
But at least you can sell the gravestone for a pittance.
Yes, unfortunately, it's also burning the copy of Dino Crisis, so it's that kind of burnt plastic smell.
We'll also congratulate our listeners who stopped saying fucking princely sum in every one of these emails. It was driving me nuts for a while there.
Honestly, these guys, they need a production editor.
I was recently struck by a wave of nostalgia for the Dreamcast. A console I had hastily abandoned in about 2002. I sold my consoles and console all my games for a derisory £50 to a friend who had driven a hard bargain.
I bitterly recall handing it all over in a bin bag in our dark and rarely used school library. A fitting setting for such an ill-advised exchange. Given the state of the retro games market, reassembling the Dreamcast collection of my teams was going to cost me a pretty penny.
Exploring eBay, I found an auction that looked underpriced. Upon closer inspection, that was likely because it was collection only, because the condition of the items was variable, to say the least. But in the heat of the moment, I dismissed this.
So excited was I to put in my hands a controller that flies directly in the face of the common sense. Of common sense and ergonomics. For the sum of £133.09, I'd won the following.
Two Dreamcast consoles, one beautifully white but broken console, and one working but incredibly yellowed console. Six official controllers, four functioning, two broken.
Terrible.
I guess it just wants it out of the house. Three VMUs, Virtual Memory Units, two official, one Mad Cat's branded one. Games, Sega Bass Fishing, MDK2, Power Stone 2, Resident Evil 2, brackets missing a disc, Resident Evil Code Veronica, Toy Racer, House of the Dead 2, Floyd and Bros.
Episode 1.
Sonic Adventure disc only, Shenmue 2 missing the slip cover, much to my chagrin, Giant Killers, and then there's a bunch of empty cases here for Choo Choo Rocket, Quake 3, Shenmue and Power Stone, the original, NB, the listing said, collection from Reading, a direct train from London, so no major issue, but upon contacting the seller, he informed me it was in fact Tilehurst, which required me to change trains at Reading, and adding about 40 bins to my journey when you factor in waiting times. This journey incurred an additional cost of around £20 to train tickets and Oyster Card Charges, which I feel duty bound to add to the purchase total, putting it closer to £150 total. That's some koi, fuck, that took ages to read.
Did they also end up dating the person they purchased the train from?
Any more matchups? So yeah, koi. So a bit of Dreamcast nostalgia there.
Some quite good games in there. Missing the slip cover for Shenmue 2, but still having the game is pretty great, I would say. And Cody got Code Veronica in there, Sonic Adventure.
These are some classics, Matthew. I think that's okay for a bit of nostalgia. The selling in the first place, that's not really what we're putting on trial here.
It's the purchases.
Thoughts, Judge?
Yeah, I mean, the whole, like, buying a load of broken and empty shit is kind of cursed.
Yeah, definitely, yeah.
The opening to that letter had, like, big 12 days of Christmas energy, with the kind of three VMUs, two busted controllers, and a copy of Shenmue 2 without its slipcase. As proven on our episode with Andy Kelly, I'm not like Mr Dreamcast, so, you know, to me this sounds like, yeah, great. I probably would have, you know, I'd probably be happy with the same thing.
I guess you can't really mark it down for, like, buying a load of excess broken shit. That's not your fault.
having looked at what Flaugen Bros is, I think you can mark it down for that a little bit, but... That sounds like a made-up game, doesn't it? That's like something that would appear in, like, Rick and Morty or something.
Flaugen Bros?
I don't even want to know what it is.
Got a 3 out of 10 from Edge. That's what it got.
Oh, owch. Did you say the last four of those were just empty boxes, though?
Yeah, Choo Choo Rocket, Quake III, Shenmue and Power Stone.
I mean, it would be so much stronger if those boxes weren't empty.
Yeah, it would be. Actually, have I got that right, actually? Yeah, those are the empty cases.
I don't know, man. This just feels like you got a bin bag and happened to get a couple of, like, decent things in it, rather than, like, you bought a load of cool stuff and there were a few flaws. It's such a lucky dip.
I feel like it has to go in the swimming pool.
Okay, fair enough. There we go. It's a 4-5 to the judge.
That's good. It's just, like, it's consistency that did you in there. Yeah, just, like...
Like, it's just, like...
You could have left the empty cases out and, like, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I don't like the honesty of it, but it's like, I got six pads, but two of them were broken. You're like, the hassle of having to throw away all that broken shit, or just test it out, like, I don't know. It's not for me.
Yeah, getting a DM from the seller saying, oh, come round and I'll show you some more of my empty boxes, if you know what I mean.
Exhibit J. Two tales here. Firstly, a Facebook purchase of 36 old NGamer slash O&M mags from the Wii U 3DS era.
I believe some key text from The Castle Arc, 2009 to 2012. For the princely sum.
There it is. That's an NGamer reader, alright. Churning out that cliched box.
Princely sum of £20. God, I've just died inside. Secondly, perhaps the most dubious series of purchases has been my semi-midlife crisis desire to rebuild my old GameCube collection.
This came about following an evening where myself and some old friends decided to play Melee in Double Dash, and it rekindled my nostalgia for that weird purple box. Very formative for my early gaming years. I decided then there that I needed one back in my life again.
So here is the damage so far.
I really hope this isn't just a list of the ten obvious best GameCube games. That's what I'm saying in advance.
No, it's actually like... No, it's all over the place, this, really.
Okay, well, as long as it's like... There's a couple of things that are so good that you are like instant pass if you've got them. I'm not going to say what they are, but if I hear one of them, I'll be...
let's see.
I think they'll be alright, let's see. Baton Kytos, £51. Catherine Castle, classic there.
Super Mario Sunshine, £11. Super Smash Bros. Belly, £26.50.
Tony Hawk's Underground, £5.75. Need for Speed Underground, £3.25.
Any more Undergrounds?
That's all the Undergrounds. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, £4. Now how can you argue with that, Matthew?
And the fourth game as well for £4.
Oh, that's the one I played and loved on GameCube.
Okay, nice. Wind Waker, £20. That's a good price for Wind Waker.
Skies of Arcadia, £90. Extreme G3, FF Crystal Chronicles and Super Monkey Ball 2, £18 for the lot. And that's the whole list from Tofu Jacob.
That seems like a pretty good list to me overall, Matthew. No empty boxes, you know?
No empty boxes, that's a plus. It's expensive, but Skies of Arcadia, it's like a bit of a... I had a copy and sold it years ago on GameCube, and it's like my big, my one major pre-owned or trading regret.
So, you know, would I pay £90 to get that game back? You just can't play it anywhere else, can you really?
No, they've never put it on any other format. And like, surely this is low down the list for Sega, a company that owns Atlus, you know what I mean?
Yeah, but it's so beloved.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah, I think that's like, there's some obvious things in there. I'm like, yeah, right. But that's, yeah, that's interesting.
I like that. The Tony Hawk, that's, you know, great games, three and four. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
These look like alright prices to me as someone who's like paid attention to this market in recent years. I mean, I thought actually the big games court entry, I've got to put through you at some point, Matthew, is my £90 purchase of Thousand Year Door on GameCube. Why did I do that?
What was I thinking? What was I thinking? Did I like, was I going through some stuff?
I don't remember now. That was before like the energy price fucking crisis happened. I should make that clear.
Okay.
Oh yeah, I haven't factored that in. The next one we do should be like any energy crisis special.
That's a fun theme for a video games podcast, isn't it? Just remind you of why all of your frivolous purchases are actually bad for you. Okay, good.
So is he off this guy? Is he good?
Yeah, he's fine.
Okay, cool. We're back up to five, five. Nice.
This is quite a funny one. Exhibit K. Because making things weird in one's first post is always a good idea, I dreamt this morning I encountered Samuel and Matthew in a grocery store parking lot in Bath.
Brackets they shopped together naturally, and I found out I am one inch shorter than either of them. They truly are giant men. But the most important matter was to regale them of my real life search outside the UK for a certain choice beverage.
It took me three braid style attempts to inform them in the least verbose manner possible. I haven't even found Rio Tropical in a beverage store named Rio. This clearly means the time has come to submit my entire used games library for judgement.
Okay, lots to unpack there. Me and Matthew actually encountered a listener in the wild the other day, which is, this reminded me of that. That was very nice, wasn't it?
Hello to that listener if you're listening out there. That was a very pleasant encounter, wasn't it Matthew?
Yeah, he's like, I'm not really into the Games Court episodes.
That didn't really happen. Okay, number one, Super Mario Kart Plus, oh gosh, these are some real historical crimes. This actually dates Matthew.
Super Mario Kart, Star Fox and SNES Game Genie, Karts and Protectors, that's $40 in 1998. Number two, Game Boy Tetris, Karts Plus Protector, $20 in 1999. Super Mario RPG, Kart only, $59.99 in 2012.
I know that's like a pretty elusive favourite.
Number four, Metroid Prime Hunters, all inclusive, but at least partly bootlegged, $37.98 in 2013. So yeah, okay, interesting. That's some Particles.
So yes, Matthew, a bit of a random bunch there, like a history of war crimes. To be honest, it all looks like pretty tame stuff to me. Nothing too egregious in there.
And you've got a genuinely interesting purchase in a Squaresoft made Mario RPG before Nintendo kind of made its own RPGs. Thoughts on this?
Yeah, I mean, yeah, no stinkers in the mix, really. And price is very hard to call. I don't know what the state of things was in 1998 for pre-owned.
That's a bit of an ask, given the kind of pre-owned knowledge level that's clearly on display in this episode from me. Yeah, Mario RPG, I mean, you know, I don't know anyone who's got a physical copy of this. Super interesting.
The only danger thing with Mario RPG, you should clarify. I'm saying this. I'm going to say this is fine.
Not guilty. But you have to tell us, if you've ever made the demand for Gino from Mario RPG to be included in Smash Brothers, that was an incredibly tedious Nintendo meme for a while. Be honest.
If that thought has crossed your mind, then you will be executed after the fact, so please let us know.
Where are you at with people demanding that Mother 3 be localised, Matthew?
I mean, that's fine. I can understand you. People wanting to play that.
But Gino in Smash Brothers was just like... It was such an American Nintendo fan thing. It was just a big, big eye roll from me.
Like, Gino is not even that interesting. Anyway, let's not make that about this. You know, these are just four good things.
I'm content.
I'm not so sure about that Metroid Prime Hunters that was 38 years ago.
Oh, I forgot about that one. I'm so blinded by Mario RPG.
That's like not considered a classic by any means, is it? That's like probably the worst of that series. Probably.
Yeah, yeah, you're right, actually. Well, there's the 3DS one, the Federation Force or whatever. Yeah, I mean, it's still like novel, like the idea of controlling Metroid and seeing Nintendo kind of cram that control scheme into the DS.
I bought it for about 12 quid, like a year or so ago. Like it wasn't that much.
Yeah, but the other games are like...
Yeah, they are.
I think the other games are just too powerful. But please do let me know about the Gino thing. Because that really is a deal breaker.
Yeah, I'm just going to write 56 Conditional Release in brackets there. Yeah, that's good. Okay, good.
I will say, actually, to be a bit controversial, that Mario RPG might have been quite cool at the time, I would say, as SNES games have dated. It's not the prettiest to look at now.
Oh, no, I think it's quite ass to play now. But that's fine.
Is this one on the Switch, Matthew? They've done that one.
It's been on a Virtual Console because I've definitely played on Virtual Console.
Yeah, I used to have it on Wii. That's when I first played it.
Yeah, I think... Have they added it to Switch? I think they would have.
That would be mad if they haven't. Yeah, it's just fine. I think all of its ideas are improved upon in either Paper Mario or Mario & Luigi.
Yeah, it's just a bit of a first attempt. It's got some fun writing in it, but it's not like the modern Nintendo games where the localisation is just pretty amazing. It's just fine.
Yeah, fair enough. Actually, I'm going to skip the next one because it doesn't have a price in it. It's like an anecdote involving lots of time wasted modding a game.
These are probably better made, say, for the letters, but letters episodes, to be honest. We only have 18 exhibits. Matthew, I'm skipping that one.
Very good, very good podcasting. Exhibit M. This is really short.
My Korean copy of No More Heroes 1 and 2 on Switch and the contraband pumpkin raid news story, it came wrapped in like a Gangnam Fish Supper. £41 delivered on eBay, and it attaches a picture of the newspaper wrapping that contained it. And indeed, you can see pictures of pumpkins.
So I believe that No More Heroes 1 and 2 was just a limited run over here, which seems like a bit of a shame actually on Switch because I wouldn't mind having a copy of that, but serves me right for not pre-ordering, I suppose. But what do you make of this one, Matthew? Importing No More Heroes in physical form and coming with a pumpkin related news story from Korea.
Yeah, I don't really like lean either way with regards to this one, but the pumpkin wrapping is just such a delightful twist. I buy a lot of pre-owned books from American libraries, like Japanese crime novels that weren't published over here. And they come with all kinds of weird stuff.
People have left their old bookmarks in or people have written in them, or sometimes they were like gifts and they've got little emotional messages to people in them. It's quite sweet. I quite like the kind of detritus that comes with pre-owned things, as long as it's not pubes.
I draw the line at a mound of pubes. So, yeah, like, come on. This is awesome.
Let's give this a pass.
This went down well in the Discord, this one. People enjoyed the picture of pumpkins. Pumpkin race is just a good combination.
Can we put a picture of the pumpkin flyer on Twitter or something so people can see it? Because I want to see it as well.
Yep, I'll dig that out. That seems like a good use of my time.
We are a social media manager.
We've got a court update for you.
Oh yeah, go on.
An alien has just burst out of an air vent, but it wasn't at all scary, because it was one of the alien from Aliens, Cloning Marines, and it had many limbs.
One of the Haggrids dealt with it very succinctly. Yeah. Although the already deformed PS1 Haggrid has been further deformed by the acid's blood, which is tough.
Yeah. Oh, now that alien is spinning around and around and around in the air, and it's getting thinner and thinner, and its limbs are just turning into lines. Oh, it's so fucked.
Okay, good. Right. Exhibit N.
Oh, sorry. Just had a pause there, because Johnny Sasaki was thunder-shitting into a barrel. It was really fucking loud.
Absolutely carried through the courtroom there. Good. Good scene setting there.
Oh, even worse news. Johnny Sasaki has been invaded by the cosmic clones from Mera Galaxy, and is now reproducing every five seconds another Johnny Sasaki shitting into a barrel.
The ladder has been removed from his barrel, and a listerous inside drowning in the barrel. Okay, good. Right, exhibit N.
Good day to the honorable slash dishonorable Judge Castle slash Big Sammy. Delete is appropriate. I mean, I didn't do that, but still.
I don't have some long-winded narrative yarn to spin. Thank fuck for that. Simply that I found my partner's 3DS in the loft, and subsequently requisitioned it from her.
That's a theft, isn't it? Actually, it's not much of a gamer. I have now taken possession of it as my own and spent a sizable amount of time on eBay to find some relevant games for it.
I pray that the judges approve of my purchases, as some of them I know will irritate one judge in particular. Dragon Quest VIII on 3DS, £24.29, Majora's Mask on 3DS, £41, new and sealed, possibly to be kept to relic and sold at a later date if I can find another version cheaper, Matthew. Ocarina of Time, 3DS, £12.
Brackets, haggled a charity shop down for £15.
This person sucks. I can't believe it.
I'm going to sit on something till its price raises up, and also I stole it from a charity.
Yeah, absolutely accumulating renegade points here. Everyone in your party is going to fucking die in the suicide mission, mate.
It's got big, Judge Matthew Castle didn't like that in the corner of the screen.
Yeah, Telltale Games presents Judge Castle in five parts.
You've really messed up our chance of any romance happening.
Not for the three Hagrid's. Yeah, very good. Okay, Final Fantasy 3 on DS, 6.99.
Rayman Origins 3DS, 10 pounds. Oh, 23-in-1 Pokemon contains all the DS and GBA games, obviously of questionable legality. There's crimes all over the shop in here.
DS, 9.8, fucking hell. I can't await my fate of pulping slash upload to PlayStation Home or more, hopefully my freedom to continue scouring the second-hand 3DS market for respectably priced games. Let's be honest, some of the prices are...
Actually, I can't say that because it's a word about mental health we don't use now, but I still wish you well. I think that's a growler actually on Discord. I didn't write down the name, but I believe that's a growler.
So, Matthew, this one, it's like, there's nothing wrong with the games as such apart from the illegal Pokémon one, which obviously, you know, piracy, can't condone that, but he undoes it by being a scoundrel. Don't you think so? It's a real bastard arc here.
It's like, not only did you... The rest of it made me question, did you steal the 3DS of your partner? Does she know you took it?
There's part of that to it. And then the crimes just pile up. The sitting on Majora's Mask and then haggling down a charity shop.
This is like, yeah, outrageous behavior. Thoughts, Matthew?
on 3DS. Yeah, 10 pounds. Not its natural home, I'd say.
Majora's Mask, like, the whole keeping it wrapped, that sucks.
I don't mind the JLPG purchases. It has crossed my mind when I look at the 3DS and I think things I want to get my hands on from the eShop or other means before we move on from 3DS, as it were. The Dragon Quest 8 ports are quite high up that list.
I got 7 and 8 before they were still on sale. They are nice things to have for sure.
Yeah, I think we've just got to set a set. I can't let a scoundrel like this go scot-free based on a couple of good purchases. He's got to go into the swimming pool.
Okay, very good. The ladder will be removed at a later date?
Yeah, it's very difficult. We have to wait for the first person to die before we can put the ladder back in. So the second person can get in.
Otherwise, the first person will use the ladder to get out. It's a whole thing.
Yeah, the pathfinding. Just out of control. Very anticlimactic executions here.
Deferred gratification though. Check back in a week and you'll have a great time. Okay, we have five entries left.
I'll just fire these. Slightly non-Kosher Games Court entries. These are not technically pre-owned games, but they were boxed copies of no longer new games from online or local shops, essentially bargain bin purchases.
So I feel they are still in the spirit of Games Court. I'll be the judge of that. Still in the spirit of an institution that is cloning a man sat in a barrel full of shit.
That's amazing. What spirit? The purchases are from roughly 2010 to 2014 when I was a teenager living at home with disposable income from my job at the local library and no responsibilities.
I was a bit inspired by Samuel mentioning a weakness for games related to FAF, which is very much something I loved. A cheap reduced to clear collector's edition would get me to buy pretty much anything, as evidenced by this list. I'm easily tricked into artificial scarcity.
They're all PC games. Exact prices and dates included when available, i.e. I could dig out the e-mail receipts from online orders.
Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, £3.98, 2011. Snore. Well, yeah, the listeners didn't like that one, did they?
Jesus. Bioshock 2 Collector's Edition, £14.20, 2011. This one came with a nice art book, a soundtrack CD.
The Bioshock 1 soundtrack on vinyl and three posters. I actually had this. It was a beautiful thing, Matthew.
I had to get rid of it when I moved house, though, because it was massive.
How many times did you listen to the vinyl?
Well, I actually sellotaped the sides of it and put it in a frame, which is what you're meant to do with vinyl, isn't it? It was a joke. I didn't really.
It was a joke.
You could just do it once and say it's any record, couldn't you? See that record there? That's The Beatles.
See that record there? It's The Barge Dogs.
You just don't know. What a great talking point, yeah. The posters were quite fine, actually, because they had hidden messages on them, if you have an ultraviolet light or whatever, and you just put it in there and it would show you fucked up, kind of like Bioshock after the fall stuff under these, what's it called, propaganda posters.
Pretty cool.
If I lived in a rented room, I would never put on a UV light.
Well, this is bath, you know. What are people getting up to?
Horror show.
Someone spilled some truffle oil there, you know what I mean? God, let's move on. Splinter Cell Conviction Collector's Edition, around £15, came with a Steelbook soundtrack CD and a Sam Fisher figure.
I already owned and loved the game, so this was bought for the extra stuff. For a Sam Fisher figure. I'm not dying for one of those.
It's iconic.
In that game as well, it's the least recognizable Sam Fisher.
It's just like someone's dad, right?
Yeah, exactly. It could be the protagonist of any sort of noughties action game. Gothic 3 Collector's Edition, around £15, came with a soundtrack CD, cloth map.
I like those. Art booklet and a necklace. Similarly, I already owned Gothic 3.
Guild Wars Nightfall Collector's Edition, around £10, too much extra stuff to mention it all. It included soundtrack CD, map, poster and a cardboard standee. Guild Wars Factions Collector's Edition, around £5, too much extra stuff to mention it all.
But it also had a poster, map, etc. You get the idea, Matthew. So the thing about this one is that the listener is misusing the word faff way too many times here.
Every time they say like stuff or like extra stuff, they use the word faff, which is not what the word faff is for. I'm not saying you should kill them on that alone, Matthew, but what do you make of this pile of stuff?
I do not like video game collector's clutter. Like I don't have collector's editions. The few collector's editions we have are things that were sent when I was working on like RPS or whatever, and I just don't know what to do with them.
So they sit in my living room, in my dining room, and I really resent them for existing. The idea of only game already, but buying it second time, because you just need to have that cloth map, that's like that's extremely cursed to me.
I don't know, it depends on the game. Like if I owned a house, I would totally see the appeal of like buying some old big box PC games or something. But because I rent, that seems like a completely pointless purchase, you know.
I forgot the big, but I do like big PC boxes. And I am sad that we threw away most of my childhood PC games and just kept like the discs because the boxes were part of the appeal. I don't know.
I'm not on the same wavelength as this defendant.
Marcus is the defendant.
And like Alphys and Sherry, I mean, the people have decided that it's not beloved.
It's like, oh, the people vote for Brexit, Matthew. Jesus.
Like, yeah, but like, you know, if this was a court on Samuel Roberts Peninsula, that would probably be a ticket to the big leagues, but here...
Maybe that thing I said a few weeks ago about my days of being thin skinned are over. It's a complete fucking lie, Matthew, and we're gonna have a big bust up over Alpha Centauri yet again.
No, it's not the Alpha Centurion-ness of this that I think sinks this entry. I think it's like...
Just an overall ehh quality to the whole thing, you know?
Yeah, and it's like, I really like Sprinter Cell Conviction, but Sam Fisher figure from this particular game, does he even have the iconic headset on? I don't think he does in this.
My favorite of this era collector's edition was, as discussed, the Alan Wake book. That was not actually a book, but it looked like a book. And you opened it and just had the game and then a sort of soundtrack sliding around in it or something.
That was quite a fun one. But again, I found it took up too much shelf space, so in the end it just took the game box out and then got rid of the book.
So, yeah. This is a no from me, which is quite a casual way of saying, I'm putting you to death on a couch that's on fire.
Okay, cool. Very good. We've cycled back around to the first set of means of execution.
That's good.
Well, the swimming pool is full now because it's had three people. It's only three by three towers like it. I can't physically get more people in the swimming pool.
I would if I could. And trust me, I've tried.
Okay, good. Exhibit P. Hello Giant Men.
Big fan of both of you. That's nice, isn't it? Sad that we'll only now get one weekly dose of Matthew in my podcatcher.
It's a reference there to Matthew leaving the RPS podcast because this is too lucrative and successful.
This is too busy.
Yeah, you are running out of time. It's true. Yeah, very busy man.
My submission is the licensed PS2 game Dark Angel based on the weird sci-fi show starring Jessica Alba from the early noughties, produced by James Cameron, if I recall. I bought this at a second hand junk shop in Pittsburgh for $10 a few years ago, solely based on my memories of watching the show as a kid in hotels and rental houses when I had cable TV, which had cable TV. I've had about 15 minutes of it, but the controls were a nightmare as I sat on my shelf since.
Worth it? All the best to you both, Nate. This would be a great one to sort of like double bill with the alias game Matthew from Acclaim.
That's what I was going to say. Like, who am I to judge who bought the alias game, which was just so bad? Oh, that's a bit of a tough week for James Cameron's something something.
What I like about Nate's email is he's quite honest about having played it and it's sucking. But then it's probably also quite a fun talking point, right? In the room you can be like, that's my copy of James Cameron's Dark Angel.
It got worse reviews than the Alias game. The Alias game got like sixes and this got like fours and fives.
That might just be tied to like how people felt about the shows.
The show got cancelled after two seasons, I think.
Who liked Dark Angel? No one.
Yeah, I don't know. No one. Yeah, I'm not sure.
I wasn't even aware this had a tie in actually. That's like, yeah, does not ring a bell. Yeah, this is like 2002, this game, long time ago now.
Yeah, I mean, Jessica Albert did, according to Wikipedia, reprise her role from the series.
It was announced at E3 2002, shortly after the TV series was cancelled. That's a great circumstance in which to release a game, I'm sure.
We're basically thinking this is the third season of Dark Angel. I bet they said that.
Yeah, I would have done.
Yeah, like, it's got character, but it is dogshit.
You're taking a surprising amount of time to decide for this one.
Well, I just keep thinking back to Alias. I bought Alias. Like, would I want to be executed for that?
But I think we're right. Alias is a little better. I think we're going, yeah, it's into the room with the slightly dangerous dishwasher TV combo.
Yeah, I think that, like, as someone who, my version of the Alias game was Buffy Chaos Bleeds on PS2, which I think again was like a slight, a slight cut above here. So, yeah, that's, it's a fun entry, though, Dark Angel, so thank you for that. Okay, I'm now one, actually, like, in the red now, so I've got to turn this around with three entries to go.
Exhibit Q. Hiya, I bought Midtown Madness 3 for the original Xbox, Xbox three times as the first two copies didn't work. I will add they were all pubeless.
I paid £1.50, £2.19, £2.25 for the three copies. There's a few more games here. Canyon Lynch 2 on PS3 for £3.50, although the case was very sticky.
Yeah, well, that speaks for the Canyon Lynch 2 heads for sure.
Virtua Tennis 4 for the PS Vita for £4.99. The Chinese language version of Taiko no Tatsujin for the PS Vita for around £25 in the basement of a shopping centre in Kong Kong next door to a sex toy shop. That's not the retailer's fault, is it?
The first three also don't think shame. The first three Professor Layton Games for the DS for £6. That's pretty good.
I couldn't figure out how to delete the previous owner's save files, so it always felt a little odd. We're booting up the games, having to scroll past both Susan and Rebecca's previous saves. What sort of life did Susan and Rebecca lead, I wonder?
Fusion Frenzy for the original Xbox for £259. I can hear Matthew groaning already, but I will add this is Bill Gates' favourite video game. That's not a good thing in your favour.
I'd have left that out there, dog. I hope I live. But as they say, a pulpit in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Best wishes, Tom Delty. Fucking hell, what a mix there. I think overall those games are pretty good.
I don't think I'm having a Chinese version of Taiko no Tatsujin makes a big difference, really. It's just a rhythm action game, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah.
Professor Layton, you know, six pounds, pretty legit, if anything.
Six pounds each for all three?
For all three.
That's pretty good. Those are the three good ones.
Yeah. Kane Lynch 2 is the most dubious one. It's like Midtown Madness 3.
You bought it three times, but there's a reason for that. You still had to have spent like under eight quid total.
Yeah. I don't have experience with Midtown Madness.
Yeah, it's like...
But loved?
I think it's like... I remember the... I think the first two came out on PC, and they were very well liked.
And then the third one, I think, just came out on Xbox, then the series is sort of over then. And then I feel like it was kind of maybe sort of replaced by Burnout and, you know, GTA. Like it just sort of, yeah, didn't really exist past the launch of Xbox.
I thought I had this. It was on a... I think it came on a disc with my Xbox.
There was like two games on one disc kind of deal. And it was all right. I just remember driving around urban locations thinking this is quite a pretty game.
I just looked it up on Wikipedia and went down to the scores, which is pretty high for this. It's like 80% on game rankings. But it's one of those Wikipedia entries where it just plucks like lots of random facts out from loads of different reviews.
And my eyes were just drawn to the sentence, Christian Nutt of GameSpy enjoyed the Capture the Gold game mode, a variant on classic Capture the Fat game types. Thanks, Wikipedia.
I think this is that period where Microsoft basically made all its developers at the time just make their games for consoles instead of PC now. Which is how you end up with MechWarrior and Crimson Skies on Xbox as well. They were a successful PC series and they had to make them for console.
And to mix results, it would seem, because a lot of those series just died after that. But yeah, Fusion Frenzy is a bad one as well. That's a dud.
That is £2.59. I think that's on Game Pass anyway.
Yeah, that's just a round now. I feel like everyone has access to that.
It's a bad Mario Party anyway, wasn't it? That's what it was.
Bad Mario Party, which is already just a bad time.
Well, at the time, Mario Party had a slightly better reputation, but yeah.
Hmm, unearned. But listen, Mario Party is not on trial here. That would be trial of the century on Castle Island.
The Layton Trio, that's really won me over. Yeah, not guilty.
Okay, fair enough. I think that's fair. I think overall, there's more good games than bad in that list.
Yeah, and a foreign copy of a game that doesn't require language to understand, that's not a problem. That's fine.
And the sex shop thing, that doesn't change my impression of the shop.
We don't know the story there. We don't know which business was there first.
Maybe it's all very innocent.
If you give us the address, we'll look into it. And if the sex shop was there first, then we've got a problem.
And mysteriously, in the next Games Court, the sex shop has been moved in its entirety to Matthew Castle Island.
What are you saying? That's not my style. This is a very chaste island.
Some would say too chaste.
Yeah, that's it. Chaste and then also Randy Newman is incarcerated in the forest somewhere and is not allowed to return to Europe.
No one's ever in the mood for anything hot and steamy here because they're all extremely put off by the endless sound of chattering hen's teeth. It's really a very hellish landscape.
It's hard to feel too horny when there is no time as well. With no hours or minutes, how is one to get a bit randy? It's not going to happen.
Yeah, and you've got Eugene Aka-Tutton at you the whole time.
Okay, right. I've only got two more here. They're quite short.
Exhibit R. Dear Honourable Judges. Just Games and Prices, Matthew.
Your favourite. Great. Simpsons Hit and Run, PS2, £12.50.
Time split is £2.00. PS2 £9.00. Controversial around here.
Uses it to win a draft, then slags it off the rest of the time. Fucking Matthew Castle. Wii, here comes the pain.
PS2, £13.00 for my sins. That's the one I've played the most. I know nothing about Wii, so whatever.
Banjo-Tooie, N64, £58.00 before I had an Xbox for Rare Replay. Rogue Squadron, N64, £10.00. I regret nothing.
Thomas MB. I think there's more good games than bad there, Matthew, but I suppose Banjo-Tooie is a big one. My memory of this is it's more sprawling than the first one, but not as good.
That's my memory of Banjo-Tooie.
Am I right or wrong there? That's just the arc of Rare's platformers. They're getting bigger and worse with each entry.
Because after this, you then get just the fucking wild sprawl of Donkey Kong 64, which is kind of rank. So desired at the time, but even back then we were like, nah, this is bad. I'm not wild about the Banjo-Kazooie kind of line of platformers, but I only think they are platformers.
I think they're like weird ability puzzlers. They just don't really do it for me. I know that they are loved, but it's well known that Castle Island isn't big into the Rare platformers.
That's too much.
Sounds about right price-wise to me.
That may be what it goes for, but that isn't right.
So we've got Simpsons Hit and Run, one of the more legitimate GTA rifts. TimeSplitters 2, which everyone apart from you says is good.
This is very much like the contrarian entry. This is me being like, er, TimeSplitters, er, Rare platformers on N64. Two very unpopular opinions.
Rogue Squadron, a classic. I played through it myself last year, again. Really, really good still.
Yeah.
Fucking hard last level.
I think there'll be like an international incident if Matthew Castle Island really comes out against TimeSplitters 2 and Rare platformers. So purely out of cowardice, because I've got a pretty sweet deal here, and I don't want people taking away my fucked up hens.
So we'll let it go on the grounds of diplomacy.
Fucked up hens. Okay, good. I think that actually this means I can't lose, but it can be a draw.
I mean, I would say like one dead client is a big loss. And we've literally stuffed a swimming pool with so many bodies, we can't drown more people in it.
Yeah. I mean, I'm the only lawyer on this island. So I'm going to take a picture of that pool and put it on my website.
Oh, wait, we don't have the internet here. I'm going to put it on my flyers and stick them around the island and be like, you know, you could end up like this. But there will be another one of like some people leaving in a little boat.
Or you could be like this. It's like, you know, you roll the dice when you hire a big Sammy.
What, they flee the island if they're found not guilty.
What does happen to the not guilty people here? I never really thought about it.
I don't know. Well, I'll have to ponder that for the next episode.
Yeah, that's it. They never leave. They just become like, yeah, they just wander aimlessly.
That's cute people going, wait, there's going to be another episode of this?
It's like the sort of Jeff Vandermeer annihilation thing. They become the chickens with the teeth. That's what happens to the old innocent listeners.
They're just like, they're chickens now, but with teeth.
Very bad energy.
Okay, last one. Exhibit S. This is, this goes back a bit.
So this was, this refers to the GTA Clones on Trial episode so we did with Jeremy, Matthew, which was a good pod, wasn't it? Driver 3, five pounds, bought after that GTA Clones episode and because I played and finished the first Driver this year, so I thought I'd go through the series, they should do a remake called Drewanver. Grown, that's a grown-from-me dog.
Did you watch the opening cutscene and think it was Michael Mann-esque? Well, did you? No shade on Jeremy, that was a strong take.
It was good. That was certainly good podcasting for us. Who are we to complain?
I also bought TimeSplitters for five pounds on PS2, despite owning a broken copy. I wonder if that's the original TimeSplitters.
TimeSplitters 1?
That's weird. I suppose, you know, fair enough. Less effort than getting it cleaned or fixed.
Others, MGS Special Missions, 18 pounds. Twilight Princess, 8 pounds. I'm assuming that's on the Wii, because the other versions are really expensive.
Project Gotham Racing 2, 1 pounds. The Getaway, 3 pounds. Guitar Hero, 1, 2, 3.
Rock the 80s and guitar, sorry. Oh, and a guitar for PS2. Plus a second copy of Guitar Hero 2, when the first one didn't work, for 35 pounds total.
That's quite a lot of stuff there. But playing Guitar Hero on PS2 feels wrong to me. I really think that that's a HD era thing.
Yeah, I suppose it did take off on PS2, didn't it?
Yeah, my big Guitar Hero memory is the second one on PS2.
I feel like everyone just needed the USB version of those instruments so they could play them on the new consoles.
Maybe that's true. But I have happy memories of playing Cheap Chicks Surrender endlessly on a loop that Christmas.
Very nice. I have unhappy memories of going to lots of NAF house parties where Guitar Hero was the main event.
Oh, don't ever do that to someone.
That was a tough era.
That's a palpable event.
So yeah, you've got Driver 3 and Time Split is the original, Twilight Princess, MGS Special Missions, which is interesting. That's basically lots and lots of VR scenarios. So basically levels, Metal Gear levels without any art, essentially.
Project Gotham Racing 2, The Getaway, and then four Guitar Hero games and a guitar. That's all right. That seems like a reasonable pile of stuff.
I think weren't the VR missions just included in the PC version?
Oh, that would make sense, I guess.
I've definitely played them on PC or something.
There's loads of them, that's the thing. You'd remember it because there were fucking tons of those missions. They were pretty good, though.
They would encourage you to do very specific challenges. You could use the weapons more because Metal Gear Solid was not that long. So you didn't get to do much stealth and much action.
It was just kind of over. This is just pure level design, basically. What do you reckon?
I think that's an interesting pick. I do have a fondness for early Guitar Heroes. I don't think I played one beyond 3, apart from the DS one.
Oh, yeah. I managed to convince myself it was great, even though it basically gave you worse arthritis than Kid Ico's Uprising. And it was like, do you want to hear all these pop songs crushed down to fit a DS gut?
You do not. Fucking Gwen Stefani's Spiderwebs screeching out of a DS at bad times. What are the other ones?
A Twilight Princess? I can't really knock that. Aequid?
Yeah.
And that feels like that's just everywhere in pre-owned. It's just one of those games that sold so many copies. You're never going to struggle to get it.
I guess so. I just have a great curse about the idea of I'm going to play Twilight Princess, the non-HD version, now. Fucking jagged lines all over your HDTV when you plug it in as Link goes over that fucking infinite bridge.
Yeah, I forgot this is pre-owned, that you're buying it now. In my mind, I was like, oh yeah, buying that at the time. That was good.
Yeah. And you'd wait, you'd get, well, would you get the HD Wii? You won't, probably not.
That's equally cursed for other reasons.
So fascinated by the idea of the Guitar Hero DS game now. I'm just looking it up and I'm like, what the fuck? That's like what a weird relic that is.
Weird thing to play.
Pretty now set this as well, to be honest.
Yeah, but I don't know. I didn't really have many music opinions. I think I reviewed that friend game and liked it enough.
Yeah, why not? This is fine. I'm going to say not guilty.
It's not the big dramatic conclusion you want to an episode of Games Court. Someone just sort of sighing and saying it's fine. But that is how I feel.
I am defeated. It's Monday night and I need a dinner. That's like the energy pulsating through this.
I've got some fish chips and peas waiting for me.
Oh, that's nice. Where did you get that from?
Cooking it.
Oh, fair enough. I thought you were going to the oyster shell.
No, I never get takeaway fish and chips.
Really? That's what I mean.
I'm not a big fish and chips guy. It's so far down my list of what I would have takeaway.
Okay, fair enough. Well, there you go.
Because it's just like, oh, do you just want endless chips? It's just like two things over and over again, isn't it? It's a bit like, oh, give it a break.
That's the worst take on this episode. And that's saying something. We've had some fucking shit from our listeners here.
And that is still the worst.
This is where you tell a long story about, yeah, I bought a box of fish and chips once. And I took it home, opened it, it was full of pubes.
I wish, because at least that would vary it up a bit. Otherwise, it's just like, oh, more chips, is it?
That's a bad day. I think it's going to go down badly on this podcast. But it's a lively way to end a Games Court.
It's sort of like petered out. It's sort of like in the middle there, had a lot of energy. And then towards the end, I think the two hosts were quite tired.
The Monday night energy kicked in. And the games were quite inoffensive. So we're just like, oh, yeah, three Professor Leighton games.
That's pretty good. Yeah, not guilty. And yeah, it's been a while since you killed anyone.
I think you need to smell blood in order for this to be like a five-star podcast, Matthew. But I'll settle for a three-star podcast, so that's all good. Okay, this episode is over.
Thank you so much for this thing. Games Court is complete. I have won yet again.
So I get to live, I guess, and I get to fight in court another day. The Hagrid's have burst into applause. That's great.
The aliens are missing. Not sure what happened there. That's kind of upsetting.
The computer from Perfect Dark has closed and gone to sleep. I'll be taking that home with me, I suppose. Yes, good.
It's all done, Matthew. Where can people find you on social media? If you would like to submit future Games Court entries, it's backpagegames.gmail.com.
Or you can put them in our Discord and when I copy and paste them into this document, the formatting will be completely fucked. Email is slightly preferred, I guess, but easier to keep on top of. I'm Samuel W.

Goodbye.
Bye for now.
