Hello and welcome to the Backpage XL, a patron exclusive episode of the Backpack Backpage Podcast, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.

Matthew
00:29
Hello.

Samuel
00:29
Matthew, would you say that your COVID voice made you more or less sexy? And uh now that it's fading, how do you feel about that?

Matthew
00:36
I mean to me, less sexy because I felt terrible and my body was full of gunk I was trying to get rid of. to the listeners seemingly sexier because my rough voice is better than whatever this is. Um Sorry, I I got better, so usual service will resume. Yeah, it's just one of those unfortunate things. Oh that's the best of both worlds, isn't there, where you can have the nice gravelly voice and um you know a career in audio but be sick all the time so I'd I'd rather be healthy and sort of force people to enjoy my regular speaking voice.

Samuel
01:15
Your squawk as you called it on blue sky.

Matthew
01:17
My squawk.

Samuel
01:17
Um you've been to the London Film Festival this week as well. Uh how are you doing uh from that you did three films back to back right and um did you see them all in that big the the main hall the festival hall which uh I wouldn't say has seating designed f to sustain an ass for more than two hours

Matthew
01:37
Like normally it'd be for a performance where I guess there'd be an interval in the middle, which there wasn't here. Um my ass was pretty sore by the end of Wake Up Dead Man. Uh and uh I I I think that like numbed it a little bit for the rest of the day. It's sort of like um wake up dead ass, you might say. Uh that's what I should have said.

Samuel
02:00
That's that should have been the tweet. That's okay. I mean I had to think of it with like a It's like a three second time delay there as I thought of a joke just in real time.

Matthew
02:08
I had a a tweet going for a while which I didn't put out about Like who murdered my ass in that film and him like working that out as a mystery, but I yeah, I couldn't quite get the wording right, so I abandoned it.

Samuel
02:21
Well look forward to the XX XL tier where you'll get all of the drafts of Matthew's unused tweets. So that'll be um something you can look forward to. We'll be pasting all those into a big big Word document and uh yeah selling that for twenty two pounds a month for that one. Um so by all means back us and uh yeah read all of Matthew's um material that was not deemed suitable for the public. Too spicy. Indeed. Um so We played a load of NES games this episode. You might remember last month we played Atari 50 and talked about all of those games and it was a I th I think it was a really successful episode. We had quite a lot to say about about all these games that we had limited experience with and um I actually don't precisely know what Matthew's relationship is with Inez so coming into this th there's maybe a bit of ambiguity there for me. But um we for this episode we basically just jumped into Every game, more or less, that's on the Nintendo um Switch Online's uh kind of NES catalogue, played them all um for varying lengths of time. in a kind of like kind of grab bag uh sort of fashion. Um really like having a sort of tin of roses except you know um 70% of them might be like jube of dubious flavour Um you're kind of searching for the thirty percent that is uh that is good.

Matthew
03:36
That's caramel keg.

Samuel
03:38
Indeed.

Matthew
03:39
What is the caramel keg of Nez

Samuel
03:40
Yeah. Has Caramel Keg been sort of reduced to a a sort of like a smaller keg, um as a result of Coszy Lives? Perhaps like a I don't know, a caramel flask or a sm some kind of smaller object.

Matthew
03:53
Someone at work was saying that when caramel cake, which for people who don't know what we're talking about, is shaped like half a barrel and is full of caramel They used to get two of them, lick them and stick them together into a complete barrel and then eat like a full caramel barrel back when that was a thing.

Samuel
04:09
Oh well that's uh that's actually like great trivia. Just like how the quality street chocolate was a tie into some kind of film, wasn't it? Isn't that like a thing that happened? That's the uh the trivia that people always wheel out about those ones.

Matthew
04:21
But uh Oh isn't it?

Samuel
04:24
Is it a play? Is that what it is? You've probably seen that in Bath. Probably David Morrissey was in it and you were like, Yeah, that was great performance by David and the best adaptation of Quality Street I've ever seen. I imagine that's the thing that happened to you, Matthew.

Matthew
04:37
It was.

Samuel
04:38
Thank you for the uh The follow up there. Um so yes, uh lots to talk about in this episode. I sort of um I will say, top line I found that Atari 50 gave that last episode some real shape and like so much to build an episode plan out of. And the Nintendo Switch Online service is kind of like Uh like getting a shotgun blast just full of games really. And so um it's really like uh it's really not dissimilar to Getting an emulation handheld, going in and seeing what the um the people who have illegally uploaded games onto that thing have sold to sold it to you with. So it's not massively different to that. And um I did want to ask Matty how you found the research for this episode compared to the Atari one. My research

Matthew
05:26
I assume you mean just playing the games because that's I mean that's literally why it is. I played all the games, uh obviously not to completion, a lot of them But oh well, we can get into how long we played each of them for. Um but I wouldn't say like in the absence of a an Atari 50s style rapping on that service, I didn't go out of my way to like educate myself about Lines. I didn't like read loads about the news. Uh I just played the games and thought, yeah, well we'll just have some opinions on that.

Samuel
06:00
Yeah, that's kinda what I did as well. I I did look up basically there was a few games where I thought, I wonder if this has a reputation. And so I did come in.

Matthew
06:16
There are there are a couple of like some quite odd things in there which given some of the amazing things that aren't in there, you're like, how the hell did this thing ever end up in this collection? But again we'll get to those.

Samuel
06:27
Indeed, Matthew. So um Yeah, I mean before we jump into it, I mean I'll I'm gonna fess up to something, first of all, for this episode, right? It did come in hot, and I while I did play a few of the key games on the Bottom three rows of the catalogue here. I only got through the top eleven rows of the um of the chronological order of NES games on here. So I don't have observations on All of the stuff that was at the very bottom. Um, so I might lean on you for that one. I think there's one was there a game called Immortal down there? Some quite strange looking stuff. I don't know if we had our libraries arranged in the same way. Oh yeah, that's a good point actually, because at first I didn't have it arranged that way. I had it so I think one I think the first game that came up at the top might it actually might have been in sort of release order on the service. So Oh, I think that's what I played them in. Yeah, exactly.

Matthew
07:20
So that's so I thought Unhelpful.

Samuel
07:23
No, but that's um that's the thing, is I I played the first five games and I thought I wonder if you can sort these by original release date. You could, which was quite Uh it was like as much context as Nintendo was willing to give me really, was the the kind of years that these games came out in. So that was kinda useful in a way. Um but because the um you don't just have Nintendo's games here, you have games from quite a lot of different companies, it's sort of You cannot really neatly package the history together in quite the same way as you could with Atari 50, where it is a bit like, oh yeah, this this bloke in America just thought, oh, what if I try this? And then Learn Behold a six out of ten game was born, which was like most of the Atari um collection. By this point I think game development's come along like a little bit and you know these games are getting a bit uh getting more elaborate and start to feel less like the very, very basic tenets of games and more like fully formed ideas that would be evolved upon in years to come. And so Yeah, it's there's definitely kind of like a step forward there. Um but yes, I will confess Matthew, I didn't get through absolutely all of them. Um Yoshi, for example, I'll be leaning on you for that one. Oh man, you you you didn't miss much from that one.

Matthew
08:33
Um that this is the thing, I did get through all of them, but It's completely scattershot and in the order that they were uploaded onto the service. So there's like no rhyme or reason to any of it. It's really chaotic. So I saw the question in the plan which was about sort of how things evolve over time. And I have like a you know a basic idea of when a lot of these things came out, but for my playing today, like that chronology is absolutely scrambled. And I just have no idea what happened in in l for like ten years.

Samuel
09:03
But No, that's fair enough. The thing is it moves so quickly anyway, so it's it's not like there's a It's hard to construct too much of a narrative, really, but it's what I will say that I I kind of observed about it is that um you sort of you find that It it's like the inverse arc to Atari where things just seem to get worse as time went on. Um I mean first of all it's a much smaller time period that's being covered here and you know, one piece of hardware that was a success, um particularly in Japan um and North America. And so it's it's not really there's not really a a kind of straight narrative in Atari sense that it was a it was a succession of uh naff follow-up machines that just didn't do the job and then um increasingly dire games um that they were basically and then they're basically pissing money down the drain as you got to the um the jaguar and it was a you know a very easy to follow narrative. Um you can't really draw out those same sort of conclusions here, but I will observe that you definitely see the games getting nicer looking as time goes on. I mean it's it's it's really obvious that um Kirby's adventure is like uh a late uh you know, a very late con game for the platform. It is by far the nicest game I've played out of this bunch, I would say. Just sort of like To the point where I was I I that's that's surely a magic trick that it they've that they did that at the time on this hardware. Um so yeah that's um That was kind of like one part of it, but I wouldn't say there was a there was an easy narrative to really kind of build out of that. I mean, you kind of have this thing where it's this on-ramp of very simple sports games and Mario And then you wait two years and basically Zelda comes along. And then I think Metroid is very s very quickly after that. Um and so it's things just move so so fast. And uh yeah, and then it you kind of like It feels like when you play it in release order, it feels like the crowning achievement of that generation is Mario Bros. 3. You know? That's what feels like the Not the last, the only sort of big moment at the end of that sort of console's lifespan, but like also, you know, you kinda get you get punch out after that as well. And um the games do keep going into the nineties, but Yeah, it's sort of like the the big hit is sort of start it kind of like make form that kind of arc basically. So you have Mario Bros. kick it off, then you have Mario Bros 3 sort of wrap it up. It's Kind of like the very basic w way that the Nintendo Switch Online presents the story of the Niz, you know? Right. Um uh uh unintentionally, basically. So yeah. Um so I did want to uh address the fact that when we Did the Atari episode I think a couple of people, not you know, not as criticism, mentioned that we were a bit US centric with how we talked about Atari. Um and that the crash, uh the fabled video game industry crash uh you know E. T. carts being buried in the desert and such didn't really happen in Europe. And I thought this is a fair criticism, Matthew. We didn't really talk about uh what was going on in the UK at all on that episode. Um did you have any any kind of like observations based on that?

Matthew
12:00
You know, we'd been severely US Atari pilled by spending all that time in the Atari 50 collection. which is entirely through the lens of that American company and it's mostly American fans. Uh you know, I yeah, I didn't go out of my way to to to to sort of filling the gaps around that and I r you know I realize there's there's like a huge blind spot for me. That that generation, probably the following generation, you know, what even what's going on. sort of around the NES is is a bit of a mystery to me. Um, you know, just as someone who hasn't gone back to sort of do do their their homework. And probably never will. Um, you know, and I I only really know the NES as as well as I do because I worked on a Nintendo magazine, we had a retro section. And it it was, you know, one of my monthly duties to not look uh shit and embarrass myself in those pages. Um so I you know, I just had to really do the work to to make that work. Um but uh yeah, no I I don't know. I don't know what the solution to that is, uh, unfortunately. You know, maybe we'll start spreading some myths about we have to pick a very British game that got buried somewhere incredibly British. Um like a sort of uh I don't know, a worms game that got buried in the late district or something.

Samuel
13:24
Yeah, that's the thing is like I I I sort of I only really experienced I only really know about those games because occasionally I'd read digitizer talking about school days, for example, and then be kinda curious about what that was. So Yeah. Yeah. It's but you know, the the the the simple truth is we're just a bit too young for that to be our you know, credibly part of our history and unless Someone packages those up in some kind of like cursed compilation for us to dig into where a bunch of men in their sixties and seventies talk about making these things. Um it's probably not gonna happen or I just have to read every retro gamer back issue till I can pretend I have that knowledge. Um but yes, I'll definitely kind of own up to that being a a thing. That's certainly um certainly fair. We just don't have that knowledge, um frankly. And we were definitely experiencing it the way that Americans did. Um and there'll definitely be a bit of that in this episode because it was interesting uh There seemed to be a bit of debate online about how big a deal the NES really was in the UK. And it seems like you get some people saying, Oh no, the master system was a bigger deal here or microcomputers were just a big deal throughout the eighties here, so the NES was never quite the same um sort of thing and Nintendo didn't have the same presence and then it feels like the the console wars as we know them really just start in the nineties, you know, with the next generation, um with the Mega Drive and the SNES. So That's but there seemed to be a better back and forth than that. It seemed to depend on whichever European country you lived in. The situation with how like n how dominant Nintendo was varied depending on where you were living. So you know, I was reading someone in Italy saying that, oh yeah, Nintendo were definitely a big deal here, but people in the UK being like, they were kind of just one of, you know, a bunch of different people who are making and releasing games and they didn't have the same marketing presence here and So on and so forth, Matthew. Um yeah, I mean I I would like love to know what your relationship to the NES was before this. Um did you ever cover the virtual console games on Endgamer?

Matthew
15:22
My childhood experience of the NES was I never ha I never owned one, um, but coveted it. Uh, you know, I had a couple of friends, you know, some of my very earliest memories are of going to friends' houses and playing uh yeah Super Mario Bros. 2 uh Chippendale game, the Rescue Rangers game, not the Chippendales like the male strippers. Um and uh uh yeah, so you know, d just n knowing that there was a box that sat under people's TVs that let this amazing stuff happen. Um You know, never yeah, never got one, you know, our first uh console at home was was the Mega Drive, so um You know, that then it's just a thing that you do rediscover through Virtual Console and yeah, like you say, working on Endgamer. Um I felt like I had to sort of die dive into the retro stuff. Like as as a staff writer on the mag, uh I I I got given a lot of the retro stuff to do. Um and I th I I know never talked to Greener about this, but I I actually thought it was kind of deliberate to sort of make me sort of dig into some stuff which I wasn't as familiar with, because I was quite honest about what I had and hadn't played. Uh the history lesson, which was the opening spread of our retro section, um, which was uh every month. kind of explaining the history of a of a games company who you know we associate with Nintendo platforms in some way. um and you know that would sort of fill me in on the information about the actual like company and the players involved and then there was always a big box out about like the nine big games that you had to kind of play from them, a couple that were on Virtual Console ideally and then some recommendations. So yeah, I'd just go on and play all these games on emulator and to to get a sense of them and take screenshots of and so e even though it's not like a massively like lived experience in in like an you know, honest sort of growing up sort of nostalgia way. Um you know, I f I feel like it was a kind of uh baptism by fire and it did kind of force me to get my head around some of this stuff. Um A lot of it taken at speed. There's so many NES games that I've played like the opening five minutes of. Um, you know, continue that trend in this episode. Um And you know, some of them I go back to actually going back to some of them for this episode, there were things which I'd sort of written off which I thought, oh actually there's there's a a little bit more to that or that's more to my tastes now. Um It's it's really amazing what the rewind function can do for some of these games because a lot of them are just brutally difficult and you don't make any progress because of that difficulty. So having the option, as you do with the the Switch Online games the sort of the virtual console on the switch is you can yeah rewind the games when you die and then just sort of course correct and a lot of these games you know You're only cheating yourself and blah blah blah and all that. But uh you know, I was able to make more progress in these games than I've ever made. in these games in the past. So that was uh yeah, like a disnoppy to go, Oh, that's what the second level of this looks like. That's um a bit of an eye opener. So um yeah, which was a long and rambling way of saying kind of a a a f a sort of fake a fake historic relationship with these games. Um which, you know, was s would loop back round every couple of years on the magazine because there'd be like a new reason to dip into the back catalogue or, you know, we'd be covering the virtual console on the you know, when it came to the Wii U, or we'd be redoing the directory when we redesigned the magazines, we'd go in and and tackle all this stuff again. So just over the course of doing Nintendo Mags for, you know, eight years. it it just sort of gradually kind of chips away at at the kind of canon. Um so it's sort I s I feel like I've got a pretty a pretty good grasp of it.

Samuel
19:29
I think that's a pretty good way to to have experienced that to to sort of have that crash course there. I remember there was some reason that on Play magazine. I had to play jumping flash and I was like, this is just this is purest ass and and sort of like I don't think anyone even would pretend jumping flash is good. I think it's more just uh well before Crash Bandicoot came out this did exist, so um it is a bit of PlayStation iconography that we have to acknowledge and I sort of Normally subscribe to the idea that with retro hardware the cream rises to the crop and then the most interesting th stuff you can play is the next tier of games down from the really obvious things where they pop up it commonly in best of lists, but they are not necessarily the very best games of the platform. Um and so I think that's um and that's kind of what I that's what I found the most interesting about doing the research for this episode, is that there's like probably five to ten games that fit that description where I was like, that is that was a pretty cool thing to check out or discover for the first time. And I completely agree that that rewind function is is absolute magic. And um you know, and I don't e it doesn't even I don't even think of it as cheating because I feel like the games are so quite often so bad for wasting your time with little animations you have to watch after you die where I'm like, come on, come on man, just cut this out. Like I'm 37 years old and I'm making I'm making a podcast this evening. Please spare me this fucking prolonged death animation and reload. Um yeah, so uh I I think that um so my experience with the Nerds is very actual first hand. I think I've only ever played Super Mario Bros on the platform. It's the first game I ever played. Not even totally sure that I played it, but I definitely remember seeing it when I was four or five at uh this girl's house. And she was the only person I ever met who owned an S. Um, I didn't know I didn't really know many people who owned Nintendo home consoles until The N64, really. Um I knew one guy who had a SNES. And yeah, this girl who had a NES. But um oh no, my friend Reese across the road had a NES actually as well. But um We didn't play it very often for some reason. He was a bit funny about it. I don't know why. Um so yeah, it uh and so I didn't really um yeah, I didn't ha I didn't have like a huge amount of knowledge of it. And when the virtual console came along I think I I bought a couple of things that were on there. I bought Mario Bruce 3 and God, maybe that was the only NES game I bought on there actually. Um but it was funny going through this it triggered some memory. At some point I played Kid I must have played Kid Ocarus the original because I ru I recognized the level layout and thought I've definitely played this. So That was was that in the 3DS batch of Nez games, Matthew? I think it Oh they gave the waiting there was a there was like a 3D classics version of it I don't know if that happened, but I I definitely played I've definitely played it at some point somewhere. Not sure where. Um and Uh Sightbike is definitely a game I've played the 3D classics version of and um it that looked fucking amazing at the time as well. What a great That was a great way to experience some of these games actually. The um I don't know how many of those did they do in the end? Because it seemed like they were a pretty good idea for the for for using the hardware. Oh there's only about like w I don't but was it even ten? Wow, it's like it's probably the best use case for the three DS is, you know, just chopping up these these like sprites and putting them on different layers, you know.

Matthew
22:58
It's definitely the cleanest version of Kirby's adventure you can play in terms of you know, not being choppy and basically shitting its pants the second like anything happens, which does happen with a few of these games. Some of these games the technical issues are so wild like you know two enemies come on screen and the music slows down. That's absolutely brilliant. That probably made me laugh. There's a dodgeball game on here made by the people who made River City Ransom in that in that kind of chibi style, the the sort of shared characters universe across those games. Where at the start of the game It's all flickering and the frame rates like absolutely fucked because there's like ten players. But because you're playing dodgeball and you're knocking players out the frame rate begins gets better and better the more people get knocked out of the game. I was like, that is just that's such a mad design flaw that you actually just have to play the game. It's like, don't worry, this will this will stabilize once you've taking out a couple of the weak links on the other team.

Samuel
23:58
I had that too when in Kid Icarus you got to the bit where the Grim Reaper goes mental and starts calling in his little lads. And that's when it grinds to a halt. When there's two Grim Reapers on screen, I'm like, no! It's like this game, this is now totally fucked as an experience. Um yeah, that is funny actually, just encountering quite obvious technical issues in some of these games. Um that's a bummer to hear that there's a g a great version of Kirby's adventure that I've not played actually.

Matthew
24:22
I hate I hate knowing that actually that's that's knowledge that's gonna slowly uh Don't worry, you can get it off the 3DS store. Oh oh dear. If only we did an episode telling people what to buy before that store closed.

Samuel
24:38
Did we do that? I think we did that. We did do that, but it's before we launched the Patreons. I I didn't have as much money then, you know, so that's Yeah. I had no disposable income because I still recently moved back from Brighton, which cost a fucking fortune Um anyway. Can't wave Brighton cost you a working version of Kirby's adventure. Well hey, I got all the uh fucking Guildo one um and guildo two games offer there, Matthew. That's the important thing. Um so yes, it I did um have a bit of experience with uh you know a couple of these games from various retro things Nintendo's put out over the years, but not like a consistent or deep one. I was actually quite surprised. uh how deep the kind of catalogue was in on the Switch online service to the point where I found it daunting to try and get through them all for this episode. Um Partly because I d you know, the they most of the games have more to offer than Atari fifty does. Atari fifty it's like what is this game? Oh it's this, turn it off. Like uh do you know no words do more heavy lifting when you're researching for this episode. episode then I get the idea. And then like holding down the triggers and going to close game basically. So yeah. Um I was wondering what you thought of the selection, Matthew. And um what do you think about How Nintendo packages them up on Switch Online?

Matthew
25:55
The selection's pretty good. Like there's, you know, genre wise is a nice mix of things. I'd say there are some quite glaring holes in it. Uh you know, there's you know things you definitely associate with and there's, you know, Castlevania, Mega Man completely missing. Basically it feels like anything which may have financial value to those companies elsewhere isn't on here. Like Can we get another squeeze of these Castlevania games in some kind of retro collection? Probably. So let's not put 'em in. But Like the Nintendo library, that's that's pretty comprehensive, and you do get some like interesting stuff, you know, around the edges. You get some like beat-em-ups, you get quite a lot of 2D character action games. uh you get some shoot 'em ups, um you know, th I I'd say you you know you get a kind of nice nice taste of things. Um and then there's this like I'd say like layer of like ten Why are these here games, which like they're companies which have been defunct for so long, you think, who even owns the rights to these to let them put them on the service? Like why did they bother? Um there's a game on there called Nightshade. I don't know if you played that.

Samuel
27:07
Don't think I got to that one unfortunately.

Matthew
27:09
Oh my god, I'd never heard of it. It's like a point and click adventure game made by an Australian team where you play it kind of visually it almost has like a little bit of like comic zone about it. Like it's it's quite it's quite like sort of beautiful in its its own eight bit way, um, but mixes together Yeah, like point and click puzzling, but also the you know, you're moving the character around i on the D-pad in real time and that can solve puzzles and battles are like their own kind of like quick time event thing going on. It's really, really strange. I'd I've only ever heard of it within this service. Um one of those kind of games of like, well I wonder how this happened, but you know, collection-wise, I think if you played everything here, you'll have seen like the absolute mainstream big hitters, but you'll also have seen some like quirky affair, that stuff you were talking about, like sort of ben beneath the layer of the the very best. Um, I think it's a pretty pretty good collection, you know, if not for those slightly uh you know glaring emissions, but I I think they're quite obvious and you know they probably are available elsewhere. Um in terms of actually how they're presented, like Each game has like a page of text that kind of explains the the sort of narrative setup for it, like a little sort of synopsis of the game. Some of them I mean a lot of them don't really have like instruction manuals as such. Um so like you have to sort of figure them out and work out how they work. It's quite weird playing these games. uh after having played uh UFI fifty, you know, which part of that game was about like figuring out like what what the hell you were looking at and what the thing actually did. And Uh there's quite a bit of that process here as well, unless there are instruction manuals that I just couldn't find anywhere. I don't think there are. Um I don't think so. No, okay. Good, that would have been embarrassing. Um so a lot of yeah, just pressing lots of different buttons trying to work it out. I mean that's extra confusing and there's there's a selection of uh Famicon only games so not not translated into English in their original Jap Japanese which is you know cool to have and it's only like four or five and You know, a couple of things that you might recognise from sort of trophies or power-ups in Smash Bros. seems to have have maybe been the sort of guiding light on what did and didn't make this collection. Um but those games, yeah, you really have to like figure out just what on earth's going on. Um so you know, quite hands-off as a bit of curation. Uh but for there's one sort of notable exception to this, which is that throughout the collection there are these sort of special edition of certain games, I think they call 'em like SP versions, which are like slightly remixed or give you a very particular scenario in the game. So, you know, i there's Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link. you know, as it was in the original, but then there's also an SP version of that separate to it, which if you go into um It's playing the game but Link's like fully leveled up, has all the spells unlocked, all the powers, and can basically go on like a rampage from the start. And it feels like it th they've made i these sort of riffs on games which are, I don't know, designed to make you I I don't know. I th I don't know if they're meant to be like shortcuts to what these games can be or you know, some of them are like extra difficult modes of certain like already notoriously hard games and that shows like a bit of thought. Like that isn't anywhere else in this collection. Um, but it does seem quite random how they've selected those games and you know, who's actually gone in and made these Sl slightly odd modes.

Samuel
31:06
Yeah. One of them, for example, is I think that the final boss of Ninja Gaiden is the SP version for that. So you just jump in and play the very last bit of the game. Which I don't know who would want to do that really, because then you kind of miss out on the entire arc of learning what it is or whatever, but maybe there's some

Matthew
31:26
I don't understand the motivation of these characters at all.

Samuel
31:31
Yeah, maybe there's some techmo coe reason. Maybe they were like, oh, if you want anyone to see like one moment from this game, it has to be X. But you're right, it's They don't all follow that kind of pattern. Sometimes they're like easy versions of the game and sometimes they're just, yeah, like a kind of cust just custom difficulty settings. It's quite a quite strange phenomenon. I it has the hallmarks of something where It's a value add for a service, but not like a product they're selling. And so it existing as this pool of stuff as like part of a subscription. I kind of get it's not like when you go on Netflix, they say Oh, by the way, have you heard of The Godfather? Cause here's what here's the deal. You know what I mean? Like it's not like they present everything on a big timeline. So I can see why Nintendo hasn't seen this as like you know, we've got to explain what every single one of these things is in real detail. Um that I said when you do hit the details button, I would say that the context you get is a bit slightly too back of the box and would it just would benefit from like one paragraph, I think, of saying, hey, here's why this is here, or hey, here's why this is interesting, or some kind of trivia like that. Because Yeah. When Nintendo wants to, I think it will do that kind of like forensic, you know, um not g not really in the Atari 50 style, but Smash Bros is a celebration of its history. They're aware of it, you know. Um Yeah.

Matthew
32:53
Yeah, th the s Smash Brothers is so specifically the creation of Masahiro Sakurai, who is like an Uber nerd about this stuff. Yeah. And I think once once that's been known, like his fingerprints are all over it, I think Nintendo left their own devices are not so much like hands off, but like their museum, for example, the Nintendo Museum that they opened in Kyoto that, you know, you can fly halfway round the world and and try and get a raffle for a ticket or however it is you get in. You know, Catherine went to it for for Eurogamer and said Everything was there, but like none of it's explained, you know? There's like no information anywhere. It's just cabinets and after cabinets of like everything they've ever done. And they're just kind of, huh, look at this. And I don't think it's like l laziness. I just you know, they just don't want to curate it. They don't want to kind of imprint any like message or reading on anything. They just want it to be completely just your raw reaction to a thing. But I don't know if, you know, that's entirely satisfying. That's what's stopping me flying halfway round the world to go to that museum, because I don't want to just see a hundred NES controllers presented without context. Yeah. And that which is kind of what this game collection is, just like, yeah, some games.

Samuel
34:15
You know Yeah. It's j it's funny, when it comes to their own history, I think they're they're purely They're purely interested in aesthetics and not the actual human psychology behind anything, you know? And that's how as a company their a relationship with nostalgia operates. So And they're they're opportunistic about nostalgia as well. They're like, it's, you know, when it's time to bring back a certain game, it's, you know, Paper Mary, the thousand year door, here it is. But There's no effort made to sort of say, oh, here's why Thousand Year Door is considered like the most ignor game of this of this era. In fact, it feels like they do even less of that stuff than they did maybe in the Wii U days where, you know, when the Wind Wake HD edition came out, I mentioned this, obviously, but the we did a games TM cover and, you know, interviewed A and Uma about the game and stuff like that. And That was perhaps because Nintendo had to work a little bit harder to sell the things that it it had made in that moment, but now doesn't have to, um, because it's on top again. Um yeah, so it's it's just yeah, there's no real consistency with how they approach this stuff and Um yeah, it's i I I don't resent it as a pile of games, but certainly um it does mean that you'll sometimes play something where you're like, what the hell is this? And then You turn it off. And I wonder if that is the experience of 99% of the people who play this stuff. And I'm not saying that Atari 50's like one paragraph explainers made the games any better. But you did at least understand why it existed, you know, or who who made it, you know?

Matthew
35:43
Yeah, or it would say like this did particularly well, or it's notable because the person who did this went on to do this, or you know, here's a piece of trivia. I'm You know, what's especially frustrating about Nintendo's reluctance to offer those stories is that compared to, you know, a lot of companies A lot of the staff who made these games are still there or are still closely tied with Nintendo. You know, they are they're kind of lifers. It's very, very rare that anyone leaves and starts talking. And Yeah, because of that, like they're actually in quite a rare position to tell that story themselves firsthand. Like they'd have full editorial control over it. You know, it's i I I keep comparing it in my head to whenever people try and do like Final Fantasy retro uh spectives That series is such a nightmare of like clashing personalities now over the years that it's like next to impossible to like fully tell that story. in in any kind of comprehensive way where Nintendo like they don't really have any of that. They're all still there. Everyone who made these games are just there but they're now like seventy-five or whatever. And you can go to them and just ask them, say like, tell me one thing about fucking baseball on the NES. Like th I just want one factoid for this little box and it'll make this thing like a thousand times more interesting than it currently is. you know, rather than sitting on all that knowledge until those people start dying, which is, you know, unfortunately gonna probably start happening soon.

Samuel
37:13
Yeah, it's true. I mean a waterass was a great sort of thing in a bottle. I mean that's That was him doing that work, wasn't it? That was him that felt like his personal interest in the history of the company and the people, you know?

Matthew
37:26
But like most of what we know about their design philosophies come from th those interviews. Like they're s they're such an amazing resource. Like we're so lucky to have those. Uh you know, I still go back to now, I'm like, these are just like better than any interviews these teams did with anyone external. And I know it's still like a promotional kind of puff piece and it's all marketing, but yeah, they truly were like an amazing, amazing thing we had. you know, and and maybe you just needed to have a, you know, a slight outsider like Hawato, who obviously you know came into Nintendo to to kind of be able to sort of tell that story and and and ask those questions and you know, now it's sort of back in the hands of the people who've always been there and yeah, I don't know. It's not it's not quite the same thing.

Samuel
38:10
Okay, well uh I guess moving on then to the actual games themselves, Matthew. The the overall sweep of them. With Atari fifty I think you like me were were sort of like most of these are bad and but but I think we respected No Did you really not respect any of the I mean they were like fucking early pioneers that's so sniffy that is. That's so fucking sniffy. Imagine like you've never no one's ever done this stuff ever at home. I know.

Matthew
38:41
Like, I d I genuinely a lot of those games when I played them, I I know I said this in the episode, but I I really did think I'm kind of amazed people went for this as like a thing, as like a medium. I'm like surprised people thought, oh yeah, this is good. Because they were just so abstract and miserable. I mean the leap from that to the NES games, like Playing Atari 50 has actually it has recontextualized the NES library because when I was playing through these today, things which I know to be not great NES games in the grand scheme of things, I was still like This is so much better than what was going on elsewhere, you know? Like this is just technically so excellent and so interesting and so kind of complete an idea They just were making better games. Uh uh I don't think that's sniffiness.

Samuel
39:32
Um Well no, I mean I'm not saying it's more the thing about not r s even respecting the attempts.

Matthew
39:37
No, I I obviously You know.

Samuel
39:39
But I I get what you mean. Like I I th I think the thing it it is true that playing Atari 50 is kind of the best context you can have for playing these games because They move things on so much and when you think about the comparative time difference, the thing that I just couldn't get over was that only four years separate Yars Revenge and Gradius. Like and they might that might as well be like a hundred years. Um that's you know uh that's relatively speaking, that's 2021, right? So, you know, that's what came out that did Ragnarok come out that year? What came out in twenty twenty one? I can't really remember. Horizon two, for example. Like it's yeah, it would it feels like yesterday basically. So the idea of things moving that quickly is kinda crazy. Um so yeah, I definitely think that's that's sp spotlighted by this. And yeah, I will admit there were moments where I playing Ice Climber, a game I do not think is very good, but I was there also thinking Atari would have fucking killed for this, you know what I mean?

Matthew
40:37
Right, that's that's that's exactly the point I was making. Like th i even at its lowest moment I was like this is like this would have melted the face of someone who'd just been playing Fucking uh what's that the one I keep coming Warlords uh four player medieval pong Warlords Oh dear I play so many fucking versions of Warlords um yeah

Samuel
41:03
Jesus Christ. Yeah. Um Yeah, so I do think that it's uh yeah, like it's a the grab bag approach means it's some there's some wild ups and downs here, but In general, you know, uh the the things that sort of rise to the top are all pretty impressive, you know, and we're not unlike Atari where we were dealing with like um uh you know, a wild stab in the dark each time they made a game. Here it they just they do just feel like the first step towards what games are now, you know? It's And so many of them happen so quickly. It's cut it's it's really impressive. So yeah. Um what were the highlights of what you played, Matthew? Maybe a top five if you have one.

Matthew
41:42
Uh oh I've got um I'm looking so I split I made a bigger list of everything which I split into good games that had something about them things which were just bang average uh and things that were bad. Just take me through the whole list. I want it I want to hear it. Oh well it's it's it's like 70 games long. That's why it's hugely complicated. So good games I mean I've got more than five, but if I was to pick the cream of the crop, the problem is I didn't want to just fill it with the obvious, you know, Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3. Obviously you know, amazing. Super Mario Bros. 3 particularly, like you say, is just you know so much more sort of complicated and advanced than Super Mario Bros. But they're, you know, both you know, still really great platformers. I was just trying to pick out some things which were well, I don't I wanna even say they were kind of like bubbling under. They're still really well known. But um Let's say let's start with punch out. Yeah, okay, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Which I still think is like absolutely one of a kind. Kind of perfectly formed Like to the point that when they made Punch Elm Wii, all it really was was a graphical overhaul of the exact framework established in this SNES game. You know, as a result, you're like, well, it feels like it did all the mechanical lifting, it did all the thinking it needed to do, you know, which is not necessarily trying to sort of simulate boxing. But presenting it as almost like an arcade puzzle to be solved where each contestant had like certain behaviors. And the idea is that by t you know, timing your punches and dodging certain moves, you can open them up for like a real walloping and it's it's almost about sort of unpicking them and working out like what the shortcuts are to defeating each fighter. Um which is quite a kind of cold video gamey way. Like it's I wouldn't say it's a boxing simulation in any way, shape or form. But it is quite an interesting way about thinking about boxing and even just the perspective like behind the guy's back and you controlling like you know, his two fists and the ducking, the weaving with the body, you know, with a very limited number of buttons on the control pad, I think it really understood kind of how to put you in little Mac's body. And I don't know, it just really jumped out as being like, yeah, that's just That's just a great little thing.

Samuel
44:07
Yeah, I th I I love that as well. Um it's funny because I approached this exercise slightly differently. I I made like a top five of games that I had never played before in any form. And um and that was sort of my that was my approach to it. And so Okay. Well I can I think I can do that on the fly as well for a more interesting chat. Well no, I mean I I think I I agreed though. I played Punch Out and I I was like, oh yeah, this is, you know, incredibly um impressive and self-contained and does everything you want it to do and super responsive. I actually found that responsiveness and like the the speed the feeling of speed to the game was a big part of like why I would enjoy something or not. Yeah. You know, if something was super slow or you noticed the frame rate issues really they were really pronounced. That really kind of did my head in a a little bit. So um yeah, I think um if I had a a sort of top five of things where I I guess I have Nintendo familiarity to them, I think Punch Out would probably be Probably be in there.

Matthew
45:04
Okay, I'm trying to pick things now that I haven't.

Samuel
45:06
Well no, no, no, by all means carry on with the um the good games you've got. I think that's a better way of doing it for the time being. I'll read out my top five at the end.

Matthew
45:13
Uh Star Tropics, I really like. It's a bit zeldery. My hot Star Tropics take. I think this is a lot of people's hot Star Tropics take. is that if you want a Zelda on Nez, this is actually probably the one rather than Legend of Zelda, which I don't know if it does hold up. Or I think it's I think the original Zelda is like an important game rather than one that I I get any great pleasure playing now. I fucking agree. I fucking agree, Matthew. Okay, well that's good. Yeah, it's just it's just a little bit too stripped back I think and we've played amazing 2D Zelda from that perspective uh you know afterwards and I think that has like broken it a little bit. So You know, if you are looking for something on NES, which I think like, you know, it holds up. I'm not gonna say it's it's there's anything which is like secretly, you know, linked to the past good on the NES. I don't think there is. But Star Tropics where you play as a He's something weird, like he's a baseball player for the wherever the the Seattle baseball team is. Seahawks. I don't know if it's the cross tie-in with with them, but you're on these tropical islands Uh you've got like a top down map screen, but when you go into dungeons it's presented more like Zelda. You've got a yo-yo instead of a sword. It's all a little bit kinda like off kilter. Uh all the characters you meet are c are quite strangely drawn, like you actually sort of See them it as sort of first person portraits, but they're quite detailed. And it is a game I I have played this one before, but I um Yeah, I always liked it. The only thing I didn't try out this famously when it came out on the NES had a a piece of paper that came in the game box. That at one point in the game you had to submerge in water to reveal a code. to use in the game because when I played this on Virtual Console, they'd added a thing like it's into an instruction manual which basically sort of replicated that puzzle where you had like a virtual piece of paper. that you dipped in water to discover a coat. And I I don't know how they do it in this version or if they've just kind of like sort of cut around that somehow. Um you know I didn't I didn't get that far into it. But um Yeah, Star Tropic's just a bit weird. Almost like that that uh that paper code thing has always struck me as being like almost like a kind of kajimery kind of maneuver um but yeah obviously yeah Nintendo doing their own thing um that one's good that one holds up did you play Blastermaster

Samuel
47:42
Yeah, I like Blastermaster. Um it's funny actually because that a few games playing this uh reminded me of UFO 50. And that has a game, UFO fifty has a game that must be inspired by Blastermaster. It's a game where you teleport a little tank around. Uh I kinda what's kinda what it's called now. But yeah, I thought Blastermaster it's kinda like a mix of Side-scrolling shooter but also Metroidvania in some ways. Like it's got a a map that goes off in different directions. And You can get out of the tank as well. Um it's quite yeah, it's it's it's quite an un it definitely feels distinctive among the games here.

Matthew
48:20
Yeah, it reminded me a bit or I I I think I wonder if it was an influence on those velocity games. It has like the vehicle sections, but when you get out as the little man and you go into places, you know, it becomes like a top-down game and you're suddenly shooting robots in like little top-down mazes and It like just to have almost like two genres based on whether or not you're in the vehicle. Like it's it's fine. I wouldn't say I was sitting there thinking, you know, my gods, this is this is a work of genius, but I don't know, to have games, you know, this relatively early on that are already like messing with sort of perspective and smashing together different genres, that stuff always feels you know, even now when that happens, I'm like This feels quite cutting edge.

Samuel
49:03
Yeah, I feel I f I feel the same way. I also like from this era where there was quite a lot of what if we do two or three completely different genres combined. I felt like Atari 50 had a bit of this as well. Um or like, you know, just a a bit of a ga a a gulf between yeah, like one one style of gameplay and another. So I like that about this while also, yeah, I think feeling the same way. I got to a few dead ends and I was like I don't think I love this, but I do admire it, you know.

Matthew
49:29
H here's a one I'd never played before, uh which I actually ended up playing like a a considerable chunk of. Thought it was alright. Fire and Ice. Oh I didn't play this one, unfortunately. Yeah, I mean the box art look absolutely terrible. Like it has some fire and some ice on it. Like it's it's like super literal. This is Solomon's Key 2. Solomon's Key One is also in the collection. A I would say not particularly great puzzle game about magicking blocks in and out of existence. This is quite similar, you're like a little wizard in a 2D maze. And uh but all the puzzles were all around uh extinguishing fire with ice blocks by pushing ice into fire or using that same wand to like almost like remove the structural supports from ice blocks so that they fall onto flames and it's all about, you know, self-contained, you know, one by one puzzle boxes of how how do you kind of combine everything here and not massively complicated well quite complicated from a puzzling perspective I was rubbish at this but um yeah quite a simple idea one of those ones where I thought oh this could be like a modern indie game, you know, this could be like one of those sort of Stephen Sausage roll type games, you know, it has that sort of Absolute like minimalist, this is just ice and fire, everything behaves in a very fixed way and like how can we kind of riff on this? um, you know, those sort of soccer ban sort of p crate pushing sort of games. Um yeah, it felt like a yeah, pretty decent version of those, but, you know, some twenty five years ago or thirty years ago. I feel like I've fucked it by not called animations on the wizard. Like when he fell, like his cloak would sort of you know flutter in the wind and stuff.

Samuel
51:15
Just little touches I thought, oh, that's quite good. Yeah, I mean I feel like I fucked it out by not playing the bottom three rows, which probably had all the best games, as opposed to like the top three top eleven rows, which had like all of the dog shit. That's probably the The but the terrible maths that I made here.

Matthew
51:30
Um yeah, that's a bummer. No, I've got this gotta be stuff I mean super basic bitch. Uh but Ninja Gaiden, that is a good game.

Samuel
51:39
I didn't like it that much, to be honest. I thought I thought the platforming was way too fiddly. Like it's having to jump onto like things and then jump between different surfaces. I just found that fiddly as all fuck.

Matthew
51:52
The combat like the OG wall jump.

Samuel
51:55
Yeah, but it's just so stiff, isn't it? I couldn't It didn't feel very dependable as a as a uh as a thing to actually you I that's what I thought playing it. I just thought he's getting fucking stuck here, then when I try and flip up onto this surface, I feel like he should land on that surface, but he's not, and he's kind of going back down to the ground and I just it feels like he should be jumping a bit higher than he does when he does the the wall jump between the different walls. I Yeah, I I can't say I I thought that you know the actual hack and slash bit of the game was a lot better than Rhygar, which is another techmo game from this time. Uh a game I did not think was very good um out of this collection. But I can see why maybe it's just that's just the that's just the passage of time though, right?

Matthew
52:40
I think so. I I just like it. I like that there are things which sort of try and depic slightly more adult worlds on the NES. You know, it like w what I like about it is seeing like grimy urban streets sort of rendered at i you know in eight bit style or like the first boss is like a bar and there's just a bar with all these little bottles on it and I think it's it's just sort of fun trying to see you know, people take a swing at you know, rendering these real life things into into video game form because you know, up until this point i so much stuff is is like abstracted to to make it work in a game, you know, or it's child friendly or slightly fantastical. So I I've actually got a real soft spot. I've got a soft spot for Ninja Gaiden, but also I'd say the less good versions of the N there are lots of other 2D sort of action games like Ninja Gaiden in the in this collection of Nez games. And all of them I sort of thought I I I kinda like this aesthetic, you know, I like this action movie thriller thing, kind of, you know, how these games look, how they sound. So uh you know, along with this I'm grouping things like Vice Project Doom Oh yeah. Which also had car driving sections and like a and like a first person turret section. I thought that one was pretty good actually. I thought that was almost like As good as Ninja Gaiden. There was Shadow of the Ninja, which is just a not as good Ninja Gaiden with a soundtrack that absolutely rips off Castlevania. There was one called Journey to Silius. Oh yeah. About a boy with lots of different guns shooting robots, which apparently was a Terminator game at some point, and then Sunsoft like lost the license. That's incredible. Yeah, I mean he doesn't look like um he doesn't look like I I mean it's sort of set in the future bit a world where robots control everything, so I don't know who that would be in Terminator 1. Like, is m is Michael Bean running around the future ever?

Samuel
54:45
Yeah, he he looks like a very tiny Michael Bean. Um feasibly, you know? Yeah.

Matthew
54:49
But I I apparently that's a thing. Um also I mean Rygar is like the fantasy like version of this. Not very good though. That's a weird one. Rygar's got like some proper champions online. Some people think this is like a 10 out of 10 in this game.

Samuel
55:05
It's nowhere near as good as Ninja Gaiden, I don't think. It's found it very rough and repetitive, you know?

Matthew
55:11
Yeah, I think it does open up a bit as it goes on. I think it's like a little Like less linear than the other games, like you get to a hub town and then you can push into different bits of the map. I think it's got a bit of like Metroid y energy to it, but I must admit I didn't get that far with it. Um that one I had to do a lot of rewinding. The enemies just came so thick and fast. That's That's the problem with some of these action games. It's like you fight the imminent threat and then it just spawns everything like a second later. And The progress you make for the levels is so slow because you're stopping every three steps to kill the the you know the new batch of dogs that are coming after you. And then the three more steps and like there's another two dogs? My god. And you really get the idea that they'll throw as much as they can without like the game literally melting in the cartridge slot. Like the slowdown in Rygar, that's the one which the music literally changes like tempo when there's three enemies on screen.

Samuel
56:08
Uh normally there's like two turtles in the in the turtles.

Matthew
56:10
Yes, two turtles which will battery like what looks like a yo-yo. Did you play Scat? Uh I don't think I did play Scat. No. Cybernetic attack team, which is again very like, you know, one of these 2D action games except you're in a like a little flying robot sort of mech suit almost. Um so it's a lot more kind of like fast moving. You're flying around. It's almost like sort of halfway house between a uh you know, a contra and maybe like a like a shoot 'em up. Um it's got a bit more kind of like uh sort of move sort of fast movement and dodging around projectiles. Um That whole kind of tier of sub Ninja Gaiden games, I don't know, I had a pretty good time with those. That's like something where I think if you went into this service and just played you know, all of the games in it, you know, you probably haven't touched some of them and you probably would be a tiny bit taken with s some of the stuff I've described. Um you know, seeing like grubby warehouses and like battleships you know, in this 8-bit style. I think there's something quite cool about that.

Samuel
57:21
Well that those are definitely the games that I would have bought when I was like if I was a kid at this time, you know? So I definitely understand on that level, you know. Um yeah, it's it seems like there's a there's a big variety in critical reception to some of these games as well. Like um Just because I think of the na the nature of how Nintendo has has got them, but without really curating them. Like I don't think like um for example I looked at the reviews of SCAT just now. And that's got everything from like a three out of twelve in Germany, um, to like uh six sixty-nine percent from total. And um eighty five percent from NFOs, for example.

Matthew
57:59
So what's great about a lot of these games when you look on Wikipedia is They were being reviewed in an era of magazines where every magazine had its own batship scoring system. So like not all of them are out of a hundred. You know, there's kind of This this out of forty or like it got like three thumbs up from half of like the nerd squad and two thumbs down. You're like, what the fuck? Like imagine trying to be Metacritic back then and Just trying to make sense of what all these different scoring seems. What is a three out of twelve mean, you know?

Samuel
58:31
I I will uh I want to ask you this, because I I do like how you've grouped together all of those side scrolling games into to sort of one discussion there. I think that's I think that's pretty cool. I think out of the ones they did play, I would say that Ninja Gaiden is is probably the default best, even if I I was hoping it'd be slightly better than it was, and then Blaster Master would probably be my second out of those. Um but I I did um want to ask what you made of side-scrolling beat-em-ups in this, because there's a fair few of them and I have I have a really specific take on what it's like to play those games now, but I want to hear what you think of them before we before I weigh in. Ah did any get into your good tier? Yeah, River City Ransom. Yes, that's in one of my top five, so Yeah.

Matthew
59:18
Uh really good. But I yeah, I I've written about that a few times in Endgamer, because that was one I remember playing, you know. discovering back then and going, Oh actually this is this is pretty good compared to a lot of these things. I think it's so much better than Double Dragon which I'm Rubbish. Yeah, it is ro is rubbish, Double Dragon. Yeah.

Samuel
59:36
Yeah. Um the problem I had with it is that this is a genre that on SNES and Mega Drive is absolutely lights out. There's some amazing games. And so something like Double Dragon has so little value to me. That's how I felt about most of these games. But River City Ransom was a an exception to that. Sorry, I cut you off there, Matt.

Matthew
59:53
Yeah, no, no, I dunno, that's that's that's I mean pretty much where I land on these. But I I do think River City Ransom does get you know the fundamental basics right of like you know punching a person, their reaction, the feel of the punch, that's all pretty good. It's nice and reactive, it's quite snappy. Um it's got quite a lot of like idiosyncratic touches to it. Like There's like a almost like a running commentary along the bottom of the screen of what the enemies are saying when you hit them. A lot of them say buff. Um And but you know, presumably are being sick 'cause you've just punched them so hard. Um that's quite like evocative. Uh and it has like some like RPG elements. It's not just a straightforward walk down this street and beat up a big boss like there are different regions to the town and you can kind of explore and go in and out of them and it just has a sort of a slightly better sense of place despite having this you know, quite kind of cartoonish, sort of chibi art style, these little big headed guys. Um I think that's that's pretty good. I mean this genre is like particularly tough to play this weekend 'cause I've been playing that Absalom with Catherine. Oh yeah yeah which is absolutely amazing. Like that is a brilliant brilliant game like modern beat 'em up and it's just It's so cutting edge and the combo system and the the way that you can just string everything together, it just it feels Unbelievably good. So like going from that to the already not excellent Double Dragon original is is like it's a tough break for Double Dragon, but um you know, probably a good advert for River City Ransom. Like I didn't think it was abysmal despite being in this kind of like Absalom loving

Samuel
01:01:36
Yeah, I think it's the character of River City Ransom that helps it stand out as well as being I think you're right, like there's there are definitely some games where you have to punch and kick on on this service that where that feels like they're never connecting or it feels really yeah like it just or it's just not very fun to do so. Um So yeah, it's i it it was by far the best one I played out of that bunch for sure.

Matthew
01:01:59
Uh a similar question then about the to the beat-em-ups. Did you play any of the shoot 'em ups? Uh yes, I did. I'm curious what what you th like if if you feel like beat em ups has been s sort of surpassed by what came later in beat 'em ups Do this original batch of shooting ups hold any treats for you?

Samuel
01:02:17
I thought they were a bit better than the the beat maps. Um it's you've got um Xevious or Zevius, I don't know how you pronounce that on here.

Matthew
01:02:24
I've always said Zevius, but

Samuel
01:02:26
I I will admit I I thought that was a few steps down from the absolute king shit of this genre, which is Gradius, which is fucking amazing, even now, I think. Um and again really benefits from that rewind um function, but just has like the I think visually just does enough, audio just does enough, it moves really, really smoothly. And I thought that one really stood out. Then there's this Twin Bee as well, right? Um I like Twin Bee. I think Twin Bee was pretty solid. Um Twinbee comes before Gradius in the um the timeline. So Right. I don't know, uh but I assume that Gradius was an arcade game first and uh basically I'm just trying to work out how how something like that came before The Gradius on Nez, but again, you if you've got no context here, you basically are you're without a paddle. Um but yeah, I quite liked I quite like Twin B. And then there were probably more, but I'm not remembering them. Um there was uh There was s soldier uh star soldier. Too hard that one. I thought that was incredibly fucking challenging. What did you make of that one? The rewind feature got me through. God bless that. Um But Gladius you can kind of play without the rewind. That's the thing. It's it's a bit more generous, I think, difficulty-wise.

Matthew
01:03:39
At least at first.

Samuel
01:03:40
Yeah, I yeah, I'd agree with that.

Matthew
01:03:41
But I did like Twin B. What I liked about both um, Twin B and Gradius is that they've both got a you have some agency over how you upgrade the ship. Um you know, like in Gradius, the different power-ups are They're almost like f they're filling up an upgrade bar which you can then sort of cash in on and then have the thing which is reach. So like maybe you cash out early and you just get a speed boost or you wait until later and get a laser and that's quite exciting. In Twin B it's a bit more kind of cutesy but you're shooting these bells uh and the bells change colour when you shoot them and the colour that they are uh then decides the kind of power you're gonna get. So you're kinda trying to juggle the bell until you can get something good. Um but I yeah, I I I I like b both of those just had something extra going on beyond, you know, shoot this thing, dodge those bullets.

Samuel
01:04:33
Yeah, definitely. And like I say, if you If you play Yard's Revenge in 82 and then play Gradius in 86, that's your face melted. You know what I mean? That's like, I cannot believe this is in my house. That's how I would have felt if I was in North America at that time, you know.

Matthew
01:04:47
I also liked I mean this separate I think those are all the shoot 'em ups that I've got on my list. I think I think that's right, yeah. Did you play Joy Mech Fight? Uh did I actually. It was the one which like all the characters are like made out of sort of like collections of orbs.

Samuel
01:05:05
Unfortunately it looks like this came out in the nineties, so I just fucking missed out on it by the time.

Matthew
01:05:14
I definitely recognize the little pink robot guy from it. Like it it triggered something in the depths of my mind, like some fear in me that he that he would come and do something horrible. Um yeah. Sukapon, I I think uh is that right, is that his name? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Um I mean, I'm not gonna like pretend that I have any grasp of of the fighting scene, the 2D fighting scene, but like in my head, you know, it begins in earnest and you know at least becomes worth thinking about or talking about with like, you know, the 16 bit genre. Maybe that's horribly wrong, but I but that's that's how yeah. I mean That's my absolute like not involved in this genre take. But uh Can we talk about it? This I actually thought was alright. Like the It's maybe a little bit Smash Bros. adjacent in that the character movesets are a bit simpler, they've all got the sort of same button inputs, so like if you can fight with one character you can fight with any of them. they're all sort of made up of collections of floaty orbs rather than like one big connected sprite, which I think allows it to like move at quite a clip, like all the different bits of their body can like move separately and I thought it worked, you know. I I played a l I played against the you know, the computer a little bit and thought, oh, this feels quite snappy. It looks quite nice, like it could almost be an early SNES game. It had that slight kind of Kirby thing of just being like a cut above. But I mean are they playing Joy McFighter Evo? I don't know.

Samuel
01:06:53
Well that's the that's the world thing, right? You are you are correct to point out that this looks a lot better than most of the games from the time, but It comes out like so much later than all other s Nez games. Like it's a nineteen ninety-three game. Right. So That's three uh in j and Japan only. That's three years after Super Mario World on SNES. So it kind of tracks that it would look a touch nicer, you know, or they they there's a lot they could do with the hardware at that point.

Matthew
01:07:20
So yeah. But it just it just but it also wor well, you know, like Kirby's adventure looks like way nicer than any other Nez game, but it also like kills the Nez to play it.

Samuel
01:07:32
Yeah. Yeah, it's true. Um there it's that's that is a a funny quirk of it. God damn it, I wish I'd I'd started at the very like future of the hardware work backwards. You've picked so many games by chance that happen to be like late

Matthew
01:07:59
For years I've thought Urban Champion was like absolute shit on the NES. Like I remember playing that back on Endgamer and thinking What is even going on with this? And playing it now, it only just dawned on me that it's basically Nidhog. Like thirty years before Nidhogg in that it's a kind of a tug of war fighting game where you're trying to push a person back several screens so they fall into a hole but they can push you all the way back from their final screen all the way back to the left. to fall into your hole and that kind of constant to and fro. I mean the game itself is pretty simple and pretty basic. But uh I don't know the the core idea of like over several screens you have to you have to just knock someone back. I thought that was I don't know, it had something going to it.

Samuel
01:08:48
That's that's one where I thought this isn't totally terrible, you know I will confess that in a Google Doc right now I have the words urban champion-shite written down in a document. Okay, yeah, that's fair enough. But well, no, but let me just weigh in and say You are right that the structure of it is quite novel because you beat this it's two identical looking guys apart from one's a different colour to the other one. I think one's green and one's blue. They beat each other up and in front of various shops and the only distinguishing feature of the shop is a sign that says snack store or like they convenience store or th things like that. And then at the end of the round, um the guy the other guy gets punched down a hole and that's the that's the end of it. And that's the version their version of the worm, I guess, a Nid Hulk Matthew. Yes. Um so yes, very good. I I mean The thing is, I think it it it was like playing it was like someone had the design document for Punch Out but made a totally different version of it, you know what I mean? Because it's so sort of like it is almost like a Rock, paper, scissors sort of combat system. It's not really a complex one-on-one beat-em-up. It's sort of like did you do the right move at the right time kind of thing?

Matthew
01:09:54
There is there is something interesting about you know, thinking about Nintendo in the mid-80s, going, well, we think fighting, two men fighting is going to be like a thing in games that people more people are gonna want to see And other people are maybe doing it and we should have our own version of it and like what's our way of doing this? And you know, they don't want to end it with someone broken and bad on the floor. Like it ends in It's kind of a quite a harmless way, like a comedy pratfall down a manhole cover. Like if every Street Fighter fight ended with someone falling down a manhole I just don't think that game would have the same kind of cultural reach it has. But I like that that's their idea of like, well we've got to do this, but we don't want it to be upsetting. What's the solution? And then what about the aim is we push them towards a hole slowly. Like in all good fights.

Samuel
01:10:48
The other f nice touch about uh this game is that There's a point where the police comes along, so they both stop fighting temporarily and just sort of hide out of sight. That's like a nice bit of personality. Yeah, and then back to fighting in front of the snack store, as uh as two men often do, Matthew. Um I would love to know uh so I None of the rare games got into your good bracket, did they?

Matthew
01:11:14
In my had something about them bracket. Right. Um, I did include sh uh solar jetman.

Samuel
01:11:21
Oh yeah, yeah. This definitely definitely impressive in some ways.

Matthew
01:11:24
Yeah, like the little ship graphics. It looks kind of s it's like fake 3D, isn't it? The way the little the little sprite r moves around feels quite liquidy and Uh you're basically flying around a load of subterranean tunnels picking up uh parts of um a thing that you're building by taking it back to your base. Uh and it's kind of about Sort of fighting enemies, shooting enemies who are trying to get in your way, but also battling the the sort of physics of the spaceship and your fuel counter. Um they did a They did like a redo of this, or like a remake of this uh on um Xbox Live Arcade that was in rare replay that I played loads of.

Samuel
01:12:05
Back refueled, was that right what it was called?

Matthew
01:12:07
Yeah, that's right.

Samuel
01:12:08
Yeah.

Matthew
01:12:08
Yeah.

Samuel
01:12:09
Yeah that's a pretty cool game if I recall.

Matthew
01:12:11
Yeah, so uh you know, I uh when I was playing this I was just constantly thinking of that version which I which I quite liked. So, yeah, I mean I'd say all the rare games that are here are technically quite excellent. And That's very fully formed ideas, you know. They are they are kind of cut above. I wouldn't say any of them I'm, you know, particularly sort of in love with. Snake Rattle and Rolls, another one. Which is sort of fine. Catherine I think had this as a child and was really into it and was getting cross that I didn't seem to appreciate it as much as she did. Where you feed a snake apples to make its tail grow.

Samuel
01:12:48
What about um RC Prior, Matthew? Uh yeah.

Matthew
01:12:54
Yeah. I'm not crazy about the isometric racing games on the NES. But there was that one and there were a couple of like speedboat games. And all of them th they felt like oh a couple of years later micro machines will kinda make this like a bit more kind of playable and fun.

Samuel
01:13:15
Yeah, I can see that. I I think it's that I did actually quite like the the rare games on here generally. I think that Um I think that the um with uh Solar Jet Man, that would have been way better if the if the screen could show more than it does. But because you are just you are always like going very quickly towards a surface um that you don't know is coming out of nowhere because you've got no real visibility of where things are due to you know, technical restraints. But if you had like I don't know one point five times the information in terms of, you know, things coming around you, then I think it would I think that would help. Um but I will confess to thinking that RC Promo is actually a pretty good game. Even with the knowledge that this is a genre that's got a long way to go. Um, that was actually like number two in my top five of games that I hadn't previously played because I do know that people made a big deal about about this. Is it the is this the one that people really liked or did it was it the one on the snares that people liked? Um because I know it's got a bit of a It's definitely one that came. I remember Simon Miller used to used to like RC Prim and talk about it. But it's actually got it's pretty good as a You sort of have just have to memorize where all the power-ups are as you're going around the track and where all the boosts are. And then it just becomes every lap just becomes this kind of memory test basically. And so it's not really a competitive racing game in i in some ways you're not really competing with the other races. You've j you are just trying to memorize where everything is. So you've got all the advantages you need to qualify for the next race because it's all about basically don't finish last because otherwise you'll be you'll be out um and you are like upgrading your vehicle as you as you go. And I quite like the way it just uses power-ups, but it's also a very technically accomplished considering some of the fast moving games on NES that have like those performance issues. This just runs really, really well. Um I'm assuming this is faithful to how it originally ran. So I was quite into RC Prair, Matthew. Um yeah, I thought it was good. I I I also didn't mind Cobra Triangle, the boat one.

Matthew
01:15:19
I thought it was alright.

Samuel
01:15:21
You didn't like that one as much?

Matthew
01:15:22
No. There was Cobra Triangle and there was another one which had a oh it was like Eliminator Boat Jewel Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I think it was eliminate a boat jewel that had at the start y we when you're on the starting line, if you if you jet off early before they've said go It fines you like £2,000 and it just comes up in giant words. Find £2,000 every time it happens. Uh it was quite it was quite stylishly done actually, but also very annoying.

Samuel
01:15:59
Which is just like the that's like a all time backpage coded uh kind of like game over screen, I feel. Um that's good. What what else is in your your second tier down, Matthew? Oh, Dig Dug Two Yeah, I quite like Dig Doug too as well.

Matthew
01:16:14
Yeah, I what what made me laugh about this was I like I've always known Dig Dug to be the the game where you inflate little enemies with a uh sort of some kind of oxygen pipe to a burst, which is just such a fucking horrendous way to go. Like really, really malicious. But this one kind of took it to a whole new level where on top of blowing up enemies and exploding them with oxygen. You could literally like drop entire chunks of a continent into the sea by like drilling at like fault lines and it just seemed like such an excessive way of killing something. It really made me laugh. That's what this game is. Zero sum, let's just fucking ruin this this island we're on to kill these red blobs. And and ones that are left on the bit of grass with me at the end. I'm gonna inflate them till their fucking eyes pop out their skull. Like just a real sicko game.

Samuel
01:17:08
Yeah. Like there's nothing about the sort of particular combat interactions or movement that's that exciting, but the moment you see a chunk of that island go in the sea I Genuinely like quite impressive given the restraints to hardware and really fun to do. I mean you you start going into a level thinking, oh what what which chunk of landmass can I slice off this time and like kill a bunch of blobs, like you say. Um I liked it as well, but it is funny because I did Google, well, why isn't the original Dig Dug on here? And then you realize it's because they're selling it for six quid or whatever. And that the original Dig Dug is beloved and this one is not beloved. Um, which is quite interesting to read about, because it's true this is not like a great game, but I was surprised at how hated it seemed to be, because it seems Seems alright, you know.

Matthew
01:17:55
Yeah, I just think like land disappearing into the ocean's just a bit too real for the modern audience. Probably, yeah. Um Yeah just that's just a doc that's a hard hitting documentary of this I'm watching that thinking, oh the house prices on that coastline, what a fucking nightmare.

Samuel
01:18:11
Yeah, you'll be there on day one of the apocalypse with your oxygen pump, ready to inflate some motherfuckers, Matthew. Right, yeah, down in Devon.

Matthew
01:18:19
Find all the second homeowners as I pump them up and explode them. Matthew just collapsed Cornwall into the ocean. But but look at the m the point bonus you got. You got ten thousand points for doing it.

Samuel
01:18:33
Oh dear. Yeah, so I kinda like Dig Dog 2 as well. Um but I do I can sort of I I sense you're definitely getting to the dregs a little bit now. So um I will say from here actually, maybe it's a good time for me to give my two top fives just as a kind of concept. I feel like I've been just throwing No. Thousands of games at you. I mean you played more games than me, so kudos. Like I I am gutted I didn't get through that those last three rows, and Star Tropics is the one I wish I'd played out of those, but So I did put here my top five of games I hadn't played or you know just just had no experience with. I put Cobra Triangle at five. It's not great, but it's alright. Um four I put Blastermaster, three I put River City Ransom, two I put RC Prim and I put Gradius at one. So that was my five of Things I was discovering playing this. And then my five of games I've played before, I put um Excite Bike at five, Kirby's Adventure at four, Punch Out at three. Two is um Super Mario Bros. and one is Super Mario Bros. three, which I think makes sense. And I echo what Matthew says about Zelda. I just um I don't think it's uh super appealing to play these days, even though I I I definitely recognise why about Mario Bros. 3 and um original Super Mario Bros. So yeah, also appreciate that they've got the lost levels here and stuff as well. Um which I I think I might have completed when I had on um I had Super Mario Bros Deluxe on Game Boy Color because you can unlock them. I think you clicked on a little Luigi head to um to play those levels if I recall correctly, Matthew. So yeah those are my um two top fives and uh I suppose like there's like a hinterland of things that are not quite not quite good. But are sort of interesting, and I guess Kid Icarus goes into that bracket. Um not true not stinkers either, you know? Yeah, I quite like Kid Icarus.

Matthew
01:20:33
I mean maybe compared to the other um mascot games of the time like Mario or Metroid, it's not as obvious like what its thing is. Just constantly climbing up a big tower. And I guess it's its hook is the mythology of it and the weird creature design and the jolly little music. When th when they said, Oh, we're making a new Kid Icarus game you weren't like, Oh yes, well that will obviously riff on this because it's so obvious what a Kid Icarus game is. You know, it's it's It's it's just like a a sort of vertical action platformer. It's it's slightly nondescript.

Samuel
01:21:08
Yeah, I kinda get that. It's um I I think it's it's alright. As a as a sort of combat game and how it feels, it it that's where it's several steps ahead, I think, of some of the other games that are in this pile of stuff. Um even if the difficulty is um is like absolutely ball breaking, which is not a term I use often on this podcast, it's very gendered um to be honest. Um but um the uh it's telling I think that the um the two games where I created restore points like that I can go back to and play later on. Work were Gradius and Kid Icarus. I was like, you know what? I kind of want to keep going with this because interesting. Yeah, there is just something quite quite cool about Kiddochris when he plays this little harp and fucks everyone up on the screen. That's pretty good, isn't it? That's there. I I want to ask you as well about the um the very first game chronologically in this is an ancient Miyamoto game that I only know. Because it's got that um in fact that's not quite right um chronologically but it's early on. Is the game that's basically Pac-Man but sacrilegious devil? Did you play that one? Devil World. Did you play that one? Yeah, I did.

Matthew
01:22:16
Yeah. What do you think of it? I I found it quite irritating because it's but it's basically Pac-Man, but The playing field like the walls of the playing field can move based on the whims of a devil. Yeah. And it runs like ass. Yeah. There's like a little devil standing at the top who's like pointing left and right and then the the world will move left and right so you can get like crushed or like stuck if you're in the wrong place. And for some reason instead of power pills you're collecting little crucifixes. Which then let you eat the Well th they don't let you eat the ghosts, they let you just eat the pills. Yeah. Kinda confusing what's going on with that, sort of symbolically. I didn't really know what I was eating.

Samuel
01:22:56
Yeah. It's that thing where I you know, I read a a bit of context behind the scenes and You know, the the prevailing sort of like assumption is that, you know, this game couldn't have been released in North America because they had all that devil panic stuff that happened in the um eighties and nineties or whatever. But I mean I think in Japan they just use like Christian imagery as a bit of a bit of like flair basically. Right. Like how all the crosses that are in Evangelian for no real reason, every explosion is a is a cross and it has no real, you know, sort of symbolism. It's just I think someone in Japan just thought, hey, this looks cool. Let's just stick this in our game. And it was uh less connected. Yeah. But I do like the idea now of um, you know, next time Miyamoto opens a new world in like uh Universal Studios, some you know US rag digging out uh you know Miyamoto believes in the Antichrist. He once made a game about the devil.

Matthew
01:23:51
He said his next theme part was gonna be Devil World.

Samuel
01:23:54
I mean that and the walls keep moving.

Matthew
01:23:56
That'd be uh Yeah, terrible. Imagine trying to eat a $30 hot dog while the moot wolves are just constantly crushing you into other people.

Samuel
01:24:05
There's that bit of music from the start of Devil World though that's is used in other Nintendo games. Because I've definitely heard that before. So it must have popped up in, I don't know, something down the line because it rang a bell when I heard it. But um Yeah, I just I don't know maybe is it a game and watch on Game Boy or something something like that, but I recognize the bit of music. Anything else that goes into that kind of interesting bracket. It's it's it's not complicated, but I do like balloon fight.

Matthew
01:24:32
I like balloon fight. It's good. It is just joust which I think predates it by a couple of years, but I also really like Joust. Just it's got good physics. There's something comically malicious about all these little guys trying to like pop each other's balloons so they can't fly anymore. Like that there's something s like s sour about that. I I like the idea of being like the only person who has flight left at the end. That's like the win state. That's like no one else can have fun but me.

Samuel
01:24:59
Uh yeah, it's an elegance to balloon fight that I think is is what makes it great. And Also the fact that you can take out enemies before they've ever taken off. That's just a great little design touch.

Matthew
01:25:12
Oh yeah. But yeah, I mean f yeah, as the story goes, famously programmed by Iwata, they have the the physics of that character. is is apparently down to him and uh is w Nintendo came to him saying, How did you do that because they wanted to implement the same physics in Mario Swimming and Super Mario Bros. So apparently that's what happened. But that's one of those that anecdote I've heard so many fucking times without ever really knowing where it originally came from. So it might not be true. Well it's also it's It's a bit like you know how Empire magazine, every other fucking issue would tell you that Indiana Jones shoots the guy because it because Harrison Ford had diarrhea? It's like one of those stories. It's like one of the most boring bits of trivia in games. That what a program balloon fight and then it made the swimming happen in Mario Bros. Um didn't stop me from repeating it here of course. I love the uh it that is true about the diarrhea though, right? Like they all yeah, but it's more just how it's always wheeled out. It's like did you know? And you're like, yeah, we all fuck it everyone knows that. Like I think he'd have to go a million miles to find someone who doesn't know that Harrison Ford had die or ear and that's why he shot that guy.

Samuel
01:26:29
Yeah. That's probably like the most discussed bout of diarrhea like in human history. It just statistically. I wonder how Harrison Ford feels about that when it keeps coming up, you know what I mean?

Matthew
01:26:37
But yeah. I mean I've I've talked about some bowel problems with like my close circle more than I probably should have.

Samuel
01:26:46
I've not heard any of those anecdotes by the way, listeners, so that's not that's not the kind of friendship me and Matthew have. Um okay, moving on then. Should we move on to some stinkeroonies, Matthew? Oh yeah. Um that 'cause I think that'd be fun um to kick a few of the lesser games here. Um yeah, I don't have uh there's a lot of things that fall into a sort of nebulous bracket of Interesting but not very good. But I think it's probably better to start with the ones that really stink before we get to any kind of also random. So what do you have here? Uh Donkey Kong Jr. Math Oh my god, so shit. So shit.

Matthew
01:27:19
It's that random countdown where they give you a number and loads of numbers and then you just have to create a sum that makes that eventual number. It's that and that but for some reason you input that sum using a monkey. Uh terrible.

Samuel
01:27:32
Imagine imagine the contestants had to climb to get the numbers, to be honest. To watch on a c watch on countdown, that would actually be quite fun. And like the Vordemans at the top looking down, being like, here's your fucking number. That's actually I've just described a great quiz show, so that's that's no good. But It's the way fucking Donkey Kong Jr. handles in this game and then his own separate game. Yeah. Where I was like, this is this is shit, you know?

Matthew
01:27:56
Yeah, that fit was like early on there's a lot of Donkey Kong on the NES Because they're obviously like Donkey Kong's the main event in the arcades and it just feels like they go all out by making a shit maths game, introducing a shit boy. and then then you get like the p the p proper sequel, Donkey Kong Three, and it's like all about exterminating bugs and like puffing up bug extermination gas at wasps and it's just so wide of the mark. Donkey Kong outside of Donkey Kong 1 on the notes is a bit of a disaster.

Samuel
01:28:29
Yeah. Um did you um have new appreciation for Missile Command after playing Donkey Kong 3, Matthew?

Matthew
01:28:35
Uh I did.

Samuel
01:28:37
I was like this is shit missile command basically. Could cross with Space Invaders, you know?

Matthew
01:28:41
Yeah, I could see that. Of course, I mean Donkey Kong, you've got the Game Boy version, which is absolutely amazing. So all the all the magic is happening elsewhere.

Samuel
01:28:49
Yeah. Um I was gonna say, can we Can we slump in every single fucking ASDA SmartPrice sports title that comes out on this platform? Cause I thought they were all bad. I I didn't play a single one where I thought this is good tennis is okay actually, that's not true. Tennis is always okay. That's a that's just a video game rule. Well even then though I think the depth perception with the ball is slightly fucked. There was a few shots I missed where I was like, I shouldn't have missed that. And it's because I can't totally work out where the ball is because of these primitive graphics. Um but I would say I I didn't play anything I thought was as good as the um real sports volleyball an Atari twenty six hundred quite a nice it's a pretty nice looking and responsive game, but I don't think any of those were good. What wheel is the thing?

Matthew
01:29:33
The feebleist bone that you throw to Atari. Nice volleyball.

Samuel
01:29:38
I don't know why I'm I'm I feel like I'm now being too defensive about Atari, which i it's it's preposterous really. That's not really um how I want to position myself.

Matthew
01:29:46
No, I I'd agree with that. All the sports ones, uh there's a couple of yeah bad versions of golf.

Samuel
01:29:51
Yeah, they're bad.

Matthew
01:29:52
The weird thing is, I'm I mean I I'm not saying this is bad tip and you put it in your top five, so it's it's obviously got you know, something going for it. I've never really understood Excite Bike. You don't like it.

Samuel
01:30:04
It's sort of like early trials, right? That's kind of the thing with it. Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Well, I will say that I I think it looked about three times better on 3DS. I think maybe it's my affection for that version that works quite well. It's just it's just simple.

Matthew
01:30:25
And works pretty well. Yeah. Curious about uh why it was so high up with this, but that's that's fair enough. Um I would say along with grouping all the sports, I would also group um block puzzling games. So I'd probably put in Yoshi Wario's Woods and definitely I fucking hate Doctor Mario. Yeah. I've always thought this an end gamer was always bad mouthing Dr. Mario. I just I just don't really get it as a as a puzzle game because you're chucking all these pills to try and basically t get like coloured pills to line up next to a bacteria to kind of kill it off. Uh so if there's a red bacteria it needs three bits of red pills. But What it often becomes about is if you make an error, if you sort of fuck up, you then spend so long waiting for the right coloured pill to come along, to start removing the wrong coloured pills which are piling up. on top of the bacteria. If there's a level or or like a a technique or a gimmick to Doctor Mario that I'm somehow missing that unlocks it and turns it into like an amazing world class puzzle game. I I just don't know what the appeal is uh outside of the theme tune, which is a banger. But it's just Mario chucking pills down a patient's neck.

Samuel
01:31:44
It's really odd. I just think Sega are better at this type of thing than Nintendo. Yeah. Um so yeah, I I c I agree with you on that one. I'm not really a big Dr. Marrow guy. Um what do you make of uh Nez Tetris? Um because I I I can't say This is I think when you have any kind of relationship with either of the Game Boy uh like the DX version or the original version. There's something about this that's that's just a tiny bit underwhelming. And maybe it's just because there are so many different versions of Tetris you can play there better than this, but uh It's it's visually quite unappealing. It is, yeah.

Matthew
01:32:16
Very pared down. Yeah, very very bland. Uh and I think I y when I think, you know, older Tetris, I just it's so tied to the you know, the specific screen of the Game Boy that it just it it feels unnatural here. I mean it's a perfectly fine game of Tetris. Like you can play it and it's it's not it doesn't feel like particularly wonky or or bad or anything. Yeah, I just think there are obviously better ways to play Tetris now.

Samuel
01:32:43
Yeah, that's true. Um so what else you got as stinker in you, Matthew?

Matthew
01:32:47
Uh I really hated uh Mighty Bomb Jack

Samuel
01:32:50
Oh yeah, I hated that as well. Fuck that game.

Matthew
01:32:52
About a guy collecting bombs in an Egyptian tomb for some reason.

Samuel
01:32:57
I turned that that was probably that's gotta be in the top five of games I turned off like the quickest. Um I was just like, this is there's nothing here. There's no reason to play this, you know?

Matthew
01:33:07
I just didn't understand how they got to Egypt or what the connection was. Like, oh yeah, that was confusing. Um I really hated Clue Clue Land. Yeah, that was rubbish. Whit where you're trying to get around like a grid to I don't even know what you're trying to achieve in the grid. Collect dots, collect fruit, something or other. But the way you get around the grid is you sort of swing on these poles, you sort of swing on a corner and like rotate around it. And then send yourself off at a different angle. I just c I just couldn't get into the uh uh the swing of things. Yeah, it felt terrible to me. Like just a huge miss of a control scheme

Samuel
01:33:45
It's sort of it's incredibly fiddly the the turning. You're like, I'm pretty sure I turned there and then he didn't turn and then he turns at another point, you're like, Oh I don't feel it's like playing it's like someone got you know, sort of six tenths of the way to uh three fifths, if you will, um of the way to just uh to coming up with snake and then but didn't totally land it. So he's forming these little walls as he goes and it's yeah it's just stiff and kind of annoying. It feels like it should be better than it actually is. Didn't this get brought back with where I wear smooth moves, Matthew. Is this a 'cause I looked this up and it's apparently like um I think it's like a 3D uh version of this that pops up in that game. Does that ring a bell?

Matthew
01:34:27
That doesn't ring a bell.

Samuel
01:34:28
I mean I've It's been a while though, right?

Matthew
01:34:30
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, fair enough. I mean that's I don't really understand how what the connection would be.

Samuel
01:34:36
Uh well I guess it's just a mini game, right? So Yeah. This yeah. Um yeah. I've got um Atlantis no Nazo. I don't remember what that one is, but I wrote shite next to that one, Matthew. I think that was qu quest for Atlantis.

Matthew
01:34:48
Yes, that's right. Just a really bad t two D platformer action game. I think you th maybe you threw balls or something.

Samuel
01:34:55
Yeah, that's that's right. Um I will say in general, like the the m the biggest mixed bag kind of group of games here were ones that only released in Japan and that You you know, you've not and that weren't released here. And so you die dive into them and think, okay, I'll see what the deal is, and then kind of having v pretty variable experiences with them. Um it seems like you pulled out the most interesting one with that that beat em up that came out in nineteen ninety three that I've forgotten the name of, Matthew. But um I also thought that Uh so did you play uh I'm sure you did Ninja Jaju Marokan? Yeah, yeah. It's kinda like another version of Ice Climbers, really. Um Yeah.

Matthew
01:35:38
Reminded me of like original Mario Brothers, not Super Mario Brothers, but original Mario Brothers except with throwing stars. You're just jumping up and down levels, throwing stars at like ghosts.

Samuel
01:35:51
Yeah, not very interesting. Um, slightly more interesting. Would you call the mysterious Murasame castle a stinker, Matthew? There's sort of like something about this one but it felt like it was just way too hard to really make any progress with. What did you play this one?

Matthew
01:36:06
Yeah I did play it. I know I I actually haven't written down anything next to it. I have no idea what my opinion of it is. Uh but I'm pretty sure this was another one which was referenced in either Smash Brothers. Did this actually have a minigame in Nintendo Land?

Samuel
01:36:24
Uh, let's find out.

Matthew
01:36:25
Nintendo Land had one mini game which was based on something super obscure.

Samuel
01:36:30
Yeah, you are right actually. The minigame Takamaru's ninja castle is based on the mysterious Murasame castle.

Matthew
01:36:36
Yeah, well well remembered. Good to I I guess good to know what that was all about, not that I can remember anything about it.

Samuel
01:36:44
Well there's a kind of it's a little bit zeldery in terms of combat really, where you're basically going through these screens packed with enemies and then just uh using kind of like you know ninja abilities to avo avoid uh getting killed you're chucking again like projectiles you've got a sword it's It's like alright, but it's it's sort of a game of Is this the one where you could go under the ground? Yeah, you could sort of and then pop out again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did play this, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so it's it's it's alright I would say. It's not like a proper stinkeroone. Do you have any other out and out stinkeroonies, Matthew? I hated Mappy Land.

Matthew
01:37:18
Yeah, me too. That was off after about ten seconds. It was so hard. There was just always like f really fast cats trying to kill me and I was a mouse. Um cats everywhere. That's what I've written down in my notes.

Samuel
01:37:29
Cats everywhere. Um I gotta say I didn't really get I can I could see why the fundamentals of combat were alright, but Ghosts and Goblins was just so fucking hard on Ghouls and Goblins. Gonna remember the name of it actually. I might write that down wrong.

Matthew
01:37:45
The thing I've never understood about that is the core character, the little Sir Arthur guy, the gimmick that when he s gets hit he loses his clothes and he's in his pants. That feels like that should be in a game that like a regular person should be able to enjoy. Like that's a joke which is like dumb enough for like an like a normal person. But it's in a game which is so hard that I just don't know if anyone would ever really appreciate that. Like the tone of it comic

Samuel
01:38:12
The comic tone is completely at odds with the difficulty. Yeah, it it's just one of those series where it like starts in arcades and they bought it and then it sort of gets has its best version on snares. I feel like that's the trajectory of this series. And so Super Ghouls and Ghosts is the one that people really like. But is this the uh it's also I think the only Capcom game that's on here?

Matthew
01:38:31
The Capcom love to resell their games I guess, but but they didn't throw it like a single, you know, Mega Man bone or whatever is That seems a bit tough. Little bit of a bionic commando, that would have been good.

Samuel
01:38:42
Yeah, for sure. I actually do think that when you play uh if you've played any of the older Mega Man games, the the visual limitations of the NES make you appreciate how nice those games actually look. So yeah. Um but that was um that was pretty much it for my oh and I I didn't like uh uh pinball kinda goes in that bracket of NAF sports games, like the most basic ass pinball game, I imagine.

Matthew
01:39:05
I didn't wa yeah, the the only thing I did like about Pinball is it's got like a side table you can get access to where like Princess Peach is like trapped inside the table and you're trying to bounce the ball to save her and then you have to sort of move a little platform to kind of carry her to safety. I just I liked the the idea that there was like a little person trapped inside this pinball table I think that's that was enough of notes to get get get it out of just the out and out shit part of my list.

Samuel
01:39:34
I mean it does work as a pinball game. Like it's it's not really it's not a stinkerone in the way that I think that the um Uh some of the I think that volleyball game is genuinely incoherent, like w who's actually meant to be playing at any one time. It's an absolute mess. But the pinball game actually works. It's just the most basic kind of form of pinball you can really um you could really think of. Um I I don't have any other out and out thinkers really. Everything else falls into the middle bracket really, um, which is probably not worth highlighting here, Matthew. So uh anything else you wanted to call out uh before we wrap up? People should give that

Matthew
01:40:05
Nightshade game ago. It isn't very good, but it's it's quite interesting to see the point and click genre in a gap. I don't think that was on any other platform either. You know, that only lives here and It's a game with like a lot of ideas, not many of them good, but it's it's quite interesting to see those ideas happening, you know, when they were happening.

Samuel
01:40:26
Yeah, for sure. Um probably also worth saying actually as well while we're here that original Metroid is good, but you can just play zero mission. Oh yeah. Definitely play zero mission. Yeah. That's the thing. It's only really uh worth it enjoying as I mean uh you know you you're gonna have access to Zero Mission anyway if you have access to this. There's no reason to play this version uh to just to look at it as it was I guess. Yeah it's quite hard work playing original Metroid now. Tech issues as well. Zero Mission has some of the nicest um pixel art ever, so it's um well worth playing. Um okay, so I mean yeah I I did want to ask Uh b well actually I won't ask about the progression because you didn't play them in in chronological order. So that's that's now a complete bust of a question. And I've kind of made my point there anyway. I think you do see Bits and pieces of progression, but there's not really th not enough of the games from third parties are here to tell the whole story. That's the problem, you know?

Matthew
01:41:20
Yeah, the only thing we would say is that in those very early games Like some of them are quite slight in the way that I associate with the Atari games. You know, they're like one idea and maybe like four alternative play modes That's definitely true. Like that's just I guess what games seemed to be and what was deemed acceptable, but then they become like more complete packages. Not long after that they're they're already g have a lot more shape to them. Uh and I guess also like the obvious games from the arcade turned into console versions here. they seem to h hold up a bit better and and resemble the thing that you probably played in the arcades a bit more closely just due to the power of the hardware. But I know o out of that outside of that, you know, th and those are trends which die off. you know, not many years into it. Yeah, by the end they're some of them could be SNES games, they're that good.

Samuel
01:42:18
Yeah, I I completely agree with you. Uh I was curious, based on that, if there are any games here that you would deliberately play on purpose these days, if given the option, Matthew. Would any make it into that bracket? Well that I haven't played already. Well I guess I gu yeah, let's I suppose let's apply that criteria because obviously you've already played. It's hard to have any fresh comments on Mario or Zelda or Metroid really. Like it's they're such familiar quantities, but Yeah, anything else that would escape the the limbo of um you know a forgotten page of the Nintendo Switch Online service?

Matthew
01:42:49
Generally think Punch Out's worth a look. It's quite singular, like it it is its thing. I know there's Super Punch Out as well, but I I I don't know, I kind of Super Punch Out's nice, but uh the the art style is a little bit more obnoxious to my eye. Star Tropics I do think is interesting. Probably worth a go. Like, you may not play it all the way through to the end, but I think it's it's like also just, you know, a part of Nintendo history which just didn't go anywhere. Like that that world and that character hasn't you know, i i isn't getting sort of um revisited now. So uh that's yeah, that's kind of interesting. I don't know, I'm to be honest, I had a pretty good day and a half just dipping into these. Like I liked it as an exercise. I don't think it's like a huge a huge waste of your time to sort of dip into to most of this.

Samuel
01:43:37
Yeah, I I do I do recommend doing it the order I did it in. I I think that works quite well. Because I think once you get to those last few rows, you really start seeing what they're kinda like the big the big winners were at the very end of the platform of platform's life and and just how what Matthew says about how it goes from very simple arcade based experiences to games that are a bit more fully formed that seem like more like SNES games. Um you definitely get to experience that arc. I think it's also fair to still nope out when something just feels immediately like a bust. Or like you don't really understand what the hell's going on and you and the game hasn't explained it to you and you but you've got a feeling it's gonna be boring or hard or annoying, like and you j and you just turn it off There's like that game where it starts with you as you're like a little circle man and you're in a room and there's like two there's like a treasure chest and two little heart things on the ground and a little snake lad who's sort of looking at you walking around.

Matthew
01:44:34
Adventure of Lolo. That went straight off my friend.

Samuel
01:44:36
Oh that was that was absolute dog shit, that one. Yeah. Yeah, so occasionally you'll encounter things like that, but To be honest, I was actually, I will give Nintendo praise. This is a lot deeper as a library than I thought it was. It's not comprehensive, but it is deep. There's a lot, there's just a lot here, but there's a-there was a lot on the platform Um but it feels like they've got their arms around more of it than I I would have expected based on how slight the offerings have been for like some of the later consoles they've done over the years, you know. Um Yeah. So I agree. Well worth that. And people say they're cons they're not consumer friendly. Um as long as you don't want them to explain any of them to you, that's um that's then you're fine basically.

Matthew
01:45:19
Yeah, it's just them pushing uh clue clue land across the table at you and going, what do you make of that, huh? And you're just like, I I don't know.

Samuel
01:45:29
I have no shitting idea, mate. Um there was also that game that was um Where you it's like a you're in a car and you're driving on multiple levels and it's city connection. Rubbish. Oh, so nasty. You have to paint the town red.

Matthew
01:45:42
So City Connection, that was uh that was really useful. It when I when I was on Endgame, I used to do a feature called uh round the world in eight bit days where it was each month we'd pick a continent or, you know, a country sometimes And we'd we'd find like ten NES games that were set in that country just to show how those countries were depicted in the limited graphics of the time. And City Connection, like each level is is set in a different country, so that one was always coming up. Like I always knew I had like one in the bank because of City Connection. You're like New York no problem. Paris absolutely it's all in the background of this terrible driving game.

Samuel
01:46:25
Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, it's it's it's rubbish that one. Um but again it's it is quite different to anything else you'll play in the in the batch I guess, but you'll only play it for twenty seconds, so it's fine, and then you'll turn it off and get on with your life. Um so Matthew, the last thing I wanted to ask you was what should we do next for one of these? I mean next month we're doing um the two Mario Galaxy games anyway, so we're taking care of really for for the time being. But um I think there's more we can do in this kind of area. Um but what do you think is like a a good fit for us? Yes.

Matthew
01:46:59
Rather than play one thing in in loads of depth, we'll dip a toe in like 70 games for you and and tr try and f find our way through that somehow. Uh I quite liked what you suggested uh before we recorded actually of uh maybe looking at rare replay at some point.

Samuel
01:47:17
Yeah, I think that I think the rare replay could be the one, you know.

Matthew
01:47:20
It's got the

Samuel
01:47:21
the right sort of Nintendo adjacent appeal that I think a lot of our listeners will like. And I, you know, I I know you've played it before, right? But I never have.

Matthew
01:47:29
Yeah, yeah, I th I thought it was great.

Samuel
01:47:31
Yeah, so that and that has some context for the different games, right, as well.

Matthew
01:47:34
Draws little mini games out, has like a sort of its own little challenge system in them. trying to actually teach you how to play them and like understand them as well.

Samuel
01:47:42
Yeah, so I I think that might be that might be the one. But um it's funny because when you get to Snezz, I wonder if the game's become a bit too complicated to have that dip-in experience that we've you know what I mean? Like it's Yeah. Not no that's not true for all games, but I mean you know the RPG is a big genre on snares, for example, and we're just not going to be able to do any of those games justice. Um

Matthew
01:48:06
Just games which just retro games which are playable through a Yakuza game.

Samuel
01:48:11
Oh, I like that. That's good. Um d that means I'll have to like make a certain amount pr of progression in the judgment games, which I've never touched before. And um That one um Yakuza guidance spin-off that's got the um fucking Virtue of Fight in it in it and stuff.

Matthew
01:48:27
That'll be uh Yeah in judgment he's got the Master System in his office and he's got like twenty Master System games to play.

Samuel
01:48:34
I love that as a contrived bit of world building. That's uh that's cool. Um yes, did they put any in um pirate accuser this year or did they not bother with that one?

Matthew
01:48:42
Oh, I think there are no there definitely are arcades in it, but I can't think what they are.

Samuel
01:48:47
They've got to be running low on their actual sort of like stock of Sega games from that time, you know?

Matthew
01:48:52
It's Yeah, some real dregs. I I'm just counting down the days till they do that Sonic the Hedgehog popcorn machine. Yeah Yeah. You just have to sort of spin a wheel to get some popcorn out of it. I mean I hope they do do that 'cause that would be perfect for that w for that

Samuel
01:49:08
you know, world. I would love it if they did the basketball one where it's just it's nothing sonic about it other than the theming, but he could just stand there chucking the balls and that'd be good. Imagine if they have put a ghost squad in it. Oh, I mean that'd be s I mean I guess that would wouldn't work without motion controls, right? So that's the problem with that one.

Matthew
01:49:25
Yeah, but you could probably do it with like the definitely the motion controller on the PlayStation for you know the dual sense motion controller's probably up to it. The Joy-Cons.

Samuel
01:49:34
Dreamcast games have not really touched, have they? Or like Saturn ports and stuff like that. These are all things I think. You know. Yeah, it probably is. It's like, oh yeah, for some reason Key's gotta play Burning Rangers um before he goes to his next appointment or something like that. Um yeah, it's i yeah, you're probably right. They're probably just to excavate those for other purposes. But yeah, I think rare replay definitely in our future and we'll have a little think on what else we could potentially do down the line. So if you've got any suggestions, by all means um Put them on the Patreon post. But I I do like this this format. Just dip in, see what happens. Yes, I fucked it by not playing the last three rows here, which had most of Matthew's picks of the best games. But um That's how that's how it be sometimes. Um I nonetheless enjoyed discussing these with you, Matthew. That was fun. So, the XXL episode this month will be all about the films we're seeing at different film festivals, uh, this week and next, which is Quite a fun thing um that me and Matthew are are sort of like dabbling in at the moment. And uh yes, the next regular podcast will be the best games. Wait, the games set in Japan, Hall of Fame, uh some combination of those words basically. So Yeah, thank you so much for your support and uh catch you later. Goodbye.

Matthew
01:50:47
Goodbye. Santa L
