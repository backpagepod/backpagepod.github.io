Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast, supported by DoorDash. I'm Sammy Roberts, joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Sorry, and that was truly improvised and supported by, didn't even quite sound right, did it?
But I just chucked it in. Bit of Monday night wild energy there, Matthew.
It was actually precious little DoorDash in Geoff's thing.
Just a tiny bit, a little taste of DoorDash. That's all you got, a little smidgen of DoorDash. And it was backloaded as well, the DoorDash stuff.
If you like Kingdom Hearts 4, then I've got news for you. Sora is delivering DoorDash to your house. There's none of that this time.
So yeah, a little bit different. So Matthew, you and I have made a pact off air to basically avoid industry commentary this year for the purposes of our mutual sanity and our various lines of work. So there's not going to be too much of that in this episode.
And by the way, if you read Twitter 24 hours a day, you'll get that these days for the games industry. So does anyone need more of it? I would argue no, they don't.
So we talk about the games themselves in this podcast. That's what we do. But I was curious, Matthew, the one question I wanted to ask you before we get to this episode, which is the 10 most anticipated games of the year.
Are we going to look back on this year as a banger year for games now that the schedule is shaping up a little bit?
I think it could be. Like there's so much exciting stuff. Sorry, this question is throwing me, because I've just realised I've picked games that are due out in 2025.
Oh, no, that's fine, because that's okay. It's called 10 Most Anticipated Games. They don't have to be now.
Some are buying and not this year. It's okay. Don't panic and just answer the question.
Okay, well, I withdraw that panic and replace it with enthusiasm for the rest of the year, specifically to 2024. I've had a great run so far, felt a little bit droughty for like a month, maybe, where it's kind of like, I don't really know what the next things are going to be. But then all of a sudden, autumn and winter has really kind of come into focus during this summer game fest period, or whatever it is that we're calling it.
I'm liking the look of a lot of those later games. And, you know, it was looking a little bit, you know, for people who have crass AAA tastes, as I do.
That is important to specify, because you said there was a drought, and I would argue there's not been a drought, really, if you follow indie games, just on the blockbuster side.
But, you know, I don't do that, so.
Did you play D'Anable well?
Yeah, I did play.
And Crow Country?
Yeah, but I mean, I'm really like talking, like the last two weeks, I've struggled to pick up the thread on anything new.
Right.
That's probably what I'm referring to, but that shows how packed this year's been, that it only takes two weeks for you to, it feels suddenly noticeably less like, oh, I've been playing five star games all year, up until the last two weeks, and it's gone horribly wrong in late May. If anything, I filled that time with the things I missed early in the year, because I was playing Infinite Wealth for 5,000 hours, so I am finally on the Bellatro train, but that'sâ€¦
Bellatrol.
Bellatrol. We'll save that for another time. But I would say whether you're a triple A fiend, or a lover of fine indie games, I think you've pretty amazingly covered on both fronts so far, and going forwards this year.
And now you said Bellatrol, though, that's completely thrown me and just sort of like made me think, are we teasing a better episode when Matthew just talks about Bellatrol for an hour? But it's fine, we can come back to it. It's okay.
It'll be all right. But yes, I too am very optimistic about this year. I think it was one of those things where it hadn't quite shaped up because we didn't know where things were going to land.
And then in the last couple of weeks, with the sort of sheer amount of showcases and the fact that games marketing cycles these days seem to be trimmed down to about three months by some publishers, so it's super, super short. It means that we suddenly have a big array of things to look forward to at the end of the year, in terms of the blockbusters, I agree. And yeah, this is an interesting one this season as well, because indie games do a lot of heavy lifting in these showcases too, because there's a lot of showcases.
And as the industry contracts, are there too many showcases for the number of games there are? It's something we talked about before in the podcast. But it's like, you know, the indie games have to do a lot of padding out, because, you know, there's not so many blockbusters go around that they can all be filled with that stuff.
So everyone at this time of year gets exposed to a bunch of cool stuff, I think, regardless of which live streams they tune into. I watched about half of them. We just finished the Ubisoft one when this podcast started.
So we have seen all of them. But everything, I think we've seen, Matthew, apart from the Dragon Age Veil Guard unveiling, which is coming tomorrow when we're recording this.
Well, you're going to be annoyed. I have just watched that, so.
Oh, have you watched it because of your line of work? Oh, well, that's fine. I'm not annoyed by that.
That's, I get free podcast content out of it. So it's a joint operation, this, Matthew. I also benefit.
And besides, I've seen 30 seconds of it on Twitter, so I'm very excited still.
Yeah.
But that's OK. But that's the sort of game I'm talking about. It's kind of come out of nowhere, it's coming out this year.
Does it have a release date this game?
Fall 2024.
Well, there you go. So that's an example of a game that I think that maybe it was actually maybe they said last year it was already coming out this year, but it just, you know, it's been a little while since we've had a Bioware game, five years, in fact. So big deal that this has come along.
That's the sort of thing that snuck onto the schedules, basically. And suddenly we have a September to November period that's full of stuff. Should be exciting.
I think it's still coming this year that don't have release dates. So yeah, plenty to look forward to, I think. But Matthew, we've got 20 games to discuss here, probably fewer than that, because we'll have some crossover.
And we're doing the classic, our sort of like games of the different year episodes for that really here, the Chet and John's thing of just counting down our 10 most anticipated games. We've pretty much been doing this every year. It's like one of our sort of annual pods.
Well, you kicked it off without me, with Jeremy Peele.
Oh yeah, 2022. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was a bit strange to do it that way.
I think he brought a thoroughness to it that I have yet to bring. I didn't bring last year and probably won't bring this year, if I'm being honest.
I've come to rely on you for sheer vibes, if not precision, you know, and that's okay.
Well, that's good because a lot of games we watched seem to be trading on just pure vibes.
Oh yeah, absolutely. And there's not that much. I mean, one of my games doesn't even have a Steam page and I just couldn't find any information on it unless I read the director breaking it down in a blog.
That's all I could find.
Did you dream it? Because I know that your dreams have been affected recently by these showcases.
Oh yeah. So, anybody watched Day of the Devs? The trailer for Zookosis, the game where you have to look after some animals that are sick from some kind of weird supernatural disease and there's some spooky zookeeper there.
It was the last thing I watched on Friday night before I went to bed. And I dreamt about giraffes emerging out of the dark. I just had these really weird nightmares.
And then it turns out I'm connected on LinkedIn. I don't want to say friend, but someone on there was like, oh, I got a zookosis at this thing. So I decided to share my dream in their comments.
No response yet, Matthew. But I'm expecting any day now.
You told them about it.
Yeah, I thought this game really left an impact on me. I genuinely dreamt about it. So yeah, I'm officially the weirdest man on LinkedIn.
But I regret nothing. So there.
Sorry, I missed so much of that anecdote. Or like that it was on LinkedIn.
Do you think I said this in person?
No, I thought you commented under a video.
No, no, no. It was to a person on LinkedIn who was talking about how cool it was. I think it's basically maybe a PR or something.
I don't know, but what do you want from me, man? The more you ask me about it, the weirder it sounds. So it's, you know, but Zuko says, yes, that infiltrated my dreams.
But yes, the period of live streams is over pretty much. So we can all get on with our lives until games come. But we have 20 games to talk about here.
So Matthew, why don't you kick off with your number 10?
I've got the most basic bitch pick imaginable. Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater.
Pyro on my list.
Yes, you're even more basic than I am.
That's fucking rude. Well, I've got one game that you'll never pick, which is Age of Mythology Definitive Edition.
I'm not touching that.
Didn't you message me? I know, in fact, it's not even called that. It's called Age of Mythology Retold.
Like I say, pure vibes, but zero precision. That's what you get in this podcast. Yes, so Age of Mythology Retold.
That's my bad. I think that was maybe what the Age of Empires 2 one was called anyway. So basically, this is a very spruced up version of the, I think, 2001 RTS game where they basically asked the question, what if you took Age of Empires 2 and all of its William Wallace stuff, but added loads of monsters to it?
That's basically what Age of Mythology was. The very beloved game, I think it sold pretty well as well, but it was sort of like in the period before RTS games entered a real downturn. People stopped playing those and started playing MOBAs, which are clearly inferior genre, but the children are wrong, not me there.
So what can I say? But yes, this has been revived in the wake of the successful Age of Empires revival movement, I guess. It's been happening the last five or six years where they've revived all these old games, put them on Steam and Game Pass.
You can go play them and they don't cost that much money, but they're very nicely done and nicely preserved. They've done them Age of Pathology and they've just given it a real graphical overhaul. So giants walking around and just like Troy getting fucked up, and Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Atlantean stuff all joining in, dragons and shit.
I think it was like extended edition re-release of the original about 10 years ago, which I reviewed for PC Gamer. I remember it was pretty good, pretty enjoyable. But it definitely showed its age, and it's nice to have this version, which I think doesn't look like a brand new RTS as such, but it looks very contemporary, I would say.
It looks very playable and by modern standards. So I'm quite looking forward to it. Thoughts, Matthew?
I'm not surprised this one's on here. I definitely messaged you when I saw this of this is your shit.
Yeah.
Is this stuff just designed to sell to the people who loved it 20 years ago? Mission success, is it punching through to a new audience? Definitely not me, but maybe that's fine.
Maybe that's perfectly okay.
I mean, you could say all that about like Mario, Zelda, etc. Do you know what I mean? Really?
You think like-
Well, they do a 2D Mario game.
I don't think it's quite the same.
Well, they do a 2D Mario game.
But as a genre, it's far more of an acquired taste. There are many more people who just like a platformer. I'm not saying that in a sneering way or that I don't like it.
Well, look, I appreciate you meeting me slightly less than halfway on that one.
I haven't made it halfway on it.
No, that's fine. Why don't we get to your number 9, Matthew?
My number 9 is probably the one I'm least sure about, but I'm very interested in, which is Slitterhead.
Oh, yeah. Big PS3 game vibes. I was into it.
Yeah. So this is Bokeh Games, which is headed by Kichiro Toyama, who is Mr. Silent Hill, Mr. Siren and Mr. Gravity Rush. We'll say not much about that last one.
Whatever you say about this guy, a truly original thinker and has always done big, interesting ideas in... It's not the mainstream space, but in the confines of working for Sony, he was doing interesting stuff and this, for people who don't know, is a... it's sort of set in a kind of a...
Oh, what's that walled city called?
The... Kowloon, is it?
Yeah, Kowloon. Yeah, that's right. So it's set in a sort of Chinese city without those kind of Kowloon walled city vibes.
It's sort of how it looks. A horror game. Interestingly, kind of...
I thought this was going to be a quite sort of Silent Hill. It seemed to be selling itself on, like, look how fucked up and deranged this monster design is. It's like, from the freaks who made Silent Hill come a new generation of meat monstrosities.
And, like, there is some of that. But it also has a hefty dose of siren, which was a kind of not body hopping, but sort of perception hopping horror game where you could look through the eyes of the zombie attackers to see what they see and use that to work out where they were in the world. And this has a...
you are a spirit rather than a set character, and you can move between any bodies in the world. So, like, you possess people. That has, like, a little bit of exploration potential because, you know, you can possess someone who's inside a building, and then you're inside a building and you don't have to get into that building, for example.
But there's also... it sounds like there's a little bit of Watch Dogs Legion to it, in that the different people you possess, you know, you're then stuck in the bodies with, like, you know, are you a young, strong person or a slow, old person? And then the third layer on top of it is that you're trying to find these horrible monsters who, I think, are possessing other people.
And the combat is Silent Hill-ish in that it's kind of melee, hitting people with pipes and that kind of stuff. But you can also body hop out of your current body into another body to escape. So the body hopping has a spatial element to it, or maybe you body hop into a body behind your attacker so you can then hit your attacker from behind.
And it's implied in a big IGN interview and hands-on that I read that the bodies are just there to be thrown away. Your job isn't to keep all the bodies alive. If the body dies with you in it, that's game over for you.
But as long as there's a living body, you've got a potential escape route. So it's actually this weird body jumping thing. And I don't know, I think that's intriguing.
Intriguing enough to maybe get you over the hurdle of, like you say, the powerful PS3 energy of the visuals of this game.
Yeah, and I'm not saying that as like a criticism. It just, it looks like a game that Sony Japan would release in like 2010. And everyone over here, like forums over here, like Rift, etc, etc, would be like going, when are you going to bring this over, Sony?
And it's 2013, the PS4 launches, and this releases like two weeks after the PS4, and eight people buy it. And that's like the profile of this game to me. You know what I mean?
Like end-of-the-generation PS3 curio. And I really mean that in the nicest possible way. So definitely play this.
I thought it looked really specific and like, and just, you know what I mean? It just looks so unusual. And I think everyone probably went into it expecting a more conventional survival horror experience.
It's just not that at all. It's just much stranger.
Yeah, I like that. That strangeness persists, you know? Like that's just his thing.
He's just trying something new in a relatively conservative space. I think it's cool.
And that is the funny thing. And it's the thing that drives Silent Hill fans mad is there is no one vision of what Silent Hill is. And like even its own creators don't want to just do the same thing twice.
So people are just driven mad, basically trying to get back to whatever there is Silent Hill 2 gave them. They're just not going to get back again. It's quite interesting.
But yes, I definitely want to play this. A good pick, Matthew. I'm glad you picked something interesting even if you're unsure about it.
So my next game is my number nine is Tenjutsu. This is one of the games that was revealed during the Devolver showcase from the designer of Dead Cells. So it's got some good sort of combat cred, but it's not quite a side scrolling sort of like beat-em-up kind of thing.
It's actually like a top down sort of beat-em-up. You can sort of moving around these sort of large rooms. There's a bit of like hyper light drifter energy to it.
A lot of like dodging, sort of like using different abilities, beating up dudes, avoiding sort of like, you know, sort of the ranged attacks, that sort of thing. And basically what you're... It's been described as like a combat rogue-like, and you're basically trying to dismantle these four syndicates on each run.
And basically like, I think you can take them on in different orders, and then you can sort of like invest in various kind of like meta, sort of like currencies around the outside to make things a little bit easier on yourself. The graphics are really beautiful. It's just kind of like, it's called Secret Garden City, but you are described as basically like a renegade yakuza.
Basically trying to take this city back or take over the city. It was introduced with this really beautiful sort of 90s anime, sort of like FMV, which set the tone nicely. I was delighted to see that the sort of animations in the game, the combat and stuff, just really, really beautiful, really nice effects.
Lots of like LED lighting at night, sort of visuals. It really looks good. It looks like a mix of, like I say, Hyper Light Drifter, but also a little bit of Scott Pilgrim in there as well.
And then like Dead Cells, probably appropriate too. And I guess like recent sort of beat-em-up type of games, maybe a tiny bit of like Sifu in there, for example. But I don't know, just looks like a good time.
Did you see the trailer for this one, Matthew?
I actually saw a little bit of this a while back in a sort of secret capacity and thought it looked cool. In my head, it's a little bit like a slower Hotline Miami. Is that right?
There's definitely something in that. It doesn't look like you're necessarily picking up items all the time in the same way you are in Hotline Miami, but definitely in terms of the amount of space you have on screen and how fast it moves. There's something in that for sure.
Yeah, I'm into it. I think Devolve will always pick up on interesting stuff. There may be some other games that look a bit like it.
They always hone in on the best example of it.
I mean, a different developer, but I definitely believe in the Devolver thing after playing Pepper Grindr this year. I had a very good time with that.
I believe in Devolver. You got a big Volvey tat.
I actually didn't watch the showcase. I'm not aware of the Volvey lore, but I do know that Andy Kelly is partly driving it, which is, I think, a good... It's always where he was going to end up, I think, is writing the lore for a fictional mascot.
Yeah, I think that was always going to happen. But yeah, it looks good. It was tough, because there were a few different...
I have picked a lot of blockbusters in my list, and I'm sure you have too, but there were quite a few indie trailers that looked pretty cool. I think it was The Arranger that was at the...
Well, it's funny you should say that. That's my number eight.
Is it really? Well, that's a perfect segue that I reversed into. So go ahead.
This isn't just me throwing a bone to indie fare. This was one of the ones from Day of the Devs that just jumped out to me. I think they describe it as like an RPG in the kind of sort of Zelda mold.
You are a character going on a quest. But the way this character navigates the world and moves is that the world is tile based and the tiles kind of scroll under her like a conveyor belt. So they can scroll left to right or up to down, up down and you like move the world to kind of carry her around it.
And likewise, objects that are around her. So objects on other tiles will kind of come with her. And it seems that a lot of the puzzles are about using this weird conveyor belt tile setup to steer keys into locks or get a sword between the character and an enemy and then scroll the sword and character towards the enemy to stab them.
And I just thought the Central Mechanic looked like something I hadn't seen before. It looked like it's going to be ultra simple to control. Like I would be surprised if it was literally just up and down, left and right, which seems very elegant.
And they talked about the reason we love this system is that it awoke all these mad ideas in our head. And, you know, the game's about taking you to different scenarios and really like maxing out this one idea, which is that kind of classic Nintendo thing of you've got on mechanic and then you just explore it as deeply as you can and come up with as many scenarios as possible. And, you know, even in the course of this little like two minute demo, you know, she was in always kind of mad different places and there were like boss fights and then there seemed to be like very complicated spatial puzzles and dungeon puzzles.
And yeah, it just looked very different, but looked very satisfying with it. I also just like the nonchalance of a character who like doesn't move and is carried by the world that has like big us energy.
Yeah, I thought this looked really nice. It was on my list and I can't remember why I didn't put it on there. Probably just got very excited by Xbox Showcase games and just decided to turn my back on Indies like a bastard.
But this did it really good. And Day of the Devs in general is just always really strong. Games that give me nightmares included.
So yeah, I thought this looked really, really nice. The tile-based nature of it just seemed like it was something quite particular that I hadn't really seen before. So yeah, and it's not called the Arranger.
It's just called Arranger. And that's on me for not paying attention properly. A role-puzzling adventure.
It's got a demo in Steam Next Fest right now.
Yeah, oh really? Okay, cool. The problem with Steam Next Fest is it comes and goes so quickly.
And I don't have time to play all those demos because I'm trying to finish Dragon's Doctor II side quests. You know?
I think I have the wrong read on Steam Next Fest. To me, it just felt quite chaotic when they originally started doing them because it's just like there's loads of demos and then they seem to do so many versions of it throughout the year. It seemed that every two months there was a big Steam event where there were just loads and loads of demos, but then there are loads and loads of demos the rest of the year.
And, you know, it was just a classic chaotic Steam idea.
But it seems that actually there's loads of really awesome stuff and it's kind of a place like Rezzed and GDC is the sort of indie game discovery engine.
Apparently it's massive. You know, talking to people who make games and release games on there, it's like quite a key part of everything, you know, the release cycle. Now, I don't know whether it's, you know, simply because people who play demos, it then drives up the wishlist or if they download the demo, it like registers to the game to their account in a way, which is going to push it to them.
But like it's like the thing. Having Steam Next Fest success is like more important than any other PRB for a PC indie game.
Yeah, that's really interesting. I could see why. It's just like I always like reading the roundups of Steam Next Fest.
That's the thing. I don't end up playing the demos because it's over by the time I've noticed. It's really happening.
And then I just, you know, and there's always other stuff to play. But it is just nice seeing like these, a game you hadn't heard of like two weeks ago suddenly become a big deal when the eyes of some media outlets or some influencers, and then suddenly you see that snowball, you know.
It is, but it is also like sometimes it's a bit so self-fulfilling in that everyone just gets the demo of the thing they'd already heard of, you know. And it's like, how do you crack into that next layer? Because this is so much of it.
But I guess that's what, yeah. There's a couple of people at PC Gamer who always do like massive, massive lists of like 50 demos I played.
Yeah, absolutely. And do you know what is cool about Arranger as well? Is it's coming to Netflix via mobile.
So that seems perfect for a train journey kind of game. I hope it runs on my fucking rubbish Android phone. Oh, it must do.
We just watched Assassin's Creed Mirage being played on an iPhone. Like, anything's possible.
Anything's possible. I want to believe, certainly. I was browsing those games.
The Netflix games on there do seem to get stronger every time I look, but I see immortality on there and I can't play that on the train, dog. It's just not going to happen.
It's got to be a massive download, right?
You'd expect so, right? And then, yeah, it's just... Well, you know what I mean?
There's a guy next to me with a spreadsheet open and wearing a tie and I'm just there, sort of like, cross-checking breasts in Matthew Castle fashion.
Or a kid. If a kid ever sees someone playing on a phone, they assume that they're playing Clash of Clans or something that they like. And then they look at it and it's you kind of clicking on breasts.
Oh dear. I do feel bad that we brought immortality down to that one gag.
But that is part of it.
It is part of it.
You can't deny it.
No, I can't deny it. It's sort of like, but it's a shame because it's like, more games should have nudity in them really, but we're just clearly not mature enough to fucking...
We're the reason they don't do it.
Even us on this podcast, we're not mature enough to like, to appreciate nudity being part of the artistic mix of games. I was thinking the other day about how... Remember that guy just had his balls out in GTA Battle of the Gay Tony?
It was just like, it's just a naked guy, and they didn't say anything about it, but I don't know. Games should just do that more. There should just be naked characters.
It's part of movies and TV shows.
Do you think they were using that to prototype the testicle tech for Red Dead Redemption 2?
I don't want to talk about that again. It's just too grim. But okay, I enjoyed discussing that, Matthew.
And yeah, I guess like some of the other... There was quite a cool detective game that was in Day of the Devs. I thought you might look of with quite a distinctive art style, Matthew.
You had like a kind of word cloud. Do you know what I'm talking about?
It was quite late, so I was kind of dipping in and out of Day of the Devs.
Yeah, and I just wish I had it written down in my document and removed it. And now it's just... What an idiot, basically.
A detective game with a word cloud? I should... Well, whatever it is.
I mean, that sounds like my vibe, so I should dig it up. They showed off a bit of, not on Day of the Devs, but generally that Rise of the Golden Idol, the follow-up to Curse of the Golden Idol, which is quite interesting, sort of, rather than being sort of historic. Well, it's still historically set, but it's more modern.
It's set in the 70s, and they seem to have sort of simplified the interface of it a little bit. It's just very quick for them to have a sequel out, and that they've kind of riffed on it and sort of simplified it or streamlined it in some interesting ways. I'm curious to try that also in Steam Next Fest and see what the deal is.
Here's what I think is going to happen. You'll start playing Persona 3 Reload, then Steam Next Fest will be over. You'd have played none of these games.
I'll just play more Bellatro.
Bellatro. There's no need for any other games. That's the problem with Bellatro.
Okay. So the game was called Phoenix Springs anyway. Yeah, it was like a kind of neo-noir adventure.
It's like British sort of like voice actress in it. She sounded really good.
Oh, I did see that. It's got quite a striking art style. It's like big block colors.
It looks sort of like a cartoon was printed on a newspaper or something.
That's quite a good way of putting it. It's actually a really hard art style to describe.
Yeah, but it looks like ink printed on something.
Yeah, it looks like something you would find. It looks like something from about the 50s or 60s or something. Yeah, very distinctive art style.
But I thought that sounded like your sort of thing.
I mean, it's got Phoenix in the title. That's like one quarter of my favorite game title.
Oh, dear. And then she doesn't have an inventory in the game. She just collects thoughts and ideas.
Then you kind of connect them. It's like a big word cloud of stuff basically. You kind of make it work from there.
It just seemed interesting. It's coming out on PC in September anyway. I like the look of that.
That was good. Yeah, there are probably some. I quite like that one.
While Waiting looked pretty good. That game was just about being a bored kid waiting all the time. That's a big millennial experience.
I don't think it's possible for kids to be bored these days.
Catherine said she played that earlier in the year, maybe at whatever Easter Fest or whatever Steam called it, and said it's really, really good. You're trying to find a very simple interaction in these little dioramas, but the way you dig in and try and discover secrets and make things happen. Maybe a more fun version of Gorogoa.
Imagine Gorogoa, but it's fun.
Well, Gorogoa has felt fun when you worked out what the hell was going on.
But it's also a little bit Gorogoa, isn't it?
And yeah, that was the other thing that was obviously really stand out. And actually this was on my list and I seem to have deleted it and replaced it with Blockbusters, which is bad. But UFO 50 was really high on my list.
I don't know why I deleted that, to be honest. That's just a goof on my part.
That's high on my list.
Is it really? Okay, well, we'll come back to that then. But yeah, I like the look of that desperate game as well, that was at the Future Games Show.
It sort of looked like a new version of Rollerball or something, just running around this kind of environment and then nasty things can happen to your character. It looked pretty cool. It would really benefit if they could get it on PS Plus or Game Pass or something, because you just got that burst of people out of the gate.
But it looked quite specific a thing, as multiplayer experiences go. But that's enough of me pandering to Indies. It's back to all of my AAA stuff, so apologies.
Atomfall is my number eight, Matthew. The game from Rebellion at the Xbox conference, people described it as a bit Fallout-y, which I think is kind of true, but it's like British Fallout basically. And as I understand it, there's not many details out there about it, but today there was an Xbox blog that went into some detail on this.
It's set in 1957 in the Lake District, and there was a fire at a nuclear site, and in this world it's like speculative fiction, and it basically explores what happens in this local area after this sort of atomic plant emergency, and there's basically a kind of array of factions and cults and wicker man-y stuff going on in this. It's funny, because when the trailer started, I thought it was some kind of weird sci-fi version of Sniper Elite, because it's got army men in it and British and rebellion and stuff. I was like, OK, well, I assume it's Sniper Elite.
Ah, rebellion, I see. I see you put one and one together there.
So yeah, but then a robot turns up, and there's some slapping lads around with a cricket bat, and it just looked really fun. And I just thought, that's a cool thing to make, and it's a kind of setting and idea, and the fact it's in first person. Plus, it looked quite shiny.
It was like a good-looking, like a pretty high-budget sort of blockbuster. I know they've got a whole bunch of studios in the UK where they're making this stuff, and I thought it looked great, honestly. And I can't wait to learn more about it.
This is a game that didn't have a Steam page, as far as I could tell. But like I say, a few details on Xbox were about this. What did you think of this reveal, Matthew?
At first, I thought it was like, it looked a bit rat, because it's a similar place to, like, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
Britain, they call it.
Yeah, but a particular kind of, like, country pub. And also, because it had a slightly otherworldly, like, oh, something weird's going on here. Yeah, I am interested.
I'm not, like, hugely in love with any of Rebellion's, like, existing games. It's never quite done it for me. But, like, this is way more up my street than Zombie Army, or whatever it's called, and Sniper Elite.
So, yeah, that kind of strange Fallout-iness, I'm into it.
Yeah, it's like, it's kind of like a survival action game. It's not exactly a RPG, as you might expect, maybe, from, you know, from maybe your preconceptions of it being similar to other types of games or whatever.
I wonder if it's going to be a little bit like We Happy Few.
Oh, maybe. I think it's kind of like, I think it's a slightly more guided hand, because I wouldn't mind having a sort of narrative adventure in this setting, where you sort of, like, there's a beginning, middle and end, as opposed to the survival game thing of you play it forever kind of thing.
Yeah.
But maybe they'll do, maybe they'll do both. It did look like it had, you know, some quite pronounced lore in it, and they thought a lot about the setting. So that's out in 2025, and it will be on Game Pass as well.
So that's nice for everyone involved. What's your number seven, Matthew?
My number seven is Eric's Home, The Stolen Dream.
Which game is this?
This was a future game show. It's an isometric thing, looks like a little bit like Dishonored meets Desperados, in that it's kind of top-down isometric, but very high production values. It would kind of cut between very photorealistic characters in cutscenes, but then the actual gameplay camera was pulled quite far out, so you could see an entire sort of block of buildings and their rooftops, and there was a slightly Victorian-looking lady clambering around boxes.
Does this ring any bells?
I haven't seen the trailer for this one, unfortunately.
This looked really beautiful. An indie team called River End Games. I think they're all former DICE people.
I think there's like Mirror's Edge and Battlefield people, and they've kind of left, but they've done that thing that sometimes happens when you make indie from AAA studios, is that they still have like crazy production values.
It does look nice.
So it looks really expensive. I just like that isometric style. And I say Desperados whenever I see very photorealistic cities and buildings like that, you know, I'm instantly thinking of, yeah, like Desperado, Shadow Tactics, Shadow Gambit that they made.
And I don't think it is going to be like a real time tactics game, but it looks and from the description of it sounds like it's going to be a little bit like immersive simi. You have characters with different abilities, like the stealth element, there's like using the environment against people, like pushing stuff around, sort of physics-y stuff. I guess maybe like that weird West, but with slightly higher budget, or a slightly different aesthetic that looks more expensive to my eye.
Maybe risky putting something on here, which is really so vague outside of its trailer, but it does it for me. Like it just looks different. I like that perspective.
That's cool. I was curious what you made of Sumerian 6, which was not exactly the same thing.
I thought that looked like a rougher version of a Mimimi game.
Because I quite like the tone of it. As someone pointed out, it's a bit BPRD and sort of Hellboy-ish.
I was just curious to know what you made of it. I know some people will say, well, Mimimi took a lot of their learnings from Commandos and the original Desperados and whatnot back in the day. But I really feel like they kind of made that genre their own.
And I would like to, while I am keen to see more in it, there's something slightly off about it. But I'll definitely give it a go for sure.
I can't believe how shiny Eric's home looks. It's funny because the cutscenes are just so not what you expect from this sort of genre.
Well, that's the thing. Yeah, I don't really know how they've done that.
Well, that's just like, you said they're from DICE. I just assume they're interested in technology and making things look hot as fuck. Because, yeah, a very nice looking thing.
It's slightly Scandinavian. So there's a chance that old Geoff Keighley will turn up in it. A faint chance.
It's the slimmest of chances. But he's more likely to turn up in that than the other nine games on this list.
Well, as a man with many stolen dreams, I look forward to playing this game. Yeah, very nice trailer. Going straight on the wishlist.
And yeah, good pick, Matthew. So, again, I applaud you and the fact that you'll pick an indie game as long as it looks like it was made for like 90 million quid.
Oh, you've got to have graphics, man. Yeah.
I don't disagree. And yes, my next pick is a perfect dark Matthew. A reveal that I thought was amazing.
I do sort of like, I guess I should point out that I'm technically a contractor for Microsoft these days, so I just, you know, I won't say...
People know you're legit.
Do they? But they certainly heard me slagging off the stealth in Beyond Good and Evil on Monday without any hesitation. But that's a 21-year-old game.
That's fine. Yeah, perfect dark just really got the blood pumping. This was announced a few years ago.
This is, I think, a developer, the initiative at Microsoft and also Crystal Dynamics working on this. I think it was shrouded in some mystery because people didn't know how do you reboot Perfect Dark? There are only two games in this series, three, if you count the Game Boy Color one, which is actually very good.
But they, you know, they haven't made one since 2005. It was a launch game for the 360. How do you even...
What's happened in the first person shooter genre since then? Well, basically, like, Call of Duty happened. So many things have happened, right?
It's the entire online age. And what it seems I've gone with is a mix of a first person combat that draws from perfect darks like Arsenal, a varied, interesting weapons that do cool things, Titanfall slash Mirror's Edge style movement and wall running. So you've got like great sort of movement in there and a little bit of Deus Ex style immersive sim hacking in there as well and like abilities and things like that.
And that is an intoxicating combination. And I was very, very sold by this pitch for it. And to be honest, I didn't even really have it on my radar as a thing to, you know, a thing I was like invested in or really like was paying much attention to.
I was like, well, I thought maybe it would be an open world third person thing or something. I didn't know what would come out of it. But what came out of it is just like kind of the game of my dreams a little bit.
So I was just very, very impressed.
The game of your dreams is Zoukosis.
Yeah, we have established that quite literally. What do you think of this one, Matthew?
Saying what you expect from or what you want from A Perfect Dark is kind of tricky, because yes, I know there's two. There's only really one Perfect Dark, though. And that game was like the strange sequel to Goldeneye.
That's why everyone played it and loved it. Here are lots of elements from Perfect Dark that I liked, but I don't know if I'd necessarily be able to neatly pigeonhole it, which I think is reflected in this, in that it is like a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I mean, being in like a sort of city or a kind of domestic environment, they're being NPCs, like there was a little bit of that in Perfect Dark, like there were levels set in, you know, quote unquote, the streets of Chicago or whatever.
So I can kind of see where they've done a bit of that, like the Deus Ex thing, weirdly, like I've never kind of... It's only a short leap between the two, but I had never made that leap in my head. And I think that's what was most unusual about it, was like, oh yeah, it is kind of like that.
That actually makes a lot of sense. I do wonder if like knowing the fate of immersive sims and how they're kind of perceived more widely, like how deep they can really go into that kind of stuff. Like there were bits in that trailer where it looked like you were doing sort of Deus Ex-y kind of things.
But they also looked a little bit like the bits where you use gadgets in some Call of Duty campaigns. It could equally be that. So a big old question mark above this, but I think the thing that interested me most was just making you have a think about what is Perfect Dark and what is actually important to this and what do you need for it to have that title?
Because I saw some people being instantly very sniffy, like, well, this isn't like my Perfect Dark, and it's like, I fucking love that game, but I would struggle to really describe it in any way or like set out the rules of what I would want in a sequel. It certainly wasn't Perfect Dark Zero, that's for sure.
Yeah, that's the thing. It's like, well, you know, it's been so long, why not just open your mind to something quite fresh? And this felt like a very strong vision behind this.
Our guy, Joe Scrabble, so he only comes in this podcast now to talk about DuSaint, or maybe he'll come on to talk about Dragon's Dogma 2 at some point, but did an Xbox Wire post on this, and Team Perfect Dark wants to create a symphony of mechanics, merging, traversal, close-quarters combat, gunplay, unlockable abilities, environmental elements and gadgets into a unified experience. Immersive Sim, they are name-checked as an inspiration for the game. It's set in Cairo after an incident has impacted our near-future world, essentially.
And yeah, I thought there's a very strong vision behind this. It doesn't have a release date, but it was like... You just always need a few E3 trailers like this, you know what I mean?
Just things where you're like, it's far off, but it's ambitious, and it just gets the blood pumping in this very specific way. It just really did it, I think. It just felt like there was taste behind it, you know what I mean?
Definitely, and given that the only things you ever hear about this game are troubled development, it's fucked, blah blah blah. It's something with a bit of vision and a bit of direction, which it certainly wasn't up until this point, so that's exciting.
Absolutely. So Matthew, what's your number 6?
Claire Obscure Expedition 33.
I did like the look of this one, but it's not on my list.
There was a blog post about it on Xbox Wire, I think, which was explaining the concept. I don't know if you've read into this at all, but it's sort of set in this world where this sort of god emerges every year and writes a number on this monolith, which is the 33 that you see throughout the trailer. And basically everyone who is the same age as that number dies.
And so it's like a big kind of, I guess, lottery of like, we're going to kill off a generation of people every year. And this is about like a load of 33 year olds who see the 33 on the monolith and go, well, let's go and fuck up this person who's sentencing us all to death. So I like the idea of like loads of 33 year olds going, well, we better go and do this or like we are all screwed.
That's going to look for a game. I'm a little beyond 33, but I think back to, you know, life was in like relative turmoil when I was 33. And the idea of like going and just dishing out some pain on someone else seems quite good.
Was that a pandemic? Was it a 33?
It would have been like end of working on Xbox on. Say no more. A transition year.
Right, right, right.
Yeah, for me, it was like a big goddess emerged and wrote RPS on a monolith. And then I had to go and work for RPS. So that's how that worked.
It's got the combat system has like a crazy sort of persona, not like persona, but persona-esque, you know, it's a very hectic visual UI, which sort of moves all over the place and looks very kind of, I don't know what the art style is, that sort of art deco-ish thing going on. It has a big emphasis on quick, tiny event attacks and defenses. So like the Paper Mario thing basically, but in this very attractive 3D world.
They're talking that up as being quite a unique thing that no one's ever done. They're like, oh, it's got loads of real time elements to the turn-based combat. They call it a reactive turn-based system.
Whether or not it is more than like Press A to crouch when a Koopa Troopa kicks his shell at you or whatever, you know, yet to be seen, but I do like that model of RPG. And it has Ben Starr of Final Fantasy 16 doing the voice of the lead. And I always find him quite an agreeable voice in things.
Certainly a good looking man who pops up at industry events.
He's very good at selling that. I'm like sincerely like cross or in trouble here. I'm really cross about this situation.
I'm like, yeah, I'm into it.
Every time you like wears the Final Fantasy 8 shirt in public, I'm just like fucking well done dog. You know what I mean? I just want to give him a standing ovation.
I approve of that. Yeah, I thought this was actually a really cool, because I think it's from Kepler Interactive, right? It's one of their devs.
They're interesting, they're a collective of devs. A lot of stuff they've made so far has been quite unique in terms of the pitch of the game, with a very clear idea behind it. This has a very clear idea behind it.
There's a bit of a Logan's Run elements to the core of the story, right? But there's also this thing of its inspirations. They seem quite unusual.
Is it some kind of a period of French history, I believe, that's inspired it in terms of the visual?
I keep seeing this phrase, and I'm always scared to say it, because I think I'll say it wrong. Belle Epoche.
Yeah, which I know nothing about, but it's resulted in this very, very nice, very striking art style. I think a bunch of couple of stuff have just stood out in that respect, like CIFU, obviously, and Chia, a game which was slightly ruined by the Computer Game Show's Game of the Year episode last year, where it kept getting... It was kind of the subject of like, it was one of the games that didn't make it, and they talked about it over and over again, and now I can only ever associate that game with that podcast.
So that's tough. But yeah, it just looks like they spent a bunch of money on just a really precise idea. And yeah, it looks cool coming to Game Pass.
It looks pretty amazing as well. The landscapes looked beautiful and cutting edge.
Yeah, and also just love the idea of a blockbuster looking game having a turn-based combat system. That's just cool. Like just doing the JRPG thing.
That's awesome. So yeah, can't wait to see more of that. Yeah, I think that's a good pick, Matthew.
And if I could get my head around the story a bit more, maybe I would have picked it, but I felt a little bit head empty, no thoughts when I was looking at this. So yeah, that's tough for me. Okay, so we're at my number six, aren't we?
I have gone for a punt here on Dragon Age Veil Guard, Matthew, a game I've not seen in detail, but you have. But I did see the trailer at the Xbox Game Showcase, so happy that Dragon Age is back. The little bit I've seen was super, super good, but you have actually seen it, so why don't you tell me what you've seen of it?
You'll have seen this demo by the time we're listening to this podcast. I think it's the demo that they're going to show tomorrow. They're going quite heavy on you controlling this single hero, Rook, who you make as you do in Dragon Age.
You make your character. The combat looks a bit more real time than Inquisition in terms of positioning and timing of attacks. It looks quite nimble.
I think in the demo we saw they were playing as a rogue, so it was all very up close and quick attacks. But then you can also dip into a tactical menu to give instructions to your companions. The way the tactical menu came up reminded me more of giving instructions in Mass Effect than previous Dragon Ages.
It seemed very consolified, very quick moving, which I liked really. I mean, this is a really basic bitch take. I thought it looked pretty amazing.
Given that some people were like, about the trailer, because it had quite an impressionistic, cartoony style, the actual game itself is pretty cutting edge and reminds you that they've got amazing environmental artists. I always thought Dragon Age Inquisition had some like, absolutely amazing world design in it. And it's kind of that, you know, massive looming sky boxes and like crazy weather effects going on.
Like really good lighting. Apparently they've talked that up quite a lot when they've been showing it at Summer Game Fest, going like, you know, a lot of what looks good in this game is the lighting kind of punching above its weight. Look, really fast moving.
If you're into those characters, if you've played Dragon Age Inquisition in particular, like it looks like it looks like a direct sequel in terms of who's there and what they're dealing with and what the threat is. Already just in a 20 minute section, some quite big fan service. And even though you have got this big focus on, you know, controlling your character in real time and them being, you know, you and you having a more direct kind of, you know, they're not feeling like a distant abstract, like jumble of stats.
That doesn't mean the companions aren't really important. And I think the companions, you know, they showed off in that trailer do look really cool. Like, you know, I like their backgrounds, the ideas of them.
I think it's quite funny that that little kind of helper kind of halfling, is it Harding from Inquisition is now a full, full companion. Again, troubled development. You're expecting something quite cobbled together and like rescued.
Yeah.
That isn't what this is. This looks quite assured to me.
Yeah, I don't know. So that's a problem with like, you know, paying too much attention to those kinds of reports is that if the game ends up being good, that is kind of the only thing that matters. And this has been such a long time in development.
And I think everyone, everyone has an appetite to see Bioware do well again, right? Everyone wants that to happen. They want that big comeback narrative, you know, just like 10 years since they made the last game that most people can agree this was great.
And this is a developer at their peak. So it's a long, long time. And, you know, I think that it's sort of like people seemed to have some mixed opinions on the reveal trailer, but I was there thinking, well, this is them marketing the companions.
This is them saying the companions really matter here because probably off the back of Mass Effect Andromeda, they were like, we knew we didn't get that part of the game quite right. So this time it's really important that you know these people matter and you will like them. And so I kind of got where they went with that approach.
And then the tiny snapshot of gameplay I saw was the most next-gen as fuck looking thing. Big floating city thing in the sky. Just look really, really nice, really sharp.
And you know, that's great because yeah, when they're making a comeback like this, it's a world that has Baldur's Gate 3 in it. You want to show a bit of blockbuster heft, I think.
Yeah, I think you can definitely see the kind of the through line from Inquisition to this in terms of like how the world's structured in at least in this little demo, which I think is like literally the opening of the game. I think that's what it is.
God damn. Well, I can't wait to play this. And I think you and I will probably do at least one Dragon Age podcast this year, Matthew, maybe two, maybe one about the series and like a two giant men play.
Should we do that? That might be good.
Yeah, that'd be good.
Yeah. All right, we'll do that then. So was that my number six?
I think it was. And it's your number five now, isn't it?
My number five is probably an unexpected pick for me, but I watched a video of it today where it suddenly went massively up in my estimations. It's Phantom Blade Zero.
Oh, is this a Souls-like game?
It isn't. You see, this is why it went up in my estimations. I thought it looked Souls-like-y as hell.
Like it's one of the 10 billion quite flashy looking samurai sword games that's being made by a... And this can sound like a horrible generalization, but it's true. Chinese or Korean studio.
There's a lot of these games about. Like that PlayStation state of play had like three or four of them in the course of like 40 minutes. This was one of them.
What I think it actually is closer to is Metal Gear Rising.
Okay, keep talking.
Based on like they are like, oh, it's a character action game. Like it's a Souls-like world structure, but the combat is like the combat of a Devil May Cry or a Platinum game. All of a sudden that unlocks my interest in all the crazy boss designs and the really striking art design.
Because whenever I see this stuff in the trailers, I'm like, oh, this is really nice, but I won't see any of it because I fucking blow at this kind of game. But when they're like, oh, there's all this, and the thing you need to be able to play is a basic grasp of like combos in a fighting game and a little bit of that kind of dexterity, that opens up the whole thing for me. And all of a sudden I was like, I'm into that.
I'm excited for that. I mean, in a similar way, Stella Blade kind of straddled that line, I guess.
Yeah, yeah, quite successfully.
Like, it wasn't quite one or the other. It had elements of both.
Yeah.
This has that too. So why shouldn't I be excited for the grim, dark fantasy world for once? I may actually make it past hour one.
Yeah, I can't say I remember what this game is, but I do think it was quite funny. The only real gripe that you and I shared about this whole period was the number of soul slikes. We were both like, that's too many now.
There's just far, far too many. Like, I just can't. And I don't really want to play any of them, if I'm being honest.
Obviously, it's not really my genre, but there are just so many of them. And that's the thing. This is why I think the game you're talking about, the name of which I've already forgotten, Phantom Blade Zero, is appealing because I just always think that if you're making a soul-slike game, why not shift 10% this way or 10% that way?
You suddenly veer into a genre that I'm interested in. You veer into Devil May Cry or, like you say, a Platinum game, you get slightly more towards something that I find more palatable. Now, I know that, I'm sure many of our listeners, you probably can't get enough of these kind of games, right?
But I think with everything, you reach some kind of critical mass of what you can reasonably consume, and surely that genre is nearing a number of games where you can't actually play every single one that comes out. There's just so many of them.
I also worry that even when one comes along, which is by all accounts rock solid, like Lies of P, which is reasonably well thought of, everyone is still like, yeah, I mean, it's good, but it's a slightly bad, worse Bloodborne, or a slightly worse this. These games are just forever stuck in the shadow of a group of people who happen to have mastered them. The idea of some up-and-comer overtaking from software, it's just very unlikely.
I just feel like you're in a kind of hiding to nothing with this genre. You're always going to be playing lesser versions of the thing that you fell in love with. But like I said, I don't play it, so maybe that's bullshit.
That's my read from afar.
No, I get what you mean. It's tough to move into a genre where there are masters of that genre, and they are pretty frequently putting out games that everyone says are 10 out of 10. I guess it's that thing where if it's so popular a genre that Elden Ring sells 20 million copies, if you can even approximate that, then maybe it is worth it alone.
The thing is, if you have a wave of developers you've never heard of who are suddenly making this kind of game, and they're doing so with quite good production values, even if they get most of the way there, you just wonder, the second or third games could be really, really great, so in that way I try and see it as the positive side of that is, you might just end up with a bunch of, maybe this is the first generation of these developers making something, but then maybe next time they make something slightly more distinctive or even closer in quality to some of the From games. That's like the optimistic way of looking at it, Matthew, but I'll keep this on my radar anyway. Okay, my number five.
I don't imagine this will be on your list. Star Wars Outlaws. Is this on your list?
It isn't.
No. So there was just a big showcase of this in the Ubisoft Forward presentation, as you might expect. It was teased on Friday with an absolutely baller bit of footage in the Geoff Keighley show of just lots of Star Wars planets and action and iconography and things you'll get excited about back to back.
And when they showed it on the Ubisoft presentation, it honestly looked like a very polished version of a familiar type of game. There wasn't necessarily anything new in there. That's not true, actually.
The thing that's new in there is the seamless spaceship travel between planets. The fact that you get in a spaceship, go into space, then go to another planet and then land, and it just all happens in real time. Very, very impressive in that respect.
But in terms of the amount of money it looks like is spent on it, it is such an extravagant looking game. And if you like Star Wars, it's taking so many boxes of what I think you would want from someone who asks the question, what should the first Star Wars open world game be? And it's like there's Jawa Sandcrawlers when you're driving a little speeder bike across Tatooine, that sort of thing.
You can literally land in Mos Eisley. There's obviously Jabba the Hutt people knew about and his little pal Salacious Beakrum. You encounter all these different characters from the Star Wars universe, but you're not necessarily part of the overarching story, but maybe you'll meet Lando at a Sabacc table or whatever.
And there's just so much going on in it. It just looks like it's such a bit like an army of developers made this. It looks like such a mammoth undertaking.
It's out in August as something that's just like within our grasp. I was really excited by this. And even if like all the parts look really familiar together, it just seems like such a great pitch for a Ubisoft open world game.
Like it just has all the right pieces in place. What did you think of this one?
Yeah, I can see all that. I think the thing that interests me the most is that, you know, it looks like it's going to have a lot of the Ubisoft open world framing to it. But crucially, I think it also has the fidelity to like dial in and do like a just a third person action set piece, which some people have likened to Uncharted, that there are Uncharted style action set pieces in this or like platforming, big cinematic platforming.
And that flavor, that kind of specificity and fidelity, you don't tend to get in open world games. You know, the trade off for scale is that everything is slightly more generalized as a result. And if it can shift between those two modes, you know, I'm definitely into that.
That's a style of game I like. I like lots of stuff exploding. I like running through amazing environments, which aren't just the same templated rooms over and over again, which is something you can do when you have this many Ubisoft people at your disposal.
And the trailer does look like that. It looks like it's going to be, you know, just like every environment is so packed with like weird props and bits of furniture that you haven't seen in any other shot of the game. And yeah, it's really impressive.
It just looks like a step up in that level of detail from like an Assassin's Creed, say. I'm not a Star Wars guy, but even I can see that it's tapping into the funnier of Star Wars that everyone likes, you know, there's Lando, there's Jabba, there's a hand solo in Frozen in his little box or whatever. And that's fun.
That's what people want. You're going to get to do like an uncharted set piece around the Sarlacc pit or whatever. And you're like, yeah, of course.
Yeah, I'm into that.
Yeah, just yeah, absolutely. Like it ticks off some, yeah, some key bits of Star Wars lore without being, without it being too over the top. There's like five planets in this and one is Tatooine, but the rest look like they're specific to this game.
And so, you know, that will give the artists some, you know, some real, you know, real space to flex their muscles, I guess. And yeah, I think it's I think what you say about the idea of uncharted style set pieces within the game. That was kind of what Jedi Survivor did well, wasn't it?
It had those scripted moments when you really needed them. And yeah, they really have a place. And so, yeah, yeah, I hope that it's able to pull that off.
It's a very ambitious looking thing. I kind of like it's I think as well if it's if it's really good and they just do the Ubisoft thing of like you get two years worth of new stuff they keep adding to it. That's got a lot of potential.
Star Wars just feels like the kind of world that could create that kind of interest in people. And, you know, it's it's serious business. Like I say, it looks absolutely monster budget.
So fingers crossed, because that's the other thing with Jedi Survivor, right? Is that little canteen cafeteria area you go into the little bar is a really cool space. And this seems to be this game seems to be suggesting that there are loads and loads of spaces like that to see where specific NPCs are doing little bits and pieces or there's loads of character to the settings.
So, yeah, can't wait out on August 30th.
I mean, baby, let's see how that enthusiasm holds up when we hit season 12. Return of Babu Frick.
Please be able to bring this background to Babu Frick. So what's the number four?
It's the only Star Wars character I can name. I can remember.
Well, there's Jynrod Dolmax, of course.
Yeah.
Let's save him for year five.
My number four is Monster Hunter Wilds. Not on my list. I just hailed a load of fluff from the pillows that line my coffee table, audio booth.
I think you've got to keep that in the podcast. Yeah. It's pretty funny.
Monster Hunter Wilds, I tend to play about 30 to 40 hours of the big Monster Hunters when they come along, which is nothing. I never even finish the campaigns of these things. I made a better dent on the 3DS ones when I reviewed them back in the day, but these are monster games that are just very hard to keep on top of.
The last couple, they've been pushing more into the classic Monster Hunter action as it is, but with a bit more single player framing and adventurous stuff around the edges to make it maybe a bit more palatable to newcomers. This is them taking the big play spaces of World and Rise and blowing it out into massive ecosystems where the environment can change in radical ways, like the weather systems. Apparently every environment in this game has a chill season and a chaos season where all storms whip up and all the monsters go apeshit.
Different monsters appear in different cycles of each world, so there's reason to really explore them in both. They're going big on the animal ecosystems. There are now big monsters that hunt in packs, so rather than just fighting one of these things, there's 20 of them rampaging together.
I just thought it looked really impressive when all these mad bastards were charging around and then another monster would come out the sand and they'd all smash into him or a load of even smaller pack hunter-type creatures would all clamber over a big monster. I love all the monster-on-monster stuff and it feels like they've really gone beyond here's one big monster fighting another big monster into the realms of what happens when just loads of these freaks collide into each other. Throw in some environmental takedowns as you drop huge stalactites on things' heads and all this kind of stuff.
It looked really fun, really polished. Rise was very jolly and all, but it didn't necessarily have the immense wow factor of being made for Nintendo hardware first, so making something very shiny for PS5 and Xbox. I thought it looked really great and just a really interesting journey these games have been on in terms of nailing their hardcore credentials and never really losing sight of those, but installing them in flashier, frothier games, but without losing sight of the values that keep the hardcore playing.
I like so many of the Capcom teams, I just think they really know what they're doing.
The world around Monster Hunter warmed up to its complexity. That's the interesting thing about it, right? Looking as good as it does, like you say, that's a great way to get people through the door.
I've never really had a proper Monster Hunter experience. I did buy World and I didn't play it, and people I knew who were playing it were done by the time I got to it. So this time, I'm trying to embrace the types of games I've missed over the years and get into them.
I've cracked Dragon's Dog, Matthew, I've done that.
I think that feels like a bit of a gateway drug to this.
Yeah, I think so. Giant monsters in a Capcom game, there's definitely some DNA there.
And idiosyncratic, some sort of bullshit elements in the controls and interface.
Yeah, I mean, I hope it has some baffling side quests in the way that Dragon's Dog War 2 does, where I'm like, I cannot believe I have to wait for this beggar to stand at a bar for like eight hours or whatever. But yeah, I look forward to it. And yeah, it was very...
Maybe this is like a low-key highlight of it. Maybe Monster Hunter is just slightly invisible to me now because it's been around for so long. But yeah, this was one of the big reveals of the Summer Jeffers, wasn't it?
So yeah, I will join you on the fields of wherever this game is set. And yes, I will renew my PS Plus subscription to play this with you for one month. And it'll be good.
We'll have a good time. Okay, Matthew, good pick.
Yeah, it sounds great.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so my number four is Astrobot. Is this on your list?
It's my number three, so let's talk about it.
Perfect, yeah. So long-awaited full game based on the Astro's Playroom. Freebee that came with the PlayStation 5 at launch, everyone played it, agreed it was great, showed off what the PS5 controller in particular could do, but in general, everyone just agreed it was an amazing thing to behold, a great celebration of PlayStation history, and I think for a long time people were like, well, why don't they make a full thing of this and a full game, a full 3D platformer experience?
And that's exactly what was announced at the PlayStation livestream shortly before Summer Game Fest kicked off. And yeah, it kind of looks like the game that everyone was expecting, really. It's just a wide variety of levels.
They say more than 50 planets, which I would assume were all levels, but it just looked like a broad mix of delightful 3D platforming in a year that doesn't appear to have any Nintendo 3D platformers to play and enjoy. And I think everyone agreed that Astro's Playroom was of a very high quality. And it seems like the appetite for this was enormous.
It's much bigger than I thought it would be, Matthew, because when you look at the Amazon top sellers charts, this is like in the top five on pre-orders already coming out in September. People are really up for it. I think in general when it comes to playing anything like this now, where I think it's in a slightly Mario-ish vein, I'm just there thinking the ideas that it has, how could it clobber me over the head with amazing variety and wonderful things to behold?
The trailer was very much in the compilation mold of showing you a whole array of those ideas. It seems like that is the approach they have taken. It's just a 3D platforming designed to wow and delight you.
What did you think of this one, Matthew?
At its heart, maybe not the most adventurous platformer, in terms of what Astro Bot himself can do. He isn't like Marion, he's much simpler. But what he does is rock solid.
He's really responsive. The levels are really well designed around him. He transforms by putting on suits and gadgets and getting little gizmos.
The trailer was full of that stuff. You can just tell sometimes looking at a clip of something that it's going to feel tactile and lovely in the hands. Boxing gloves pinging out on springs and mad splashing water everywhere.
You know in Playroom, they had all that DualSense stuff. It's probably still the best DualSense game as a tech demo. So the idea of a whole game of that was a bit in the trailer where he's walking through a load of tin cans.
I just know those tin cans are going to feel crazy on that pad. So I come into that. I can't wait to feel what it feels like to walk through tin cans.
Got to be interested, as for me. So I think there's that side of it. I also think he is their mascot, right?
Like, he's kind of replaced... What's their mascot? Sackboy?
Is that fair to say?
I guess that was a thing that was, you know, touted for a while.
And it feels like Sackboy's kind of done now.
Yeah.
Astrobot's whole deal is very similar to Sackboy, in that he's quite a nondescript thing, who dresses up as other PlayStation characters. But it just fits him better. I like the very small changes, just like putting on the hat and he's the guy from Bloodborne, or giving him a little tail and then he suddenly ratchet or whatever.
Your favourite.
There's something minimalist and kind of clean about it, which I think really suits a mascot. And I actually respond really well to that stuff. I actually really like the way they lean into the history and heritage.
Some people are a little sniffy about it. They're like, why do you need all this bullshit? Why can't it just be this good platformer with good ideas?
It could be both. Yeah, and they have got a heritage. They've been around long enough.
I just don't think you can be down on that and then pro Smash Brothers, say. Both companies have the right to celebrate themselves. I like that he celebrates hardware.
I like that he's kind of like a half character, half hardware thing. So it makes sense that in his world, he kind of hangs out with PlayStation multi-taps and things like that. That makes sense.
He's friend to both Clank and Crash Bandicoot.
Clank is your favorite, as seen in Secret Agent Clank on PSP. Yeah, I agree with all of that pretty much. I think if you are kind of worried that it's just a fan service overload of PlayStation, then the trailer's got a nice mix of both, really.
You do have a lot of cameos from even games like Journey, for example. Then it's just like he's flying across lava for a bit, or he's in a casino level and stuff. You're like, well, this is like 3D platformer 101 for delightful levels.
I think it will be a good time. Yeah, I think he's an easier sell, too. In some ways, it feels quite a bit like the Eve character in Wall-E, right?
That's the germ of it a little bit. But I don't know. Listeners of this podcast, they know what we're about.
There's a bit at the end of this trailer where some little robot lads take off into space on a PlayStation 3. I mean, what do you want from me?
This is hugely significant. So yeah, September 6th, I look forward to playing it, Matthew. Should be a good one.
What's your number three? Oh, well, that was your number three, wasn't it? Then we come to your number nine, which is Metal Gear Solid Delta.
Snake Eater, is that what it's called? Confusing name.
That was my number 10.
Number 10, okay. So yes, you made such a good point about this trailer, which is the trailer lacks the panache of a Hideo Kojima trailer. And it was such a good point.
And once you pointed it out, it didn't ruin the trailer, but it did recontextualize in my head of like, oh, of course, you're right. This would be such a maximalist, nonsensical eight minute thing if Kojima had made it. And obviously this is Konami remaking Metal Gear Solid 3 without Kojima's input.
And it looks fantastic, I think. It does look like in some ways a very, very shiny shell on what Metal Gear Solid 3 already is. But I would also argue it is a pretty great game.
They'll no doubt improve the sort of shooting and the combat and all that kind of stuff. And it was just a really sort of striking, cool bit of nostalgic fan service. And I don't know if there's much more to it than that, Matthew.
Have you gleaned any further details on this one?
No, there's this thing doing the rounds, like on their official website they talk about. Obviously it's got traditional controls and modern controls, which you'd think would be a lot more closer to like Phantom Pain, say. But you can switch between that kind of over-the-shoulder third-person camera and like the legacy camera as well.
So you can play this whole game basically from the perspective and with the controls of the original. But I'm way more interested, like one of the reasons I want to play this game is, you know, I replayed it, you know, in the last couple of years, and it was idiosyncratic, to be generous. The idea of getting to experience one of the best stealth adventure games of all time in a slightly more agreeable, slightly prettier way.
That sounds great as a pitch. They've added a thing as well where apparently like every wound he takes like remains on his body forever.
Oh, interesting. Yeah, I think I did see this. Yeah.
So even once you've healed him up, he's covered in... So like by the end of the game, he'll be like scarred to shit if he didn't play very well.
Damn. And he definitely will be in my playthrough.
Yeah.
He'll be covered in fucking bee stings by the end of my playthrough.
He's just got an entire beehive on his head for like the last 10 hours of the game.
Yeah, it's quite interesting how they've sort of pitched it. Like you say, it says like the third person view is new. I mean, there was a good third person camera in the subsistence version of 3, but this has the over the shoulder aiming that will no doubt make the game quite simple to play in some ways.
But yeah, I don't know. It's like it's a proper Unreal Engine 5 tech showcase this game. Just the foliage looks great.
And I kind of like the idea of a game has permission to not be fucking vast and like 80 hours long because it's a remake of something else. And yet it can still be very shiny and blockbuster. I like that.
And yeah, like you, I just what's wrong with having a definitive version of something that we all agree is an all time classic. So, yeah, I realize it's maybe not the most sort of like creative choice to pick my second remake on this list. But what can I say?
It looked pretty shiny. What's your number two, Matthew?
My number two is UFO 50.
Nice.
I know this has been around for ages and I'd obviously heard about the idea and Catherine had told me about it, but it hadn't quite like registered just the goofiness of the idea, which for people who don't know, a group of developers have made a selection of games for a sort of fictional gaming company, sort of 80s era gaming company called UFOsoft or something. And it's almost like, you know, you get those anthologies, which are like 50 Atari classics. It's that, but for this fictional games machine and games company, but they've treated it really seriously.
All these different developers have made different games in different genres, but they've all adhered to the rules of like, well, what was the power of the fictional machine? What was its color palette? So they all look like they should feasibly exist in the same thing, but also it represents a 10 year period of this console.
So you'll see the games get more sophisticated as people master the machine. So it's like a fake historic journey through this fake console. They say the games range from like very basic kind of arcade like one hit, you know, high score challenges to sort of entire kind of JRPGs.
There are multiplayer games. There's just loads going on in here. Retro looking but made with like a modern sensibility.
People could make games with the conventions of modern day games. They didn't have to like rewind the thinking to 1980. I just think it looks great, you know, like a just this huge anthology of like mad, wonderful bullshit.
I don't know why. I hope this hadn't sort of excited me before or gotten my radar before. But now it is like firmly on there and it's only like a couple of months away.
I completely agree. One thing I will point out. I just realized why this wasn't on my list.
I had Perfect Dark on there twice and I looked at my Google document history and this was at my number two before I put the second Perfect Dark there. Therefore, I'm calling this my number two as well. Convenient, isn't it?
I was watching Dare the Devils and I think I messaged you about this. I think you were either nonplussed or you weren't paying attention or something. But this is clearly the indie highlight of the entire Jude announcement period.
This is such a legit looking thing. All of the games look so complete and they have set themselves these limitations of what you could achieve with 8-bit games from the 80s, so like a 32-color palette, that sort of thing. At the same time, they have modern sensibilities of how some of these games are made.
You mentioned the JRPG. I can't imagine the idea of booting up this compilation and playing one JRPG within that. It's so abstract.
I was saying to you, it has the feeling of when I bought my fucking Dreamcast off of that guy on eBay.
Right.
And it's just suddenly this massive archive of games I've never played. The idea of a game that captures that specific vibe is really impressive. Was it years ago?
This was in an Edge magazine, Matthew.
Yeah, and it's on their cover recently, but I think it's been around for five, six years.
Yeah, I think maybe pre-pandemic I remember reading about this and thinking, wow, that sounds amazing, and sort of knowing the credentials behind it. And then, yeah, just it fell off the radar for ages. And then I don't know sort of like what...
I guess they were just making all of these fucking games for this thing that whole time. And then the fact that a bunch of them are sort of like multiplayer as well, it just seems so well thought out. And man, I can't wait.
That is like an absolute day one purchase. I can't wait to play that. Is it just on PC this or is it on console as well?
Yeah, I think they only mentioned Steam in Day of the Devs.
Yeah, so I guess I'll play on Steam Deck. Obviously on Switch this would be, you know, monumentally popular, I imagine. But yeah, really, really good.
Can't wait. Yeah, fantastic showing. And yeah, just made me just really put a genuine smile on my face watching it, like watching them browse the menus and just seeing the sheer variety of games.
I was like, fucking well done. That's the magic of games right there. Well done, sir.
Okay, what's your number one, Matthew?
My number one is Doom the Dark Ages. Which I come in with the disclaimer that obviously Samuel is involved with Bethesda as a contractor, so I cannot offer his thoughts on this.
I will simply mute myself and wish you well.
No, I thought this looked really fab. We haven't really got to the era of Doom and Doom Eternal in our Game of the Year episodes.
I think we got to 2016.
Have we done that?
I think Doom 2016 came up in one of those ones we did.
Okay, well, we definitely even got into the era of Doom Eternal, which I absolutely loved, one of my favorites from the last ten years. I've been intrigued at how that team was going to develop it and where they could go next, because I really felt like they'd taken the kind of things that they were heading towards in Doom and just sort of saw them to their kind of natural conclusion, really. And it feels like from looking at this game and reading a brief interview with one of the developers today that they have gone in a very different direction.
The guy whose name escapes me is Hugo something.
Martin.
Hugo Martin, thank you, who I interviewed weirdly for like a Spanish games festival during lockdown in a very awkward interview where I sat in my living room, didn't really know what I was doing, but I'll let people discover that on YouTube. Here's this whole spiel about like, we go back to the original Doom whenever we start on these projects and kind of drill into like, what makes this this? And this time, the thing that they're really interested in is the kind of like the dance of death between the Doom Slayer and projectiles, because they're like, obviously, the original games aren't very vertical, not vertical at all, they're, you know, all about horizontal movement and dodging stuff.
And that seems to be the kind of idea at the heart of this, you know, it's this sort of prequel, like medieval fantasy setting. But what that actually is an invitation for is like this sort of heavier tank-like Doom Slayer, and it's going to be a lot more... It feels like they're trying to channel the energy of the original Doom a lot more into this, which you, you know, in your head, you're like, well, that's what Doom and Doom Eternal do anyway.
It's not. They take the idea and kind of like amplify it and turn it into something else. This is actually like a genuine effort to kind of like, how do you move, how do you think about original Doom and what would that look like in a modern setting?
And that to me is hugely compelling. I mean, like, when you watch the trailer, you'll see it. Like, he's weaving in and out of bullets.
Like, a lot of the enemy attacks seem to be about, like, waves of things coming towards you. It's all very horizontal. I think that looks super interesting.
But then on top of it, it just has that, like, best-in-class, like, fantasy mad metal design thing going on. Like, the weapons look fantastic. He's armed permanently with like a shield, which is like a chainsaw shield.
Rev it up and, like, use it as a weapon, but also deflect and parry and throw it around. It suggests it will be used for puzzles and things. He's got a big gun which sort of mulches skulls and then fire the skulls out as bullets, which is fucking brilliant.
Yeah, it's not at all what I thought they would do with Doom. You know, often when you can't see the obvious answer, it's just really interesting when much smarter people come up with it and you're like, oh, of course, this makes total sense. Out in 2025, so this is the trailer, so I am just extremely all in on this and apologize for making it awkward for Samuel.
No, it's fine. Not at all. All I'll say is when I saw this trailer, I just went, dog, that is computer games right there.
Right.
That's exactly it. You just know it's going to be incredibly fun to play and look amazing. It just looks amazing already.
So yes, I am excited. 2025 is a winner. A winner already.
Exciting stuff. Okay. Good.
I think we navigated that without much awkwardness, Matthew. Okay. So my number one is the game that people have decided to call metaphor because no one can say the second word in the title, re-Fantazio.
We still don't know how that's really said. In building the most anticipated games of the year, I think this is an interesting one in the sense that they had a new trailer to show at the Summer Jeff Fest, and they brought the devs on, the Persona team devs. And there was, I would say, like, awed hush in the audience.
They couldn't believe their luck. They couldn't believe that they were seeing the geniuses behind Persona 5 on stage. And then I think the funny thing is, this is actually like, I think this has proven quite a hard game for journalists to get their arms around, like why it's really exciting, like what's great about it.
And I think that's honestly because people will just need it in the hands for hours and hours before they really grasp it. But reading about it, like people obviously wowed by the UI elements, as you know, that's always dazzling a persona. But it sounds like there's quite a deep class system in it with these kind of archetypes that give maybe a slightly more depth to the combat you typically got in persona when you were chopping and changing the different personas.
So that's kind of interesting. But in general, it's just a mix of, you know, high budget Japanese RPG, similar social link kind of stuff and relationships building between your different characters, and the obvious sense that this is going to be a total banger when it comes out. So it just has to be number one on my list because I'm just mega, mega confident about it.
Even if, like, I'm not sure I learn loads more every time I see a new trailer. I'm just a bit more like, get this in my hands every time I see it. Is that how you feel when you see it too?
Yeah, I think so. The only reason it didn't make my list is it just sort of feels like a sure thing. Also, like you say, it's kind of...
The specifics of each showing are maybe a little confusing, some of the terminology, but I just know it's going to be amazing and I have full faith in it. So, yeah, it's like a given. Of course, it'll be great.
And it seems so soon, you know, these are games which traditionally come out in Japan, then you have to wait what feels like eight billion years for them. So that's cool, like we've got that kind of parity now. Yeah, I mean, God, it is going to be an all-time review.
Yeah, it's just like, it's just really stacking up, isn't it? Just, yeah, an absolute pile of things to look forward to at the end of the year. There's still plenty more I liked besides in the showcases we haven't talked about, Matthew, like the outer sloth games they revealed at the Summer Jeff Fest.
All are pretty cool, that the inner sloth developers are basically funding, which is nice to see. And the Blumhouse game stuff, that former guest of the podcast and very successful video games professional Louise Blaine is working on. They look really good, like a bunch of horror games from Blumhouse.
So, yep, that was cool too. And probably a bunch of other indie games I'm forgetting about. Is there anything else you want to name check, Matthew?
There's the promise in that Blumhouse stuff that Sam Barlow is making a game with Brandon Kronenberg, which you just know is going to be fucking evil. So, there's that to look forward to. That guy's films are like...
I mean, I say hard work in the best possible way, but...
I've not seen them is Infinity Pool. I heard it was pretty good though, quite out there and horrible.
Not quite as nightmarish as Possessor, but he likes fucking up really handsome people.
So, I like about Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd though. He'll turn up for any auteur. He's just there.
He's not a baby. It's because his dad's like a freak.
He has to be a freak too. Or his dad. He'll disappoint his dad.
Yes, very good. So, yeah, I enjoyed that. I thought it was a very solid crop of live streams this year.
I thought there was plenty I wanted to play. I found that games are actually in pretty good shape in terms of the stuff you can play, even if obviously it's been a very dicey, horrible year for layoffs and such. But the actual sort of like what things are making, as good as ever, really, lots to look forward to.
So, yes, in a genuine sense, I wish everyone well who's working on a computer game. What a great way to sign up.
Unlike, not in the listeners.
No, the listeners, that's an altogether different sensation. So Matthew, the podcast is done. Where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzle underscore pesto on Twitter, and I am Mitt... I am MrBazzlePesto, no underscore on blue sky.
MittBazzlePesto.
I don't know what's going on there.
MittBazzlePesto is a phrase you read in a German recipe book, I think. Okay, the podcast is patreon.com back page pod. If you'd like to support us financially, get two extra podcasts.
Hear me and Matthew complaining slightly about Beyond Good and Evil, which we played in the first listener-voted Two Giant Men play episode. We're going to do a second vote in July for August episodes. So we're going to keep doing these, basically, letting the listeners decide from a short list of games that we pick, like what we should do an episode on.
And they'll generally be games that we haven't played before. So you get fresh experiences from us, that kind of thing, and should be good. Also, the second episode of our film club this month on the XL tier and some fun stuff coming next month.
The limited run draft, where me and Matthew have to draft 10 games and pick 10 ridiculous items to go with them. It's a high chance of chaos, if that sounds good to you. Â£4.50 XL tier.
Please enjoy. And the podcast is twitter.com/backpagepod, if you'd like to follow us on there. Same on Blue Sky when I can remember to post.
And I'm Samuel W. Roberts. Matthew, let's get out of here.
Goodbye.
