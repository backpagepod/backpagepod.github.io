Hello and welcome to the Backpage XL, a patron exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.

Matthew
00:33
Hello.

Samuel
00:33
Hello, Matthew. Welcome to the Christmas themed episode of the backpage. Get yourself a little glass of Prosecco at the entrance and uh come in to the uh cheap venue that we've rented. We're we're in uh Las Iguanas in um in Boston. Just no just the bar area. Okay. Um there are some wine girlies over there who are from Lloyd's T S B or something, but um you know that's that's fine. Raise a glass of prosecco towards them and try and look cool. They turned around and left immediately, which is rough. Help yourself to some uh yeah to half a half a chicken and his imaginary parties are terrible sorry it's a maybe a bit too real there um for the two of us but uh yes um it is a Christmas themed episode of the podcast it is daft It's a little bit of substance married to something completely throwaway. But people seem to quite enjoy it last year, Matthew. Basically a pantomime that we filled with video game characters. We've done that again. And um a bit of Christmas chatter really, um, just to sort of get you in the mood. Um I was curious, Matthew, do you ever listen to Christmas music? Have you ever have you put anything on this year? Is that something you ever seek out? Yeah, I love Christmas music.

Matthew
01:44
Really? Yeah, yeah, I absolutely love it. Because it's like the canon has been the same since I was a child and so the same bangers come around every year and it just takes me back every single time. Like very very few things have been added to what I consider the classic Christmas canon and yeah I will I will happily listen to that stuff. I really look forward to it. Basically I'm like let's get the Christmas music on the second Halloween's done.

Samuel
02:11
Wow, I did not expect that. As ever, you and music, I just never know where you're gonna go with it.

Matthew
02:17
'Cause like you know we'd have we'd have the same CD, like now that's what I call Christmas or whatever. from when I was like eight and that would just be played in the house all the time and yeah I love that stuff. It's then it's fun. The the good tunes.

Samuel
02:30
What's the uh out of nowhere, give me your top five. Like what are the the ones your go-tos? I could just I mean I would I'll just drop the ones I like in first while you give it a bit of thought if you want. I would say that the Mariah Carey one is the is the best one, personally. Like I think that just is It is Christmas. Um, there is a reason there's the meme of the glu the ice breaking. Yeah. Which was a brilliant, uh, brilliant touch. Um, yeah, and then probably after that would be Fairy tale in New York, then probably I do uh this is where I'm curious if you agree. I do quite like the darkness one. Um

Matthew
03:07
I think that's I I think that has crossed over into becoming one of those Yeah yeah, I accept I I do accept it as part of the canon, it's not my favourite.

Samuel
03:16
Yeah, then Last Christmas is obviously a great bit of pop. Yeah. Pop tunery I wouldn't allow Slade in there. That reminds me too much of like Christmas at my grandparents. Um just find it a bit too cursed and British and sort of like Um a bit Operation U Tree adjacent just in terms of it but all being a bit like top of the pops in the 70s and a bit cursed. Not that the b not the band themselves, but just the overall energy of the song. I think it would probably be um So This is Christmas, the John Lennon one. Um That's all right. But I don't mind the I don't mind the Paul McCartney one who's simply having a wonderful Christmas time. That's all right. Yeah. Those are the five, Matthew. Go go ahead.

Matthew
03:53
Okay. Uh yeah, I mean they're they're they're they're all good. Uh I also like my Mariah Carey one. Uh I like driving home for Christmas. Oh yeah, I like that. That's grown on me in recent years actually. It might be more of an old man than You're not gonna like it because you will put it in the same category as the other U-Tree Christmas hits, but I like the Shaking Stevens one. Yeah, I guess. Merry Christmas Every one. Yeah, that one. That other wiz that wizard one is a lot of things. I do like the Shaking Stevens one. Uh of the modern songs, the one which I have I I think should be accepted into like the all time a Christmas canon. is uh Kelly Clarkson's Underneath the Tree. Oh, interesting. Okay. That's a great song. It's so far. She really goes for it. She's so pumped for Christmas. I never ever thought I would hear you bring up Kelly Clarkson on this podcast. That's an absolutely brilliant song. What other ones? I c I like uh Christmas Wrapping by the waitresses. Okay, I better know that one. I also like this so this one i it's debatable whether it's an outright Christmas song, because it's not really, but it was on our album of Christmas music. There's a song Keeping the Dream Alive. I really like that. I can never remember the band's name. It's like a German, it's like a German name. Um But yeah, I I used to I really like that song and Charlotte, uh former editor of Endgamer, she was really into it as well, and that's our like go-to Christmas exchange, like have you listened to Keeping the Dream Alive. as have you like kicked off the Christmas music with that so I not I like most of them. The only one I don't like is uh Spaceman Came Traveling

Samuel
05:34
Oh, I don't even know that one. God, you are so deep into the Christmas canon. For me it's so superficial, but you are so ready for this. It's uh Well done. Um do you follow the work of Kelly Clarkson outside of Christmas?

Matthew
05:46
Uh no, no. I assume she's just written one song about Christmas.

Samuel
05:50
No, she's um she I think I don't think she's like in the charts as much now, but she hosts a talk show in the U in the US. But she does like um like karaoke um sort of like covers on uh and they put some on YouTube And they're really good. And she did um Russian um faux lesbian um anthem um by tattoo, all the things she said this year. And it was like really good. So Um, I do recommend actually ch tracking those down because they're quite fun. I think they're voted for by the audience. But she just does like two and a half minutes of a classic pop song in her in her way.

Matthew
06:24
Maybe underneath the tree is a gateway drug to a whole new world of Kelly Clarkson music. Well anyway, you really um stepped up there, Matthew. So um I also like there's that uh It's got a name like Phil Specter presents a c a Christmas album for you or something. Cursed. No, it is cursed, but like it's it's got the Darling Love stuff on it and uh there's some of those are absolutely amazing as well.

Samuel
06:46
I think um the Chris Rear one's really grown on me actually driving back to Christmas.

Matthew
06:50
Listening to that when you are driving back for Christmas, when you've just done like all your crappy work that you had to get done before the Christmas holidays, you know, when you've had to like program Two weeks of YouTube desperately. Uh and then you just get that drive and hut and you're like, Yeah, you sing it man

Samuel
07:06
Yeah, highly relatable. Um Yeah, it's uh I think it's one of those ones though where when I when I heard that when I was like ten or eleven, I thought this is the most uncool thing I've ever heard.

Matthew
07:16
Yeah, see.

Samuel
07:17
Over the years, yeah, it just it maybe just resonates more.

Matthew
07:19
It's like olives, isn't it?

Samuel
07:21
You don't like it when you're a kid and then suddenly you're like, oh olives are well I say that I still hate them Yeah, or whiskey. Can I just say that I feel really bad for saying that um Slade are like Utre adjacent? I absolutely am not suggesting anything. No, I but th I know what you mean, like they're from that era of Top of the pole. I knew what you were saying. The word adjacent is doing a lot of heavy lifting there. Like it's that's it's really important to point that out. Um but yes, I wish um Holder and company nothing but the best. How was your work Christmas party, Matthew? Actually, should I even have been asking this in the podcast? I thought of banter at the start here, but maybe it's like not the time, I don't know.

Matthew
07:56
Yeah, it was good. Yeah, it was nice. Uh into uh uh place called the Drawing Rooms in Bath, uh which had uh it was like quite cocktaily. You you had like cocktail vouchers, but there was like an hour and a half where it was like all bets are off infinite cocktails And they just had like jugs of these cocktails they were bringing around and you could just like hold up a uh hold up a picture of a thumb if you wanted more cocktail and they just came and poured it for you. It was a picture of Pinky from Promise Mascot Hill. But alas it wasn't. Uh uh I would say it was a deadly combination of infinite cocktails. And about two slices of pizza each. That you must have been absolutely fucked, everyone at the party has. Uh because uh I sat next to the pizzas, I may have had more pizza than other people. And

Samuel
08:46
You you realize what the spawn point was and just parked yourself there basically.

Matthew
08:50
You know it. I'm That is that's my superpower knowing where like pizza's gonna spawn at a party.

Samuel
08:55
Okay, so another Christmas related thing I wanted to ask you was why won't you come to Gav Murphy's Christmas lunch on the 17th in London? You're invited last year as well And you know, I I and I asked you this, you didn't actually answer my message on whether you'd come on. So I so I RSVP'd myself. Matthew be great company there. A lot of people that we like go there. Like Simon Parkin was there last year, Sam White was there last year. Yeah. Like I thought you I thought you would enjoy the crowd, but um I've got t I've got too much work on

Matthew
09:26
It's very, very hard for me to take any time off of like the week running up to Christmas. I had to program two weeks of TikTok content. It

Samuel
09:36
Okay, well fair enough. That is a very particular kind of concern. It's it's like borderline for me. I'm done on the 16th, but there might still there might still be bits to do after the 16th. I'd love to go.

Matthew
09:45
Every year I I miss this thing. Yeah. It's good. It's not because I've got any beef with Gav or anything.

Samuel
09:53
Basically what Gav does, I'm sure people who listens to podcasts are very familiar with Gav Murphy, but from RKG. Basically does something where people who have their own Patreons and make their own stuff, like they don't have a Christmas party, so basically everyone who has a Patreon or is crowdfunded by their listeners or viewers like we are, um very fortunately. Um he invites us along and basically, you know, how have a three course meal and have a bunch of drinks and it's sort of like a Christmas party for creators basically. And it's um Yeah, it's where I met Glenn Moore, the comedian last year actually. Um host the the Button Boys. Um so uh yes, it's Button Boys That's how the thing goes. Matthew fanboying about other people's video games podcasts. Unbelievable. Um yeah, so um uh i yeah, it's cool, but Matthew never comes, but it's it's only 'cause he's busy.

Matthew
10:39
Yeah, I mean I think this just explains And this just explains a lot, like, you know, why you're a lot more popular. This explains why when you tweet about the po when you uh write about the podcast on LinkedIn, you get a hundred thumbs up And when I write about the podcast on LinkedIn, I get three thumbs up.

Samuel
10:57
But that's because you're resharing my post.

Matthew
11:00
I think if you posted

Samuel
11:01
Well I think if you post originally and don't link to me, I think that you would get a similar amount of- Well, I I added my own spin on it.

Matthew
11:09
What you're liking is my spin

Samuel
11:12
You got uh Ash from your office, liked it, and then two of I don't think I liked it.

Matthew
11:18
I know that I I wanna get outside my comfort zone, you know?

Samuel
11:22
Yeah, that's really funny that. Yeah, you're right, you are right. But I'm I'm big on like that d I'm a I work in PR, this is what I do, right? I just I do comms and shit. So that's like my whole thing that I do. So I know how to frame it to get people to engage with it.

Matthew
11:36
That's very clever. I looked I looked down the thumb list and was like w it like starry eyed at all the amazing people who are liking it. I was like wow some of these people sound really powerful

Samuel
11:48
It's like Miyamoto Miyamoto, Aiji Anuba, really like this one. Shutakumi, they were all there, all my favorites. Kazaka I think the guy who I interviewed who's like the creative director of Beyond Good and Evil 2 liked it. I was like, I don't know why you're engaging with this, but it's very nice that you paid attention. I just assumed everyone who liked it has listened to every episode. Definitely not. They're a bit like good for you, basically, about it. Little pat of the heads. Well they might run to it, you know? Oh some of them do. I was at a um there's always a thing called Pi Armageddon, um in the In in Bath and London as and Brighton where basically some PRs turn up, put some money behind the bar, and it's like a say hello to journalists at the end of the year. Um, nice working with you, thank you for everything, etc. Um and if you think that sounds like video games corruption, it's not really, because I don't think the journalists uh terribly enjoy being there. Um I d well I think the PRs enjoy it a lot more than the journalists, because you get to the end of the night and it's always a group of PRs chatting. And all the journalists are gone. So I I think it's just that like I don't know, I think journalists are just like, you know what, I'll sort of go home at a certain point.

Matthew
12:53
That's because all the journalists have to go and make the thirteenth issue of their mag in two days.

Samuel
12:58
Yeah, exactly. Or like schedule stuff for Christmas or wherever. Um but it's um it's it's very fun. But th at that um that drinks thing I had five different PRs, say I really like the podcast and and like um d uh w one of them referenced like individual episodes or conversations we had about you discussing the theatre and stuff and it was like It's really nice actually, you know, it's feel like I'm patting us on the back again here. But it was just, you know, people do actually listen to it and do like it. And maybe not Miyamoto or Shotakumi, but Who knows Matthew? I'll send Ian a USB stick and say FAO Shooter Kumi Comma the Cupboard, you know, where he works basically. I think he'd like it. I think he'd enjoy us talking about his work. Yeah, I think that's probably true. But anyway, this this podcast said Matthew Should we talk about the Game Awards trailers a bit? Because this is like the really like the end of year kind of like the only livestream thing that rehappens at the end of the year. Um so it's a b an excuse for a bunch of things to get announced at once. I think uh it's very fair to say that Jeff Keeley owns this little Christmas window um now. So you get a bunch of trailers at once, some paid for, some editorial slots obviously, um depending on what they are. And um Yes, uh, even though I don't think it's disclosed which one's which, so you left guessing, how exciting. Um but uh I thought we'd do top fives of our favourite trailers, Matthew. Five, four, three, two, one, etcetera. But what did you think of the show overall as someone who stayed up and watched at least a bit of it?

Matthew
14:29
Yeah, I watched I w did watch most of it. Um yeah, I yeah, I I I th I you know, I thought it was fine. I I think it's like all of these awards, uh The actual awards part of it very, very sidelines. Like I feel I feel I don't really understand why he doesn't just call it like the winter showcase. Because I feel like more people are tuning in for the the trailers and the announcements. That's really the the purpose it serves and he himself the way his speed runs. through the awards, you know, in the way y you know, not everyone comes up on stage and gets them. There's a billion think pieces about the game awards that came out in the last few days and you know, you can read all those for for far deeper thoughts. Um I think my biggest problem with it is I don't really agree with the like the voting procedure, like how they come up with the lists. 'cause uh it's like every outlet sends in like their nominations for each list and so it ends up basically being like a kind of a metacritic of every gaming site's game of the year list Which means as you know, it's quite sort of homogenous and the same things sort of run across multiple categories and you know it's it's why you get Claire Obscure winning, you know, nine awards or whatever it is. Whereas I you know, I feel like there it there is probably a better way of representing certain genres, whether it's different awards categories or different ways of nominating, but Uh it's not like I've got a master plan written out or anything.

Samuel
15:58
Yeah, I think um uh the public vote thing means that I think it and the joysticks end up just having the same like who managed to motivate their player base the most. feel to it. Um I don't have a problem with the nominations process. I think that's I I think, you know, Jeff does not charge to have your games.

Matthew
16:15
No, no, that's that's true. It's it's more it's more that like you know, the BAFTAs, for example, when they do the performance panel, it's decided by a panel of actors. You know, they they try and like match something to something and I I feel like that's the beginning of the right direction for for coming up with awards.

Samuel
16:34
I agree. And yet Dave the Diver still won for best design at that BAFTAs. So we can't rely on them for everything, you know. But uh Yeah. And Jedi Survivor won nothing, which was a crime. I think. But anyway, um yeah, I I do agree with you. These things are hard to do. Like I don't really I'm not a big Game Awards guy in terms of the you know, like I don't watch the awards. I read the awards afterwards and then like kinda that's that. But that's sort of me with all awards dues really. I think they all have some process that means that not everyone's gonna be satisfied with the result. Um but there aren't that many of them really. It's not like we're awash with really big awards. And I like the idea of them being made into little events in theory. Like the the joysticks being a a big thing and this being a big thing. It's not like there are like this one a month. It's these two and then the BAFTAs and then everyone else really. So Yeah, it's something to sort of it's something to do at the end of the year, and it that's basically my take. It's something to do. So yeah. It's something to do. Um so what did you think of the the actual trailer side of it, Matthew, were you um impressed by what Jeff had on display?

Matthew
17:41
Yeah, I th I thought it was a pretty solid mix. Um I didn't I didn't think there were any like sort of dream come true announcements or those kind of like, holy shit, I can't believe they're doing X but I th I thought, you know Oh, it's some interesting games we'll get to play in 26 and 27 and beyond and uh you know a nice nice mix of things. It wasn't all just fucking souls likes. Um in fact I thought there was there was less of that this year. Um you know, normally it's that and and, you know, ridiculously you know, those sort of uh everything kind of MMO games that look like You know, they've crammed every genre into one game and you know and then it's called sort of, you know, the Pearl Mountain or something and you're like, what?

Samuel
18:29
Um and then you never ever hear of it again. Yeah, that's uh that is true. Um yeah, I think um what I noticed about the games is that in this like massive mix of stuff you had people who had like chucked a bunch of money at games about four or five years ago, like their stuff finally coming to the fore. So, you know, like um like the the studio like negoti went off and made, for example, with like um you know, with with uh sort of like uh basically money from I think is it Net Ease he had? Yeah, I think it's NetEase. Yeah, and then like Wizards of the Coast as well, who set up their own video games thing so their games are like popping up now and you know, one one was based on uh, you know, Dunge uh Dungeons and Dragons, one was not. And so you're seeing like these people who yeah, they're not necessarily your biggest publishers. So he did have quite a big Capcom presence there. Um, you know, just sort of like Yeah, w we're moving into this space now. We're finally ready to show off what we what we funded. Um hopefully the games won't come out and we won't just close the studios automatically after they they ship. Sorry, but the last few years has made me a bit like That's what's gonna happen about so many things in video games at the moment. But um I was like quite impressed overall. I thought there was some good stuff in there. I thought Day of the Death is pretty good as well, Matthew, some good stuff in there. So um Yeah, just nice having a bunch of reveals at the end of the year, isn't it? So um yeah.

Matthew
19:50
So should we kick on?

Samuel
19:51
It lets us do this episode.

Matthew
19:53
It does. Without without this awards, it would just be the pantomime bit and You don't want that.

Samuel
19:59
And discussing Matthew's favourite Christmas songs, which I did enjoy, but um was arguably superfluous content. So uh yes. Um what's your number five then, Matthew, out of the out of the reveals.

Matthew
20:10
Uh well it's it I hope it's not cheeky to take the Tomb Raider pairing.

Samuel
20:14
Well that's higher on my list, so um yes, maybe we come back to that. We're doing higher on my list, are we? Well we don't have to. Why don't you talk about it first, I don't know.

Matthew
20:22
Let's do it, let's do it. Like the last time we did this and we didn't do higher on my list, it threw me a bit. What what episode was that?

Samuel
20:28
Metroid. Um It was really I fucked that up so badly. It's because I had two beers when we recorded the episode and it made a mess of it. I couldn't I couldn't deal with it. Yeah, I know. It was it wasn't right. Um, okay, so my number five is uh No Lore, um, which is a game that had about a minute of cutscenes that looked kind of like a cyberpunk ripoff. And then I I was completely out on that. And then it cuts the gameplay, which is a first-person shooter where you can basically like kick guys off rooftops and in into vending machines and Seem to have really nice looking levels, but also really great sort of physicality to the melee attacks and stuff. Um is from a developer called Neon Giant. I think they might have some Wolfenstein people who worked on it, or like machine games people. who were in involved, um Matthew, behind the scenes there. Um but in general I I'm really am just picking this for the um for the game um part of this. Um the world didn't really matter to me that much but People don't make that many first person games that have single player elements to them. Um so I just thought it looked kinda cool. And uh yeah, this is another example of um Craften were the were the backers of this one, but a bit of like new money in games, you know? And even if the cyberpunk part looked a little bit too familiar. I it didn't the combat looked a lot better than Cyberpunk's combat to me. What did you think?

Matthew
21:48
It reminded me a little bit of that um oh what was the 360 game with all like the the crazy kill chain. Yeah yeah Had had a little bit of that energy to it, bit of that attitude. Is this the team that made the ascent? That's right, yeah. That was like It had like an isometric, almost like twin-stick shooter with sort of RPG elements, but had like a real visual density to the world that made you almost wonder like If you pulled the camera down into this, like would this actually hold up, you know, as a third person or first person game? Because it was like so rich. So To see them go from that to a sort of similar sort of dystopian sci-fi setting. You know, if if he actually told me this was a first person game set in that that ascent universe You know, I I I wouldn't question it. So uh yeah, it's got interesting. I thought it looked quite good.

Samuel
22:39
Yeah, I thought the stealth looked good as well. Like it it did a bit of s the old decide to go in stealthily or All guns blazing. I was surprised to learn afterwards that it is an open world game. I I assumed it was just superficially looked like Cyberpunk, but they're actually gonna do the whole The whole world. So um we'll see how it turns out. But uh yeah, I I was impressed. So good stuff. Well done, Jeff. Point number one. What's your number four, Matthew? Divinity. Not on my list.

Matthew
23:04
Not on your list. Yeah, I mean We don't know a huge amount about this, you know, other than they had an incredibly gnarly trailer, which I saw lots of people complaining about the day after, which made me laugh. You gotta decide people, are we for games as art or against games as art? Can you do whatever you like in games or do we do nothing in games?

Samuel
23:23
I love that I love that you're saying that after this trailer was introduced by some lads clearly on wires being pulled into the sky. Like this is art art has arrived in games as this lad flies across the theatre.

Matthew
23:35
No, but it was more like to see people chastising Steve.

Samuel
23:42
It's like well. A very conservative lot. Like could be a little bit of a Liberals who are actually a little bit like uh yeah, have the ick about certain things. That's a uh definitely a thing in games, isn't it? It's weird.

Matthew
23:53
Yeah, I I I think this continues the tradition of of Just Larin being sort of pranksters really. Uh th the the opening teaser trailer that they made for Uh Bordersgate 3 was like equally horrible 'cause it was the guy transforming into the Squid Man and it was like proper body horror. So I I just think they're doing, you know, whatever kind of gleefully entertains them and uh I'm uh yeah, all for that. Um, you know, I I'm not hugely familiar with like the divinity universe outside of Original Sin, which is obviously a quite a it has darkness in it, but it's quite a comic, quite colourful game. Like it feels much lighter than what they're showing in this trailer. So I don't know if those earlier divinity games, you know, which I think are more like Diablo alike, I think, than more like action RPGs. Right. Uh You know, I don't really know what their vibe was. So yeah, I'm interested discovering the divinity thing. I think it's interesting that they're working in their own kind of pre-existing world. Um, you know, obviously more sensible than having to give you know, Wizards of the Coaster cut for some D D Yeah, that makes sense.

Samuel
25:03
I mean I think they have got the cache to bet on themselves um in a big way. Yeah. So The idea as well of like just calling it divinity and it's sort of a clean slate if you don't know what the series is, it'll be like your way in. I think that's all pretty clever stuff to be honest. So Yep, I even though this felt like a million miles away to me. And I I think those are the the sort of that's the bracket of Game Awards reveal I wasn't that interested in is games that don't feel like they're anywhere near, you know, but

Matthew
25:29
Yes, but at the same time I remember w you know when they put out the teaser for Bordersgate three, I think early access was only like a ye like a year max after that. Year and a half. Yeah, so it could happen here as well, right? Yeah, if they go down that route again, which you know they have done again and again and again it's and it hasn't hurt them yet. So Yeah.

Samuel
25:48
Okay. Well I'm definitely interested to see more of this game, Matthew.

Matthew
25:51
So um

Samuel
25:52
That makes sense to pick to me. Um my number four is Exodus, aka we have Mass Effect at home. Um so I thought this looked pretty cool actually. Like in the you know Uh let's face it, it's not a certain a certain thing that we're gonna get another Mass Effect game or indeed another Bioware game. That feels very much up in the air. Um compared to where we were fifteen years ago, for example, with that studio. It's been a dicey few years. And this is some ex-bioware people with whiz the is with the coast lining their pockets. Um including I think Uh Drew Karpershin, I'm probably saying his name wrong then, who um was one of the original Mass Effect writers and like uh created the fiction of the game. um and a KOTOR guy as well, um, is like working on this. So it's a bunch of people who have made bioware games before with big uh big bucks making what looks like another bioware game. It is very mass effecty. It also looks a bit stranger. There's some a time dilation element to it. There's like a grappling hook element to it. He fights a big bear at one point, but it is a third person um shooter with like RPG trappings. I believe there is like a narrative choice element to this. It feels like they've done a bit of the old Johnny Silverhand thing with the way they use Matthew McConaughey in the game as well. He is a character in the game. So they spent big money on it. And I actually do think if they Make this work, it will it will really hit. It is still I think a 2027 game, but there was a bunch of actual what looked like actual gameplay. in the um in the reveal. Uh well the it's not the reveal but it they showed more of the game than they ever have before. In general I was pretty impressed by it Matthew. I'm at least open-minded about it. What do you think?

Matthew
27:25
Wasn't one I paid like a huge amount of attention to. Um I don't know, the Matthew McGonney of it kind of put me off a bit. Yeah, I gotta do it. You know, 'cause it's like, oh, they're they're trying to kind of distract me with a celeb cameo here, but I wasn't aware that it had um that kind of mass faced pedigree behind it. So yeah, I'll I you know I I would love for there to be another good game in that genre, so absolutely.

Samuel
27:52
So yeah, I look forward to seeing more of that at some point next year. What's your number? Three Matthew. Three. Gang of Dragon.

Matthew
27:59
Not on my list. It is hilarious that Nagoshi left Sega to have the freedom to pursue other things, such as making Yakuza again, just like slightly better graphics. I mean like I think we all kinda knew this is probably what was gonna happen. Yeah, probably. Like it it had it had that feel to it, but Uh it did look I thought it looked noticeably different in its aspirations. It looked like it was going for a bit more sort of cinematic action, you know, it was like gunplay and car chases and that kind of stuff in it and uh um you know, I'm not against him experimenting with that, but it just made me laugh to see you know, those kinds of characters in those kinds of small Japanese bars. Um but uh at the same time, you know if like two people want um to make competing yakuza aliks uh or one of them's a yakuza and the other's a yakuza like, I l I like that as a thing, so again, like more of that please. Um You know, the idea of a year where there's like four of these games to review instead of just three. Uh yeah, I mean That's great.

Samuel
29:14
Yeah. I feel for the edge contributors having to get through those, but um for everyone else for sure. Who's the guy who's in it, Matthew? I can't remember his name. Is he one of your guys? He's the big lad from the Eternals. Yeah, and uh what else is he from? Trained to Boosan. Yeah, Train to Boosan. Yeah, I mean I I feel very well represented by that. They've never had a beefy, like big lad protagonist before in these games, so You know, it's nice to see that representation in there. Um I was a bit distracted by the English language of the trailer. Um but yeah, but I'm definitely up for seeing you know, another version of this. Did you want him to make like a binary domain spiritual successor? Were you kinda hoping for that low-key Matthew from uh Negoshi?

Matthew
29:53
No, not not really. I mean You you just you just imagine like the the the kind of things he was saying about you know wanting to branch out made you think, oh is he sitting on something like completely different? Yeah. You know, I didn't expect him to repeat anything really, but Then you see it and you're like, well, yeah, okay. Yeah, that tracks. You know, he is good at that thing. Like the games was very, very strong under him. So uh And also uh a version of this which doesn't have any baggage of like there are fifteen other entries and even though I don't think you do need to know the whole Yakuza series to jump into it, you need to know you know, maybe more of it than is helpful for some people. So Yeah. Yeah.

Samuel
30:33
That is true. It's and you know, it's a chance to, you know, set it apart in terms of like it looks like a proper shiny next gen kind of thing. Um whereas the look of the modern Yakusa games quite quite familiar. Um Madong Siok is the actor Matthew I'm probably pronouncing that. Terribly. But um there it is.

Matthew
30:51
I'm looking forward to Gang of Pirate Dragons that comes a year after.

Samuel
30:55
Gang of Dragon is I mean, I could have been uh could have workshopped that a little bit more, I think, but Alas. Um I'm curious about that for sure. Um so we'll see where that lands. My number three is Control Resident Matthew. Is this on your list? Uh it isn't. I thought this looked way more visually interesting than Control, the twenty nineteen remedy game that it's a sequel to. Described as an action adventure RPG, um, but has big inception vibes. It's set in a Manhattan where uh bits of it are folded over, um so it's like uh Yeah, like that bit in Paris in Inception basically where it's just, oh, the skyscrapers popping out the sides because the the world's gone. kind of bananas. Um but then the actual gameplay looked pretty different from control. It looked a bit hack and slashy, which is quite different for um for Remedy. I associate control as a you know, with chucking stuff across the room basically at different enemies. Um and it definitely looked like it had a bit more going on in terms of worlds and environment and story than control, which I always thought felt like you could see where the money ran out. Um it really felt quite, you know, you you had that. the odd, cool sort of corridor with a a few weird bits of geometry in it that where you go, ooh, that's strange. Hell what bizarre liminal spaces these are, um, as intended by the art directors of the game. But I think when it came down to it, there were still a few too many like corners cut or repeated locations or or f or parts where it felt like the game just didn't reach its full potential. Um but it looks a bit like the kind of Alan Wake 2 if occasion of control where there's a bunch of new money that's gone into it and they're just spending it on giving you some pretty wild and wacky and like big blockbustery stuff. Um it is uh the story is about the uh about Dylan, the brother of um Whatsa Chops from the original control Matthew. Lots of facts here um in my Sunday evening um discussion of this game. Um but it's uh yeah, I I was just I just thought it looked different and like kind of what I wanted from a sequel, Jesse Faden as the character. Um yeah, so it's um Dylan, uh brother, um who is talked about a lot in the uh in the first game. But I don't know, it seems like they're trying to expand the fiction of it quite a lot with what they've done here. What did you make of it?

Matthew
33:11
Yeah, I I I really like the look of it. Uh I think it's interesting that they're doing melee combat. Um you know, I'm curious if they still do all the kind of you know, wacky wacky powers. I guess that was s not not a necessarily a flaw of the first control, but the fact that it you know, you had a gun but then you also had all these other kind of projectile powers you know, I f I feel like the g you know the gunplay or some of it could get maybe lost in the mix a bit and you could just over rely on all those superpowers. So yeah, I'm interested to see how they do. something that's a bit more kind of up in your grill. Um definitely agree with them being like out and about in New York would be a bit more exciting. Uh yeah, no, it's good. I d I just hope I don't have to have like an encyclopedic knowledge of of the control universe to understand it. Um that's my only sort of wrinkle if I even have have one really with remedy games is like the They're so all in on their their kind of connected universe. Um, that that gives me the fear a tiny bit.

Samuel
34:11
We had an interesting chat about this on WhatsApp. Where I was like, I think Max Pain 2 is the like the best written of these games, and you were like, Oh, I don't think the writing's ever been that good in these games, really. And Yeah, I mean I I I think vibe is a big part of what these games do. And I think that with Alan Wake too it disappeared into this slightly impenetrable Like almost it was like a layer of like it was it was speaking to a layer of Alan Wake fan that I w wasn't even sure exists, because I'm I'm one of the guys who played Alan Wake, I played the DLC, I played American Nightmare I thought I really knew it and understood it. But then it felt like it was tapping into or talking about all this stuff that I just didn't understand and I th I didn't quite get who it was for. But then people seemed to love the game anyway and I I felt a little bit at odds with it in the end. You know what I mean?

Matthew
34:57
Yeah, well I mean that's yeah, well I guess we'll have to see whether this sort of like goes further down that or is is happy to be just a sequel to control. rather than everything they've ever made.

Samuel
35:09
Indeed, hopefully it is self-contained. What's your number two, Matthew? Uh it's that orbitals. Well that's my number one, so let's talk about it here.

Matthew
35:15
Yeah, um this is the uh sort of 3D uh co-op game, uh could we describe it as like, is it the first it takes two alike? Yeah. Like a game that you've it looks like you have to play in co-op? Was my read on the trailer? I don't know if that's right or wrong of the actually said.

Samuel
35:34
Surely must be.

Matthew
35:35
Yeah, and it looks it looks like they've yeah, they've Put it on switch two because it has the two controllers built in and you'll be playing it two player. A lot of the interactions look like the Yeah, it takes tool split fiction where, you know, one person is has one mechanic that's helping the other person on their screen. Um set in a uh sort of An anime sci-fi universe uh flying around space in a little spaceship. I think you're trying to sort of s collect parts to save your space station home from kind of going kaboom, so, you know, it looks like there's gonna be some sort of ship exploration and then puzzle serving and combat once you get onto the ships, all wrapped up in this uh amazing art style which really captures this sort of like Yeah, like 80s anime, almost like the sort of fu like the sort of fuzzy haze of how those things looked. Um I thought the transition from like You know, what look like cutscene to gameplay was was really smoothly done, like they've they've really like nailed that style. Um Yeah, just really exciting. Nice to see someone going like all in on Switch 2 as well.

Samuel
36:45
Yeah, I think it's a good idea to make it to kind of associate it with Switch 2 as a thing. Um that's a good little bit of marketing, 'cause no doubt. you could just put this on Xbox or PS5 and PC. And they su I'm sure they will eventually. Um but yeah like the you just it's undeniable that a visual style. It's the fact that It seems so like all encompassing. You know, every time the camber turns, there's a you know, the the character models still look right with that visual style. And yeah, the gameplay, you know, I like a reveal with gameplay and this had plenty of it. It did look like a bit of these two characters, these two explorers, like Matthew says. Their space station home is crumbling. Um they're and uh that it's in like a supernatural cosmic storm. And they're basically like, yeah, there's one character moving another thing so a character can get through. It takes two alike as spot on and we talked about when we talked about split fiction this year, we were like, when is there gonna be a wave of games that are doing a similar thing? 'Cause clearly there is a huge appetite for couch co-op stuff. And yeah, that merged with this wonderful art style. Undeniable. I can't wait, Matthew. This is my number one for a reason. This is far out my number one for sure. So um okay, my number two is The two Tomb Raider games, Matthew. Um, so uh we had a remake of the original Tomb Raider, which is coming next year, and uh a game um that I've not written down the name of. um which is foolish. Catalyst. Catalyst, which is appears to be a sequel to Two Made Underworld, Matthew, continuing the timeline of uh series, you know, the series as it was originally running. um before it was rebooted and and the like. Oh I I actually hadn't seen that information. I think that's true. I'll double check that while we're talking but I mean if that's true, that's rad as hell.

Matthew
38:30
Like I'm into that.

Samuel
38:31
Yeah and so um I just thought that was uh uh it is considered a direct sequel to Tomb Raider Underworld. Yeah. Um Wow. Yeah. It's uh that should be in higher on my list then, 'cause I r I love Underworld Yeah, that's what the game the game director said from a time perspective. Catalysts said years after the events of Underworld. That's what the uh Crystal Dynamics said. Um so you have you have that combined with a remake of the first game, which has already been remade with Tomb Raider Anniversary, but you know, albeit twenty years ago now, um, which is uh you know uh shocking really. um which is being co-developed by um Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog. Um the Amazon, big Amazon money is behind um these projects, but I thought that the remake looked really good. Um I thought Cat Catalyst, which is coming out in 27, looked um, you know, you didn't get that much of it, but it looked like a a big original, uh sort of like traditional bit of two Raider. And I think there's a lot of appetite for that now. I don't think anyone wants another even though I know people Sort of did like the direction. Some people did like the direction that the Tomb Raider games took with Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Um the kind of like uncharted or like naughty doggy. Doggy. Naughty Dog-esque riff that they took with that 2013 game. I think people are ready for something a bit more in that original mold. Um and yeah, so as a combo I thought it was a great announcement, Matthew, what did you think?

Matthew
39:54
Basically all that, and just the idea that we're gonna have, yeah, one next year and then one the year after and uh you know been waiting for Tomb Raider for quite a while, so yeah, two of these. Uh you know, I I loved Anniversary twenty years ago, but I am absolutely up for I think this looks, you know, substantially different. It looks like they're they're doing something quite a bit. you know, m more writhing on the idea of the levels, you know, Anniversary itself was already, you know, quite a departure from the original, but Uh, you know, it's a it's a classic game. By remaking it it means you know you're gonna get to see some amazing set pieces, you know, again. You're gonna get a load of tombs, you're gonna get loads of platforming puzzles. Um that's what that's what I really like in these games. So yeah, I'm I'm incredibly excited. Um I just hope uh it feels like Crystal Dynamics has just had like a really shitty run of it. Um so just exciting to see them putting something out again and and doing what in my eyes they they should have should have been doing all along really.

Samuel
40:57
Yeah, by the time it gets here it would have been seven years since Avengers came out. So it's uh Yeah yeah, I feel like we're uh they're due a win. I really want them to get a win. So um Yeah. Um fingers crossed in that one, Matthew. We come to your number one. Uh which is Ontos by Frictional. Ah.

Matthew
41:13
I yeah, I I I just really like the look of this first person we can guess psychological horror. Um the trailer's very sort of cinematic a lot of like characters and exposition and stories but you could see that it looks really bioshocky There's the a brilliant bit of VO from Stellan Skarsgard just like bringing that kind of like menace to this world. I like frictional stuff. I'm by no means like a a huge frictional head or anything, but um the I just I just really like the ear imagery of it and not, you know, just you know, i in in the the course of a ninety second trailer, you just saw so many glimpses of interesting things that I just want to know, oh what's that? Oh what's that? What's that thing over there? Why there j look what looks like giant heads on the moon? What's going on? Yeah, I just I thought this this looked uh Super super exciting.

Samuel
42:05
Yeah, I didn't like Soma. I wasn't big on that game. I liked the environment art, but I didn't like the writing or the voice acting at all. It wasn't my sort of thing. However I do think the studio are cool. I did really like Amnesia the Bunker. That was a very cool game. Um really interesting. So Yeah, I like the it felt like they had a a bunch of Kepler money behind all this. You know, it felt like the money was doing the heavy lifting in terms of environment art and and that sort of thing. So Yeah, this the Skarsgard thing was just like a great touch on top, you know. He just he's just always good, that guy, you know. So yeah. Yeah. Um really good stuff, Matthew. Okay. Well those are two two pretty solid top five list there. I enjoyed discussing that with you. Um but now we must talk about the Badger game, Matthew. Um which I didn't even write down the name of, but I watched the trailer. Bradley the Badger. Bradley the Badger I believe it has um some is it that David Sol Solani guy who did um Mario Plus Rabbids. So it's uh Platforming game that is also about game development. It's like a bit of satire combined with a 3D platformer. You can transform into different objects. There are parts of the world that are unfinished. And it has a sense of humour, which is always a dangerous territory for 3D platformers to go into. We know how Matthew feels about 3D platformers that don't feature Mario on the whole. So I really want to get Matthew's thoughts on this game, which I think a lot of people were saying was their favourite reveal of the show Matthew, but obviously didn't make our top fives.

Matthew
43:32
Yeah, I I didn't think it looked, you know, terrible or anything. So I guess that what I couldn't really get my arms around this trailer is what is the main thing here? Is it like spoose of other games? 'Cause that seemed to be a thing, you know, the different worlds seemed to be riffing on different games. But then there also seemed to be this sort of uh almost like development tool adjacent power set where you could like manipulate the world or morph your character into other objects and I'm interested in Are those little like one-off gimmicks for like certain levels? You know, are they the equivalent of a power-up in Astrobot or Mario, for example? Or have you got a set of wild tools with which to experiment and mess around in this world, which is a bit more of an interesting pitch, but Maybe felt the trailer was like a little cluttered with stuff and I couldn't get like an amazing read on it. I can't say like what platforming was in there jumped out as like jumped out Sometimes you see like a character do something, you're like, Oh, I can't wait to do that. He looked quite big and heavy to me. But then I don't know if that is the thrust of it or if it is the fact that he can turn into a bit of wool texture or whatever it is and then slide up a wall, like if that's more the the pitch of it. So Yeah, it's a bit it's a bit of a shrug from me to be honest, but yeah. Yeah, I know m I I thought the writing was a bit naff, but uh That's the thing and there was loads of it. Like if that character's talking like non-stop, that might be hard work.

Samuel
44:56
I'm also like I've I feel like I've seen multiple like video game characters do the oh I used to be a big deal and now I'm over the hill kind of thing. This is literally what Bubsy4D does as well. It's like we know you're embarrassing now Bubsy. But I think that sort of thing is just like Uh actually more tired than just doing a sincere 3D platformer, you know?

Matthew
45:17
Um it's kinda yeah, I I think the last time anyone got away with that was uh Conker's Bad Fur Day. Yeah. And There by only making him so like disgusting that he felt like a proper like washed up guy, which was which was quite good.

Samuel
45:31
I agree with you on the game parodies thing because I I was there thinking Well you know, why do a parody of The Last of Us? Like Kirby kind of already does this in a 3D platform and it's really good, you know, like it's and it's not even a parody of The Last of Us, it's just it happens to be uh you know, post-apocalypse basically. So Yeah, I was a bit like I just thought the jokes should be better. If you can have jokes in your trailer, just make them actually funny.

Matthew
45:55
Like you know when you say parody platformer, like I think of Gex, which I think is death So um Yeah, it's tough.

Samuel
46:02
Um I'm I'm curious for sure. Like I I I did think the animation was really nice and all that kind of stuff. I also But all the transformation stuff was a bit of a uh from me. I think maybe it's just because I played through Mario Galaxy where like, you know, there's a couple of really good ones, but then there's some some where I was a bit like, no, and more of this Um I'm not saying they all had Spring Mario energy, the different transformations, but I would rather have like one character with a really good moveset, I think, than have to turn into a ball to roll up the side of a wall or whatever. It was there's a bit a bit too much of that in this trailer, you know? So yeah. We'll see how that goes, Matthew, but I did want to ask you about it nonetheless. Um what's some stuff you were less fussed about, Matthew?

Matthew
46:43
I can't I can't remember its name, but there was that one where there was like a little old lady floating around.

Samuel
46:48
That's number one on mine as well. Is it like the something of the chicken coven or something like that? Chicken flip coven. I'll I'll have a look it up. I'll look it up while we're doing that. Uh covered of the chicken.

Matthew
46:58
I just saw the floating animation, thought whatever that is, I I don't want to be part of it.

Samuel
47:04
That is yeah, this is the new game from um Bruce Straley who works at Naughty Dog. Oh man, that's crazy. The thing is It is like Iko with an old lady, right? And no offense, but I've already played Iko. Like, I'm- I'm done. Like, I know that either the creature dies or the old lady dies, or both, alright? That's gonna that's gonna happen. That's in the post, right? But yeah, it was like the old lady floating had you know that bit in The Last Jedi where Princess Leia gets launched, gets lamped out into space. Then she wakes up and starts floating around. It's the one bit of the the film where my eyebrow just raises of like I think this might be dumb.

Matthew
47:40
Um and it was one of the things That's a bit where I was like, I'm enjoying this, but I know that other people aren't gonna like this and it's gonna be really hard to defend it.

Samuel
47:48
So yeah, it's like definitely nothing against having like like a a NAN coded character being a main character. You know, I definitely would not say that. There are plenty of like old dude characters in games.

Matthew
48:01
Yeah.

Samuel
48:01
But there was just it just didn't Some people were acting like it was the best reveal of the show and I was like It kind of looks like a PS3 sort of platformer or something. I don't know, it just didn't quite She looks like the old lady from um Tweety Pie. Oh yeah, it does a little bit, yeah. Uh so yeah that was a bit of a no from me dog unfortunately. But I wish you I wish it well and if you enjoyed the look of it then that's that's good. I wish you well also. Anything else, Matthew, that you bounced on?

Matthew
48:27
I mean it was more of a pre-show thing, but there was that thing from the audio surf guy that I thought looked a bit ropey.

Samuel
48:33
Yeah, it's like plugging any music and it turns into a sort of like twin stick shooter looking thing, was that it? Sort of that vibe?

Matthew
48:39
Quite like rough looking. Or or certainly the trailer didn't sell me on the connection between the music and what was happening on screen. Yeah. But it wasn't enough to look at it and go, oh yeah, I can really see that working. Um You know, obviously I'll plug Randy Neme into it and see what happens.

Samuel
48:53
Get a bit of driving hope for Christmas up and there, you know?

Matthew
48:56
Yeah, yeah. I tell you what Bullet hell shooter would be underneath the tree. That song is so fast.

Samuel
49:03
Yeah, I uh it that was very much like it looked like uh an indie game from the audio surf era of Steam, you know, like the late noughties kind of thing

Matthew
49:11
Yeah.

Samuel
49:12
Yeah. It was very um what's it called? Uh sort of like oh what's the term? Like win amp coded, you know what I mean? It had a bit of that vibe about it. Um, I would say the t I would say the two Star Wars games Matthew didn't um they just felt too far off to me. Like uh I can't get invested in a Knights the Old Republic sequel that's been in development for like a year or whatever and like they're still hiring for the studio. I just We were already waiting for that um The Quantic Dream Star Wars game that was announced years ago and hasn't reappeared. We're waiting for that turn-based Star Wars game. I just don't I just think they should have waited like three years to announce that game, personally, but Yeah, the racing one I'm more curious about, but it was a CG trailer, so yeah. Um anything else?

Matthew
49:58
There was that thing called Stupid Never Dies. Ugh It just looked really hectic and I thought I'm too old for whatever that is. It's implied it's a load of ex Capcom people, right? Yeah, it is like uh yeah, that's that's correct, yeah. With a bit of money. Is it is it like Is it actually like it's Suno or is it other people from the Devil May Cry team?

Samuel
50:17
Yeah, Hiroyuki uh Kobayashi who was um Sengoku Basura series, which is uh that's like a mid capcom, isn't it really? That's not like um Full fat Capcom. But it looked like um a budget Suda fifty one game to me.

Matthew
50:32
That's yeah. And I thought well there's you know, there's already people out there doing this this, you know, and

Samuel
50:38
in a quite an established way in the Yeah, actual actual Suda fifty one's already making these kind of games, you know.

Matthew
50:44
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that wa that was a bit of a no. Um those were the things which I wrote down, but

Samuel
50:50
Maybe I've forgotten some other howlers. Some people were very down on that High Guard game at the end. I thought that looked a little bit like uh does the world need another PvP game with a load of wacky caps in it. Well it's it might it might be absolutely brilliant. Well my thing was that there was a brief moment where I thought, is this a single player game with all this cool traversal and like abilities where you break a wall? And I saw all the other human characters turn up and I was I just groaned, like, oh Like it's you know, I I did think Titanfall was a really cool game. It's made by people who worked on that and Apex Legends, but it's like um I just I just yearn for something that's more Titanfall 2 single player than Titanfall multiplayer, you know? So that's just uh that's just me there, Matthew. But um Yeah, and that's very much the Game Awards chat done, Matthew. So uh should we take a quick break and come back with the panto? Welcome back to the podcast. Time for the Panto bit. Oh, being funny on purpose on a Sunday night. Oh fucking love doing that. I'm at my best on a Sunday night, my best material, my highest energy levels, optimistic about the week to come. Jesus Christ. Um a few bits of uh Christmas uh preamble, Matthew. Um shall we talk about bath at Christmas this year? And can I ask the question, are we sure the Christmas market is good? Because good lord, the population crowding. They had a fucking bloke at Bar Spa Station yelling in a megaphone. Absolute jobsworth stuff. Um just uh pi people had to get into different queues and wait an hour to get on a train. Wait an hour wait an hour before they even let you in the station on the Saturday. Just a fucking nightmare, really. But where are you at on Bath at Christmas

Matthew
52:32
Yeah, it seemed like especially hellish this year for I wouldn't say like an all-timer selection of of wares. Definitely not. Yeah, it's rubbish. When I come out of work every day The market's still open for a couple of hours and is cooled off enough that you can just go and explore it. Like that that seems to be the key, is like Don't go on a Saturday. It it did annoy me. I started getting served. Sort of anti-Bath Christmas market TikToks. Right. Of people being like, look how d look how crowded it is. This is disgusting. We're being treated like animals. And it's like I mean it's a very popular market on a Saturday. Like, what did you think was gonna happen? You know, there are times when you can avoid that. I don't really know what people want from it. Like, because i I'm always sort of fascinated by which stores are and aren't You know, the busy ones and who who's queuing up for things and it honestly looks like most people just go for like quite overpriced food stalls or dr like Stuff to eat or drink at the market to sustain you as you explore the market. Mm. And again, it was like that this year. Just yeah, mega cues for like macaroni cheese for like nine quid aware. Yeah, that kind of thing. And I'm like I don't I wouldn't travel anywhere for that experience.

Samuel
53:47
No, I don't really get it. It just seems like it's like a type of person who's like my kids are annoying me and I need them out of the house doing something so I'm gonna just make them walk very slowly around this boring market for a day. I just truly do not do not understand the people who do that. Um Yeah, it's a bit weird. Like I I think that my favorite version of it is do you remember that pre-COVID they had like um in Kingsmead Square, uh like a food market specifically? And it was like Seven or eight stands and loads of tables in the middle. And it was like a a thing you entered, you browsed the food, it was all in one place. It ran for a shorter time. I think it might even have been like separate to the main market. But it had like you know, like a Mexican stand and like uh you know like two different burger stands and Right. But like loads of different food to try and it was like It was like a pretty good variety of stuff and there were so many tables that you could like get a seat and just have a bit more of a relaxed experience. That was my ideal version of it, but I just hate those wooden huts, man. I just think they're rubbish. But uh and they make it really hard to get around the town centre. They tried to create like a a sort of like one way system in a certain place and g keep left and all that stuff and I'm like mate this is a fucking city centre. What are you playing at? People obviously weren't obeying it.

Matthew
55:03
A a mess really but um it it was s it was because it was so busy in the centre of town, it pushed me away from my usual lunch. I wouldn't s they they weren't like over familiar, but I could see it in their eyes. They're a little bit like, oh here he is again. Here he is again, having his baguette and his brownie and his apple juice. And To go back in there and you could see that they remembered. You could see that there was an air of like, Oh, look who's back, look who came crawling back. Uh and so I mean it is a good launch, but Mm maybe I'm projecting too much onto that. That's funny. The cake cafe. Yeah, I've still never been in there. Then the replacement of Intermezzo seems to have shut down.

Samuel
55:55
Oh well that was gonna happen, wasn't it? Like the fucking day I went in there and he w told some customer, Yeah, sorry, we're out of chicken today. And it's like well, frankly sir, you shouldn't be running a sandwich shop. That's how I felt about that guy. Um Yeah, not too surprised by that to be honest. It was seemed like he just didn't have the stuff that Tony had, you know.

Matthew
56:20
Really?

Samuel
56:20
That's weird.

Matthew
56:21
Yeah, like sitting at the table and it's a different person. Wha what? I d I don't know what's going on in there. Like I don't know if like legally someone has to be There for it to qualify something. I don't know what the deal is. That's maybe it's a ghost.

Samuel
56:35
That's got big side quests in an RPG energy, hasn't it? It's like Go investigate why is there a different guy at the shop every day? And like take photograph each guy and then we'll we'll try and figure this out. That's a uh

Matthew
56:47
Yaku's a spin off judgment mini side story for sure. Take photos. I've heard there's four different people lurking in this shop on different days.

Samuel
56:58
My friend um my friend uh David Lynch, not the d film director obviously, who is deceased this year, um, but a man from Wales who once worked on an Xbox magazine. um came to see me with his family yesterday and um walked past JC's kitchen and was like, It's the JC's kitchen from the podcast. And then um realized that he didn't know anything about um the food. And so um it's obviously like a Filipino uh place. And um his wife is from the Philippines and was like, How did you why did you never mention this part of it? And I was like, Well we're too fixated on the fact that It's called Jesus Christ Kitchen. And the bloke never turned up for like years. And that was like the whole the whole thing with it, basically. Um But he was a bit like, oh yeah, it's odd to realise these are real places or not. you know, like uh fictional taverns in like a fable game or something.

Matthew
57:48
And I'm like yeah This isn't the archers, this is real life.

Samuel
57:51
People actually live just a radio play we make it up as we go along. There's actually real people here, real businesses. Um anyway, yes. Um did you ever enjoy festive bullshit in your hometown, Matthew? Back in Winchester. Uh do you ever do anything like that? And do you crave something from Bath Christmas that it cannot give you?

Matthew
58:09
quite a nice tradition of my little sister playing in a brass band on like Christmas Eve, the sort of Hampshire youth brass orchestra or whatever they're called. We'd get together and play like pop songs but like brassy versions. Oh I wouldn't mind hearing a bit of that music in Bath. Um that would be a good. Yeah, that's it. Um We used to have uh in the the town I grew up, Alsford, we used to have a Christmas tree lighting, you know, when they turned on the Christmas lights and they lit up the Christmas tree, that's when Father Christmas would come to you know come and you know, kids could line up and get some get some gift or whatever. But they were always quite elaborate, like they did quite big. you know, they seem to invest quite a lot of money. I mean maybe it's because I was younger and these things seemed crazy to us, but like I swear one year they had like a replica of like Thunderbird one fly down Broad Street lifted by a crane to turn on the Christmas lights. That's cool. Because like Father Christmas was like, I need the Thunderbirds to turn on the Christmas lights and so Lo and behold, the Thunderbirds came. I guess nothing else was happening that night. Like somewhere, an earthquake has killed ten million people. Yeah, the hood's to let off a chemical bomb in Paris, but uh you know, at least uh classic the hood. So that was always fun, except one year one of my parents uh very close friends was like involved in the running of all this and he enlisted me to be part of the reveal. I mean this is just an indicator of the times, but like, you know, it must have been at the h the height of uh Who Wants to be a Millionaire? And the gimmick was, I, as an elf, had to win f like th Father Christmas coming to Bath, coming to our town to turn on the lights. Right. So I had to play this like who wants to sm do this little like Who Wants to be a millionaire skit dressed as an elf. Absolutely mortified knowing that all my school friends would see it and just like b bully me mercilessly for doing something so incredibly cringe. My character's name was Silly Billy. And we talk about like in front of a crowd of I don't know if a thousand, but like hundreds, dressed as an elf. doing like a Who Wants to Be Millionaire bit. Stressful. Oh why did I say no? It felt like I couldn't. I felt like I was pressured into it. That's really funny. And that's uh yeah so that That was the end of that. Yeah. Never show myself at the Christmas lights again.

Samuel
01:00:38
You never returned to Winchester after that. It was the end, basically. You've never been back. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah, I don't really I I mean I would I had to Google it like if Gothsport where I grew up in Hampshire even had Christmas lights. It did allegedly, but I have no memory of it, so it can't have been that remarkable. Portsmouth I remember being a bit of a bigger deal with Christmas because they had like a proper high street and not just like eight betting shops on a weather spoons, which is basically what Gossport High Street was and and is to be honest. Um, but um yeah, I the thing I remember is like in my school we did um a Christmas like fate thing. And so it was like we had a Santa Claus there and little stalls and all this stuff. And I remember going into like Santa's Grotto. And what was unmistakably the ginger beard of like my my mate Donald's dad As Santa Claus. It was like a ginger beard fighting out underneath a f a very unconvincing fake white one. And looking at his two elves and what was unmistakably Donald's little pair of glasses. um a very tiny tiny boy with a little hat on. And like and his brother, who was called Douglas, um who didn't wear glasses. I knew what was going on immediately and then realized as well that I was about three years older than the intended kind of like median age of people who are going to. um Santa Squatto at this fate. And that stays in my memory. And later on Donald just sort of came out and went, Oh, that was weird, wasn't it? That you came in and I was dressed as an elf. Who's the other one? Me, silly Billy. Oh yeah, true. Sorry, I forgot that. Um it was a very memorable anecdote. I just uh yeah. Well no, I just hadn't banked it as like a a memory of mine. Anyway.

Matthew
01:02:30
Well, bank it. Bank it now.

Samuel
01:02:32
I will. Matthew Castle, aka Silly Billy, the man who can never return to the Winchester Christmas lights. Yeah, I don't know, but I sort of um I don't really get into the headspace of this that much. I was in Tottenham Court Road recently to meet some friends and we had like a mold wine and that was literally £9. 50 that mold wine. It was crazy. But was it nice to sit at Tottenham Court Road Station where they renovated it? um and just uh have a nice smalled wine and catch up with friends it was actually so I kind of I get I think I'm getting into this slightly more as I get older. Like I'm maybe gently getting into it more. But People talk to me about putting up their tree and I don't have a Christmas tree and I don't do anything in my flat at Christmas. Like it's completely a non-event to me. Maybe it's because I rent still, you know, hoping to buy a place next year. Maybe if I do that I'll find a place to store a Christmas tree and then put it up and then, you know, all the rest of it.

Matthew
01:03:24
But I don't know. It's a huge commitment, the Christmas tree, because it's a big old box. If you have a fake Christmas tree, that is. And that's gotta live somewhere in your house all the time. Yeah. This is the first year we've got one. We bought our first fake Christmas tree this year to have to have a Christmas tree, you know, in our lounge, which is nice. It's nice to it's nice to have it, but already I'm like Wigging out about that box.

Samuel
01:03:50
Think of the Wii U games you could have stored in the space that's gonna take up, Matthew. It's uh the you draw tablets and such that could have gone there instead. Um that box that box is destined for the attic along with the U draw tablets. Uh yeah, so I I do look forward to a few like little food bits and pieces and stuff, but um I don't really partake in the Christmas sandwich. They're all pretty mediocre, over-refrigerated. Like even the pret one isn't very good, which is disappointing Uh if Makoko do one in Bath Matthew, that's I'm gonna go check that out tomorrow and see what the deal is. Scope that out, scout out the sandwiches. If they do if they do one I think they'll pull it off, but um in general I don't believe in the in the Pret Corporation's ability to do that.

Matthew
01:04:32
My problem with the Christmas sandwiches is I'm not a big cranberry guy. Ah. Yeah. And that's always in there, but it's never part of my c I I'm surprised that it's that universal because I've been at loads of cr you know I've been at precisely 40 Christmas dinners. And uh I've seen how many people do and don't have the cranberry, and it isn't like universal enough that I would put it in every Christmas sandwich. Yeah, exactly. I'd say it's a 50-50 split at our table, and always has been.

Samuel
01:05:03
I don't think We've ever had cranberry at a Christmas dinner of mine. It's it's never.

Matthew
01:05:08
So why are we putting it in the fucking sandwich? Why does everything need to taste of berries?

Samuel
01:05:11
Because it's a cheap ingredient. to give it a bit of a a a different flavour really.

Matthew
01:05:15
To disguise the nasty, nasty turkey.

Samuel
01:05:18
Yeah, and the like the very pared-down sort of like pigs in blanket experience those sandwiches try to give you It's got yeah, it's pretty it's like a lot a selection of grey meats and then a bit of like cranberry sauce is what those sandwiches are. They're very, very disappointing. Um, I will tell you one very like backpage coded thing that I'm doing for this Christmas, Matthew, is uh after I go to Gav Murphy's Christmas lunch. I'm going to another Christmas dinner in the evening with my ex-Frontier pals. So I'm like comboing dinners. On the way back, I mean I have to get a replacement bus back. I'm just gonna be like either trapped in the National Express coach toilet or just lying in the recovery position. There's no other way that that that day. There's no trains back that day. It's like not I I'm getting like the last train back basically. Like it's I wanna I want to make a night of it with with some pals, so um we'll see how it goes. But two dinners seems like a very backpage thing to do, doesn't it? So uh Double Dinner Double dinner and um that will be that Matthew. And my last question before we get into the Panto bit, do you remember when you stopped believing in Santa Claus? Uh I never believed in Santa Claus. No, uh Sossed it out from the start.

Matthew
01:06:32
I don't know, eight or nine?

Samuel
01:06:34
Yeah, I I think I was like closer to ten

Matthew
01:06:37
kind of the range. We always had stockings. You start getting stuff in the stockings which is so obviously from like the human world rather than the fantastical North Pole. Yeah. Like a Terry's chocolate orange. You know. Father Christmas, what does he doesn't have access to Gamesmaster? Why is that in the stocking? And that's that's really when you start questioning it heavily, is like Why is he why is he drawing on so much stuff which is also within walking distance of our house?

Samuel
01:07:07
Yeah, I I was a bit older and my mum still would never admit to like Santa Claus is not real. She'd never admit to it. Even like 13-14. She was like, if you don't believe, you might not get a PlayStation 2. And it's like, well, I don't know. Did Santa Claus really pick out 007 Nightfire on Christmas Day 2001? I don't think it's a good thing. And and did Father Christmas lay down the scavenger hunt to find it? Yeah, exactly. So it's um yeah, but I do remember thinking Christmas was like Uh the a bit of the magic was lost um a little bit. Um that's yeah, that said I'd wake up the next day and unwrap a Game Boy colour and Marry a brothers deluxe and be like actually, you know what, the magic of Christmas is good and well, so uh it's all right. Um but yes.

Matthew
01:07:50
Yeah, I because I've got I've got younger brothers and sisters quite a big age gap. We obviously still did the whole thing. you know, keep keep the myth alive for them for a long time. So um, you know, I felt like we still had a good dose of it in our house and we had like I had like a stocking until I was like thirty or something. It was great. I think I still have one to be honest. And I'm 38 next year, so Oh man, I wish I still had one.

Samuel
01:08:15
Yeah, we still buy gifts and stuff in the family, but it's I do look forward to it as more of a food event now than anything. And also the thing I've been doing to my little brother ever since like Christmas twenty twenty two, which is putting on fifty minutes of Peter Jackson's Beatles documentary and just a bit of like Ringo Star and company sat around sort of mumbling and my little brother going, This is the most boring thing ever. I hate this. But it's such a good Christmas thing to do. is to chip away that documentary. I think I'm like just started episode three of it, which is the last episode. But I've already been threatening it with it w with with him with it and being like, I'm gonna put on episode three of the Beatles this year and he's like, oh fuck off. And you know my brother never swears at anything, but he's like, stop doing this please. Um that's such a good tradition. It is good, yeah. I do enjoy yeah. It's 'cause it's about nine hours long. And not all of it is essential content. So uh yeah. Okay, Matthew, on to the panto bit then. Deep breaths. Oh. Put it off. I have long enough. Um, we are returning Matthew Castle Productions and Big Sammy Holdings are returning to the Panto industry after dubious returns in 2024. Before we get started, Matthew, from last year, have you now acknowledged that the characters of Ping and Pong were in fact racist caricatures? Has that that been hard to live with, that that truth?

Matthew
01:09:31
Yeah, I mean I I didn't create that convention. No, of course not. No. It didn't dawn on me until we were doing the episode that some of uh some of the Aladdin tropes are problematic in the year twenty twenty-four.

Samuel
01:09:46
Yeah, it happens, you know, um elements of British life that are problematic. Um okay Matthew, so we have seven categories here. I'll go through them one by one and we will each describe the panto that we're doing this year. Where we're hosting it, etc. So what play have you selected for this year, Matthew?

Matthew
01:10:04
I have picked, rather daringly, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. That's a lot of characters to film, man. That's a lot of jokes you gotta come up with. It's and it's an inc an increasingly controversial pick. I feel like it often goes wrong when people return to this this particular story and there's not really a correct way of doing it. But if anyone can delicately tread this line, it will be us in this podcast.

Samuel
01:10:28
Definitely. Um I've gone with Peter Pan, Matthew.

Matthew
01:10:31
Okay.

Samuel
01:10:32
Which I was really dismayed to learn doesn't have a drag character. Which is like the only point of doing Panto, isn't it? Is you get like a bloke who used to be on the telly. in the eighties and then you put them in a dress. And that's the whole point of doing it, isn't it? That's like why else are we here? What are we doing here? You know?

Matthew
01:10:47
So so I've added a drag character.

Samuel
01:10:50
Um w do do not worry about that. I've imported one from another play, but we'll get to that Matthew. Um which venue will you be hosting, uh Snow White the Seventh Wars at Matthew?

Matthew
01:11:00
Oh, this is terrible. This is off to such a bad start, my answer to this one. Go on. So it's just not f it's just not funny. It's so shit. I came up with it five minutes before we started our double recording. I knew that was gonna happen.

Samuel
01:11:20
Yeah, exactly.

Matthew
01:11:20
So I was thinking Snow White, I was thinking Magic Mirror, um, and I was thinking of like, well where would be an unusual place for there to be a pantomime? And so I thought I I swore there was a place called the Hall of Mirrors. There is in the Palace of Versailles. So I picked that. But that's just fucking rubbish.

Samuel
01:11:40
It's meant to be British Pantomy. What's it in the Palace of Versailles? What's that got to do with this? But why would it be there? Is it live streamed? Can you go watch it in the little theatre? I don't I don't know. Okay. factu eras, me googling things in the middle of the episode, that this is the second of two podcasts we've recorded this evening. You're actually getting the second one first. And then the um alternative game of the year awards we recorded just before this. I mean, to be for context, we started recording at 6. 15. It is now 20 to 10. So we've been going at it for almost four hours, hence the flagging energy level, St. Matthew picking Versailles for the location of his panto, which I think is wonderful. Okay, so I've picked um the King's Theatre Portsmouth, Matthew. And Okay, that's more like Well yeah, it's sort of sa it's in South Sea, there's some nice pubs nearby. You know, I I'm familiar with it. And I thought I'd look up what the actual King's Theatre Portsmouth was doing. I can do that with mine, you see, because the Palace of Versailles is not hosting a pantomime. So I looked it up and they're doing Alatin. And I couldn't have asked for like a more here with um the star is um Sean Williamson, um aka Barry from EastEnders. And um on the poster it says um EastEnders and Extras Legend. That's how he's described. But they spelled extras with an apostrophe, so there's a mistake in there. And I'm like, that's that's perfect. So um well done. That's good. And then a load of people off the telly I've never heard of. See the body I think he might be I think he might be the genie actually. Um which would kind of make sense. But um I mean if you are in the Portsmouth area and you are planning on going, um write in and let us know. Was he the genie? Or in fact the baddie, let us know. Um you have to consult with a game designer of your choice to write or design your panthe. Matthew, who you get involved?

Matthew
01:13:34
Well, after last year's very confusing production of Aladdin, which was, let me remind you, held in a theatre sliding down a slope. For the whole production from Devil May Cry 5. Yeah, that was good. Uh we're going back to basics. So I'm gonna get Tim Schaefer to write me some killer gags, just like funny up the script. uh but I thought I'd get or maybe I was thinking on the Versailles lines I'd get the Sandfall art department to bring their uh Bella Pox style to uh to our framing of uh Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. The voice which basically means add some curly bits to the dwarfs got it.

Samuel
01:14:10
A whole studio's contribution to the video games called and boiled down to some curly bits. I mean, great stuff. That's my interpretation of what Bella Pock means. Well you you are so far from what a panto is at this point. Like Bellapop should be anywhere near a panto.

Matthew
01:14:26
What's that got to do with it? It's a pantomime in the palace of a side.

Samuel
01:14:30
At that point, it's just a some kind of work of like um Modern art, isn't it, or something? It's not really once we get to the cast, I think we're back in Panto world. Okay, I look forward to it. Um, okay, so Um I'm employing for my Peter Pan adaptation um Ryukishi07 Matthew, who is going to um structure the play, so you have to watch it four times to get to get all the scenes and the correct ending. So Yeah, bringing a bit of Silent Hill F energy to um to proceedings.

Matthew
01:14:59
Um I thought you'd be like, the first time you're like Captain Hook's the villain, but by the end you realize he's alright, or will it be vice versa? How's that gonna work?

Samuel
01:15:08
Um, I think it's uh well, I mean uh w were that I thought that far ahead to be honest. Um yeah, okay, sure. Let let's go with that. It's a bit like near automata where like you'll be like, oh shit, like the the real villain was sort of like man and what it did to what we did to these rave. The real villain was SME all along. Well, that's the thing. So the Each um each version of the play will take place from a like take place from a different perspective. So by the end of it you have a rich tapestry and you get to decide Who are the heroes? Who are the villains? Are there even heroes and villains? Or is this a story of black and white? The answer is no, it's a pantomime, and the villains are the villains.

Matthew
01:15:46
I like the idea that on the first lap everyone's shouting, he's behind you, and on the second lap we get to find out what actually was behind him.

Samuel
01:15:53
Yeah, exactly. That's perfect. Um he's in front of you because the perspective has changed. Oh dear. Um and now we get to the more important bit of this, Matthew. Um who's your star? Who's a star of Snow White? And the seven dwarfs as presented by Sandfall Interactive at the Palace of Versailles.

Matthew
01:16:14
The star I took to be Snow White, our main character. Yep. I did this purely on looks. I picked Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite.

Samuel
01:16:22
Oh yeah, that's uh that's good. A woman who's trapped in a big bird thing. That's good. I think that's a good thing. Black hair. She's quite I'd say she's quite Disney coded that design. Yeah, I think that's a good pick actually. She is very snow white. It's yeah, it's good. Good choice. Um Okay, so I'm Peter Pan. Uh my Peter Pan is played by played by Diddy Kong. So we're right. Well he's sort of a perpetual child, Diddy Kong, isn't he? He never gets to become anything but Diddy Kong So uh I really hope Wendy is also a monkey or it's gonna be some like awkward kissing scenes. Well I don't wanna spoil it, but she's not actually.

Matthew
01:16:57
So uh Okay, good. You can look forward to that. Oh dear. You know when people get passing these things, they must look at their opposite, you know, their other half and think, oh, I hope it's someone I like. I hope I don't have to like make out with some you know, some asshole actor. Uh going to the table read and realizing it's Diddy Cole.

Samuel
01:17:19
It's like this is a serious production. I think Diddy Kong is a good match for the Portsmouth Theatre scene to be honest. Um I think that's correct, Matthew. So uh yes, we now move on to who are the other characters, Matthews, and who plays who plays them.

Matthew
01:17:32
Snow White obviously needs an evil queen. Yep. Very kind of like sort of cut glass accent, kind of sinister energy. Diana Burnwood from Hitman. Alright, okay.

Samuel
01:17:43
Not not instantly recognizable physically, but the voice, certainly.

Matthew
01:17:46
You could imagine the voice, couldn't you, saying, you know, mirror, mirror on the wall. Oh yes, that's good.

Samuel
01:17:52
You sound like a man who's practiced that voice several times, I would say.

Matthew
01:18:00
Okay. Fair enough. Um you you're just that good Uh okay. Oh who else you got Matthew? I got a magic mirror, so the face that floats in the mirror. It just needs to be a head, so that's Andros from Star Fox.

Samuel
01:18:12
True form or like the OG monkey version? Uh let's say true form. Or the brain with eyes.

Matthew
01:18:19
Yeah. That's fucked up. So it's Diana Burnwood addressing Andros.

Samuel
01:18:27
To think you were cynical about doing this episode again. Uh but here we are.

Matthew
01:18:30
Well, I mean it looked a bit iffy when around the Palace of Versailles bit away. Yeah, it was dicey then. Uh Prince, we just need like a young handsome dude. Uh it's quite hard to pick a funny one for that. I just went with that that new James Bond. Oh yeah. Uh the Irish guy. That guy. Yeah, yeah.

Samuel
01:18:48
Um anyone else?

Matthew
01:18:50
Yeah, uh there is a dame in Snow White. Th they always change the character, but it's just it's like someone who's mates with Snow White basically Um, I was trying to think of someone who had like dame energy. I've picked that thing with a big tongue from Final Fantasy IX, Quinna. Yeah, Quinna does have dame energy, actually. I think Quinna does have big dame energy. I don't really know like what Quinnna's deal is. Appar apparently they are j it's genderless, Quinna, so that's that should be fine for a dame.

Samuel
01:19:19
Matthew carefully trying not to get himself cancelled there on Blue Sky. That's good.

Matthew
01:19:23
Just try not to misgender Quinnna. Um uh the dame has uh a comedy son called Muddles, who I think is in love with Snow White, apparently. Okay. I was looking at some posters for Snow White trying and try and work out exactly who should be in this. Right. Uh for models, uh that's got big Luigi energy. Okay. I can see sort of idiots um being kind of bashfully in love with Elizabeth from Bioshock.

Samuel
01:19:51
Oh yeah, I see that. I think Luigi would be into her. I think he'd dig her deal.

Matthew
01:19:54
And then we have the seven dwarves.

Samuel
01:19:56
Yeah. See I thought you were gonna do the wonderful one oh one dwarves. I thought I was what you're gonna go with here, Matthew. I thought it's gonna be the ultimate castle.

Matthew
01:20:04
I've picked seven legendary video. Game dwarves. Oh, okay, go on. Zoltan Shivay from the Witcher series. Nice, don't know him, but I see what's good. Broken Sindri from God of War. Mm-hmm. Pierce 2 era Gimli. Perfect. Low Rares Gimli. Varek from Dragon Age. My guy. Beast from Divinity Original Sin 2. Nice. And our seventh horse is uh every kid's favorite. It is of course, Corgan Bloodaxe from Baldur's Gate 2. Yeah, kids love that guy. Um yes, okay, very good.

Samuel
01:20:36
That's that's very well thought out, actually. That is like seven authentic dwarves. Yeah, well done. We're all we're we're all very impressed. Um so that's good. Um is that all the is that the whole cast now Matthew?

Matthew
01:20:46
That is the whole cast. I mean I had to come up with seven dwarves.

Samuel

Yes, uh that's a big lift. You did you really brought it there, I think. And they are all now on their way to the Palace of Versailles. And uh yeah, I look forward to seeing uh seeing this immensely. Okay, so my characters then. Um yeah, as mentioned, Peter Pan played by Diddy Kong. Um Tinkerbell is played by Morgana from Persona 5. I think she has a bit of tink. Tinkerbell energy. Wait, it's a he's a boy, right, Morgana. But um I just always f phantomes can be pretty it's pretty flexible. Yeah, we're just gonna gender flip that role. Um nonetheless. I think Morgana's perfect for Tinkerbell. Um We've got Pyramid Head as Captain Hook. He is also the representation of adulthood that Peter Pan fears so much, which is true to the Disney telling of that story. Where I think Captain Hook is like is he a bit like the dad or something like that? I can't remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um then we've got um SME is a duel role played by um LGBTQ plus icons Team Rocket from the Pokemon anime, Jesse and James. Um so that's that's me in this. Um Wendy Wendy who's gonna be getting it on with um Diddy Kong apparently, as Matthew pointed out. It's played by Pinky from Promise Mascot Agency. A thumb and a monkey. Perfect. No no no notice so far Um, and as mentioned, we do lack uh Dame in this. I've imported the um the character Widow Twanky from Aladdin into this. Um but they'll be known as the Widow Cranky, Cranky Kong that is, Matthew. And that's that rather pretty much rounds out our cast. So um what do you make of all that? I mean there's a lot of animals.

Matthew
01:22:26
Uh it's like absolute chaos really. There's several monkeys, there's a there's a f a fairy cat and a giant sliced off digit. Uh I I think that's gonna be upsetting for the kids.

Samuel
01:22:39
Well, I think when I read all this out I thought, do you know what? Aladdin with Sean Williamson doesn't sound so bad compared to this. to be honest. So um yeah okay and then also some cartoon characters from a Pokemon anime so that's not uh that's not ideal either. But uh yeah and pyramid head that is quite upsetting too so But again, I think it ties into the the looping narrative theme and the the weird sort of like spooky vibes uh undercurrent that they're gonna go into Go into all this nonsense. And now um anything else to note about your panto, Matthew?

Matthew
01:23:09
Uh when Snow White eats the poison apple and falls asleep, we're gonna pump sleeping gas into the auditorium slash the Palace of Versailles. To knock out all the kids so that the parents can have a nice drink in the interval in peace.

Samuel
01:23:21
Fair enough, okay. Um bit sinister, but Hey go hey ho. Um all you need to know about my one tickets are fifteen pound plus VAT and you get a free bottle of lemonade and a a packet of crisp flavour of your choice at the entrance. So uh Take your pick. We're we're out of uh smoky bacon and we're out of cheese and onion, but we've still got prawn cocktails, so uh help myself. This is some incredible world building. I would say it's true to the Portsmouth uh theatre experience this bit. So um Yes. And finally Matthew, what do you think cric uh critics will make of it?

Matthew
01:23:52
The Guardian will write, I can't believe they gassed all those children while Time Out says, Who knew Corgon Bloodaxe had such a sweet singing voice?

Samuel
01:24:02
Very good. Um and for my one, um gets one out of five from the Portsmouth evening news, which I assume is down to like one reporter these days. Um and the mayor of um the city bans me from ever entering Portsmouth again. And I'm forced to walk the plank at Gun Wharf Keys, Peter Pan style. Um so and I don't fly, I just I just I just tumble into the harbour and get thumped by a Peter No Ferry um that's going past. And that's um That's into me. That's the end of you. That's into me. Yeah. So that's the um that's the panto for this year, Matthew. A series of labored gags and the odd um actual laugh. And um that very much brings us to the end of this episode. So um one of our more chaotic ones. All over the place, really. Why did I ask more Christmas questions in the second half and not in the first half? That was completely bad podcast structuring, really. Um, but uh Nonetheless, um it was enjoyable. Uh I hope that you, the listener, enjoyed it. Um the listener, um, listeners, uh plural. Um, but yes, thank you very much for listening. We'll be back next week, as mentioned, with the alternative game of the year awards and perhaps another treat that will be uh will be well who can really say Matthew let's keep that a surprise shall we And uh yeah, you know where you can get us on social media. So we'll just say thank you for your support and remind you that the XXL episode this month, coming right at the end of the month. On the thirty-first, not the usual day that these podcasts drop, I think it's a Wednesday this uh this year um is gonna be our best uh TV shows and movies of the year. Um so look forward to that. And uh yes, Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye. Goodbye
