Hello, this is Samuel Roberts from The Back Page. We're taking the week off this week to recharge ahead of 2023, where we'll be rolling out new episodes. So for the free feed this week, we wanted to give all of our free listeners a chance to listen to the stuff we make on Patreon at patreon.com/backpagepod.
This is the first ever Excel episode we made back in April. It's called Best Boss Battles, pretty self-explanatory. Over on Patreon, we make two additional podcasts a month for our listeners, the Excel episodes and the XXL episodes.
So, Excel's all about games, XXL's all about pop culture. So, we've done everything from Star Wars movies ranked to best Metal Gear moments, our favorite E3 moments, best Zelda moments, lots of moments, you'll notice, but also best TV shows of the century, a massive array of stuff. Matthew did his episode on Japanese crime fiction, which is really good, but the hard sell is over.
If you'd like to support us financially, you can, patreon.com/backpagepod. But if you'd like to support us in the free feed, we'd love a review on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, if you could spare a moment. But either way, I hope you enjoy this episode and happy new year from us.
Thank you so much for your support.
Hello, and welcome to The Back Page XL, a Patreon-exclusive episode of The Back Page Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello. Is it joined as ever, as this is technically the first one?
Oh yeah, I guess not. I just very used to saying that, conditioned in my own way.
People probably like to hear that. It reassures them that they're listening to a nice sort of continuing through line of the podcast.
Yeah, exactly. Now, for the people at home, you may think this is about the best boss battles in games, but it's actually two hours about sandwich shops and bars. So we're gonna start with the whole bagels entire menu.
Then we'll get around to John Denton's photo of Intermezzo and what that says about our taste in sandwich shops, Matthew.
Strap in.
I'm joking, of course. So Matthew, any thoughts on what we're doing on Patreon? I think it's like about time, right?
We make a fairly beefy podcast. We want people to be able to support us if they like it. We're not asking them to pay unless they can afford it, but we really appreciate having people listen.
Do you have any kind of thoughts on the whole enterprise?
Glad that we're doing it, doing a bit of extra stuff. It's not like we were on desperate times or anything, and I think we'd still make the podcast, well, we would still make the main podcast if Patreon ended up being a massive, massive bust, but we commit quite a lot of time to it, and I think that started off with just it wanting to be really good and wanting the podcast to be well researched and not just kind of like pulled out of our ass every week. And actually kind of keeping up that level, requires quite a big time investment.
So it would be nice to have a little bit of scratch.
Yeah, exactly, yeah. So how it kind of works is we're basically setting up two tiers of podcasts, but you'll all get them for the same price. If you're listening to this, basically if the overall Patreon number hits about 600 pounds, I think we agreed, we will look at doing a second podcast a month that'll be more generally pop culture focused.
And in theory, we should have put out some kind of roadmap that explains what we'll do in year one if we hit the numbers. So that's kind of what you've got to look forward to. And yeah, we hope that people will enjoy the kind of like deep dive so we go into these episodes.
I'd be a little bit, I guess like adjacent to what we do in the main podcast, but a chance to talk about some cool subjects too, and reward listeners who want to back us at that level. So Matthew, this is it then. Our first Patreon episode is about the best boss battles in games.
Not talked about boss battles that much, apart from the old God in Space thing, and the occasional mention when a game does come up. As a good starting point here, do you remember the first boss battle in a game that really fucked you up?
Probably just be like the first boss battle I encountered full stop. Which in my head is the not particularly scary in hindsight, Birdo in Super Mario Brothers 2. Not even a full fat boss, it's a mini boss.
I think there's something about those older games that when you hit a boss fight, you know, for the first time, the rhythm of the game changes. The fact that screen stops moving and you're kind of locked in and it might play some sinister music. And that stuff actually, when you're a kid, I think lands pretty hard.
It's very anxiety-inducing.
Yeah, I think that kind of tallies for my experience. It's like a boss, my kind of like early memories of bosses are when they appear, it's a surprise. And when they do appear, it's this moment of like absolute panic and then like messing it up three times before realising you have to do the entire level again.
Like that's kind of my early experience of bosses, I guess. And then, yeah.
The stakes are higher back then because everything's like roar-er in terms of like, you know, A, emotionally, you're in a more fragile place as a younger person. And also because games are, I was going to say rope here, that's not fair. Because older games, you know, are a bit less accommodating in terms of checkpoints and things like that.
It's the stakes are just generally much higher. This could feasibly be the thing you'll never get past. I only ever stopped playing a game because of a boss.
There wouldn't be any other reason, I think.
The first boss battle that really fucked me up was, I had Mega Bomberman on the Mega Drive. I don't know if you know this game. It's also known as Bomberman 94, I think it is.
It had like a sort of slightly Zelda-y, it's hard to categorize, but like a single player campaign, like a bunch of levels and single player maps where you blew up blocks and then blew up enemies, then got to the end and tried to collect coins, and it was fairly straightforward. And there were boss levels in those, you kind of like put together, you collected a piece of these different sort of like stone tablet things in each level. And then when they're all put together, a boss would arrive at the end.
And there was this big fucker period mid man who turned up at the end of one of them. And he could like basically like, he was like a pyramid for a head.
He's not pyramid head.
No, I mean, he is pyramid head theoretically, but not in actuality. So he had a pyramid for a head is what I'm saying. But he was pyramid for a head.
Then he had a really beefy stone arms. And from these arms, these little kind of shoulder, sort of like hatches at the top would open. And he'd fire these rockets into the end.
They kind of rained down like fire on Bomberman. And I remember thinking that was bullshit, trying to avoid that. And like that was another game that you had to start again if you lost to a boss in that.
And it was just an absolute fuck show. So you lost all your power ups. You could start the level again, like back to the beginning of the act, but you would lose all of your power ups, including your ability to drop multiple bombs and your ability to like the extended like blast range of your bombs and like laying multiple bombs at once.
Like all these abilities you'd built up, the game just went, nah, fuck you. You can do it even harder. Now that you've failed, you can do it in a harder way.
And it's like brilliant.
It's the original rogue-like.
Basically, Make a Bomberman was my first encounter with a boss where I just thought, oh, this is shit. How old are we talking here? I must have been like 95, something like that.
Maybe, yeah, that sounds about right in terms of when I kind of got into games. But yeah, and before that, I mentioned on the Kirby episode that I played Kirby's Dream Land. That didn't really have any motherfucker bosses.
I think I killed King Dedede, whatever he's called, on the first go. And that tree fucker was always quite easy to beat. So yeah, that was never too bad.
But yeah, Bomberman fucked me up. Sonic bosses I always found very eventy, the original Sonic game. But like, they were never that hard.
They were pretty easy, the bosses in Sonic 1.
So yeah. Good effects on Robotnik's sort of earth. He had that sort of spherical sort of demolition ball.
It was like a sort of 3D ball. It was like a little taste of 3D or, and that always looked quite cool.
Yeah. It also-
Yeah, very easy. Very easy to bust, bust his chops.
Yeah. Even like the final boss in Sonic 1 is pretty simple. You just have to avoid like some laser beamy things and then just like get him when he's little pneumatic, sort of like prod thingies just kind of go up and down.
Really hard to explain that boss on the audio, I'll be honest. But-
But then they balance it out in Sonic 2 by making you fight basically an impossible giant mech.
Yeah, I was going to save him for a slightly later the conversation.
Well, we can park that thought.
No spoilers, but he didn't make my list of the best bosses, Matthew, I'll be honest. Sonic 2 mech motherfucker, I didn't make the list. So, what do you think makes a good boss battle, Matthew?
The kind of purest, most obvious version of this is, you know, it's like a big mechanical test. It's like where it takes everything that the game's about and steps it up a notch, you know, so that's, and that's, you know, games are obviously all about different things. So there's lots of different versions of this.
More often than not, I think it's a test of mastery of like what that game's about. Maybe throws in some like wrinkles you haven't seen. It's often like the technical standout moment.
It's, you know, whether that's because the boss is massive or you're just trying to put on a light show, but they, everything kind of ramps up in that sense. And also like narratively, I guess, they're kind of key points because it's where the story tends to happen. It's like you're a reward for doing the level, isn't it?
These things are truer of some games than others in ways.
Yeah, so I broke it down to three things. Three, what I think are three kind of cornerstones. I think it's a mix of clever mechanics, framing, and spectacle.
So a good boss can get by on any of those alone, if they're done really well. But a great boss usually has two of the three, I would say. So mechanics, of course, is something that plays on your knowledge of the game and how you can use that knowledge of the game applied to an enemy, whether it's how you kill it or how to use environment around it, something like that, something that's like a slight spin on what you've played before.
Framing is more about the lead up to a boss or the setting, or how it's placed in the story, I think. Sometimes the knowledge that the boss is coming, or that it's something along the way, or just the setting itself is a big part of it. And then the spectacle element, I think, is just like, what will the boss itself actually do that's impressive?
That ties into what you're saying about, usually it's the technical standout. I think that applies here, where it's like, will the boss change into a second form that's really cool and really fucked up? Will this really blow me away audiovisually?
And I think that those are the different things. And so it's funny, because in my top five, some of those have all three, some of them just have two. None of them just have one, actually, but I think somewhere between those three is where a great boss battle lies, you know?
Yeah, when I said talking on a technical level, I guess I should probably expand that to just general artistry as well, because often bosses have the music that goes so hard, and that's where, you know, the soundtracks, these things are really embedded in your skull. I was gonna say, actually, when we were talking about the first bosses that really messed us up, another game which really sticks with me for this is Quack Shot on the Mega Drive. He's like Indiana Jones, but he's Donald Duck.
And don't know if we even got past the second boss, like a big fat tiger that looked like Shere Khan, and when it jumped, you had to shoot it upwards to hit its belly. You should find the Quack Shot boss medley on YouTube. And it's just funny seeing lots of people at the moment talk about like Elden Ring and From Software, and they often bring up the music.
They're like, oh, this character's theme, like when he steps it up a notch, it becomes the ultimate game theme tune. And nothing in that game is as scary to me as the music that plays when I'm trying to shoot a Shere Khan in his tummy in Quack Shot. But it's just got like the Mega Drive sound chip, what they have to play with has just got a very old, evil sounding tone to it.
Yeah, I think sound is like a really key part of it, particularly with the earlier games. Tell you something like Links of Wightling, for example, which has that boss scene that goes, da, da, da. And then like, meanwhile, every time you hit the enemy, it goes, oh, like that.
And like the combination of those sounds, and then the do, where your tiny link just gets absolutely fucked up. Like that combination of sounds is like responsible for most of the drama in those bosses, because, you know, it's just a little sprite or like an eyeball on the screen or whatever, you know.
If I was ever really stuck on a boss fight, the first thing I'd do is just mute it and just try and play it in silence, because so much of the soundtrack is about like, yeah, raising your pulse, stressing you out. And it's, you know, the test of a lot of boss fights is just being calm and not letting your brain freak out, even though the game's doing everything and it's power to say, you should be scared, you should be freaking out. It's a giant snake.
It's going faster and faster. It's probably not going faster, just the music is. And you screw yourself over.
Old Zelda does a lot of that stuff.
Yeah, for sure. So I guess like another question along these lines of Matthew's, what do you think makes a bad boss battle?
A fight which like doesn't follow the rules of the game or like introduces something that you just can't get your head around. Where the good boss fight is sort of the ultimate test and kind of brings everything together. These ones sort of go in a different direction.
I mean, the really obvious example here is like Deus Ex Human Revolution. You know, you spend that game playing as you want and the game is celebrated that. And it celebrates you for playing how you want.
And it gets these boss fights, which in its original form didn't have a kind of stealth approaches. You know, it forced out and out combat in a game where you could potentially have not engaged with any out and out combat. Cheap is the word, where it doesn't feel like you've got any chance or it doesn't feel like it's playing fair or that you have the tools you need to kind of deal with something.
I guess then the other thing as well is like, like there's a lot of bad etiquette around boss battles, given that they are difficulty spikes. And this is more to do with them as difficulty spikes than inherently as boss battles. If you know someone's going to be replaying something a lot because it's hard, not making them sit through cut scenes beforehand or not making them replay a great stretch of the game to get to it and have one shot of dying.
But that isn't so much about the fight, it's more about how you kind of place the fight in the game.
What I noted here is that like bad boss battles tend to be where the game has bent its own internal logic around the need to have a boss battle. So I think what you say about one-off mechanics to a good point, like your Uncharted boss fights and the like, very obvious example of this. And like right up to Uncharted 4, which had the old kind of sword combat thing that wasn't in the rest of the game, it just kind of is where the game falls down a little bit.
The kind of classic example of like a game bending its own internal logic and rules around the need to have a boss battle. The concept of a boss battle is Bioshock, I would say. It's like the game was relatively low-key for what it was.
And then you have to fight like this superhero-type man at the end, and it's just kind of preposterous and not particularly satisfying and like undermines Atlas as the villain in that game, because otherwise he was such a good threatening villain.
Yeah, yeah, that was weird.
That's tough. But then another one is Bioshock Infinite's Lady Comstock fight at the end, where you're just shooting that ghost over and over again, and it's just like antithetical to what else that game did very, very well. Deus Ex Human Revolution is another example of this.
Even the original Deus Ex had bosses, though, like technically, like Gunther and Andavara from UNATCO, like those agents who come after you. One way to kill them is just to absolutely like lob grenades at them and to just shoot them endlessly until they explode. Now, the other thing is, of course, this is Deus Ex, so you can actually type in a kill switch to take down both of them, which is when they added the director's cut stuff to Human Revolution, they went in and added conversation options to do the bosses, which is like a nice way of kind of like putting it a bit more towards that Deus Ex kind of thing.
But that's it, I think. It's where the game logic feels a bit too warped to accommodate a boss fight. That's where they fall down, where it's like, I feel like you are conscious of the idea that you need a boss fight, and so you've made the game, you've just taken the game too far from what it's good at to make it work, you know?
That's kind of where I'm at.
Yeah, I think that's fair. Incidentally, I see so many people celebrate role-playing games where they have the talk option, but at the same time, that is quite anticlimactic way to finish a game, where you just go in and tell a mad computer to kill itself or something. Good on me, I guess, for getting my stats up that high.
There still has to be some kind of challenge. The idea of just pressing a dialogue choice and then the game kind of completes itself because you invested enough in charisma or whatever. That appears in a lot of PC gaming lists, things like Fallout or even the Outer Worlds recently.
Outer Worlds, whichever one isn't the galaxy time travel one. But to me, that kind of stuff leaves me cold. It's quite dweeby that it works, but I don't know.
That feels more like an Easter egg than something I actually want to be doing.
I'm with you on the overly hard thing as well. I think that a difficulty spike that makes you think what's the point is kind of like just a real bummer, especially when it feels out of whack with the rest of the game experience. So one example I pulled out of this is a game I otherwise love, which is FTL, where at the end of the game, you have to fight this rebel flagship.
And it's like a spaceship with multiple chunks of it, basically, you have to shoot off and destroy. And even on easy mode, I never, ever finished it. And I just thought it was way too harsh for what it was.
If you can't finish it on easy mode, that boss is probably too hard. And I played that game for about a hundred hours. So I don't know.
Yeah. And so it's like, that kind of bums me out. Cause I think I'm like, I don't think I'm amazing at games.
I think I'm reasonably good. And so I felt like I was never even close to being powered enough to get there. Once I got there, my ship was quite badly damaged from going through eight worlds with like random events and spaceship battles.
And then it's like, you don't get to the end and it's a super empowering moment. You get to the end and it's like, well, my thing that's basically held together with duct tape is about to be blown out of the stars by like this gigantic spaceship. Oh well, better start another run.
And like, it's funny cause they got better. They don't, they do have a sort of boss of sorts in the follow-up game Into the Breach, but it's fairly easy to beat on easy mode. And there's like a reward.
There's a kind of continuous story element to Into the Loop, Into the Breach, sorry, Into the Breach. There's a reward for doing that. You send like another pilot to another timeline to help them fight the monsters there and it kind of like loops quite nicely.
And that's better than just giving people a boss that they're stumped on and they kind of might go away from the game thinking, it's a shame I can never see the end of this game that I otherwise love, you know?
I guess like in people's, in designer's heads, there's some attractiveness to the idea of a absolutely split-second, breathless, like photo finish, where you just get it across the line and, you know, the sense of relief would be so massive that you'd come away and this would be one of your most cherished gaming memories of all times. But the balancing act to that is, you know, it's difficult. If you get it wrong, you're just gonna really, really upset people.
Like I've played, it's not video game, but I've played the board game of Battlestar Galactica a few times. And I don't know if you've ever played the board game of Battlestar Galactica.
No, I haven't, actually. Go ahead.
Okay, so it's like the show. You're just part of the fleet and you're trying to escape psalons to find like a new earth or a new home for humanity. The fundamental aim of the game is to get to a certain destination or I don't think it's like survive X turns.
I think it is like you jump between planets on every turn or something, but you have like psalons in pursuit and there are also sort of psalons embedded in your team and they're sort of selected by secret at the start. It's really good. It really captures the like excitement of, you know, who's a psalon of the early seasons without going into all the kind of weird sort of religious bullshit.
Final five bullshit.
Yeah.
It's like, oh no, I just drew the final five card. It's going to throw the entire game into disarray and make it not very fun for three seasons.
Well, it does reveal more secret psalons as the game goes on.
Right, right.
So it follows some of that. Well, it's good because you could have elected someone like president of earth and then they turn out to be a psalon and then they basically just like crash Balster into the sun and you're like, well, great. That was on us.
But that, I've lost every time I've played utterly because the psalons can just absolutely like, they can do so much to sort of sabotage the ship. It's really, really hard to win. But one time we won on like one final like roll of the dice where you basically just gamble everything on like a last ditch attempt.
And I remember after that thinking, oh, if there was a game that could capture that sensation of like, this is it, it's all or nothing. I'm putting everything on the line here and it just worked. But the downside to that is, it's like balancing something like that would prove so difficult.
And most people would just end in such tear streaks frustration.
Yeah, I saw like another boss I'm not very fond of that was kind of just had that vibe was the final boss of Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, which is, that's that music playing in the background. That's the like, Nanomachine's son guy, I believe.
Yeah, Armstrong, fuck that guy.
Yeah, that's just like, it's just, it's really bad. It's kind of a shame because from Platinum, who, you know, have made very good bosses in the past, but like, sometimes these bosses can just be like a headache and an endless sort of struggle.
And like, he's held up as like a legit great boss as well.
I don't get that. I don't really think any of the bosses in that game are memorable. But yeah, I just, I was not, not into his whole vibe.
He's ever, like, you know, I was doing lots of research for this, just to sort of see what other people were into and, you know, what kind of stuff kind of appeared again and again. And he is regularly up there. And at first they thought, oh, it's cause it's a meme, cause of a nanomachine sun and all that.
But actually, no, people are like, oh, it's this really mechanically interesting. It's like the ultimate test. It's like, it's absolutely dire.
That's one of the few games I've reviewed where I remember sitting there going, every time I die in this boss, I take off a percent of the score every single time until we get down to what this game fundamentally is. I hate it. I hated the end of that game.
I think it's Platinum's worst lost boss by an absolute mile.
I would also argue as well, there's something about the mechanics of that game, like the cutting up stuff that suits regular enemies more than it suits bosses. And that happens sometimes. But something like Bayonetta, I would argue, is actually kind of perfect at balancing it.
It's like the skillset you have is well-suited to every enemy you fight in the game. Whereas, like I say, I think the appeal of slicing an enemy up and ripping out that blue thing from inside them is kind of what the loop of Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is. And it's not really about amazing combos and that side of it, that super skilled, loads of upgrades side of it where you customize your fighting style.
It's a bit more just like, I don't know, I just didn't get any joy from those bosses, which is the opposite of how I feel about Metal Gear bosses and the opposite of how I feel about Platinum bosses generally. So yeah, I agree with you. I think that's like a good example of a failure.
Matthew, are there any iconic boss battles that didn't make your best list that you want to discuss? Anything you kind of remember as being notable growing up playing games? Ones that's going to stick in your memory.
And these are different from our honorable mentions.
Yeah, I've got a few here that I just, I don't need to put in honorable mentions, but I thought I'd kind of mention as notable, you know?
I haven't got any No More Heroes bosses in my list.
Yeah, same.
I do really like them. I think what No More Heroes does really well, and I think it's that thing you talked about, it's that's more of a triumph of framing. The boss fights feel really important because the whole story is about working towards the boss fights.
You play through the level and then you kind of walk up a kind of corridor towards the boss room and you get a phone call through the remote on when you were playing the Wii version from Sylvia Kristel who then gives you like a hype speech and tries to kind of get you excited for the boss fight. She says, you're going to enter the Garden of Madness and all this kind of stuff. That's a perfect example, I think, where the framing and the anticipation is maybe slightly better than the actual fights.
They're still good and they've got lots of wrinkles and twists. They're good fights for turning the former on its head, but not in an unfair way. I just don't think, maybe because that game is mechanically relatively simple, it can never really take off like a Platinum game, say.
I think I agree with that. I think that has two of the three. It has framing and spectacle, I would say, No More Heroes, but not clever mechanics, I would say.
No More Heroes 3 has some bosses which are completely outside of combat. It has one which is just a game of musical chairs, which I really liked. Again, it's not very deep and it's not mechanically satisfying, but as a joke, it made me laugh and it made me excited to see what the next joke was going to be.
They kind of worked as part of the bigger piece, maybe rather than as individual boss battles.
Yeah, I thought I'd drop in Metal Gear's conceptual boss fights here, so The Pain and Psycho Mantis. Fortune, I guess, as well counts here. These are boss fights that I think are notable and worth discussing, but not necessarily good.
Or maybe good is the wrong word. They're impressive, but they're not traditional boss fights. I guess I wouldn't put any of them in my top five versus a boss fight that uses more of the game's normal mechanics.
So that's where, again, it's framing and spectacle to an extent is a big part of that. Fortune's got this big electric gun and she's shooting shit. You can't do any damage to her, but the bullets fly around her and it's quite cool to kind of watch it all play out.
Psycho Mantis, of course, the framing is amazing. There's that kind of really spooky music that plays before you meet him. He appears previously in the game.
You see him very briefly in a corridor. First time you meet Meryl and then so when he comes along later on, starts doing the memory card reading stuff, the kind of build up has been there and the kind of like, yeah, the framing is just perfect. Like he just is spooky.
He's weird. It's like perfectly done.
I don't even remember that actual fight. Like what the fight is with him. I just remember the framing of it.
He's like, this is the thing. He kind of just lobs some chairs at you, if I recall. And then you have to switch the controller over because he can read your every move and all that stuff.
But it's a lot of chair, a lot of chair lobbing if I recall correctly.
He's basically just a Yakuza hero.
And like book lobbing as well. Plus he'll, you have to keep knocking Meryl out because she will get up and then start shooting at you. So you have to kind of non-lethally put Meryl down to finish the boss.
Yeah, so it's well done. It's really clever, but wouldn't be one of my favorites, I guess. Not versus some of the others in the Metal Gear series, but I guess what I'm saying is I acknowledge they're clever and iconic without feeling the need to recognize them any further.
I also put the boss, I think Final Fantasy has some like bad end bosses or like cheap bosses. I think of Jecht in Final Fantasy X, who's powered up by these like, you meet him inside Sin, which framework is amazing in that one, because you're inside this giant time-traveling whale thing, and there's like the visage of the lost city of Xanakan that was destroyed a thousand years ago in there, and this guy who is basically tied to this mythical monster is basically waiting in there to be killed by you, his son, and it's messed up. So that as a framework is really successful.
But the boss is like this big demon-y thing with a giant sword that gets powered up by these pillar things that keep coming back to life after you destroy them. And the last time I did it, I was like, I fucking hate this boss. This is like the worst.
And so there's a few like that. Ultimecia in Final Fantasy VIII is kind of a bullshit boss. I think I only beat that because there's a glitch when I played the game, and Ultimecia for some reason wouldn't attack Zell ever.
So I just had Zell spam his melee overdrives, his limit breaks over and over again until it was dead, and it took about 45 minutes. But yeah, I think Final Fantasy has some bad ones. So yeah, I don't know.
I want to discuss those because they seem like significant bosses in games when I was growing up. Some of the bosses in Jedi Knight, the lightsaber battles, they're not in my list, but particularly in Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy, they managed to make the boss characters really good. The lightsaber jewels felt really convincing and stuff.
But yeah, those are the ones I wanted to note ahead of our top five, Matthew. But here's something I wanted to ask. Do you think boss battles still have a place in modern games more broadly?
I hope they do, for one. I think because one of the pillars of a good boss battle is spectacle, it'd be sad to let them fade away at a time where we have machines and artists and artistry capable of using those machines. It can make mad things happen.
I almost feel like there is some… It's almost like embarrassment about boss fights at certain studios. Like, certain people almost think they're above the boss fight now, that it's a bit too kind of trashy, it's a bit too much of a hangover from the kind of, you know, 80s, 90s.
It's a bit… it's a bit curby, you know? And what they're trying to do is like serious storytelling.
So that's where we get all the games that kind of end on slightly like dour, quiet notes. The fact that people don't really go mad at the end, you know? It's rarer these days, I think, that people do.
You know, from the perspective of wanting to see, like, what modern tech can do for boss fights. Like, I certainly want that. Like, you know, there are obviously exceptions.
There's enough big first party franchises which have bosses built into their DNA, like God of War or tons of Nintendo series that I think they'll still be well represented.
Yeah, I think it's, you maybe see bosses less in Western games now than you used to. But there are definitely exceptions to that. And besides, like, I think the really important factor here is that From Software have ensured that bosses aren't going anywhere.
Like, you might argue that before, in that kind of window of the late noughties, before Dark Souls, there was a period of time where they were maybe getting a lot of flak for stuff, like, you know, the Pope fight in Assassin's Creed 2, or the end boss in Bioshock, where maybe the alternative they are pivoting towards was some kind of, like, mega cluster of enemies at the end, instead of, like, and maybe, like, one story character you kill, as opposed to one boss with a giant health bar who does loads of bullshit AoE attacks. So I think they were maybe under threat for a while, but I think that FromSoft have basically ensured the bosses will never not be in games now. They're just like, because those games are so influential.
But even if you look at something like Fury, a game made by a French studio, that is a whole game of bosses, very successful game, that kind of like a mix of Icaruga and Devil May Cry sort of game. I'm sure a lot of people had that on PS Plus.
I must admit, I do like my bosses to be split up with a little bit of something.
Yeah.
The whole like this game is bosses only. I love bosses, but that doesn't particularly speak to me. I love them in the context of bigger stories and as things that you escalate towards or how they fit in the game is quite important to me.
So Fury, I must admit I haven't finished Fury, but I liked what I played enough, but at the same time I thought it's almost like a little bit one note, even though those single notes are just big awesome boss fight after awesome boss fight. Yeah. A balanced diet, I guess.
Yeah, I think it's quite novel to have a whole game that commits to that as its idea. And it sort of does the No More Heroes thing of having them all be like these slightly different personality type people and the spectacle is a big part of it because it's a very, very colorful game. It was just a really interesting take on that sort of thing.
I agree that not every game it would suit. And sometimes there are games I really love that still sabotage themselves with bosses a little bit. So I thought of Jedi Fallen Order as a game that has bosses I don't really like.
So while I think the story that is attached to some of those bosses is really good, particularly with the end boss in that game, not the end end boss, people who play the game know what we're talking about there. But the quote unquote end boss is like a really interesting, important character who is tied to your story as a character and the other characters in the game. But the lights of battles were very frustrating and very much a sense of, can I guess what animation this will be?
And it may be just being a touch too tricky for me to like always preempt what's going to happen next and like a bit of Dark Souls influence rubbing off in a game where I otherwise kind of loved the experience, but maybe the bosses didn't totally click for me. You know, did you get that experience from that one?
Yeah, I'd say I agree. I agree with that. I mean, I will say Dark Souls and From Software is like a big hole in my list.
That's because I haven't played a lot of them and I haven't got very far with a lot of them. I love the boss designs. I love the music and I love the framing of From Software bosses.
But outside of Sekiro, like mechanically, I'm not as much into it. Like they feel more like a little kind of like shapeless, I guess, because they're designed for so many different potential characters to come and fight them. They just feel like they're there doing their thing.
And I don't feel like I'm particularly in an intense one on one fight. I'm just dodging and rolling everywhere. Compared to Platinum, say, a boss in Platinum is so built around what a Platinum hero can do specifically.
And it's built to be a duel between these two very clear like movesets where I think from software stuff, they're a bit like, well, here's these bosses. And some of these fights are going to feel great because you happen to have the right kind of moveset or weapons or you've kind of the right stats for this particular thing. And some of them are going to feel rotten.
Or at least that's my experience in Elden Ring where, you know, a couple of bosses I've absolutely want and had a great time. Some of them have just ground me into dust again and again and made me feel quite bad about myself.
Yeah, it's funny because Elden Ring changes up the formula slightly in that there are bosses in that game that feel like they're tutorials more than anything. Or they're like baby bosses to get you ready for eventual bosses. That's at least the case in like Limb Grave at the start, where you've got this fairly gentle map relative to some of the areas of the rest of the game.
But even so, they'll do things like have what are clearly optional bosses dotted around the place. And it can be quite brutal as a new player to learn what is supposed to be an optional boss in a From game and what is supposed to be like a mandatory boss. And it's funny, in most games, they are like mandatory bosses because they are along the critical path, so you have to fight them in order to progress.
So it's a bit more straightforward. But in Elden Ring, a lot more ambiguous, I would say. You can just be going through a relatively easy landscape and a dragon that can fuck you up in one hit happens to be there, but everything else you can kind of deal with.
So that's interesting. Interesting to see them expand that formula a little bit. And they're not just bosses you just don't remotely understand that are optional.
I've had that in Bloodborne a few times where it's just like, I don't know, there'll just be a character I'm just nowhere near equipped for and I'm like, can't quite puzzle out in my head what the structure of the map is in the game and I don't know if they're optional or not. And yeah, it's tricky.
I think the bosses of theirs that I do like are probably gimmicky bosses, which I imagine the fans aren't as into. Have you done Evil Hogwarts yet in Elden Ring?
No, I'm still there in the old, in my old kind of hiatus on Elden Ring.
That's, I mean, without giving away, the boss of that area almost has like a sort of puzzle phase, like two phases, and the first half is almost like a sort of puzzle. You have to, you know, you're looking for a particular thing in order to kind of hurt it, and then the second half is more of a, this, now you're actually fighting this thing proper, and, you know, I quite liked the first half, because I was like, oh, okay, this is, you know, there's a very clear focus here. I have a very specific aim.
I'm not just trying to do damage, I'm trying to target this and avoid these attacks at the same time, and it was, it's very clear cut, but the read I get is that actually the From hardcore are like less into that kind of more sort of funneled experience.
Yeah, that kind of makes sense. Like, another boss that can be described that way from a From game is like the folding screen monkeys in Sekiro. So they are, I think, like three or four little monkeys in robes that hang out in this area.
They are the guardian of children who have passed the afterlife and you go around murdering them, which is brutal when I told my girlfriend that she was like not happy. That's the thing I was doing. But the whole thing with those...
Why don't you just say like they're horrible monkeys. They like pickpocketed some people or something. Or they're the monkeys that steal wing mirrors at Longleat.
Yeah, she would have really appreciated that cultural reference. Basically, one of them's got a pair of glasses as well. It's really adorable.
You're just like, I'm going to kill these on purpose in order to do some nasty shit involving some weird Japanese demon monster historical things. Anyway, those are interesting because one of them can't see you. One's got amazing sight and one's got amazing.
Hearing.
They've all got a different sense that's amplified. One, you have to trap into a dark room where it can't see you. The other one, you have to basically pull a rope and let a waterfall pour through one of the buildings and then trap it in there.
Again, it's not really about the combat side. You can't be killed in that unless you fall off a cliff too many times, which you're unlikely to do. But it's fucking hard to track down those monkeys, man.
They're really fast. So you can kind of try and biff it and cut them off when they're dashing across rooftops. But it's not a very successful approach.
And the puzzle approach really works. And I think those are good boss fights, Matthew, because they do offer a break from the more trad boss fights. That's clearly why they're there, right?
It's like a pacing thing.
I have more experience with Sekiro, but I've not got to be on the halfway point.
Malfulloreny?
Yes. Well, you know, I know this is a Patreon episode, so I've got to make sure I deliver all the hits.
Well, that's it. Plus, I'm surprised you're getting paid for those Renny now, so you've got to, like, you know, you've got to chow down.
I'll hopefully have a few more Renny funds going forward, so I can eat them more readily. They don't just have to be a rare medicinal tree. In Sekiro, there's that chap on the bridge who you basically just have to push off the bridge.
Like, I don't think you can kill him any other way. And then he sort of yells. Does he yell his name?
He's got like a funny name. Like he goes, Sir Richard or something.
Yeah, he's like some knight or something. But he's still a motherfucker. He can absolutely fuck you up, you know.
Yeah, but it's like a sort of tug of war fight, is how I remember it. You kind of hit him. And he sort of gets pushed back every time you hit him.
And you just have to like knock him into a big hole.
Yeah, it's tough break for him, really. But like, yeah, it's, yeah, that one is memorable because he does yell a load of shit. And I think he is just like meant to be a normal dude who happens to be a big, have a big sword.
So yeah, they like the odd conceptual battle. I'm sure there are more that I'm not remembering from Sekiro, but like those are the ones that kind of spring to mind. So yeah, those are kind of like some overall thoughts, Matthew.
Any more kind of like general thoughts on boss battles? Here's something I wanted to ask you, actually. QTE boss battles, are they good?
Is Crownsir, a wrestling war fort, a good boss battle?
Maybe it becomes harder with time because QTEs are so kind of commonplace and people are getting a bit sick of them. But back then, here's a game which has a few QTEs up until that point, and the idea of a boss fight built around them entirely is just... I don't know, it's quite exciting at the time.
It's hard to reset my brain, I guess. When I first played that, I was just like, oh, this is cool, I'm pulling off moves and I'm getting to see stuff normally you'd only get to see in a cutscene. It kind of still is that, but there's an illusion of you being involved, and that's kind of enough for me.
If the choice was between quicktime events and no quicktime events, but we also lost the mad scale and the mad ambition, then I'd be sad. I don't want to see a quicktime event for just punching a man in the face, but if the quicktime event is there's a Buddha the size of the moon trying to crush you in Azura's Wrath, and you're tapping A to push his thumb away from Earth or whatever, then I'm like, yeah, 100%, I'm glad this exists. Who wouldn't be?
Yeah, I think I would argue in the Resi 4's case, all the Krauser QTEs in that game are the best QTEs, and I would argue of all the things to represent in in-game gameplay, a knife fight, a knife duel is probably the hardest, so there's a logic to using QTEs.
Yeah, from a cinematic perspective, having a few more moves or interesting things to play with that you haven't fully realized as mechanics, yeah, I'm on board with that. I'd say a lot of my choices have a QTE element to them, well, some of them do anyway, yeah, I'm definitely not embarrassed about that stuff.
Well, I think it ties into what I was saying as well, it's about clever mechanics, framing or spectacle, so you can easily get the last two in there very well with a QTE boss fight. That's not a problem. While you might argue a QTE is not a clever mechanic, if it enables those other two and creates a good feeling in the player, it's arguably still worth it for sure.
People are doing interesting stuff in the space as well. There are things which basically are QTEs, but they're beyond just pressing a button, like the pistol getting pushed across the ground towards you at the end of Modern Warfare and you shooting the guy. That's basically a QTE, but it's within the mechanics of the game, but you're so limited that you can only do one thing.
Uncharted has done that a few times, Naughty Dog do that in various games, and the idea of let's just super focus in on one action for the sake of something incredibly cool, I'm down with that too.
Yeah, I think they repeat the same trick in Modern Warfare too where you pull the knife out of yourself and then throw it at that dude at the end after.
And at the time you're like, this is fucking amazing, I'm so cool. Then you realise it's played out the same way for everyone.
It's quite telling though that when it comes to 2016 and Titanfall 2, you don't have any QTEs in it, if I recall correctly. You just may be like a couple involving the robot, but I don't think there's any boss battles or anything like that. And by then it's kind of fell out of fashion, you know?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. I think it's just like a case of like maybe they had their day and people were like, well, a cut scene will suffice and we'll just make the in-game action more palatable.
But yeah, good stuff. Any more straight thoughts on boss fights, Matthew? Or should we get into our respective top fives?
Let's get into our top fives.
Cool, let's take a quick break then and we'll come back with our top fives, just like I said.
Welcome back to the podcast, The Best Boss Battle. So, me and Matthew each have a top five here of the best boss battles. We've been super selective, but I think we've got interesting things to say about each one.
I've got quite a few notes here for mine. And then there's a bunch of honorable mentions at the end. So Matthew, shall I go first here?
Yeah, kick off.
Okay, so I've picked the owl, brackets father, from Sekiro, Shadows Die Twice. Here's why I like this boss. So Sekiro has loads of bosses, so I was letting a few scrap out for this.
The true answer would probably be Genichiro Ashina, the first major sword duel in the game that truly teaches you the mechanics.
Okay, the end of the game for me.
Great boss, uses the in-game mechanics very well. Framing on top of that tower, amazing. Spectacle, because he starts lobbing fucking spells at you in the second phase of the boss fight.
Has it all, I would argue. This one I've picked because it represents, I think it's like the final challenge of the game because you need to do the steps to unlock the good ending of the game in order to even see this. So it's quite interesting, but the owl in the game is basically your character's father.
A big part of Sekiro's story at the start is like a flashback to a very key evening where some events happened and led to where you are now. When you first do this flashback sequence, the entire sequence, it turns out that your character's misremembering it and it's only through doing these steps to unlock the true ending that you remember what really happened that night and that night ended with you dueling your father in a location where you had previously fought another boss in the other timeline version of it. So you need to do these certain steps to unlock it so it could only do it in a new game plus.
And so when I encountered this boss character, who does appear as a regular boss in every play through, but this is like a secret version. It's like deadlier, faster and yeah, like a much, much greater challenge. It kind of, it seemed amazing.
And I think I really love the kind of like thematic element of like the final challenge in the game is like defeating your father completely, kind of like not holding back. And like, it's just a jewel to the death in this location you thought you knew so well. So yeah, that's kind of why I picked it, Matthew.
I think it's like, I like the idea that the true game experience technically ends halfway through the second play through because you can do this and then the game is still not finished. But one thing I also really like is when you beat him, he gives you the line, I'm defeated by my own son. The feeling is not entirely unpleasant.
And that's what he says as he disappears. And I just-
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, I just really, I really dug it. It was like the idea of like, we'll take an existing boss and make him a fuckton harder, like the ultimate challenge in the game. So you kind of understand some principles of how he works, but not all of them.
In a location you've been to before and felt like you knew really well, and it's a whole hidden part of the game you had to go out of your way to unlock. So, as optional content goes, this is up there, I think. Any thoughts on this one?
Once you've done him, do you then go off and still have to finish the rest of the game, or is it like credits roll?
No, you have to finish the rest of the game.
So you've got to go and kill those monkeys again?
Yes, I can't remember the exact order of it, because it kind of-
That sounds like a big come down after this amazing sounding ultimate boss.
I think there's even like a third version of this boss that you fight at the top of the tower at a certain point in the game. Yeah, you do have to go off, because if you want the true ending to the game, which is a very minor difference to the actual ending, I would say, in terms of actual story content, you do have to go and finish it after this, but you'll be so good at the game by this point that nothing will stop you. That's part of the reward of playing this boss.
It's like, I've done this so I can do anything. Nothing will stop me now, and that's exactly how I felt after playing this bit in Sekiro. It's like a reward for my skill in the game.
What is the fight? Is it like a Genichiro tie? Is it just like a real straight up sword on sword fight to the death?
Yeah, it is. He's like a bit more brute force. He does a bit more kind of brute force, has a few more like, has like a projectile attack you have to deal with, but like he is basically like, he sort of like kind of thumps his way towards you, and then it's just like, it's just very, very deadly.
And it's like, the setting of it is really cool. I don't know if you, did you kill, I think she called like Lady Butterfly or something?
Oh yeah, she's in that room with like the pillars.
Yeah, it's that room. So you're fighting him in that room. And like, yeah, like I say, your character, he misremembers what the events were of that evening.
So it's like you're seeing the real version and not like the, what his distorted memories are telling you. I really love that idea.
I do like the idea of like holding back some big boss treats for a replay. The kind of remixed boss, obviously thematically very, very different to Sekiro, but like that's a big Kirby trope as well. And we talked about that in the Kirby episode last week, that one of the big rewards for kind of playing the game on hard mode is playing like ultra wispy words.
This guy sounds like the ultra wispy words of Sekiro.
Yeah, another nice touch about this remixed version of that level, that flashback level, is there are characters who didn't have lines of dialogue before who do have lines of dialogue and tell you more about what's actually going on in the story at that point. So it's like a big dude you fight outside the lady butterfly thing. It was just a giant dude there.
And he talks, whereas he didn't talk the first time he played through it. And so you can overhear a conversation he's having. And I just thought, that kind of detail, just the idea that his memories have unclouded and he now remembers what actually happened is just a great notion.
And it's basically this king being betrayed by his own people and then you, the character, being left for dead. It's really, really good.
Yeah, that is great. I love that there. He remembers, and what he remembers is a really nasty boss fight.
Yeah, which he'd been doing fucking for hours out and on, on end prior to that anyway.
How the hell did he forget this amazing boss fight? If it's that cool.
Yeah, very true. Yes, that's my first one. The Owl Father in Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, an all time favorite of Big Sammy.
I've got to finish this game at some point. I've got to get past that fricking halfway boss because I was watching, I actually haven't watched anything in the game beyond that point up until recording for this episode. Like I decided to actually look at some stuff because I'd heard people talk about like a big gorilla and you kind of chop its head off and then it comes back to life.
That is so fucking eerie when that happens.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, really bad vibes. So I don't know if I'll ever get to it, but I'm kind of glad I've seen what it looks like.
Oh yeah, that gorilla is really, like do you know the tragic truth behind that gorilla? I won't spoil it if you don't know, but there is like, you go behind a waterfall I think it is, and there is like, I shouldn't spoil it for you, because it's so sad.
Is it Donkey Kong?
I will say, this is like a, I guess I have spoiled a boss there from Sekiro, but I don't think it's like that big a deal, because you probably won't know what's going on in this story anyway for anything like me, but this is a bit more easy to understand. So skip forward a little bit if you haven't played Sekiro and you want to play it after playing Elden Ring, but basically the ape had been like, there's like a single flower inside this cave where there's like a tiny bit crack of sunlight coming through and the flower is growing. This ape was like alone and kind of like screaming in this valley because it wanted to find a mate and it was growing the flower for a mate, but then the mate never came and he became infected by this terrible kind of parasite where like you cut his head off and it's been completely controlled by this like monstrous like plant thing inside it.
And it's like quite sad. It's like this ape just wanted to not be alone, but instead it's just died this awful tragic death while you've been slicing his head off.
Oh man, ain't that just the human condition?
Yeah, exactly. A nice remix to the Donkey Kong story.
He just wanted Pauline's love.
I meant to say King Kong, not Donkey Kong. Amazing. Okay, so what's your first one, Matthew?
I've grouped them together, which is the two-hander fight at the end of Legend of Zelda Wind Waker, which is Puppet Ganon and Ganondorf. I think they are sort of two phases of a boss fight because there's nothing you can really do between them. And they're tied together with a cut scene.
So in my head, you know, these games, Zelda games famously end with these Ganon encounters. What I like about this one is that you fight this giant sort of Ganon puppet, which takes on various animal forms, which kind of ticks the beast form box. And then you fight the more traditional sort of form of Ganondorf himself as a man, and you get to finish him off that way.
I was really umming and ahhing about Zelda because I feel like the bosses are really important part of the series, but individually they're quite hard to kind of take apart. So they've also sort of formulaic in that they're more like puzzle encounters than combat encounters. You know, famously in Zelda games, you do a dungeon, you get a new item in the dungeon, and then that item is the key to kind of opening up their boss's weak spot to the point that they don't really feel like sort of fights and they are impressive and they are spectacular and they're framed in a fun way in that you're working towards the boss door with the boss key and that's quite exciting.
There's a real anticipation of like what every boss is going to be in those games. But I find the actual, the puzzle element of them is what sort of holds them back for me a little bit. I was tempted to include, I think it's called Stalfos.
It's like the big boss that you fight with, the spinner disc in Twilight Princess, we basically like grind away at its spine and then spin around the room. Like it's, like got a huge scale to it. It's really exciting to look at, but mechanically not a huge amount going on to it.
So I've gone with this one, which is actually probably like a pretty straightforward fight. The puppet is like a riff on some other Wind Waker bosses in that you have to cut its strings with the boomerang, which is a bit like the plant boss in Wind Waker, and then it falls down and you have to shoot light arrows into like this giant ball on it. It's got three animal forms.
It turns from like a boar to like a spider and ends up as a kind of snake, which feels like a nice little throwback to the horrible snake boss in Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, which I swear we've talked about on this podcast before. The incredibly cursed snake whose movement is just hard enough to judge. You know, there's something kind of random about him that he's a very, very stressful customer.
Yeah, so you fight this sort of giant puppet and then you take to fighting Ganondorf. And I think it's probably one of the more successful cinematic moments in Zelda. You're in this arena which is surrounded by cascading water, because basically the sea is flooding into sunken Hyrule where the fight takes place.
So you're in this arena with all this like mad water gushing around you, which with Wind Waker's anime style, is just a really striking place for a fight. I love the actual visual Ganondorf design in this, like the anime Ganondorf with his big long kimono and his very sharp features. Just a very striking character.
The fight you have with him is just a straight up sword fight. While Zelda peppers him with light arrows from afar, so you tag team him. You don't control her at all.
The only real interaction you have is right at the end, she asks you to hold up your shield so she can bounce an arrow from the shield into him. Then it ends with this, I think, spectacularly violent moment in a Zelda game where you sort of jump and bury the sword into his head. And it's not like blood sprays out, but it's a really horrible image, very striking image of Ganondorf's frozen body with Link holding the Master Sword while it's buried in his skull.
And it's, for me, still the definitive Zelda ending, I guess, which is why I've ranked it quite high. So it's more of a spectacle and framing win than mechanical win. You must have played this, right?
I didn't finish Wind Waker, but I looked it up, knowing you're gonna discuss in this episode. I think the puppet Ganon element has a real cool spectacle to it as well. That's a cool looking thing that kind of matches the art style quite well of this game and conceptually.
But I do really like the Ganon design and animation is really well done. Yeah, it seems really cool. I like the idea of using the water because that obviously being a kind of like key mechanic in the game as well and like kind of underlining the sense that this is like a Hyrule setting that is flooded like you say.
Yeah, it looks cool. And I think I'm with you on Zelda bosses generally as well. Like, I can't say that any of the bosses in Breath of the Wild, those whatever they're called, the four different beast things, they're not particularly-
Yeah, sort of the Blight, kind of Ganons or whatever they are.
Yeah, like they're kind of like more kind of like boss type elements of those isn't particularly interesting. The more interesting counters in that are like regular enemies who are just really fucking hard to kill. And just like how you can kind of deal with those using some of the different systems in the game.
That's more interesting. So yeah, I think I'm with you on that. But yeah, no, it looks super cool.
Yeah, I should finish this game so I can see it in action.
Yeah, well, maybe one day they'll make a absolutely gorgeous 60 frames a second HD version of it. I still think that's something I would like to see is just a super smooth version of all this animation. Even the Wii U HD remake is sort of held back in that regard.
I feel like there's an extra layer of glory to be unlocked in Wind Waker and all of these things will only become more spectacular. Also a shout out to, he's like the sand worm boss in Wind Waker because it's got this absolutely amazing theme tune. The boss itself, I think, is only fine.
You're sort of hookshotting its tonsils to give him a good old whack, but it plays this really jaunty tune that just gets you in a good murdering mood. I like it.
Mulgara, is that the boss?
Mulgara, yeah, that's the one.
Good choice, Matthew. I do really love that design of him, actually. And also stumbled across a really funny headline while looking in Google Image, which is why Ganondorf was wrong in the Wind Waker.
And I love the idea of writing an op-ed that questions whether Ganondorf was ever right. That's amazing.
Oh my god.
Very delighted by that. Do you like any of the other Ganondorf encounters in the different Zelda games, Matthew? Do they speak to you at all or is this the only one you really like?
Batting, lightning back and forth is super iconic. That's a very memorable Zelda moment of playing lightning tennis with him in Ocarina. Ocarina, the actual end fight where he's the monster and you're just rolling around him to smack his tail is incredibly underwhelming.
I actually think the end boss fight, the very end phase of Breath of the Wild ain't too hot either. Because there you're like, oh, this is going to be amazing. He's out on Hyrule Field, it's this giant beast, but you're actually just riding quite a slow horse around it, shooting those huge targets.
And it doesn't really land as a colossal boss fight. That's been done way better in many other games. It's important that there are places that Breath of the Wild 2 can improve.
Because you've already got one of the greatest games of all time, and the idea of Breath of the Wild with a really compelling suite of bosses, now that's beyond a 10 out of 10.
Yeah, of course, because you don't have the dungeons in the same way, so you are a bit boss deprived in that game.
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, good stuff, Matthew. Time to get a really obvious one off the board. Someone had to do it, so I've taken up the challenge.
The End in Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater. Very famous.
Classic.
Yeah, very famous boss fight. I will say, actually, Matthew, the Ganondorf one did appear on a bunch of the list of the best boss battles I saw, so there must be some consensus about that one among Zelda fans. Yep, so The End is this elderly sniper member of the Cobra Unit in Metal Gear Solid 3 who are like the boss's former kind of like comrades who she rejoins at the start of the game.
As Snake, you are on this kind of like almost apocalypse now-ish journey through a jungle, taking them out one by one on your way to your inevitable clash with the boss. This one is such a memorable fight for a few reasons. It's a sniper fight in a giant jungle area.
It's actually like three different areas of the map. One area's got like a kind of like a river running through it. One's just like a jungle bit.
There's a small base in one of them. And you are trying to track down this sniper who is very well camouflaged in among the environment. And the first time I played it, it took me hours to do.
Now when I play it, I can do it in about five minutes. No problem at all. You are tracking him using a microphone.
And so this boss, I would say, has everything. It has clever mechanics. The microphone is a really clever mechanic.
It's something that's already part of the game, but here you're required to use it beyond just like listing out for Easter eggs, which is traditionally how you use a microphone in Metal Gear games. So you're trying to like basically get information using it. The framing is amazing because you're in this quite eerie jungle setting.
There's no music playing. And then in terms of spectacle as well, he can basically hold you up and you can be put in prison in the middle of the boss fight, have to break out and go back and finish the boss fight, which is an amazing notion, I think. And the first time that happened, that blew me away because he darts you, he kind of sleep darts you and you see your vision fading.
You're like, oh fuck. But then like, as you kind of like fiddle around with your inventory, then come out the inventory, he's snuck up behind you and he's got a gun against your head. And then suddenly you wake up in prison, which is really, really cool.
Boss prison.
Yeah, so this boss fight arguably has everything. I knew someone who worked on Games TM, I won't say their name, it's not Ashley Day, who messed with their PS2 clock in order to kill this boss, because you can do that. He's a really old man, so you can kill him with time if you want to.
An amazing notion. Before I go any further, Matthew, why don't you weigh in on the end as well, because I imagine you've got strong feelings about it too.
Look, I'd read a lot about the game going in. So, this is a boss, I mean, like a lot of Kojima bosses. I actually wish I'd been able to discover some of this for myself, because when you know about some of the gimmicks in it, whatever, it maybe loses a little bit of magic.
I have very similar memories of it to you in terms of how long it took, and I was like, am I doing this right? Have I broken it? Like, there's a lot of the game, a lot of this fight, you can sort of run around without encountering him at all, to the point where you're like, is there a boss?
What's even going on here? And so, yeah, like the idea of having to completely change up your style, make use of that extra gadget to kind of get your head around it. I mean, it's a classic Kojima move.
I think this was the one I talked about when they asked me to appear on the Metal Gear documentary. So this is why I'm on IMDb.
He's always getting on about that, isn't he? I mean, geez, go for it, man.
Well, it's, you know, it's helped me and Guillermo del Toro.
Who knows, maybe there'll one day be a true crime documentary about this podcast that ends with us being incarcerated by, from all of our Yushinaka slander. So it could happen. Yeah, do you know what I will say actually about this one?
Is that I actually didn't do any reading on Metal Gear Solid 3 before I played it. So the end was a complete surprise to me. It was like a period where I stopped reading about games and paying attention to games.
And so when I came back, the two games I picked up were Resi 4 and Metal Gear Solid 3. I didn't know anything about either of them. So it was a complete surprise.
Yeah, complete surprise coming to this and meeting this boss. And it slowly unraveling how exciting that was, you know, good times. Yeah, so really good.
Very, very preposterous that when you use the microphone on him, he sat there saying, this is the end to himself. And sometimes he'll fall asleep during the fight, which is funny as well. I think as well, actually, here's a really important thing.
I think this boss is tons easier in the HD collection than he is in the fucking blurry PS2 original.
Oh, well, because he just stands out more.
Yeah, he does. You can see different shades of green more, because he got more pixels on the screen showing you where he is.
You should just have it on PC go into the options and turn vegetation off. Just pull the slider down and watch his fars get revealed.
Remove the character model details, so he just looks like a PS1 series of polygons. It's like, there's the motherfucker.
Isn't there something with his bird as well?
Yeah, I can't remember what his bird does, but the bird sort of squawks every now and then, I think, in his own shoulder.
Isn't it like if you kill his bird? Like, it's harder for him to see you or something? There's so many variables to this.
There is the one thing I've missed out here. Well, when you come to the dock before the boss fight, he's on the dock, and if you hit him with your sniper rifle there and kill him, you never do this boss battle.
Oh, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, that's like a classic Kojima touch, isn't it?
How do you think the quiet sniper fight holds up in Metal Gear 5?
Well, I did like the fight, the truth is, though, I think this works better because it's got those additional extra elements to it, like the jungle setting, the fact that he is hidden and the fact that you can wake up in the prison and that there are multiple environments to follow him through. It's a way more successful fight than Sniper Wolf, for example, which I think is just like, where the fuck is she in the snow? Okay, there she is, shoot her.
Whereas this is a version of that, but much more sophisticated. I think those additional mechanics really make it. The quiet boss fight, what is the mechanic in that one there is?
Can't you knock her out by calling your horse in to land on her or some bullshit?
Yeah, you can do aerial drops on where she's hiding, and then the crate falls on her and knocks her out. I mean, of course, you get, once you've fought her, she comes and lives on your oil rig and does some slightly dubious shower scenes and stuff, which is not something that happens with the end.
Yeah, for shame, I say.
For shame. I want to see an old guy having a bath on my oil rig.
I think people, I did see people swapping in different character models in that scene. That would be quite a funny one to do there. Preposterous dancing in the water one with Snake while the quiet theme plays.
That's so silly. Yeah, that is the other thing. It's like, can I be seen to be like endorsing the whole quiet thing?
Probably not. Quiet's character design is preposterous, even by Kazuma standards.
I do like how the quiet fight, because that world is one big open world rather than contained arenas, I like the size of it and also the fact that it kind of comes out of nowhere. If I remember correctly, in V, you're just sort of riding from point A to point B on the map and then all of a sudden, you're kind of pulled into this sniper fight and you're like, there's sniper fire from somewhere and you're like, oh shit, it's all kicking off. They just couldn't do that with what they had at the time on when they were making Metal Gear Solid 3, even though the fight itself is way better.
So maybe it's for nothing.
No, no, I think it was the only good boss fight in Metal Gear Solid 5.
Yeah, well, that stupid fiery bloke, that was rubbish.
Oh yeah, the guy who is Volgin from MGS3, but on fire, or Sally Anthropos, which looked amazing. That had spectacle, but was otherwise quite a rote boss fight with a big robot. So yeah, that's definitely up there.
I like that boss fight, but the end is the ultimate sniper boss fight, I think.
The greatest concept and execution of, I'd say, any Kojima boss fight as well. And there's a lot of good contenders for it, but this is the one, I think.
This was the reason to set a Metal Gear game in the jungle, for sure. Yeah, good stuff. What's your second pick, Matthew?
Again, a bit like Zelda, it's more of a sort of representative pick. I don't really know where these fights fit into the grand tapestry of boss fights, but I've picked, I think it's pronounced, Knuckle-a-Tech from Super Mario Odyssey, which is one of the many bosses that you fight in the Sand Kingdom. It's like a big kind of sort of Aztec head with two stone fists with this delightful mechanic where you're trying to dodge its hands and when he sort of slaps you and you dodge, and then his hand is sort of dizzied by the impact, and then you use Mario's cap to possess his hand.
So you then control his giant stone fist and you just have to drive it into his face. And it like punches this giant Aztec in the face and he goes flying. You do that three times and it's over.
Now, the problem with not this boss fight, but like Odyssey's boss fight, and I'd also group the Galaxy games in this, is they are brilliant concepts, beautifully executed, but due to the kind of, slightly kind of contained nature of them, they never go completely off the rails. You know, they're very like three hits and done. So like you never really get your teeth into any of them.
But I wanted to put them on the list, just because I think EAD Tokyo, who make Galaxy One, Galaxy Two, Odyssey, have got a brilliant, brilliant eye for a boss fight. I think they're really good at taking the mechanic you've been playing with in the level up to the boss, and then, you know, really making that the capper for the level, you know?
Yeah.
They do this loads of times in Galaxy, you know, you'll be on a level where there's lots of bullet bills, and then it will end in Mega Leg, which is the sort of mech where you climb up its legs and you're meant to sort of shepherd the bullet bills into crashing into it to kill it, and things like that. You know, there's this now quite cliched thought about Marriott Galaxy. It comes from an Iwata-Rasi interview where they talk about this, where they say they build levels, this like three act structure, where they kind of introduce an idea in the first act of the level, then they expand on it in the second, and then the third is really the test of like everything you know about that mechanic.
And it's why so many of the Galaxy levels have this like beautiful kind of power curve where you start off and then by the end, they end in like a sort of fireworks display almost. And in a lot of those levels, that third act is a boss. And so they make loads of bosses in Galaxy One, Two and Odyssey, which I really like.
They're all different. They're all perfectly built around one or two ideas from that level. There's just a huge amount of variety in them.
I guess they very rarely make boss lists because by design they're quite simple and they're not there to completely throw you off. There's a little bit of threat, but the difficulty on these games isn't really the focus, which is why I'm deniered about including them. I went for this guy just because I think the tactile smack of his fist into his face is so nice.
And it's such a big power fantasy where you're suddenly in control of this huge fist. It's like at that point in the game, it's one of the bigger things you've controlled. The idea of possessing a bit of the boss to use against it.
Beautiful simplicity to that idea. I could have picked many other bosses. Also, there's one I really like, which is a mech that's sort of like a, it's almost like a Japanese pagoda, but come alive as a mech.
And you have to knock it over, and then you possess those birds with the long beaks who stick their beaks in and then bounce up on their beaks. You have to peck up the side of this wooden mech to kind of smash its weak points. Just little things like that.
A really sort of cinematic, exciting exploration of an established idea. This team does that brilliantly.
Yeah, so I must admit, I would struggle to put any Mario boss I've played against into one of these beyond the simple like, you know, like the spectacle is definitely something that the 3D, all the 3D games have got in terms of bosses, but I don't know if I would ever like truly impressed by the mechanical side of them, but it sounds like this has a reason to be impressed, you know?
Maybe it's more like chin-strokey, appreciate the kind of craft and art of it, but I like that these games have tons of bosses. Most of them are very unique. They are bosses as varied and wild as Galaxy and Odyssey are varied and wild, which is reason to be excited.
I toyed with using, there's one called Boulder Geist as the example from Galaxy, which is like the kind of ghost where you swing these bombs around, these sort of bombos. You sort of grab their tongues, swing them around and then smash these bombs into like a ghost encased in rocks and you have to break his outer shell. That's also just really tactile and nice.
The thing that Mario Team, because they're so good at like the feeling of games and like the physical sensation of playing something and the texture of the games, the sensation of smashing a boss and finally decking a boss is really, really well done. It's just the fights maybe never get as exciting as they need to properly like register, but I'm doing it anyway. It's my list, god damn it.
Yeah, of course. Yeah, nothing. Let nothing stop you.
Don't worry. I've got one bullshit entry in here that will...
That wasn't a bullshit entry.
Well, no, no, not saying that. I'm just saying that, you know, just to make you feel better if you're slightly unsure of yourself, it's all good.
No, I did um and ah about it. I know what the patrons want to hear. They want to hear some Nintendo.
Exactly. They don't want to hear about Destiny 2, which is where my next boss comes from. So I wanted to put one Destiny boss in here because I think these are kind of like a feat of boss design unto themselves.
I mean, I guess they're most similar to MMO raid design where you would have like a giant party of people all doing like their own class as different thing in order to like help beat the boss. And, you know, I understand there's some very clever variants on that, but obviously this is a first person shooter version of that, which is quite interesting. So Destiny 2's raids, for those who don't know, requires six human players, there's no matchmaking.
You need to go actually find the people in the real world to go play with you, which is, has always held up with the people I used to play with Destiny with, because it's really hard to get six people over 30 to commit their time to play a game.
That's the real boss fight, am I right?
Yeah, exactly. This is an interesting one. This is Callus from Destiny 2's Leviathan raid.
And you can no longer play this in the game because it's been vaulted. So this is like a lost boss. You cannot just log on to Destiny 2 and play this.
But it was a real favorite of mine, of all the different raids we did. And we did a few of them multiple times. This is the one I liked the most, because he's like this giant robot man with flesh underneath him in this garish gold robot man, in this garish gold spaceship, who is surrounded by the mythical space wine grapes and his drinking wine from these grapes.
And it's quite retunned. And it's kind of preposterous over the topic. I've heard him compare to Hedonism Bot from Futurama, which I think is a good comparison because he is a bit preposterous.
And to start the fight, you need to literally shoot a sort of glass of wine out of his hand and then the fight kicks off. And the thing about the Destiny raids is that they are like a kind of masterclass of precision and synchronization between groups of players, like doing things at the right time. In each phase of the boss, half of your squad stays in the initial room with Kalas, which has all these grapes around you and it has these like, these like in front of Kalas, it's like a series of plates that correspond to symbols.
And you're not quite sure of what they mean straight away, but you just have to fend off enemies in that room if you're one half of the team. But another half of the team randomly gets teleported into a parallel dimension where this like giant kind of like purple visage of the boss's giant head appears in front of you and is sucking you towards him. And each player, when looking at his head, can see a different symbol.
They read those out to the players who are still in the main room with the boss. And then basically in that room, the one symbol that's not called out, the plates in that room, like an enemy will appear above each of those plates and you have to kill the one enemy, not the others, that didn't appear on Kalas' head in the parallel dimension. That sounds preposterous, but once you get it, everyone's like, I've got Cup or whatever, and then everyone's like, okay, well, it's not Cup, and then the three are read out, and then it's like, okay, we know which one to kill.
And once you've done that, you can damage him. And you basically have to stand on the different plates in the game one by one until Kalas does this Iron Man style beam attack, and you've got to jump off and go to the next plate. You're just absolutely spamming with everything you've got.
And then the cycle begins again. You can do it in two or three of those goes, but maybe it's hard to explain why a Destiny raid is exhilarating, but the unpredictable nature of not knowing whether you're going to get sucked to that other dimension or not, and also just the tension of having to read out the right symbol and not say something ambiguous to correspond to that symbol.
What is the most interesting stuff in that game locked away? Well, A, behind a six-player co-op and B, permanently locked behind the vault or whatever that is.
Yeah, that's it. There's a lot of players who love Destiny who will never see this because they'll never find the five people to play it.
Well, my experience with Destiny is just slightly generic robots being a bit sad about a big ball in the sky, and you're like, ugh, and then you tell me this, that there's a mad culinary robot who you have to work out its secret feeding habits. Like, what the fuck?
On this giant gold spaceship, gold interiors, gold exterior, it's amazing. And here's the other great thing, right? Once you destroy him, you realize he's a robot at the end.
He's not actually a beast at all. He's like a robot inside, and he kind of blows up. And then you go into this secret room to collect your awards, and in that room, there's a production line of him again, over and over and over again.
And I don't know what the lore reason behind that is, but I like the idea that it's almost like the game winking at you, like, yeah, someone else is going to have to play against this guy in five minutes, so there's going to be another Callus, exactly the same as this one, off the production line in the game. I'm sure that wasn't the intent. I'm sure there's a lore egg somewhere that explains what is actually going on.
But I just like, oh, you thought you killed Callus, did you? Well, there's like a hundred of them behind this door, and I really like that. So I hope I was able to explain in some way why this is such a good boss fight, Matthew.
I'd love to see that.
It's the touch of shooting the glass out of his hand. They're kind of like, he's appalled, and then the fight starts. It's so good.
I would be appalled too. And what you've described is basically how six people would have to kill me.
Yeah, while you're slowly drinking, I don't know, would you diet coke for you?
Pepsi Max.
Yeah, there you go. Okay, very good. Well, there you go.
It was nice to talk a bit of Destiny, and I hope the listeners at home weren't too bored by that explanation.
Oh, that sounds great.
Yeah, it's really good. You can watch it on YouTube if you want to see what the deal is. Yeah, very, very good boss fight.
So what's your next, your third one, Matthew?
I've gone for the Masked Lumen Sage in Bayonetta 2. It's a character you fight several times in this game in various forms. I'm picking the one that you fight, the first time I think you fight him, in Chapter 4, the games are quite early on.
This is obviously Platinum amazing boss fights. They may appear a second time in my list. We shall see.
I don't know why I'm trying to build anticipation.
I mean, they'll find out in about 10 minutes, so yeah.
I know. Yeah, that was bad. They're obviously like a huge range of bosses that Platinum do, but like, you know, I'd say a lot of them you could kind of group into.
You fight a kind of galactic-scaled thing in more of a kind of a puzzle kind of encounter where it's about like dodging attacks, then you get a weak spot and you pummel it for a bit and then you dodge attacks and you pummel the weak spot. And then you have a kind of you fighting something more your size in a straight one-on-one fight. And this is something cameos like always done.
You know, this is in Bayonetta 1. You know, it's John who's like the rival witch who basically has your powers in the Devil May Cry series. Virgil, another human sized enemy that you encounter.
They're less spectacular, but they're super, super pure because it's basically what if you fought something with the same powers as you. And it's about having the might of your move set kind of thrown in your face, which the kind of Mars Sage fits into. But why I like this particular fight is it has that incredible precision of that smaller fight, but it also escalates wildly in that about a third into the fight, you both summon these sort of, you know, he summons like a giant angelic attacker, you summon a giant demonic attacker, and they start having like the wildest fight in the background.
So then you're trying to concentrate on this very exacting kind of fight in the foreground. Why this just chaos of this giant angel fighting this giant demon? And there is some impact on it.
So every once in a while, the angels start like revving up an attack that's going to come into the foreground and hurt you. So that's when you really need to like pummel the sage to break his concentration so that your demon can then sort of lead the way. I'm not going to say it's any, you know, you're not controlling them at this point in the background, but there is some connection between sort of how the fight is progressing in the foreground to what's happening in the background.
It's almost so busy that you couldn't possibly pass this fight on your first or second attempt. I think it's almost something like designed for you to replay again and again, just to get a deeper appreciation of like just how manic and detailed everything is. You know, like the first time you're just scrapping to try and survive against this character who can throw a lot of your moves back at you, you know, basically just spamming as much witch time as possible to land any hits.
But like the second or third time, you begin to appreciate like the narrative of the fight that's going on in the background and then it all builds to this brilliant head where you finally control your giant demonic summon to pummel the face of his giant angelic summon. So it's like a rare fight in that game that I think goes from the human scale to the kind of godlike scale in one fight. So it's kind of a best of both worlds.
I must admit, there's a real close second if we're talking Bayonetta, which is obviously the classic end to the first game where you fight Jubileus, which is like a colossal beast where you're smashing all these masks in, but then you fight creation in space and end up basically punching a god through the solar system so they burn up in the sun.
Yeah.
Like one of the most spectacular endings to a game ever. This is next level. It's that thing I was talking about earlier.
I want to see what people do with the new generation of power, with that old kind of thinking. That's exactly what Platinum did. They were like, our command of 3D space and camera and character models.
Look what we can make happen. And it's kind of astonishing. But this one, I think, has the technical fight as well as that spectacle.
So it's, yeah, I think it's pretty special.
Yeah. It's interesting you pick a boss from Bayonetta 2 and not the original, which I consider an inferior game Bayonetta 2. Like, yeah.
What was the kind of logic for that? Is this just one that kind of sticks out in the memory more?
The problem with Bayonetta 2, I wouldn't say it's like the individual boss fights, but like the structure of the game. Like, it has less, like, level between bosses. There's stretches of this where it just feels like a boss rush mode.
The city isn't as fun to explore. Like, there's less kind of smaller fights. It's a bit more like arena, arena, arena.
So it has, it feels like less of a ride than the original Bayonetta does. I think that Bayonetta 1 is the better game for sure. But there are a few bosses where Bayonetta 2 just really, really, really lands it.
And it's so vibrant as well. Like, I love the colour scheme of Bayonetta. It's just like really rich kind of blues and purples.
To my eyes, I prefer like the colour scheme of Bayonetta 2. It's also got this, I guess it does count as a boss. You fight this knight with a sword underwater.
It's got this great thing where, obviously, you've got witch time Bayonetta, which is when you dodge at last second, you get like two seconds of slow-mo to kind of like pummel an enemy with. And this enemy is swiping a sword at you underwater. But when you go into witch time, obviously time slows, and you realize that when he moves his sword, he's moving it like so fast that the water's like parting, like the, you know, parting the Red Sea or whatever.
It sort of reveals this like hidden graphical effect that you can only see in slow motion, which is the fact that he's doing such devastating slices that this entire ocean is parting around him. That's so fucking cool. Like as a visual effect, I love that so much, but the fight's only okay.
Yeah, I think it's, I think a lot of that game's problems don't come down to the bosses. The structure is one thing, but also it was the way the weapons fit together just didn't feel quite as right to me as the original for whatever reason. Couldn't quite figure that out, but yeah, I wasn't as big a fan of two as one, but I do remember these looming enemies for sure.
So not a bad call, Matthew.
This one's obviously harder to play because, you know, it's still a Nintendo exclusive, but I've got the Switch version of it and it's really, really nice. If you can play it on an OLED, oh boy, this looks good on that handheld screen.
Oh, nice, yeah. Yeah, I should probably pick these up on Switch at some point so I don't have to keep plugging the Wii U in. Though we have launched a Patreon now, so I can literally make plugging the Wii U in a stretch goal.
That could be a big...
Big Sammy's, big OLED fun.
If we hit a grand, I'll get the Wii U out and play Xenoblade Chronicles X. Okay, good stuff.
For one half hour stream.
Good to have a platinum ticked off in this list. Good stuff. So my fourth pick.
This is a pure spectacle and framing pick. This is Ultima Weapon from Final Fantasy VIII. Now, in the game, there is this area called the Deep Sea Research Facility.
Early on, before you get an airship in the game, you get the garden, your base at the start of the game becomes mobile and you get to use that as a little hovercraft basically. And so you can go around most of the world, but you can't go onto all surfaces and you can't get everywhere. So I remember pottering around in this floating base just on the world map, going across this vast ocean, nothing in the ocean at all.
Oh wait, there is one tiny little wrecked-looking building in the middle of the ocean. I wonder what that's about. Return later on with Final Fantasy VIII's gorgeous-looking spaceship airship, the Ragnarok, and you can actually land on top of this tiny structure in the middle of the ocean.
You don't really know what it is. And then you go inside. The whole place is abandoned.
There are no humans there. Something has clearly happened there. And you descend and you descend and you descend.
You unlock these different levels and keep going down and down and down and down. You get to what you think is the bottom, and waiting for you there is Bahamut, the iconic Final Fantasy summon. You fight Bahamut, and then once you've beaten him, you can summon him and battle anytime you like.
So you think, okay, cool. Well, that was cool. I guess that was the end of the thing.
Nope. You go further down to what feels like just like real, it's like a subterranean sort of cave location. There's like a little kind of like lake there, this running water, and there's this giant metal cable, and Squall, the main character, fiddles with this like little sequence of buttons, and the cable just starts moving, and like it goes for ages, and then you see like the kind of floors above you, and alarm starts going off.
You think, what the fuck is this? And then it's like a horror setting, and then like the thick cable keeps moving and dragging something up, and then suddenly the battle just starts, and there's this like giant monster in front of you, and I love this because the horror framing just added something to what is otherwise a fairly straightforward like optional boss. You just kind of like basically just have to batter in with Squall's limit break a few times, but I just really love the idea, it's a step-by-step reveal of what is this horror underground that led to all these people not being in this facility anymore, and that it was this setting that was teased out to you over the course of the game if you were curious as a player.
So I loved all that, Matthew. Any thoughts on that?
And so is this like a big optional boss then?
Yeah, so there's like two big optional bosses in the game. There's like a mega weapon and Ultima weapon. A mega weapon is borderline impossible.
That's in the last disc of the game. Ultima weapon is out there in the open world for you to find in this location basically. So yeah, I didn't know what I was getting into when I first went there, but I just really, it's like, it's the cable moving thing and the alarm going off and the kind of weird dark damp setting where you're not sure what the fuck went on here that led to like no one being here.
Just a bit different for Final Fantasy, like a dungeon of sorts, but like, yeah, quite an interesting sort of riff on one. Another nice Easter egg. This character Ultima weapon is holding the Ultima weapon that Cloud uses in Final Fantasy VII, which asks some questions about how this game might connect to that game.
Just a nice little Easter egg there. So, yeah, Final Fantasy...
I've just seen some lazy asset reuse.
Oh, wait, take the fud out of it, Matthew, geez.
Oh, sorry.
No, no, that's fine. So yeah, Final Fantasy wanted to give a kind of shout out there because they do some good bosses, but that's the one that sticks in the memory out of that game.
I know we were talking a little bit about Final Fantasy X earlier, but I've never played enough of a JRPG to ever get into the deep, hard, optional end game content of any of them. When I saw this one on your list, I was wondering about the mindset of people who go after that stuff in JRPGs. In other Final Fantasies, is there any one where you have done the crazy borderline impossible thing?
Yeah, so I have done them. I wouldn't say necessarily I've done them legit. You might remember, Matthew, I'm sure you would have encountered these, the Dark Aeons in Final Fantasy X.
They're actually my honorable mentions for the end of the episode, but basically, the summons in the game. I think after you kill Seymour in the game and then the Temple of Yevon comes after you, these demonic versions of all your summons are unleashed in the world, and they are just waiting for you in these different locations, and they're color-flipped, so they look quite fucked up. And you could go back to a temple in Bersede and get a really nasty surprise when this boss insta-kills you with five nines of damage.
So yeah, I did beat those by using Yejimbo, the summon that you pay, to cut enemies in half, and I basically just spent a fortune getting him to kill all of these one by one, and that's how I did it. I beat all of the Dark Aeons by cheating with Yejimbo, but it beats trying to... It would have taken hundreds of hours, otherwise I could be bothered.
Because when I look at those things, I think, is that what this actually is? Is it just a case of you have to grind the numbers up so high that you eventually win? There's not like a...
Well, there's a skill to it, I guess, but it's just a raw numbers game.
Yeah, some are more interesting than others, and some use mechanics differently. So with Final Fantasy VII, because that's got the summon Knights of the Round, and you can basically, I think, set that to cast over and over again in a row, and because that is like a multi-attack summon where loads of fucking King Arthur Knights or whatever just come and batter the enemy for you, you can take on some of those optional bosses and just have that, so it's like the spell repeating over and over and over again, and that's one way you can do it. But generally speaking, yeah, they are about like, well, it's not like you'll finish the end boss and be able to do them.
You'll finish the end boss and play for another 200 hours, and you might be able to do them, you know? So, yeah, this one's a lot softer, though.
I did that giant turtle in Final Fantasy XV.
Oh, yeah.
Is it Adamantoys?
Adamantoys, yeah.
With, you've got like that insta-kill ring move.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Because I read about it online, if you could like eat loads of food to kind of boost like particular stat, I don't know, like your luck stat or something. So I basically ate like 10 roast dinners or something in a row. And then you save the game and it's got like a very low probability of insta-killing that turtle boss, who for people who haven't seen it, it's like a turtle the size of a mountain.
It's absolutely massive. Didn't they say it was a boss fight that took like 24 hours or something in the lead up to it? I think that was bullshit, but there was definitely some like big talk.
I mean, it felt like it.
We've got this boss that you're going to have to play for hours and hours at least. But yeah, I just kept spamming this one ring attack until eventually it just like instant killed it in one and just sort of evaporated it. Oh, that was good.
I think I actually did it for a video on the Xbox YouTube channel. So I think you can see the footage of me melting the turtle in an old Xbox UK YouTube vid.
Well, the funny thing about that is I think that that is a boss, an end game boss that exposes the flaws in that combat system, which is basically just a game of spamming very nice-looking moves. And I did that boss legit, and it took me about 25 minutes of solid play to beat it, of doing the same thing over and over again, and it was just a noctis just battering his head and avoiding his attacks, the attacks he does, mostly due to pressing the square button for hours, well, for what felt like hours, basically. They added another optional end boss.
They added a mega weapon to the Royal Edition, because they added the whole city at the end of the game, whereas before you could only go to that one little bit for the boss. There was a whole cityscape you could walk across, basically go underground and stuff. Appearing out of a portal is this giant spider robot thing that's a mega weapon, and that's an end game boss they added.
So they still like doing them, the old FF games.
Well, I better go and get my ten roast dinners down me and start spamming the magic ring.
That's what you always do before you fight your enemies, isn't it, Matthew, eat ten roast dinners?
Yeah, I was eating ten roast dinners before I even fought a single goblin in that game. All his mates are like, Prince, you don't have to do this.
It's like when I would make the recipe that was just some beef floating in a pot noodle, and I was there thinking, that is not nutritious enough to go and fight a god afterwards, which is basically what you're doing. Yeah, that came to mind.
Pot noodle breath, brilliant.
What's your fourth pick, Matthew?
My fourth pick is quite an old school one. I've actually gone for Gunstar Heroes on the Mega Drive, and I've gone for Seven Force. Are you familiar with this boss?
I'm not, but I'm quite surprised to hear you pick a treasure game boss, but intrigued, all the same.
Treasure, they're sort of a proto-platinum, in that Treasure were originally a bunch of Konami guys who worked on various things. I think a lot of them were on Contra games, and then they left, like ten of them left in the early 90s, set up a little studio and made Gunstar Heroes for the Mega Drive, and begin this sort of relationship of making really characterful, hardcore action games. Like, that is the Platinum story as well, except for Capcom twenty years later.
And yeah, Gunstar Heroes, I mean, it'd be a bit unfair to say it's just a boss rush mode, but the thing that people remember in most treasure games are the bosses, and you know, there's plenty of fun kind of like run and gunnery in between those bosses, but I think this is what we're really here for. This was slightly inspired by playing Sentinel Punishment on the N64 on Switch Online this year. I played it a couple of months ago.
I was just reminded of like, this just feels so good. This is such a class act, and the boss fights are absolutely amazing, and it just got me thinking about some of their games, which I'd played on the past on like, the Virtual Console and different things like that. This is like, it was more like I wanted to have an Auditor Treasurer in my list, and I think 7-4, even though it's a Mega Drive boss, and they've made more technically impressive things, it's a real standout achievement in that it's a, it's like a mech that chases you through a mineshaft.
You're in a minecart that is scrolling, so you really only just control like, jumping the minecart up and down and shooting, like it really limits your movement. The big thing with the mech is that it has seven different forms, which it switches between. You have to play the game on hard to play all seven forms, like on medium it only has five, on easy I think it has three.
It always starts with soldier force, which is like this running kind of, running guy who sort of throws these sort of thrusting punches at you, but after that it will randomise, like what the forms are. So if you play on easy, medium, like the boss fight is different every time, you never know what you're going to get. And it's this huge technical feat, because it's this transforming character made out of blocks.
A programmer who also designed the boss, sort of made it single-handedly, kind of came up with this approach that took a lot of simple parts, like cubes, and then had them animating together rather than having one giant sprite that would be very labour and power intensive. It has a lot of small basic parts, but with just very complicated maths holding them together, and that's how he makes this quite astonishing moving thing on the Mega Drive happen. The way it shifts into these different forms, like different animal forms, is still to this day very, very impressive.
Very, very cool. And it's like seven boss fights in one, which I really like. It has this cool run-up to it where it says seven force on screen, and then it starts listing the forms.
Obviously, if you've not played it before and you don't know what's coming, it's just this list of seven bosses and their moves. Soldier Force, Tails Force, Tiger Force, and you're like, what the hell is this? What's happening?
And then it starts listing all their moves, and they've got weird names like Dance Dance and Golf Bullet, and there's one called Russian Roulette, and you're just like, what does all this mean? And then it just chucks all this mad, cuboid, shifting thing at you. For the Mega Drive, this is kind of amazing.
I think we'd still be pretty impressed if this was just done in modern pixel art, it would be awesome.
That's cool. Is this a game you played at the time, Matthew, or just recently discovered?
I remember seeing pictures of it and reading about it in games magazines, and just thinking, what the hell is this thing? This looks crazy. Maybe a friend had it, but yeah, no.
I played this properly on Virtual Console when I got into it. It definitely holds up. Just lots of weird visual effects.
Like I say, it has that platinum thing of how the hell are they doing this? They've really got amazing tech and art command to pull this off. It's a really beloved boss.
There's a lot of affection for this. I know that Chris Donlon at Eurogamer is also a big Seven Force stan. This will often come up in his pieces.
An older boss that I think still holds up today is still every bit as magic as it was back then.
That's really cool. Were you much a fan of the Treasure GBA output, Matthew? Astro Boy, Omega Factor and Gunstar Super Heroes.
I haven't played a lot of them, I must admit.
I think you'd really like Astro Boy as a living museum of that manga. That's a rad game. I think you'd really like that.
I need to fill some holes there for sure. When will Nintendo give us Game Boy Advance Switch Online?
That Astro Boy game is so good, but I can't ever see it being re-released anywhere. That was a proper 9 out of 10 shooter. That was one day to be picked in a GBA draft, no doubt.
My last pick, Matthew, is Phalanx from Shadow of the Colossus, best known as the Sand Worm Colossus in that game. Obviously, Shadow of the Colossus is a series of boss battles, a mixture of action, platforming and puzzle solving to defeat these bosses. You're usually looking for a glowing weak spot on them, but how you actually access that weak spot can be a combination of using your environment, cleverly climbing the enemy, mounting the enemy, getting to look in a certain place.
There's a bunch of different ways. Half of the fun of these enemies is figuring out how you actually get access to them at all, I would say. And then a proper boss phase then kicks in after you've managed to get on top of them and start the process of tracking down their weak points.
And so I picked this one because this is, I think, the game's perfect mix of those parts I keep banging on about. The clever mechanics, the framing, the spectacle. In this game generally, this game is really good at creating anxiety when you find the right location and you're waiting for the Colossus to appear.
And in this case, you're going to a giant empty desert with just a stone ruin in the middle and your light of your sword guides you towards where you're going. So you think, well, OK, I guess I'll just go to this central bit here. And when you do, one of the largest things you will have ever seen in a PS2 game comes out of the ground and it is this flying sand snake thing.
And basically you have to pierce these kind of like white, kind of like pus bag things underneath it in order to make it like come towards the ground. And then you have to ride your horse alongside it and perfectly time a jump onto its little wings where there are these kind of like ladder-like spokes to grab onto on the surface of the wings. And once you're on this like moving, flying creature, it's about stabbing its weak spots, which are below these kind of like shell things on its back.
And you have to like use the kind of fur on top of it to kind of like make your way to the front while the wind is blowing at you. So this game does bosses so well, but this is the most memorable one. Every time I see it, I'm blown away by it.
Matthew, is it a favorite of yours in this game?
There's so many winners in here, and you're right. I'm not very good on their names, I must admit. I'm always like, it's the bird one.
Yeah, bird one's good.
Yeah, I think the ones which have got a bit of like extra speed or kind of an aerial element to them, I really, really like. That's where they come alive. I love this format so much that I was quite, I was almost tempted to put a few like Shadow of the Colossus rip-off bosses on my list.
Because there's like a lot of people have done like slightly bad versions of this, but it's such a cool idea that even a bad version like like perennial Back Page favourite, Castlevania Lords of Shadow, has a few bosses which are like, climb up it, giant back and stab it in the head, and then you win. But they've got none of the kind of visual poetry, none of the restraint, I think, is what works for me in Shadow of the Colossus. It's so kind of calm and cool 95% of the time, and then just extraordinarily rad and overwhelming and scary.
I think that ominous kind of fear, anxiety you mentioned is like a huge, huge part of why this game works. Like it's kind of terrifying, because you look at these landscapes, and you're like, well, I know these things are big, and I can't see them right now. So it's here somewhere, and it's hiding.
Well, how is it going to emerge? And that's like a really effective thing. It does again and again.
It's an amazing game. I've never played the HD remake, and I probably should.
Yeah, it's really nice. I saw a lot of people banging on about the original art style and stuff, and I don't actually think there's loads of merit in that. I think people will just really enjoy this if they just played it, and they wouldn't really notice the differences they would notice.
They'd appreciate it. I think they'd do a great facelift of this. And if you have a PS3, which I know not everyone does, the original version is not lost because the version on there is more visually similar to the original one, of course.
It comes with ICO as well, so the PS3 one is also an alternative there. But yeah, I can never remember their names either, but good ones in this game include the bird one, the underwater one. That's good.
Not as bit fond of the little dog one. You need to like wave a torch at to make him fall off, then climb on his back. He's a bit annoying, but bless him.
He's only trying to live his life in a quiet little valley. You just come along and stab him just to bring your girlfriend back or whatever. So yeah, there's a few others.
I like the one that's on top of the plate with the giant sword that's kind of firing down at you. I like the one that's like in the creepy crawly one that's inside that Colosseum like setting. That's a really cool underground location.
Again, half the fun there is just finding the damn place. It gets quite out of the way. But yeah, this one is like the peak of everything it does well combined, I would say, in an absolute masterpiece of a game.
So yeah, of all the boss battles in Shadow of the Colossus, this is top for me. So Matthew, we come to your final entry.
I've gone with another Platinum game. I've decided to end the list with the not very memorably named Jiginga from The Wonderful 101. I love The Wonderful 101.
I hate the character enemy names. I just think they've got a horrible mouthfeel to them. This is, I mean, you can look this fight up on YouTube if you haven't watched it.
And the fact is that the videos are like an hour long, gives you an indication that Platinum and Karnico are pretty mad with this. You fight this alien kind of invader supreme overlord thing, which is like a big brain basically in space on a spaceship. And you end up sort of destroying the spaceship, having to flee in a kind of a ship section where you're flying a ship through a kind of tunnel with lots of lasers.
You think, oh, this is the end of the game. It's like a big dramatic escape. You get outside of the ship and then the boss uses the sort of smoldering remains of the ship to build an even bigger body for you to fight.
And it just keeps scaling up and up and up and up. And like mechanically, I think that there maybe are individually, like, better fights, more interesting fights. I was very, very tempted to include one.
There's a brilliant fight, which is basically like a riff on Punch Out, where you've got two giant fists and you're sort of controlling a big sort of mech to punch robots. And you drive your fist into the other robot's head and then you make all your little characters run along the arm into the other end, into the enemy and carry on like the boss fight inside it, which is just like a classic cameo, big scale, little scale, big scale, little scale thing, which I really love. This one just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
To come back to our earlier question about quick time events, it ends with a huge quick time event where you build a massive laser, which the name of which I wrote down because it just made me laugh at how dumb it is. It's the final, ultimate, legendary, earth power supermax, just this miracle dream, beautiful galaxy, big bang, little bang, sunrise, starlight, infinite, fabulous, totally final, wonderful arrow.
Are we sure this game was directed by Hideki Kamiya? Can we be sure of that, Matthew?
You end up firing this giant laser and it ends with you just mash A and it comes up with the quick time instruction, protect earth to save the earth, you just have to mash A a lot and this laser gets bigger and bigger. And at this point you've sort of summoned the collective force of earth behind you. See, you're in space charging up this laser, the earth is behind you spinning faster and faster as your laser gets bigger.
It keeps cutting to all the characters inside the spaceship, also mashing buttons like you are. So it feels like you're mashing buttons, you can hear your button mashing their mashing buttons, you can hear their buttons mashing and it goes on for so... This quick time event goes on for so long that they play like the game's entire theme tune during it, which is the wonderful 101 like song.
So it starts singing like the superhero kind of Saturday morning cartoon theme tune. This collision of like your taps, their taps, this music, this crazy laser on screen, it is just the best final moment in a game in terms of just pure mad scale. One of their weirder games, definitely one of his harder games to pass and get your head around.
But if you get into the wonderful 101, I think it delivers in such a massive way that I've now spoiled. But you can't really spoil it, that's the truth. You have to kind of see this and how it's executed to really enjoy it.
And the trip there is so wild, so packed with these highlights.
Yeah, very good. Just in the background, I have bought a copy of this for $13.99 on Amazon on Switch. So that will be with me soon.
That seems well worth it, doesn't it?
Yeah, I love one of the 101.
I'd pay 14 quid not to get the Wii U out, to be honest, so that's fine by me. Yeah, I always kind of love the aesthetic of this game, but never quite cracked it. Played it a few times.
Love the different settings in it, but yeah, maybe this will be the time that it gets me, Matthew. But I did see this on a few lists of the best boss battles. So again, not just you for this one, but yeah.
There you go. I feel supported by my fellow lovers of God in space.
So great stuff, Matthew. We have done the lists, our top five boss battles there. I think a really good variety there.
I would say that generally speaking, rather than being a straight top five, it's more like the five types of bosses I like, and these represent the best of those types, I would say, is kind of how I did it a little bit.
I started off with this clever idea of really doing that, and each one being a big archetype of boss fight, but I like Platinum going mad too much, so I did two of those.
Yeah, I tried to pick basically a Metal Gear boss, a FromSoft boss, a Destiny raid boss, an RPG boss, and then a boss from a game of bosses. That was kind of how I went for it.
It's very elegantly done. This is the level of deep thought that people are paying for in this Patreon tier.
Please don't unsubscribe now that you've heard that. So yes, you also originally had The Stranger from God of War on your list at one point, Matthew, because the notes document I'm using says that. What was the thinking behind trimming that in the end?
I've only played God of War, that's the 2018 version, the one time, but it really, really registered with me. That's where the game already picked up. If you haven't played it, you're kind of bobbling around as Kratos for an hour or two, and it's kind of low-key, and you fight a big troll thing, and then you meet this sort of strange man who…
he's the stranger, you have no idea who he is, and you have this kind of three-phased fistfight where it sort of awakens some of the old Kratos. It's where he kind of kicks back in, and kind of cut from the same cloth as that thing I was saying about the Platinum, kind of like human versus human, where it's quite a simple, low-key fight in terms of scale. But as you both begin to tap into your godlike powers, it just gets a bit more exciting.
I mean, the thing there that really wowed me is I still think it's kind of like some of the best use of that game's single camera format. Like, the movement in the arena, and you get punched through a mountain at one point, and the way the camera kind of keeps up and frames it, that was the moment where I was like, oh, holy shit, they're really doing this, and they're not cutting corners. This is a very complicated fight to frame and keep up with, and they're doing it.
And in a way, I kind of prefer it to any of the bosses that follow. There's some other really good ones in the game. For that initial wow factor, and I guess the narrative angle as well of this idea of this kind of character awakening, I really like the idea of this sort of mysterious guy who seems to know Kratos' past, and he's sort of like, you know, I've kind of heard about you, and I was kind of expecting something more, and he seems to know like what he's done in his past.
That's really interesting. It was very flashy, but I just wanted to celebrate the other ones more.
No, that's fine. I mean, yeah, it definitely is a memorable way to start that game. And yeah, I've got a lot of love for the spectacle in that game, for sure, for at least the bits I've played anyway.
So we've got some more memorable mentions here, Matthew. I'll just fire into one of mine. They won't take long, I'm sure.
But Mr. Freeze in Arkham City is one I wanted to pull out. This is kind of structured a bit like a Metal Gear boss fight, where the only way to damage him each time is to use a different bit of the environment or a different tool that Batman has, but you can only use that one tool once, so you're basically running down the list in order to kind of topple him. Matthew has been on record as being a bit apathetic towards this boss fight, but I don't get any thoughts on Matthew.
It sticks out as quite a good story character as well, because Mr. Freeze is kind of a villain in Batman, but not quite a villain in the same way the Joker is. He's a little bit more of a motive, a little bit less cartoonish in his overall origins. He's quite a tragic figure.
Any thoughts on this?
I get that it's quite a clever stealth puzzle boss, which I like. Generally, bosses are quite a weak point in Batman, given he has some of the most iconic villains of all time in all pop culture. It's kind of mad to me that these games aren't stuffed with absolute dazzlers, and this is definitely one which is mechanically more memorable.
A lot of them are quite boring fights against big things. I get why this is celebrated, but maybe it was hyped up a bit much by the people who were reviewing it. I had a lot of people go, wait till you get to the Mr. Freeze fight, and then you're like, oh, OK, I can't use Batarangs, or I can't use vents.
Yeah.
I will say as well, I don't think the series generally has very good bosses in it. I would say it's not a series of great bosses. Some of my favorites actually in the Arkham games are ones where they're just one-off characters, where they're knocked out in a single punch.
The Mad Hatter stuff in Arkham City is good for that. It's kind of like a concept boss. Professor Pig's a bit like that in Arkham Knight as well.
I like the idea of a boss who basically doesn't necessarily have a giant health bar you're wearing down. It's a little bit more like, well, what is the setting like? That sort of thing.
I think that's where they do well, less so the giant titan fights where you get on a dude and get him to knock some other dudes around. That's less interesting. So why don't you hit me with one of your honorable mentions, Matthew?
There's a Sunset Overdrive DLC. It's called Rise of the Machines, I think. It's called something way more complicated than that.
It's like a real eye roller of like a rise of the machines who want revenge against the computers or something dumb like that. All through Sunset Overdrive, it had this very annoying element that there are TVs all over the city that played videos about Sunset Overdrive. They were like in-game adverts for Sunset Overdrive starring the community manager or a guy, an actor posing as a community manager.
I'm not entirely sure for Insomniac who made it. In this DLC, all these nanobots get into the TV network and basically build a boss, which you have to fight the community manager in these TVs. So they got the actor again to record all these lines where he's like, it's me, I'm gonna kill ya, I'm sick and tired of being disrespected by the fanbase and all that stuff.
It's really meta, but it actually really, really works. It's a great payoff to something I hated about the main game that you finally get to wreck this human guy on a TV screen.
Right. This game is mega underrated. I've been playing it a bit lately.
This is like one Series XS patch away from re-entering the discourse, I think, as a great, unloved, modern classic. It's got everything I like about an open world game in it. We should save it for a future episode, because I reckon we could probably chuck it into something that we're going to do in the future.
But yeah, good game, and it sounds like a cool boss.
Yeah, it is fun. It's mad that the best boss is hidden in a bit of DLC, but there you go.
Not to spoil your next one, but you had Horizon written there, Matthew. And I thought for a second it was Forza Horizon, and I thought it was going to be like a fucking jeep or something. That would have been good.
The big hovercraft from Forza Horizon 4, and it is good.
I'm going to throw two together here to try and get through them a bit faster. So I've got Sephiroth from Kingdom Hearts here. It kind of seems like a weird one, but I like the idea that this was only added in the international version of the game, I believe.
But basically that Final Fantasy VII's boss becomes like a super boss in this game. You fight him in the arena in the Colosseum, and basically he turns up. There's a little cutscene.
You see his one wing, and it's really nicely done. He's got this giant fuck-off sword. He's the hardest enemy in the game, and it's about being able to basically block his attacks when he hits you, being able to move fast enough to bat in from behind with your big ki.
I generally wanted to shout out Kingdom Hearts here, because while I think that the camera in these games is never quite perfect, the combat is arguably has less depth than a lot of 3D action games. I think it always does tactile bosses quite well, the feeling of bosses. A lot of bosses you climb up and hit in the head and stuff, and I think it sells that scale quite nicely.
I've always liked that about the bosses in Kingdom Hearts. They feel quite... There's no kind of corners cut in how they're presented to you.
The scale is very impressive, and right from the first game they were doing that. But I picked Sephiroth, so I just think it was a great idea to have an optional super boss being this kind of like another Final Fantasy character, of which there are many in the game. So that's one, Matthew.
I imagine you have no thoughts on that, because you're not a Kingdom Hearts guy.
I was going to say something snide about like, does he like tag team with Jiminy Cricket or something?
Not this time, no. But yeah, so the other one I was going to mention was Anubis in Zone of the Enders, the second runner. The reason I picked this one is because it was probably one of the nicest looking things that I saw happen on the PS2.
You fight this boss once earlier in the game and you can't beat it because it can teleport before you can hit it with all your attacks. You come back later on with an ability called Zero Shift, I believe it is, and you can basically teleport yourself. It's like a kind of frantic chase as you kind of go after this big mech that looks like the Egyptian god Anubis and try and batter it with your swords and rockets and stuff.
In an environment that looks like peak Yoshishinkawa.
In the sense that I think you're surrounded by floating hexagons, I think. It's like having a boss battle inside the Metal Gear Solid 2 opening credits. It's quite nicely done, and when Anubis attacks you, he shoots all this red shit at you that looks amazing on the PS2 for the time.
That's another one I wanted to pick for Spectacle, really. I just really love this as an end boss. Those are always beautiful looking games.
So Matthew, hit me with a couple more of yours or one of yours, whatever you like.
You haven't played Horizon for the Midwest yet, have you?
No, but go ahead.
I won't get into big spoilers or anything. This isn't even really a proper boss fight. It's something that happens quite early in the game.
This super-powered chap turns up and you have to escape him, and it's like a puzzle with a boss on your tail. He's so overpowered, and the way they illustrate how at ease he is and how unthreatened he is by anything you can do, is he's very calmly whistling in the hall of the mountain king, the thing, you know the song, the da-da-da.
Right. He's casually whistling it, and it just really jumped out at me. It's like what a brilliant way of showing just how cocky a character was, that he can do this in the heat of battle.
Like I say, the actual fight is nothing complicated. I assume you fight him again later. I've not played enough of the game to find out, but it just really registered with me in a way that I didn't think anything Horizon could do would register with me like that.
What an unusual characterful touch for this game, which I found quite cold and unfeeling in a lot of ways. A little shout out to him. I think he's called Eric.
Nice. It's the first time, I think, on the record, you have praised a Horizon game on this podcast, Matthew. So the Patreon subscribers are getting that as the nice exclusive.
Go and tell the non-Patreon subscribers what happened here today.
This is viral marketing at its best.
You won't believe what you said. I liked it when the guy called Eric whistled. But listen, that's a big step.
Our lists were notably Resident Evil 3.
Yeah.
Resident Evil is kind of another classic kind of boss series, like Capcom are, they are good at bosses. The Platinum guys are all ex-Capcom. They all learn their kind of craft there.
I imagine a lot of this comes from, like, specifically McCarney is good at bosses. And it drips down into lots of other people, like all his acolytes.
Well, it could arguably be said that their, you know, their heritage is in arcade games, right? And boss battles are an arcade-y concept. Megaman is a like, you know.
But I think, like, in terms of, like, nailing them in the 3D space, that generation forwards, there's more of, like, where, like, Mikami comes from.
Yeah, it's a different, it's a different era of bosses, for sure.
Yeah. I struggled to pick out, like, an individual fight, which I thought, like, oh, this was, this individually was so, so good. But I like the enemies that you fight several times through a game, where the boss fights escalate and get wilder and wilder.
Like, you look forward to seeing them, like, one more time, and every time you kind of off them in a more horrible way. It's something that, you know, as hit and miss as I think it is, I think the Resident Evil 3 remake, Nemesis fights are, like, quite spectacular, and particularly the last two, where you sort of bathe him in acid and then, like, laser him through with, like, a giant death laser, are kind of, like, thrilling, really entertaining, big ending to that game. Like, that game sort of ends on a nine, even if it doesn't ever quite get there for the rest of it.
Yeah, yeah, I think that's fair. Yeah, so try to think about Rezi fights, Rezi boss fights that I like, and it's tough because there aren't necessarily, like, standouts. Even in Rezi 4, like, I know a lot of people like that fight in the barn, but when I played it last time, I wasn't as fond of it.
I found it a bit fiddly. I don't like the big monster in the lake that much. I don't really like the...
Kraus is probably my favorite of all of them, but, yeah.
They've got a lot of things which are just, like, big monsters you sort of dodge for a bit, and then you have to shoot a very fiddly sniper bullet into a heart. Like, that happens a lot in Rezzy, and it's always like, oh, don't be a thing where, like, when I get stuck on a Rezzy boss and I look up a walkthrough and they're like, oh, for this, you just want to use, like, all your magnum ammo, all your sniper ammo. It's like, I don't have any of that.
Like, what's the walkthrough for, like, pistol guy?
Yeah, and that kind of goes right through to, like, Rezzy Village where it's, like, you know, that big goo monster thing. You fight by the windmill, who can rain acid down on you and stuff, and it's like, oh, yeah, we're still doing this. You know, very similar kind of vibe.
So, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, and I wrote in the document Oosternak from Resident Evil 6, which is, like, sort of shit nemesis, but you also fight it so many times that by the end you're quite fond of it. And it's probably Stockholm Syndrome, where you're like, oh, here he is. And, like, what are we going to do this time?
We've got to dunk him in lava. Nice.
Was that the thing that pursues Leon in the game?
I don't even know what it's been to be. It's just like a big, muscly flesh man.
You know me, I love a bit of Rezzy 6 discussion. I love going to bat for a game that probably doesn't deserve it. That's something I love doing on this podcast.
Rezzy 3 came up on the Discord, actually, Matthew, just before we were recording this. I don't know if you saw the discussion there.
I think for people buying it now, because you will only ever pay 16 quid to play it now, it's well worth it for 16 quid. It's absolutely worth smashing through in five or six hours. It's like a high 7, that game, I think.
I think it's become slightly underrated just because it got battered so much for not being Rezzy 2 Remake. So yeah, that's a good selection. Any more to add on the Rezzy boss front, Matthew?
No, not really.
Yeah, well, I'm fond of how the game ends, too. That is a proper game ending right there. My next one is Andros Trueform in Star Force 64 or like that one over here.
You fight the big monkey head to finish the game, but to really finish the game, you have to fight his true form, a floating brain with eyes. It's really fucked up. I'm very fond of this.
Again, I'm just kind of picking it because the shock factor is the reason I picked this. It's really quite nasty and strange. It just adds an element of horror to the end of this.
Very Kirby.
Yeah, very much so. That was one I wanted to pick out. Speaking of Kirby, actually, Matthew, because I mentioned your theory about...
I can't remember who the guy is who came in, the guy in 2010-ish who came in.
Kumazaki.
Yeah, Kumazaki. I shared that theory with our friend of the show, Jay Bayliss, and he said that there's actually a fucked-up Evangelion-type monster at the end of Kirby 64, the Crystal Shards, so he theorized the fucked-up Kirby-ness went back even further, but I'll let him litigate that offline.
Yeah, Sakurai had nightmare in Dreamland as well.
Perfect. Matthew's well ahead of it.
Kirby's Adventure, sorry. My bad.
That's fine. You got nothing on this guy.
I've pushed all the Kirby from my brain now that we've done the episode.
So yeah, Andros Trueform, that's one of mine. Just like, again, a nice kind of shock. Like, oh, and also this is what's really happening.
The shock should be that you kill the monkey head and then you go behind its waterfall and you find its single flower and learn that it got sick from having a centipede in it.
I think you should fight a brain and then it turns out to have a little monkey inside. I think that'd be a better boss.
Oh, and it just keeps getting... It's like a blubushka where it just keeps going monkey brain, monkey brain, monkey brain until it's either a tiny monkey or a tiny brain.
That can be like the Bloody Palace mode that they add to Star Fox 64.
People are like, Oh, do you remember that Star Fox mode where you end up fighting a monkey that's one pixel big? That was so weird.
Yeah, it was impossible to finish because you couldn't hit it. Very good, Matthew. What's your next one?
I toyed with putting a Yakuza boss fight in my list. I don't like the fighting systems in Yakuza enough. I'm bad at fighting and we talked about this on the Yakuza episode, but I really like how a lot of these games end with just like a massive punch up between two really emotional dudes who can only express their emotions by thumping each other in the face.
And they tend to end with like just absolute slugfest where it's last man standing and they both look really knackered by the end of it. Throw in some mad quick time events. I've watched videos of people who are really good at Yakuza combat playing these games.
And when I watch those videos, I'm like, oh, yeah, this fight looks way better when he did it. Like when I did it, I was basically eating a bento box every 10 seconds to get my health up and then just hitting him with like couches. Like that is every Yakuza boss fight for me.
It's like if that room has got furniture, I am making a fucking bee line for that furniture. The fight I really loved is the very last boss of Judgment, the spinoff. I won't say who the character is, because it's kind of the villain you're trying to uncover for the whole thing, but they're known as the Mole throughout, is their code name.
And you just have this like four or five stage fight in a hospital against this mad bloke. And it gets quite a little bit sort of, they're not super powered, but it's almost a little bit superhero-y, where people are like jumping off windows and doing all these kind of mad slams and throws, which are definitely beyond like human capabilities. But it's like raining outside and there's thunder and lightning, and it's just, it's really, really cinematic.
And by the end of it, you're like, one of us is going down, we're both on our like last sliver of health. It's, that game gets like the, I guess what the emotional payoff of a boss fight should be, where like, you just feel like everyone's tired and you're like, this was a real, everyone's like panting and they're battered and bruised and yeah, like it repeats the trick again and again. But the, you know, the cinematography and the choreography of like the QuickTime events is just absolute chef's kiss, even with me hitting everyone with sofas, which I do do.
And stopping for those Benno boxes.
Honestly, like, it's like, this is the, you know, when it comes up with like, this is the point of no return, I'm like, straight to one of those convenience stores. And I'm like, I'll take ten of everything.
Oh, God, when I played UQ's Zero and got to the end bit when you're on that boat, and there's like a load of massive fights going on, and I realized that when the game loaded up again, I don't think it loaded all your bento boxes in, like those were consumed and gone. I just started to fucking panic that I was like, tracked in a cycle of never finishing this boss, because I'd gone in with like, you know, nine, very like good, like the most expensive bento boxes, and they were all gone. I just thought, oh, fuck, this is it.
I'm never going to finish this game. It's going to be so embarrassing. Good stuff, Matthew.
Great. So my last, my last honorable mention here is going to be Ishin in Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, the final boss of the game. Takes place in the setting where you fight the game's first boss, which is a nice bit of symmetry.
I picked this because I think, again, he represents a really interesting challenge in the game. You can, you can properly learn him. But the absolute fucker about this one is that he's got a fourth phase.
Like, three phases kind of has like, it makes sense in your head. You're like, well, yeah, that's, that's probably the maximum number that a boss, most bosses would have, rule of three kind of thinking to it, I guess. But then the fourth, fourth phase is the one where he just starts chucking lightning bolts at you.
And I like, I put quite a lot of effort into learning how you fire the lightning bolts back at him. And I think when I beat him the second time, I think I did it with like firing a lightning bolt back. And that was like, that was the parting shot I got on him.
And I kind of really loved that. But yeah, another great one to learn. I think Sekiro's bosses, all the best ones are the straightforward one to one sword encounters where it's like a perfect kind of like challenge for your movement, knowing when to jump, when to like dodge the side, when to parry, when to do the kind of perfect sort of counter attack.
Yeah, all that stuff. It just does so, so well. So, yeah, this is a great boss, Matthew, but you've never seen it, right?
So, yeah.
No.
No, it's very similar to Genichiro Ashina. It's kind of like a plus version of that, really. Very similar.
Like basically...
God, I can't do the minus version.
Well, the regular version of Genichiro Ashina basically sheds his skin and there's a different dude underneath it. I think that's what happens. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, fucked up, man. It's real bad there back in feudal Japan or whenever it's bad times. Okay, great.
Well, we've done the first Patreon episode, Matthew, Back Page XL, then the first one's in the can. We should have tweeted what we're doing for the rest of the year by now. I'm not committing to them on air yet because I don't think me and Matthew have actually greet them in IRL yet.
But that was really fun, wasn't it? It was good to dive into.
It was fun. And that was Excel. I think we covered that pretty comprehensively.
Yeah, I think it just maybe had a bit less of a superficial roundup of a thing and more of a deep dive into a thing, which was kind of the goal.
Yeah, I think that was sort of the aim of it, wasn't it? That we were going to use this for stuff that we wanted to kind of dig into, but we maybe hadn't found a neat way of folding into our regular schedule, which tries to be maybe a bit more reactive to stuff that's going on, I would say.
Yeah, for sure. But there will be some good stuff in the can, too. And like I say, if we hit that 600-pound mark, then we will unlock a second podcast at the five-pound-ish tier, whichever tier we set that at.
I might have adjusted it for VAT or some bullshit. I don't know yet. I haven't dug into the Patreon backend.
Very well prepped for this, aren't I? So, yes, thank you very much for listening. You, I'm sure, listening at home know where to find us.
It's patreon.com backpagepod if you'd like to recommend us to your family and friends. And yeah, and we're backpagepod on Twitter, of course, where we tweet about new episodes and that sort of stuff. The Discord link you'll find there too.
If you go in there, we'll create a specific Patreon channel so you can talk about stuff that's going on with the Patreon stuff, add suggestions, that sort of thing. I will not be taking any more channel requests in the Discord though. Please note the listeners.
But if you are a Patreon, we'll be a little less short with you on Discord.
Much nicer. Hey, thanks for being here. But no, we're not having a channel on sandwiches.
Thank you, goodbye.
But it's a great idea.
Okay, so where can people find you on social media, Matthew?
MrBazzill underscore Pesty.
I'm Samuel W Roberts. Thanks for your support and we'll be back next month with another episode of Back Page XL. Goodbye.
