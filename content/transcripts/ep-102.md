Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, after two months of playing through the entire series, I'm ready to rank the God of War games. We'll decide where Ragnarök goes in the list after we've played it. Just to say right up front, very up front, we have not played Ragnarök yet.
We are not on the list. Did you even try and go for Ragnarök as a review, Matthew?
No, no, that would have absolutely killed me with my current workload. We should call this episode God of War, Ragnarök.
Oh yeah, but if it doesn't have Ragnarök in it, that kind of maybe doesn't work.
It doesn't matter, because it's more about the ranking than the rock.
God of War Games, Ragnarök. Okay, we're doing that. That's going in the title.
It will probably harm its pick up on iTunes and similar platforms, but fuck it. We don't have shareholders. We have no one to impress.
Yeah, okay, good rank in the rock.
It's off to a good start already.
I think so, yeah. So yes, Matthew, this episode is all about the God of War games. I have played through the entire series, including the handheld ones.
The only one I've not played is that mobile game spin-off or the Facebook game they did. Those don't really count. We're just doing the main ones on PSP, PS2, PS3 and PS4 in this episode.
So, yeah, I'm really excited to discuss it. But the important thing to start with is how was the Banshees of Erna Sharon? Did you enjoy that Oscar-worthy movie, Matthew?
I did enjoy it. I thought it was absolutely fantastic. But talk about like tonal gear shift going from that film to God of War.
Like two universes have never been more unlike.
Yeah, exactly. It's sort of like God of War would have a very different edge if it was about sort of, if Zeus and Kratos were like two old buddies who just couldn't get along anymore and wouldn't go to the pub with each other.
There's some surprising gratuitous injury in Banshees, which I guess is probably like the very tiny bit of the Venn diagram crossover.
Did you like the memes I sent you on Twitter, Matthew?
Oh, they were good. They were fantastic memes. Well, this is the thing.
So people who haven't seen the film, like Colin Farrell is best mates with Brendan Gleeson. And then one day Brendan Gleeson is just not friends with him anymore and doesn't want anything to do with him. And it's like two hours of Colin Farrell being sad and trying to work out why.
But everyone leaves that film thinking, oh, am I a, like, you'll either feel closer to a Brendan Gleeson, like, oh yeah, I've had annoying people. I've kind of pushed out my life. Or you'll feel like Colin Farrell and think, have I been pushed out of someone else's life for being boring?
Yeah, it's funny because I think it does evoke that quite strongly. It does make you delve into your memories a bit. I went right back to when I was, like, 10.
And when, ironically, it was this Irish kid in this, like, really shitty resort in Mallorca I was in who had firmly had enough of me after, like, three days. I think I was, at first he was, like, a bit friendly and then he just stopped talking. And so when I was talking, there was no response.
And I thought, eventually I got the idea. And I was like, okay, I won't bother. But I was like, why do I remember that, like, two decades later?
Why have I not got something better to think about than this? But it does stay with you when that happens, right? Like, yeah, sad, isn't it?
Definitely. Some memories of, like, you know, coming to future and being desperate to be friends with, you know, journalists I'd grown up reading. And now you look back at that and think, was I an annoying Colin Farrell to them?
Like, that definitely happened with PC Gamer. When I went for, like, the first time I ever went out for drinks, when I first joined future, at the end of the first week, I got invited out by Cris to go out with PC Gamer and was so boring, had so little to say about any PC gaming to them, that I basically never went out with PC Gamer again for about six years.
So is he right for not having anything to say about Morrowind mods, Matthew? Like, how embarrassing for you.
Oh, yeah, you have to be able to hold court with those guys on PC games, or you were basically out. I said something boring to Kieran Gillan, and that was it, done.
He should have asked him about fucking Records or Thor or whatever, those things, that his comic books are about, that would have got you on side with him. Yeah, okay, such as it is. Yeah, I think, I never worry about intellectually disappointing someone like Colin Farrell does, because I know I'm not like that limited, I suppose, as a person.
I feel like I've always got something I could go to. But definitely, I can be as annoying as that. And so that's why I identify a bit of myself in him, for sure.
I think it also helps, even though he's incredibly handsome, obviously, he does have the look of, the visage of a sad muppet in that film, like with his big eyebrows. So he does look like a very upset muppet, and that adds something, I think.
Yeah, a powerful, elastic face. He really can look simple, which I hadn't really read. You know, Colin Farrell, I think, of quite a high energy, and yeah, that was a different performance.
He's a good actor, Colin Farrell. It's my hot take.
Yeah, he made bad choices for about 15 years, and then the last five years has just made really good choices, or maybe the last six, seven years. So yeah, good for him. So back to God of War then, Matthew.
This podcast is going all over the place. So how are we going to do this? We've got two sections, as usual.
Section one is preamble. That's all I've written for the subtitle. We're down to like meat and potatoes now with this podcast.
Then section two will be the ranking after a little musical break. The format by now, if you've listened to this podcast before. If you haven't and you saw the word Ragnarök and you thought, oh, I want all in on this, now you know the deal, so that's good.
So Matthew, what was your first encounter with The God of War games? Do you remember this?
Yeah, not a time I was hugely invested in PlayStation because I would have been at university and what games I did play were on GameCube, but I was probably at my most distant from games in 2004, 2005. So the story of this game emerging doesn't... I couldn't really tell you what that is, but I remember a big scoring game automatically pings on your radar.
I definitely bought it and played it at home and thinking, oh, this isn't necessarily my cup of tea. Like, I wasn't big into kind of brawlers or hack and slash kind of action games back then. I didn't really get into those until a little bit later where I then went back and kind of replayed the classics.
So, yeah, I have a very distinct memory of that giant button cue appearing above the Hydra at the opening and thinking, oh, this is a bit different. This is flashy and big and impressive, certainly very, very shiny. So, yeah, like I kind of stumbled into it kind of slightly blind, to be honest.
Yeah, I think it was not really on my radar as a series until the second one came out. I got the impression that this series was big or in the US than it was in Europe initially. And so the first one was a big success, but then the second one was like a massive success.
So by the time I joined Play in 2007, I joined just after that game had come out. And so there were quite a few people in the office who were big into it, big into the vibe of it. It was like a sort of age of quite overtly masculine games, I suppose you had like this and Gears of War happening at a similar time.
Yeah.
And so the kind of like the sort of violence of it was appealing to people. I did think it was distinctive actually, because I personally felt like that Sony had not necessarily built up its own library of iconic characters and series that were selling the platform. Like when you look at the PS2's lifespan, you know, the games that sold it were Final Fantasy, GTA, GTA mostly.
They did have Gran Turismo, of course. And, you know, one of the games that the studio that made God of War Studio Santa Monica made before that series was Twisted Metal, which again, was like a very US-centric success, I think. I never got the impression that had much of a following.
Not a big, what was that clown called? Sweet Tooth?
Yeah, I think so, yeah. Some of that.
Not a big Sweet Tooth guy?
No, not massively. I did play a bit of Twisted Metal Black and it was all right. I think like there was an online version that only released in the US.
But I suppose I never really felt like Sony had it completely together on what their big exclusive strategy was. And that was obviously about to become a big deal in the PS3 era. And so you're watching them figure out on the fly.
Obviously, they had Jak and Daxter. But God of War was the only adult thing they had, I suppose. It was notably adult compared to a lot of the games at the time.
And I think it illustrated how maybe mainstream games were changing at the time to try and appeal to this audience. Maybe off the back of GTA, there's an increased interest in violent, mature games. And so, yeah, God of War 2 seemed to basically perfect the formula people liked in the first one.
And then it was a bit, I suppose, a little bit awkward in the sense that it arrived just as the PS3 had landed with a thud. You were kind of like, if this thing had launched with God of War 2 in the shiny PS3-O-Vision, that actually would have been a massive deal for them out of the gate. But, such as it was.
Yeah, that's interesting. I think one of the reasons it maybe did arrive, the reason I sort of bought it is that it was really, it's always been a very games magazine-friendly series, because I feel like the games cram so much variety in terms of setting and locations and bosses, that it's very, very easy to fill four pages of the magazine where every screen looks really exciting. These games are made for box-outs of like, it's the freaking colossus fight in a box-out, or it's the opening fight to God of War 1 in a box-out, whatever.
So it definitely popped on the page. I would have read a Games Master review, I think, at the time and bought God of War 1. So yeah, it's just the perfect game for the time.
Yeah, I think so. I think as well, what is great about that first one is how it arrives as a complete package, basically. All of the fundamentals of the series are there.
All the bits, they would change, were not really core elements of the series. All of the movement and the animations and the dynamic of the combat and the enemy types were all basically set from the start, which I think just demonstrated a massive amount of conviction in what the team knew what they were doing, basically. It was just persistently huge, and then when I was working on play, I reviewed the first PSP one, and so that was a moment where I got more into the series.
Then I tried to get into it again with God of War 3, but sort of bounced off of it and then didn't really revisit it for a long time, until now. That was my early encounter with it. I was picking it up, thinking it was pretty good.
But the other thing was that I was a huge Devil May Cry fan at the time. It just didn't have the combat complexity of Devil May Cry. In my head, I made that direct comparison, but having played more of this series now, all of this series, in fact, I realized that that's not actually an apt comparison point, even though they're both 3D action games.
God of War is intended to be a lot broader. It's much more about spectacle.
I've often thought that God of War is to Devil May Cry what Mortal Kombat is to Street Fighter.
Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's like the American version. It's like incredibly shinier. Probably a bit easier to pick it up and make it do the nasty stuff on tap, but maybe not quite the same level of mastery or necessarily depth that you completely lose yourself in.
A lot more obnoxious. Broad is definitely the right word.
The original God of War was directed by David Jaffe, who was one of the creators of Twisted Metal. He was inspired to make a sort of like Clash of the Titans style, sort of like game for adults. He was interested in doing with Greek mythology, what basically Onimusha had done with that particular period Japanese setting.
So that was like a key influence on it. And at the same time, he drew influence from Ico in terms of like physicality to the puzzles. Obviously in Ico, you play this little horned boy who would pull things around and make levers work and stuff like that.
I think that's a very obvious part of the DNA of God of War. And certainly Onimusha, which I think was a little bit simpler to play than Devil May Cry was. I can sort of see the connection there too.
You have like these physical weapons, but also like these magic abilities attached the weapons to. That's where it's a little bit different to Devil May Cry. So yes, that series then sort of runs and runs.
It's a huge deal throughout the latter half of the PS2 era, right into the PS3 era. The games never change massively. And then it kind of spreads onto PSP.
And then the kind of like main story ends with God of War 3 in 2010. But then in 2013, there was a prequel on PS3 also called God of War Ascension, which is made by some of the same team. And again, it kind of attempts to be a sort of full fat God of War, even though it's not technically part of the sort of main story.
The PSP ones too would dial in more on different aspects of Kratos' background as a kind of character and use those as a kind of jumping off point for those games. So it was quite interesting, but definitely the sense that like maybe it was getting a little bit samey towards the end of its run. And so you were years later, there is basically after God of War Ascension releases, there is quite a long period where Studio Santa Monica tries to make a sci-fi open world game with Stig Asmussen who was the creative director of God of War 3 at the helm.
And then the project kind of falls apart. This is around the time that the Studio Santa Monica tries to become a Naughty Dog style, a 1.5 developer, meaning that they would have two projects on the go and they would move people between those two projects. But because the sci-fi game got outright cancelled by Sony, they ended up laying a load of people off.
And around the same time, Cory Barlog, who was the game director of God of War 2, returned to Studio Santa Monica and essentially was there to reboot God of War from scratch. And because these layoffs happened and that other project got shut down, he suddenly had a load of devs dumped on him at once. And so they basically did this ground-up reimagining of what God of War is.
And it was a massive project that carried quite a lot of risk with it. I think that people were a little bit tired of God of War. That was the kind of landscape at the time.
And then would obviously go on to be a huge success. Matthew, I've been talking for ages there, but it's quite an interesting history to me because I think it, I think this entire period, like God of War, better than almost any other series, illustrates how tastes in games have changed, how tone in games have changed, and also the way, the way in which their soul has changed and who their soul too has changed. I think God of War illustrates that really well.
It becomes, it starts as this fairly blokey, violent series and evolves into this quite serious, sort of like narrative centric, credible adventure game that has a much broader appeal. What do you make of the two God of War eras and the evolution of that series?
Yeah, I mean, you know, there are people who try and kind of apply this sort of poetic narrative that at its core you're dealing with a lot of the same people. There are a lot of people who worked on 2018, who worked on original God of War, and the idea is that as that studio ages and matures, in terms of its staff, so it outlook matures. And lots has been written about people saying, God of War 2018 is a lot of dads coming to terms with, they've got different concerns now that they are fathers, or in some cases there were stories of people saying their game development careers had led to them being kind of distant fathers or distant to their families, distant mothers as well, I guess.
And as a result, this game represents where they're at in their own personal development and growth, which is a nice through. I always thought there's something slightly silly about the idea that you have a kid and then all of a sudden a whole new version of the world unlocks and you can suddenly see things in a new light and you don't just want to have sex mini games. To present it as this sort of switch flipping always seemed a bit on the nose to me.
I think it's probably more to do with the time. If you go back and look at the marketing for God of War 1 and 2 and even 3 to an extent, it just comes from a very different era of where games were at. You look at the kind of print ads in magazines, they were just very gratuitous in their violence, very male gaze-y.
There are lots of cringe-worthy clips of the God of War team going, play God of War and it'll get you laid and things like that on PlayStation 2. The weird thing is you probably wouldn't have blinked an eye at that back then. You would have been like, oh yeah, this is just big talk.
Maybe it's just more a case of to release a game in 2018, kind of where it has to be and how that audience has changed, which is a super obvious point, I know, but it's an age in terms of video game development, those 12 years, and it just becomes a game for the time, in the way that it was a game for the times when it started.
Yeah, for sure. It really does illustrate how that's changed, I think, more than any other series because it has persisted as a series and taken such a left turn in terms of tone. It is interesting, though, because Jaffee said from the start, and I don't know if you watched that Game Directors roundtable thing, that felt very of its time, didn't it?
It was like a bunch of blokes shooting the shit a little bit vibe to it.
Yeah, but also quite alfery. One of the interesting things about the series is that until 2018, every game had been directed by someone different, right? And they are all shepherding what I imagine is quite a manic process and a manic team.
And they've all got their own kinds of cockiness, I would say. And I actually found the energy of that interview quite bad.
Yeah, so did I. There were a few penis jokes and stuff like that. And just a very passive female presenter who doesn't really interact with them all that much.
It's very of its time. You almost have to watch it to realise how much the tone of these things has changed, like you say.
It's just a weird bit when they're talking about God of War 3 and they start talking about Kratos being on some branding of some slush puppy drink or something. And it's just this point of pride of like, you know when you've made it, we've hit this kind of merchandise and that does seem so gauche. You would never say that in now.
You wouldn't have said that in 2018, which I think is also part of it. I think that the times dictate it more than this sort of psychological development of the team. It's my personal read of it.
Yeah, but there is also the, I assume you watched the Raising Kratos documentary as well, Matthew?
Yeah.
It does show that there's an influx of new people, right, who helped to craft this.
Absolutely, and I would say from that director interview and just from reading stuff with him over the years, Corey Barlog is kind of the, you know, he's the director of God of War 2, but he was the animator of God of War 1. You know, he's sort of attributed with, even in that interview, David Jaffe says, he's sort of Kratos' dad in terms of he made the character work as an action presence and as a physical presence in the game, which is kind of what, you know, his primary role is in those games, is just to be this like whirling dervish of sort of death. And so, you know, like the idea that you made the character move and work in the game and then in 2, he's clearly a bit more invested in the kind of character arc and the kind of implications of that character.
And, you know, then he kind of returns to it again. Well, Jaffe's a lot more kind of blasé about, you know, sort of sees it in simpler kind of black and white terms, I think. It's clear that in that interview, which is way before the 2018 game, is even like announced, you know, I don't think they even made ascension at that point.
Barlog is clearly like, I have different ideas for this series, you know, I would have maybe have taken it in a different direction. And lo and behold, he returns and he does. And with this a lot more heartfelt thing, like he's definitely, he seems to have the kind of, of all of them, like he seems to have more to say than he necessarily got to say with the game.
Yeah, I agree with that. He also feels like he didn't entirely nail what he wanted to do with Kratos in that second game. Like he, he talks, speaks to that in that interview too.
Yeah, that's not to kind of like ding that, the directors in that too much, because while it is quite outfory, the insights are genuinely fascinating. And to understand, like it's very rare you get to see developers of that level who had worked on the same series next to each other and hear how they all think differently about the same series. It's a real, real good relic.
I do rate Stig Asmussen as well. Like when we get to the rankings and talk about the actual games he directed God of War 3, and we'll see where that fits in the rankings. But he also obviously left Santa Monica and went to Respawn where he directed Fallen Order.
You know, I think he's, I think he is good at these games. I think he has a lot, you know, he's, he's seems a bit, in that interview anyway, he seems a bit more kind of soulful, particularly having to sit there while David Jaffe lays into the end of God of War 3, which is like...
He's a lot of himself, can't he?
Oh, he's so obnoxious. Like, he is God of War 1. Like, actually the games do kind of reflect the people quite neatly.
And, but I think, I think God of War 3 is, is like quite an achievement. And Steg Asboson should be like super proud of that game.
Yeah, I will say though that I do, despite all of Jaffee's YouTube thumbnails and YouTube headlines on his channel, which I'm not terribly fond of, though I did watch quite an insightful video he did about Ragnar, actually, which predates God of War, the 3D Ragnar on PS2, and how it is pretty similar. What he says about his insight on the creation of Kratos is really, is really good. Like, he had such a confident idea of what it should be in terms of tone.
Like, he was like, it does have to be this violent, you know, there has to be, like, violent sex and epic stakes and, you know, all this stuff. He has a firm vision of that, and right down to having the confidence around things like there was a half-colored-in version of, like, the Kratos character design on an artist's screen, and he was like, don't change it. We'll keep that color, this distinctive white and red color palette.
And then he wrote it into the story that, you know, that was basically, like, that was a curse that Kratos had, was the ashes of his family were basically, like, scorched onto his skin permanently, stained onto his skin permanently. And that was just something that, that's a great bit of, like, law and world-building off of, like, you know, a bit of ingenuity. I think that you do have to credit Jaffe for having that vision from the start.
It's all in there in that first game. But yes, that doesn't mean he's not, like, a difficult presence in that kind of interview.
Did you like his pitch for an alternative end of God of War 3? Or should we talk about that when we talk about God of War 3?
Let's maybe talk about that a bit later, because I really rate the end of that game, so we can discuss it. But yeah. Yeah, so it is interesting.
And then, like, the ready at Dawn devs were, who made the PSP games, quite interesting in themselves, too, because they had been given, basically, been advised to make this 25D sort of God of War game for the PSP. But basically, what emerges in that interview is that they were as keen to make a full fat God of War game as anyone else on that panel. It just happens to be they're working with a much smaller canvas.
But we can get into those games a little bit. So to illustrate why I think that Kratos and God of War are significant to Sony, Matthew, it's like, can you name a non-platformer series, and not Twisted Metal either because you mentioned that, a non-platformer series Sony created on PlayStation before God of War? Can you think of one?
Because I think this makes the point about how Kratos sort of sets the template for a PlayStation type of hero, I guess. It was a steady weight for the rest of them. But can you name a non-platformer character from a Sony game before God of War?
Like, does Siphon Filter count?
Oh yeah, that's a good one. That's a good one. But that's all I've got.
Jet Li and Rise to Honor.
Yeah, Siphon Filter is kind of like the flavour of the day. He was a bit of a non-entity of a character, right? He was like a PS1 era third-person shooter character.
Gabe something?
Gabe Logan, yeah. Yeah, so very much of its time. Again, Matthew, you've explained before that that is a series that you like just for using the taser on dudes, and I agree it's the best one.
Oh yeah, that is good. That's one magic trick, but you know, you need more than that for a complete game.
Yeah, it makes for a great demo though, I will say.
Siphon Filter.
Great first level. So yeah, I do think it was really important in establishing this, because you probably do have to look at the likes of Nathan Drake and sort of Aloy and Horizon as kind of following this template of a sort of character so you can build a whole universe around and tell their story and stuff like that. I think that they would become way better at doing this in terms of shedding light on the characters and things like that.
But I do think God of War would herald what came next in terms of those character driven big exclusives that are now just what basically power the engine of PlayStation.
Yeah, and actually there's maybe the tiniest bit of connective tissue between God of War and Uncharted in terms of tapping into a fantasy which is quite kind of tropy and established. Greek myths or pulpy Indiana Jones adventure. And then really boiling down to their elements and delivering that in a big way.
I mean, I've never seen Naughty Dog kind of credit or attribute any of their thinking to God of War in heaven forbid. It seems so crass in its storytelling compared to them. But in terms of a similar approach, I can see a connection there.
Yeah, for sure. I think he represents the pivot away from the era of the platformer, the platforming icon, quote unquote, right? Like the Jack and Dax's, Sly Cooper's, and Ratchet and Clank would persist.
But it did mark this drive towards more mature games. So yeah, it is interesting. I do think you can see the connective tissue with Uncharted for sure.
Matthew, are there parts of the old God of War games that you miss? Would there be anything to gain from making a newer game in that style or even just cribbing bits of it?
The thing about this series is it has a really clear template. And one of the exciting things in the leap from PS2 to PS3 is just seeing what happens to that template when you pretty it up even further and the scope of the set pieces and what you can do. And a little part of you goes, well, definitely a little part of me says, I would happily have seen a God of War 4 in the mould of the original games harnessing PS4 properly or harnessing PS5 properly.
I don't think it's completely tired and dead at all. I thought it had real imagination and just excitement to it. It's almost so different from 2018 that I think it could live on.
It won't. They will never go back to it now because 2018 being the thing that it is. But there's definitely things like specific things I admire about it.
I think they've got incredible momentum. They're so fast on their feet where 2018 by design is a lot more kind of ponderous. It's the difference between a 10-hour game and maybe a 30-hour game.
They share some stuff in terms of 2018 still does the same trick of constantly introducing you to new things, a new enemy, a new puzzle, a new tool, a new gimmick, a new level, which is like a definitive God of War element. But I just played God of War 3 and then went straight into 2018. It's so much like someone hitting the brakes.
You know, you're like, oh, man, like God of War 3 is just, it's so fast and fun. Like it's a simpler thing, but super enjoyable because of it. You know, I certainly didn't have a boring time replaying it.
Yeah, it's sort of, I was there thinking, okay, so as we will get into, I think that this series in that template did run its course, like for sure. And there is like at least two examples of that prove that, I think. But I do wonder if part of that was down to a little bit of fatigue of like the setting and running out of good gods to kill.
Whereas I think that if you did that style of game in a different universe, you know, with the same approach to like making your tiny character feel tiny against a backdrop of huge things, which is what those games do incredibly well. PS4 would do that too. But like certainly this was something that the from the PS2 onwards, they were so good at creating scale.
And, and yes, like you say, the kind of fast moving nature of them, the sort of the idea of these like almost like a WWE style wrestler, kind of like bosses in the gods. Yeah, like those kind of like really big, sort of like slightly ridiculous figures. I think that that applied to a different universe by a developer who was kind of riffing on that would be a really good way to revisit that because I do agree with you.
It's like fast and fun. Yeah, games kind of games that all games are like 20 plus hours now. And you can definitely finish God of War 1, 2 and 3.
In the time it will take you to play that 20, 2018 one.
Right. I do like, you know, to mention a couple of other little specific things, like I really do miss the mad perspective shifts of the older games. Like I think it's really amazing how they do the kind of unbroken take in 2018 and kind of bring you down to kind of Kratos' level.
And seeing some of those set pieces from like over the shoulder definitely, you know, is a technical marvel and like a cinematic framing marvel. But I do. I miss some of the wonder of the flexibility of the older games gives you for sure.
I also kind of miss the incredibly pitch black humor of the older games. Like God of War 2018 has some like funny characters and some warmth in it. But I kind of I love the pettiness of old Kratos.
I love the twisted bitter things he does because he's just so cross. Like they are some of the series highlights and that element of the character is just gone. You know, he's put that life sort of behind him.
And so I understand that that would be jarring, but the glee the older games take in the nastiness like 2018 never really allows itself that, you know, there's great unhappiness whenever he does something which is kind of like classic Kratos, which I think is a bit of a shame.
Yeah, I do agree with you because I think it's really easy to, because of the way that the 2018 game reframes the earlier games, to think of them as relics with no value or relics, or like very much relics from a bygone era that are like, oh yeah, we don't really make games like that anymore. We don't play games like that anymore. But they are like totally special in themselves with some big limitations, which we'll get into in a minute.
And I agree with you that that is part of it. It's like the sheer excess of the violence and like the things he will do just to like basically fulfill his own personal revenge fantasy is, yeah, kind of out of control, but also incredibly entertaining in a way that is quite singular to this series, I think.
Yeah. And sometimes there are moments in 2018, like there are some of the finishes on like some of the bosses or, you know, when he fights the dragon and then kind of like impales on a big spike. That's a classic Kratos move.
But it's just like the tone of it is so different. You know, it's kind of this is a desperate struggle for survival rather than hell yeah, I'm fucking this dragon up with a huge spike, which is what the older games would have would have kind of that would have been their approach. So, you know, it's this stuff, which is like only a kind of step away from being a classic God of War moment.
But they just it's just so much more sophisticated and like po-faced about it.
Yeah, not to its detriment.
No, not at all. Yeah, like you really do have to treat them as almost two separate things and appreciate that. Like, they just they appeal for totally different reasons.
But I'm not sure one is necessarily better than the other.
Right. Yeah, just I think they were just they're just games that reflect their own time periods in different ways, I think.
Yeah.
And yeah, I think I agree with you that maybe that's just like partly an age thing. But that's the I agree with you. I don't think that one type is necessarily worse than the other.
One is just not contemporary. Well, whereas the other is firmly is, you know.
Yeah.
Plus, yeah, I do think that the way they they they reframe parts of that God of War history works really well in that 2018 game. I'm sure we'll get into that. But the other thing is that I found really interesting, so I just played through 2018 for the first time, is that people who plays 2018, which is a game that sold 20 million copies, that is like a fucking monster hit of a thing.
Most of those people, by the numbers, probably about 75% of the audience, doesn't actually know how fucking bad Kratos was, what a piece of shit he was. And I actually, I really love that idea, because while it does reckon with that past, you only get a little glimpse of what he actually did. But that really, that really amuses me.
People are like, oh, wow, yeah, he killed, oh yeah, he killed Zeus, he killed his dad. Isn't that so shocking? Like that guy did a fucking way worse things and beat his dad to death.
I promise you.
And for like no reason. Like he's just, he's so, like everyone gets the most extreme treatment from him. No matter like whether they're his ultimate enemy, he spent a whole game hunting or literally just someone who just happens to be in the wrong room at the wrong time.
Yeah, that is, yeah, that is true. And quite, yeah, quite funny to think about. Because I like having played through all this in a row.
It's like it's the total difference is huge. But it is funny to like make a list of all the things that Kratos did and be like, yeah, he's like he's living with a lot of guilt, you know. So I suppose, Matthew, just to kind of balance things out, what are the elements we don't miss?
What hasn't dated well about these games? I think to start with, right, women in these games, these PS2 and PS3 games, have a fucking terrible time. If you any, the way that like women are treated, but also the way that like, you know, like imagery of women's bodies is used on enemies.
Like basically, if you have, if you have breasts, you're gonna have a bad time in these games. And like that is one way in which they've dated quite, quite terribly. But what do you think?
Is there anything else there that's kind of worth spotlighting?
I mean, that is the biggie. It's so funny. It's not funny.
It's kind of bleak that the God of War Wikipedia has a page titled topless women, which is just bad. Some really terrible platforming puzzles. Not as bad as the blatant sexism, but like these games, I don't think they were ever great platformers particularly.
And they lent into platforming quite a lot. They got better at it. God of War 1 had some truly atrocious platforming in it.
Having played, I haven't replayed all of them for this episode, but I replayed a chunk. And they're very comfortable in their power arc. But every single game kind of has exactly the same flow to it.
And it's sort of something kind of slightly reassuring about it. You know, it's a bit like how the screen films always fold in the same way. And you're like, OK, we're at this bit now.
But, you know, the way he, you know, starts off the pacing of the kind of weapons he gets, the fact that the end of these games always basically drown you in experience. So basically, no matter what you've done, you always end up fully powered up in time for the final boss. And when you play them in succession, that stuff really stands out of like, oh, man, there's just there's not a lot of variety to this.
There is there's some underlying stuff which, you know, I kind of you can understand why they dropped it after six games. And like seven just has such a different, you know, you know, because it is a 30 hour game, it just has such a different like rhythm to it, which which I really appreciate. And I'm glad they didn't like try to honor that part of the series.
Yeah. QTEs as well, Matthew. That was like, yeah, that was a product of the time, right, as well.
It was like there was the hot thing after Shenmue and then Resi 4 and this like the original God of War. So when you play them now and you have to do these like finisher moves on enemies that just require basically just a staggered, slow few button presses to like perform the finisher move. It's quite hard work, right?
Yeah, they really suck. Like mashing the fucking circle button to slowly push your dagger into a minotaur's mouth. Yeah, that's that's good.
Maybe twice. And then you're like, oh, God, I'm going to sit like this. Sometimes there's fights for this, like three minotaurs.
You know, I'm going to be doing this three times in a row. Any of the but I don't mind the ones we just press buttons. I don't really care about those.
It's the mashing that pulling Medusa's head off that I've always hated.
Yeah. Being turned to stone by Medusa and having to shape the stick from side to side. Half a second before they fucking shatter you and it's a game over.
That absolutely blows. The very worst thing in any God of War combat is the fact that if the Medusa's turn you to stone when you're jumping, the fall to earth will shatter you. It's an instant kill if you're in the air and it absolutely sucks.
And it's in every single one of those games as well.
They never changed it, I don't think. I think it's from start to finish. That's a trait that you can get killed.
Really unpleasant stuff.
Yeah, that's rough. Those are basically the only bits, though. But it's primarily like the depiction of women in the series as well.
That's the biggie.
We'll come back to that. Along similar lines, Matthew, you're a big sex minigames guy. Can I ask you about your plumber story?
Can you tell that story?
Oh, right. I was playing God of War 3, replaying it on the remastered version for this episode.
We had a plumber come to check the boiler this week, and he could only come before work, so we had to get up super early. So I let him in, and then I thought, well, as it's so early, I don't need to get to work for an hour, so I'll sit here and play another bit of God of War 3, and it was the bit where you meet Aphrodite, who's the kind of sex minigame in that. I don't know why I triggered it, but knowing that there was a stranger in the house, but I did trigger it, and it was just incredibly loud, and I became hyper aware that the plumber was literally standing next to me while this was going on, and so I quickly tried to turn down the volume and everything, and then I still played the game, because I wanted to get the experience points.
Worth your house, isn't it?
Yeah, exactly, but then it's very easy to trigger the game again at the end, and so I then accidentally triggered it again while Catherine and the plumber were standing by the living room door talking about the plumbing situation, and all of a sudden, I don't know if you remember the one from God of War 3.
I do, yep.
You and Aphrodite are doing your thing, and there are basically these two women watching, the camera pans across to two naked women who are watching this, getting increasingly horny by the sight of what they're watching.
Yeah.
And they're just there going like, oh, this looks so good, and you can always like, sex noise. It's just the fact that I did it twice for this, our lovely plumber, Cris, who like, I mean, that's bad at the best of times, but he must have thought, why are you doing this at half eight in the morning? Like, are you such a like, fiend, that you need this?
Is that more or less mortifying than Catherine catching you cross-matching a pair of brass and or immortality, Matthew? Where's it rank?
That, the thing is, that's fine, because she knows what video games are like, but this was more mortifying than that.
Also, I love the idea of you describing God of War sex mini-games like that. That was great. You should have to do it for every one of these.
Just describe very literally what's going on.
I was going to do a ranking of them, and I thought that was crass.
Yeah, go on, sorry.
I did write down what they all were.
Do you want to read those out?
So, in all these games, at some point in the adventure, you find naked women on a bed, or sometimes not on a bed, and then you begin a game where you hit a quick time event, but the joke always is that it pans away and has a bit of a carry-on, goofy visual hint at what's going on.
That's why 3 is an exception to that, because 3 is just all horny and no carry-on.
Yeah, right. So, God of War 1, your vigorous bonking causes a jug to fall off a nearby table. God of War 2 is really weird.
It's in a pool of water with a pissing cherub statue.
Oh yeah, that is weird.
As you continue the game, the stream from the cherub intensifies until it, like, at the end of the game, sort of like sprays aggressively all over the screen. Which I think is actually incredibly sinister. It's like a kid.
Pissing as well, it's very cursed.
So that's very cursed. Chains of Olympus, which I actually think is, I think this is one of the funnier ones.
Is it a candle?
This is a lit candle spits wax suggestively.
See, that one would be the best one by far, I think. If it didn't have that very weird still image of that one woman topless hanging over the other topless woman and they'd like the same person, same character model like that, that gives it very sinister energy.
That's a PSP limitation. You've got to give Reddit Dawn some kind of like wiggle room here.
Yeah, the candle is good though. Like the candle's like, that's like the best kind of carry on style imagery.
They're like, it's either the same naked woman or it's Kratos again. So those are the two character models we got. Ghosts of Sparta.
This one's quite rowdy. He goes into a bedroom and women are looking through a doorway. And the longer the game goes on, like more and more women are entering and just jumping onto the bed with him.
So by the end, it's like 20 people. You don't see them, but they're like queuing up outside and then basically going, oh, I'll have some of that.
I think you do see them all run in, I think.
Oh, you see them run in, but you don't see them. You just see them jump onto the bed and then you're not... Like the PSP couldn't show you like 20 writhing clones.
Nor should it.
It's like the end of fucking society. God of War 3, two girls jealously watch Kratos with Aphrodite. Ascension has an interesting twist in that you enter a brothel and you think, oh, this will be the minigame and you start getting led by the hand by some beautiful babe who turns out to be a trap by the villain, one of the Furies called Tisiphony.
And I don't think it pulls you into a boss fight, but it definitely pulls you into a little kind of encounter with her. So it's like a fake out brothel moment.
Yeah, it's one of like about I think three in like sort of hallucination fantasy bits in that game. They don't really make the most out of that as a device. I don't think it's very limited.
We'll get into. Yeah, very good, Matthew.
So it's a rundown. I personally, I think the Aphrodite one aside, I think they're just so naff that I'm not personally offended.
I'm not offended by them. They're like actually not really the most offensive content featuring women in these games.
No, they're not violence against women. No, which these games definitely do in places.
Yeah, I think it's like, but it's very much a relic of the time, right?
It's absolutely. There's something about the sound of the controller, like you can hear like your own button presses. And like when you're waggling the stick left and right and then rotating the stick, it just makes this kind of plasticky noise, which I think keeps you, it's like just a constant reminder that what you're doing is like very desperate, that you're wiggling all this plastic to try and make these virtual, you know, boffing happen on screen.
There's something, it's like, I wouldn't say it's like self-knowing, but it's so like in your face tacky. I think they must know what they're doing, but...
Yeah, I think it kind of nicely illustrates the push and pull with God of War between being this quite adult, mature series or story, and it's quite adolescent tendencies. And I think that that tension between those two things exists throughout those PS2, PS3 games and PSP games, I think.
Yeah.
It's that thing of like, is this actually adult or is this just fucking stupid and made for like teenagers? There's like, and the answer is, it's both at the same time, which is a really interesting, I think, tonal conflict in that series. I think we'll get into this more.
But yeah, I'm not a big sex minigame. I'm not massively offended by them. But I do think that like 3 is the one where it's like, I would under no circumstances show that to a friend whose respect I wanted to maintain.
I'll check out this great game that I'm ranking quite high in this list. It's got two very like weirdly rendered women getting it on while there's some sex happening off screen. It's like, do you like static PS3 breasts?
Because it's top notch.
Yeah, I would say the second time you activate it, as I learned with Diploma, the dialogue is slightly different. And they're like, say, I think they like making jokes about, they don't say like, no wonder this game is rated adults only. But she definitely says something about the scene being rated adults only.
And like, yes, I definitely wouldn't let any kids play this or something, the other one says. So I'm not saying that lets it off. But I like the fact that someone had to write alt dialogue for if some saddo like me activates it a second time.
While they're plumbers round. While they're plumbers round. What will happen to Aphrodite at the end of that game?
Because she presumably survives and fucking walks off somewhere into Greece, which has been furloughed.
I think it is quite appropriate that in a game which is like really about you killing all the gods for good, that the erotic mini game is like the goddess of love. It's like the ultimate. Everything in that game is like the ultimate version of itself.
I mean, we've talked about this before.
This is not a horny podcast.
So Matthew, tell me again what happens with the God of War 3 sex mini game. But recap it in twice as much detail. Okay, let's move on.
So last point in this section one, colon, the preamble. Matthew, you excited about Ragnarök? Is this high on your list now for like, you know, I've got to cap the year off with a blockbuster.
I imagine you're hyped about it. How are you feeling about it?
Yeah, absolutely. You know, I really love 2018. I want to see what they do next.
I genuinely want to see, you know, where the story goes. I felt like there was a lot of set up in 2018. In fact, one of my problems with it is I felt like I didn't get to do a lot of stuff.
I thought it was setting up. So I'm hoping that we will get to do it in the next one. Also, you just know it's going to be an incredibly expensive, shiny looking thing, which is just a real treat.
I mean, if the production values of one were anything to go by. And I'm also just interested to see if it follows the trend of this series, where its sequels have always been such a step up. You know, they always have such confidence when they step back into these worlds.
I'm wondering if that kind of characteristic of Santa Monica kind of carries into this. Because, you know, if the leap between 2018 and Ragnarök is the same as between one and two, that would be pretty amazing.
Yeah, there's also the sense of they, you know, they don't have to figure out how to actually make it in the same way they did with the first one. Like in theory, all they have to do is make more content, you know, make more levels, make more story. And so that, you know, you would assume it's a fairly packed game as a result.
Tough break when you've got a game that's got nine realms in it, but you don't have time to, like, build every realm into the game. That definitely, like, sets up that first one as first half of the story. But having caught up on it now, yeah, I am also very excited about it.
I've just avoided all material on it and I'm just like, you know, I only have to wait about nine days so I can play it. So it's exciting.
It doesn't feel like there's that much out there.
No.
Like, I haven't read many, any many big, you know, people have done a round of previews, but they haven't been kind of, like, teasing people into anything. I think a lot of it's quite kind of locked down and, you know, even to the point where, because they did that weird announcement, like a year and a bit ago where Cory Bylogue was like, I'm not directing this anymore, or he sort of moved away from it a bit.
Yeah.
So it has, you know, you wonder, like, was it all smooth sailing or, you know, did this have a bit of a bumpier ride? Who knows?
Had to make it during a pandemic. That's tough.
Maybe, yeah, I imagine that's, yeah, I imagine that's it. Yeah.
Interesting stuff. Yeah, I'm hyped about it too. We have a second episode this month about just about Ragnarök.
Yeah, we hope you like God of War this month.
Yeah, if not, it's going to be a rough one. Come back in December, maybe we'll have some treats for you then. So Matthew, let's take a break.
We'll come back with our ranking of the God of War games.
Let's do it.
So, now we're going to rank the God of War games. Matthew, you had a little sort of like sting in the tail here, or a little sort of additional criteria we can add to this. Do you want to explain what you're going to put in here?
Yeah, I just thought that, you know, all of these games, they have so many little memorable standout moments where Kratos does something kind of like, particularly horrible or violent or interesting. And I just thought, you know, as we go through the games, we should pick out what we think is like the definitive Kratos moment, whether that's like, I was going to just say like, what's the pettiest thing Kratos does in this game? But I'm sure we can highlight some of those too.
But yeah, just the kind of, you know, in games which are full of amazing, memorable moments, what do we think is the definitive Kratos moment from the game?
Yeah, yeah, I like that idea. And I don't know if you've got the same ones as me here, or if you've picked your own ones or whatever, but we can certainly discuss what the moment is for each game, that'd be fun. So we've got seven games in here total.
As mentioned, I have not included sort of like any of the slightly odder spin-offs. Basically, if it wasn't on a PlayStation platform, it's not here. So we start with our number seven, which is God of War Ascension on PS3, released in 2013.
Now, I hadn't played this before this year. This was a prequel game that released after the main story of the battle against Zeus and Olympus was done, basically. Still developed by Santa Monica, shiny PS3 game for the time, arrived right around the end of the PS3 era though.
And I thought it was the game that had the least reason to exist and kind of firmly shows why they needed to reboot it a bit. And I don't know if that's because the formula had been used up, but it felt like it just didn't have the sort of... It's quite a strange blockbuster.
It doesn't feel like it's just got that momentum of, oh, we wanted to do this with this game. It deals with the... Is it the Furies, Matthew, you said there?
Yeah, the Three Furies, yeah. Not to be confused with the Sisters of Fate in God of War 2. Very similar deal.
Yeah, yeah. So, a bit of a sense, they've kind of ran out of the good gods to use by this point too. Just amounts to a very languid and unsatisfying adventure, I think.
Firmly like the worst one, in my opinion. What do you think of this one?
Yeah, I agree with that. I would say, though, I still think the worst God of War has still got a baseline enjoyability to it.
Yeah, it's like a 7 out of 10, probably.
Yeah, and if you were to compare it to God of War clones, it's still probably better than Force Unleashed or...
I would play Dante's Inferno over this one, particularly.
Would you?
Not the others, but this one.
Yeah, Conan the Barbarian with Ron Perlman as Conan.
The THQ one, for sure.
I actually don't mind that as a straight, clear God of War ripoff, very horny and violent. I don't mind it.
That's a vintage THQ seven, that one. Yeah, I think that just from having the different levels of hell in Dante's Inferno, it's visually more interesting than Ascension is, which is strange because it sort of feels like it's about to end and has a fucking massive bit where you're trying to build a big statue or repair a big statue.
Oh, I quite like that bit.
Yeah, I think this game has a few individual set pieces which are visually really superb and the art design is as well executed as anything, but it doesn't hang together. I think the amazing thing with the other God of Wars is you always know what you're doing or what you're working towards at any given time, mainly because the stories are really simple. And this one actually made me realize how easy it is to get a simple story wrong because the motivation, where it falls in the timeline, what's actually going on is quite confusing by God of War standards.
And because of that, all momentum is lost. You're just going through the levels because you're going through levels where I kind of know what the end game is of one, two and three.
I think I needed to play this to realize that the PS2 iteration of Kratos is a bit of a blank slate. There's not loads of complexity to him. He just has this one reason for revenge, and he wants that revenge.
And so I think, like you say, when he's untethered from that in this game, it really just feels like it's ground to a standstill, which is very, very odd. But there's like other stuff in this game that doesn't work for me. There's like this quite long sequence involving these big snakes, where it turns into like NAF Uncharted for about an hour and a half, and you're doing a lot of sliding, and that did nothing for me.
Did you note that that was a bit of a weird Uncharted influence on this game?
Yeah, I mean, because you're in the snowy mountains. It really looks like the Tibet stuff in Uncharted 2. One of the changes mechanically in this is he gets Nathan Drake-style climbing, where he doesn't just go left and right and up and down like old Kratos.
He goes from handhold to handhold, like Nathan Drake. And that, combined with this slightly eastern feeling, snowy level, where you're climbing up shards of this broken mechanical snake. There's shots in this.
I think I sent you one on Discord, which is like... I was like, is this actually a parody of the opening of Uncharted 2? Like, it is exactly the same shot.
It's a really long cinematic platforming sequence, which is just not very God of War.
Yeah, that is all wrong about it. I think it does eventually find a bit more momentum after that. But yeah, sort of just a very oddly paced game.
The other thing I don't think quite works about this is that it kind of trades having a varied armoury for sort of just variations on the Blades of Chaos. You sort of just have elemental versions of those, and they're not very interesting. They don't produce particularly interesting results.
The exception being the one that summons big ghostly hands out of a pawl that just slap a load of enemies around. That's pretty good. Side note, there is also an elephant headed enemy type in this.
I'm very upsetting to kill because I like elephants, and it's not nice to rip one's head open and see his face. Oh, yeah.
It really is like you're murking Bar Bar in his entire family. It's very traumatic. Elephants in pop culture have always been kind.
It's Dumbo or Bar Bar. Name a malicious elephant.
Yeah, I can't think of one. In real life as well, they seem pretty sweet. You see an elephant baby having a good time, and you're like, isn't it a shame we hunted these things for ivory because we're animals ourselves?
That's how I feel about elephants. I guess Kratos will just crack this elephant guy's brain open. I'm not having the best time.
I don't hold it massively against the game, but I like elephants.
I think it definitely hurts it that this is the one where they've pushed so deep into whatever law they can get their hands on.
I never thought I'd have to write in my notes Hecatonchires, which is the opening monster, a beast with many hands and many heads that gets reanimated. You fight through one of the typical God of War opening sequences. It's okay.
It's a little bit murky and technically quite rough. Though I should say the only way I could play this was by streaming it on PlayStation Now from PlayStation 3, because I don't own it on PlayStation 3. I'm not getting my PlayStation 3 out ever again.
I simply refuse. That's bullshit. I shouldn't have to do that.
I had to stream a game which already had performance issues. Very, very hard going.
I did play this natively on PS3. It does have some weird technical issues about it. You can see why this wasn't salvaged to be ported to PS4 like God of War 3 was.
Even though they're technically of a similar level.
I would play a 60 frame version of this. It has got some really impressive stuff. That snake bit is very, very long.
But I think there's a bit where you ride a snake and you're fighting loads of enemies as it goes through this ice cavern. And there's all this ice in the foreground that you're looking through to see the battle. Even on my stream, which at that point there was so much going on that it was rendered as four giant blue pixels.
Even I could tell it looked kind of impressive.
Yeah, amazing. What a great way to experience this game. I agree with you.
It should probably just be salvaged for posterity to be honest. All these games should. They're all a bit tied to the PS3 and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
These original ones.
Do it like the Mass Effect collection they did a couple of years ago. They should just go, here's all the God of Wars, just so you can always play them on PS5. Here they are.
Sell fucking loads, that would. That would be huge. I don't think they're just a bit too embarrassed about the sex minigames to just bring them back and remind everyone.
It's like, oh yeah, remember the cherub? Do you know what I mean? I'll tell you what else sucks about this.
They introduce a visually impressive, basically time travel control sort of tool, where you can basically move time forwards or backwards using an analog stick. You'd use this to solve, I would say, two to three puzzles in the game max. Nothing that elaborate.
That is just a showy addition that does very little for it. It's just not exciting enough as a USP. And this game smacks of, we need to reinvent this, basically.
And it really is that. And when you watch the Raising Kratos documentary, they do use this. They do kick this game a little bit.
Not the talented devs at the studio, but they very much use it as always. If they lost their touch, it's God of War kind of over, and they use this game to illustrate why. You can see why.
It's definitely as also ran as a game in this series gets. It's the only seven. From here, it's eights upwards, in my opinion, Matthew.
So yeah, we said we picked the definitive Kratos moment. Is it the four big blue pixels, Matthew, that did it for you?
I was actually going to say, you fight these conjoined twins called Castor and Pollux, and the boss fight itself is alright, but one of them is a big giant dude, and I think it's Pollux is like this shriveled half-man growing out of his side. It's not a very sympathetic depiction of conjoined people. And once you've killed the big one, you chop the small one off, and then you fall down this massive hole, and the small one is crawling away from you very slowly, and you just walk up and activate a quick time event to stamp it to death.
And I think him stamping a small with a Pollux is a classic, like, this Kratos being a dick move, but this thing is dying, like, the amount of blood loss anyways, like, that thing's not going anywhere. So, yeah, that's my Kratos moment.
Yeah, that's good. I wrote down, uh, moving those big snakes around.
Yeah, I mean, the snakes are visually impressive. It's just, you have to do three of them. Oh, it's so long that bit.
Fucking boring, that whole section. Yeah, I like, also, my brain sort of erased all knowledge of this game the second I completed it. I was like, yep, that was, like, firmly, like, the worst one, so, uh...
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. Moving on, then, to our number six. This is an interesting one to debate, Matthew, because we've kind of got, uh, it's kind of obvious the PSP ones aren't going to be at the top of the list, but I've got Ghost of Sparta here, and this is the second one that Ready of Dawn made in 2010, uh, after God of War 3 had released.
Um, it's a little bit longer, and arguably a bit more complete feeling as a God of War game. It came right at the end of my run of playing these, and so I felt like it was punished a bit by, maybe by repetition, but I think the thing that I hold against this is that it spends the whole game sort of like teasing out the idea of meeting Kratos' brother, and when you do meet him, you fight together for, like, about five minutes, and then he dies, and it's like... I shouldn't say spoilers for these games throughout these bits, but D-Master's your brother, and, like, it was interesting because when they meet and they're interacting, I'm like, oh, actually, like, something they hadn't really done with these games is the idea of a second playable character, much as obviously God of War 2018 would do, but, like, the idea for someone, for Kratos to riff off of, to have a relationship with, to shed some light on the character, that is kind of interesting, but you get so little of it here, and so I thought this was a little bit, again, a little bit also Ragnarök compared to some of the others.
What do you think of all that?
Yeah, I mean, I think I prefer this one a little bit to Chains of Olympus. I think they're much of a muches, they're very similar, but, like, this is just that thing I was talking about, like, the slightly more confident second go. Like, I think this has got slightly more memorable set pieces, but, I mean, it's really, really close.
My really hot take for a while was, like, are the PSP ones now better than God of War 1, which I don't think holds up. But as a take, I don't think that holds up.
It's a valiant effort, a bullshit take, you know.
Yeah, I mean, yeah. But, so the weird thing, not to take both these games together, we can talk about them separately, but, like, it is a weird match for PSP, you know. I think half the time you're thinking, wow, this is so impressive, like, how much of a full God of War experience this is.
But there is part of you also thinking, like, this is an epic, and I'm playing it on a screen the size of a postage stamp, and, like, am I marvelling at the ingenuity of it, rather than the kind of, the need for this thing to exist? Because it is, like, compromised in many ways, compared to the main games. Yeah, I think it just depends, like, where you play this.
I think if you were to play these two, before you got into the other games, like, they may, you may read them differently.
Yeah, I think that by the time Ghost of Sparta came around, critics were a bit less excited by the idea of having a full-fat God of War on PSP than they were with Chains of Olympus, where I think Chains of Olympus got to be, like, a nice, a really nice stopgap between, you know, God of War 2 and 3, whereas this came after 3, so it didn't really have that same purpose. It was kind of like, well, here's some more God of War if you want it, but you've now played the most technically impressive God of War of, you know, six months earlier, and here's another one.
Yeah. Yeah, that's tough. That's like a...
Yeah, that's bad luck for Ghost of Sparta, I think.
Yeah.
It's got a couple of things I really like. It's got a thing where, instead of like a rage mode, you can kind of ignite the blades and they're fiery, and when they're fiery, there's lots of metal enemies who you kind of heat up and sort of shear pieces off. You fight some automatons in this game who are like little mini versions of the Colossus of Rhodes, which I actually think is quite fun.
There's an enemy type. I guess it's quite similar to how the fists function in God of War 3, where you kind of like... There's certain enemies who are only susceptible to these particular attacks.
But I quite like that as a wrinkle for the combat. You're right about the undercooked nature of the Deimos cameo. But I do quite like the last fight where he's running around and you're telling him to throw a spear.
Interestingly, at this point, Corey Barlog had... I don't know if he was returning to the studio or just working with the studio, but he did write the story for this one. So I wonder if there's a hint of him showing...
That's what I was saying about him having slightly bigger aspirations for the character in this period, and he's toying with the idea of, oh, look, him and someone else working together to tag team the boss. It would be too generous to call The Last Boss Fight this game a prototype for 2018. But there's a hint of it in there somewhere.
Yeah, but then I just think, why not do the whole game with Demos and Kratos?
But then it shouldn't be on PSP, should it? That's probably just too much for it. It also has a proper interactive, like Uncharted 2, Pet the Ox moment, where you get to walk around, you go back to Sparta and you walk around a town.
Oh yeah, that's quite weird that bit.
Yeah, there's nothing else like it in any of the other ones, where you walk around and everyone's like, yeah, Kratos, that's where the sex mini game is, because all the women are like, you're back, come in here and have sex with every woman in the town. But it is, the whole time you are just like, and it lasts like maybe a minute and a half, the whole thing, and it's like, it feels like a not very good version of what Naughty Dog were kind of playing around with.
Yeah, it definitely feels compromised compared to that. One thing I thought that Ready at Dawn did really well, actually, is in giving Kratos an armory that was a little bit different from the main games. And here you get the spear and shield, which I think is quite nice.
That feels a little bit different to everything else that you get in these games. That's cool. You've got like the Blades of Athena, I think.
So they feel slightly different, not massively, but just a little bit different. And so, yeah, that combined with the fire attack, like you say, means that you do have slightly different feel to the armory. But yeah, I think it's just that compromised nature of how they weave in the brother and Kratos' family history, because you have his mother in this game as well, which that's a weird bit as well.
Yeah, so it doesn't really successfully shed any more light on the character, which I thought was a little bit of a shame. That's why I've punished it by moving it down here.
Yeah, that's... Listen, I'm not going to, you know... This is going to trigger a lifelong quest of revenge against you if you do this, so it's fine.
No, that's it. You won't... Yeah, we won't move to an Irish island and you won't speak to me in the pub for many, many hours.
I'm determined to ride that joke into the ground, Matthew. Okay, so what's the big Kratos moment from this? So I've put sinking Atlantis lol because Kratos does basically just sort of like sink an entire city without really giving a shit, which is quite baller and ridiculous.
And that's why Poseidon's mad at him in God of War 3. Is that what you had to...?
That is good. I was going to say like his classic dick move is throwing King Midas into a waterfall of lava to turn it into gold so that he can safely climb up it. Like that is like...
That's what I want from God of War, where you take a myth and you're like, what does this dude do? He turns things into gold with his magic hand. Fantastic.
Here's a bit of gear gating. Chuck him into that waterfall. And he's sticking out of it like, ahhh, because he's burning at the same time.
That's problem-solving, Kratos style.
Yeah. Is this also the one where there's a big dude who's... I think he's near some lava at one point and he's yelling at you, go, don't do that, no, stop doing that, you.
I think he's in this one. I think he's near some lava yelling at you. And then later on you just kill him, of course.
Oh, is that... I think that's not Prometheus, is it?
No, because Prometheus in God of War 2, you...
2, oh, that's right, yeah.
I can't remember, but there's just a dude yelling at you and he's just sort of telling you off like, yeah, you're a kid who's sort of like got on the grass and the ball and you're not supposed to be there. And it's like, this dude's bad news, my man, I'd get out of the way for you.
But like, that's God of War 101, it's like, even raising your voice to Kratos is like invitation for him to just absolutely brutalise you. Just keep your head down, don't make eye contact, that's the way to get through these games.
The Atlanteans get it, they're just like, even though their city's been sunk, they just run away politely and try and stay out of his way. I will say actually, the bit where Atlantis is sinking and you're on a boat that's swirling around the sort of sinking city is quite bad in this. Like I died halfway through and it felt like interminable sitting through the rest of it.
Again, that was like hard work. It was like a really bad version of that good set piece in God of War 2018 when you're on the flying ship and you try to get all the enemies off of it. It was like the bad version of that.
So yeah, here it is at number six. Sinking Atlantis, lol. That is just ridiculous.
It's almost bolted onto this story. It's like, oh, and by the way, I've sunk Atlantis.
Apparently, that was meant to be a set piece in God of War 2.
Yeah, like they designed a whole level for it. Yeah, to ditch it. Interesting.
Yes. Okay. Number five, then, Matthew, is God of War Changes of Olympus on PSP.
Quite predictable sort of placement here. So here's the reason I put this higher, right? This is, in all these games, right, they have basically a similar kind of like broad feeling big action.
But this is the only one that had a parry attack that I actually liked in the whole series.
Right.
Because you get the sun shield thing. It basically builds parrying into the combat system in a way that I feel like the other games didn't really. They all have like some kind of parry option.
But here, it makes that kind of little pause and the counter attack feel meaningful because they're like, this is one of your main weapons, this shield thing. Just make sure you do press this button at the right time to parry. And like, I think that works better than any similar system in the game.
So I really like that about it. But the real reason I'm putting it here, Matthew, is I think that my own personal experience of like, the PSP comes out and you have a lot of like, games that try and mimic the PlayStation 2 experience on a handheld and don't quite get there. This got there in a way that I don't think any other series did other than maybe GTA with the Liberty City Stories Vice City Stories game.
And like, to see this on a handheld in like, 2008 was just fucking amazing. It felt like someone had done something spectacular. It's a bit out of time as a kind of like, a five-hour game you play on a handheld and then you probably wouldn't replay for 25 quid.
Maybe that's a little bit strange by today's standards, but I really loved it and I also thought that the opening to this just kind of like really does have the big God of War epic sweep to it. So yeah, I thought it was just really, really competent. Plus, we'll get into this, but because this focuses on Kratos' relationship with his daughter and the idea of what he would he do to get her back, I think it does shed slightly more light on the character than some of the other games would.
I think Reddit Dawn had a good understanding of him. But what do you think, Matthew Castle?
Yeah, I think that's all fair. I feel like you definitely see less stuff in this one than you do in Ghost of Sparta. It's also very, it's got very similar plot to, I want to say God of War 3.
Well, God of War 3 is the one where you're just climbing up Olympus, killing the gods.
Or maybe it's just the original God of War. It's a proper, like, Hell on Back again story, which, you know, they do, unless I'm thinking of something, unless I'm muddling this up, you definitely go down to Hell and back up again. I just feel like it covers a lot of the beats that we'd seen in other God of War games, I guess is what I'm saying.
But, yeah, I mean, it does it well. Like, there's a couple of really good little set pieces I've mentioned. There's some stuff when you are down in...
I don't know if it's Hell or just the bowels of the Earth, because this is kind of a story about... It involves Atlas, so basically how Atlas comes to kind of carry the Earth on his shoulders is because he gets fucked up by Kratos in the last boss fight. It's the truth story, apparently.
And in this sort of fiery area where Atlas and the Titans are, which I don't know if that is just the Underworld, because all these games have such a visually different version of the Underworld, it's quite confusing, like where you are sometimes. It has, like, you sort of move around on these giant cogs that you kind of wind, and then they sort of, you push these sort of rotating levers, and then these cogs kind of move along these huge grooves, and you're trying to kind of fight enemies as they jump onto these cogs, which is quite kind of dramatic scene, that's quite a good sort of epic moment.
You get to fight Karen, the boatman, on the ferry of the damned. Oh yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah, that's quite good, as a bit of like, that's like a good myth they could sort of dip into.
Do we want to talk about the Elysium stuff with Calliope?
Yeah, we should. I will say, one note I would add to the combat side of things, Matthew, is the Gauntlet of Siget, and this is pretty cool, I think that's like, because you get all these enemies who have this stone kind of armour that you have to break off, I think it's another way they're able to add a little twist to it.
I think that does that before God of War 3 does the boxing glove weapon as well.
Yeah, so it's very similar, but I do think it works nicely.
Yeah, it's good.
So yeah, Calliope. Is this where you dunk on the QTE, Matthew?
Well, I will say part of this is you have to go to Elysium and to enter, you're basically stripped of all your weapons, health and magic. So it kind of has a character reset, which a lot of these games have, but quite far into the game and it feels like you're making a sacrifice to see your daughter again in Greek heaven, as it were. But when you're there, you realize you have to, you can't stay there, you know, like what the baddies of the game are going to do is going to actually end up destroying Elysium itself.
So you have to leave your daughter behind to go and kick some ass. But this is represented in one of the most preposterous quick time events of all time, where you mash the circle to push your daughter away while she tries to cling on to your leg. But like the animation style, it's that thing where like as you're pressing the button, you see the animation playing out.
So it's got a very similar energy to driving a dagger into a Minotaur's mouth, except it is a very small child that you're sort of wrestling away and she sort of comes back and then you wrestle away. And it's just an incredibly on-the-nose bit of like narrative design, I guess.
Right. I'm zagging on this. I think this is in the context of God of War, where every interaction you have, what Kratos has with like the larger story of the game involves QTEs, and that's the language of the game.
This, by comparison, is relatively subversive, like for the very moment it was in. Like, this is, you know, these are not, this is not the era of really sophisticated storytelling in all blockbusters that would become, you know, expected with these games. I think that this, in the context of God of War with all its QTEs, Kratos pushing his daughter away is not that bad.
That's what I think. That's me zagging at you.
It made me like, you know, a minor bark of laughter. Like, this is so dumb, you know? Like, this QTE man, this is how he interacts with everything in this world.
It sort of reminded me of something that, like, David Cage might do. It's got a little bit of Press X to Jason energy.
But the problem with Press X to Jason, right, is that is basically shorthand for I'm dunking on this without critically engaging with it. Like, that's my problem with Press X to Jason is like a criticism.
But Press X to Jason comes from someone who thinks I can find an interactive way of showing this moment of, like, parental panic. And the way I've shown it is in this very kind of reduced form of you press X to shout your child's name. That's why I say it has a similar energy.
It's someone trying to kind of encapsulate this huge emotional beat in something which is like a button mashing thing. Like, it just seems odd to me. But what I will say for it, that aside, like, I don't think it's bad.
I just think it's daft. OK, I'm not like, fuck this game because of this.
I don't contest that it's a little bit. I don't contest that it's on the nose.
I don't contest that. It's the way it moves, like his executions. It's just that's funny to me.
But what I do like is that given this series is all about like the trauma of this act of killing your loved ones, I've always had a problem that the actual event itself is never really in the game. Like it's in the cut scene. It's like someone told you, like, you know, it's like God of War 1 starts and it's like someone's like, by the way, the reason all this is happening is because you were tricked into kind of killing your family.
And like that seems like too bigger thing to just stick in a cut scene when it is literally the reason he does everything in like these six games is because of that. And at least this is a moment which attempts to like reckon with it and show you like, well, here's a relationship, because I don't know who these people are to him. You know, they're really unknowable, which makes it quite hard to like buy in to the character and what he's about.
Yeah. So on that front, like the idea of, oh, you get to meet her and then you push her away again, like, yeah, okay. It's just a bit of silly.
It is quite funny.
I don't contest that it's silly, but I do think that that context is just good to keep in mind, I think. It's like they would do it all right, given the time. They would do it okay, you know?
And this predates Heavy Rain by like two years as well.
David Cage probably played this and was like, actually, that's quite powerful. That should be my whole deal from now on.
Oh, wow. Dunking on David Cage. What a fucking left field thing to do.
I just don't think it's like, I just don't think it has that much value. It's been done so much. Do you know what I mean?
It's like, we've been there. We've done that. Like, I don't know.
Who's still upset about Press X to Jason in 2022?
I'm not upset about it. I think you're silly. That's what I'm saying.
Well, that's fair. It's like, I think it probably is the right comparison to make, but it's just like, yeah, I do just remember that moment landing a bit better at the time than it does now.
This is Colin Farrell going, Why aren't you friends with me anymore? I'm not going to read them anymore, I'm bringing Leeson saying, You just dunked on David Cage too many times.
We flipped roles, because I thought I was the Colin Farrell person, so you are the very perturbed person.
You were the very perturbed Brendan Gleeson type being bothered about podcast stuff. I'm the one who's annoyed you with my David Cage, with my cliched David Cage.
At least lay into the racial politics of Detroit, become human, Matthew. I mean, geez, update your David Cage.
I know, I'm so sorry.
No, it's fine. It's all good, my friend. Good.
I think that most people probably say Ghost of Sparta is the more complete feeling game. But I just think the Demos thing being half-arsed as it was, is the reason it has to be a bit lower because I just don't think the execution overall is as good. Also, I do like that in Elysium you basically just have to kill all those pure souls to get your stuff back.
Oh yeah.
That's quite bleak.
Is that the Kratos moment?
Oh yeah, I suppose it probably is. I mean, that or the pushing his daughter QTE, which has to be one of those really. Or the Candle, of course, the best sex minigame.
Yeah, that's the funniest sex game by far.
Yeah, it's the one that is the cheekiest and the least offensive probably. God, it feels dumb to be defending those minigames in 2022. What am I doing with my life?
Okay, number four is the original God of War, 2005. So as mentioned, I think that what is really impressive about this game is how complete it all feels from the off. So it sets the template of, you have the massive set piece to start off with in the Hydra.
It gives you the weapons and magic power set you would largely use throughout all of the other games. It doesn't deviate massively from what's here. Everything that would follow is just polish.
This has a really boring bit in a desert that I don't like. It is a bit more languid. I think, generally speaking, it's just slightly rough around the edges than the sequels would be, which is to be expected, but still a fantastic game.
And I would say far more complete as a vision of what the series would be than, say, the original Uncharted was when that came out. And still really good fun, really fast-moving, enjoyable. It's all here.
Everything that all these other games would do is here. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I think memories of this game can get a little bit screwy because you remember it. Like, it only has three boss fights, which is quite odd. But you think, oh yeah, this is a game where there's a boss every hour, but it's not.
It's just the Hydra and then the weird Minotaur thing and then Ares at the end. I'd say they're all quite good fun. And they've all got a spectacular ending to them.
Yeah, I think you're right about the bit in the desert. I don't love it. I do quite like the bit where having done all that, you sort of do a dungeon on Kronos' back and then you leave and then Ares kind of kills you and then you're down to hell and you have to kind of fight your way back up again.
As a kind of plot development, I think, dying and having to escape from hell is quite good fun.
Kronos looks amazing as well for like a PS2.
Oh yeah, like the way it captures, like when you're kind of like shimmying around it and like the camera, you can see like this huge titan like way below you and like obviously it's setting up stuff which then gets paid off in three as well in terms of some of these characters, you get to come back some of these locations which is really cool. It has got some absolutely rank platforming which I think they ironed out or they basically agreed not to do like escaping from hell like literally feels like escaping from hell at times. There's always like spinning meat poles covered in spikes and there's lots of treading carefully along those and if like you get tapped once by a spike, you fall to your death and the checkpointing is a bit rough.
I remember that being like a real like I almost almost kind of gave up on this and sort of fell out of love with it and I don't think any of the subsequent games ever have like individual sections that are as rough as that. I think they become a bit more focused on like we want you to see this through to completion. Like this is actually quite a hard game I'd say compared to the others.
Yeah, I think the other thing I would kind of like level at this is that like I do think that when you fight Ares at the end and become giant, Ares looks quite daft in this, I think, rather than scary. It sort of like looks a bit like a Buffy Monster of the Week rather than a scary sort of like God. A bit like, yeah, we've stuck some tendrils on a guy who was in CSI last week kind of energy to it.
And then stuck a ginger beard on him. It just doesn't entirely convince. But I do also agree with you that by not showing like the core moment that drives Kratos, by showing it all in like pre-rendered cutscene basically, it does diminish it slightly.
You just kind of wish you could see it in this game. But I suppose like the kind of Pat the Ox thing was still years away, right? Like that was probably the established way to do this kind of storytelling unless you're like Hideo Kojima at the time.
Yeah, but then it has that little bit at the end where you kind of, you defeat Ares and then there's almost like a little kind of epilogue where you become the God of War. That's playable, right? I remember that being playable.
You like walk up the steps to the temple and then you go in and it's like all the things you've killed in the game and then you ascend the throne like in an interactive manner.
I believe so, yeah.
Yeah, but that's how I remember it. If it's a cutscene, then my God, my memory is bad. But, you know, I think this series has definitely, like, even from the off, attempted to show you moments which other people would have consigned to a cutscene, so that they didn't show you this key moment, you know.
Even just having him, like, walk up to a house and open the door and find his dead family or whatever, or something, just to be like, oh, okay, I get it. It's a little bit confusing. But, yeah, the ending, I think, is quite unusual in that you kind of, you know, you get what you want.
You kill Ares, but then you become the God of War. And it has this sort of very strange epilogue where it sort of shows you sitting there on this throne with, like, war through, like, all the centuries playing out, like, up to, like, modern warfare footage. And it's kind of, like, not the game Modern Warfare as in the era of Modern Warfare.
And, you know, it's sort of saying, you know, your thirst for revenge is taken to this place where this, you know, you become such a vicious bastard that you then inspired, you know, thousands of years of mankind, you know, hurting mankind. And it's, like, quite an impressively epically bleak conclusion to a game.
Yeah. I mean, confession time. This is the only one I didn't replay for this episode.
Right.
Just because I played it, I thought, like, oh, I completed this in 2012 with a HD collection. There's no need for me to replay this one. But my memories are not amazing, so I did have to scroll through them.
Yeah, I replayed it before 2018 came out, so... Yeah, it's a little bit fresher. But, you know, I kind of like that kind of confidence, you know, that it has this slightly kind of grander vision.
And the fact that you do end as a god puts them in an interesting place for, like, the sequel and how they treat that, which, you know, we'll get onto in a moment.
Basically, in every sequel, you have to get betrayed by the person who was quite nice to you at the end of the last one. Like, that's basically, like, that's, like, what happens, essentially, in each of these games. So, yeah, I do agree.
It's kind of like the status quo is kind of, like, completely reset, basically. It's like, oh, it's completely shifted, rather. So, but, yeah, still, like, just think that, still mechanically, it just had everything the series would need right here.
And, you know, you've got to remember, like, it basically invents a huge cast of enemy characters who are basically the enemies for the whole series. They don't add. No, not really.
And they killed in exactly the same way. Like, this is, you know, you're mashing that circle button to kill Minotaurs from the off, you know? So that's quite, you know, in terms of just it arriving, like, quite fully formed, definitely in the combat style, you know, that's pretty impressive that it kind of knew what it was doing.
Enough that they didn't really feel the need to, like, take a major hammer to it ever, really.
Yeah, for sure. All they would kind of do is give most the enemy types a facelift between games.
Maybe more explicit breasts.
Yeah, like, what if we put breasts on this snake thing?
What about this elephant had breasts? You're like, oh, I don't know about that.
OK, so what's the moment for this one? I think it has to be the Hydra, Matthew, because, like, all of the games right up to 2018 would start with a big set piece, and, like, that template, it debuts here. It's like you fight a giant sea monster at sea, and, you know, they would all try and live up to this moment.
So I think that as a kind of out of the gates kind of like confidence of what this world is, what you're doing here, what your role in it is, it's like just, it kind of defines Kratos in front of you, basically. He's the guy who can fucking mess up a Hydra. Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's the classic moment. The fun of it being in one of those boss arenas and you can sort of see how it's going to play out but there's still fun in seeing it play out. Like if there's ever an exposed spike in any of these places, that spike is either getting pushed through or someone's getting pulled onto it, always.
That's like, Kratos loves, loves pulling people onto a big spike.
Definitely, or using a big enemy's weapon against them. Oh yeah, definitely. Don't be carrying a hammer around with this guys around.
Yeah, so that is our killer Kratos moment. Honorable mention to the death of his wife and child.
It's a cutscene.
Well, it does also, I think that that does, that is a useful origin in the sense that all of the violence that would be throughout these games, like the violent tone of the series generally is set. You know, it's set by that basically, isn't it? That's like, you know, it starts as grim as it gets, even if you don't see it in-engine.
And then, yeah, it goes from there. Cool. Okay, number three then.
This is, this might be controversial, Matthew, because I think a lot of people consider this the best of the PS2 games. I really like it, but God of War 2 is going here. I think that this, by comparison to the first one, is better paced, has more bosses, has more variety, introduces the Pegasus, introduces an Icarus who's dealing with mental illness, so you kill him and take his wings, because why not?
Slap a load of Greek lads around to give you a bit of sass. Very WWE energy to those Greek lads, you find this one. And like, has some, I would say leans more into the moments of just outright nastiness than the first one does, like a bit more confidence in what that tone is maybe.
And takes you to more places, like just a variety of like, you know, just going to the edge of the earth basically, and then like, you know, riding these giant horses and on this kind of chariot. And it just like, it just shows you so much this. It just feels like it sets the template much wider in terms of what they're showing you of this depiction of ancient Greece.
Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I'm in complete agreement. It's just a much more confident game, much better idea of what they want to do with it. I think the fun they have with the Greek myths in this is just wild.
Yeah, like the stuff with Icarus. You fight Perseus, Theseus. Yeah, the Sisters of Fate.
Zeus himself. And there's always an interesting gameplay twist, whether that's flying Pegasus through the skies for a little aerial combat, or some mad puzzle or some huge visual set piece. The Colossus of Rhodes, absolutely amazing opening to this game.
It's just classic, bigger and better sequel making. Then there's quite a fun thing in this about... The whole idea of it is that you're trying to change your fate, which is why you go to the Sisters of Fate to give yourself a better fighting chance against Zeus, so you don't get dicked over by Zeus.
It's basically the idea. Which does raise the idea, why doesn't he just go back? If he can alter time, why doesn't he just go back and un-write all the horrors of his life and get his daughter and wife back?
But anyway, putting that aside. But the story is quite, what I remember of it, is quite well defined by you're going to this place called the Island of Creation, which is where all this fate business can be done, and everyone there is also out to change their lot. You're meeting other Greek myths.
Persis is there to try and rewrite his history. Icarus is there to try and rewrite his history. There's all these people who are basically all these desperate Greek myths meeting in one place for Kratos to chew through.
I think that's quite fun.
Yeah, for sure. What happens to Prometheus in this is quite grim as well. It's like he just killed me out of pity and then he just burns alive.
And you're like, yep, well done, everyone.
Everyone gets it. There's quite a weird emotional note in this game where at the start, you're fighting with all the Spartans and they all get dicked over. And there's this lone Spartan who kind of survives.
He's meant to be your mate and gets sent off home. And then much later in the game, you have a fight in this darkened room in 2D. You fight this shadowy figure and it sort of switches to a 2D perspective.
And you fight and kill this figure and it's revealed it was this Spartan from the start who's come to the island to try and rewrite the battle so that all his friends don't die. And you've killed the only person you've forgiven, which I kind of raise because there's a note in 2018 where he says Atreus is named after one of his Spartan friends who sacrificed. And I always wondered if it was that guy, like, because as you know, God of War 2 is also a Cory Barlog game.
If that's like a little nod to that. But it just has I just think it's a little bit more going on. There's a little bit more kind of interrogation of like myths and character in this game.
I think so as well. I think that like the what I associate as the sort of overall story world identity of God of War is is set by this game more than the first one, I think, because because it's like because use is at the center of the story. It feels grander and because you start as the God of War and you are depowered because you are basically seen as this threat to support too much war to the world.
But more in a wider sense, you are kind of seen as like the plaything of the gods. They have all the power and fuck you. That's like how the gods made in this whole series.
So the idea that it is use and that there is this like quite interesting time travel element to it, to the to the story. I like I really like that. Yeah, so yeah, just just much more kind of comprehensive as a depiction of this world.
Really fantastic. I think that the Colossus of Rhodes set piece is like one of the like two or three top moments of the whole like this entire era of God of War as well. Like I love a boss that you actually go inside as well as fight it on the outside.
Yeah, that's fucking rad. Yeah. Yeah, they add the Icarus wings to make platforming a little bit less painful, Matthew.
I think they added some new movement options when you were climbing as well to make that a bit more fun.
Yeah, this adds the grapple hook as well. So like, yeah, swinging is well, it just gives them like a bigger canvas for like the big set pieces because you can swing around the outside of like giant things. And that's always welcome.
Yeah, with my like declining eyesight, there was definitely a sense of like, I don't really fucking know what I'm swinging to next with some of these set pieces because sometimes craters are so tiny on the screen. Yeah, so there's a little bit of that, but that's just I should just go to spec savers and get that sorted out. Yeah, that's on me, not the game.
That's on you. That's not on Corey.
Yeah, so I really love this game. But I do prefer another game in this in this era, which we'll get to. So Matthew, what's the killer Kratos moment from this?
I'm picking forcing the scholar to read the book so Kratos can get the Sisters of Fate because you basically this is a really good example of like what God of War 3 would do more, which is fundamentally an innocent person has to translate this text so you can get in to you can get your own way. And he mashes this old man's head against this like stone tablet, essentially, until his like blood just like, yeah, just rinses into the into the ground and gets into where he needs to go. And he has no regard at all for like the life he's taken.
But there's also a bit where he's like grabbing the dude's head and shouting read, which is really funny as a kind of like Kratos moment.
Yeah.
So I've picked that because I think like that's that's a particularly nasty bit of of Kratos behavior. But I suppose you could also pick Prometheus burning alive. Yeah, that's good.
I quite like the end of the boss fight against Theseus, where he just slam his head in the door over and over again till it gets pulped into basically dog food. That's that's quite a classic Kratos bit of pettiness. Like he just never stops when he should.
I really like the boss fight against Perseus in this who kind of arrives with his own mystical sort of tools. Perseus almost feels like he could have been the star of his own game and he's kind of running into Kratos exactly the wrong time. He's got like a cloak invisibility, a magic reflecting shield and like a magic sword.
It feels like he's been collecting the parts of his quest and then you run into him in a boss fight and you basically strip him of them one by one. He starts off and he's invisible. You need to look for his footsteps in the water to attack him and you're kind of stripping him of his tools and you end up to stick him on a spike, which isn't like the most violent thing Kratos does.
But it's the fact that he takes this just very noble hero of myth, kind of completely deconstructs him and then just murders him. And it's kind of like, you know, my myth is better than your myth. I just like the pitch of that.
Yeah, there's definitely a feeling of him trampling over established mythology. That's kind of like what he's about, isn't it? That's really funny.
That's good reading, Matthew. I like that. Yeah, he's a bit too much of a wet blanket and the pussies and this, I think, to get.
Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, like, I think they tread quite a fine line of you can never ever like who he brutalizes or it just wouldn't work. You know, they have to keep them inhuman a little bit or it becomes quite sour.
And I think they do it. I can't think of any time they really dropped the ball on that.
Yeah, I don't think I don't really fancy Paseo's chances anyway against the very gross looking Medusa with big sagging gray breasts and this.
Yeah, that ain't great.
Yeah, not the not the best hang that the picture Medusa. So, yeah, I really love this game, but I do prefer our number two, which is God of War 3, Matthew. So you agree with me on this one that three is better than two?
Just like it's like on a shallow level, it's just so much shinier and the PS4 remaster is just a thing of beauty. It looks so fucking good. I mean, it's unfair to kind of compare the two really.
But I also I just think that the the story structure of this of you have to get to the top of Olympus to kill Zeus is just so clear. It's so pure. And even though you go up and down the mountain and we can get to that, like it's got this amazing drive and you are just churning gods every step of the way.
And it just feels like the best version of like Kratos is this angry god killing machine just constantly moving forwards. I think this is the one which really nails it.
I couldn't have said it better myself. That's that's what I love about it, too. It's that structure of there is use at the top of this fucking mountain.
Get to the top of the fucking mountain. That's like the entire game is just that.
Yeah.
There's another layer of something that I loved this game that is both like I think a major strength and also a pointed weakness in places, which is Aphrodite.
This is one of your boldest takes.
That was my rad Kratos moment. I'll save the after the end. It's like the fact that the tone is even darker and more desperate and nasty.
And like there is how do I put this? There is a creator's intent at work in how Kratos' drive to like kill the gods and get his revenge at the cost of everything is like it's not I don't think it's portrayed as a hero's quest here. Like he doesn't at the end he does make a kind of sacrifice.
But at that point he is basically cost the lives of every single person in ancient Greece. Like that is essentially what the story tells you. And like it makes it basically the slow build up of terrible things he does to different characters in this, whether it's, you know, who's that dude he fucking the inventory traps inside the fucking mechanical box.
That's Daedalus, that's Icarus' dad.
Yeah, who's like he misses his son who Kratos has killed. And his reward for helping Kratos is getting fucking squashed in his own big device. That's grim or ripped apart.
That's nasty too. Like folks who live on Olympus who just chuck, who's like on the way on like a little ledge he's climbing up. So he just fucking chucks them off to their death or ripping off Helios' head or ripping off the Hermes' feet so he can run faster.
Like, you know, this is all kind of set from the start with like how Poseidon is beaten to death in first person. Like it's just so much more brutal and nasty. And I'm not saying that's big or clever, right?
Because there are some nasty moments in this that I think definitely overstep the bounds of like good taste. But there's like something so singular about the level of violence and the tone. It just feels like there's such conviction and this is how we have to end this story.
It has to be as nasty as it can get. And it's like, I'd say it's like borderline too much for a game published by a company's biggest Sony. What do you think about that?
It has like this huge like mythological anger to it, which is why I think it gets away with it. Like it feels like that is of a piece with the nature of these stories, you know, like the kind of core mechanic of every time you kill a god, you're basically like stripping something from the world, which makes it worse for humanity. So when you kill Poseidon, the world floods and everyone drowns.
When you kill Helios, the sun goes out and plunges into darkness. And you are reminded, like every once in a while, you'll get to like a balcony and you get to look down on just how Earth is currently doing because of what you've done. Yeah, I love that.
It gets worse every time. Like you kill Kamuhu, who unleashes like, maybe it's Hera, who unleashes like the plague of locusts. And it's just, it's this idea of, but I think you're right.
It's so singular in like, this guy will stop at absolutely nothing. And occasionally it pauses to remind you of that. But for the most part, you're so kind of, you're having such a good time.
You're so kind of wrapped up in it that you kind of go along with it. That's what I'm talking about, like the amazing momentum. Like, there's very few sections of this game which, you know, maybe last longer than 10 minutes in terms of theme before it moves you on to like the next area or the next puzzle or the next enemy encounter.
It's like, you just get swept up with it. You don't really realize like what a complete mess you've made of things. So that's why I think it gets away with it.
But you're right, I just think it's so complete as an experience. Like the overall quest, like the chaos you're unleashing is just so beautifully piled up. I love all the, you know, I love the new version of the Hades.
You basically get, you know, it starts with this amazing set piece where the Titans are assaulting Olympus and you're climbing up and you think, oh, well, this is going to be it. We're just going to get to the top and nuke all the gods. But you get like mullered and sent back down to Hades and basically have to climb back up again.
But like the little even the trip down to hell, you know, you get to like, you know, off the Lord of the Underworld and free all the souls. And it has this like. I was trying to work out how the best way to describe it.
Like at times you think it's going to be like a Metroidvania because you keep seeing with stuff that you're not going to be able to like interact with into the combat with later weapons. But it's like an incredibly scripted Metroidvania. Like there is one path through this game, which they lead you on.
But it beautifully takes you like up and down this mountain in a way which doesn't feel like they're padding it out. Like everything you do makes sense at the given time. And it just adds up to this, you know, by the end when you finally get to the top, it kind of makes complete sense why you've taken every step.
You've revealed every secret, everything that kind of, you know, seemed a mystery earlier on is explained and justified. It's like a real triumph of world design, like how they constructed this thing that you would be able to move through it in the way you do without it feeling like backtracking. I think it's super smart, this game.
Yeah, I love it too. I think like the idea of, you know, you have your amazing opening and then you're chucked down to the underworld, that's like fantastic. And the underworld is as beautifully depicted as any part of Olympus is.
The bit where you're fighting Hades in the dark is amazing.
That's great. I was going to say losing all your powers in the River Styx, then getting stripped out by all the souls. That's a really cool like sort of depowering gimmick.
Yeah, I think that's what I love about this is it feels like, okay, this is the end of the story. Let's burn through every single bit of Greek mythology we've got left on the table. And I just really love that.
And I think that, you know, you do mention like how you kind of graze out over a cliff and stuff like that. I think those moments really land because you feel the vibe of the world around you changing as you climb this mountain. And that is and I think I just it just really is effective in making every step of the way it's like Kratos is not a good guy.
He's just like the gods are not good guys either. But, you know, anything that anything that gets in the way is going to die. To me, this has the most exciting narrative vision of any of these games.
Yeah, minus the 2018 one, which we'll discuss. But it's just like, I don't know, there's just such confidence and this is the way it has to be. And that's why I think it kind of justifies a lot of the tonal choices in the game, you know?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Like the other games, you know, I think there's meant to be moments of violence where you're like, wow, this is what revenge does to someone. But this is the only one where like it breaks the entire world and rubs it in your face.
Yeah, like what you've done is a terrible, terrible thing.
Yeah, it's like it kind of sets this very early as well where there's like a dude who's in a jail cell. Are you basically like burn him alive to get like a bow that you need? Like it's just...
Should we also talk about the pushing the woman into the cockpit, Matthew? Because this is like probably the most contentious bit of the whole series. It is gross and grim and like very sinister.
Like it's probably like the most, oh, Kratos is just a fucking bad dude bit of this game where you meet this basically like basically like a slave of Poseidon's, this princess who is topless and Kratos pushes into a cog to hold it still while he gets through a gate. And then she is smushed alive inside the cog. And like, it was the one of the first videos I watched of Anita Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency was this detail.
It used to have a really gross trophy as well to go along with it. Got rid of that for the PS4 one, which was wise. I think it is like an example of what I was talking about earlier, Matthew, where there is that tonal conflict maybe between we want to do something really mature and adult and also having very adolescent tendencies.
I think that this is where the one bit where it falls afoul. But I can't deny that it does represent how women are treated throughout this series, for better or worse. What do you think?
Yeah, I think that particular one sticks out because there's no... It's not like you go to this cog and you're like, oh, I need a person to stick in this cog. You know, you rescue this person.
You see, when I was playing it, I'd so forgotten that that was the end of that. I'd so forgotten that that's what it was working towards. Because you just have to save this princess.
She's nice to you. You save her. It takes a couple of puzzles to save her.
And then you're scoring her out and you're fighting the enemies. And then it sort of makes it worse in that, like, the punchline is, oh yeah, she's like meat for this puzzle. And like it is, it is unpleasant.
It feels to me like a really misjudged joke. Where someone's like, isn't it funny that you go to all this effort to save this person and then they get crushed by this cog that they're too weak to hold up? And you're like, oh yeah, like I'm not saying I'm not defending it at all.
But like, you know, yeah, if anything like that made it worse. Because I just didn't, like I genuinely sort of didn't see it coming. Even like both times, I guess.
I think like what makes us innocent to me is like there's a prompt where Kratos will just go move. And he says it and it's really like he has an idea for what he's going to do with her.
It's weird because like getting her out of the cell has one of my favourite puzzles in the series, which is where you have to kick all these dogs through a portal to like, fill this like weight, this weight pad and like the idea of using this dog kicking ability in this puzzle solution is quite funny. But then like you say, it's just followed up by this very, very sour note.
Yeah, I felt, you know, I'm not saying like it's big or clever, like completely the tone basically. I wanted to like be well rounded in my, you know, appraisal of why I think this is a good game by pointing out the bit, the one bit where I think it's very compromised. That and the sex mini game, which is super naff and male gazey.
Yeah.
But yeah.
It's a bit odd as well. Like it, I think it's maybe at its weakest in the very final fifth, where there's, you're trying to save this character, Pandora, to open the box and like they sort of use her as this sort of like stand in for like Kratos' daughter. The idea is that she sort of humanises him a little bit.
He spends some time with her and then sort of makes a decision at the end of the game, you know, out of a bit more kindness. And I think you're meant to think, well, I saw it as implied that it's this kind of character sort of believing that there's sort of some good in him. And it's like that that feels like that that that character in that little relationship feels like a little it happens a little bit too late and it's a little bit unearned.
It's the bit of the story that doesn't really work for me.
I think that's fair for sure. That doesn't really like. Having only played like last month, it didn't really even leave an impression that whole sequence.
Yeah.
See, that doesn't totally work. But yeah, everything else about I really love this great perspective puzzle in this when you're in, is it Hera's Garden? I think it's Hera.
Yeah. That I really loved where you're trying to figure out how to like, it's basically like lining up these staircases to climb this big puzzle. That's really good.
In fact, I would say the scale of the puzzles generally this is like not loads of them, but the ones that are in a field gigantic and epic in a way that like the, you know, like the, like the, the action set pieces do, like the puzzles mimic it. Like the, the bits where you're kind of going around Daedalus is like labyrinth, basically, that's, that's really cool as a kind of bit of set PC puzzle design. I really like the bit.
Is it like the, it's like that, that tomb when you're in the underworld, Matthew, where you slam it into that thing to progress. That's pretty cool. And it's like, I think the dead body is someone you killed in Chain of Chains of Olympus at the end of that.
It's like Hades White or something.
Right.
Yeah, that's, that's pretty good. There's a bit where there's like three giant statues that you see at the start and you come back later on. And there's like, you can smash the back of their heads.
It's like little.
Yeah, that's what I mean. It's like even things which you think you're done with, they kind of script it so you get back to them and get to fuck them up. Like nothing survives in this game.
Yeah, that's, but that is, that is what is great about it. Fundamentally. That is what I love about it.
I finished God of War 2 in about two weeks. I finished God of War 3 in like three days. I just fucking plowed through it.
I thought it was so, so good.
I played this relatively recently before replaying it and I thought I'll just play the opening again just to see that cool set piece because the stuff with the titans and the mad kind of water horse that kind of comes out of it is just such a crazy looking thing and it just pulls you in. It's just, it's got, you know, it's some of like the best pacing in a game, like outside of like your classics, like, you know, your Resi 4s or whatever, you just, you just have to see it. It's so replayable, this game.
Yeah. Kronos, that boss fight looks fucking rad as well.
Oh, that's, yeah, that's great. It's just, yeah, you know, you think, oh, is the opening of this game going to be like the biggest set piece? And then it's like, well, here's another Titan and this time it's just you versus it.
And it starts off with Kronos crushing you between his thumb and finger and like, you know, you zoom from so far out right down to tiny little Kratos stuff between his thumb and finger. And then like, it's those kind of perspective shifts of what I may be missing in 2018, like just such huge swings that they can't possibly do due to the camera angle.
But yeah, so, so good, Matthew. Please you like this one as much as I do, because I think it's really holds up. Yeah.
In places you wouldn't, you could tell this is a 12 year old game necessarily from looking at it. Very pretty. So number one, Matthew, the very obvious Kratos moment, sorry.
Oh, yeah, sorry, gosh, I've kind of listed all the moments in the game, basically, like there's a whole game of Kratos moments, isn't it? It's tough to pick one, but I think like the like beating is used to death in first person, like seeing it from first person is such a great technique to use in this one. And then they would obviously reframe some of the events of this in God of War 2018.
I think I just love the sheer violence of those first person sequences. Hercules getting mugged, that's pretty, like he gets turned into dog food as well, Matthew. That's quite a fun little arena fight.
I like that. Gosh, I don't know. It's tough to pick one.
I think like in terms of like announcing its intent, I think pressing both analogue sticks in to push out someone's eyes is like a QTE for the ages.
Oh yes, Poseidon you do that too, right? Yeah. And like also those water horses that Poseidon has look fucking rad at the start as well.
Yeah.
That whole sequence, I think.
Yeah.
What about the eyes? Because he does about like 1900 fucking reprehensible things after that in a row, so it's easy to forget some of these. Okay, cool.
So number one then Matthew, God of War 2018. Not particularly sort of like kind of surprising take here. Now I remember you being mega pumped about this at the time.
So the kind of the whole thing with it, of course, they reset the story. Kratos survives the events of God of War 3. He does like plunge a blade into himself to kill himself fundamentally, but does manage to survive and crawl away from the wreckage of ancient Greece that he's left behind.
Finds his way to another another place that has different gods in it basically, and picks up with him in this living in the wilderness with with his son and his wife has recently deceased and it's about spreading her ashes at the very highest peak of this Norse mythological world they live in.
Good to continue the trend of like vital female characters dying off screen.
Yep, that's definitely a specialty here. So how did you feel about this one at the time, Matthew, were you totally sort of taken with it?
Yeah, when they first announced it, I was not concerned, but like, you know, there was this already the cliche of like all, you know, Sony are kind of making all their games similar. And I don't really know what it was based on thinking back to 2018. But you know, the kind of cliche was, or the argument was that, you know, they were just trying to make everything grown up and sophisticated, a la The Last of Us, as in like that was so critically acclaimed, we're going to make all our game heroes that.
And I felt a little bit of initial hesitation in terms of, well, you know, I don't think you should be ashamed of this character being sort of obnoxious and violent in his own thing. You know, I don't necessarily need to see that take on this character. I was also curious about how it was going to possibly do the action.
But like that was that was quite unfounded because it's a really, really sophisticated piece of character work, this journey to the top of the mountain where, you know, which explores this father son relationship and him coming to terms with, you know, a past he hasn't shared with his son, coming to terms with letting his son know who he is, coming to terms with the fact that he comes from this lineage where, you know, it doesn't end well for fathers and sons. You know, this, everyone kills their father in his family. So, you know, he's obviously got that kind of tension and I just thought it explored it in a really fantastic kind of sort of third person, almost, I mean, this is a lot more Metroidvania-y than the other games, you know, in terms of a good world that you'll keep digging deeper for secrets, but never lose sight of that central relationship thread that kind of holds it all together.
Yeah, for sure. So I did play this at the time and got to the elf realm, which is like, probably not even really the end of the first act of the game. It's like, you know, about halfway through the first act, really.
And then found that dark elf realm a bit too slow.
It's the worst bit in the game, I think. Yeah, it is.
It's a shame, because it looks very picturesque and it does have a very key story moment in it, right? Where he goes into the light and Atreus, your son, is left behind and he kind of goes through some stuff.
Yeah, and proves surprisingly combat ready, which it doesn't. What happens to that for the rest of the game, I wonder?
That is true. So that bit, I was a bit put off by that. I was like, I'm sort of like, I can take or leave the whole father and daughter, father and son thing.
Yes, I guess there is the kind of whorey thing of like, oh, people are older in the industry now, so they're not just making violent games, they're making, and this embodies that more than anything else. And at the time when they revealed this, because the Raising Kratos documentary shows how like it was revealed at E3 2016, and people were like, oh, my God, it's Kratos. He kind of steps out of the shadows.
And that was like a big moment, for sure. I think at the time, I was just there thinking, well, but what's the fucking swinging in Spider-Man? Like I was only preoccupied with that game.
I didn't really care about coming back. So that moment didn't really land for me. So it wasn't like a big deal to me either way.
They brought Kratos back. So yeah, but playing it this week, I was just so struck by how polished it is, how much dialogue there is, how much contextual dialogue there is, and how much effort is put into characterisation, how this world, which is not massive in terms of real estate, you don't go to like tons of places in this, because they depict the realms as like basically being laid on top of each other. So sometimes it's kind of reusing bits and pieces of, you know, sort of like in-game objects between different, when you travel to different realms, which is completely fine, of course.
I think that like that level of polish has almost broken people's brains, where their expectations are that like all blockbuster games are going to be like this now. I think a few of Sony's blockbusters have done this, but this feels like it took hundreds of people five years to make. It just feels like that kind of game, doesn't it?
I do love the depiction of Kratos because even though it does reckon with his past, it doesn't eliminate the violent part of his personality or his like, I would say necessarily his ability to enjoy that violence or see that violence as necessary. So I think that I really love. I also love that it connects the two God of War series together in a very explicit way, with one extremely good moment involving the retrieval of some like old weapons of Kratos, which is a fantastic moment in the game.
Just everything you could want really from a contemporary version of what God of War should be. How do you feel about the combat, Matthew? This is the part of the game I'm probably the least convinced by.
I think it's just okay, the combat.
I see. I really do love it. I think, in many ways, this game, more than any other AAA genre piece, feels like a more original version of something.
I actually felt at the time that doing that kind of overshoulder perspective, okay, we'd seen that a lot since Resident Evil 4, but doing it for a largely melee based combat system. And it really working as well, and it really did work for me. I thought, I've never actually seen something like this.
I thought it really did feel like a new idea. Like a lot of new ground had to be covered for this to work. And there was a big buzz of excitement for me as I was playing it, of like, oh wow, this feels like someone really trying out new stuff and experimenting with what doesn't work from this perspective.
Like how you have hectic encounters where people are all around you, but it's still manageable. How is second character factors in? Like, I don't think there is anything else quite like it.
So I really, really rate it on, you know, the beat to beat combat. And I think it unfolds in a really fun way. I think it develops with like new powers.
There's maybe one too many like bits of equipment you're toying within this. Like you spend maybe a little bit too much time in menus kind of leveling up individual pieces of like individual weapons for individual characters, which I could do without. But like the way it weaved special attacks in in terms of these runic powers and the weird sort of magics that Atreus brings into the fold, you know, it just it moves and looks like nothing else really, I genuinely thought it kind of like, you know, move the dial a little bit in terms of what people were doing in third person perspectives.
The depiction of it, I like that and how it feels in terms of animation and stuff, I've got no problem with. I think it's like, I think it's just a part of my brain that loves Sekiro and how precise that is, how right, how surgical that is.
It's like slow and heavy, instead of like quick and precise.
It is like quite Resi 4-ish as well, isn't it? In terms of like, I think the idea of like the staggering enemies and performing finishes and like the physicality of the third person combat.
You know, it's like crowd control, isn't it? It's a lot of like, if I take, you know, it's like threat detection, I'll tackle this, I'm in this arena. Like the way that it actually has quite a small number of like core enemy types that it that it relies on and then tries to just throw other wrinkles like, you know, you're fighting them.
But there's a dragon who's shooting down lightning. So you have to dodge that occasionally or you're fighting these enemies, you know, but you're really up against it time wise because you're on this lift that's going to collapse if you don't if you don't get everyone off it, whatever. You know, it's always kind of throwing little kind of curve balls in there.
Even so, I think it like, you know, you know, 30 hours if you do all the side content stuff. You know, one of the big flaws of this game is it does reuse a lot of enemy stuff and like, definitely like the mini boss game in this is very weak, like the endless trolls, the endless ancient stone robots, the those big ogre guys with the big rocks that they carry who die with the same execution quick time event every time. You know, that's where you feel some of the thinking of the old games doesn't really hold up like when you're that close up to the action and you can scrutinize it in such detail.
It just seems much more obvious when it's repeating itself than it seemed to in God of War, you know, one to three. Also, like, for all this game does well, I think it largely blows the boss fights, which are like a key ingredient of God of War. Like, I quite like The Dragon, even though it's just a very slow, easy puzzle fight, and I really like the cinematography and the concepts of the fights against the stranger, AKA.
Balder. You know, it doesn't do much, they're very easy fist fights, but they're framed in such an exciting way, that opening fight, which I put on my list of best boss fights in the boss episode, actually. Like, playing it again, I was like, oh, actually, this is really not a technically complicated fight, but what happens in terms of you getting punched through your house and then you push him into the mountain on a tree and, like, every time you hit him, he's, like, flying back through trees?
It feels like two gods having a fight, which is what I rate about it, but outside of that, I actually think the boss fights in this game are, like, pretty bad and in the area I'm most hoping they improve for Ragnarök.
Yeah, I think, like, the health bar for Baldum, it almost means nothing as well. It's like, well, I'm just going to slap him till, like, a cutscene happens and then the fight will be over. Like, that was how I felt the second time I fought him.
I was like, the framing is amazing, but yeah, I don't think it's a good boss fight by my criteria of what a good boss fight is to actually play against, do you know?
I think that's an area where I'm just wowed by the spectacle of it. I think the, like, the amount of digital real estate they have to build for those, just those stranger boss fights, like, so much stuff happens in the background of those fights, you almost understand why this game doesn't have any other boss fights, because it probably just killed them, because they're like, well, this fight is going to, like, take you, like, through realms, or there's going to be, like, an entire animated giant in the background, just doing shit, and, you know, you're like, the what's mad about the older games is they also did that scale, but they also had the kind of volume to it, it's, like, this game's got a very bad habit of taking just a regular enemy and giving it more health and calling it a boss, and that sucks, like, that, that just isn't fun. You're like, oh, it's a witch again, or it's, like, the worst boss is the dark elf at the end of Alfheim, because it's just some bug bloke who flies around and you kill him and you're like, this was a, that was a boss, like, he was a named boss with a health bar, what was that about?
Yeah, you have to fight two of them later on, I think, as well, in that room, that test room, when you go in between the realms, that was, that was hard work. I think, I felt like this was touched upon a little bit in that Raising Kratos documentary, where it showed them, like, it took them 18 months to make that one E3 demo, and they were like, and we've got 18 months left to finish the game, how the fuck do we fill this with content? Like, we made, we spent the same amount of time on one seven-minute demo, so how do we scale this for the rest of the game?
And there's bits where they're like, oh, if we make this boss fight, a boss battle arena too big, then it's going to take up the art team weeks to make it, and all these practical decisions, I imagine, led to that limitation in, like, enemy scope, like you say, hopefully that's something they can address next time.
Yeah, I don't mean to just neg on this game because, like, it's the top of our list. I was surprised, I was actually surprised to see it at the top of the list because I knew that you had sort of stalled on it, and so I assumed, oh, maybe you just wouldn't get on with it, but I'm glad that, like, playing the rest of it, like, it did click with you more.
You do, I think you do have to get to that dragon fight at the top of the mountain for it to start to, like, properly, for you to properly get what it's doing, and to really engage with it. I really like that dragon boss fight, but it's also just a, yeah, I think it just, it does just some really interesting things with the characters, and yes, I do like the wise cracking Scottish head, not sure how you feel about it, Matthew.
Oh, it's great. I like, actually, like, it's probably only got, like, seven or eight speaking characters this game, but I think they're all brilliantly cast.
Yeah.
Like, even the two, like, the two, even the two, like, comedy dwarves are, or whatever they are. Yeah, like, everyone in it, just, just really, like, land, you know, none of the characters are, like, hugely kind of cliché. They've all got something slightly original to say.
Most of them get the time to kind of explore their characters. I think the, the, the, the witch in the woods is, like, a really brilliant bit of, like, just character design, writing, voice work, performance capture, you know, she's a really compassionate, kind presence, which actually makes kind of what happens in the story land so well. Like, the, the end of this game feels very, like, they've really have built up to it.
It feels very, like, earned and I, I think what's different between, like, you know, what encapsulates this as opposed to, like, the previous games and how far they've, not how far they've come, but definitely how far they've changed is that, you know, this game, the final boss, there can be a, you know, there is a giant in the background and it isn't the focus of the fight. The focus of the fight is this kind of, like, tangle of interpersonal relationships between the four tiny humans below the giant where, like, in the old game it would have been flipped. It would have been, like, bring down that big fucking giant and hear it and you don't care.
You don't think, oh, I'd rather be fighting that, like, you are that invested in it and the story has worked so well and kind of drawn you in that that feels, you know, it feels like an epic family drama is playing out and, yeah, I really, really rate the end of this game. That fight, anyway.
While still doing amazing things with scale like the PS2 and PS3 games did, right? Like, you know, the world, when you see the world serpent in this or that giant in the end, it's like, you definitely get that same sense of scale. The feeling that you're in a land of myth, you know, this game does so, so well.
And I do love the idea as well of like you finding all of these premonitions of what will happen or what has already happened throughout the world. It's just very well realized as a kind of depiction of Norse mythology and Kratos just sort of like existing within it.
Yeah, it's I can't work out if it's a strength or a weakness that it gets you so excited for stuff that doesn't manifest in this game. Yeah, like the talk of Odin and Thor, you know, this is a character who is famous for chewing his way through the gods and actually he doesn't really meet many and he doesn't really fight many. And by the end, like when it's like after the boulder fight, there's like a tiny little bit more to the game and part of me on my first playthrough felt disappointed that like, oh, I don't even get to fight Thor.
I don't get to meet Thor. That's a bit of a shame. Like he's been a presence throughout this game.
Obviously, that will be paid off in Ragnarök, I would hope. But I feel like there is maybe a little bit too much set up for a sequel at times here.
It gambles on being the first half of a story and you not necessarily realising that until you get to the last like 20% of the game. But like because what is there still feels so generous, I think you kind of go along with it.
Yeah. I don't mean to look a gift horse in the mouth. When I first finished it, I was like, yeah, like it just builds and builds and builds and then just stops.
And I was like, oh, you know, like I felt like it's missing one last mega beat this game. But maybe that's me. You know, I'm the only person in the world who didn't like the quiet ending to Red Dead Redemption.
So maybe I'm just maybe I'm just busted when it comes to subtle conclusions.
Just need a god in space fight when you get to the top of the mountain, the top of the giant mountain, you fight the giant from space, who is God, and you punch him to death. I will also say like very, very picky Cris from here. But there's like a tendency for them to be like, oh, you've unlocked this new realm when you go there in space, you just like the way fight arena realm.
And you're like, yeah, interesting, yeah, and the giant realm is about is like basically like two staircases and one room. And that's the entire realm. And it's they talk about it the entire game and it's like, yeah, it's yeah.
But I think that like my thought criticism and the ending criticism speaks to the fact that like, this game is so like complete in so many ways, you really do think it's going to do everything and the couple of places it doesn't. The couple of places it doesn't quite deliver in the same way that it delivers everywhere else feel quite egregious because of it.
That's a beautiful way of putting it. It's like the game's own polish is its own worst enemy, basically.
Yeah. The couple of times you're like, oh, that felt rushed. Like nothing else does.
And it's always just the curse of these things. All good things, you know, must end at some point and your budget and time runs out. So and it's not like it's like broken anywhere.
It's just a little bit. I know what you mean. You're like, oh, like a time attack realm.
Do you remember when we were both at a dinner with the same person who used to work at Sony and they told us this game came together so late. It was like only basically the very last minute that this really comes next is like a masterpiece. Do you remember that conversation?
I remember that.
Yeah, I thought they said there was a version of this game which was a lot shorter.
Right, right.
And they had to add loads of stuff to it or like…
Yeah. Because I heard another thing where someone said it was like kind of like grey boxes everywhere in some bits until the very last minute and then like it was out of order and then there were some bits dropped together. I can't remember who told me that but it seems like this was a proper rush to finish ultimately.
All games are but this…
But it's mad though because there's so much stuff in it and like it's like the quality of its side quests, they're not bad, it's quite hard to differentiate some of the side quests from the main quest lines really. There are entire side areas where there are huge dragons and weird side stories and mechanics that only happen there. If it wasn't for the fact that a lot of the side quests do end with recycled.
Enemies as bosses, which I've already talked about, I hold this up as one of the few games where I do recommend doing all the side stuff because the dropping quality isn't that bad apart from maybe… I didn't do all the fucking smoke maze and the climbing up the volcano and all that shit.
If I was Xbox, I would have looked at this and gone, how much money do we have to spend to get our own version of this? It's such a great system seller, like a pure, you need to play this if you own the system kind of game. Microsoft has to have been sat there thinking, what is our version of this?
Because Sony has a few of them, but this is probably the best of them, and it's quite the thing. I am pleased that in a year that's been relatively starved of blockbusters that we are ending this year with another one of these, that is exciting, isn't it?
Oh, for sure. And that they've kept it so secret is a real treat. You know, they're just going to hit the ground running.
But just the idea of if they add more weapons, how will they handle from this perspective? I'd love to see that. And we're going to see the realms we didn't see in the first game, presumably, that'll be, surely that'll be exciting.
We'll actually get to kill some proper gods.
Yeah, that's it. Presumably they'll do all the other gods who didn't see the first one. Maybe one of the realms will have like a kart racing minigame in it, Matthew, who knows?
It's like, welcome to the unlockable art gallery realm. You're like, oh, Jesus. You're like, welcome to the sex minigame realm.
We're like, no, not this. We're like, well, it was the only thing missing from the last game.
That was a really funny thing you said to me off air, Matthew, about like, when they go to Helheim and see all the bad things Kratos has done start to appear in like Visage and you're like, thank God, none of the sex minigames appear here. That would have been a bit awkward to explain. Yeah, so yeah, being like, oh yeah, this was the, this was the Aphrodite one.
Can you just like cover your eyes and ears for about five minutes?
I just think the intensity as well of Kratos' bedroom in this, because it's like him and his wife's double bed and then the boy's bed is like right next to it. Like that kid does not get any privacy. That family is like way too, they're sleeping way too close.
I'd make him sleep in a shed outside.
Yeah, I'd build a bigger house, frankly, they've got fucking loads of real estate around there, you know what I mean?
I think that's, I think, I forget all the, you've been keeping secrets from me, I think the tension there is just, that house has been way too intimate.
Well, you're like, it's been a hundred years between the events of Greece and this. Maybe when he stabbed himself in the chest, he just became less horny, Matthew. He just became very flaccid for a hundred years.
Well, he has fathered a son, so we don't need to go into this. We don't need to make this as puerile as the PS2 God of War games. That's not the goal here.
So to end on there, Matthew, what's your definitive Kratos moment from this one?
It's hard, because he's a very different Kratos, isn't he? I mean, I think, probably this has to be kind of killing the dragon in the way he kills the dragon.
Yeah.
That's probably it, it's maybe a bit boring. I think using the giant's hammer to get to the bottom of the chisel has got like old Kratos energy.
Oh yeah, that whole set piece is great.
Yeah, like I'm going to use this massive thing to like solve this. Even all the other characters are like, are you really sure about this? This doesn't seem like it will work.
And he's just sort of like, trust me, not like I know this will work, but these things tend to work out well for him. I quite like that moment.
Yeah, there's some good Scottish head quips during those bits as well. This seems unlikely, but it will be fine. Smashing the ice actually as well in some of those sections is really, really cool.
And that giant looks rad in the snow. Really nicely done. Yeah, I would say that probably the very last moment of this game, which I won't spoil, like the last thing that affects your relationship with the witch in this game, the thing that Kratos does, that feels like a bit of the old Kratos coming back.
That kind of definitive, this is the only resolution. The only resolution is violence element to the character that is still here. Yeah, really, really good.
I absolutely loved it. It was a real treat to blast through. So much so that I just feel bereft now trying to like get through cyberpunk or fucking Norco or whatever before the end of the year.
Very different games. You heard it here first, Norco not as good as the Aphrodite mini game.
Yeah, that's definitely what I'm saying. Is there like a Blorko of the gods in these games, Matthew, do you think? Like one character, like, what the fuck is this guy?
I guess that who's that god you mentioned from the start of God of War Ascension? Maybe it's him, the one with the recombinant name.
That's the big monster. That's the Hecatonchires.
Hecatonchires has big Blorko energy. Let's face it.
Yeah, I mean, that's the only one where someone can shout like, It's the Hecatonchires! And you're like, sorry, what did you say? Is that the name of something or what?
Or is that several words? What happened there? Or one of the cats from Cats.
Mr. Hecatonchires?
Someone's going to write in now and say, I called my son Mr. Hecatonchires. Or, sorry, just the Hecatonchires bit. And like, well, we're here making fun of what may be a very noble Greek name.
Well, his boy Hecatonchires can take his revenge on us and pull our heads off in horrible ways if he wants.
We're only referring to the character as a joke, not the very concept of someone called Hecatonchires.
Okay.
All right. Good. Well, that's a good note to close out on then, Matthew.
Very comprehensive overview of the series there. Did you enjoy that?
Yeah, it was good fun. That was well worth playing 50 hours of God of War 4.
Yeah, it's good. But I got a bit of the old end of the graduate sound of silence going on now. Now that I've finished all these games and done this episode, this was like my north star for a while and now I have to focus back on normal life stuff.
You've got cyberpunk. And I lie on old Johnny Silverhand, be your guide.
Doesn't that have a fucking sex mini game thing in it? You're kind of doing it.
That's got all kinds of sexy stuff in it.
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm quite. I'm just not quite in that. I'm sort of in like an autumnal non-horny mood on the gaming side these days.
We can revisit that later. So Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
At MrBazzill underscore pesto.
