Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Oh, hello.
Hello, it's a Saturday morning, Matthew. Been a while since we've done a pod at this time. I think this is our best time to do a podcast.
Am I correct there? Or, because you've very much got into the I have a job now and I need lions phase of your life, and I do understand and empathize, but at the same time, I think we're always at our jolliest on Saturday mornings. Is that correct or am I wrong there?
I thought we were quite jolly when we did the Anticipated Games episode. I thought that was reasonably loose and limber, but yeah, you are probably right. I just like my lions.
Saturday morning is the time where I play an hour and a half of Paper Mario in bed.
Right, and I've taken that from you for this, basically.
Yeah.
Yeah. And how's that going, the thousand year door? I guess we're gonna talk about that on next week's episode of Beyond Week.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'll save my juicy thoughts for then, but, you know.
What a tease, what a tease! Yeah, it won't shock you. Yeah.
You were wrong, I was right, the Matthew Castle story. No, I look forward to that, Matthew. I was also gonna ask you, because we are coming up to our next Patreon poll.
We just did an episode on Beyond Good and Evil for the Patreon folks, so we just played through that game, talked about it, what it did well, what it did less well. That list was quite long, the latter list. But we're going to do another game in August, and we're gonna do a poll in July.
So we'll let people pick from six different games, and then on Patreon, we'll do a Two Giant Men play episode on that game. So Matthew, you have been agonizing over the selection process for your games that will be going into the poll. How's that been going?
I actually thought I had some, and now I've forgotten what they are, and I've realized I haven't written them down anywhere.
Well, you mentioned Supergiant as a potential sort of...
Yeah, I did wonder about that. I mean, they're quite short, aren't they?
Well, I mean, Hades goes on forever, you know? I think most of them are about 10 hours long.
Yeah, I did wonder about filling in some Supergiant, a Supergiant gap, just because they're sort of, you know, mega-indie and the popularity of Hades. I thought it might be interesting to go back to one of their earlier things. It feels slightly redundant because I feel like people are just going to vote for whatever was second last time.
I feel like we're doomed to Shenmue, but I'm going to try and remain positive and hopeful that doesn't happen.
We could split the Shenmue voters by chucking in some more Sega nonsense from the North East and just put in a tactically debilitating Shenmue vote.
I don't know. That feels like trying to put out a fire with gasoline, though. Really, I want to stamp out Sega in general as a thing because that's something I'm just not as interested in.
Bad news, Matthew. My Sega Saturn has been repaired and returned to my house.
That means you can come round our house and I can buy a load of treats again.
That is what matters, is how many cookies you consume ultimately. That's the end game. I'm like noodling Returnal and one other game, but I've not quite settled on what the other game is yet either.
Because I lost the PSP draft so badly, I've decided the listeners no longer deserve to have Metal Gear Asset 2 in there, Matthew, so that's going to be my punishment towards them. That's how I operate. I'm trying to think of something a bit more, because I don't want to pick anything too left field because people won't pick it.
Pick anything too old and people won't pick it either. So we saw this when we had Snatcher in the poll and Super Metroid. They both just got ignored basically.
Super Metroid did better than Snatcher. Oh, that was it. Earthbound was the one that got ignored along with them.
Yeah, I was surprised by that.
Yeah, I think that's maybe because the whole Earthbound obsession is more of an American thing, just obviously because it didn't come out here. But I always thought it was an object of great fascination as a Nintendo player. I always thought that was something you kind of coveted, but apparently not, at least not on this podcast.
I guess there's plenty of sort of like, you know, probably retronauts episodes and stuff on the mother games, so fair play. But yeah.
I'm just hoping that the Beyond Good and Evil episode showed that if you force us to play your favorite game, we're not going to humor you and necessarily be nice about it. So maybe that will put the Shenmue people off because it will just get like battered for an hour and a half. So it's not like you're going to you can't force us to like it, which I feel like we've established with Beyond Good and Evil.
Yeah, I'm also not really in the headspace of wanting to play through. You look at how long to beat, right? And, you know, there are more liars on how long to beat than in any other part of the Internet, I would say.
Just people who say that, like, you know, I finished Dragon's Dogma 2 in under 20 hours or whatever. And you're like, well, that's just not true, you know? I mean, unless you ignored literally every side quest and just speed running across the map.
Didn't happen, dog. That's just, you'll spend that time just walking in the wilderness, you know? But with Shenmue, it's like people sit on there, say it's 20 hours, but you know it's going to be like fucking 35 and you and I are going to be like, I can't believe I just wasted a month of my life playing this like Dreamcast game for the XL tier.
Whereas if we do like a 10-hour game like Beyond Good and Evil, it kind of comes and goes, and it is a nice opportunity to tick something off. So I'm worried that Shenmue will just be like a loss for all involved. The listeners who made us do it and got like takes that weren't necessarily what they were looking for and us just being like grumpy and sad.
So there's no winners there, you know?
Yeah. Well, let's wait and see. Come on, Patreon voters, do the right thing.
Yeah, exactly. Like as someone pointed out, Shenmue is very much the reform party of the XL tier vote. I had a question for you actually.
I thought about this on the way to the supermarket. Should we do like a sort of like election draft next month where we have to fill a cabinet with video game characters? Well, I just thought about this on the way to the supermarket.
Would that be quite fun to do like an election special? And it's like you're going for parliament and I'm going for parliament and like your secretary of health is medic from Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater. Is that a good idea or is that a bad idea?
Yeah, I think we can make that work.
Yeah, that's good. It sounds like it's easy to put together and high chance of chaos, which is the magic formula for The Back Page:. So look forward to that in July and the actual election, which will be far more depressing.
So Matthew, Gamescourt, a recap of what this is. In the pandemic, like a lot of people over the age of 30, I started buying retro games. There was a big old games drought, people might remember.
God of War Ragnarok came out, Norco came out. Records from that time are spotty at best, but I don't recall any other video games coming out that year.
That was it. Just Norco and Ragnarok.
So it was quite quiet. Actually, that was 22, wasn't it? But 21, 22, there was a series of delays to next-gen things because of the pandemic, which makes sense.
It feels like games industry has definitely caught up now, given the volume of stuff that's coming out. It came out last year and is coming out this year, so that's fine. But in that chasm of time, I started buying up retro games on eBay.
This is around the time that these prices started spiking as well. Partly inspired by this podcast as well. There's a lot looking back on this podcast, me dipping into the past.
What I did was I lined up a bunch of my purchases in a court format with Matthew as a judge. I said, was it okay that I bought a bleach on DS for Â£9? Basically, that was essentially the format.
I ran through 20 games, bought some good stuff in there, some more experimental stuff. I think I survived both of the original Games Courts that we did, Matthew, because of the sheer volume of DS games that you gave 76 in NGamer. That's how I managed to get through that.
Is there anything else you want to add to what Games Court is as we get into the episode?
It isn't a serious endeavor. I'm not an expert in pre-owned game prices. I don't really know the true worth of anything.
It's all gut feeling.
Nor are you a judge.
I should point that out. I always worry that legitimate retro heads who are invested in this stuff will listen to these episodes and just find me very ill-informed. I mean, that is true.
I am ill-informed. But it's also not the point of it. And I don't really care about that.
So yeah, basically that's my typical Games Court disclaimer.
Yeah, I think that's the thing. We're sort of like we're not really in the headspace of retro guys who lord it over you on, you know, on sort of like YouTube or social media or whatever. That's not really our whole deal.
You know, we're not we're not here to be like, well, actually, it's outrageous that you paid three grand for Panzer II.
I don't think like unless it's like extremely low or extremely high, it's more like, is it worth having this game in your life is what I'm interested in. Yeah, it would have to be like really bizarre pricing to kind of to get me to like, you know, shit on a beloved game, for example. But, you know, yeah, they come up as and when like, you know, you know, a bad game's got entry when you see one.
Yeah, and there'll definitely be a few bad ones in this one. So, yeah. So basically, we have done like I say, we have done one of these for me since September 2021.
I don't realize it been that long since we did. My purchases. Yeah, this very much became, I didn't realize how quickly this became a listener, game score format, sort of like concern basically.
So I realized I did just stop buying as many games at the end of 2021. I did kind of slow down quite a bit. So that's probably why is I just didn't want to sort of force the episode when I only had like five or six things to discuss.
Not much of a podcast and that not much meat on the bones. But yes, it's been a while since we've done one. But I would admit that I've got an array of exciting things, dubious things, overpriced things, enough stuff to create a bit of drama and interest.
And this will be a real good barometer of what Matthew just said, which is, is it worth having versus is that price preposterous? Because the price in some ways is the drama. You know, you hear the price and you're like, oh, you're like, oh, that's pretty good.
And that's kind of like the two games court reactions. Yeah. But as mentioned, like, I just haven't bought as many games since the pandemic or secondhand games.
There have been newer games to spend time on. The shape of this podcast has changed a little bit. I'd say it's gone slightly more towards contemporary games chat and away from sort of retro games chat.
Is that fair, Matthew? Do you think it's a bit more in the way of like we do the what we've been playing episodes and that sort of stuff? We're keeping our eye on them on the ball a little bit more.
I don't know.
Yes, I mean, that's partly tied to the fact that, you know, my day job is very embedded in contemporary games, as is yours. And so I want to be able to kind of capitalise on those things when we do go retro. It's for like bigger, you know, the top tens or, you know, retrospectives, which we haven't done as many of mainly because we've done some most of the biggies that really meant a lot to us.
And they're like a huge amount of work to prep also. Yeah, I've never really thought of it as a retro podcast per se, just because I think that's a turn off for a lot of people. Including you.
Definitely. I wouldn't listen to a retro podcast. And so, yeah, yeah, but I think that's probably fair.
I just need to get on and play like the problem is of the big retro ideas that I kind of have like, oh, I would like to do, you know, a big series deep dive on Fire Emblem. But filling in the gaps on that is like hundreds of hours. And it's like, that's a lot for two hours of podcast.
But a lot of people go, oh, I don't like Fire Emblem, so I won't listen to that one. Yeah, it's, yeah, difficult.
Yeah, the one I really want to do is Gears of War.
Yeah, I think that's doable, though.
Yeah, they're all like 10 hours long, basically, or shorter.
And I'm up for like replaying all of those.
Yeah, that would be good. And we're going to do Dragon Age. We're not going to replay the Dragon Ages, but Matthew's been playing Inquisition again.
I will play some Inquisition as well, and we will do that ahead of the new one coming out. So that's on the table. The big one that sort of like hasn't been touched, and it's sort of an emergency break glass episode, Mario.
You know, we haven't done that. Matthew, that's sort of like, I guess, the Mario version of that Excellent Zelda episode you did three years ago, you know?
Yeah, I think more people would be upset, because I'm just so all in on 3D Mario these days. That's my only worry is, like, can I deliver the 2D Mario stuff in a satisfying manner?
Yeah, it's also more interesting depth in terms of critical discussion to Zelda than Mario. I would argue that's maybe a little bit of it as well, just because the way that the style diverges across the different 3D games, and, you know, like, it's maybe a little bit... I know, obviously, Mario gets involved from football to, you know, party games or whatever, but I know with Zelda, like, the kind of, like, the through line is just always changing, and maybe that's a bit more interesting to discuss.
Am I wrong there? Is Mario just as interesting to discuss, Matthew?
No, I think that's right. I mean, Zelda has, you know, the great gameplay, but it also has, like, more, like, story trappings and, like, world trappings around it. Mario is a bit more, like, abstract, a bit kind of purer to talk about just as a game, but it maybe lacks some of the, you know, some of that extra cladding, which means a lot in Zelda and is, like, a good jumping-in point and, you know, stuff that people, like, identify with.
Mario, I'd say, is maybe, like, harder to have that. That said, if we did do Mario, like, spin, most of the spin-offs are, like, instantly off the table. You know, we're talking, we're quite, we're talking, like, purist, you know, mainline Mario games, I think.
Yeah, no Mario is missing in there, dog, so, yeah. Yeah, I agree, it's sort of like series retrospectives. Yeah, we did tick off a lot of our key favourites, you know, like the Zelda Uncharted.
Yeah, like, we did Mass Effect. We did a whole bunch of them. There's probably more I'm not thinking of.
I did kind of want to do an Assassin's Creed episode, but I haven't played every single one, and I don't think I'll ever have time to play every single one, so maybe that's the one where we get like an X button or something.
Yeah, that's a toughie as well, like, but there's a lot of those, and they don't necessarily change as much as you'd hope.
So I do wonder if there's enough material in that, really, because, yeah, like, it's loads of games, but do I have loads to say about them? I've not already said. I think people probably have figured out what our Assassin's Creed takes are on these episodes, by now, you know, just covering the different games that have released over the period that we were working, Games Media, and discussing some of the more recent ones.
Anyway, that's a...
Should we do Fable when Fable comes out?
That's a great one. We should definitely do that. I've never played that, the original Fable, actually, so that would be a good thing to do.
Oh, but the anniversary edition's quite nice on the 4K Xbox update or whatever they call it.
Yeah, I should just get on that, really. So, yeah, that would be good to discuss. Those are also quite short games.
Yeah, that is the key factor. Oh, Metroid as well is one I'd like to do at some point.
Yes, yeah, yeah.
That's good. But we can wait for Prime 4 to come out. That's a good sort of like incentive for Nintendo to get Prime 4 done, basically, is you'll get an episode of them.
Just think how solid that episode will be.
Yes, great content. So, yeah. Okay, then, Gamescore.
So, in this episode, I'm going to chuck in a few of my comedy Tokyo purchases for a bit of variety. In fact, actually, I said a few. It's only one because there's actually loads and loads of regular ones to discuss.
That's fine. Key thing to establish, then, is that, I mean, again, there's a lot of, like, law that needs to be sort of explained up front with Gamescore these days. This all takes place on Matthew Castle Island, which is a sort of, like, North Korea-esque, kind of like, island nation sort of dictatorship where Matthew is both judge and also the ruler.
And time is banned there. The internet is banned there. Yeah.
Matthew's great friends with Kim Jong-un. That's, like, an established part of the law as well, I believe. And then, I don't know, is there anything else I'm missing?
No, you have a sort of rival nation on Samuel Roberts Peninsula.
Yeah, we don't talk about that, though. It's kind of gone... It's gone so wrong that I've just sort of abandoned...
I've left the people to it, basically, and just sort of... I'll go back in five years and see how they're doing, but it's been a while since I've checked in with those guys, so I live in a little shack on the island. I am the attorney.
Normally, I represent the listeners who submit their games to court entries, but this time, I'm representing myself. So, yeah. What's new on Matthew Castle Island these days, Matthew?
Well, to celebrate my crushing defeat of Samuel Roberts Peninsula in the recent soundtrack draft, I've made the theme from We Shop Channel, the national anthem of Castle Island, sung with the lyrics from that funny YouTube video I like. And, buoyed by that victory and riding high in the polls, I've decided to reinforce my power by calling for a general election. Once again, I'll be running on a platform of eternal life and picking nicks for all.
I think you're conflating the Matthew Castle Productions law there with the Matthew Castle Island law, Matthew.
It's all connected.
It's like Lost.
Newsflash. It's all connected. Of course, my rivals are making the same old dumb noise about what fun is eternal life if your teeth have been rotted away by fizzy cola bottles, to which I reply, free mashed potato for all.
At least I think it's mashed potato. It's stored in a very shadowy alcove.
Good throwback.
Yeah, thank you.
One thumb up from the corner.
Of course, Wario is running against me, who is a very big threat. Just physically, we're quite similar candidates, and that could prove confusing to the voters. So I'm turning the full power of the courts against him.
He's on trial with 34 felony counts for spending hush-garlic on covering up an affair with Mona from WarioWare.
Did you see my gag on Discord, Matthew, where I said that the 8% of Nintendo that the Saudi Games Fund own is Wario?
That's what they get.
I was quite proud of that. It's like you get Wario and nothing else, basically.
Wario and Barbara Bapp from Jam With The Burn.
And Doshin The Giant, yeah.
Of course, I'm more worried about the threat from Michael Cain, who is running on an open up the internet and reinstate the concept of time platform and also banning the practice of prestiging people in water-filled boxes. Thankfully, the latter has taken care of most of his demographic. That is what's happening on Castle Island.
Oh, we got there. It's a lot of law in there. That's good.
A lot of throwbacks for the real heads.
Yeah, that's what I thought. I thought let's give the real heads something to chew on.
That's good. Was that technically your opening speech then as well?
No, no, no. I've got a separate opening speech.
Amazing. I look forward to it. So who's in the courtroom today, Matthew?
There's no jury because you are the jury.
Yeah. We've got lots of interesting onlookers. We've got Wario, of course, but he's just here because his trial is on after this.
We've got a load of thirst traps from Hades. I don't really know their specific names, but they're all kind of like muscular and sexy. We've got Dr. Carol, the flying laptop from Perfect Dark, moaning about not being in the new trailer for Perfect Dark.
I love that. That's great.
We've got the clown with a baseball bat from that Bellatro card that gives you 1.5 multiplier for uncommon cards.
That is such a pull from a man who has played way too much Bellatro in a short space of time.
We've got Sean Connery from Russia With Love, but he only says Bellatro. We've got Paper Luigi from Paper Mario. I don't know why he's just here.
And we've got that guy who sold you your dodgy Dreamcast looking slightly nervous.
Oh, no, that's fine. He was legit. It's the guy who sold me the dodgy Saturn who, when I said, are you sure you didn't know this?
You knew this didn't work properly? When you sold it to me, just sort of disappeared on Facebook Marketplace. He might even be listening to this.
Well, I'm just introducing... Just bear in mind the concept of Sam bought a dodgy piece of hardware of some sort. You need to just remember that.
Ah, okay, I see.
But you may need that in the opening speech.
Okay, good to know. All right, that is good. You were right when you said off air that you'd put more effort into this one, The Last Game's Court, Matthew.
I recognize that effort, so that's good.
Thank you.
How will I be punished if found guilty? That's always the key thing. So novelty punishment for the guilty.
Yeah, we're going to use those eyelid tweezers from Clockwork Orange to hold your eyes open. And then you spend the rest of your life having to read hot takes about how Dragon Age The Veil Guard is not the Dragon Age I know and love.
Oh yeah, those were the worst takes. Like, oh yeah, which one is that? The game from 2009 that was nothing like the two games that followed that?
Are you still fucking talking about it?
See how cross you are? You definitely don't want this punishment.
No, I mean, that's the thing. I just sort of, like, people have been complaining about Bioware combat systems for as long as I've been working in games media. They're like, well, it's not my Bioware RPG.
I've said that about literally every fucking single one. I bet you, like, go back and find people on forums in 2007, say, well, Mastavut looks like a step down from Kotor. And, like, I've got to say, those people have to touch grass, as the kids say, Matthew.
So yeah, yeah.
So it's this forever. This is the rest of your life if you lose.
What happens when Veilguard comes out? And, you know, would the takes change, or is it just the same takes from a certain period of time?
No, it's the same takes, I think.
Well, I appreciate that.
I don't want to update it. I don't want it just to be, like, whatever is the take you most dislike at any given time is being pumped into your eyes. I like this specific take, because it seemed to, like, well, as just demonstrated it, it got under your skin in a very particular way.
Yeah, I think people just have to get off Bioware's backs until the game comes out. You can complain about it then, you know? That's fine.
Oh, yeah, by all means. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Okay, what if I need the bathroom during this punishment? Is that a thing you've thought about? Or do I just have to wear a nappy and be changed?
Like, how ongoing is this?
Yeah, you are stuck in a chair. You're strapped to a chair. Your eyes are open.
You're just fed a pick and mix. Of course, you've got eternal life as well. So, it really is just forever.
It's the worst. It's not death. It's just the worst existence imaginable.
Damn. This looks like it would be a good side quest for the game Atomfall that's coming out. You come across a man who's being force fed pick and mix while in a clockwork orange machine.
That would be good, Matthew.
I thought that game was like 50s, 60s. Did they have pick and mix in the 50s?
Oh, yeah, definitely. Pick and mix has got big blitz era UK energy.
You think the blitz had something where it was pick and mix?
No, I mean...
That sounds very, very historic.
There's no historical basis to this. I'm just guessing. Doesn't pick and mix seem like something they had in 50s, 60s time?
Pick and mix is not like a good... Woolworths didn't invent pick and mix is what I'm saying.
I think pick and mix has got big 80s energy.
Right, so what is the original pick and mix? It's like dolly mix, for example. Let's see how long dolly mix is.
I think that's different to pick and mix.
Is it?
That's dolly mix.
But dolly mix has got pick and mix energy. It's got like a...
No, dolly mix has got pick and mix energy. The most back page podcast bullshit quote ever.
Well, look, there is something on... The dolly mix can be traced back to at least the 50s. I will say the Wikipedia page on this is inconclusive.
That's a product that sounds old as shit. They're like, oh, dolly mix, pick and mix. I just think that mmm is very trendy.
But pick and mix is like whatever you want to make it. It's only in recent years that people started adding fucking Tangfastics to it and stuff. Just because they didn't have that in Dover in World War II, it doesn't mean that...
Anyway, dolly mix. I maintain dolly mix as pick and mix.
It was like licorice and peanut brittle and that kind of stuff.
Licorice all-sourced and dolly mix, those are pick and mix. Surely those are pick and mix.
No, they're just this.
Listeners, let us know what you think.
Pick and mix isn't on trial here.
26 minutes since this podcast. You're on trial here. I am on trial here.
Time for the opening speeches. Matthew, do you want to do yours first or shall I do mine first?
I'll do mine first.
Okay, go for it.
Welcome to Castle Island, where the pick and mix flows liberally, life is eternal and no one is secretly killed at night by being dunked into a water tank. Citation needed. I am Judge Castle and in the immortal words of my legendary soundtrack draft pick, you've got a friend in me.
Well, you've got a friend in me as long as you've not wasted your money on the fanciful fluff of yesteryear. In this regard, Samuel Roberts is not on trial today. Good sense is on trial.
Does Samuel Roberts possess this good sense? That is a murkier matter. Here is a man, after all, who thought it was totally legitimate to take a bin bag of five pound notes to meet a man called Tony the Shark in a derelict industrial estate just so he could play Floyd Gun brothers on a cheap street cast.
A man who traveled halfway round the world to Japan only to spend most of his time sitting in his pants playing Metal Gear Solid in his friend's flat only leaving for his daily hit of convenience store chicken.
His partner and daughter were there. I was not in my pants. I was wearing trousers at all times to make that clear.
Carry on.
A man who thought he deserved to win the soundtrack draft because he picked a remix of the Afterburner theme and the sprawling mess that is the Smash Brothers soundtrack. He is not on trial for these events, but they paint a convincing picture of a man who cannot be trusted with his own time or money.
Very good, Matthew. I enjoyed that. Yeah, it's sort of like there's a lot to dissect there.
There's a lot of you half-remembering things I've told you then, Bill, which I do respect, you know, so well done. I enjoyed that. That was good.
All right. So it's time for my speech as well. So ladies and gentlemen of the court, this morning, sorry, I forgot there's no time here once again.
I was awoken by a poorly rendered Baron Samadhi from Golden Eye 007 on N64 and marched this courtroom. And much like unlocking the Egyptian level in that game, Judge Castle's system of justice is cruel and unusual. I recently had my video game collection shipped to Matthew Castle Island from Samuel Roberts Peninsula, only to wake up and find several classics censored by the notoriously strict ratings board of this UN violation of a nation state.
Who fancies a game of splitters too on GameKeep? Trigger on the SNES. Or Mario & Luigi Partners Inn on DS?
Even my DVD collection wasn't spared. I can't say watching Park Chan-wook's boy has the same appeal. Nor does The Virgin with Steve Carell.
But enough about trivialities. This is Big Boy Court. For the first time in three years, sorry, I forgot again, I representing myself in the court floor.
And what you have here are three years worth of second-hand video game purchases, a period of time that encompasses three different jobs, one break-up, the launch of a semi-liquidive and frankly enabling Patreon fund, several draft episodes and numerous baffling choices. I ask for clemency from the judge, who spends his Patreon earnings on cheeseburgers and going to the opera. Once again, to paraphrase Philip Schofield, these purchases were unwise but not illegal.
In many ways, isn't Judge Castle the same? I hear he's consorting with Labour Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streating to start taking over chunks of the NHS via his private offshore holdings. Vowing to bring down A&E wait times because he doesn't believe in the concept of time.
Justice? This man's only brush with justice are his nightly viewings of Zack Snyder's Justice League on the island's sole portable TV. And much like that movie, this courtroom would benefit greatly if he just raid it the fuck in.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Do you enjoy that? That was long and packed. I love the games and films we imagined for Castle Island.
A lovely touch. I was not expecting to hear the name Wes Streeting in this episode, or indeed this podcast.
Yeah. Okay, good. Well, we've been talking for 30 minutes.
Shall we take a quick break, Matthew, then come back with the actual game score bit?
Yeah, let's do it.
So, I just set the tone a bit too excitedly there. It's basically just a bunch of games. No, it's not.
It's too late to sell this format to a low-level cable sort of free-view channel.
If people are still listening after all that, they're in.
Exactly, if you got this far, you know what the deal is. Otherwise, you just turn it off and go on to listen to, I don't know, the IGN UK podcast.
My perfect console.
The rest is politics.
Yeah, there are. Okay, exhibit A then. Right, we start in 2021, end of, well, beginning of November, but not quite out of the pandemic woods yet.
I was still a bit too afraid to go outside for prolonged periods of time. Went for the occasional dinner, but didn't do that much. This was the sort of era where I was buying a lot of these games.
You can, this is sort of like the back end of the big burst of retro stuff I was buying. But I think it's a good one to start off with, Matthew. It's Viewtiful Joe on GameCube for Â£13.51.
So this game I don't own on anything in my flat at present. I didn't own anything in my flat at present because my PS2 is at my parents' house. I do have a copy of Viewtiful Joe there, but it's not actually my PS2 anymore.
I gave it to my dad, but the games collection has been looked after there because frankly, it's too large to fit into my little space. So it's not with me at present. I think we've done maybe some kind of Capcom.
Actually, it was probably the GameCube versus Xbox draft that was quite tense at the time, where you said no one has an Xbox in the UK, which I know you maintain your position on that being correct.
Yeah, that is true.
So a side-scrolling Capcom game, lovely French comic book infused graphics. We talked about this game on Best Games of 2002 or 2003 quite recently. We've discussed it very recently.
But what do you think of this purchase, Matthew, for this price?
I'm intrigued by the law of it being the law, the fact that it is at your parents' house, that your dad has it, like the idea that your dad could feasibly, there is now potential that he could play this game, and the idea of him going from the saboteur to beautiful Joe. I mean, that would be a jump. Have you considered introducing him to it?
No, it's a waste of time. I tried to get him into Bolartro, but he wasn't having it. Sean Connery is just perked up, by the way.
I was trying to say to him that this will eat any amount of time that you give it. It's wonderful. You will love this.
I just could not get him across the line with it. Couldn't get him to buy Dark Forces Remastered, as I previously discussed. He is so set in his ways on games.
There's a few Call of Duty campaigns he will play, and the saboteur and nothing else. That's basically his whole deal. He's like World War II or bust, basically.
So it's not going to happen. Viewable Joe is so far from something that he would even think about touching. That's the difference between our generation and his, Matthew.
We are open minded to Viewable Joe. We understand why Capcom matters.
Do you think less of you if he saw you playing it?
He probably has seen me playing it, because I think I bought it on PS2 in 2006, and I played it loads and loads. As soon as I got it, he probably heard the infernal sounds that this game makes coming out of my portable TV at the time.
The evil tomb is in the house.
But it's also just yummy. It's the sound effects when you slow down time, and it becomes really, when he hits an enemy in this game, it's a proper sort of smash, you know what I mean? Remember that sound where it's like, tsh, and then the enemy just goes flying?
The yummy though. That's cursed, isn't it?
It is cursed, but it's an iconic cursed soundboard, this game, isn't it? It's, yeah, it's really something.
Yeah, I mean, listen, I feel like we're going around the houses, or I've taken us around the houses here. It's Viewtful Joe. It's great, GameCube, you know, arguably where it truly belongs.
13 pounds, seems very reasonable for a classic. I am not gonna pump bad takes into your eyes for this one.
So not guilty. Okay, that makes sense. I mean, that's an easy one to start off with, isn't it?
Which takes us into our next one, which is less easy. Exhibit B, Brute Force on the original Xbox, 399. This is on 9th of November, 2021 or so.
Like the, you know, inside you do it, there are two wolves. One is Viewtful Joe, one is Brute Force, same day. Bought both of these.
Again, probably tied to the draft. I remember at the time, this was hyped up as a kind of like third person alternative to Halo. I think there was a bit of like sort of energy behind it.
And it reviewed, it reviewed all right, but obviously was not considered an all time classic in the way that Halo was. So I can't really justify this too much. I don't think this is even backwards compatible on, you know, Series X or anything.
So it's a bit of a lost Xbox artifact. However, you know, there is, in the back of my head, there is some unfinished business with the original Xbox. I've got to have some way to access that library for the Steel Battalion thing that will come up very soon on this episode.
And also just in general, like it'd be nice to have to play some of the games that you can't play on the modern consoles. But I feel like I'm not getting Brute Force over the line here, Matthew, thoughts?
No, I just searched for Brute Force, looked at the cover art, saw like a giant kind of crocodile looking thing with the grenade launcher. And I'm afraid that's a no from me, dog.
If I told you that was Star Fox, you'd be like, oh, a bold reinvention for the Star Fox series.
No, honestly, this looks, the character on this is just atrocious.
I haven't played it either, so there's no way.
And you haven't played it, you haven't really got the easiest means of playing it. No, come on. Come on.
It might be backwards compatible on 360, so I do have a 360, it might work on that. He's not having it, so it's a guilty for that one. Okay, getting through these quickly.
Exhibit C, this is where it gets interesting. Paper Mario, the Thousand Year Door, 89.99, 10th of December, 2021. I don't know why I bought this.
Was I anti-depressants at the time? There might be a bit of that. There was a lot of chaotic purchases happening around that time.
But yeah, so this end of December, and I think I just thought I got the GameCube up and running again. I got the component cable plugged in, and I was quite excited about the GameCube for a little burst of time there. And I think I weighed up this or Skies of Arcadia, thinking, well, they'll never remaster these.
Guess what, dog? It's three years later and they have. So that's unfortunate.
But I think the timeframe should be considered in discussing this one, Matthew. But what do you think generally?
Yeah, it is really hard to uncouple from the fact that there's just a shinier, better version. I know there are some din corners of the internet who are still like, eh, the original 60 frames and the remake isn't. But we don't really care about those people.
Notoriously, sticklers for framerates, Nintendo fans, aren't they?
I know. Give me a break, you big dumb babies. I know this one is, was, or maybe it probably still is, I guess, hard to come by and so expensive.
But I do feel like, I just feel like its reputation and its desirability was so overdone by the thousand year door fans. It's tough. It's a good game.
Like, I mean, you know, not to get ahead of next week's episode. I'm, I'm in, I'm enjoying, you know, I'm enjoying it. It's great.
You know, probably is the best paper Mario or Mario RPG still. It's just, I don't know, 90 quid. It's feel like you're, you're buying into a particular brand of madness that I hate around this game.
Yeah, it's tough. I don't, I got a point. It's probably a good time to point out that I don't think this is big or clever.
A lot of these purchases are very...
You definitely wouldn't do this now, would you?
No, I wouldn't.
You just bought it because you wanted to play it. And now you can play it in an easier format.
Yes, precisely.
Yeah. I'm going, I'm going to be kind. I'm going to, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to let you off on this one.
I'm going to take the time into consideration. This was a dark time. Lots of people did, made bad decisions and did stupid things coming out of lockdown.
And, you know, but let it go on record. This game is never worth Â£90 in any way, shape or form, you know? It just, it just isn't.
That's preposterous. But that's...
Well, thank you. I appreciate your leniency at this difficult time. Yeah, that's good.
And so, yeah, we come to next purchase. A bit of a time jump here. So maybe I learned my lesson from that.
I was like, right, no more preposterous game purchases for a little while. Or maybe I just had better things, more things going on at the time. I don't remember either way.
But Exhibit D is Assassin's Creed Unity on Xbox One. It was Â£4.05. And I bought this on the 19th of March, 2022.
So I think this is the time, because there's four linked purchases in a row here, I would say. So I think this is the time when I bought a Series X. So I was just...
And I read all the big and shiny sort of backwards compatibility stuff on the internet, and I was like, I want a piece of that. So Assassin's Creed Unity, famously a bit ropey at launch. Just everyone saw the curse, kind of like floating eyes and face thing from one of the NPCs.
It was quite buggy. And then when we talked about it subsequently, I think on that Excel episode where we talked about the best backwards compatible games. This is quite an undertaking of production values, even by the standards of modern Assassin's Creed games.
Just how lavish Paris looks, how much the NPCs have going on. It feels in some ways like a maximalist version of the original Assassin's Creed vision or like Assassin's Creed 2 kind of era vision. It's that kind of city, it's that kind of city-based Assassin's Creed experience.
This is before it becomes an RPG, etc. I think as a location to behold, it's kind of worth it for that alone, just to see the Paris they built for this game. Pretty amazing.
They gave it away when there was a fire at Notre Dame a few years ago, because I think they actually based the Notre Dame in this on the original blueprints, it's ridiculously accurate.
Wasn't the story that they had the most accurate 3D model of Notre Dame because they made it for the game, so it was useful for rebuilding it? That sounds mad if that's true.
It kind of makes sense because why else would someone be building that, I guess. Basically, it's Les Mis, Assassin's Creed. What are your thoughts, Matthew?
I am quite fond of this game. Is this one way it runs way better if you don't patch it or something? Is that the deal?
I think the only way you can play it at 60 FPS is if you do that on PS4 or something. It's something like that. Yeah, it rings a bell.
But yeah, I do take your point about it was a good halfway house between the older Assassin's Creed before it goes full RPG. I think it did have equipment and stuff that you'd buy to improve yourself, like RPG elements. It's also had the, I think it made the kills like a little bit more, a little bit more Hitman-y in terms of there were like story things you could do to sort of trigger signature kills, you know, or you could just run across the rooftops and like jump on someone with a dagger or whatever.
An idea they lent into like a lot more with Syndicate where they really do treat the kills as as like, this is like a Hitman level. There are like four different ways of doing this kills for you to discover, etc, etc. I quite, yeah, I did quite like Unity.
I'm for four quid as well. I mean, that's not, that's not, that's not much and there is a reason to buy it. Like I absolutely get where you're coming from in terms of like, I've watched those like Digital Foundry do the videos for their like, we test, you know, 50 Xbox 360 games that run better on Series X and you come out of those videos going, I should probably go to CEX and buy some of these and I have done that myself.
So I just couldn't possibly say guilty on the grounds that I recognize too much of my own behavior in this.
Yeah, that's the thing. I think anything under Â£10, as long as the game is not bad, as long as it's not wasting time, I think it's basically like wasting space rather. I think it's, it's okay.
And I did actually play this as well. I probably got about 10 hours in when we were doing the, when I got my Series X, that's not too bad. And I did think it was pretty good.
And yeah, like you say, the original vision of Assassin's Creed, allegedly, was to go for the Hitman kind of thing, wasn't it? It was like you decide how you kill the target. Then the game came out, it turned out you only had three weapons, and that was not the case at all.
But when they did Unity, they revisited that idea. And that was part of what they were pitching, basically. So yeah, okay, good.
Lots of nice velvet coats as well, which I like.
In general, it doesn't really look like a game from 10 years ago, which is what it is. It's sort of like, you know, it arguably looks slightly better than the London Assassin's Creed does. It's a very, very lavish thing.
Okay, then we come to Exhibit E, which I don't think you can get me on. The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings on 360, Â£9.39, 26th of March, 2022. Key thing to point out here, I do have this on PC, however I wanted to play it on my couch because the pandemic happened, I ain't sitting in my PC to play RPGs anymore, dog.
So that's unfortunate, and working from home culture means that PC gaming has been ruined forever unfortunately. But yes, what do you think of this one Matthew?
I mean, you know I like this. I feel like you've come to this courtroom today with things that I can't possibly punish. I mean, this is, I mean, yeah, it would be grotesque of me to pretend that I don't like The Witcher 2.
Like, or maybe think it's the best Witcher game, maybe. At times, I think it is. I think the best of The Witcher is in this game, is probably the best way of putting it.
And yeah, I played it on 360 as well. The Enhanced Edition, you know, they did a pretty good job of translating something which was firmly PC into something that you could enjoy on the console. Playing it as well, obviously some buy-in to The Witcher 3.
It makes The Witcher 3 feel richer as a result because of the kind of continuing story branches and whatnot. So yeah, yes, this is a good purchase.
I do agree. It's maybe like it's a little bit too sort of like, you know, I've got to good taste in games at my core, right? You know this.
We're at least partially aligned. How about we raise the stakes? I'm going to give you two guilty verdicts where the guilty verdicts counters like five guilty verdicts.
Oh, shit.
So they're like tokens you can spend as we go. You can like use them.
So you get two mega guilty tokens and you can use those on whatever you wish. I don't think so far we've had anything that really...
Okay, yeah. I was going to say, like I don't think... I think so far my rulings have been just...
Yeah, I think so. I mean, a mega guilty is a bit lenient on Paper Mario. Maybe, but yeah, this raises the stakes a bit.
So you can throw it your way because so far it is four not-guilties to one guilty. So this raises the stakes a little bit. We've got 28 exhibits in total, so it does, you know, that's, but yeah, go on.
I like that your life's on the line, but you're still very keen for like the showmanship of the episode.
Exactly. I don't want it to sort of peter out in terms of tension. So I was, yeah, I just thought, got to chuck a twist in there, keep it going, you know.
You need worst taste. That's what we need.
There's some bad stuff in here as well. It'll balance out. Okay, next up then.
This is very similar to the last couple, really. Exhibit F, Watch Dogs 2 on Xbox One, Â£4.89. I bought that on the 19th of March 2022.
So similar period, bought a Series X. I think there's another game that runs at 60 FPS like Unity does. We've talked about this before, but it's a very pleasant, good hang Watch Dogs game.
San Francisco captures a vibe of the city really, really well, or at least the pre-pandemic vibe of it. It's quite a bit dicier these days, unfortunately, from my experience. Still very nice, but you know, hey.
And yeah, so I think it course corrected Watch Dogs a little bit from the more serious first game that Tone that people weren't really into. The mechanics are pretty similar, though, but what do you think of this one, Matthew?
Yeah, I know this has got a lot of supporters. It is definitely sunnier and more obviously fun than the Terminal bad Kang, that is Aiden Pierce. I did find it very irritating, like I'm not going to lie.
I do hate the whole hacker group. I think the characters in this game are pretty rancid, but I know people who are younger than me who thought it was legitimately a cool, fun thing, so that's maybe just me showing my age, but this just wasn't aimed at me character-wise for sure.
You're talking about Jen, basically.
I mean, actually, that does factor into it. So, Jen, former editor of Edge, is really into this game and really advocates for it, and she's got excellent taste, you know? That's what makes me think, have I just missed something here?
But she isn't here as a guest lawyer.
I like the tension of you saying, actually, this game everyone says is good, I don't like it. That's what GameScore is all about.
Yeah, I did try with it. We did this as a cover on OXM, and I think we did part of the many reveal covers there were. And so, I had a little bit of buy-in.
I wanted it to be good because I didn't want to have put a bad game on our cover. I just, yeah, I don't know. I played more of Watch Dogs 1 than I did Watch Dogs 2, even though Watch Dogs 2 is definitely like, you know, a better mechanical hang and there's a lot more going on with like the, you can remote control the cars and things and that's fun.
I just, yeah, I just, I do find it quite obnoxious, so I am going to find it guilty.
Okay, that's fair enough.
Sorry.
No, that's fine. I think... I do remember those covers.
Didn't you show us the game before it was revealed as well? I have a vague memory of them coming into our office and presenting, saying what it was, and then they were doing, they did the covers, so they hit as soon as the game was revealed, basically. It's like an old school mag thing, which doesn't happen as much these days.
But yeah, that was good.
Yeah, it was actually quite a difficult cover in terms of, I think we had to do the interviews before we'd seen like a huge, like I had like a fact sheet. So it's one of those kind of like, here are some broad details. You can try and spin out some specifics by talking to someone, which is just a difficult way of going about it.
Like once you see a game, you're like, ah, shit, I should have asked this, this and this.
A funny thing about Watch Dogs as well is they are, they're like the ultimate kind of E3 demo games. Like they're just, they make such a good impression in like a, in an E3 demo. You see like the right amount of ideas.
You see like a little snapshot of the world. I just, this and Legion just had like impressive, impressive little snapshot showing. So just the art of the E3 demo, you know?
Yeah.
But that's, that's, that's, I would say that that extends to a lot of Ubisoft games in that a lot of their missions show off like a lot, you know, most of their missions are a good cross-section of the whole game. You know, they've all got a bit of movement, a bit of vehicle, a bit of combat, some of the systems. What they don't necessarily show you is that, like, that is maybe the extent of it and you're going to do it for 60 hours.
And all this stuff, which looks really bespoke in this mission is going to be repeated inside content over and over and over again. And now you do see people getting wise to that. And in the interviews after the demos, you often see the question asked, like, is this just this mission or is this something else, you know, like, is this a template, like, are we going to be doing like 20 of these base heists from Outlaws or whatever?
So people are getting wise to it. That has nothing to do with Watch Dogs 2, that's just an observation from the last week.
Okay, fair enough.
Yeah, I'm just going on a little nostalgic ramble as I put another tick in the guilty column.
Okay, Exhibit G, Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox 360, Â£4.59. This is the last of this little batch of purchases, I say. 20th of March, 2022.
So again, another game that runs very nicely on Series X. I think this also has the framerate boost. This was partly motivated by the fact that they brought out that Ninja Gaiden collection.
And I think people, I think it was argued that this version of 2 was actually superior to the version of 2 that was on there. And I think the same maybe went for the Ninja Gaiden Black as well. That ended up in my collection around a similar time.
And these are great games, but these are games I'd never really played before. Hands up, not played Ninja Gaiden 2 still. I did play a bunch of Ninja Gaiden Black for one of the episodes we did.
They're really good. I feel like I would love those. I should just take the time to just sit and play them.
That would be like a good thing for me to do. Maybe I'll just chuck one of those into the, into the, the poll. That might be good.
Did you, did you play these, Matthew?
Yeah, but I didn't get very far with them because they are just so hard. It's interesting, actually.
If you got black in the poll, that'd be good. I think that'd be good.
But these are like, what's, what's interesting at these is like, they're, they're hard before the difficulty conversation became incredibly one note around like Souls likes.
Yeah.
Which now represents difficulty in games, it feels.
Yeah. And the, yeah. The people who made these don't make these anymore.
They make Souls likes. No.
Yeah. The system, yeah. The system was, you know, the system was different.
Like just a really hard character action game. Yes. I mean, listen, it's, it's, it's a great game.
I don't get on particularly well with it in terms of, I suck at it, but you know, lots of people I respect who are better at these things love this game. Again, I don't mean to just put this on the heads of former Edge staffers, but I know Rich Stanton's big into this one. So like, you know, the ghost of Rich has entered the courtroom along with the ghost of Jen.
I don't know, ghost, they're not dead. Holograms. Thanks for making that clear.
I feel like I would normally punish the listeners for having not played it.
Yeah, you would. That's true. You would.
So, I mean, I don't want to feel like I'm kind of like putting on any kind of special treatment for you. I think it's, I just think it's, I think it's a shame that you've done this to yourself basically. You've bought a good game at a good price, but chosen not to play it.
I cannot be seen to like waver in the eyes of the listeners, so it's going to be a guilty from me.
I had better things to do in 2022, man. I had Tunic, Norco and God of War Ragnarok and no other games. So that was, that was what I was up to.
You'd rather be doing the fricking riding the mystic ox or whatever the fuck that thing was and picking magic pears than playing Ninja Gaiden 2.
Honestly, no. If I could go back, no, I don't think so. That's tough.
Ragnarok has definitely caught some strays since that original episode that we've done.
I think it has, now that it's settled a bit, it's interesting.
It's settled a bit, you mean in the takes sphere?
Well, you know, like, since a couple of years on, everyone's played it and digested it. And actually, I am pleased to see that that is, I think people are generally agreed that that slow riding, whatever that thing is that you ride, that that is bad. Like, people often mention it in comments under YouTube videos.
I've seen people be like, oh man, I love Ragnarok, but for that. And like, you know, I would replay it, but I know that there's that, like, stinking hour in the middle of it. And it's like, oh, good.
I'm glad that this is like, just agreed. It's a canonical, like, opinion.
There's just a few too many bits like that in that game. Just a bit too much like Odin walks me around his little Asgard town or whatever.
You just wasn't mentioning any reviews at the time, but now everyone's like, yeah, that bit sucks. So I think I'm just saying we were ahead of the curve.
We were. I think people just wanted something big and shiny to play in a year that had nothing else like it, really. So, you know, we all did our own thing to get through the end of the pandemic.
You know, I was saying the other day on Blue Sky, Matthew, which is where I deploy all my spiciest takes. I remember, I think I exited lockdown mentality somewhere between watching the series finale of Station Eleven and Will Smith slapping Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars. That's how I knew the pandemic was over.
I was like, OK, normal life can begin again now. It was sort of like it was like peace and war. You know what I mean?
Like Station Eleven was like the peace and then the slap was war. And those things together, I just achieved like perfect balance inside. Did you have that experience?
Do you remember when you broke out of lockdown? Was there anything that did it for you? Spider-Man?
No Way Home? Maybe?
Yeah, my Blorko tweet.
Oh, I love that. That was the end of the pandemic.
That was the end of the pandemic because like I was, yeah, I felt I felt seen again.
That's so good. OK, next exhibit then. Exhibit H.
Bayonetta 1 and 2 on Nintendo Switch. 49.99 on the 19th of April, 2022.
So this is how much they're sold new.
But basically, yes. But I think this has gone out of print by the time I bought it. Like they stopped.
I don't know if you noticed this with Switch games. There were some earlier Switch games you just can't get for like 39.99 anymore, which is basically the going rate for a Switch game, right? And this is among them.
I've not bought it. But like Links Awakening can no longer get for about 39 quid. That's just gone.
I don't think they manufacture any more of those. And the same is true for a couple of other games I'll talk about later. And also the Zelda Dynasty Warriors thing, the definitive edition of the one they did on Wii U.
That again is like you'll end up paying 50, 60 quid to get hold of that. So I think this is because Nintendo has made so many Switch games have been so successful. They can't be manufacturing all of them all the time, basically.
So that's maybe what happened here. I bought this specifically for 50 quid because it came with the Bayonetta 1 download code. I wanted both of them on Switch.
I do own both games on other formats. That's important to say. That's always part of the games court consideration.
However, Switch is the home of Bayonetta. You know, they belong there. It was a very nice little sort of like set that turned up.
I think this is justifiable for that reason. But what do you think, Judge?
Yeah, yeah. Remind me of what you think of Bayonetta 2 again.
I think it is inferior to the first game, but better than the third one, which I did get on with.
I mean, I could understand spending this much money if you were a big Bayonetta 2 head. So like if you were to, you know, maybe reconsider and agree that it's stronger of the pair.
Absolutely not. No way. And also it'll appease that one guy on our Discord.
He keeps banging on about it. Like it's a great stuff, like a political cause. Absolutely not.
I'm not having it.
Interesting. Not even if your life is on the line.
Oh shit. Are you going to be using one of your mega guilty tokens on this? That would be a bold swing, wouldn't it, for Bayonetta.
But I'm going to risk it on Bayonetta because I think these are too good for you to deem them like guilty. I'll come back to them at some point.
I mean, you know that I like them. I think Bayonetta 2 was really unlocked for me on Switch. Just because it runs so much better than it did on Wii U.
It looks amazing on the OLED screen. Disclaimer, I did have COVID when I was playing it.
You are an unreliable narrator.
I'm still not entirely sure if the experience I had with it is the experience most people will have with it. Like, if you used with my brain in some strange ways, I think I was Bayonetta for a while there.
An image I never want to think about again.
Imagine that.
You do have the glasses.
Yeah, that's basically it. She'd need so much more hair to cover me as an outfit.
I'm not going to be a baby about it. I can't possibly throw the excellent Bayonetta pair into the duo of games.
Why did you have to make it cursed?
I'm not guilty.
Beautiful pair of Bayonetta.
A beautiful pair of games.
For fuck's sake. It's like the spirit of 90s games mags.
That's huge games monster energy.
Oh dear. Okay. Not guilty then.
Well done. I don't even say well done to them. Me?
I don't know.
WarioWare gave me a thumbs up for that pair gag.
Okay. That's very much his wheelhouse, isn't it? Exhibit I.
Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE. Encore on Switch. Â£35.27.
22nd of April 2022. I'll be honest. Not played it.
Oddball RPG crossover between Shimbugami Tensei and Fire Emblem. But was it really? It didn't really look like either of them to me.
It was all about like giant concerts, pop concerts, which I would argue isn't really a key part of either of those worlds.
So a bit of a strange duck of a game this. I'm surprised even. I'm surprised this is on Switch, but Xenoblade Chronicles X isn't.
You know, that's a bit weird.
This is just huge Wii U misguided energy to this. Well, I say everyone, like to the weeby fans of Nintendo, which there are many, you know, that pitch of like the studio is merging these two things, like Fire Emblem and Shin Megami. You're like, wow, that's going to be that's going to be great, surely.
And then, you know, what it was was so very odd. Yeah. In terms of this sort of like, I'd say it's more Shin Megami than it is Fire Emblem for sure.
You know, being a kind of contemporary sort of Japan set thing.
You kind of want it to be Persona with with like a pop music star, but it's not really. It's not really that.
Difficult, this one. You haven't played it.
No.
It is a thing. I think it is like sort of desirable, though. It's such an odd oddity.
I don't hate the game, but like I've got to I've got to stick with the I've got to stick with my, you know, not having played it, I think is an issue here. So I am going to I am going to say guilty for that.
Okay. Guilty is right. Fair enough.
So I've currently got this 64.
Yeah, that sounds right. One, two, three, four, five. Sorry.
Yeah. 64. Yeah.
Sounds right.
I got a 64, but I've yet to use any of my mega tokens.
Mega tokens. Yeah. But I'm sure you'll get your chance, Matthew.
So next exhibit, again, in the very much the vein of the Xbox stuff I was talking about. Lego Lord of the Rings on Xbox 360, Â£9.95. This is on 27th of April, 2022, two days after my birthday.
Maybe I was having some feelings. But I bought this. One of the better Lego games from this generation.
Side note, I thought that Lego Horizon game looked really, really good. When I heard about it, I was like, I don't really see that. And then I watched the footage and I was like, that actually looks like great, great fun.
Yeah, yeah. So I'm pleased you agree there, Matthew. So yeah, this is also backwards compatible on a Series X.
What do you think, Matthew?
I wasn't expected to have passed judgment on Lego Lord of the Rings.
Sorry, I should have prepped you.
Yeah, no. Yeah, I like these games. I am sad that the era of mad productivity that gave us all these Lego games has come to an end.
Whatever happened with Traveller's Tales happened? Did they just overexert themselves? I don't know, because there was this period where it felt like they were making a couple of these, if not three of these a year, and they were all rammed with fan-pleasing stuff and affection and eye for detail as each other.
They are some of the best licensed games ever in terms of understanding and honoring the license and really delivering it in detail. This one, the fact that you could do the whole Lord of the Rings journey across that map was really impressive. I think this is a good one.
I'm fond of it. It's not guilty.
Okay, cool. I think this is a good little game. This is sort of like the apex of that particular period where they started doing more ambitious ones, slightly more open-worldy ones.
You can walk across Mordor basically. And they started incorporating the film's dialogue into the cut scenes as well. So that adds a little bit of presentational panache.
I did kind of prefer The Silent Era because I felt like they had to find funnier workarounds to convey some of the ideas.
I love the Lego indie cut scenes. They were some of the funniest ones, I thought. They were just really quite inventive and silly.
They really hit the right tone there. I think I'm kind of with you on that one. I think the rumour is that their next one is Harry Potter again.
They're going to do all of those. I'm less into Harry Potter. But the Star Wars one they did was too much of it for me to get through.
If you were a kid getting that game for Christmas, that's very much a treat of a game. It was a very expensive feeling thing. I think it sold mega well.
It is interesting, this Horizon one, because obviously it's nothing to do with Traveller's Tales. It's another studio taking a swing. It looks similar to what a Traveller's Tales Lego game would be in terms of the isometric camera view and doing it level by level, the co-op play, the smashing and building stuff.
I think it looks a little bit more like the Lego movie in terms of animation style. They've tried to capture some of that stop-motion vibe, which is cool. Rob, who I work with, has played it and said it looks genuinely amazing.
It looked photorealistic in a way that the Traveller's Tales games didn't. The Lego models have got scratches and blemishes on them that make them look like real plastic toys.
It was one of those reveals from SGF I wasn't really expecting to be excited by. It actually looked like something I would play.
The weird thing is, because it's a retelling of Horizon Zero Dawn, it means it's going to have presumably some of the bleak stuff from Horizon Lego Dawn in Lego format. Sort of Extinction of Humanity style stuff. I can't wait to see how they handle that.
A unique challenge for someone. I thought the lighting and stuff just looked... It kind of looked weirdly slightly nicer than Horizon does, in a way that I can't quite explain.
Maybe it's just a particular choice of art style and lighting, I don't know.
That's a hot take we're going to pump straight into your eyes.
Yeah, oh good. Well, if I'm found guilty. But for now, this is not guilty, so that's all good.
Exhibit K. This is going to be harder to defend. Dead or Alive 3 on Xbox, Â£3.98.
25th of May, 2022. Again, Series X backwards compatible. I think I briefly went through a phase of, I'm just going to buy every single backwards compatible thing that's on this platform.
And Dead or Alive 3 was a launch game for the original Xbox. It was very much a tech showcase for the time. Pretty good.
Then I replayed it last year with Jay Bayliss, a frequent guest to show, and it was a bit of a tough hang. And these games generally have a bit of like, you know, the first kind of like boobage energy. We know what the deal is with them, so it's not ideal.
Wario, another thumbs up from Wario.
Again, I don't want endorsements from that guy, but that's unfortunate. I didn't buy this for perverted purposes. I bought it for game preservation, damn it.
I can't remember why I bought this. What are your thoughts, Judge?
I mean, that is such a... I was kind of fine with it until that last little statement.
It just made it sound so desperate. It's definitely not worthy of the dreaded 5 token, but I think you yourself, by admitting that it's not all that to play... I'm not into any fighting game really, but the couple of times I have played Dead or Alive, it really wasn't for me.
I'd be more up for playing that volleyball game, to be honest.
What, because Margaret said it was good?
Yeah, that's basically like giving that game a pass now.
Another game for you to play when the fucking plumber comes around or whatever.
Yeah, let's say no.
Okay, so guilty.
Yeah.
Okay, all right, Exhibit L. Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time on the original Xbox. Oh, sorry, not in Matthew Castle Island.
Prince of Persia, The Sands Of on Xbox. Â£6.77, 24th of May, 2022. Again, backwards compatible, an all-time classic, never owned it.
Haven't played it since then, I must admit. Do intend to play it at some point though. I mean, we made an episode on Beyond Good and Evil.
I don't think it's out of the question that we'll play Sands of Time. Side note, the 2026 thing did make me laugh at the Ubisoft conference. That's a game that is perpetually, the remake of this is perpetually out of grasp.
That did make me chuckle.
They showed what looked like a finished game like three or four years ago. How bad has it gone that they've had gone, oh, fuck it, let's just go back, start again.
But what do you think of this one, Matthew?
I mean, you haven't played it, big black mark against it for sure. But I do, for some reason, I believe you more that you will play this at some point. You know, there is definitely Prince of Persia ahead of us in the podcast feature.
So, you know, I can kind of give it a pass on those grounds. Yeah, it's a really good game. I think it still holds up.
I replayed it in the last five years. How did I replay it? What did I replay on?
I can't even remember what I played on. But maybe it was something an older boy told me about. I don't know.
But not that we have the concept of older boys on Castle Island.
Just boys.
Yes, I mean, come on, Prince of Persia. It's great. A game with real character.
I like almost one which a bit like Beyond Good and Evil has a kind of slight timelessness to its art style to the point where you're like, do you really need to remake this? If anything, with this second remake that they've been at, we've gone back to the drawing board, it feels like they're going to take more of a hammer to it rather than just doing a visual pass. It feels like it might end up being a bit more like the Dead Space remake that EA did, like actually change some of it and maybe make the castle feel a bit more open rather than being just set levels, improve the combat.
So I'm way more interested in how they're talking about that remake now. Not that that has any bearing on this purchase, but if they do remake it and change it, this game will still have its value as the original version of it, the original kind of vision for it. So yes, it's fine.
Okay, good. Not guilty then. Excellent.
Yeah, I enjoyed that whole Prince of Persia bit of that showcase, the rogue Prince of Persia or whatever it's called. When that shapes up into a full thing, I'll be well up for that. That was a lovely visual style.
So I love seeing that series out in the wild. So that's good. Exhibit M.
Metal Gear Acid 2 on PSP Â£13.19. This is just the UMD. This is a bit more expensive to get with the case.
12th of July, 2022. I did play a bit of it on my PSP. It came up recently on the draft.
I didn't pick it, obviously. Boohoo. But yes, this was in the days, I think, before I was an older boy showed me how to emulate all PSP games on the Steam Deck.
And in general, it's like a much improved sequel to the original Metal Gear Acid. Nice art style, more cards, turn-based sort of like card game action. You know, has the spirit of Metal Gear in the sort of visuals and the audio.
A really nice showcase of what the PSP can do with visuals that really pop in the way that some of the more realistic 3D games on that platform do not necessarily stand the test of time. I think this does. A bit of a curio now for Metal Gear fans.
I think people want to see us on one of the collections. I don't think they will for the simple reason of it will, they'll have to probably up-res the cards a little bit and that would be quite a lot of a bit of a significant art pass and I don't think that they'd do it for acid, but hey, prove me wrong. In any case, this game still exists, you can go out and play it via various means, but PSP wanted it on there.
A true classic of the platform, as evidenced by the draft voting against me, Matthew.
Yes. I definitely take the point about Kojima & Co. kind of really going all in on their PSP games, delivering really big, interesting things.
I haven't played this myself. I definitely do want to play it. I think this is good.
I think this is a sound purchase. I've not got a problem with it.
OK, great. In which case, yeah, another low stakes purchase. Not guilty.
Good stuff. But things are about to hot up a little bit, Matthew. So I got Exhibit N, The Saboteur on Xbox 360, 599, 27th of August, 2022.
Not sure why I bought this at the time. I'm not sure why, actually, I don't own my original copy of it. Maybe I gave it to my dad.
I don't know. But as people who listen to podcasts a lot know, my dad likes this game. Not for salacious reasons, allegedly.
As far as I know, he doesn't own the GBS DLC that was available alongside this. He merely enjoys it for the World War II content, which is his whole deal. So yes, black and white and red, open world, World War II shooter, action-adventure-y thing from Pandemic, their last game, before the studio was closed by EA at the end of 2009.
That was unfortunate. They were previously the Star Wars Battlefront Studio, made two great ones in that series in two years. They were bangers, mercenaries, games are pretty decent as well.
So yeah, that was a long time ago, but The Saboteur was kind of like a slightly weird cult classic to go out on. It didn't sell mega well. 2009 is also the year of Assassin's Creed II.
By comparison, this wasn't quite as shiny or as impressive as that, despite having some similarities in terms of game type. But I think it is sort of like an interesting object of fascination from the 360 era for its visual style and the unusual idea of being a freedom fighter in World War II Paris. That's quite a cool notion, I think.
So yeah, I think owning this is perfectly fine, even if it's not backwards compatible. But what does the judge think?
I don't know. I mean, like, I was desperately scrambling for, like, a reason to give this the five token, just because I think it would be funny, given the Roberts back history with this game.
I don't really, but like, I know it's, you know, it is considered a cult classic by some, thus cult classic, I guess. And it has its cheerleaders. I've just never really bought it.
I'm from like very limited experience, which I think is probably like, you know, playing this on a TV at lunchtime in the office because Gamesmaster had it on. I don't know. It's fair.
It's just what struck me as like incredibly average. That's why it's funny that your dad likes it. Like the joke is diminished if we're like, yeah, this is like legit.
And even on those grounds, I'm going to say guilty, not a five token, but I'm going to say guilty in that, like, your whole dad's relationship with this game is funnier if in Back Page: lore it is a lesser game. So I'm going to uphold the sanctity of the joke.
That makes sense. I don't think it made the list on Back Page: Best Games of 2009 episode. I don't think it came up.
I think it came up, but I don't think it was in the list. Let's see. Did I pick it before I say that?
Is this going to backfire? No, I didn't. There were so many good games.
I've seen some people say, oh, it's one of those sevens. It's one of those sevens that comes up that I don't really buy. A bit like Alpha Primal.
Where I'm like, is it though?
I do agree with this. I found it quite hard to love when I played it. I thought it was sort of like, the visual style was kind of the most striking thing about it.
Then everything beneath that is just a little bit mediocre.
I think you just wanted to earn your dad's respect.
Honestly, I don't feel the need to work that hard to do that. It's not something I'm that good for the battle.
Working hard, spending five pounds on a copy of The Saboteur.
I spent on his respect what I deemed it worth, basically. That's not true. Exhibit O then is Call of Duty 2 on Xbox 360, Â£5.99, 27th of August, 2022, same day as The Saboteur.
So you've got kind of like a duff World War II game and mega World War II game. I played this loads at the time. I played this a bit since then.
I think this was for the Excel episode of Backwards Compatible Games. This came up around that time. So you like this game too?
This is the game that made you academically underachieve, Matthew. So how do you feel about it now in this context?
I mean, it's a key Castle text. Admittedly, I only really enjoy it if it is being played to the soundtrack of The Best of Danny Elfman, Volume 2.
For fuck's sake, fucking hell.
So did you buy that pre-owned also?
You know what? I didn't, I'll be honest. I could have dialed it up on Spotify, I guess, but I chose not to do that either.
So that's tough.
Yeah, it's always like, it's all a risk going back. The idea of buying launch games, you know, you're going back as far as you can in a console's life and often they're a bit ropey, but I remember this being good and quite ahead of its time and, you know, the local multiplayer is excellent. So, you know, I think I'm going to give this a pass.
I'm going to give this a pass on the grounds that maybe one day we boot it up for some split-screen multiplayer. Yeah, that'd be fun.
Is it split-screen co-op, then, or is it just...
I don't know if there's a co-op campaign. We played the multiplayer split-screen, like, gold, you know. It's the last...
Oh, right. It's that kind of split-screen.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's got, like, yeah, we played this, like, we played Goldeneye, four-player split-screen.
Damn. Yeah, let's get Catherine involved.
Yeah, hide behind that little piano in fucking Carrot Town.
Okay, well, I'm pleased this is not guilty. I think that was an easy one anyway. That was gonna be...
Yeah, I mean, I wasn't gonna, like, that's, like... I can't betray my beloved Call of Duty 2.
But you can betray my next exhibit, which is P. Battle Station specific on Xbox 360, five pounds. I don't know why I bought this.
28th of August, 2022. I've not played it. Again, maybe it's just like, I need to just own every single backwards compatible game that they've made for reasons.
I don't have any real desire to play this either. I just don't know what happened. This is just a weird blip.
Was I having a rough summer? Possibly. I don't know.
I had to go to Gamescom that year. I will think I was maybe debilitatingly ill after Gamescom 2022. Perhaps that was part of what was going on here, but I can't justify it in any way, Matthew.
Should we say guilty and move on?
Let's say guilty and let's say five tokens guilty. Because you're yourself, you see. You haven't played it.
You didn't really want it. You don't really like it. No, come on.
All I'll say is don't waste all of your mega guilty tokens before we get to the end of this, because we are out now of the territory. We've got one more, but we're almost out of the territory of 360 games I bought that are backwards compatible. From here, it gets a little bit stranger, I would say.
A little bit, yeah, it gets good, then it gets bad, then it gets worse, then it gets good again.
Well, I'm raising the stakes. I've currently got us on 11 guilty, nine not guilty.
Is that correct? Yeah, I haven't done the maths, but let's assume that's correct, I believe you. Because you have maths in your DNA, as previously established on another episode.
Did we talk about that?
Yeah, you talked about how you've got... It made me wonder about nature versus nurture and whether I was always doomed to be bad at maths because my parents weren't good at it. I thought about that for about two weeks.
That was after, I think, Best Games of 2003 or something.
And why aren't you better at the clarinet?
Well, I don't know if my dad's good at the clarinet. He just plays it. He's the jack of all trades, my dad.
And I'm the jack of no trades. Like, podcasting and writing, basically all I can do.
You've got those fine clarinet playing lips.
Okay, enough about that. Exhibit Q. Here we go.
Steel Battalion on Xbox. Comes with both games that were released for the original Xbox.
Fucking hell.
21st of May, 2023. I bought this as kind of a dare, because I think I said, maybe I dared myself, but I was like, if the Patreon hits Â£1000 a month, I will buy myself Steel Battalion. This is the other key thing to say about this era onwards.
The Patreon exists, and it maybe unlocks a tier of purchase that I hadn't previously dabbled with that much. So bear that in mind for the horrors to come. But Steel Battalion is the first one.
No, I've not played it. Yes, I will play it eventually. But I don't have a good solution for getting my Xbox plugged into my HDTV at the moment.
That's the main barrier here. So it's in a giant box in my cupboard. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, having not played it and the difficulty of playing it, definitely not great. But also this is just, you know, on a kind of nostalgia level, this is tied to, you know, it was enabled by the Patreon and that was a nice, exciting thing. I do believe that we will one day do a Patreon episode on this, or an episode on this.
Like, it's not something I would ever buy, but I am glad that someone I know has it so that I can one day experience it. So it would be pretty kind of churish of me to give you a guilty for this. It's just a nice thing.
I'd say this is part of Back Page: lore, and if you'll forgive me for being smug, our moderate success story. So I think this is good.
Yeah, there's no way I would have bought it without the Patreon.
That's the thing.
Yeah, it was like, in some ways, I think the purchases I've made in the podcast, I think I've been fairly good at investing these purchases back into the episodes that we've made. Certainly the Dreamcast was evidence of that.
I mean, I have pumped no money into anything in front of us, the podcast.
You've just got a bank of obscure DS games, and you can just break one of those out if things are looking a bit dicey for you. You know what I've got nothing to talk about? You know what we've not talked about for a while?
Contact on DS, and then you're away. So yeah, you're fine. Okay, good, so not guilty, then.
Good.
I spend it on sandwiches. That's what I spend my Patreon money on, which does feed the podcast.
It does. This is also before I was, I would say, very familiar with taxes and how that works. Which I now understand a little bit more, and that's maybe I'm also a little bit more like, I should probably just save for a house now, dog.
So I've been spending more of my Patreon money on that, to be honest. But yeah, little preposterous purchase here or there, doesn't go amiss. Here's something that I think is fairly safe.
Apollo Justice Ace Attorney on Nintendo DS 2399, 2nd of September 2023. That's a good price for this, like the DS Phoenix Wright games. There's actually quite a lot of fake ones on the market.
I didn't realize it was a bit of a lightning rod for this. DS, I think you and I are still aligned on DS being the definitive place to enjoy these games. I don't know if that's changed since the recent sort of Ace Attorney 2nd collection they did on Switch, Matthew, but pretty sure that Apollo Justice in particular is meant to be on DS.
I have not played this only because I've still not got through Trials and Tribulations, which I will finish one day. It's a long-running project for me, but what do you think of this one?
Yeah, I think this is okay, on the grounds of it being the DS game. I don't know if it's just ground me down or if it's just because it is the option which is readily available now, but the newer HD art, I've just seen it enough now that it worries me less. I think those newer versions of the newer collections, as a value proposition, they're just so good.
Do I prefer the look of the original sprites? Yes, of course, but I'm not gonna... I would probably replay the newer versions when I next replay them.
In fact, I have played a chunk of Apollo Justice since the second trilogy was re-released. And it's also the game I probably wobble on the most. I think it was quite low down in my rankings when we did the Ace Attorney episode, but I sometimes think, oh, do I actually like this a little bit more than I remember?
Some of the cases are pretty good. I don't know. I think I've gotten over the shock of different characters.
I still think the third case is a real pain in the ass in it, which you'll discover for yourself when you one day play this.
When I'm 45 years old, yep.
When you're 45 years old, it plays a terrible song about 20 times in the case that you have to keep listening to this terrible song because it's got clues in it. That really sucks. But the other cases in this and the music, I really like.
So, yeah, yeah. I'm okay with this one.
Okay, good. Shotgaru.
Ace Attorney, given the pass.
And verified on reddit that this is the real deal, so it wasn't scammed by some lad with a lorry. So that's good.
I've currently got it as 11 all.
Well, there you go. There's some spicy stuff to come. This is a good one.
exhibitS, a Wendon 1 and 2 on DS, Â£49.53. This is the 15th of August, 2023. I believe this is around the DS draft time, Matthew.
So it's a bit of a lightning rod for me picking up some stuff. In general, my DS collection is pretty excellent. There's some stuff I'll just never end up with on there, like Time Hollow, for example.
That's the sort of thing that is just too expensive for me to buy, really, and I just don't think I'll get enough joy out of it. But generally speaking, I've ticked a lot of different DS boxes. I've got something like 70, 80 DS games, so it's sizable.
And yeah, they are cool things to own. It's still fun to pop those into their 3DS and just have a go on them. So, a Wendon, this was a good purchase.
I didn't play the second one, but I did play the first one for the DS draft because Hadley B. Agents really liked it, but always heard the music was better in a Wendon original Japanese soundtrack, you know, pop music, Japanese pop music. Played it, they were correct.
It's really, really good. It's otherwise the same game, just tapping drums on the DSM screen. This is a great price for this as well.
You're talking about importing games that are a little bit collectible now as well. To get both of them together, again, verified these were legitimate, so I was quite happy with that. Yeah, I think these were like great, sort of like near final additions to the DS collection.
Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, classic picks and I know that you've brought them up several times over the course of doing the podcast, so I know that they've kind of legit registered with you, which is a key part of this. Yeah, they're great games. So much better than League of Legends, I think.
Yeah, they're just as covered as the stuff.
Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, absolutely easy. Probably one of the easiest ones you've brought today.
Yeah, yeah. Exhibit T. I almost didn't include this because I do regret it slightly, but also I just thought this is the one where I want to say to the listeners, I don't think that money grows on trees, right?
And I don't think that it's okay that I did this. I just want to say that in advance, right? Because I did buy Pokemon Platinum on DS for $89.99.
On the 26th of August, 2023. Like I said, it was good to hold your Mega Guilty tokens back, Matthew. Why did I buy it?
So this is one of the most sought after DS games on there. It's a special... It's basically like the Pokemon Yellow of Diamond and Pearl that they did.
No, I have not played it, regrettably. Did I buy it to like sort of basically gloat to my brother? Possibly a bit of that.
I don't know what... This is like the most unjustifiable purchase here because I know that it's kind of bullshit. But I think it was also a little bit of like just looking at contemporary Pokemon games, not really being my thing.
I can't... You know what? I can't justify it.
Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, I have actually played this one because I had to play this on NGamer. I may have even reviewed it, which would be grotesque, if true. But I've recalled writing about it.
It's got that terrible looking thing on the front cover. It looks like a sort of metallic looking kind of caterpillar with sort of spikes coming out of its back.
Do you know what the game does have though? Nice art style.
Does it?
Yeah, it's like the last 2D one before they go 3D.
I'm just looking at pictures of it, see if it inspires me or reminds me of what I thought about it at the time.
The listeners are going, let him cook basically about you right now.
I feel like a broken record when it comes to Pokemon. Everyone knows that I don't dig it. I find it quite infantile, so the idea of spending 90 quid on it I think is truly grotesque.
This is the worst one, I would say, of all the ones I've got.
Was it HeartGold, SoulSilver, which came with the pedometer?
Yeah, I don't have the pedometer, but I do own HeartGold.
That's the kind of thing where if you spent 90 quid on it, it has a novelty value and there's something quite specific about it that I would have been less upset by.
It's funny because I think these ones all went up in value when the Pokemon Go took off in 2015 or 2016, or whatever it was. So they are all out of control. Every single one of them goes above retail price, basically.
You can say guilty.
You should make a guilty note, man. There was such a shrug around this generation on NGamer. Coming and joining the magazine, you thought, oh, it would be interesting to kind of like, you know, this has never been something I've been into.
It would be interesting to talk to people about that and hear the opinion from the inside. And I think Diamond and Pearl was reviewed in one of the earlier issues of NGamer and got like 78 or something. And it was just like, eh, this generation's like, eh.
And that was just the overwhelming vibe. So the idea of like paying 90 quid for it, I just, yeah. I played it and I don't remember anything about it.
That's the real thing. Ignoring the Pokemon at all, like I literally cannot remember a thing about this game. Looking at it.
Apart from the box art.
Apart from the box art and that terrible, is it Giratina? Is that what it's called?
Something like that, yeah. I think this generation of Pokemon games did sell really well, because it was the DS and these were like the good DS times.
The only bit of this story I enjoy is you buying it slightly to annoy your brother, or like spite your brother or rub his face in it.
That's funny.
That's the Sam Roberts I know and love.
He was quite annoyed. He was like, why do you own this, basically? It was a good time, I would say.
Yeah, but I'm not going to go five token on this, because it's perfectly playable and I imagine you could probably sell it for the same amount now, right? It's a no from me, dog.
Yeah, fair enough. One Guilty is kind of considered a net gain, really, for this one, I think.
That is a lot of money.
It's like when, again, I wouldn't have done this pre-Patreon. I think after I bought it, I was like, that was too much.
If you really wanted to play it, I would have just given you my copy.
Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I don't want to ever make this your problem, you know what I mean?
Except for all these episodes, basically. Well, we changed tack now.
Maybe I'll sell my copy if it's worth that much.
Yeah, I mean, if it's legit, then it will sell. That's more money for Deliveroo, so fill your boots, Matthew. Or if you want, I can just put you in touch with my brother, and you can rub it in his face.
Yeah, tag team.
Pint some over.
Yeah, Pokemon fans love that shit, don't they? Okay, Exhibit U. Call of Duty Infinite Warfare on Xbox One.
Â£3.74, 21st September 2023. We talked about this before. We did tout doing a sort of like two giant men play on this one, but it was kind of a bit of a lark.
But it's a very shiny, cool sci-fi game that was just not loved by its audience of people who just like, sort of like modern warfare. That's very much the vibe of COD, the COD that is very, very popular. So this was not beloved by that community.
However, I think if this was not Call of Duty, if this was like an original sci-fi shooter, it would have gone down pretty well. Like the sort of like the look of it, the ship designs, the John Snow of it all. I think all of that would have gone down quite well.
The fact it's COD is actually the, it's almost like baggage for like something that could have been a bit of its own offshoot. If it was just called Infinite Warfare, that was the name of the game. I think people would have dug it.
What do you think, Matthew, for this one?
Yeah, I'm quite fond of this. I may be, I've just been Jeremy Peel-Pilled, Jeremy Peeled, Jeremy Bealed on this one. But what I did like was, you know, a team with one of the craziest budgets ever kind of throwing that budget behind.
Well, let's do a load of crazy sci-fi planets and space instead of war zones that you're very familiar with and you see you every day on the news and it feels a bit like grim and ugly. Like this one isn't like compromising anyway in that sense. Like it's probably one of the least morally murky Call of Duty's you can enjoy because it's just a load of made up space nonsense.
So, yeah, it's a pretty good campaign. I like this one. I thought this was okay.
I mean, I'm talking about it purely as a single player experience. I've like no idea what was going on multiplayer with this one. And for three quid, it's like a lot of bang for your buck.
I'll definitely play this at some point as well. I'll play this and talk about it on the pod. Like I promise to listeners that will happen at some point.
Put that in the poll.
Yeah, that actually might be a good shout.
I would happily replay that game.
Yeah. That might be the one I chuck in there then. Okay, good.
That will not get a vote. Imagine our Patreons picking Call of Duty Infinite Warfare over Shenmue.
Yeah, it's destined to get like 5% that one, isn't it? Okay. Exhibit V, Driver San Francisco and Xbox 360 again, talking of Jeremy Peele, Pilled.
Â£8.23, 26th of September, 2023. Not played it. Don't know what prompted this other than, again, just hoarding backwards compatible stuff.
But I want to play it at some point. It's one of those 360-era curios that is sort of worthy of discussion, has come up on the pod when Jeremy's come on. That was good fun.
What do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, and I feel like I can't dunk on this one. Not that I would. I don't intend to dunk on this one.
I wouldn't dunk on this anyone, but I especially can't, because I know it's a favourite of both Jeremy Peele and worked on by friend of the show, Jamie Smith, who told us about making achievements for this game.
It's a good episode.
Yeah, that was a great episode.
There's a kind of sadness around these things, that this sort of strand hasn't continued, that Ubisoft's driving output is all a little bit the crew, or variations of the crew, which really don't do it for me. I mean, technically it should be guilty, because you haven't played it, but again, I believe that you will, and I feel like I would be stepping on the toes of too many friends of the podcast to be an asshole about it, so let's say you're not guilty.
Sounds good. The key thing to underline as well with these exhibits generally is we're up to about 20-something purchasers, and this spans the length of two years, basically, so if you keep that in mind, it's not too bad. It's not like I'm buying one of these things a week.
It's a bit more like once a month I might dip in, that sort of thing. The one thing I didn't include that I almost did is I was scrolling through and saw a purchase of Anarchy Reigns where the purchase was cancelled because they never sent it to me, Anarchy Reigns on PS3, and that would have been a really good one to discuss, but unfortunately I never received it, therefore it cannot be litigated in Judge Castle's courtroom. Boatroar, I just wanted to remind people that Sean Connery was in the jury there.
Okay, into the flames we go. Exhibit W, Sega Saturn modded with some bullshit to make it play games off of an SD card, and then I bought a little cable for it as well to make it look nice and HD on my TV. Then it didn't work properly, and like I say, the seller on Facebook Marketplace mysteriously disappeared.
I do know where his house is, but I'm not going to go round there, obviously. But this was Â£330 on the 20th of January, 2024. I can't remember, oh, that was it.
The Ashley Day Sega episode motivated this preposterous purchase. I've since sent it away to be repaired. It has come back.
I've not tested it to see if it works, but the disappointment of trying to boot up burning rangers and then it just kicking me back to a venue was quite disappointing, I must say. So this feels like a bit of a dud so far, but it might still pay off. Thoughts, Matthew?
Yeah, well, we're judging on what it's done so far and not, like, potential. That's how trials work. You're not on trial for, like, the murders you might do in the future.
It's the murder you didn't do in the past.
Yeah, fair enough.
So, I mean, no. Like, the Dreamcast, and maybe we'll get to that, is, you know, that's one thing. We've played it, we've had fun, we've got something out of it.
Currently, this has been a bust. I also enjoyed that Ashley Day episode, not to the length that I would had any desire to buy one of these things. Like, I'm absolutely fine there being chunks of gaming history that I just didn't interact with at the time and probably won't.
You know, I would prefer to move forwards. I just don't have time to wallow. Wallow in the past.
Not that you can either, because it doesn't work. So, guilty.
Okay, that's fair enough, Matthew. And at least you didn't spend your five guilty tokens on it.
No, because I can understand where you were coming from. If it worked, big if. Maybe it would be a different story.
But like, right now...
This is even more cursed as well, because it's a Japanese one. It requires a step-down converter.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Both these Sega purchases... There was so much accoutrement bullshit that ended up racking up the car. So it was quite annoyed at the end of it.
Okay. It has such echoes of like... You know, I think of the Wii U as too complicated, because it requires two plugs.
But that's nothing compared to all the stuff you've had to buy and extra things and new pads. That was cursed when you had the Dreamcast and you had that new controller, which linked up for some way.
That was a good controller.
It is a good controller, but just the notion of having to buy something now to play something from then and then these little machines that you plugged the UMDs into...
It ends up looking like a blade-runnery workshop. There's wires everywhere and all this weird plastic shit.
It's like when you buy a train set for Christmas, basically. It's like fucking 90 different bits. When you've got to put it away, you're like, I'm not getting this out for three more years.
It wasn't worth it kind of thing. There's a bit of that to it. But I will test the Saturn today and see if it works.
So if it does, it has every single key Saturn text on there. And there's potential for a Saturn roulette episode of it, if it does function. But again, do you want all that shit in your living room?
To be decided. OK, then that's guilty. So Exhibit X is the Sega Dreamcast, as mentioned and discussed on the Excel episode, the Dreamcast roulette.
I think people agree was pretty good. There's Â£399.99. It's an expensive thing.
26th of January, 2024. You've played it. You've gotten some joy out of this, Matthew.
We were both baffled by some of the creative choices made in D2 as well. That was also quite amusing. Virtua Tennis was fucking mega highlight.
The second one's even better, by the way. Has William Sisters in it, if that sells you on it. So, yes, do you think this is a better purchase than the Saturn for that reason?
Yes. I mean, purely for the choo-choo rocket of it, that was just the hardest I've laughed playing a game this year, for sure.
We've got to play a game, man. We've got to get Catherine involved.
That was really good. That's why I maybe feel a bit shitty about the Saturn, because the Saturn could be that. I don't think the Saturn has anything quite like that, to the best of my knowledge.
No, Virtua Fighter isn't quite going to tick the box in the same way.
Not at all. I have no desire to play that. I look forward to playing that on the Saturn Ruler episode.
Dreamcast was fun. I do think it was chaotic. I understand the price of it and the way it works.
You don't have to buy loads of extra games and everything. It kind of balances out somewhat.
Dreamcast and Saturn games are so expensive generally as well. It'll set you back to get some of the really tasty ones.
I couldn't possibly say guilty just because of Choo Choo Rocket. That was amazing. I wish I had a button that could trigger Cat Mania in this house, in this courtroom.
Just play that demented music. That would be amazing.
Some of the sounds coming out of your TV. The most cursed things I've ever heard. Okay, good.
That balances out, I think. One guilty console, not guilty console. Again, I know those are very expensive, but the Patreon, it was a bit of an investment in the podcast.
I knew they'd come up at some point. I tried to make only one or two purchases like that in a calendar year, just to not overdo it. It was Steel Battalion in 2023, and then these this year.
That's when the newspapers were like, these youngsters can't afford to buy a house because they're all eating too much avocado. It's actually because they're buying chips, Satins and Dreamcasts.
So, Exhibit Y, The World Ends With You, final remix on Nintendo Switch, 3699, 11th of March, 2024. This is a game I've played before on DS, and I thought, I read there's an extra chapter in this that's not in the DS version, and bought it, and then read online that people were saying, well, this is far inferior to the DS one as an experience, and I was like, oh, that's a bummer. But kind of something I wanted in my Switch collection anyway.
So there's a little bit of like having it and a little bit of like, do I want to go back and play it at some point? But what do you think, Matthew? Does this just belong on DS?
Is this a duff purchase?
Yeah, I thought this was like quite a compromised version, like it doesn't have the same, quite the same combat system. Isn't this like a remake of the version when they basically turn it into an iOS game?
Yeah, I think it kind of is.
Yeah, I think this is a game that really did only ever make sense on the DS. And I think I haven't played this version on Switch, but I did play a bit of the iOS version. It was just instantly like noped out of it.
The sequel, because the sequel was made without the dual screens in mind, it has, you know, a slightly different, you know, that I don't have a problem with, even though it is different to the DS game, Neo. But this one, yeah, it just feels, it just feels like buying it for full price as well, just a slightly different time. No, come on, no.
No, come on. Okay, well, that was actually surprised by that. I thought you might have been like, well, I get the urge to have it on Switch, etc.
No, I mean, yeah, there is that. But, you know, I don't have, like, I'm not big into like, oh, you must have an amazing collection of all these boxes or you need all these things. I just don't know if it would make the list of things you need on Switch.
The thing I'm starting to learn about, like, trying to keep hold of copies of games or make sure you've always got them on a contemporary platform is that life is not that long. So, like, I'm already, like, you know, 36. I've only got probably, like, double this plus a little bit more left to sort of left on the clock.
So, and that's if life expectancy doesn't dip in the UK significantly over the next few decades, I think it probably will. So, with all that in mind, I'm like, well, how important is it that I have a copy of everything? Like, when will I, like, the last 10 years, how much time did I have to replay things?
It was actually, like, fairly lean, relatively speaking. I'm starting to come around to that mentality a bit with games collecting, you know?
I was just thinking, especially with games that came out, like, new when you were into games, I think if you really wanted to play it and were destined to play it, you probably just would have played it then. This idea of, like, oh, I must have it 10 years later, I don't really get that, you know? I get, oh, it came out before I was interested in games, so I'm going back and exploring, which is maybe more the case of, like, the Saturn, say.
But for a game like this, I'm like, is that really a gap that you need to fill in? Like, was there ever really a gap there? I don't know.
Well, I did play the original. I did like the original. I didn't finish it, but I did play loads of it.
No, no, I'm not. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. But then when this other version comes out, it wasn't like you were counting down the days to The World Ends With You remix on Switch, or you would have bought it then.
No. It just made me cover the DS one a little bit more. Maybe that was a duff purchase.
Okay, thank you. Thanks, George. We're near the end here.
Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition on Switch, $6.99, 22nd of March, 2024. I thought he owned this, but apparently not. This was another one that I think actually, this and the next one, I think I'd read on Reddit that they stopped manufacturing these, so the prices were about to go up, and I was like, right, fuck, I better get a copy of this just in.
This was a Wii game, obviously, an RPG that Matthew is very fond of, and they did a Switch version where they added some extra episode to it, I believe, and it looks a lot nicer as well. It's a full remake, so I don't think it's that bad for the price, but what do you think, Judge? Can you possibly say guilty to Xenoblade Chronicles?
I do find these newer games which you bought because they are about to become expensive, you sort of bought them for roughly what they were being sold for new, so they are slightly confusing to me as pre-owned purchases, but I do get the logic. Yeah, I'm not going to chuck Xenoblade in the bin. It is great.
I would feel a bit more confident if I believed you were going to pile 100 hours into this one day and come out loving it. I just feel like deep down you're not destined to be a huge Xenoblade head.
Yeah, it does make me wonder. Would it have happened by now?
Yeah, I think it probably would have, and I think maybe there was room in my heart for Xenoblade because I don't have an established JRPG relationship that you do with Final Fantasy, say, and maybe there is just room for only one, or the first time you play... I've said it before, Xenoblade was the first time I poured hundreds of hours into a JRPG, so that's why it's more meaningful to me. But it is a great version, has the original music, the reorchestrated music, which is absolutely fantastic, that extra episode.
I mean, it's a really good, definitive edition. I think they pulled out all the stops. So, yes, it is good.
I'm not putting in, that's not guilty.
Okay, good. All right, then next one is Fire Emblem Three Houses, which is Â£41.99, 24th of March, 2024.
I get it, it's confusing. Buying these new games for new game prices.
It's not new though, it's like five years old now, six years old. The Switch has just been around for ages and ages, you know.
It's probably what it's worth, right? You know, these games are like...
Does this lose points for being performatively horny, Matthew, or the people who are performatively horny who like it?
Not really, because that's just the audience, you know. Maybe it courts that audience and should be punished for that, but it's not its fault that its audience is quite as irritating as it is. I still think it's sad that it sort of overshadows Engage a little bit, which I really liked.
Yeah, it's a cool game.
Good Fire Emblem, another great Switch game. Price seems acceptable, and it's not a very spicy take that this is not guilty, but I'm not offended by it. I guess what I'm surprised by is that it is as old as that.
Like in my head, this is like all Switch games are like two years old, but I know they're not.
That is the thing. There's maybe a little bit of a sort of like current in the background here. I have been hoarding Switch games a little bit to sort of build a very robust collection of them.
So I do think that once the successor comes along, they probably will just stop making a lot of these games, and then the prices of them will just shoot up because Nintendo games always climb in value. They just do. So there's a little bit of like this is the first Nintendo platform that's been along where I've had like disposable income as an adult, and I've just been like, you know what?
I'm going to get all of these games in real time, rather than getting them like I have on DS, piecemeal for ridiculous prices. So that's been a bit of a project I've had. I think I've got most of the ones I want now.
The ones that are left for me to purchase are, like I say, can I be bothered with the sort of like Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition? I'm not sure. Or things like Super Mario Bros.
Wii, the Wii U one. I'm not sure if I can really be bothered to get that. These are the ones I've left to weigh up.
Well, that Princess Peach game that came out, not really sure, you know.
But then probably everyone's thinking like that. So those probably are the ones which will end up being slightly harder to find.
Yeah, that is true.
That's the thing. You almost want to kind of zig where everyone else sags, because it's the regret of not buying at the time that drives these things up. It's not the worthy games that are worth more.
It's just not. I'm not sure I can bring it in me to like buy a Detective Pikachu 2. You know what I mean?
I'm not sure that's where I'm at.
Just keep it shrink wrapped.
Exactly. It's just not. Yeah, I still want to make sure I have like good games in my collection, rather than sort of like Curio is in a slightly ass.
Well, la-dee-da.
Good thing to say at the end of a 28-entry games court episode. But yeah. Okay.
So that's not guilty as well, then, Matthew, right?
Yes.
Right. Last one, then. This is kind of one of my frivolous purchases I've made in Japan.
Okay. So a platform I don't own. It's in a language I don't know.
But it was a little bit of an on-the-ground, wouldn't this be nice to have? I bought Final Fantasy IV on SNES for the princely sum, as our listeners love to say, of 2600 yen, which is about 13 quid. And I kind of wanted this as a sort of memento from Super Potato to take home with me.
And the TenaPenny in Japan, copies of this, because obviously the games were massive on SNES, and it was huge in Japan for it, released in North America and later in Europe, obviously. But yes, wanted just something to take home with me. I didn't think it would be appropriate to litigate all of the silly Metal Gear Solid toys I bought out there.
That seemed a little bit too out of GamesCourt's remit. But this was the pre-owned game that I did buy while I was out there, Matthew. Thoughts?
I think it's sort of a rite of passage to buy an old Famicom or Super Famicom game from Super Potato. I think everyone does this. I've done the same.
I've got an old copy of Dragon Quest V. Four or five, I can't remember which one. And so, you know, what's 13 quid for probably quite a nice...
Is it aesthetically pleasing, the box?
You know what it is? It's in a lovely bit of plastic wrap they gave it with a little Super Potato sticker. It's a nice thing to have.
Every time I look at it, it improves my day, I would say.
Yeah, I mean, the copies I had were like pre-owned, but they looked as good as new to my eye.
Yeah, yeah, really nicely maintained.
Yeah, that is the thing. I mean, is it gross to buy these shrink-wrapped things to put on our shelves rather than playing them? I mean...
Yes. Yes, okay, yes, yes. Is that what's on trial here today?
Oh, it is, right, okay. But, no, the thing is, I've done this. I see too much of my own behaviour in this to judge it.
Okay.
Partially.
Then that was the last entry. That was not guilty.
Oh, I've got another five token I didn't use.
Yeah, you should have used it on fucking PokÃ©mon Platinum. That's on you, pal. I think that means I'm not guilty overall.
Is that right?
Yeah, even if I had used it on PokÃ©mon Platinum, it would have been draw.
Oh, okay, well, there you go. So I think we've still ruled that my game tastes are, like, not unimpeachable, but, you know, sort of, like, at least, like, not impeached this time, you know? Sort of, like, have avoided impeachment, so that's good.
So it got very windy in my flat then, and my door just suddenly blew open, like, in a very dramatic moment in a movie. It's a very windy day in Bath, so that's something to look forward to. A bit of a weird summer we're having, but at least it's not fucking horribly hot, so that's good.
Okay, so I'm not guilty, Matthew. I will not be subjected to any more Dragon Age takes than the ones I'm forced to read on the internet already, so that's good. I'm happy for me there.
Anything more to add as we wrap up Gamescore here?
No, other than thank you for buying lots of games over the last few years so that we could do this episode. I enjoyed talking to you about your little secret habits. Some of these I hear about.
They bleed through in conversation. Some of them I feel like you keep to yourself for obvious reasons. You're not there at our pizza summits boasting about brute force, for example.
Yeah, I try and keep some as a surprise when we do these episodes as well. That's the thing. Who knows where we'll be three years down the line with the podcast.
What will be happening with it? Because that's such a long period of time. A couple of periods of life have passed since I've started buying these here.
So yeah, it's a bit weird to litigate some of these knowing that they were like obvious bullshit like the Pokemon one. I know that was not excusable behavior. And again, we'll emphasize that most of these I wouldn't have purchased without the Patreon.
The Patreon, very thankful for it, has unlocked this a little bit. And hey, GameScore is a way to pay it forward a little bit with content as well. I just like get some content out of these dubious purchases.
So brute force wasn't for nothing. So yes. Okay, GameScore is over, Matthew.
Next one will be a listener GameScore, probably later in the year at this point, just so we can recharge the batteries on the Matthew Castle lore. And I can come up with more great material for my opening speech, which is very important. Thank you so much for listening.
This podcast, Back PagePod on Twitter, if you want to find us on social media, also on Blue Sky at the same address. patreon.com, slash Back PagePod if you'd like two additional podcasts a month. Matthew, where can people find you?
MrBazzle, underscore pesto on Twitter, MrBazzlePesto, no underscore on Blue Sky.
And I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter and Blue Sky if you want to find me on there. In the meantime, I'm going to log off from this episode and try and do the end game in Dragon's Dogma 2.
What a fucking banger of a game that has turned out to be. Really, really good. See how that goes.
Just contend with lots of red skies and undead dragons on my Saturday. That sounds like a good use of the weekend. Matthew, let's get out of here.
