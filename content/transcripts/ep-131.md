Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how's it going? How are you feeling about the Xbox 360 draft results, which?
Oh, well, that's, I knew you'd bring that up. That's all you wanna talk about. You must be feeling pretty pleased with yourself.
Well, I don't understand how I went from having 30 odd percent of the vote to, you know, high fifties in just a few days. And I can't work out why people thought your list seemed better read out, but my list seems better written down. That's quite confusing.
Any thoughts on that?
It's because all the jokers voted for me, you know? Like all the kind of the weirdo castle stans give me those free votes without even listening to the episode. But once people actually listen to the games, they vote for you.
Your NGamer sort of cronies are all coming out of your woodwork.
Exactly.
Yeah, second cousin Thomas and all those people.
Do you know what the really annoying thing is? It's in that early stage where I do pull ahead, I sometimes, I vote for you out of like sympathy, because I think, oh, he'll probably be feeling pretty low right now. And then when you do pull ahead, every time I go on there, not only do I see that your bar's bigger, it's got my little tick in it from where I gave you that sympathy vote.
Well, I guess there's a lesson learned from this draft, not to ever do that again.
Yeah, I'm never doing that again. But I also, I don't want to retweet it out. And then people are like, oh, look at this guy, voted for himself.
Yeah, I sort of see the dilemma there. I wouldn't have minded losing this draft because the two top 10ers were very good. It wasn't like I had to watch you, you know, win the N64 draft without GoldenEye or Perfect Dark.
It wasn't that sort of thing where I was cursing your name. I thought you had a very good list and so do I. So yeah, the important thing is we all had fun and I won.
So no, I'm only joking.
Well, you're currently winning.
Yeah, that's true. It may have changed by the time. Some kind of Christmas style miracle may have occurred to turn the vote around.
Please let it be so.
Okay, looking forward to the much more cursed PS3 draft, which we decided we will do either in July or August. So we're looking forward to that. But Matthew, for now, we have another special guest.
This week's guest is Edge Deputy Editor, UK freelance veteran, Chris Schilling. How's it going, Chris?
Yeah, not bad, thank you. It's, we're fairly early in the new issue cycle. So it's kind of the calm before the storm.
Nice, nice.
Ask me in two weeks and I might have a very different answer.
Well, it's good to put together the big summer issue, but while I guess all the announcements are happening at the beginning of the issue cycle rather than the end, right, so you're not all cramming in in three days. You get a bit of time to actually figure out what matters and stack it accordingly.
Absolutely, yeah. Alex is just, I think he's flying out in the morning for us. So yeah, he's gonna be on the ground.
Oh, you've got someone going to Summer Game Fest. Exciting.
Yeah, indeed. So that's cool, Chris. So how is Edge treating you these days?
I hope well, I see some of the gifts you post and I can't help but wonder, but how is Edge going?
Yeah, outside the occasional Daniel Day Lewis moment, it's pretty full on. Making magazines in 2023 is kind of tough, but it's always great to talk to interesting people about what they're making and it's great to work with really talented writers. And it's always a great feeling to get your copy in the post and just be able to say, this is a thing that I made.
Yeah, especially because you're making it to the same standard that Edge has always been. Like, I enjoy reading the mag now as much as I ever have really. So I know how miraculous it is to pull that off in the modern age.
So I guess some kudos from me there.
Thank you.
Oh, some rare kudos.
I'm always nice to the guests. It's the listeners I'm not very nice to. So Chris, you're one of our first supporters on social media.
What are your observations on the podcast after listening for that long and finally coming on?
Oh gosh, yeah, I've been listening since, yeah, pretty much since the beginning. I think drafts are probably my favorite format. That mix of memories of great video games that you, there's always kind of stuff that, like from the 360 era, the recent one, that I was just like, oh shit, yeah, of course.
And then you have that and the mix with the sort of genuine sort of antagonism when someone picks like the other person's favorite choice.
We've got too good though at hiding that anger. I think there's a lot of kind of like, oh, good choice, good pick, where I think in our earlier, hotter headed days, we might have attempted to like pull a bit of a, well, is Fable 2 good or is GTA 4 actually good? There was a bit more of that in the earlier drafts.
Well, you say that Matthew, but when I listened back to the draft episode and when I picked Fable 2 and you went, oh, interesting, I could hear the repressed rage in, oh, interesting, kind of like underneath, like the, I was going to pick that, you motherfucker, undercurrents. I think it is still there. It's just much more under the surface.
Okay, well, it's nice to finally have you on, Chris. So thanks for taking the time. We do appreciate it.
But I guess to start with, what is your starting point with games, Chris? What got you into them?
I'm sort of very much showing my age here. Like my first, I think my first exposure to video games was certainly my first strong memory of them. It was like an arcade game on holiday.
There was a Sega racing game, top-down, vertically scrolling racing game called Monaco GP.
Right.
Not even super Monaco GP.
Just average Monaco GP.
That's how old we're talking. I think it came out in 1979. I looked it up quite recently.
So yeah, I think I was about like four or five at the time. And it's just this, yeah, like I say, vertically scrolling racing game. You're driving a straight line.
The track sort of widens and narrows, but you don't really be turning the wheel to dodge the cars. There's no like turns or anything like that. You know, not massively true to the real Monaco circuit, obviously.
And you'd have these sort of weird skiddy ice sections, which made this sort of horrible noise. And so that was sort of my first experience of video games. And then at home, it was like, we didn't actually have any consoles in the house.
It was always like, there was always this parental justification that a computer can do other things, like you can do your homework on it and stuff like that. So we had, first of all, we had a Spectrum and then we moved on to the Amiga. Like I was into magazines back then as well.
Like I read Your Sinclair and then moved on to Amiga Power when we had the Amiga. But yeah, sort of favorite games around that era. I used to love Sensible Soccer.
Cannon Fodder was another one. I remember like Monkey Island 2 as well, which came on like 11 floppy disks. It was like 11 disks, so you know it had to be good.
Like that was...
This has got the power of 11 games.
Yeah.
This one game.
Yeah. And it was like just a giant pain in the arse to play because every time you sort of went to a different location, it's like insert disk 7 or whatever. But yeah.
Did you ever work out how to form that, a save disk on the Amiga?
No, I think my dad probably did.
Did you also have to do Monkey Island in one go?
No, we did. I think there was like, I'm sure like it came with a save disk as well, like in the box.
Not my copy. Was my copy legit? I don't know.
Every time I wanted to complete Monkey Island 2, or try and complete Monkey Island 2, I was starting from the beginning of Monkey Island 2. I was one of the world's first Monkey Island 2 speed runners, just by necessity.
Amazing. That's cool, Chris. I guess from there then, what's your journey with games after that?
What are your formative games, I guess, as you are late teens, early adult kind of time?
Yeah, well, I mean, the weird thing is that at that time, obviously we didn't have consoles, but up the road, I had two friends who had a Mega Drive and a SNES. And so there was always that thing of kind of coveting this stuff that they had, like, I remember, I used to play Super Mario World around their house, and that was just kind of like, it gave it sort of a magical quality because it was sort of unattainable. So I remember, I sort of drifted away from games for a bit, and then it was around the PS2 era, and my sister got me like a, it was like a PS1 I got for my birthday, and I was like, wow, that's a generous present.
And then I didn't realize at the time it was like about, it had like gone down in price to like about 30 quid or something like that. And that's kind of how I got back into it. It was really weird because I didn't play any of the PS1 era classics.
Like my favorite game on the PS1 was Sheep, Dog and Wolf.
Is that a cartoon thing?
It was like a weird sort of sub-metal gear stealth game where you played this kind of, I can't remember what it was called. It was like the Warner Brothers Wolf character. It was a bit of a Wile E.
Coyote type, but not that one. Some kind of cursed relative of Wile E.
They couldn't even get the proper Wile E.
Yeah.
Sam, Sheep, Dog and Ralph Wolf apparently.
Oh yes, that's the one.
Iconic character.
Absolutely, yeah. And we had South Park Rally as well, which is kind of a miracle I stayed interested in the games after that really, but it was, I remember around the time like, it was around the time that the GameCube was about to come out and that was like, at the time I just like had a little bit of disposable income and it was like quite cheap. I think the GameCube was like about Â£129 or something like that.
I always remember seeing a preview of Marion Sunshine in NGC magazine, it was back when it was like really wide, it was like as wide as it was tall.
Oh yeah, that mic was huge.
Yeah, and I remember reading that and just being incredibly excited about Marion Sunshine so I thought yeah, the GameCube is the next console for me. And then I got that and it was all about Super Monkey Ball for me, like Monkey Target in particular. And Rogue Squadron as well, that was one of those real kind of graphics will never get better than this moments, you know.
And they never did.
That's interesting then. So I guess there's maybe a gap in your knowledge around the PS1 N64 era, but have you gone back and filled in those gaps or do you just accept that as an adult living an adult life, you're just going to have gaps where you've got life shit to do?
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, a little bit. I did I did go back and I played Metal Gear Solid, I played some of the I think Vagrant Story was on the PS1, wasn't it?
Yeah, yeah.
That was one I went back to. And yeah, N64 stuff like just just the kind of Nintendo classics like Ocarina of Time and Mario 64 and stuff like that. And then it was really for me, like where I really kind of got interested, like even more interested in games was with the handheld era.
We had Game Boy Advance SP and like Advance Wars in particular and WarioWare like around that sort of time was, yeah, that was sort of a really formative moment.
I have this quite distinct memory of you writing something for us about Advance Wars, about like obsessively playing it at work under your desk. Yeah. Did I imagine that?
Is that real?
No, that's entirely true. Yeah. So I was working at a firm of solicitors and I was I was sort of in the accounts department.
I had like an upstairs office. I'd just had a promotion. I had this upstairs office and I remember I was playing Advance Wars and it was about like three o'clock in the afternoon.
So there's no way I could sort of say, there's no way I could argue it was my lunch break or anything like that. And I heard my boss coming upstairs and I was like, right, I've got to put this away in my drawer and not get caught playing this game and I literally just couldn't stop playing it. I was just, he just walked in the room and just saw me playing Advance Wars and I was really, really lucky because he was just like a sound guy.
He knew I was generally sort of putting in the work and he just said, don't let anyone else catch you playing that.
This is how you repay us for your promotion, Chris.
Yeah.
It's that he pulls out his GBSP and goes, let's fight. And you're like, this is the best day of work ever.
I also love the idea of you playing Metal Gear Solid after Sheepdogger War and being like a guy who has only ever seen Boss Baby sort of vibes.
Yeah. Yeah. Very much.
This is what a real stealth game looks like.
Looking forward to the time extend on that one. Don't be there to be coming soon. That's interesting, Chris.
So I guess at what point do you know you wanted to explore games as a career? You mentioned there you had a real life civilian job and you obviously made a leap at some point into writing. So what was that journey like?
It was kind of around that time that I joined the GamesRadar forums. I don't know if either of you were ever familiar with that.
Not big forums, guys, I don't think.
No, no, no.
Just far too fancy forums I cannot talk about in this podcast.
I'd kind of graduated from Nintendo around that time. I got a PS2. I then went on and got an Xbox just purely because of Outrun 2, I think it was.
Yeah, so I was just really enjoying talking about games on forums and stuff like that. And then I started my own fan site called Press Start Online. It was just Press Start at first.
The plan was to make a magazine. That was the ultimate goal because I just love magazines so much.
That's an absolutely classic game blog name.
It is, isn't it? Press Start.
Pick some gaming terminology. Yeah.
We had this weird scoring system which was like we had two scores. We had like a head score and a heart score. The idea really I think was like the head score was like the edge score and then the heart score was kind of more like very much the reviewers' sort of personal tastes.
The idea was that you know you've got an idea. Yeah. But yeah, there was a few people that wrote for that website who've since sort of made a career from it.
I remember former Edge Editor Nathan Brown, Olivia White, who writes for Wadjet Air Games now, and John Denton, who you know, Samuel. I remember John did like one piece for the site and he sort of asked me who I wrote for. He assumed this was just a sideline and I had a regular writing gig and I said, you know, no, this is just a sort of hobbyist thing.
I don't really have any experience. And he was like really surprised. He sort of said, you should, you know, you should try and get work kind of thing.
And he just applied for a job at Games TM. I don't know if it was like staff writer or reviews editor or something like that. And he got that job.
And then sort of after a while, I think he'd been there like probably about six months, he said, would you be interested in freelancing for us? So that's, of course I said, yeah. And then so that's how I got my break.
I've got to ask, what would Metacritic make of Head or Heart Score competition?
I imagine they'd do like an in-between. Split the difference. Split the difference, yeah.
Yeah.
So that's cool. So, you know, sort of self-made to a large extent. We've got to get John on this podcast at some point, Matthew, but he reacts to albums now for a massive audience.
He's too busy just reacting.
I'm sure if I asked him, he'd be up for it. But yeah, I would imagine him reacting to this podcast. That makes such a great...
Because his thumbnails are fantastic, because you see his expressions and then you see the name of the album. I'd love to see him react to our versions of the theme tune that we did on episode 100. For example, that might be good content or very cursed, probably both at the same time.
Okay, so from there, Chris, what's your freelance career like? Because you have been doing this for a long time. And I think that Games Media is lucky to have you, frankly, because there is certainly an exodus that has occurred in the whole time that I've been there, basically, of people leaping over the fence to PR like I have or moving over to other industries, sometimes just leaving the industry entirely.
And you have kept going with it, which I, like I say, I appreciate that your steady hand is there to bring edge to life every month. So what's that journey been like for you? And I suppose like what keeps you doing it?
Yeah, I mean, that's that's kind of like quite a difficult question to answer. I mean, I sort of guess I had like quite a baptism of fire with my first review. Like the first review I did was it was like a really hardcore JRPG called Shin Megami Tensei Digital Devil Saga.
I quite liked the story of it, but it was like super hardcore. I find it a bit of a slog. I think like I played it for about 40 hours.
I think I gave it a six and when it was edited, they kind of said it reads a bit more like a five. Can we, you know, not not the score down one. And then I remember the first very first comment I got on a forum, like someone had just seen the score and said either the writer didn't play the game or hates JRPGs.
And I was like, right, okay, so that was like very much an immediate insight into the kind of feedback you could expect. It was like, like if that doesn't put you off, then it's just a case of like once I had my foot in the door, started doing stuff in more places. It was just kind of, it was really nice to have that sort of variety of stuff.
Even when I was at Imagine, like I very much still had one eye on all the stuff that Future was doing. Like I pitched to NGamer a couple of times and it was sort of turned down. I didn't quite have the tone right.
And then I did.
That wasn't to me, I should say.
No, no, no, no, no. It was, I think, I think Greener was editor back then. I think it was that sort of time.
But my in there was I wrote a feature about Chibi-Robo and then sort of started just kind of doing stuff for future from there.
I just remember you being kind of like very on the end game of wavelength in terms of like the stuff you were into, the stuff you seemed very knowledgeable about was like exactly kind of our bag. It's kind of not super obscure, but like one step beyond the mainstream kind of, you know, Chibi-Robo is a perfect kind of example. I was always sort of firm in all the years of using you as a freelancer and, you know, I think I've used you on everything I've worked on.
I was always kind of like amazed that you basically take on anything in terms of like, not like, wow, this guy will eat so much shit, it's amazing.
I remember I had, like, I reviewed, like, I think it was two real, just absolute pieces of shit for O&M. It was around the Wii U launch.
I think I gave them, like, I mean, that could have been many games.
Yeah, there was like, there was a game called, I think it was Sports Champions and I think I gave it, like, 12% or something like that, so.
Oh, I think that was, isn't that like Ubisoft's attempt at Wii Sports?
It was, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. But yeah, I think the thing I actually was going to say was more like, like, I always thought, like, you just know, you can write about anything. Like whatever game we gave you, the review would be super convincing.
And there is, that is part of being a freelancer, I think, is kind of being able to, like, be a bit of a chameleon and kind of fit into anything. But I was always kind of like, he either knows every game ever or he's just really, really good at freelancing this way.
Yeah. Or just a, just a practice bullshitter.
Well, that is, isn't that the secret source to working, you know, on Starfic and games media or enduring games media is how you bullshit your way through genres you don't know that well. That's part of the art of doing it, right?
Yeah. I think, I mean, I think as much as anything, I just like played as much as I possibly could. I didn't take it too seriously, but at the same time, I was always kind of wanting to do a good job because I was just sort of constantly aware of like, the thing about freelancing is that you can never entirely relax because you're always just sort of worried that, you know, where the next commission is coming from.
So you always just sort of want to do a good job. And I guess after a while, I sort of ended up, I got kind of a rep as a sort of safe pair of hands really. And something I think I've noticed since becoming an editor is that there is a real sort of value in someone who is just kind of really reliable.
Like you can get, there are some like really spectacular writers. There is as much value, I think, in someone who is just kind of consistently decent than someone who is kind of spectacular, but a little bit flaky and maybe doesn't hit all the deadlines.
100%.
Yeah, absolutely. So I suppose, Chris, because you were in freelance for so long, for people who don't know how that life differs from a staff position, could you give us a little bit of an outline of what the, I guess, the pros and cons are of doing it?
Weirdly, just because of the way I've kind of done things. Like a lot of people start out in a staff position then move into freelance and I've kind of done it the other way around. And probably only because of the pandemic, really, that I ended up, because the future sort of went to allow remote working.
So it's like, it's weird to think that if the pandemic hadn't happened, that I might not be Edge's deputy editor, but so yeah, from my point of view, it's not actually like I'm still just kind of sat in front of my PC most of the time. So it's not massively changed, but I think the major pro of freelance life is that you do have that freedom in determining your routine a little bit more. Like you have more of a say in when and how you work, although that is still kind of contingent on, you know, the deadlines that you've been set.
You know, in theory, you do have the freedom to choose your hours and what you do. But the reality of it is that sometimes you do need to accept reviews of Ubisoft shovelware games to pay the bills. And the other thing which doesn't really go talked about a lot when you're talking to freelancers is that when like staff changeovers and stuff like that, like you always have to kind of try and win over like new editors, like people you've not worked with before, that's like a weird, that's a really weird thing to kind of have to do, because you can be like really comfortable with an editor, just, just in general.
And then sort of someone else comes in and they don't really know you, they're not really that familiar with your work, and you've got to kind of try and convince them that you're still, you know, worthwhile kind of thing. So there's always that sort of precarity of it.
Yeah, I never really thought about it in that sense, just kind of interesting to kind of sort of how you manage your freelance, so I did a year of not very successful freelance after I was made redundant, where I just wasn't very good at it. Like I didn't really know how to kind of pursue work, and because I'm an egotistic asshole, I was just sitting there waiting for everyone to come to me, because I was like, well, of course they'll come to me. Don't they know who I am?
You know, do you aim to court a certain number of like relationships? You know, did you think of it as like, well, I've got like three bits of regular work from here or there, or were you just always hustling?
Not always. I think I was slightly fortunate in that when I was doing it, certainly around like the early days, there were a lot more places just generally, you know, particularly in print, which was just sort of became my forte. And then I'd pick up the odd online gig like Eurogamer and places like that.
But yeah, it was I think like by that point, I was established enough that enough people knew of me and knew that, you know, they could give me whatever and I just do like a reasonable job with it. You know, so it was, you know, there's always going to be a bit of hustling and, you know, particularly it's like the stuff that I pitched most was stuff that I really wanted to write. I think if you do enough of those and if you do a good enough job, then you'll sort of get asked back to do sort of other stuff like, you know, if you do like a really good job on a feature, you might start getting asked to do reviews and stuff like that.
So like I think people, you know, certainly kind of stressed out editors on deadline, like found some value in me as someone who would kind of turn around something that was sort of fairly, you know, the company would be fairly clean and what have you. I mean, not necessarily absolutely amazing, but like consistent, you know, always super strong.
Like, honestly, you were like our break glass in case of emergency. Like you can always, always run like very flexible, like, you know, it was great. I'd sometimes feel bad.
I would often think like, if we've really asked you to like eat some garbage at like a moment's notice, it's kind of like, I owe you something good down the line. And hopefully, hopefully, I think you've got to do some decent, some sort of like more prestige stuff for us along the way.
Oh, yeah, 100% Yeah, there was always Yeah, certainly, when I was doing stuff for NGamer and O&M, I might have two absolute pieces of shit. And then like, there would always be something really good around the corner.
Ah, the Wii equation.
Yeah, that was just the Wii era generally, wasn't it? It was just like, yeah.
Were you like specifically keen or interested in reviews? Because I know that's most of the work you did for us was reviews. I know some people like they have feature freelancers because they think, you know, the money per hour just doesn't make any sense.
Like, did you ever sort of think about it in those terms?
After a while, I certainly did. And I kind of, you know, certainly when I started doing stuff for Edge, you know, I got to realizing that features and interview stuff was kind of the way to go, really. I still did a lot of reviews just because I felt like that was like more of a strength, really.
I just didn't have kind of quite as much experience as feature stuff because, like, a lot of that always, well, I mean, not always, but like seemed to be done kind of in-house, like the big important features, certainly, you know, and other sort of really experienced freelancers who'd done, you know, done that stuff in the past would tend to get that sort of work. And so you just kind of like if they want you to do a review, then you just do it.
What were your highlights along the way in the freelance world, Chris? What's which features or reviews really stick with you from your time doing it?
I don't remember individual sort of features and reviews so much as like kind of like people I've interviewed and like a couple of trips that I've been on. Like I got to go to Tokyo quite early on. We were the first, we were told this anyway, that we were the first Western journalists to be allowed in Square Enix HQ.
And this was sort of around the time of Final Fantasy XII, Revenant Wings and The World Ends With You. And I remember visiting this sort of very, very, very basic kind of Japanese office. And there were all these people, kind of all these staff sort of like looking over their cubicles going, who the fuck are these guys?
We were literally just like shuttle three in like five minutes. They were like, wow, that was amazing, wasn't it? Like, you're the first Western journalist.
It was like we were literally there five minutes.
It's like technically.
Yeah. But we were there for six days. So it was like we spent like quite a lot of time, like all the work was done in a single day.
It was like a few interviews. And the rest of the time was just like, like we went into the we went to the hotel bar that they have in in Lost in Translation. That was nice.
That was really nice. We did a lot of karaoke. We on the on the final night, we recorded a CD that will hopefully never ever see the light of day.
Yeah, they had this thing where you could you could like hire a booth and they just keep bringing you like free beer, like these massive jugs of Kirin beer. And yeah, like two days later, we got an email from the PR who sent us an email saying, I've listened to the CD. It's fucking terrible.
Let us never speak of this again.
It's like the set up for like a very dark thriller. We all did something terrible together in Tokyo that must never come out.
But it was just it was just karaoke.
Oh yeah. Massively envy going on a press trip for The World Ends With You and Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings. Truly a different age, a six day press trip in Tokyo for two DS games.
I traveled to a couple of other places. I went to Singapore. I went to E3 during the year of Connect.
And literally all I had to do was file a single thousand word piece for The Observer. So that was amazing. But the really big one was getting to interview Miyamoto in Paris.
Nice. Yeah, it was for... I mean, the weird thing was it was for New Super Mario Bros.
Wii, which is like not my favorite Mario game.
It's the old Monkey Poor Sonar with Miyamoto. Everyone gets to meet him, but...
For Steel Diver or something like that, you know.
But we like we traveled down on the Eurostar and there was me and it was the first time I met Christian Donlon and we sort of really hit it off along the journey. We just got chatting. There was a guy from Wired who was clearly not a video game guy at all.
I think he called him like Miyamoto. So yeah, we got there and Miyamoto was there like absolutely full kind of PR mode, like just grinning, like thumbs up and everything like that. And we got to play New Super Mario Brothers Wii with him.
I remember like afterwards, like looking at Donlon and we both said to one another, he was really shit at that hour. Like he was really, like genuinely really terrible at his own game. And that was also the, I asked him a question about Wii music in that interview.
And he sort of held his head in his hands for about like what felt like about a minute. It was probably about 10 seconds. But I remember the PR guy at the time, who's at Apple now, is it a guy called Rob Saunders?
Bless him. He said, he said to me, oh, you ask that very sort of delicately. And he's really just jet lagged at the moment.
But yeah, I was like, I just kind of completely panicked. Yeah, I just thought, oh, God, what have I done? But yeah, you know, he kind of, it was essentially I was asking him.
Like, it seemed like a thing that he was very personally invested in. And like, how did you feel about how it hadn't done as well as the other Wii games? You know, and he gave me like a very honest answer after kind of shitting me up with his initial reaction to it.
But yeah, that was so yeah, that was fun.
Your next question was, tell me about the day you cancelled three projects at Retro Studios and gave them Retro Prime.
That's really cool, though, because you probably got more to the reality of him by asking a question like that and breaking him out of PR mode. Because it is quite hard to give a PR mode style answer to something like that when, you know, it's maybe it was, I guess, like you'd expose some kind of raw nerve or something like that. So, yeah, if anything, I'm sure it was good.
Just good color for the interview.
I love him being shit, being shit in his own game. Did you just fall down lots of holes and stuff? I'm bad at New Super Mario Brothers Wii as well.
I mean, it was the first time we'd all played it. So we were all like shit.
Oh, I didn't.
Yeah, but you all just, you know, you bump into each other the whole time. But, oh, God, yeah, I remember the other thing was that the wired guy picked up the controller, first of all, and he picked up, like, the Play One controller, and this PR guy just went, like, in a very serious tone, Mr. Miyamoto has to be Mario. Like, put the controller down.
You get, you know, he's not being blue-toed. No, he absolutely has to be Mario. So that, yeah, that's...
He picks up the Play One controller, Miyamoto puts his head in his hands and in for a minute.
And then just immediately, like, dives Mario into a hole, and then, like, you know, just on fire, and yeah.
It's like, I must be Mario. Be as fit as Mario. That's good.
Is there anything else like that on the interview front, Chris, where you were, you know, you've had someone who you've been completely blown away by or overwhelmed by the experience?
Like all of the biggest names I've spoken to have been sort of a mixture of sort of, you know, fairly kind of normal. Like, the biggest disappointment I had was I went to Nordic Game. I met the wonderful Marsh Davis there.
He was covering it for Edge, and I was doing it for Games TM at the time. And Fumito Ueda, the, you know, the eco in Shadow of the Colossus guy, was there. And I got a really short interview with him and Toyama, who was the Siren Silent Hill director.
And Ueda was really just clearly could not be asked at all. And like barely said about three words. And Toyama was just, by contrast, was an absolute delight.
Like just really friendly and happy. So it was really weird because like I went in like I'm interviewing the Colossus guy and he was really sort of like just not into it at all. Probably just going on like a bad day.
I did the BAFTA Fellowship interview with a few people like for a few years. They did like a profile thing in the brochure, which I wrote. And I got to interview like people like David Braben and Tim Schaeffer was a really good one.
He was just, yeah, he was just really, really lovely. Just really kind of naturally funny as well.
Did you watch the Psychonauts documentary?
Yeah, Jesus, yeah.
It's what you see, what you get.
Yeah, I think so, yeah, very much. Like a lot of people just kind of don't really do the press thing and they're kind of doing it under sufferance a little bit, but he was just kind of happy to talk about whatever. Sort of related to Tim Schaeffer, I am not to kind of name drop, but I remember having a lovely interview with Elijah Wood around the time of Broken Age.
It was kind of quite a short call, and the PR was kind of constantly trying to end the call, and he was just like, no, and was just happy to carry on. He was talking about how much he loved Kentucky Route Zero. He was just great, so yeah, that was it.
Yeah, he always seemed quite an authentic gamer. Didn't he end up playing Animal Crossing with a UK journo during lockdown? Did I imagine that?
I think that did happen, yeah.
There was someone like Louise Blaine or Emma Kent. They were like, hey, Elijah, do you want some turnips? And then he was in their world, just partying around going like, this is so cool.
I was so jealous.
I always remember him from the PS2 Lord of the Rings Two Towers game, Special Features, where he was the only one who played the game and was excited about the game. And then Viggo Mortensen just had that existential despair when he talked about the game. But the contrast was quite the thing.
Viggo putting his hand in his head for a one minute solid.
That's a cool line up, Chris. I mean, I wouldn't feel too bad about the Ueda thing, just because I don't think he's given that many interviews ever. Like, I don't feel like there's a whole bunch of them out there or that he's even as prolific as some of the other big Japanese creators in terms of interviews.
So you're probably not just you who had that experience.
No, I imagine not. And there have been like a party the previous night. So he probably just like had a few too many.
I know Toyama has talked. He's kind of a big drinker. So maybe he sort of took him out for a few drinks and like, Gueda is just kind of not used to having a big night out.
It's a bummer though when you meet someone who has made stuff that you really admire. I know that you're a huge fan of The Lost Guardian, right?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Was this interview before or after that?
Oh yeah, yeah, it was well before then. It was like, much closer to the release of Colossus.
It would be heartbreaking to meet someone behind something that you were like, super into, who then turned out to be like, a total bozo.
Yeah, it was, I mean, like, not so long ago. I did a very sort of short email interview with Phil Fish, who, like, I was always a big fan of Fez, and it was like, just contacting him was really weird because he's such kind of, he's so reclusive, but he was, like, I was really pleased that he agreed to sort of talk to us for that because it was like a feature on Indie Game the Movie. So, yeah, he was very kind of, like, his answers were kind of quite short, but they were really good.
Yeah, that was really nice. And just like everyone around that, actually, like, Ed McMillan was just an absolute joy, like, brought his kids on camera and everything. He was just kind of probably as you'd expect.
And then, weirdly, John Blow, who I've interviewed, like, twice now, both times I've been warned before, I know he's really prickly and difficult, and he was actually really lovely, like, both times, just, like, really happy to talk. And, yeah, so he was kind of, like, a pleasant surprise in a good way.
So, Chris, you did allude to it there, but how did you end up on Edge? You say the pandemic kind of opened this opportunity up for you, which I think for... I think this actually, the pandemic did make me realise just how limited opportunities were for people who were not willing to travel to Bath or Bournemouth before that.
And that, you know, that does sound very short-sighted, and I completely own that, but I was pleased nonetheless that people did get those opportunities when that happened and continue to get them. So how did that come about? How did you end up on Edge during the pandemic?
I'd written for Edge quite a lot before then. I'd been writing for Edge since Edge Online was a thing, so that's a long, long time ago. I used to do a few small online reviews and one or two of those ended up in the magazine and then just gradually worked my way up to becoming a regular freelancer.
And then it was just before the pandemic, actually. It was when Nathan was just about to leave and he was talking about bringing me on board.
They said, well, we'll put you down as a contributing editor. And so I was paid X amount of money to write a certain number of pages each issue. And then when Jen took over, it felt a little bit more collaborative then.
I was more heavily involved. I did a cover on my first cover project was Spelunky 2. Yeah, that was unbelievable that issue because that was kind of like a real sort of Hail Mary.
I was really lucky in the sense that I'd spoken to Derek Yu for a feature about a game he was making called UFO 50, which still hasn't come out. So I had his email and just sort of said, I knew Spelunky 2 was coming out. And so I just said, would we be able to do like an exclusive review and a review cover for that?
So we ended up doing that. So I think that sort of stood me in good stead when towards the end of the year, Gen left to go to Media Molecule. So at that point, they obviously needed someone to take over.
I think Tony had interviewed like a couple of potential editors and that hadn't quite worked out. So he sort of said, do you want to come aboard as deputy? So I said, yeah.
That's awesome. I'm pleased you got the opportunity. So I suppose, Chris, what is it about Games Media that still appeals to you?
Because I guess you're approaching two decades doing it, right? So what is it about it that I guess I don't say keeps you coming back because it is a job. But I suppose what is appealing about it for you at this point?
Lack of alternatives. No, but the money, obviously.
Daniel Day-Lewis gif.
I still feel like there is a huge amount of value in what we do, in what Edge does, certainly. You know, despite all the money in games, I think it's really hard for high quality games coverage to get real traction online. And it feels like it's harder for publications to justify the investment in that, which isn't to denigrate the work that a lot of people do and chat out to guide writers, because that is a really sort of thankless task.
It feels important that there is someone documenting what is happening in the medium at this time, and in print you get the sort of benefit of, like you don't have the fear that it's going to be suddenly wiped from existence when someone in a suit looks at a spreadsheet and sort of says, no, and it's closed down. You know, like Edge, you know, we do have our own blind spots. You know, there are certain elements of the industry that we don't have the time or the resources to properly capture.
But like just to try to curate a magazine every month that captures like a reasonable cross section of the games industry, you know, at a particular moment in time, that still feels like an interesting and a worthwhile and a rewarding thing to do. And, you know, like every month you get to talk to people like here, much smarter than you and work with really talented writers and, you know, just get to discuss and talk about and disseminate a subject that you all have this shared interest in. And as absolutely exhausting as that can be at times, that sort of feels like a worthwhile thing to at least attempt to do.
Very well said.
I think as well the thing about print that you maybe forget if you haven't read something, read a magazine for a while, is that it lives outside of the Twitter sphere and the overall, like how the relationship with games has become very linear over the past few years in terms of like it's a, you know, it's a tunnel of live streams basically is what's kind of replaced what was there before. And I think that something that feels like it lives outside of that, but is authoritative and is covering other areas of games that you are maybe not talking about or thinking about on a daily basis is refreshing. And I feel like that's what I kind of get from Edge in its current form, Chris.
I think it's just that detachment from the thing I look at every day and a more level-headed, lateral look at what is going on in games. I don't know if that's the intention, but that's how modern Edge feels to me.
Yeah, I mean, that's very gratifying to hear that, because that's sort of what we're going for. I think as much as anything, Mags can be a useful bullshit filter. There's just so much out there right now.
And like I said, there's going to be stuff that we miss, because there's only so many of us and there's only so many pages we have. But just trying to get as broad a cross-section of the industry and kind of like really cut to the heart of what, you know, stuff that we find interesting, stuff that we think is interesting and that people want to read about. And I do think that people who read Edge kind of just, yeah, just appreciate that we sort of kind of try and tune out some of the bullshit a little bit and kind of really, yeah, cut to the heart of what's good in games at the present time.
If Edge is the bullshit filter, NGamer is the used filter, which has only collected all the bullshit in it. That's just all it is, is that.
And that's kind of what this podcast is.
Yes. It's OK, great. I've got to touch that filter, gross.
All right, then let's take a break then, Chris, and we'll come back and pelt you with some more questions about Edge. That feels like it's going to be good. So yeah, let's take a quick break and come back.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, time to bother Chris with lots of questions about Edge Magazine, which should be good fun. So, Chris, do you remember what it was like when you were first commissioned by Edge, and did you approach it differently to any other freelance work that you'd done at that time?
Yeah, I actually don't remember what my very first commission was, because it would have been for Edge Online. So, I think of the first MAG commission as my first proper Edge commission. The first commission I had was not the most glamorous one.
It was an interview... I should say it was an interview. No shade on the interviewees.
It was two of the founding members of the Yogscast. Oh, yeah?
My old bosses.
So, not the most exciting gig on paper, but it was exciting in the sense of, I'm going to have a piece published in Edge. And, you know, they were decent guys. It was a nice interview.
I would say it wasn't hugely different to how I would have approached another commission for any... like for any new publication, because as a freelancer, you're constantly aware of the need to make a good first impression, partly just as a sort of pragmatic thing, because you're like, I want more work from this person or this magazine or this website or whatever. But this being Edge, I probably sort of overthought it even more than I ordinarily would have done.
I've not sort of gone back and read it recently, but I think it was fairly sort of meat and potato stuff, but nothing like really spectacular, but like crucially good enough to fit in Edge without anyone sort of immediately noticing, like, who wrote this bullshit, you know?
When I first wrote for Edge, which may actually have been my first little bit of freelance, unless I did something for Games Monster first, I did a review of Spectrobes, the quite bad Disney Pokemon ripoff where you excavate fossils and then bring them back to life and then make them fight, which on paper is actually a very traumatic journey for that creature. I've been asleep for millions of years and I'm, oh no, blood sports, is it? Good.
And not only was the review quite average, because I didn't really know how to write for Edge, but I think it caused a huge stink with Disney because it was like an early review of it. So like my first experience of Edge was like, you've caused us all this hassle. Margaret and Tony giving me quite stony looks across the office.
You being a big Pokemon fan, of course, Matthew. Yeah.
I was gonna say the same thing. Yeah, that's like, they found the right guy for the gig there.
Big mistake.
That's good. So it always felt to me that Edge, with Edge you had to earn your reputation as a freelancer in a way that maybe wasn't comparable to working for other outlets. Do you think that's true, Chris?
Or do you feel like you earned trust over time?
Yeah, I mean, I think having done stuff for Edge Online, like on a weekly basis, like there was a group of us and Donlon was one of them. There was like three or four of us would do like tiny reviews for the website every week. And so they'd sort of got used to me that way.
And then once I had my foot in the door a little bit more with this Yogscast piece, it was just kind of, I don't think I did any reviews for a little while. It felt like they had to get a sense of your critical radar a little bit. I mean, that's kind of still the case now a little bit.
Like we rarely start any new freelancers on reviews. It's kind of like gauging like their tastes in general and just kind of obviously their writing quality as well. But I remember like I didn't really get that many pointers.
There was a sort of like almost an understanding or certainly like from my perspective that you would read the mag. You get like the odd sort of stylistic thing here and there where they take like, don't use this word or don't put this that way. But I would always sort of like compare the finished piece with like the draft that I'd submitted and just to sort of try and figure out what worked and what didn't and, you know, figure out what had been changed.
Although like, as I would later learn, like in some cases that's just cutting stuff down to fit the page rather than the writer having necessarily done anything wrong. Right.
I suppose like a good question, I suppose to ask here, sort of on top of that is, what was your relationship with Edge as a reader? Because when I first started reading Edge, it was the early noughties and it was quite a, I felt like quite a distinctive phase of the mag's life in terms of these very conceptual covers they were doing. But I remember even as somebody who was primarily reading PC Gamer and official PS2 mag around the time that I was grateful that something like Edge existed, that treated games in this very elevated way.
So I suppose curious to know for you coming into it as a freelance and then eventual staffer, what was your relationship with the magazine?
I mean, weirdly, I was listening to the episode with Nathan not so long ago and we have sort of weirdly similar relationships with Edge in that we weren't really like massively into it to start with. Like I definitely have issue one somewhere in the house, but after that it was, and that was just kind of like, wow. I remember at the time thinking this is far too cool.
I'm not cool enough or smart enough to read this magazine, but this is kind of cool thing to have kind of thing. And then sort of over time, like the first time I really remember getting heavily into Edge was one of the early-ish 10 out of 10s, which was Half-Life 2. And that issue I remember had the DS on the front.
It was like a silver cover and it had the DS on the front and you could like flip it up. Like the flap opened up and you got like the top screen of the DS. And I just remember, I remember getting that.
And that was like at the time I'd, I'd got a PS2 and I got an Xbox. And I remember reading the Half Life 2 review and thinking, wow, that sounds amazing. I really need, like the next thing I need is like a gaming PC.
And I didn't get one of those for like a long time after that. But that was like a really sort of formative moment in terms of my relationship with Edge. I just kind of, I remember that review being really memorable.
And after that, like I think I've got like every copy of the mag since then.
What was the significance of how Edge reviewed games to you as a reader versus other outlets? Edge scores are always discussed differently to those of any other outlets and seem to get more scrutiny in some circles. In fact, they definitely do.
But why do you think that is?
I mean, I think partly it's a history thing. There's always been this sense of like authority to Edge reviews. And I think some of that was like the absence of bylines, but also the tone of the mag.
You got a sense of like, here's a magazine that takes games seriously, which isn't to say that other mags didn't. But I always had the sense of Edge being a little bit more unforgiving. Like going back to the press start thing, like with Edge, it was always the sense of this is very much the head score, not the heart score.
And I think they're still discussed differently to other outlets just because of the mags own standing in the industry. Like it's been running for a long time. I'd be the first to say it's not as big a deal as it once was, but it still feels like there's enough people out there who think the word of Edge has a certain weight to it.
And I think as someone who was aware of Edge from the beginning, as you know, I've read it, like I said, pretty religiously for the past 20 years, you do feel a bit that weight yourself when you write a review, like kind of bearing down you all that history and the need to get it right adds a certain pressure, I think, like probably more for certain games than others.
How do you think Edge's editorial style has evolved over the years? And how do you define it now as the deputy editor?
It's a hard question to answer for someone who's been close to Edge for so long now. Like I think it's probably one of those things that's easy to see from the outside, because a lot of what defines Edge is stuff you, I think when you've been writing for Edge for a while, you sort of absorb and intuit like the style over time. It's weird, it's like you have a very kind of, there's a very basic style guide that's sort of barely evolved.
It's just kind of something that sort of happens almost by osmosis, like that you understand what feels like the Edge way of doing things and what doesn't. Like I remember always when I started out, I always found it quite daunting to begin with, not as approachable or as welcoming, I think, as the kind of, you know, particularly the Nintendo Max that I used to buy. I sort of like to think, like over time, I think particularly since Nathan took charge, it felt a little bit more accessible.
Like you still see people saying Edge is kind of aloof and humorless and we don't love games. And I think that's largely from people who haven't read it in like probably 10, 15 years or whatever. And like obviously we're not trying to make like jokes and puns on every line or anything, but I think anyone who reads Edge on a regular basis knows, you know, there are gags and puns and, you know, weird references and moments of sarcasm, ryo-sides and stuff like that.
It's kind of a subtle thing.
Ryo-sides.
Ryo-sides is very much...
That's what you call box-outs.
Yeah. You know, it's like kind of a subtle thing. It's not real sort of in-your-face humor, but it's definitely there.
Yeah.
I think, you know, up to a point in terms of editorial approach, I think it's always going to reflect the taste of the people who make it. But at the same time, like some of that's about reflecting how the industry itself has changed. Like the rise of indie games, for example.
I think during Nathan's Reign, and particularly when Jen came aboard, there was a really kind of distinct shift in that direction that I noticed as someone who reads Edges and writes for it. And I mean, up to a point, that was in line, you know, like I say, that was in line with the way the winds were blowing with the industry, though, like Jen was particularly brilliant at keeping up with that side of things. Like the editorial style, like I think it's always going to feel like a collaborative thing.
Like there aren't many examples I can think of where Edge feels like, you know, a particular kind of single person's personality comes through. It's like the product of everyone who makes it, including the freelancers.
I think there is some truth in the idea that a style guide is as much about a set of people sharing a set of values as it is about a document that's written down somewhere that says, this is what it is. I think that, and I felt that on PC Gamer as well, when I remember a colleague left and a really pivotal sort of member of the team, really important member of the team left, and said to me that, well, you know, you and Phil Savage are still here, so you have what we consider the PC Gamer UK, mag values are still here, and then you kind of pass those along to the new staff and that sort of thing. So yeah, I think there's a lot of truth in that.
And I do think that as well, if I was to have, I guess an attempt to what I think an edge piece would look like 15 years ago versus one now, I think there would be, the approach I would take would be a gradual opening up to, you know, a slightly lighter on its feet way of writing sometimes. Is that fair, Chris?
Yeah, I think that's absolutely fair. I think Nathan was a big part of that. I think, yeah, like I mentioned the humor a little bit, like certainly Nathan punched that up a little bit.
I think you can see if you read like his Hit Points newsletter, like that feels like a distillation of everything that he did so well during his time in charge. And like some of that was kind of making it a little bit more approachable. I'm interested actually, like for PC Gamer, were those values ever kind of really, sort of clearly articulated or was it something that you just sort of ended up intuiting like over time?
Because that sort of feels like how it's been with Edge. It's kind of something that comes about like almost organically, like through discussions that you have with the other staff.
Gosh, it's, we definitely had a style guide of sorts, but it was, I think it had a little bit on tone, but it was more about just, you know, how we format things, how Tony Ellis hated using smorgasbord in reviews. He fucking despised that. But it was something you wouldn't chew it, I think.
You would see that some newer writers who maybe hadn't read the mags since 1998, like I had, didn't necessarily have that grounding with it, and so made me thought, well, I guess PC game is like writing for X website except it's more about PC games. Whereas I think that there is like a funny but smart tone, and PC gaming to its core, just very deep seeded knowledge and history and legacy you carry around with you. I think it, yeah, weirdly though, I don't know if that was written down as such, but it was just something when you picked up the magazine, you knew it when you saw it.
Yeah, I mean, you do get that with like freelancers. Like when you get a pitch through, you can always tell which ones like read edge on a regular basis and which ones don't. Like there's just something there like you can tell.
And you can, you know, you can work with new talent and kind of nurture that and sort of get them into sort of understanding how how edge does things. But you're not going to get that through the style guide. Like, you know, it's just stuff like one of the one of the things that kind of sticks out to me in the style guide is like under franchise, it just says, do not use this word in all caps.
But yeah, there's it is like you say, Samuel, with the PC game one, it's it's kind of a lot of that isn't sort of elaborated. It's just kind of it's just, yeah, use this word, don't use this word.
But yeah, obviously, I think we had like a review specific one that was a bit more precise about what we wanted. But there's also an element of it where you think, you know, how fair is it to ask a younger generation of writers to have read a magazine for, you know, the last 15 years in the way that I had before it started working in games media? And the answer is, it's not really you have to make allowances for people, right?
You have to they have their own way into into things. It doesn't mean that they don't understand or respect what you do. But they just they inevitably grow up in a different world.
You make different allowances.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And that that usually like when we work with a New York writer, we usually sort of we don't ask them to submit stuff through the content management system.
Like first thing, it's usually like send us a Google doc. We'll kind of go through it in a little bit more detail and just kind of try and outline stuff, you know, stuff to do, stuff to avoid a little bit more. But yeah, I mean, I think I like to think like the really the really diligent freelancers, at least kind of try and like pick up a copy or, you know, get a digital copy of the mag and kind of look through it and like realize, you know, where they should be pitching and, you know, the sort of thing that we're into.
And yeah, the you know, the best ones, the ones that kind of tend to stick around longest do that.
So I suppose to to dig a bit deeper into the review stuff, Chris, and I guess the name of this episode, do you remember the first time, well, she's mentioned the Half-Life 2 10 was the first Edge 10 you remember as a regular reader. Was that your first encounter with the idea of an Edge 10 being a big deal? Or were you kind of aware of its history before that in the the 90s with the likes of Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time, those kind of earlier 10s?
Yeah, I remember that. I feel like the first time I was really kind of acutely aware of the Edge 10 being a massive deal was Halo. And I remember that being a massive deal because that was like the first one in like three years or something like that.
I think that was the first one since Ocarina. And so that was, I can't remember whether I bought that edition of the magazine, but I definitely was aware of it at that stage and I was aware of like the weight that it had. I vividly remember being really excited when there was like three Edge 10s in three successive issues, which was there was Halo 3 and then The Orange Box and then Mario Galaxy, which was just that was kind of like, wow, three like three 10s in a row.
This is like we're, you know, we're feasting really here. This is a golden age of games kind of thing. Those were the sort of times that I became really sort of vividly aware of like the importance of an Edge 10 and that was like a massive deal.
It ages really well giving Halo a 10, I think it really, I think it does indicate a shifting of time and taste a little bit and the console front. And so it's, yeah, I think it's, you know, while I don't necessarily think that, you know, you shouldn't use the full range of score if you feel it's right, there is, like you say, huge significance to three years between Ocarina of Time and Halo. So yeah, super interesting.
And then, like, even like even when I was a freelancer, like each one after that was a surprise because a 10 was always a closely guarded secret. It was always like you don't tell anyone outside the inner circle what is getting a 10. Like I remember, funnily enough, the Skyward Sword 10 was the issue that the Oggscast piece that I mentioned was published.
So that was kind of like a nice sort of double whammy for me. Like my first Edge piece has been published alongside an Edge 10. That was really exciting.
I suppose that's a good segue, Matthew. So people still bring up your Skyward Sword 10 a lot of the time when discussing Edge and the idea of an Edge 10. And usually in an unhelpful way, I would say, and not a particularly constructive way, a dismissive way.
When you see that now, how do you feel about it as the person who thought long and hard about giving it that score?
It's always annoying when anything becomes a bit of a clumsy shorthand for anything, especially if it becomes a kind of shorthand for a bad call. Which it arguably is. I think there's a couple of Edge 10s which people find very questionable, and this is often one of them that's brought up.
I find it a little hard to untangle for the fact that I'm fundamentally very proud of that review, and I stand by its thinking. I think what it says is right. Actually it's funny this week I've been reading as many Edge 10 reviews as I can get my hands on for this episode, because I was thinking about how many of these reviews did I actually know why these games got a 10, and going back and reading some of the earlier ones and seeing the kind of justification there.
Actually, this is a bit of a broad answer to this question, but I think it's worth saying. What is interesting about Edge is there are lots of games you would probably consider like masterpieces or seminal titles or shifts in genres that got 9s and could have very easily been 10s. Often I thought the thread in the 10 reviews was you could sense something just really clicking with someone, like it had the edgier values of this is important for some reason or this is groundbreaking for some reason, which I think is a bit of a common thread across the 10s.
But then those reviews could have existed as 9s and just what pushed it over was, and this really clicked. The Gran Turismo review, and I don't know if either of you have read this recently, is a really interesting one because it is just someone who clearly fucking loves driving and this game happens to tap into and capture the driving experience better than any driving game had up until then. But in the hands of someone who doesn't care about driving, that game ain't getting a 10 in that same review process.
I actually felt a bit of a kindred spirit to that with Skyward Sword. I was into motion gaming. I had spent the last five, six years of my career just reviewing Wii motion games basically and Wii remote games and motion control games.
I thought I was, I know what a bad motion game is and I know what the best one's kind of awakened in you. And this one I thought was, I still think it is the best motion control game that I've played. And that's kind of where it was coming from.
But obviously you don't get that context in the same way that like you only have to infer that the Gran Turismo reviewer is a big motorhead. I think there's an interesting space where a nine becomes a ten basically is my short answer.
I'm going to back you up on this, Matthew, because I gave Skyward Sword a ten as well. Admittedly not.
Lots of people did.
Yeah.
Like, it's a really well reviewed game. I mean, that's one defense of it. It wasn't just Edge 10.
I mean, that is a high scoring game on Metacritic. I think IGN gave it a ten, Eurogamer gave it a ten.
Yeah, I'm totally with you on the idea, and I think probably because I'd also played a lot of motion games and there was always this... I mean, from a lot of the American websites in particular, there was always this dismissal of motion controls as waggle, like regardless of whether it was actually waggle or not. As you say, Skyward Sword actually felt like they'd really kind of tried to...
It felt like Nintendo had tried to sort of make a game that was a total counter to those accusations that motion controls were bullshit. And it has that weird thing where you look back on it now and you kind of think it doesn't have like the space that Breath of the Wild gives the player. It's very, very dense.
It's very kind of packed with puzzles. So you don't get that sort of sense of freedom in terms of the exploration or anything like that. But I remember at the time and I wondered after I reviewed it that you do get a certain like when you spend a lot like a really kind of concentrated period of time with a game, you get a sort of kind of Stockholm syndrome with it where you're just so attached to it.
It's difficult to like you're almost too close to it after after that amount of time in like a short space of time.
I think that happens with like loads of big games. I think, you know, the review, the review period just does does that. There's there's so many things which I like cool on a bit later or I'm a little bit like, oh, yikes.
Yeah, I know. I won't take any responsibility for any more of like dodgy edge scores that I may have given in recent years. But like, you know, I've given some things where I'm like, oh, man, that game like really did a number on me.
And maybe with a bit of distance, I might score it differently. Just to bring it around to the 10 thing, I just think there is a vein of Edge 10 reviews, which are maybe more more heart picks than head picks that occasionally get through. And they seem to be the ones which people are maybe more critical of or less into.
But at the same time, all of those reviews come from a place of pure love. And I don't want to like, you know, the one thing I definitely don't want to do this episode is like, challenge any of Edge 10, you know, every reviewer who gave one of those 10s really believed in it. And that's super important.
But like, you know, I'm maybe thinking more things like the Bayonetta review, for example, which is like such a heart pick, and a game which clearly resonates with a huge genre head. And that just comes through. And like, if you're on that same wavelength, you'd be like 100%.
This makes perfect sense. But if you're outside of it, and maybe that does suggest the existence of a more objective Edge 10, which is kind of a bit colder, harder and harder to argue with. But that's my theory anyway.
I do think you always like when you're writing an Edge 10, you are always kind of aware of that. Like I was saying, there is the kind of weight of history bearing down on you. But I mean, that's why it always sort of slightly rankles with me when people say that Edge doesn't love games, because we sometimes award something like we give Horizon a 7 or something like that.
Like you read an Edge 10 review and that's palpably not true. Because you can really feel the love, I think, in an Edge 10, even if it feels a little bit more like a head pick. There's always that love in there.
Maybe that is more of an earlier Edge 10, because the reviews I've been reading, like the Mario 64 review, which is that the first Edge 10? It's quite a technical appraisal of the game. Maybe that is what impressed at the time, but it talks more about the breakthroughs in terms of like, wow, there's texture work, or that this world exists, or this kind of movement.
It's not like a gut feeling, it's not like this awoke something in me. It's, you know, it's quite a dry review, like, I would say it doesn't really read like a 10 hilariously, from the experience of having written one, is that I don't think you set out to write a 10 review. You maybe write the review, and then you get to the end and you're like, I've kind of made this argument, and this is where it's come to, like, the 10 should be like natural conclusion at the end, rather than just like, oh, that doesn't really gel.
But that Mario one is almost, it's almost a little too, like, logical, you know, it's a little bit too kind of like, yes, well done. But maybe that is just like edge of the time as well.
Yeah, I think I think that actually speaks to what Samuel was saying that, like, maybe the editorial style has changed a little bit. And but yeah, I, from my point of view, I sort of slightly disagree with the and perhaps it's because I've been sort of really close to edge for a long time. Like, I think sometimes when you're reviewing a game, like you do get a sense of not when you're writing the review, but when you're playing it, you sometimes think, oh, actually, I think this might be a 10.
And I probably thought about that far more writing for edge, like even as a freelancer than than I did like writing for other other magazines.
But then if you have that sense, this is such a funny topic as we're like talking around, you know, don't want to just be like, I gave this 10, this 10, this 10, this, you know, like, there's like, there's still a semblance of mystery with this. But if you have that feeling when you're actually writing the review, do you find yourself kind of interrogating that sense? Is that what the review is?
Is it kind of like, I'm thinking 10 and then I'll see if it still has that at the end or what's I know, kind of what I'm interested in what's going through your head.
Yeah. I mean, I've, I've given out like three edge 10s now and it's been slightly different each time. I think, you know, I think it's probably the most important edge score to get right.
And so I think over the max history, there'd probably been a few times where games have got nine and then later, I mean, I said, I said, I think that might have happened. I know it has like the writer will have admitted that it should have been a 10. You do sometimes find yourself second guessing these, these things because you're just kind of like, Oh, is it really a 10?
And I think the reaction to it does kind of play into that a little bit, but it's mostly just kind of thinking about like, what is the legacy of this game? Like, does this do anything that is, that feels kind of different, that feels particularly remarkable? And I think it's, it's changed slightly in the sense that like an Edge 10 used to mean revolutionary.
Right.
And now it doesn't necessarily have to be that. It can just be something that is a real, that is a game that should make you sit up and take notes. It's a score that says, here is a game that has some kind of real significance.
And if you're interested in video games, you should strongly, you know, consider making time to play it. It's interesting because I can't imagine there are many other game publications that have part of their Wikipedia entry, like dedicated to the 10 out 10s or where it's big enough to like warrant review scores, news stories on websites. Like I remember when the Immortality Review came out and like people were writing news stories about that.
It's like it's a big deal. Like I think probably only like a Famitsu 40 out of 40 is the only other one that really sort of comes close to that.
Yeah, it's interesting. On PC Gamer, we did have a sense of how high can the percentage go because we know we gave Deus Ex this or Half Life that and there was a bit of that to it, but Edge is quite specific in the sense that the 10s feel in conversation with each other somewhat instead of a short enough list that it feels like there is some kind of weird continuity that unites these games that otherwise might not have anything in common, which is quite unusual, right?
Yeah, just to touch upon something else that I've always kind of wondered is like particularly for an early Edge 10, I've sometimes wondered and the Immortality one was a kind of real case in point. Like I wondered if it had a slight influence on the reviews that followed, like just in terms of perhaps emboldening people slightly to give it full marks if they were like, like I really think this is brilliant, but is it like a nine or is it a 10? And then the fact that, you know, it gets an Edge 10 and the Edge 10 still kind of has that weight, like in the parallel universe where I wuss out and give immortality a nine, like what sort of effect does that have on its Metacritic or whatever?
Right, right.
I don't know.
Yeah, I can see that. I can, you know, I definitely know some people who are a little more nervous around scoring, well not nervous, but don't mind being in conversation with what other people are writing and saying. And personally, I've always liked to review in isolation a bit and not really worry about it.
But I can see that happening. So, it definitely helps, like, lead the charge a bit, you know, I can't think of there being many Edge 10s where Edge is the only people who liked it. I don't think that's ever happened.
Maybe. I'm not sure anyone likes Bayonetta quite as much as Edge.
Well, weirdly, I think it's probably Bayonetta 2 is the one that kind of stands out as being...
Edge 10s and sequels is an interesting one. Because if you do have this sense of maybe the old sense of like groundbreaking and maybe like you say, the kind of the idea of it has changed enough that it's like just set up and pay attention. Almost by default it feels weird talking about sequels and trying to put a score on sequels.
Even if we're not talking about 10s, you know, I've reviewed sequels for Edge and I'm like, oh man, like, should this just be what I think? Is this review in any kind of dialogue with what was said before? That feels like weirdly more of a more of a minefield in Edge than anywhere else.
I don't know why that is. That might just be my own brain being dumb.
No, I think that's absolutely true. Yeah, it's happened before. Like it's happened before to me.
Like you you review a game and then you review a sequel and it's kind of like, well, this is probably slightly better, but it's like it doesn't kind of quite give me the same feeling of like freshness that I had with the original. One sort of interesting case in point, although it's not it's not a 10 was Splatoon. Like the first Splatoon got a 9.
Right.
And then second got an 8 and then like the third one got a 7. And there's a case to be made for like Splatoon 3 being objectively the best Splatoon game. But it's just it's essentially the same as the first.
And it's like almost like the curse of Nintendo is that if they get so much right the first time, like how do you improve upon that?
The impressive work continues.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there are exceptions to like looking at the edge list. Like you've got Super Mario Galaxy 2, which is just I mean, that is a better game than Galaxy.
It just it just is. And it probably has enough new stuff in that to kind of justify full marks again, I think. But yeah, at the same time, it's not it doesn't fulfill that original sort of remit of The Edge 10, which is revolutionary, because it's it's not but but yeah, it is yeah, like you say, it's a it's a real minefield and you kind of you find yourself sort of, yeah, really second guessing yourself when you're writing this stuff.
Yeah, it's interesting as well, Matthew, you mentioned the Mario 64 review being quite technical. I suppose if you've never seen anything like that before, how do you explain it? You know, there isn't a predecessor as such you can point out and go to comparing it to a 2D game, which is what they do in the Ocarina of Time review as well.
They talk about a link to the past. It's like you're just you're you're looking at a new frontier. It's really hard to get your head around it so I can sort of see why in that specific instance they were, you know, wrestling with that a little bit.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, there's like no cliches to rely on. No easy crutches in that sense. We have it easy now, like you've seen everything there can possibly be and it's all just variations or cocktails of what came before.
So yeah, yeah, maybe. I still think it's quite a hard, quite a hard edged review. And it's just sort of funny.
There's a, oh, there was, what was it in there? There was a, like one of its, one of its criticisms was really odd.
I remember you mentioned that the story criticism in Ocarina of Time review was a bit odd in retrospect because it's something about, I think, like Americanisms in the, in the text and it's a bit of a strange thing to pull out.
It was a real, but yeah, that was it, it was just a real, that, yeah, that was definitely in the Ocarina review. It just, it just read like a real, like minor bug bear in something which you're giving, like your third ever 10 and you're saying is this like huge generational leap from what came before and yet you're like, but while I'm here, you know, I just have to get this off my chest.
I think that reviews as well, there was maybe a time where they were slightly more laundry listy than a kind of like a constructed bit of prose, I guess it was, there was a little bit of, you know, like you, you do get to the point of the review where you kind of like list the stuff that doesn't work for you. And maybe that was slightly more of a, like a 90s and noughties phenomenon. And maybe now reviews are a bit more, the writing styles has changed.
I don't know. Maybe there was just a sense of we've got to take off something. I'm not sure.
It's still a good review.
So what you're saying is like Edge is much better now than it used to be?
No, it's just, it's just funny that people's memory of Edge is that it's, it writes these games like incredibly hard and it's very sophisticated and it's very, you know, high for looting in its takes. So I was reading, it's not a 10 review, but I was reading the review of Metal Gear Solid 1 this week. I shared this with Sam actually, you know, it's talking about how this is like quite revolutionary in terms of its storytelling and the kind of like depth of its systems and how playful it is.
And then there's a quote where it says, it's odd then that Konami should choose to erode some of the realism it's worked so hard to create by representing weapons and ammo as floating rotating boxes. And you're just like, what? Like that feels like, well, I got to say something bad here or I've got to give it a 10.
I suppose it is true that if you think about the amount of realism in Metal Gear Solid in terms of like snow tracks and snake breathing, then there is, you know, maybe that contrast does seem surprising in that. I can sort of see that.
But now I see it's just the visual language of those games because they so religiously stuck to that quite abstracted style that you were like, oh, this is this is intentional. Now I think you'd be like, wow, what a bold kind of authorial vision to stick with these kind of deliberately strange icons.
But it's funny that you jump forward nine years from there and Matthew, you compiled in your reviews the Grand Theft Auto 4 review. And I found the writing style in that one so much warmer than the 90s ones. And it was such like a rich appreciation for what GTA 4 was trying to achieve in that text.
And it really did feel like the midpoint between what I consider 90s edge and what I consider edge now. The text that supports these 10s for sure. Chris, I had like one more question on this.
And obviously you'll come back one day and we'll do the Edge 6 episode where we talk about that whole process. That'd be fun. But what is the process like when giving out an Edge 10?
You kind of alluded to it there. You sort of know what it is. But how safeguarded is the 10 for the right moment, essentially?
For two of the ones that I've done, like the reviews come in so late in the issue that it's just kind of been on trust kind of thing. You have to be absolutely certain. There have been some cases where I've nearly given a 10 and it's just kind of like, if there is even the slightest hint of doubt, then you should not do it.
Then you should hold it back.
Have you dodged any real bullets? Were there any nearly 10s where now you're like, yeah, absolutely not?
No, I don't think so. It was interesting though. There was this Belonka 2 issue and at the time we hadn't given out any 10s to any indie games and that was the issue that we reviewed that and we reviewed Hades and the same issue.
And there was a big long debate about whether we should give one of them a 10 because they were both really close and I wasn't quite feeling it with Spelunky 2 and with Hades it was closer but at the same time just the way the mag was allocated. Spelunky 2 is the lead review because it was an exclusive and it was on the cover and as much as anything it just felt weird that we were putting this game on the cover and giving it a 9 and then here's another game in the same genre and we're giving it a 10. It was like why wouldn't you put that on the cover instead?
But yeah, it was...
What a fuck you.
Yeah, so I do, part of me does wonder if we'd reviewed Hades an issue later, whether that might have been the first. But at the same time it was just a really nice moment when we gave it to Immortality because that ended up being quite a big deal.
Yeah, absolutely. I think, like you say, it sort of creates some momentum and expectation and, you know, it's a, you know, as we say, the Edge 10 is still a real event. So yeah, that's cool.
It's exciting. Once you know there's one out there, there's one in the mix or there's one in the wild, you know, there's like, what's it going to be?
I'm really excited to see what the, like, you do, I do find myself sometimes like going through the release schedules and thinking, could that be the next Edge 10? That's always quite an exciting thing to do. Yeah, I've looked through, I don't think there's going to be another one for the rest of this year, but you know, you never know.
Something might come along and sort of shock us.
I suppose like, is it worth us asking you about Tears of the Kingdom, Chris?
You can do, yeah.
It's something we talk about every week on this podcast now. So, yeah, I suppose like, what was your journey with that game like? Because it did seem, like you say, maybe the only natural 10 candidate on the calendar.
So yeah, like I suppose in relation to The Edge 10, what was your journey with that game like?
Yeah, that was interesting because, yeah, there were times during Tears of the Kingdom, certainly kind of earlier on, where I was like, I'm not sure this is a 10. And then kind of gradually it sort of crept up and then I was like, yeah, this is, and I was more and more confident about it. The interesting thing was that I don't do this often because I like to, like Matthew, you were saying you like to kind of review stuff in isolation.
But I remember I was discussing it with Kesa and with Kesa MacDonald, Guardian Games Editor and with Edwin Evans Thirlwell, who sometimes writes for Edge, but was reviewing it for Eurogamer.
Kicked its face off on Eurogamer.
Yeah, I mean, they were both slightly cooler on it than me. And so that was kind of like a point at which I thought, am I going to be sort of hauled over the coals for giving this a 10? Kind of thing.
But I think like I think Kesa was sort of like saying it was the controls of it. I think it was like we were discussing that and how it's kind of perhaps not immediately accessible. Like there's a lot of kind of fiddling around with Ultra Hand and how that works.
Like once I got to grips with that and some of it is like the pressure of like just the review situation. I mean, it's it was really weird that compared to say something like the the Bayonetta spin-off thing, like we got like far less time with Nintendo's biggest game in years than we did with this Bayonetta spin-off. Right, yeah.
And so really kind of hammering it over the period of a week was like not not the ideal way to play it.
That's rough.
But yeah, it's...
I took a whole week off to just do that. Yeah, like no job. I just had holiday and just Zelda and I felt like I barely made a dent on it, really.
I mean, as I was saying to someone, I think it was in the next issue, we had a reader who sort of said, thank you for your sacrifice kind of thing. I was like, well, you know, there are worse jobs than playing like 70 hours of Zelda in like a few days. Like, pity the poor guy who got Gollum to review, like, Jesus, like, that's, you know, that's the sacrifice, that's the real sacrifice.
I suppose since you've given it a 10, Chris, obviously it is such a dense game. What's your journey with Tears of the Kingdom been like since that review came out? You can just enjoy the breadth of it at your own leisure.
Oh, God, yeah, it's just nice to be able to kind of not sort of, I mean, what I tried to really, and I think it helped having kind of having done Breath of the Wild was that I spent a lot of the early time of the review session just messing about, like deliberately just kind of testing the limits of all these powers as much as I could, because I felt like that was getting a better flavor of the game than just like exclusively pursuing the story stuff, which you tend to do like when you're, you know, when you're really against the clock, you kind of like have to really rinse the story. And I ended up sort of like crunching that towards the end a little bit. But it was, yeah, definitely a lot of my early hours with that were just sort of messing about.
And then since it's just been kind of more messing about just really like maxing out my battery meter and just seeing what I can do. You know, the various powers and auto build and it's just such a, yeah, such a time saver. And then like just pursuing a lot of the side quests that we did, like there's a bit before the play intro in Edge where we have like still playing and like all three entries of this this next issue are all dedicated to Tears of the Kingdom.
It's just an excuse to kind of write a little bit more about it, about the stuff that I've enjoyed since then.
So yeah, yeah, it's a really interesting one because I think like more so than than any of the other like truly great Nintendo games that I've probably played in the last 10 years or whatever. It does take more time to bed in and you have to like learn it once you do. You realize like just how sort of exceptionally infinite a lot of it is, but your relationship with that game just changes so so drastically in Breath of the Wild.
I just don't think that's true of Breath of the Wild. I think like the core magic of that game makes yourself known very quickly.
I think if I'm honest, I think I think that's contributed to like I feel like the reviews of Breath of the Wild were probably on the whole slightly better than the Tears of the Kingdom one, because only since I wrote my review, I've read a lot of the other kind of coverage and there's only been like one or two that I think really kind of got to the core of what's special about it. Like, yeah, Simon Parkin did a really, really good piece for the New Yorker, which I feel like is one of the very few. And this is not to kind of like because I, you know, I don't think that I kind of quite managed like I don't think it's the best review I've ever written.
But I think there are just the same. Yeah, it's just the same. But, you know, like it is such, as you say, it's such a difficult game to pin down.
And I think the time constraints meant that a lot of people just had to kind of skate over the surface a little bit and not really kind of managed to really, really capture what makes it so special in a way that I think a lot of people kind of managed a little bit more more easily with Breath of the Wild.
Yeah, that's super interesting. Well, yeah, thanks for your insight there, Chris. So, yeah, that's we've come to the end of this episode.
Is there anything else you wanted to sort of like mention here, Chris, or plug the stuff you got coming up in Edge?
Yeah, next issue is we've got, I really can't say what it is, we've got a bonafide exclusive on the cover, which is really exciting from an established developer doing something that they're really good at. That's all I'll say about that, but it's a really exciting cover feature.
You're going to have to tell us when we stop recording this episode.
Yeah, we'll do. Yeah, absolutely. But yeah, I guess I just kind of want to give a shout out to various people who have not had a chance to sort of thank or kind of credit for, you know, my career so far.
Like there are so many people that have been, you know, influential on my career and just like particularly, I think Nathan and Jen during my time on Edge have just been super, you know, supportive in very different ways, kind of helping me become a better writer, I think those are two big ones and, you know, Alex as well, who I work with now is just an absolute joy to work with. So and you two, of course, it was always, always lovely to work with you.
That's right. Thank you.
I was just a very techie overworked editor, Chris, you don't need to thank me.
No, we've always, always said it, one of the most reliable in the biz and I think reliable sometimes comes with us. It feels like a bit of an underhand compliment of like sort of reliable, safe, but you are just so technically reliable and a great writer and thinker about games. Like honestly, Chris, you've like an absolute boom throughout my times on Mags.
Yeah, likewise.
Thank you. That really, really does mean a lot.
Well, with the backpacking done, we can wrap up this episode. It's been so great to have you on Chris. So thanks so much for your insight and for sharing a little bit of a snapshot of what it's like on Edge magazine.
We really appreciate it. So we definitely encourage people to go and check it out if you're not Red Edge for a while. And I think we've sold a few Edge subscriptions through this podcast, according to our Discord.
Did we get e-commerce on that?
No, we didn't put an affiliate link in there. So we fucked it. We fucked it, frankly.
We learnt nothing from Fujifilm.
Yeah, that was like the whole thing. Chris, where can people get you on social media?
Yes, I'm at Schilling C on Twitter. That's about it, really.
Awesome. Yeah, so I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter.
Matthew, where are you?
At MrBazzleHunderscorePesto.
