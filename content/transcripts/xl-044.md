Hello, and welcome to the Backpage X L, a patron exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello, Matthew. Have you seen Predator Badlands yet? I don't know if that was on your list to see this weekend, but uh I know you're on a Bit of a movie watching spree, so I thought I'd ask anyway.

Matthew
00:38
I haven't seen it, I'm afraid. Um what did I watch? I watched Header The Header Gabbler, uh adaptation by Nia DeCosta. Oh yeah. And uh I watched Ron Howard's Eden, which was absolute shit.

Samuel
00:53
Isn't Eton like the infamous stinker from this year? It's got loads of like quite famous people in it, but it's meant to be rubber.

Matthew
00:59
Oh. Anodoramus can be good in things, but I th th I think this is this is the like some of the worst acting I've seen in a film for a long time. It's kind of embarrassing.

Samuel
01:08
I hate that when you're sort of cringing for them. She might be someone who needs a new agent. She's got that kind of vibe, you know what I mean? And a sort of reset. But she has got the stuff.

Matthew
01:16
Like when she's with the right director, she she can definitely deliver

Samuel
01:20
Well, interesting. Well, um Predator Badlands was a bit disappointing, to be honest, as someone who enjoyed prey and wasn't expecting more of the same, but did think, oh, this is a guy who you know, knows what he's doing with this material. And it is a bit of a bold kind of attempt to do something different with um with Predator. And I'm sure I think the usual people who get upset about all media these days, aka right wing psychos, um have gotten to a bit of a, you know, tizzy about this. But Predator is an ass franchise. There's lots of shit. Predator films. So I'm I'm kind of all for someone doing something a bit different. But Just doesn't totally work unfortunately. It's a lot of like predator blokes yelling at each other in a predator voice with those predator mouths and It's a bit of a bad hang for our old film, um, a a Predator. So uh didn't quite tick the box unfortunately. Good L fanning performance though, so uh you know Isn't it just like half an L fanning? You get half of L Fanning, but there's actually like two L fannings in it. There's like a

Matthew
02:16
What?

Samuel
02:16
Yeah. Sorry, you and Catherine do that say what sometimes every now and then it just takes me uh I get taken aback by it. Um yeah, you get like a sort of Uh well-behaved L-fanning, then a slightly more terse L fanning. So you get um I don't think that's a spoiler to say, um, because I don't I haven't given you any context for how they're used in the film, but You get renegade and paragon L fanning. It's a little bit like that, yeah. It's sort of like business L fanning and then sort of like um in declub L fanning, I guess. That is not really the vibe at all, but um I've just ever since I've seen In the Club written down with K L E uh Triple R B, I now just have been saying that aloud for about two weeks. So um My brain has been poisoned by the interest 'cause I believe that's a mega Galopolis thing, right?

Matthew
03:03
It sure is, yeah. Yeah. I refuse to give that that film any meme fuel. It should not be remembered as a fun time for anything. No. Like I refuse to throw it that bone.

Samuel
03:13
It was a bad hang. Um but you know what's not a bad hang, Matthew? Mary Galaxy 2. So that's a segue. Absolute fucking sledgehammer segue there. Um I hope you enjoyed that. Um so you may remember that on Friday we put out an episode called Two Giant Men Play Super Mario Galaxy and we promised that we do a follow-up episode of Married Galaxy 2. Again that I've now finished for the first time. So um this is the sequel episode. I found it very satisfying doing these two episodes back to back, Matthew. How about you? It's a good Good little concentrated bit of potty, isn't it?

Matthew
03:41
Uh as good a reason as any to go back and play two of my favourite games of all time, see if they they hold up. Spoiler alert, they both did for me. So um, but we can get into that.

Samuel
03:51
Yeah, for sure. So you know I I I on on the train back from Troybridge where I ate a jacket potato. at uh at a cafe called Boswell's. Um it's become like a bit of a ritual now. It's like nine quid, which I think is actually quite steep for a potato, um, with s with like chili and cheese. Um but it's very comforting during these like cold months. Um I do that and then I come back and then on the train of the cuc we just made these episodes I just start pelting you with like we could do this we could do that Um And I was wondering how how insane that drives you me, just pitching new pods as we come off the back of making very, very onerous pods like these ones.

Matthew
04:24
I I mean I love that you do all the heavy lifting. That's fantastic for me, 'cause I can just sit there and and just do h thumbs up and thumbs down emojis like some lazy emperor. That's fantastic. Yeah, it's good. I don't want to overcommit just playing like old games, because I want to play a lot of new games. Um, that's the balance I have to strike. I think I'm maybe more interested in mainlining lots of new games than you are. Do you think that's fair?

Samuel
04:49
Yeah, I think so, but in my head I'm like, you only need ten for the end of your list, so it's not hugely important to play more than like fifteen or twenty. Whereas I think you're like Well I want a pool of like fifty to get the right ten. That's like crazy though. That's insane. That's just that's too many. That's like your whole all of your spare time is signed over then to to just playing games, which I it's all about the balance, isn't it? It's all about fitting in all the different media that interests us, you know?

Matthew
05:13
I don't have any jacket potato time in my life. So you know, I've I've clawed back a good couple of hours a week just not eating a potato in Boswells.

Samuel
05:24
Yeah, Boswells. It's not a very glamorous name, is it, is it Boswells? Gives a bit of a vibe of like Ian Beale's calf about it, I will say, um, in East Enders. Um yeah, I'm not sure. Oh it's still there, isn't it? Uh it's right near my flat and near the old um trading card game shop where I went in just to buy those Final Fantasy cards when that was like a whole thing. But um they're no longer in stock so that's uh that's exited my life as a concern Matthew. What games which thank you. Which games have you do you feel like you've missed out on as you've been playing old games this year? How how how much have you still got left to play before game of the year?

Matthew
06:00
off the top of my head couldn't couldn't name anything. But I've got a s I've got lots of things in my, you know, stream list and things sort of half completed and half finished. It's more that it's more about finishing off some things which I was really enjoying but have put aside. You know I've got Death Stranding 2 begging to be finished. Am I gonna play more Iote? Probably not. The ongoing hundred line project, which is just I mean, i uh that will hang over me f forever more. Um yeah, that's tough.

Samuel
06:33
That's very much become the kind of like cult favorite of the year, hundred line. Like the the one that the podcast has discussed that has also become like a bigger deal elsewhere. And we've got um an episode in December where someone who has finished a hundred line, um a returning guest, is gonna come on and talk about uh that game with Matthew.

Matthew
06:50
So that's gonna come on and tell me off for not having finished.

Samuel
06:54
But it's just gonna be a two-hour scolding. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that one. But um yeah, my end of year prep is sort of like the reason I'm I'm talking about old games, I feel like I do have a pretty solid 10. And I'm s uh there's a few things I'm sort of noodling away at, but I look at the ten and I'm like, there's some good variety there. And I'll probably play like two to three more things on on the side. But otherwise I don't know, I feel pretty settled and I I do like having i empty pockets of time to play old stuff and that's kinda what this was really, you know.

Matthew
07:21
That that is true and I I do get that, but you know, I also I you know, I look at my current ten and Th there's no real sort of surprises in there. Like I you know, I like to try and try and find something a bit off the the you know beaten track for, you know, the tenth position in the list or something. Uh you know, and often i i I find at this end of the year period when people start putting up their lists actually, you know, a couple of winners do emerge or things that are like right up your street that you've happened to miss out on. You know, last year like Xeno Tilt could slightly pass me by despite really liking z uh Demon's Tilt. and um mini shoot adventures came from the same place just a a really good recommendation so uh yeah that's that's that's kind of what I want yeah So you don't know. But at the same time, if if none of those games are better than the ten I've currently got, I'm not gonna shunt them out. Because I don't do that.

Samuel
08:23
Yes, of of course you don't. Um what will be the mini shoot adventures that um get Um Death Stranding 2 or Ghost of Yote expelled from the list yes this year.

Matthew
08:35
Yeah. Yeah. You play more about than me, so I don't know. Yeah, uh but Uh death shredding is it's the p it's the positioning. That's the thing that gets me. It's like, what is my favorite game this year? I don't have like a you know, a clear at you know, out of the front of the pack type game at the moment. Yeah. So Yeah, I get you.

Samuel
08:57
It's it is a bit tougher. Also, I think because of the amount of what we've been playing episodes we do now. It makes it harder to to be that surprise game Or like I think you like two to three surprise games in your list. Oh I do like a little surprise, yeah. You like to am I always have like one, but you always have like a few and you're like, you never even heard of this game and here it is in my list. That's uh You definitely take pride in that. And so I think um yeah, it's it's a much more intense period for you. Whereas I feel like I'm kind of done. I sort of still want you to play No I'm not a human as well, which feels very Castle adjacent, you know.

Matthew
09:29
Yeah, that's that's that's on the list. What normally happens is that in like the last third of the year, if we've got any what we've been playing, if I play anything That's a little bit odd and really good. I might just sit on it, like park the discussion into a top ten. So I've got like a nice little reveal. But I actually haven't had any of those. Like all the things I've talked about, you know You know, it's they're kind of out there, you know, like I I didn't want to sit on Absalom, you know.

Samuel
09:54
Yeah, same boat actually. So um some games as well. I've like started earmarking alternative game of the year awards for where I'm like, that'll be a great bant, so I'd better not use that band before we get to the episode. So I'm sort of like banking content on that in in that respect. Um okay I'll look forward to that Matthew. I always get excited about December when we make the podcast. I think we always um we always enjoy that process and the reveals, so Um Yeah, should be good. It's as inevitable as Mariah Carey at this point, really. Um, the top ten process. Um so then this episode, two Giant Men plays Super Mario Galaxy 2. So, like last time, I'm gonna do a bit of background here based on the Awata Us that I've read most of. I didn't read the sound bit of it, I read the half of the sound bit of it. And but Matthew and I sort of get the idea. Uh, you know, sort of like Koji Kondo and um who's the other guy? Uh this is Bruce or yeah, like those guys always sound a little bit like We almost got left out or worry they'll be left out or like that they're off to the side doing their own thing um just based on reading um reading these Um so that was funny. This time there was a a part where they um one of them mentioned to a water like, I thought you weren't even going to interview us this time because it wasn't on the schedule or something. And then the other and then Watter's like, uh no, I really wanted to, so I'm glad we're doing this. That was funny.

Matthew
11:12
Yeah, that's only 'cause they had a C D they gave away. You could get like the soundtrack on you know, Club Mary or whatever. So I feel like they had to do that interview just to promote the C D. Oh yeah.

Samuel
11:24
That's funny. Just because it it's sort of like a sequel um to the anecdote about not being invited to the um the rap party last time. So sort of like just ve sound people being wronged or ignored is like just a a funny little strain of these um Iwata as so Yes, the starting point for Sea of Mario Galaxy 2, Matthew, was to make a relatively quick sequel using the same engine, basically not wasting the groundwork they did for the original game. This was variously called or at least thought of as Super Mario Galaxy 1. 5 or more Super Mario Galaxy, and comparisons were made to Majora's Mask in terms of the type of project it was supposed to be and how it would be a relatively expedited development. However, they kept chucking in more and more new stuff and it grew into a full sequel. And initi initially they started out using discarded ideas like Yoshi. and a planet um shaped like Mario's head, both intended for the original game, but didn't quite make it in there. However, as time went on, um it's it it seemed like the any kind of remixed or recycled content from the original game kind of got pushed out in favor of an entirely new game. And development was actually, you know, it was a it's pretty lengthy in the end. I think they did sit on the finished version of this for a little while, Matthew, because They didn't want it to clash with another Mario game that was around the same time. Um maybe I'm thinking of um New Super Mario Bros here. So they might have had it done. By end of 2009 and then just sat on it for a little while till um till it released in 2010. So I think that's right. I think that's a detail I picked up in the What to Ask. But I wanted to talk about the idea of, you know, its its origins as this sort of like remix project or like level pack or whatever it was supposed to be. What do you make of that?

Matthew
13:01
Yeah, it feels like that thinking maybe comes out of the endgame of Mario Galaxy 1, which as discussed in the last episode, is a lot of remix levels. They use these prankster comets. And I I mean that's that's Th that's the implication I read into the interview anyway. This idea of, well, we you know, we managed to squeeze all these extra co you know, stars out of these levels. Why don't we just do these levels again but with slightly different modifiers and whatnot? you know, maybe more like almost like Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels, you know, like a like the hard version of everything you you're already familiar with. But yeah, I mean What is impressive is to go from that to, like you say, how little repeated material there actually is in this. You know, I I I think bar Like one of the special worlds right at the end of the game is like a boss rush of bosses from the first game. You know, where they you do like six of them in a row. But outside of that, I don't think there's anything directly lifted from that first game at all.

Samuel
14:12
No, I don't think so. I think as well, like anytime there's an allusion to the first game, it's it's using original content. It's a whole new level they built. using, you know, a transformation from the first game or revisiting a a level type or an idea. Um there's all it's all new stuff. So yeah, that you know, whatever they they may have intended at the very start. That's just completely gone from the finish product. Yeah.

Matthew
14:45
I'm not saying that they can do a Metal Gear Solid 2 twist at the end of this game and go, You are actually doing Shadow Moses all over again. But like This was VR. It's all in VR uh But there is you know it's like oh here's the level which is like fire and ice together And here's the level where, you know, the colour palette and the music is very similar to Gusty Garden Galaxy and it kind of hits like that. You know, I think there's There's lots of stuff which feels almost like a sidestep from something which existed in Mario Galaxy 1. Um w you know, which is which is quite interesting. Like whether they just you know, by drilling into those concepts in the first game realized, oh, this is just a good colour palette, or visually this works really well for this game, or there's more mileage in that idea, but we don't just want to return to the same level. That jumped out to me more this time. This is this is the time this is the closest I've ever played one and two together. So that stuff's felt like a bit more a bit more obvious, you know, like there's literally like a you know, a honey hive galaxy sort of stand in and boom, Aria turns up in the same place. You know, there's a level which is very like The Battle Rock Galaxy, you know, like a big metal spaceship sort of metallic looking thing and that stuff I'd never really noticed before. So You can sort of see those roots.

Samuel
16:05
Yeah, and every now and then there is something that is just plain, recycled from the original. Like they still have the same single animation of um Mario getting a star. Um which, you know, you see a lot. I mean there is a a variant when you've got Yoshi with you. Um and uh actually am I saying Yoshi correctly there, Matthew? Is it Yoshi? How are you supposed to say this before I say it right? Yoshi's island Yoshi's Island. Yoshi. Yoshi. Okay. I think I say Yoshi. So I'll try and stick to that as we go. Um, you know, just things like that or even bits of music. They're not shy about reusing bits of music. I know that's something they talk about in the Iwateras a little bit as well. Um, you know, because if it ain't broke, don't fix it to some extent. You know, you might as well recycle when it's like, you know, low impact in the gameplay experience to recycle. And so I think that um you're right that the you know you will see variants of things you've seen before, but that feels like them just playing with the toy box they've got to some extent. Um and probably because um you know part of how they designed the game we'll talk about this is that they created a rudimentary level editor for the developers um so different types of game developers who weren't necessarily uh you know like the uh uh level designers you know by trade um could throw ideas into the board and articulate what those ideas would look like. And so that's um you know that's another way in which it changes. But yeah, I agree that it's uh you know many elements of it are familiar, but um all of it is remixed basically. Uh it seems like one of the things that Miyamoto stamped out of this game was any story, Matthew. As a result, it is oddly light on context even compared to the original Marriott Galaxy, which doesn't have loads of story, but does pause every now and then. um to have like a character say something to you or um you know it does at least establish what is going on in the in the story. It's basically just a repeat of the story. Like, you know, it's the same old Mario story. You know, Peach has been kidnapped. But There's some sort of vague sci-fi Rosalina stuff in the first game, the Comet Observatory, a feeling that someone's trying to build a world and a context. that feels completely stripped out of this. It sounds like producer Yoshiaki Koizumi was responsible for the narrative element being the guy behind Link's Awakening story, you know, which is a b one of the more notable Nintendo stories for sure. I wonder what you made of the showdown Miyamoto described around this, which sounded like it was a Outside the office, two guys having a heart to heart, maybe. Um and how it affects the finished product.

Matthew
18:34
Yeah, that's quite a weird beat in this interview, the story of taking Kazumi out for a dinner cause that you know it sounds quite serious. Look there's almost a there's almost a hint of like should Miyamoto be telling us that he had this? It's like listen I gotta sit this guy down and like set him straight because he doesn't get it. You know, he takes it in quite good humor, because obviously Kazumi isn't in the Miyamoto interview. He turns like he's in a different batch of people. Um so he so you kind of you get to hear both sides sort of rashomon style. Uh you know, I I wonder, I mean obviously this is made in parallel with new Super Mario Bros. Wii, uh which, you know, comes out before Mario Galaxy 2, after Mario Galaxy 1. but is absolutely enormous and it's quite a like stripped back game itself. Like it you know that you know it doesn't really have any story. You know it's what it's it's like the older Mario Brothers games, it just sort of gets straight into it and I wonder if Miyamoto's quite sort of empowered by that approach of like, well that's what people clearly like because this is just done so well. And maybe that motivates some of this. But yeah, I think the idea of just yeah, not getting in the way of the game, not slowing it down. There's some quite interesting stuff where he talks about very specific tone of storytelling and not having any like language or lines in it which are like embarrassing or like embarrassing to older players. There's almost a bit where he makes a case for like there should be low cringe in Mario. He doesn't say cringe, 'cause this is like ten years before I think people were were throwing that around loads. But the bit where he sort of says like, uh you don't want to hear like a babyish guy saying like talking about his mummy or whatever, he's like, that would be terrible. So I like the idea of him sort of spelling all this stuff out, you know, for his story guy, obviously thinking that the stuff in Married Galaxy was a bit over the top. Married Galaxy is not a story heavy game by any stretch of the imagination. But it almost is two-story heavy at the same time. Like whenever there is anything that gets in the way of it, on a replay, that stuff is always quite jarring. It's the bits I want to skip. Like the beginning is quite slow.

Samuel
20:44
It feels like a much shorter game, Mary Galaxy 2, as a result, because it just doesn't feel like the pace is being artificially stretched out by anything. However, I do wonder if they maybe went a bit too far in this direction and Miyamoto got his own way a bit too much with the finished product. Because I think it even did get some criticism of the story in this game or the lack thereof. from some critics who are like, well, there's just like no context here at all really. It's just like a big stack of levels. And I i almost like something lighter touch than the first game, but not so light touch. It's basically like Well, you know, off you go. It's uh I may I wonder if there's just some some solution that wasn't totally Miyamoto getting his own way. I don't know what you thought of that.

Matthew
21:27
And what is interesting is that obviously you get 3D land and 3D world after this, which are, I would say, equally stripped back. You know, there's there's not a lot going on there. But It by the time you get to Odyssey, that begins to ha almost have like story beats interwoven into the gameplay. Like there are bits where your ship crashes at the start of levels and you have to you know, achieve a certain goal before you can start exploring that level more freely. They learn to make it kind of a bit more interactive and they can kind of slow down the pace of the game in game rather than just using cutscenes and it it almost like that that idea doesn't dawn on them this early on. Um, you know, which y you could almost see of, you know The Mario spaceship shaped like his head is quite similar to the top hat that flies around the world in Odyssey in terms of sort of just like look and vibe. And you could see them like maybe throwing in some bits where the head goes off and Dana gets stuck in a black hole or something, and Mario's to do something to save it or does something to kinda change the pace so it isn't just like level level level level level. Yeah. Which is very much the feeling you you come away with. And I I think 'cause they've streamlined it in other ways as well. The way the level map works. the nature of some of the challenges, the length of some of the levels, the whole thing can like rush by or kind of like rush over you. You know, I remember feeling that when I reviewed it originally. I remember you know, I when I reviewed Marriott Galaxy 1, I didn't get all 120 stars in the the three days of reviewing it, but I did on Marriott Galaxy 2. And it just felt not designed to be a bit easier, but just they'd sort of removed so many rough edges that I guess, yeah, there is maybe a question now of does it actually need a bit more friction in a few places.

Samuel
23:21
Yeah, it's funny because I I got me thinking about how Bonanza has like quite a lot of story as well, considering what it is, you know, relative to a Nintendo game. And, you know, I don't think anyone would really you know, I I didn't think the cutscenes were like hugely substantial, but they certainly weren't offensive. They didn't really feel like a a a pacebreaker. They kind of they are in Mario Galaxy. I think it's just a very specific way that they're like a full stop after each level. Whereas in Bonanza, it's like that thing you're saying about Odyssey where It feels woven into the actual game experience, so the stories happening while you're on an adventure, not the bits in between, which is the problem with Galaxy Structure. But Yeah, I do wonder then maybe if that the um the EAD team got the last laugh here, Matthew, because um Miyamoto's off designing theme parks and they get to put their little bits of story in their games. But I don't know.

Matthew
24:12
I think an interview came out just today actually, uh talking about like forty years of Mario and he said, Oh these days, you know, like I'll play the first half an hour of a game. just to make sure it's got that like Mario flavour and just to sort of check it out and that feels very different to you know, here I think he's talking about going through it like line by line and doing like a full dialogue check on it and being very engaged with it and playtesting every level like I I I think over the years Miyamoto's part in Marriott Galaxy I've definitely forgotten that Like I I'd sort of thought, oh, it's just the EAD lot. Not going rogue, but like, you know, it's quite a self-contained thing and these interviews are uh you know, one of the the th you know, the things which is quite useful about them is just remembering that he this is probably the last time he was seriously hands on.

Samuel
25:05
Yeah. It's um haha, it's funny, it's a sort of sequel to our discussion from last time. I will note that um Hayashida in the photos like with the Wataras here, Hayashida being your guy, um and you know, more senior on this project because um Koizumi w was the producer here rather than the director, right? So I think there was some um change around there. But he's also like wearing a suit and looks proper, sort of like business guy in the photos in a way that he looks much more casual. in the first set of interviews. Um I can sort of see the narrative in your head forming as I look at these photos, basically. That that kind of amused me. Um but you know that's um that's a a change as well. So uh Koizumi's like a step further removed from you know where he was last time and you know it is it is a a deepening of that younger generation sort of like taking control of the um of the series. Um younger generation at the time, these are probably all like um forty and fifty um something um people now um such is the nature of time. Um but I did want to ask you about the specific process of creating levels for this game, Matthew, because you know, I ideas is a it's a word that they use a lot when discussing this game. It's like a game completely powered by ideas and it was You know, there were regular uh meetings in which anyone from any team could pitch different ideas for the game. As mentioned, there was this rudimentary level editor that could later be um sort of like uh uh sort of polished off by the planning team if uh a level was successful. Um and they talk about how you know it is unfair when designers would pitch ideas. because they can make the idea seem better by offering drawings alongside them, which, you know, if you can't draw, then, you know, you don't have that in in your arsenal. You kind of just have to explain these things. But That was that seemed like a marked difference from the first game as well. Just how the ideas were were generated and how they were implemented. I wonder if you have any thoughts on that.

Matthew
26:55
I think I said in that last episode that this this sort of becomes the the model going forward. Definitely in 3D land and 3D world they talk a lot about pulling from the whole team and it and it just becoming the nature of EAD and then it's something Hey Ashida takes over to the 2D Marios in Super Mario Wonder, he you know, he basically encourages everyone to put ideas on like post it notes, has a big wall of ideas and you know, a great idea can come from anywhere and ideas can be amplified and it can become great things, you know, the the the famous narrative in 3D world is the the the emergence of like the Captain Toad levels, you know, an idea which starts small but becomes so popular. that it becomes its own standalone game. That's kind of, I think, sort of Heyashida's whole deal is is like how far can one of these ideas go? So yeah, certainly the idea of opening it up to everyone, having software which lets them kind of prototype things. Elsewhere, so not in the Water Ass interview, but I I dug up some later sort of Heyashida interviews 'cause there are a few quotes which I'd thought he'd said in Those A Water Ass, but I c I couldn't actually find him talking about them. Um and I think they were in some other interviews he did around like GDC and things like that. And uh he was talking about for him a big change between Mario Galaxy One and Mario Galaxy Two was trying to give levels uh like an idea which was more of a through line rather than using freedom and illogical nature of space to just attach just loads of random good bits together into one galaxy run. You know, he become he he says, oh, we actually really wanted to focus on like you know, let's see one idea through from start to finish in every level rather than just have, you know, a scatter shot of things. Let let's try and make it a bit a a bit more coherent and you know, we can get into this when we get into talking about the game proper, but you know, I definitely think that comes through here and I wonder as well if that's just part of this this process, you know, a good idea comes out and rather than sandwiching it between two random ideas and calling it the clutter galaxy or whatever, they just go, Well that's that you know, and and because of that you end up with you know maybe slightly more galaxies in this game, but maybe ideas which are a bit more sort of focused and linear and maybe have less sort of scope to them at times. But This to me just is now what so many of these Mario games are like that it just seems very natural to me. I s you know, I don't have a problem with this approach. You know, I think I'm more a fan of the scatter shot than I am, let's bet on like ten big land masses.

Samuel
29:43
The thing is, I I uh you know, I'm a big fan of Space Junk Galaxy in the first game, um which is basically just a bunch of stuff floating in space. Um because I think visually that has its own kind of identity. But yeah, it's true that um, you know, you y you get f you don't get as much of the experience of You know, it happens sometimes, but you're like you're in a you're in a landmass in three different levels, and each time you go to that landmass, something different will happen. It does feel there are some galaxies like that in this game, but that feels like it's the foundation of the original Merrick Galaxy. Um, and those spaces feel a lot felt a lot larger as well. and maybe did have some more extraneous um bits to them that this game just really just uh you know uh shears down. It's not immediately noticeable, but it's something you notice when you play these games back to back. It's Fewer areas for you to just sort spend time in and get lost in. Like the um the first B galaxy in the first Mario Galaxy Matthew. um whatever that was called. That big area. Honey hive. That feels like a massive area, that initial area compared to what the places you go to in this game, for example. Like that was And that maybe that's sort of an example of the kind of focus you're talking about. When I talked about compare that level to a banjo Kazooie level, it's because it feels more like a hub. than, you know, like a linear platform experience or like an A to B sort of like set piece driven, you know, platform experience in the way that, you know, a lot of the Maybe some of the more memorable Mario Galaxy games do feel like that, you know? So yeah. Um well I've got more to talk about on this front, but I want to talk about some of the other changes that the developers thought about with this sequel. So One pretty obvious change is the difference in camera. They seem to acknowledge that the camera wasn't perfect in the first game. I talked a lot about that camera in the first episode that we did. Um I was very impressed by um the sort of like almost, you know, photographer or artist or film director like way in which they thought about the camera and where it was placed and how they use that, even if sometimes it came at the expense of readability. Um it didn't seem to pass them by, Matthew, that um that that did create some problems for players. And so they thought about that um a lot. And so you get a little bit more of of a traditional 3D camera in places in this game, um which does change the look of it. Um and as mentioned they got rid of the Comet Observatory and all of its bad hangs. Um still a lot of staff Mario has, but they'll they'll live on his little Mario head in this one. Um and so yeah, I I just wanted to know what you thought about the different lessons E EAD team took away from the first game in general.

Matthew
32:15
The camera one Seems to be they identify that as being like the hurdle for for people. Uh you know, that that's that's the one which decides basically whether or not you can stomach 3D Mario or not. So this idea of like if you can fix that camera somehow, or if you can make the camera completely sort of y you know, unobtrusive, then you know, maybe that's the key to kind of unlocking the Sales success that 2D New Super Mario Brothers, you know, Wii has had in the DS1 and you know things like that. And You know, I c I could think of maybe like three or four times that I actually had to adjust the camera in this, which is probably a good indicator of you sort of how many you know, how often the camera is is framing the action really well. The way it follows you around spheres, the game's general use of spheres, like is maybe you know, is maybe less ambitious than Mario Galaxy One. You know, th it's not just a better camera, it's maybe the actual nature of the game has changed to make it slightly easier to frame. There are levels which are, you know, literally 2D as in you don't have 3D movement in them where it's side on, but there are a lot more bits which are Still fully 3D gameplay, but the camera is a fixed side on perspective and you can't move it and so it it's sort of framing the game in a 2D way or a simpler way you know, of just like, well, your eye can kind of follow this in the same way that it should be able to follow a two D Mario level and when you play them close together you do realize that the camera is a bit more unhinged in the first one, but also has a bit more ambition and style to it. But then the journey through Galaxy 2, for me at least, is just so buttery smooth that I'm like, well, this is probably a win, all told.

Samuel
34:05
It's interesting as well because they changed the um by design they changed the visual palette of the game. Like they they no longer wanted it to be like dark space. They was more like blue sky. was the f a phrase that came up a few times in the So Water Ass, Matthew. And you do notice it, like, even if you're in space, it finds ways to give you some quite um quite warm environments and um maybe a little bit downplay the sort of like cold nature of space as uh as a place and and maybe tie it a bit more specifically to what? um Mario has traditionally been um in terms of like you know a colour palette um visually. So that's um interesting too. Yeah, I mean I have stronger thoughts on the camera that I'll come back to, but just interesting to see them how they think about that because I don't they what they never talk about in the Ottawa Ars is about is the idea of the camera being used as like create something creative as opposed to something functional. And I do think that's what is distinctive about the way it's used in the first game. It's just it's it's part of their tool set visually. And it is part of the visual identity. And I said on the episode, if you gave him Mario uh a traditional 3D camera, that visual uh that layer of visual identity would be removed. And I think that it does remove something from this game. I'm not saying that it means the game is bad necessarily, but it is a it's a a marks difference, I would say. Um but maybe again it's something you only notice when you play these back to back um for two podcast episodes as I have Um so I was wondering what you thought on of their takes on the difficulty as discussed in this interview, Matthew. So it seems slightly all over the place. The way they um They discuss it is that they expect returning players to understand how their mechanics work. So as you go through the levels in this game, you see a lot of these screens that explain how to do things, or there'll be characters who tell you how to do things. And Some of those might be moves that you did in the first game or like abilities or whatever it might be. And other bits will be like new mechanics to explain. But it means there's no like forced tutorial element to it and um that's kind of an interesting choice but I found the way the developers talked about difficulty to be a bit muddled because this is a game with a reputation for being a bit harder than the first one. But they seem determined to still make it work for new players. But they acknowledge it's gonna be there's gonna be a big veteran um set of players coming in. Uh this is actually the only time I read these interviews and thought there was a bit of contradiction going on in what they were saying. And I think the end result shows that You know, maybe I think maybe that New Super Mario Bros success on Wii in 2009 was a bit of a factor here because you know that is a game that famously had some elements to make it easier for you the player to get through. And this game is obviously a a 3D g a 3D game with a sci-fi setting. It's a it's maybe a little bit a slightly harder sale than that game was. Um and indeed it sold, you know, many fewer copies. Just wondering what you thought about their discussion or difficulty here, Matthew, and whether you found it as muddled as I did.

Matthew
37:01
It is smudded, you know, they're torn between not wanting to scare off a bigger new audience who hasn't played 3D Mario or doesn't feel as comfortable with 3D Mario. But they also want to keep galaxy veterans excited by making you think, oh, it's gonna sort of pick up at a spicy level, you know, where you left off with Mario Galaxy 1. Um, I definitely think the difficulty is pitched a little higher at the start than it is in Galaxy One. I think Galaxy One maybe has some like more frustrating peaks than Galaxy Two. Again we can get into that in in part two. I think they have made it a smoother journey through and then that ties into like the the speed at which you play it. Yeah, the the weird thing with the difficulty conversation is that I think new Super Mario Bros. Wii is quite hard. Often 2D Mario for me is harder than 3D Mario. I haven't played Super Mario Bros. Wii in a long time. But, you know, the uh the DS ones were the DS one was was quite a pushover, but that one I thought was gave me more grief. than anything in Galaxy 2. Uh I think someone even says that in one of these interviews. He's like, you know, I know this game sold loads, but I actually I actually think that is harder than this game we've made.

Samuel
38:19
I I found the quote by the way, just because I thought it might be useful context here. So It's part of an extended conversation about the idea that of comparing Mario to an instrument and or like a guitar. A guitar specifically and the idea that If you can play a few chords, it's like a beginner element too using a guitar, but to obviously master it, it requires a lot more um you know a lot more effort and and time. Um, so uh yeah, so Koizumi says, I think everyone wants to play a musical instrument well and they want to play Mario well, but they can't do it right away. Nonetheless, that feeling of wanting to do it well is the same. Some people may feel like Super Mario Galaxy 2 looks like it's more difficult than Super Mario Bros. Wii, but the essence is the same. The musical instrument that is Mario, so while there may be several more strings, if you play until your hands become accustomed to it. You'll be able to play the way you want. And then there's a m uh Motakura quote. This is just my own personal impression, but I think new Super Mario Bros. Wii is a more difficult game. I actually think there are plenty of stages in Super Mario Galaxy 2 that people who um can only handle one or two strings can clear fairly easily. There really aren't that many control buttons, and it is after all a Mario game just like the others. So I think people who have played the 2D games will be able to find some enjoyment in the world of 3D Mario as well. And we'll quickly get deep into it. I mean So Just quite an interesting conversation there because yeah, I mean I I I agree, like if you fall down a fucking fall down to the abyss in in Mario, it feels like that happens in 2D Mario like a hell of a lot. um for example. And um yeah, and it's sort of like you have it feels like you have more tools at your disposal to avoid that happening to you in this game because you're moving in a 3D space. You have his little spin, you have his wall jumps, you have multiple surfaces you can wall jump off of. He has his little climb mechanics as well when he's like on the edge of a wall but not quite able to get it. So Yeah, you might be right. Exactly. So yeah, that's you know, it's it's perhaps a fair point, but there is also like a big assist mode thing to new Super Mario Bros. Wii, right? Like the Uh was there a thing that they added that like an AI helper or something that would help you get through the level, so I remember this being a thing.

Matthew
40:27
Plus the multiplayer mode, the idea was that, you know, you could like pick people up and carry them through the hard bits. I th I always found playing that game in multiplayer an absolute nightmare because it just meant You know, on top of all the natural obstacles they've designed, there are three human bastards in the mix trying to like fuck you up and get in the way. That's what made that game really hard. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's uh it's a strange thing. All this talk of instruments is now just make I want an interview where they say which instrument each Nintendo hero is. 'Cause they talk about Mario being string, so I'm guessing they're thinking guitar in terms of their their own metaphor. He talks about learning the guitar. I want to know what instrument Mario is.

Samuel
41:09
Banjo or something.

Matthew
41:11
Or just like a trombone.

Samuel
41:13
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Just something with a or a French horn, something with a comedy noise kind of like element to it. Yeah, so uh just interesting to see them talk about this, because I find it a bit muddled, because I think that like difficulty spikes are kind of part of the Part of all of the different Mario games really. Um they just and and where they appear and where they don't appear, but they all have them to some degree. Um it was new Super Mario Bros. Wii that introduced the super guide, Matthew, to get you through the game 'Cause I remember at the time that a a PR from Rockstar called me asking what I thought of this feature and w I don't remember exactly what the context was, but um LA Noir has a feature similar to it and I wondered if they were asking because that game would later have.

Matthew
42:00
The dream. Imagine Vice City where you don't have to play all the horrible levels. Yeah. It just completes itself.

Samuel
42:08
God bless ya. All of the time you could have got back this summer, Matthew Um so an interesting technical restriction element to the development of this game, they wanted to have levels transform more. Um so the idea that a level would change while you're playing it. But due to technical restrictions, you only got bits of that in the final game. A really notable and visually extraordinary example is a fiery lake that you hit a bun and it instantly freezes over. And the music changes as well. It's just fucking amazing to be honest, as a as a little thing that they do. Um some of the games do change in some interesting ways while you play them. Um not all to amazing effect, but Um I can think of another level, for example, where inception style a wall folds up and you're but you're on like um a liquid surface so it's like you know, the world around you is kind of becoming a cube even though you're on a t a type of water. That's pretty um that's maybe a sign of what they were trying to do as well. I was wondering how noticeable you think that intent is in the final game, Matthew

Matthew
43:06
I mean when he says it, you can definitely find examples of it and go, oh yeah, I get that, but there there isn't really a through line. Like there are there are lots of bits in this where you think Like a tenth of this game is that. And you know, so they obviously had enough ideas to put on their big ideas board to make it, you know, worthwhile including those. But you know, I I I feel like the you know, if there is any through line in their mind, it's maybe Yoshi in terms of his prevalence, you know, on the packaging and that he's there. But I don't think you'd say this is like the ma the Yoshi Mario Galaxy at all. Like, I'd say there's as much Yoshi as there is levels which transform. Yeah. You also get the hint in They uh I think there's another interview actually where they talk about some of the transformations Mario has in this. There was a point where they were like, oh we were thinking of using lots of animals, they say Like there was gonna maybe be a bull Mario, which I think a bull of some kind, which becomes Boulder Mario. And they talk about birds, which are obviously included in the game game, 'cause you have the levels where you sort of hang from those birds and fly down the levels. Um so yeah, you like you know, given that this does start off with quite a broad remit of Just Make More Galaxy you can see that they have had conversations of uh is the theme animals? Is it Yoshi? Is it transforming levels? And there are bits of it. I'd say there are enough clumps of ideas in this that you can sort of s sort of tell what they were thinking at different times, but I don't think it's really like manifested in the final game. The final game does just feel like, you know, here's 120 things. Um Yeah, but I and and that w that was my read on it anyway.

Samuel
44:59
Yeah, I can sort of see that. I think that you uh yes, maybe a narrative you only sort of pull out um by reading this and then maybe thinking about it retroactively. I will say that the the Fiery Lake freezing over feels like such a big swing. It feels like such a big moment when it happens that it is almost like, oh wow, that you know, I can see what If they were able to make more levels transform, it could have potentially been amazing to have that happen to you multiple times as you play this game, but That's really the most exc as exciting as that sort of thing ever gets in this game. So um yeah. Um just uh just wanted to note it there, Matthew. So you're the Mario Music guy, Matthew, and you read this bit of the Awateras, um, and I think you're pretty invested in the uh the works of uh Koshikondo. Um any observations from uh from the m about the music in this game?

Matthew
45:48
That well the serious note is I was quite surprised that There there's almost a nervousness about asking Miyamoto whether they can have another orchestra for the soundtrack. You know, they're like, Oh, should we even ask him? Like is it even worth asking him? He's probably gonna shoot it down, which seems mad to me given how l you know beloved the soundtrack was from the first one. Like that is just as clear a win as Nintendo have had in this generation is that soundtrack. Everyone loves it. It is amazing. So the idea of them thinking, oh I don't know if we can maybe get this over the line, that I thought was a little odd. And maybe speaks to how everyone was thinking about this game from the outset of like, oh if it's just an expansion, maybe we're not gonna be able to to, you know, properly spend on it. Um Uh I mean a lot of the interview is is actually about the physical recording, the fact that they take a lot of the team to watch it just because they think it's important to see. you know, all these musicians doing their thing. Also I think it's just a cool thing that they that they take them along to. And they talk a lot about the conductor having a really great energy really getting into the idea of each track and doing like little dances as he was conducting to try and convey the energy of the track. So they mention him doing sort of like an Arabian Knights belly dance wiggle um when he's doing the desert theme tune, for example, which I like the idea of. I I think that the you know, the message of it all is y you know, there's so much artistry in this game and these musicians are so like in you know, i you know, individually they're all so talented, so to have the sum of all their talents in this soundtrack is really special and isn't that impressive. And also, please buy the soundtrack because we're selling that now. That's the message of it. Rather there being anything particularly you know, groundbreaking about it. Koji Kondo does the Yoshi themes, the Yoshi themes, you know, because he's he's worked on those before. they get a guy from the new Super Mario Bros. Wii team joins as like a co composer, um and he's kinda quite quite excited 'cause he trains doing orchestral composition but doesn't get to express that in new Super Mario Brothers Wii and He has to write the big boss theme to the end of the game and um you know talks about like the pressures of really delivering on that. So It's it's really just uh you know, a load of music nerds talking about writing some really good music.

Samuel
48:16
Yeah, it's uh see what you're saying is me skipping it was probably uh you know, ten minutes saved really. Um Yeah, it's um I did also like the detail about how they got the guy he's like a Nintendo sound guy who did the the um Yoshi Yoshi um noises and to re-record them. And but he hadn't done them for like ten years, so he's worried that his voice would be like a bit deeper or like change with time. That's what Yoshi and Mario Galaxy Two is like

Matthew
48:45
Yo shitty!

Samuel
48:47
There's also a bit of um because like the same guy worked on Animal Crossing, right? And you can kind of see those those strange little Nintendo sounds. They're like um That's definitely part of the the DNA of their games. So it was interesting to r to see there was a link between those those different games and where those sounds come from. Um yeah, so um uh any other observations on the Iwata Ras on the making of this game in general, Matthew, before we get to discussing the game itself?

Matthew
49:11
We've covered the meat of it, to be honest. Um, you know, it it wasn't as deeper dive and they broke less ground. The general takeaway and the general surprise is that something that could have been quite an easy cash grab evolved into something a bit more special, but that involved doing quite a lot of work in quite a short amount of time, you know, which is maybe, you know, what they don't dwell on too much in this interview. You know, they just want to have the positive memories of it rather than Oh fuck, we made a lot of game in not a lot of time. Um which you imagine w is what they're all thinking.

Samuel
49:45
Yeah, I think that so my takeaway was that You know, if you think about Majora's Mask as the model for what they set out to make, Majora's Mask is special because they did something extraordinary with the structure of that game based on the limitations. And this didn't sound like it was going to do anything particularly radical with the the the remix level. So they would have kept, you know, what they were originally working on, the bits and pieces that were meant to be. the original game done again or whatever the whatever the hell they originally set out to make. The fact they didn't do that shows that that was probably gonna be the wrong approach anyway. Um for a for a Mario game. So um that was kind of my takeaway from it is that they started out with, you know, that with Majora's Mask maybe as the model, but they wouldn't have ended up with Majora's Mask the result. Um what they you know what they ended up with was uh you know, uh sort of like uh an evolution of what the first game was in a bunch of different ways, but a bunch of, you know, um sort of well considered ways. So that was my main takeaway really is that Yeah, that was never gonna happen um with this particular type of game. So yes. Should we take a quick break, Matthew, and come back with discussion of what we thought of the game, playing it again? Let's do it. Welcome back to the podcast. So yes, we both played this game over the past week. Uh Batthew, how many times have you played Super Mario Galaxy 2 before? And more or less than the first one?

Matthew
51:33
I think this is the third time I've played it.

Samuel
51:35
Gotcha. Okay. So yeah, first time for me. U Um, where is the Wii at when this game comes along in twenty ten? You know, the original game comes out in oh seven. Like I said, the could have gone either way really, the generation for the Wii. Um but uh you know, what are your memories of covering this game at the time?

Matthew
51:50
2009 had been a bit of a bummer. 2009 was you know that's new Super Mario Bros. Wii, it's Wii Motion Plus, Wii Sports Resorts. It was, you know, all fine, but I wouldn't say we had anything we were, you know, truly, truly in love with. Um, but you do have that great E3 in 2009 where they show off Mario Galaxy 2. they announce um yeah Metroid other M, you know m many other things. So this year's already looking quite healthy. I think two th Twenty ten is is like one of the better Wii years. Um you know, Galaxy Two, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Sin and Punishment Two, Metroid Other M, Kirby's Epic Yarn, in the US, not in the UK that one. You know, it it just felt like all the games which hadn't really manifested all the kind of core stuff, you know, which we hadn't seen a lot of in 2009. you know, that was like an intake of breath before suddenly, you know, here were, you know, a ten, a couple of nines, some eights you know, old stuff which was very aimed at us, you know, third parties were doing okay. I mean th I always think the big indicator of where we were at in two thousand and nine was that was the year um that shitty conduit game came out and got loads of uh press coverage. Because the kind of core was so poorly served by Nintendo, it meant these sort of like snake oil salesman could come along and make you be interested in their shitty first person shooter. The game was so average, but the conversation around it was incredibly depressing to follow and and be part of. So yeah, twenty ten is just like all that's in the past. You just don't have to think about that stuff and You know, I remember Nintendo putting on quite a big press event early in twenty ten to play Galaxy and Other M and but it just felt quite exciting. It felt like they had good games and were throwing their weight around Monster Hunter 3 as well. They kind of backed that in a big way in 2010. So yeah it was uh it was a good year on the mag.

Samuel
53:53
Yeah, I I mean we talked last time about how your first touch point with the original game was, you know, you and the Endgamer team looking at all these videos of people playing the E3 demo and trying to figure out what the game the game's levels will look like based on that. I was curious about what your touch point with this game was.

Matthew
54:11
I i it wasn't quite the same. I I'd say Endgamer by that time W it wasn't like being squeezed, but you were beginning to feel like the slight squeeze of things. And people were beginning to like meddle a little bit more, you know, this is like you've got to have a Pokemon section in the magazine kind of era 'cause we always want Pokemon on the wallet and you know Greener was long gone by then and Uh yeah Nick Ellis was was editing and Gamer and Nick's you know Nick's absolutely great, he's a lovely person, really really like working for him, but You know, the the magazine was sort of slightly different in vibe, you know, it it wasn't going all out. And we also just didn't really have the opportunity to, you know, I don't think uh you know there was like i there wasn't enough run-up to Mario Galaxy 2. Like it was announced and then there was this preview event that we went to so we got to do loads of coverage off the back of that but um it didn't feel like you know we could do like a year of like absolutely rinsing it for for details. So Yeah, it's not quite as special a time, but yeah, it's still exciting to cover.

Samuel
55:19
Yeah, of course. That makes sense. So The critical reception to this game, like this actually you know, Mario Galaxy 2, I know is that it's one of the great Wii games, but it it did sort of pass me by, and you know, as at the time I just wasn't But I was probably paying less attention to the Wii than I was in 2007 for whatever reason. Maybe it's because 2010 was such a monster game for 360 and um I don't know about PS3, but certainly 360. Um had Halo Reach and uh Fable 3 and uh there's Fallout New Vegas. There's like a bunch of stuff that happens that year. Um and so yes, it just wasn't really like on my radar. But it was interesting to look back at the critical reception to this, you know, it did get incredibly you know great scores across the board. Um but I didn't realise difficulty was a bit of a conversation started back then. Um that it was considered harder than the original game. I was wondering what you made of that.

Matthew
56:16
I I I actually I did I should have gone back and reread my review for this 'cause I can't remember what I what I said at the time. Um I don't know if like just my familiarity with Mario Galaxy and having played that a few times and having got my head around it plus the fact that I think they do smooth off some of the rough edges, you know they have made it slightly more accessible in certain ways. Y n I I I don't I don't necessarily feel it. Like I I I I'm often sort of surprised when people talk about this as like the really difficult Mar or like the difficult Mario Galaxy. You know, I I do think the hardest stuff is in Mario Galaxy One. You know, I think getting to 120 stars in this is a lot smoother, a lot more pleasurable. I got to about a hundred and nine stars for this playthrough for this episode. You know, I hadn't hit anything truly nasty on the way, and I that isn't you know, I don't think oh I'm naturally brilliant at these games. I just think it is you know, focus tested it or whatever to get to get rid of those those little sort of snags which could absolutely halt your progress in one and you know, maybe playing a lot of Wii helps, you know, like if you if you only play like one Wii game a year or you haven't played a Wii game since Super Mario Galaxy One and you come to review this, maybe just getting your head around like the Wii Remote and Nunchuck again can throw people off. I don't know, I often didn't feel games were as complicated or fiddly as some of my peers did reviewing them. But then you know, I reviewed these things for a living and I feel like I had a pretty good grasp of how it worked.

Samuel
57:56
Yeah, it feels like this was a different era for how difficulty was discussed because Now games are so focused tested and you know the sort of difficulty can scale. Um, like, you know, you'll play games where different drawers contain ammo because it's scaled to give you ammo at certain points or you know there'll be uh dynamic difficulty settings or just a very wide range of difficulty settings or Different bars and sliders for different mechanics based on your experience. This was an age where I feel like Nintendo just had uh tens of millions of players it never had before on its hands. And it was like, how do we get them to not feel kind of like uh confounded by our games. How do they can they play and enjoy our games? So that's the framework with which I feel like they're discussing difficulty in the Water Ass interviews. And at the same time, you have Xbox and Sony, Iing Nintendo, being like we want a piece of that. And so, you know, uh discussion there becomes about how do we make this accessible to Joe public who don't even like video games and don't even really buy video games but just saw an advert on the telly for this one thing. I think eventually that becomes a bit of a bust. Um the sort of like the way in which they pursue the quote unquote casual audience. When eventually I feel like people just made the same games but then um made their way into them just like um a little bit more flexible so no matter what kind of game it is like you can you can find a way to play it but at the time it was very much concerned with like What if your what if your gran wants to play this game? And it was a much more reductive conversation about difficulty. Um not that we don't have reductive conversations about difficulty now, but Back then it just felt very I don't know. It just f it was a little bit more patronizing, I think, than it is now. Now it's a little bit more like, you know, maybe it's it maybe it's so polished the front end of these games that m maybe it like it lacks a little bit of friction for like all players in in some cases, but back then it was very much like the super guide for the new Super Mario Bros. Wii Wii, what I think was emblematic of how people thought about difficulty at the time. It's like, well we don't want to leave anyone behind, basically. So Yeah, um that kind of came to mind a little bit reading some of these. Um so shall we talk about what holds up well about this game, Matthew? And should I kick us off?

Matthew
01:00:18
Yeah, I'd like to hear your Marriott Galaxy 2 take.

Samuel
01:00:22
Yes, so I think this game doesn't quite reach the heights of the original, which has this Kind of like this the first time we're ever doing this. And you know, the first time we're ever doing this setting, this type of platforming on these spherical worlds. kinda like go for it, bolt out of nowhere feel to it. That this game which is much better behaved overall and way more consistent as a a platforming game from level to level. can't quite match, and I don't ever quite feel like it tries to match it in terms of visually sort of like blowing your mind or showing you something a bit weird or showing you something a bit kind of extraordinary. There's lots of cool stuff that it does and lots of great hooks for levels. I think that the ideas in it are much better sort of like packaged up. And, you know, sort of like con uh contained in the way of like a transformation might just have like one level, it might have three levels, but you'll be guaranteed that, you know, the way it's used in that level is meaningful and and memorable. And sometimes I'd I think maybe like it was what you were saying earlier, in the original Mario Galaxy, maybe sometimes it was a little bit more like one thing could be welded to another to build a level. So I think it loses a little something from that, but In general, it's just uh it's such a slick game. It's so the difficulty for the most part is is much more consistent, I find, than Mario Galaxy. Fewer points where I got stuck. Um however there's just some way in which it doesn't quite set off the pleasure centers of my brain in the same way. And I struggle to quantify what that is because I w looked at all of the l the list of levels today and I went to make my kind of a list of favorite levels and you know I struggled to keep it to a short list. I was like, oh that bit was great. Oh and that bit was really cool. It's really awesome they did that. Look how cool that looks. I found plenty of them, but there's something about how there would just be like one level out of every five in Married Galaxy where you'd be like, wow, I never thought I'd see that in a level, or like, it's really cool that they did that. Part of it, I think, is that the cat the the the colour palette is a little bit a little bit warmer, a little bit closer to what 3D land and 3D world would be. A lot of blue skies like we talked about. There's there is something to be said about how dark spaces as a as a backdrop to Married Galaxy, how and how it gives it that very particular Visual palette. So that's that's where I landed with it. It's like it's it's more consistent. It's probably better objectively, and yet there's something about the original that is superior. What do you think?

Matthew
01:03:11
I think I scored this one point higher than Mario Galaxy 1 when I reviewed it. Right. I I do know what you're talking about. I wonder if Because Mario Galaxy 1 is a little bit more uneven, you know, it has some lower lows. Just having a d a different like tempo, like shifting between levels, means certain levels can stand out more and feel really exceptional and and have that well I truly have I've never seen this before. Also in Mario Galaxy 1 you truly had never seen this before and in Mario Galaxy 2 you've seen Mario Galaxy 1, so they've they're already slightly sort of hindered by that. I think the levels are consistently better I I just think at like minute-to-minute enjoyment. I think Marriott Galaxy 2 is more enjoyable for me than Marriott Galaxy 1.

Samuel
01:04:05
Yeah.

Matthew
01:04:05
But it is a strange continuation and a companion piece. Like I find I find them so hard to separate and this is why I always um and are about it, you know, when we're ranking these things and why we put them together at the top of the Nintendo games and you know, I know some people have an issue with that. They're like, Well it is one or the other and it's like, Well, not really, 'cause I do think you can go from Mario Galaxy One into this and just carry on all the things you've learned and all the skills you've developed and and just sort of, you know, really enjoy how focused the play is. At the same time I do think, you know, with that new structure and the fact that it just serves up level after level after level after level with almost no downtime, it can like wash over you more I wouldn't say the levels are forgettable, but y you forget more of them just because of the pace of the game. I've had this with a few games where Like when I play them I'm like, oh man, I didn't remember half of this, even though it's amazing. Like I th the one always stands out to me is with uh when you compare like Uncharted 2 with Uncharted 3 Uncharted three just ha it has so many great ideas in it and so many great little level concepts, but th they c they come at such a sort of pace that you're like, Oh I forgot you know, you finished the game and you've already forgotten half of it and I can't pin down why that is or what happens there, but s you know, sometimes I think a a better game can be less memorable for its for its weirder pacing. I think that happens with Mary Galaxy 2. Of the 120 stars, I just like a lot more of them than I like the 120 stars in Mario Galaxy. I think the prankster comets in this are much better thought out. Some of them are like shorter, sharper challenges. I don't think there are any any that are too long or too slow. They might be difficult but they're sort of difficult for a shorter amount of time, so it's it's less sort of faff. There's less finding one hundred purple coins, which drove me up the wall in the in the that last stretch of of Mario Galaxy One. Uh uh one thing I will say, playing it now, you know, for the first time in a long time, is I I can see it more as a stepping stone to 3D land and three D world.

Samuel
01:06:16
Yeah.

Matthew
01:06:17
One hundred percent I felt that way watch playing this, yeah. And and and that's always been one of my big criticisms of of World and Land is that you know, after everything that happens in Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, I always felt like they felt a bit bit restrained, a bit too well behaved. And I I was surprised, shocked even, um playing Galaxies in this where I thought, you know, that could be in 3D world and I wouldn't blink. that because they've removed the space from some of the levels and it's just like but like some of the boo levels particularly I thought oh that could just be a boo level. Like in fact I felt like I'd played some of these levels in 3D world Um you know, maybe just like a weird sort of you know trick of the mind there, but uh yeah, that was I mean that was really the most shocking takeaway. It was like, oh actually there is more common ground here than than I thought.

Samuel
01:07:08
Yeah, it's funny that because yeah, definitely you've always positioned these as like the the cosmic-minded wild games, like wild untamed ideas. But this is pretty tamed in terms of the The presentation of a lot of these different ideas. And yeah, so it's I think that that essence is more the original Mario Galaxy than this one. That's a little bit more unknowable, strange, inconsistent, an attempt to do something different. And yeah, this game is um sort of like a just a very well-curated mm Mario experience that uses a bit of sci-fi imagery sometimes as a backdrop and fires you between different worlds to remind you that you are in space. But Generally speaking, the first game does feel like more like it's set in space than this one does. You know? Um yeah. So intra that's that's really interesting because it was gonna be one of my sort of main questions as how whether you saw this as a stepping stone. I think I thought almost right away the first Yoshi level, where the camera is locked behind Mario and it's doing traditional 3D camera stuff, and I was like I don't really there's nothing really cosmic about about this other than like I might get to a ledge and see a a black hole or something where I was just like This is basically, yeah, like a Mario 3D land or three D world level, you know, by by any other name, really. So Interesting that you had that that response to it because yes, I I wondered if you would be if that would be a sensitive issue to bring up.

Matthew
01:09:05
you know, Heyoshida directed 3D land and three D world. You know, it makes sense that it's uh, you know, an an evolution of of that. I mean Yeah, I mean they're basically you know in a way that you know their maps are aren't that different to the map here You know, pretending that these are galaxies or planets, they're just abstract levels and you know this still holds on a tiny bit to the you know, the the framing that you are going on a journey, mainly 'cause you're on a spaceship. But uh yeah, that was uh yeah, that was a bit of an eye opener.

Samuel
01:09:41
Yeah, really interesting. Alright, well let's talk about we've definitely got a lot more to discuss on the things it does well front, but what holds up less well about this game, uh Matthew?

Matthew
01:09:51
I mean this I like genuinely for me there's this n there's not a lot that I that I have a problem with. You know, I'm I am more interested to hear what what didn't hold up well for you. I mean uh Y the thing I had noted for this, you know, was that thing that I can't quite pin down where the the sort of succession of things or you know, not having just a couple of breathers in there means that I think some good ideas get lost in the mix, you know, playing them through this time. There were loads of levels that I thought were brilliant that, you know, I just didn't remember from playing first time round and which would suggest I'll you know they'll probably fade from you know, memory again. But that's this s yeah, like I say, it's this this thing I haven't been quite able to sort of sort of put my finger on it, like why it does that. But that's that's probably my you know, biggest issue with it is that it it just sort of uh charges through things at s at a bit of a relentless pace.

Samuel
01:10:46
Yeah, it's hard to find things that do hold up less well because I think it's an extremely competent platformer. I do think that the the scarring you sometimes get from this game, from the way that the these games build levels, is how the controls will change when you go from one perspective to another. And there's a glitch, I don't know if it's like in it's in the original games, but certainly it's in these ports of Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 where sometimes uh Marius is running in a circle because you try to push one way. into another control scheme when you were he's still stuck in the other one. So he just ends up going in a circle. You have to release the stick and go again. I'd say I died Maybe three times total from that. So it's like a it's a slightly annoying bug I wish they'd found a way to fix, but in general about that being in Original Galaxy. Yeah, but it's definitely in these ports, isn't it? It's definitely there. Yeah. Um yeah, so uh yeah, so like there's um there's a few difficulty spikes in this. It's like one bit The the thing I got most stuck on in this was there is uh a level where you're going through a little boo mansion bit with a slightly odd top-down camera And then you go outside at some point, you jump into one of those little star things, get fired out, and then you're like on this like purple this purple liquid river basically. These little pink platforms kind of like roll out bit by bit. And there is a hidden star, um, in that level where you have to as mentioned, this is the inception style a wall of the like purple liquid will like fold up and then another wall will fold up and it's like at first you're like wow that is like really mind-bending stuff And it's actually just incredibly annoying because the controls change each time he goes up a different angle. So like what is up and down changes twice in about the space of about 30 seconds. And then like the last dash to get that star with all these like ghost motherfuckers trying to knock you off is like uh just a lot of swearing on my part. Um so every now and then there'll just be something where I'm like, oh the spherical levels of this means they've had to compromise the the playability of it a tiny bit because it just has to the perspective has to change in order to support the gameplay experience that they've built. Doesn't happen very often though. Um rarely happens in fact. But wants to note that. Yeah.

Matthew
01:13:08
But my m that boo level's interesting 'cause on that stretch before it gets too spicy, there's quite an easy opportunity to win three one up mushrooms. There's like a music note thing, which I think is them sort of like ex you know, realizing oh a lot of people are gonna die on this bit. So let's give them an easy way. And you end up doing it so often to get three mushrooms every time that you leave that level with like fifty one ups. Th I mean no kidding. I had fifty-two lives to get through the rest of the game.

Samuel
01:13:45
Yeah, that I can see I can see why that'd be the case. There's not loads L Sud level at it. I do think that the it is so stripped back as an like you say, the i the lack of in-between to the levels. made me realize why Astrobot does have the bits where you wander around those landscapes or put the extra bit of the PlayStation in or d do the little sort of like which character's gonna come out of the you know the uh sort of gacha machine thing. It's because like you say, if you have that breather you can better program what it better sort of like reflect on what you just played and where you're at in the game and like and sort of like create a little m you know mini sort of like postmarkers in your head of where you've been. I'd say it's a very apt analogy that the um the Rosalina bullshit is consigned to a book that sat on a chair and in the basement of w where you keep your powers um underneath the like Mario head in this game. That's new for the Switch version. Oh really? Oh okay I didn't know that. I mean I pretty sure I don't remember that book there being there in the original I'd say the lack of Rosalina in general in this game is such a like a symbol of what they wanted to do with the Mario Galaxy story in the first game that just is not In the mix at all in this one. It's just that tubby purple lad with his little pyjama pants on. Lubba. Yeah, lover. I wonder where they got that name from. I wonder what the um portmanteau there is uh that came up with that. Um so it's so stripped back that it's almost like it's a slight bummer. It's almost like them def admitting defeat to have so little there. And yeah, but it does mean that the experience of going from level to level is very slick. However, my hottest take on what doesn't work well about this game, Matthew. Here we go. There's not a single good boss bad in this game. They're all shit. Oh no. They're all shit.

Matthew
01:15:35
Oh strong disagree.

Samuel
01:15:37
Okay, fine. The best one is firing those balls at Bowser which you do three times in identical fashion. summons up these little asteroids, you jump on them, jump down them, fire at them at him, you've got to direct them properly. That is like, I will say that's fine. And then there's like A terrible Bowser Jr. one where you gotta fire these um what have you got f you gotta fire something out as little uh as big robots Blue tits and then a tit on his back as well.

Matthew
01:16:03
Oh the bullet bit the bullet bit is what it's mega hammer. It's kinda hammered.

Samuel
01:16:07
Shite that's terrible. That fucking giant snake that obscures the camera and so you can't see where the fuck anything is.

Matthew
01:16:15
That giant snake. That's So uh uh is it Gobbleguts the dragon? Uh uh That thing is that's the 3D version, I think, of that horrible snake from Link's Awakening.

Samuel
01:16:27
Oh yeah, I could see that.

Matthew
01:16:28
The only real AI similar chaotic you have no idea where it's gonna go, energy. It's quite frightening to deal with.

Samuel
01:16:34
Is this does this go in your this is the only true AI kinda like take?

Matthew
01:16:39
I think there is I think there's like a a wild unpredictability to gobble guts that doesn't exist in any other Mario boss.

Samuel
01:16:47
But I think you just I think you just brute force your way through that boss. I don't think it's even vaguely elegant. It's a messy bit of boss design. And so those are basically the bosses I think.

Matthew
01:16:57
And I can't say the There's that there's that octopus in the chariot.

Samuel
01:17:01
Uh

Matthew
01:17:02
Yes, that's actually that's fine. That's fine. Bat the melons back at the end.

Samuel
01:17:07
Yeah, I did that's quite fun. I did that first time. That's alright actually, I'll give you that one. Yeah, we go. But those other ones Tell me they're not ass. They are ass. Like the Bowser one's okay. But those other two rubbish. That snake crap. Like that's That's the strongest I felt about the game. There's no other part of the game where I'd be like, that's outright bad. But considering the imagination of the rest of the game, those bosses are very, very lukewarm.

Matthew
01:17:29
I l I don't know. I I don't actually see them being that different from the bosses in like Odyssey or 3D what I don't I I think they're all of a similar th I think they they their bosses have a particular flavor at EAD Tokyo. Right. And it's a flavor I quite like. I like the the the three hits. I think they feel quite nice, they react nice. I I I just I really don't have a problem with them.

Samuel
01:17:52
I like that the snakes make steam train sounds. I enjoy that, but Yeah. I think there's just a lack of readability to that snake one that really got my back up when I was playing the second version of it that you do in the battle uh thingy bajig planet um battle uh galaxy uh last night where I was just like I can't see where the fuck Mario is. Um that head's just I can't work out how to even avoid that head while I'm trying to like kill this motherfucker. And it's like they give you the extra um three life pieces because I think they know again that it's not very elegantly done, so you just gotta smash your way through it, you know.

Matthew
01:18:27
I'm not I'm not gonna quibble if you know, you clearly had a bad time with it, you had a bad time with it. Um That would that would suggest there's something up with it. Uh you know, um I that's that's fine. I'm not gonna say they're like you know, all timers or anything, but I I certainly don't hate them. Well I like the one where you um use the clouds to climb up and bop Bowser and his Bowser Jr. on his own. I like that one as well. Yeah, that's good.

Samuel
01:18:51
When it turns into the tank, that's got big metal gear energy. Yeah, that is good actually. But that is partly tied to how good the cloud powers are, but we'll come back that.

Matthew
01:19:00
Oh yeah. But using the cloud powers to take down basically the Mario Galaxy Shagger Hodgka. Yeah. There's one I really, really hate and I can understand where your hatred for the bosses comes from because w when you hit them and they can be very frustrating. I I really hate Squizzard in the sand level. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. Which is the one you have to throw like six fireballs into its mouth while it's chucking shit at you and quicksand is pulling you down towards the mouth. I mainly hate that one because it's like the big showcase for Fireflower which as established in the previous episode is ass in Marigates.

Samuel
01:19:43
It didn't change the music either. Still the same fucking music, man. That that really sucks. So I like They're just none of them are amazing, you know? It's sort of like But You're a hard man to please, Samuel Roll. Well no, but I I I think, right, even though they're not it's not like incredible I do think there was something really satisfying in the original Mario Galaxy where you would have Bowser dive-bomb into those lava things and then He would spin round the planet and you would have to like counter where he was spinning from. Yeah. And that just made you think about the setting in a way that felt very particular. to like the style of level they built where I was like, well, even though it's as simple as the ones here, like it is like the three hits kind of thing. That it's at least like it fits what Galaxy is so well, you know?

Matthew
01:20:30
Yeah. Yeah. The the the idea of Bowser's running that way, so I'll I'll like reverse the orbit and run the other way to meet him halfway is is just like a a genius little revelation in that game for sure. That's that's that's okay. Listen, we're not I'm not gonna go to like war over the bosses in Mario Galaxy 2. Did you like uh well no uh I mean well you probably didn't based on what you've said What about the the final Bowser fight? Because you obviously you do it on the planet and then they have like the fake out and then you have the sort of cinematic takedown, which I think is something. they obviously got a taste for because I think their their final boss fights in their games get more and more extravagant, like all you know, leading up to Donkey Kong Bonanza, which has you know, a really like wildly ambitious ending to it I'd say. Like they've obviously got a taste for these like cinematic or one more thing moments.

Samuel
01:21:22
I mean it is God in space, right? Really? It's it's that's why I imagine you like it Yeah, I I like it as a punctuation. I think it needed something extra, and I expected something extra because otherwise it is just the same thing you've already done before. Um so yeah, I I like that. I mean I will admit to Not totally being able to grasp where the the balls were firing off to and when it w when Bowser was in the distance, but it's not really a serious bit of like gameplay design. It's a very straightforward, you know, just spam him three times and then you're done kind of thing.

Matthew
01:21:52
Um if it was truly God in space, Mario would have possessed a bullet bill and like flown it into Bowser's heart like Ben to still

Samuel
01:22:00
Yeah, that's that that is true. I think in general though, like my my sort of feeling with this game was like it is like it is brilliant on the whole. It's so polished compared to the first one. It's so much more consistent. But it it's like it I again goes back to the thing I said about the camera where there's just a little something of the identity of the first game that Gives it that edge as an experience to me, even if I objectively this is a better game. Um so yeah, it's just there's a very it's just a very particular strain of something. That is hard to define and I realize that's not particularly useful for you the listener and for me to say that. But I think if you play these games back to back, you do understand that there is a difference between them, you know?

Matthew
01:22:40
Uh I I I think people have been wrestling with this between Mario Galaxy one and two, you know, since they came out, you know, the the constant flip-flopping, the arguments between which one is, you know You know, Mario Galaxy 1 is definitely the more important game, you know, in terms of actually like doing all that legwork. But you know, is Mario Galaxy 2 the more entertaining game? But you know Uh yeah, it's it's it's it's tough. It was har it was you know, I haven't gone back to that original review, but I remember struggling a little bit to to work out exactly sort of how to explain how how I felt about it. Yeah. Um which is why I have cowardly grouped them together because I'm like, well, you know Why why you know, why does it have to be one over the other? I mean it's quite an interesting pairing in that one doesn't cancel out the other in any way.

Samuel
01:23:31
No, it is sort of like in some ways I think that it feels this game does also feel like a a very, very deluxe level pack for the first game. Like it's it does have brand new mechanics, but it is like, you know, the I I think in some ways The first game's so good at showing you the full potential of what they can do visually and in terms of set pieces that it means this game does have its work cut out for it to show you something new and extraordinary you've never seen before because They already reached so far with that first game. So yeah, um I definitely don't hold it against it that it can't necessarily conjure that first encounter with Mario Galaxy and the feeling that gives you. Because like we say, it's um it's a more refined um platforming game and the way the ideas are packaged up is just, you know, it's Chef Kiss really. And I like I like that levels are a lot shorter in a lot of cases.

Matthew
01:24:23
Um so Matthew, I didn't want to It's a bit like how it is with astronauts. Everyone remembers the first astronauts and they seem super impressive. But like after a while you're just like, yeah, I guess there's some people up there. Um so let's talk about our fate That irritating one with the guitar. Remember him? Uh no, I remember he was like the one he was he just kept playing like his guitar. He was like the cool astronaut. He was up in space, I don't know, maybe like ten years ago.

Samuel
01:24:50
pop up in Apple TVs for all mankind because that would be is he Chris Hadfield?

Matthew
01:24:55
Is that the guitar one?

Samuel
01:24:56
Oh right, okay. Yeah. Oh oh I think I vaguely mean I know who you mean, yes.

Matthew
01:25:02
Who's the uh They're not making first man about you know they made first man, they're not making twenty third man, you know?

Samuel
01:25:10
First man too and Lubberz in it. You know he's there in na working in NASA helping the ship get going. Okay Matthew, favorite galaxies in this game? Um you kick us off. Oh I I did have a point about the end game actually. Oh yeah, sorry, I skipped that because we already talked about you liking the end game more than the first game and I thought that kind of addressed it. But if you've got anything more to add, go for it.

Matthew
01:25:30
What the the only thing I wanted to find out, which is annoying in that it only unlocks at 120 stars. Do you know about the green stars? No, not really. When you get a hundred and twenty stars, it then hides a hundred and twenty green stars in all the previous levels. Okay. I actually think that's the That's that level of like secrets and like weird stuff around the edges. But it only appears right at the end and it's like a sec in i I wanna say it's a second game, like it's not for everyone. I'd I'd never got all a hundred and t two hundred and forty. stars in this, but they ask you to like break out the bounds of the level and particularly to use like Cloud Mario to get to some really fucking weird places and you'll go into levels and you'll see a green star on a bit of like the background where you're like, I didn't even know I could get there and then you're expected to sort of break out of the linear root of the level somehow. It's not for everyone. I know some people find it really boring or frustrating, but I do think It's way more interesting and appealing than Do It All Again as Luigi, which is kind of the pitch in in Mario Galaxy One. Yeah. It just requires you to get to that 120 stars to begin with, which, you know, i You know, it's a bit of an ask.

Samuel
01:26:46
Yeah, I mean what is the um is this like a step towards the star coins in 3D land and 3D world? Is that them sussing that Oh actually, it it it deepens your relationship with the level to think about this other thing you gotta go find.

Matthew
01:27:01
It is, but I mean honestly, they're they're more it it's more like What weird places did game testers get to? And let's put a star there just to show that you can. Oh, that's cool. It's stuff you didn't think actually was level, kind of is level. Yeah. And you just have to take some like crazy long jumps in like quite weird places to get there.

Samuel
01:27:22
Yeah, they talked at the Iwata Ross about the idea that the cloud powers meant that people could break the levels and get to places they didn't want them to. I like the idea they reverse engineered that back into game mechanics. That's cool.

Matthew
01:27:33
Yeah, they do. I will say it's not for everyone. I wouldn't say oh this is the bear game 'cause it's got, you know, another hundred and twenty stars, but I I do like that there is something quite gnarly and weird and difficult right at the end of this game, if you get that.

Samuel
01:27:47
Yeah, I will admit to skipping every single Prankster star and all that stuff because Oh, they're so much better in this. Well that's the thing, I had such a bad experience in the first game. I just thought fuck them. I'll just try and get to the uh get through as much as I can. However I'm tantalized by what the map screen shows me for the S world at the end and I'm a bit like, it wouldn't be it would be nice to see all of those levels. They do look pretty cool, so Yeah, I might um I might change my mind on that one, Matthew. Um yeah, so Best Galaxy Zen. I'd love to I'm sure there won't be a shortage here. You kick off with some of yours, because I I listed loads last time. Alright, so um I want to this is a weird one to start with, but the first Chompworks Galaxy level with the Rube Goldberg machine um making the There's not like many of these puzzles, but you just have to make these big um, you know, uh sort of like yeah, chain chomp heads move down these like little kind of like rails and hit their end goal and in order to progress the level and it might involve like uh a a bit of track is like suspended up on a platform so you have to bounce the platform down so it forms a flat track or or that sort of thing. And I just thought that was a really great, kind of like neat one off idea. You never see that idea again. Um but and it's a brief level, but I was like, that's cool.

Matthew
01:29:01
I uh the good thing about Chomp Works is that Mario is basically enabling the production of things which are gonna kill him in other levels. That is It's like no Mario, you should be sh shutting this place down.

Samuel
01:29:13
You should be fucking it up. Um I will save the uh second Chompworks galaxy level. for the um the the next section of this podcast Matthew um um f I I I gotta say the Flash Black Galaxy I'll fucking love that shit where Basically, there's a flash of lightning lightning every few seconds, and you have to use that to navigate the entire map. That's a sort of like one-off idea, I'm like. That rules. I absolutely love that. Um I I really liked um Flipsville Galaxy, but especially the second one. Um so this one is basically like On the it's like the the same it's like a different level on the bottom of the level and then it it becomes an upside-down level. And it just you're just going back and forth between this bottom layer that's facing down and top layer that's facing up. Um for in the first level you're bouncing through these grates to do it. But in the second level it gives you the drill power, which spoiler it I fucking love the drill in this game. Um and the second level is like a dirty version of the first one, um, but then uses a drill in some interesting ways. Um so I really like that one. Um and I really um I thought that Slip Sand Galaxy was pretty cool because it was visually cool that it orbits this like massive pyramid that I don't think you ever get to go inside. Which I thought I thought surely that I wanna drill through that motherfucker. There's like a pyramid floating in space like a fucking prog rock cover or something of an album or Or whatever.

Matthew
01:30:43
I like you get one power up and you just become like maniac fracking marriage.

Samuel
01:30:48
But I just love any kind of terrain deformation in games. It's just always a mechanic I really dig. Um so that's really cool. 'Cause I feel like it builds the whole level around tantalizing you that you might get to go to this pyramid, but then does something really cool when even when you can't, and you end up slipping down this vast thing of sand and you know, dodging these obstacles coming down and just I think that has a bit more of the visual flavor of um the original Mario Galaxy that I felt like the game was lacking a little bit. Like that is a game that is uh that's an unashamedly sci-fi level that one. Um and I didn't note the level here, but I really like the one. It ends with like this big 3x3 grid. It's like a 2D level. Where the directions are shifting every few seconds and you have to collect the bits of stars. And it's like the end of a level. But in general, I was pretty impressed by how this game uses 2D. And this was like You basically have to make sure that you tumble into the right square that you want to be in and then think ahead on your positioning. And these are all mechanics that are in the the first Mario Galaxy, but just here it feels like a lot of those mechanics are taken to their natural conclusion. Um and so that's really really good. I didn't note the level, but there's one level where you can use a drill to go through um this big stone. and um knock these like hit these giant um these little turtles from the bottom and kill them by doing that and you do that three times in this big um stone that's cool And in a similar note, I do like the level where all the enemies are giant, Matthew. It's a really obvious one to pick. Supermassive. Super massive. I mean, I just like, again, just You know, we're only gonna do it like once or twice and you know, all the enemies will be big, and then we'll kind of leave you to get on with your day. Like it's

Matthew
01:32:34
The economy of Because the assets look great.

Samuel
01:32:37
They do.

Matthew
01:32:37
The the Wamps look so good, massive.

Samuel
01:32:40
Yeah, they really do. And so uh yeah, it's Uh in general it is a slightly nicer looking game than the first one, um, in a f in a few different ways, but yeah, that's one level that sort of shows it really, really well. Um those are just some that come to mind Matthew, but as I was scrolling through the list of galaxies, I honestly found about like last time, just about twenty that I thought were really, really good. So why don't you pick up from there?

Matthew
01:33:00
So I really like Cloudy Court, which is I'd say the second big showcase for Cloud Marrow in this is the one where you have to there's lots of like fans pushing clouds around. So the thing the idea of Cloud Marrow is is you basically have to sort of finish the level using him. You know, there's lots of missing platforms so you have to know when to make them and it it it never really gets pushed that hard early on in the game. Um so it's it's quite an easy level, but I do like the idea of you know, having control over where the platforms appear. Uh also I just the the the Cloudy Core and is it Fluffy Buff, I think is the first one. Uh they have a great bit of music. It's very Gusty God and coded. Yeah, that that one's amazing. How did you feel about Throwback Galaxy?

Samuel
01:33:48
Ugh So I was I was tempted to mention it. I actually do like the sort of almost like pared down geometry of it that it is it's just really it's really straightforward the uh the dry the sort of like washed out colour palette of N64 era Mario is like visually striking where you've got all these like newer assets on top of it. It's alright is where I fell on it really.

Matthew
01:34:16
Okay. Yeah. Oh I mean, I remember at the time, you know, playing this for review, you know, when you don't know any of this stuff's coming. Like then seeing the name of it and seeing like the icon for it and thinking, oh wait, surely they're not gonna do that and then landing on it and that music kicking in and I was like You know. Oh well, we're in ed this is an edge ten, obviously. You know? Well I didn't give it, I didn't review it for edge, I should say. But like that that was you know, in the way that um boy bass in the first one was where I was like, yeah, absolutely, you know, this is this is this is the hottest shit ever. Um th I throwback was for f was for me a huge nostalgic play, obviously. Um it is You know, it isn't like one to one with the the Mario 64 level and I I kind of get that, but I I love what a showcase it is for just how versatile and easy it is to to control Mario in Galaxy. Like throwing him around that level in a way that you could never throw Mario around. um Wombs Fortress like that in in the f in Mario sixty four. Well I certainly couldn't anyway. Uh yeah. You know, it was just like This guy's unstoppable, but I you know, it isn't one-to-one, so it's not quite a f a fair comparison.

Samuel
01:35:37
Well, I mean if anything, it's a lot of restraint to only have one level that really does that. I mean of all the different ideas that pop up in this. I would also say I slightly preferred the second uh version of it where you could um use the cloud powers to kind of get around it. That's yeah that's actually a really cool collision of that Original idea with with the new powers, you know?

Matthew
01:35:59
There was a there was a time where all I wanted with them was to remake Mario 64 in this star, and I don't actually know if that's particularly right or a good take. Um Uh Shiver Burn, which is the one which has lots of ice and lots of fire. I think uh a thing this game understands is that Uh Ice Mario is shit, he's not in it, but it does give you a lot of ice to skate on because they know that that feels amazing and you don't need to be Ice Mario for that to happen. So when you're skating on ice and there's like lava pools and you're sliding around them or jumping over laser fire I that that stuff is that just makes me so happy. Um that's that's amazing movement. Um I really like Cosmic Cove. Which is the one which is a water level which you can turn into an ice level. Again, one of those switch levels.

Samuel
01:36:49
I love that level as well. That's really good. Yeah.

Matthew
01:36:51
Yeah, that's that's really good. It's got these when when the water isn't ice, it's got these warp stars just under the surface and when you fire out of them, it shoots you really far above the planet. just up into like a ring of star bits and it's you can't move when you're up there. It's like a canned animation. But i I love the height Mario gets. That's a real like, oh yeah, he's so far away from this place. That that that's always Magic when that happens. A kind of Mario level which I I I do like is uh a tall trunk, which is the big shoot. I'm afraid that's on my worst levels when Mario. Oh no! I was gonna say what I like about that is cause It always makes me think of Dave Perry fucking it up on Gamesmaster when he slipped off the side and then threw a huge wobbly. And yeah, I've just got a inbuilt fondness of those sliding levels because of that moment. It is a pain in the arse, but I do quite like it when you when you pull it off.

Samuel
01:37:54
I think the physics of those slide levels are fucked. Like he just goes careening off in a way where I'm like That's that makes no sense that he's even doing that. And there's no c there's no control.

Matthew
01:38:04
When he like leaves the ground I I mean there's enough control that that my ham fisted fingers could do.

Samuel
01:38:10
Well, I finished all the levels. It's just that it's I was just like Well this is bad. Like this is just like stay on because I know I mean I understand how Dave Perry feels because I definitely had my fair share of tantrums specifically on Tool Trunk Galaxy But it was like any time I was stuck on a linear tube going really fast, I was like, there's a th this could go wrong. And like as soon as it goes wrong a little bit, it's completely fucked, basically.

Matthew
01:38:35
I'm so glad you didn't do the Prankster version of this where you have to get a hundred purple coins.

Samuel
01:38:40
Oh my god, you are joking. Is that really a thing you do in this? Yeah. What the f So you've got to have You've got to have a perfect route down to get them. Absolutely. I mean then I'm not I'm simply not going to see the all the levels in this game, unfortunately. That's never gonna happen. I hate oh man, any time it was like this Mario's got too much momentum in this where you are like You can affect the outcome, but it doesn't feel like you've got precise one-to-one control. I'm like, this sucks. So that definitely gets my least favorite. Any others for f favourite?

Matthew
01:39:11
Well I'd s I'd say as a rule, any level in this where you have to very carefully travel down something, there is a version where you have to do it again with purple coins.

Samuel
01:39:19
I mean yeah, I I I I stick that that bird motherfucker in this as well, who you control with motion controls. Um Yeah, in general I um I didn't even uh which I didn't even enjoy as much as the guide the ball over the laughter, which they didn't even dare to repeat, the the cylinder of death from Mario Galaxy 1 Matthew. They never do anything like that here, but anyway, please carry on with your favourite levels.

Matthew
01:39:41
I quite like Star Sh Starshine Beach, which is the Mario Sunshine throwback with the Pin pinyar pin not pinyaters, pintas what they called. Pin uh pin up Piantas.

Samuel
01:39:54
Piantas, that's it, yeah.

Matthew
01:39:55
Yeah. Um I mainly like it 'cause the one of the stars there is uh Yoshi eating the red chilies to run really fast. It's actually it's a prankster one I think Because you have to collect the purple coins running across the water as Yoshi, but the purple coins are like presented in this really nice arc and I don't know, just Something running so fast that it goes across the surface of water, you know, that's cool in Incredibles. That's cool in Mario Galaxy 2.

Samuel
01:40:21
This is actually I wouldn't call this my least favorite, but this is like the most d one of the most disappointing ones for me. Because I think it looks amazing and when you are up in the Dome of Water at the start looking down at it, which I put a screenshot of this on social media, it looks fantastic. But I don't think anything you do in any of these levels is that interesting. They're all pretty like, yeah, go over here, then go up here. It's like there's no I feel like that this is this game's version of um Seaslide Galaxy in Mario Galaxy 1, where it's like a visual departure. It's a little bit of a holiday from the rest of the game. But I like that the that Seaslide Galaxy kind of focused on racing and momentum around that big track. And this is just sort of like some islands, you know?

Matthew
01:41:05
But uh th that that is why I Would say particularly that star with Yoshi and the chili pepper, just because it it gives it a bit of focus. You're right. I think they they actually struggle when they have a landmass which is too big. Yeah. They never really know what to do with it other than putting a load of silver stars for you to find in in like five places. Like they obviously get in touch with that. you know, side of themselves again by the time they get to Odyssey, but they become so good at these, you know, 3D obstacle course levels that anything where there is a bit of like Take your time and explore. They can go wrong if any levels go wrong.

Samuel
01:41:43
Yeah, yeah.

Matthew
01:41:44
Yeah, I had slip sand here, which obviously we talked about. I quite like puzzle plank, which is the wooden one which sores itself apart as you go along it.

Samuel
01:41:52
Oh that is awesome actually, yeah. That's really good. That's like that's got I Yeah. A great example of a level that's been deleted by my memory because they they happen in quick succession in this game.

Matthew
01:42:01
Yeah, that yeah, that's that's that's one of those. Um and you know, I talked about them in the first episode, but Uh there's another sort of flip switch type galaxy in this where where where the level changes when you flip. Um there's also one where the the level where the platforms change on the beat, beat block. Uh I really like that. Uh what you might never see, 'cause it's I think the second to last level in the S world, is there's uh a level where Every time you spin, like the le like blue and red blocks come out of the back of a wall. And it so you have to and a lot of it involves like wall jumping while Pulling walls in and out so that there's walls for you to jump off of. It's a lovely bit of platforming, but I think if If you're not feeling all of the galaxy moveset by then, it's probably like game over and end of game for a lot of people.

Samuel
01:42:59
Oh, is it you have to do the specific kind of jumps and all that kind of stuff.

Matthew
01:43:03
It's just a very demanding specific bit of platforming, which is actually a mode I I really like in in Maria Galaxy. But um the beatblock one, that's got a prankster comet that Does it at twice the speed. Now that is a motherfucker. Because they're there for like a split second. So you always have to like you have to basically jump into the hole and the hole will become a platform by the time you land. And like having the nerve to just jump into the holes over and over again, I think that that asks something uh quite special of you.

Samuel
01:43:33
I think speaking of levels where you kinda like cackle because you think you devilish motherfuckers, um like the first um World S level, Mario Squared Galaxy Where it's just a big thing of like those disappearing platforms and those switches you have to activate. Did that last night and I thought, you know what, it's really cool that they did that and that's the first like special world that you do um after the game's done. Um that's really good. So I I like that too, Matthew. Anymore? That level has a prankster variation where the Shadow Marios are chasing you. Yeah, I like how every time you say there's a prankster Mario, it's then you you basically then say where a man comes into your living room and kicks you in the balls and then says, Now now do it But I what what I like about the Shadow Mario is that

Matthew
01:44:17
I think it's way more interesting than just putting a time limit on a level. Yeah. Like the idea that if you ever stop this thing's gonna hurt you 'cause it's following in your footsteps. It just puts this pressure to always be moving, which I think's a much more interesting dilemma than you know, do it efficiently.

Samuel
01:44:33
Yeah, that's fair enough.

Matthew
01:44:35
Um well any any other galaxies Matthew before we move into least favorites.

Samuel
01:44:39
Which I don't have many. Yeah I don't have many either. Um So, uh we mentioned Tool Trunk Galaxy. Um Yeah, that's okay.

Matthew
01:44:48
I like I I get it.

Samuel
01:44:49
I can understand why that would be. I just think it's a game of all about like precision. It just doesn't have it, I don't think. Like it's As soon as you like I say, as soon as something goes wrong, he just goes flying off, he just goes careening off, and it's just like absolute chaos. Um so I thought I really hated um Clockwork's Ruin um Galaxy Clockwork Ruins Galaxy because it's got that really annoying so you have to like This whole fucking slow bit where you're going up this hill, hiding in these gaps in these cogs that are roll these giant cogs that are rolling down. And then you have to like Uh basically to get to the end of the the level, you have to like balance on top of these um again big uh cogs that move very, very slowly to get to the star. And if you fuck that up and then go like flying down the hill, which spoiler alert I did. The checkpointing is not at all generous. You're climbing that thing again, you're waiting again for these really slow-moving, boring cogs to kind of come down this hill. And And it's just so that combined with the earlier part where you have to Try and collect coins around these like big rotating sort of like well I guess like clockwork is the the clue the clue here um big rotating platforms basically. And then sort of like to to progress. That's there's nothing strictly wrong with that. However There is an optional planet you can unlock that requires you to collect coins in the early part of that level to give to one of those Luma motherfuckers. Are the Lumas actually? I don't know. The little tubby guys.

Matthew
01:46:25
Yeah, I think it's a variation of the hungry luma.

Samuel
01:46:28
Indeed. Um, and in order to like um create a bit of the level, and that makes you think about Where all the different gold coins are placed. I will say in general this is something I thought was a little bit lacked creativity about the game, is it all gate things based on collectibles. within a given level and all it really makes you do is think about the level in terms of where things are placed. And I don't think it makes me admire the level design. It just feels like an arbitrary blocker to me. And I particularly felt that in this level, as I was very methodically spinning around this one thing trying to get like one coin in order to like get up to 30 to give to this little motherfucker. And that still was only one of the two times I'd have to go through that level in order to finish it. I hate clockwork ruins left for galaxy.

Matthew
01:47:11
Uh so two things here. One, how would you feel if I told you At some point those cogs are gonna have a hundred purple coins on them. I would say So that's uh that's point number one point number two in that Awata asks the bit with the giant wheels rolling down the hill that you hate so much is one of the bits Heyashida credits one of the non-designers coming up with on the team and making in the level design and stuff. Where well um It's like, and this is good because someone came up with this idea and then we polished it up where actually you're like, nah that sucks and you shouldn't have been allowed to come near this game. Well no, I don't think there's I don't know if that was someone in accounts who came up with that. Oh well I mean that's exactly the kind of torturous.

Samuel
01:47:58
That's that's who you're stomping on. That's well, I'd expect someone in payroll to come up with some torturous nonsense, to be honest, so that sort of tracks to me. Uh even if even if it's not correct. Um it's like, yeah, we think we're gonna make you wait and it's gonna be really unsatisfying. I could see someone in payroll coming up with that. Um yeah Uh yeah, I so I hate that level. I think that's like that's that's rubbish. Uh I didn't enjoy any part of that other than the initial first impression of ooh it's a bit Indiana Jones-ish, I'm in some ruins or whatever. Um okay. I don't have that many. I mean this is probably a good time to say the ones um Spring Mario level, the sep second Chompworks galaxy level. Um is ass. You fucking wimp. No, it's rubbish. They know Spring Mario's crap. That's why he's isolated to a single level. And you know, every other transformation in this game, I think all the new ones are fucking great. Like the you know the the I think the Rock Mario one works really well when they build a whole level out of tunneling you down Um some nonsense later on. That's a little bit more like I think that's one of the melty thingy bejig galaxies. Where you have to bounce off That's shite. Um, because again, one once it once again, the tiniest mistake and you'll go careening off into the abyss.

Matthew
01:49:15
I like

Samuel
01:49:20
Um z but but that's because the rest of the game doesn't punish mistakes quite so readily. But in all of those momentum based You know, you gotta do this, like you've gotta go straight forward, you moving very quickly. It's got a very particular control scheme that you don't have in the rest of the game. The stakes are just raised so much. And it's just and it's just incredibly irritating to go through. And once once again, that fucking um the the one we're talking about, the rock Mario, where the rock is acting like a pinball. That level's got a fucking life built into it because they know you're gonna die loads, so they give you an opportunity to get a life every time you go through it. Because they know it's bad, Matthew. Because they know it's bad.

Matthew
01:50:01
They don't know it no, they they just know that people uh kinda cack-handed. What I love about that level is it ends with the star is in a pen that's lined with elastic walls. and you have to bounce off an elastic wall and jump to get the star. But because every wall is an elastic wall and you're firing all over the place, it's very easy to make it to that pen and then just fling yourself into space and lose. It's It's one of the more malicious bits in the game, but it it made me laugh to see it. I was like, I see what you're doing. Yeah, that's fine. I think Koizumi says he was responsible for Goron Link in Majora's Mars, which obviously has a similar kind of like rolling boulder feel to it. which meant that he kind of policed Boulder Mario quite carefully and really wanted them to like nail it like, I've got good form, I know what a Boulder man feels like, so um let's make sure we get it right.

Samuel
01:51:01
Yeah, yeah. I s You know what the aside from I mean that one that level by the way is called a stroll down rolling lane the what I was complaining about. And the worst thing about it is that You At the very end, the camera pulls further out and it completely changes the feel of the game because you suddenly have to instead of going straight forward You need to bounce off of one wall, bounce off of another, and then sort of like boying into a ring um to get the to get the start. And like it's like There's the first time you reach that bit where the camera pulls out. It's a bit like that really is the like We've we've sent a guy around your house. Because it's a proper like, okay, now we're gonna ask you, now you're at the end of this level, we're gonna ask you to rethink about this level on the fly. Um when you're moving so quickly you can't even you have no time to really react to anything. And then you immediately fuck it up. Then you fuck it up eight more times and then it's over and you're like, I'm never coming back to this. This is where you tell me there's a Prankster star where it's like you have to bounce and get a hundred coins in like one go or something.

Matthew
01:52:14
I don't think there's anything too nightmarish with Prankster and um uh Bowl Demarrow.

Samuel
01:52:20
Did you do any of the chimp challenges?

Matthew
01:52:23
Huh.

Samuel
01:52:23
I was about to ask about this. I did I think three of them in the end. Um Yeah. Yeah, I did including the bowling one, which is probably the most notable one, isn't it?

Matthew
01:52:32
Yeah, the bowling one is That's not bad. You just have to hit a load of strikes with Boulder Mario, that's fine. I was curious if you ever tried the ones where you have to Kill enemies to get points to hit his point total.

Samuel
01:52:45
The ice skating one.

Matthew
01:52:46
Uh there isn't uh no, so there's an ice skating one. There's there's one on foot as well. I think it only happens twice. They are quite difficult because they hinge on there being a point multiplier when you jump from head to head, so you have to chain all these jump kills together.

Samuel
01:53:03
Oh god. No, I didn't I didn't do that.

Matthew
01:53:05
Oh yeah. I'm glad you didn't play those because I think you would have you would have not liked them. Particularly the fact that like I think the chimp is meant to be like a send-up of like a pro gamer, so he's kind of making fun of you for not being like elite enough and all this, and I think that would have really got under your skin.

Samuel
01:53:22
In general, I was sort of like, once again, I disapprove of um the fucking post toad in this game. Because I mean sometimes he'll just give you like one single life and a letter from Peach and I'm like, what's the fucking point, my man? And then Occasionally you'll get a letter going, Oh, I've got a new challenge for you. Kindest regards the chimp, and you're like, fuck, I cannot cannot believe I'm getting post on this fucking monkey And this little toad has stopped to explain it. Again, he's got way too much staff, Mario. He should fire at least half the toads. Most of them as pointed out by Captain Toad. during one of those missions. He's like, oh they all fucked off when it got scary. And it's like, yeah, it's sort of like they l they lack courage, the toads. They're useless stuff.

Matthew
01:54:04
Anyway, um the the worst letter you can get in Galaxy 2 is the one which has got fifty star bits. Yeah. Cause it's like that's nothing. They're just in space. They're for free. Like, it's uh I can just m walk in any level and accidentally pick up fifty star bits, like

Samuel
01:54:21
Come on. He's been also posthod's been upgraded to like one of your sort of like main staff. Like he's right next to the fucking like cockpit of your big head spaceship. And so he's like been upgraded to like a key character, and you're like, whoa, whoa, I never thought post toad was good. I always thought he was bad. Um and by always I mean like last week when I played the first game. Um anyway, um

Matthew
01:54:41
I think those are some now the good thing is is that now that you are past this, you are literally post Toad, so you don't have to worry about it.

Samuel
01:54:48
Those are really my only least favourite galaxies. I don't really I did think the Spring Mario level, I'm sorry, there's like a balance beam you have to go across where there's these rolling chomps coming down. And that's just shit, man. That's just shite. It just is. It that's worse than anything else in this game. So that was I was disappointed after having my expectations set sky high by the first excellent Chompworks galaxy level, Matthew. So what are your least favourite?

There's a snowy one called Freezy Flake where you use fireballs to destroy like snowy gumbas. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a slight wherever. That any fire flower again. It's a duffer. I I think Bee Mario gets quite an underpowered outing in this one. Honey Bloom and Honey Hop Galaxies just sort of reheats of the honey levels from the first one. I I'm not I I'm you know I am a big fan of the motion controlled ball rolling and racing on the manta rays in the first one, all that stuff. I'm sign me up. I will I'm I'm very pro-waggle, I'm very waggle competent, I like all that stuff. But the uh motion controlled bird gliding levels, I am not into those. As soon as they're done, huge sigh of relief. Just Don't have to do that again. Find it very, very stressful trying to like race the birds and hit the gate so that you get the star comet at the end the star medal, the comet medal thing. Yeah, most of it I like. Yeah, it's a pr pretty good game. It is it is a pretty good game. No, it's a l uh a lot of fun. There's uh one of the S World levels, I can't remember what it's called, but Think it might be one of the bonus stages from Super Mario Sunshine where you don't have a backpack. reused where it's just like a load of abstract wooden blocks spinning in space. Really, really simple, but it's it's just a a very pure little bit of platforming which I really like. It's it's kind of a bit like with Throwback Galaxy, it's like, oh this is what Mario Sunshine would have been like if Mario didn't control like total ass in that game. Right. The frustration, the depths of frustration you have felt on Mario Galaxy 1 and 2. That's how I feel about most common stars, like the easier stars in Marion Sunshine. Oof. We were talking uh, you know, before this about whether there was a Mario Sunshine episode potentially in the offing and I just think if you've had this time with Mario Galaxy One and Two, I think Sunshine would I think it would break both of us.

Samuel
01:57:20
Right. Well I'm go I've got it in my Switch right now. I'm gonna play it after this podcast.

Matthew
01:57:25
I'm so fascinated. I'm telling you, it's a motherfucker.

Samuel
01:57:34
Well as long as I I don't my thing is I'm not really a completionist when it comes to Mario games. I'm a I'm happy to be a a sort of like f you know. Play through it and then a little bit on top, you know. So I think even the the core path of that game is way too hard.

Matthew
01:57:49
Okay, interesting. But we'll see. We'll see, we'll see, you know. Yeah We'll see what happens. Okay. Well uh You'll come back to Galaxy and be like blessed Blessed rolling masterpiece Galaxy, you are genius after all. All is forgiven the chimp. Lovely Tool Trunk Galaxy.

Samuel
01:58:05
Fuck Tool Trunk Galaxy. give for tall trunk. Yeah I'd be there thinking I'll be in that fucking Delfino square gun. I really wish I had a post toad right now saying that to myself. Um I did want to ask about the the brief use of like time freezing powers in this, Matthew, and how clearly that is, you know, that's probably the signature power of Astrobot, isn't it? Him doing that. um and it's very impressively rendered. And I do like how it's used here, but it's used so sparingly here, the the time freezing. Um is it picked up at all in Odyssey, the time freezing, or is it is right is Astrobot just take what's here and then basically build a whole kind of like entire sets of levels around it.

Matthew
01:58:46
The way it's used here is it's tied to set switches on the floor. I think it's used in like three stages. Yeah, that's cool. And it's basically Here's an obstacle that's moving inhumanly fast, hit this switch, and now you can go through that obstacle. Like The the difference is and it is why the Astrobot power is so impressive, because in Astrobot you can deploy it whenever you want and so you're making the decision to slow down a level at a particular point. Like you're solving it. Where I think the fact that you're tied to these switches means a lot of the the thinking's done for you in in Marriott Galaxy 2. Like it's it's it's like a nice enough visual effect and everything, but I I'd say the the Astrobot power version of it uh trumps it.

Samuel
01:59:32
That's almost a power that's so good you could build a whole game out of it. Arguably they should have done, because none of the other powers I mean I do like the levels where you can really shrink down, but I'm not a big monkey climb guy, for example. So um yeah, I don't know. Um I guess we'll see how that debugs.

Matthew
01:59:50
That should be one jet pack.

Samuel
01:59:51
Yeah, that's okay, that's fair enough. I guess But you put it like that, mini shoot adventures is better than that, Matthew. So just a couple more questions before we go. Um do you think there's anywhere left to go with the Galaxy Formula once you reach the end of this game?

Matthew
02:00:06
I mean in terms of like the t the technol technology they have now and the fact that, you know, they always say in these interviews, oh the limitations here and the limitations there, the idea of them not building you know, ten massive themed worlds, a la Donkey Kong, but doing loads of scatter shot things where they can experiment with you know, whatever physics and power and you know, all the effects that that are available to them now that aren't available in Galaxy. Uh you know, I wouldn't say no to a Galaxy 3. Could that happen off you know, with Galaxy being the the m the movie? I don't know.

Samuel
02:00:44
Yeah, it's funny that that is the focus of the film, isn't it? That does make you think that They've magnified their thinking around what Mario Galaxy offered in terms of setting. And you know, yeah, like you say, I I would imagine that if they did it again, this is just my prediction. I think they would abandon the spherical, tiny world nature of it a little bit. I think they might do something a bit more I think you might see some worlds like that, but I think they might also do a bit more of a conventional You know, so in some ways bonanza does have a bit of galaxy energy, doesn't it? Like the different layers are like going to new galaxies. They feel like new places, you know.

Matthew
02:01:20
You know, what happens if they did it as a you know, a bit more open world and had like little planets you're on, but you can fly from those planets to another planet and and actually move between them in real time wasn't

Samuel
02:01:33
Yeah, absolutely. I I thought about that a bit a bit a bit playing this. Um yeah, so I think I agree with you. I think this I'd love to see what happens if you come back to this with what is it like three generations worth of progression?

Matthew
02:01:45
Um yeah, because well you know it's it's like the thing with the the Astrobot slow down power. You know, you can do something like that. you know, in a game where you have you know a bit more kind of stuff going on under the hood, why not supercharge some of their older ideas that way?

Samuel
02:01:59
Yeah, I mean isn't there's also like a pretty handsome looking galaxy or two in Super Mario 3D world that is like it's deliberately themed around Galaxy. Um and just to see all that all those kinds of assets in HD, you're like, oh man, these are like It's a fucking handsome setting when they're they're doing this with HD graphics. They should really go back to this and give this another shot. I agree with you. I think that's um That I don't know if that I I actually I should cannot work out what their their strategy is around Mario, but um wouldn't be surprised if something galaxy themed is um is in the offing, Matthew, for the reason you mentioned there. Um and finally, because I think we already did to cover the point I had in our plan about 3D land and 3D world. There is definite connective tissue between this game and those games. Pitch me your idea for a Mario Galaxy level, Matthew.

Matthew
02:02:47
I would do a level where each planetoid, it's the history of Nintendo consoles.

Samuel
02:02:52
Hmm.

Matthew
02:02:52
Yeah, you land on a NES and you walk around that and you can like press the buttons and certain things would happen and then you'd go through them. Obviously so in I mean R what I have described there is basically like ten cubes in succession, which is maybe not the most exciting thing in the world. But You know, imagine walking across like an original Game Boy and it's playing like Super Mario Land on the or you jump on the buttons to control the game. on a giant Game Boy. Yeah, I quite like that. That's um He didn't feel that excited by that idea.

Samuel
02:03:27
Sorry. Did I not sound but I I I I think like Was that too academic?

Matthew
02:03:31
Was I meant to be like Oh the it's the floating heads, except each one is the head of someone who runs a sandwich shop in bar. Is that what I'm saying?

Samuel
02:03:43
Do you think me so cynical at this stage of making a podcast? Incident Mario sh headshit We're walking around on JC's head? No, it was I just saw him uh earlier actually and uh that was weird walking past him. Anyway. You didn't think like Good level, that. Oh god. Yeah, you just get stuck in this habanero source. You have to spin the controller to get it off of you. No, I wasn't thinking like that. I was more thinking like. I think just because I know you like the big cosmic swings they take in this. I I don't think there's anything wrong with that idea, let me be very clear. Um but I'm actually surprised he went with something that was a bit more like referential about Nintendo itself. Um so I sort of like I got four different ones here, right? So a first one is more of a note on an existing level. That big evil pumpkin head in Battle Belt Galaxy should have come alive. Like they teased What That's so specific. Well but they but they tea like the little thumbnail image for that level is like is the pumpkin head. And it is cool when you land on it, but it's got little kind of like um the little space gem things where the eyes are. And then it never does anything. Then you jump to another planet and then you The battle and the enemies on each of these planets in quick succession. That's a solid little level apart from the stupid fucking optional snake boss, as mentioned. But I just think that The game avoids doing anything scary. And the first game has quite a few scary bits in it. Has you fighting that undead fish underwater? Not a very good level, but quite scary. As you're going in that big stone whale and then all the boos appear at the end and it's a little bit kind of horror-ish. I think this game deliberately avoids doing anything that's even vaguely scary and sticks to that blue sky thing. And I think it could just stand to be a bit stranger. Um, I kind of wish they did something a bit more in the cosmic horror sort of monster space. Like a big undead Bowser could have been cool, for example. Like they don't even do anything as weird as the Dark Matter galaxy in the first game, where it's like Wh where the fuck did Bowser get his hands on all this weird dark matter that smushed across these levels? Like it just you know, it's just a bit of a bit of strangeness. Again, like they've just sanded off the edges of that. And I think that Something fighting something like undead in space would have just been quite cool. Um but my my main two ideas were like um I did start with the humorous idea of what if you ran across a giant human ass, right? But eventually came up with the idea of like, what if you're running across this like big silver sort of synthetic man. Um like that weird chap out of Earthbound, whatever that guy is. Um and like what if you sort of like you have to reactivate this body that's been sort of like deactivated by Bowser And like you basically have to run to different parts of the nervous system. Like jumpstart his heart and sort of like boot all of Bowser's goons off of his extremities and all this stuff. And then at the end, like this giant Huge man just sort of like wakes up and sort of like looks down at you as Mario. Something like that that sort of You should be doshing the giant. Yeah, perfect. Just something sort of like huge and human that again would look really strange in space and quite quite freaky, but also very impressive in terms of scale. That's like almost too specific an idea. Um and then finally but this giant man whose whose extremities are covered in Goombas.

Matthew
02:07:01
Well, I'll write that down.

Samuel
02:07:04
Send that straight to Miyamoto. Um I had a level that's a whole solar system being pulled into a black hole while you play it. And you have to jump um between the orbiting planets of this dying sun while they're sick sucked in one by one.

Matthew
02:07:19
Yeah, sick. Yeah, I'd like that.

Samuel
02:07:20
Yeah, so like it's just each planet is different, but th then the planet disappears behind you along with all the enemies on it and You have to have it like it's like a different method to kind of get off of each one. I guess I was thinking a bit about the way that Battle Belt Galaxy is structured here, but the idea of like a black hole eating planets is just a cool Cool idea.

Matthew
02:07:38
Um they should introduce they should have uh a planet which is near a black hole, like an interstellar, and and you go to the level and it's four minutes, but when you come back everyone's a skeleton on Mario's head 'cause you've been away for like twenty years. I do rubbers just like old as fu yeah.

Samuel
02:07:53
Those guys who like um It's like where were you?

Matthew
02:07:56
We never thought you were coming back

Samuel
02:07:58
The guys who chopped the boomerangs at you are like too old to throw the boomerangs now and they just sat there sort of like contemplating um the nature of time. Post toad now just gets everything by email.

Matthew
02:08:10
Where were you?

Samuel
02:08:14
Post Toad's been replaced by like Toad AI. Uh he's been sort of completely completely supplanted. Um and my final level, Matthew Is I think they should have done something like a space battle. Um almost like Star Fox style where you jump between all these different cruisers having like a big um sort of space jewel or whatever. Maybe it could be like a toad fleet versus a Cooper or Goomba fleet. And like basically the end goal of it is to run into this Bowser like Death Star thing and kinda like blow it up from the inside and then you run out as the thing's exploding around you. Um and I thought you could use the drill to cross from like one side of a spaceship to the other, so you're using that to kind of navigate. um these like um yeah these big cruisers that are in space. But in general I think there's more they could do in this game with spaceships and that kind of thing. Um anyway. Those are all my ideas.

Matthew
02:09:04
I like the idea of doing it like a shot for shot remake at of the end of Star Wars and New Hope, except instead of a proton torpedo down the exhaust. It's just you spinning a big green coconut down there. Uh indeed, yes, that's that's almost Um saying use the force.

Samuel
02:09:22
Well anyway, I hope you enjoy my fanfiction ideas there, Matthew, for um Oh that was so much better than run across a big Game Boy, but so it goes. Well it's okay, it's a Sunday, isn't it? We both tried in in our different ways. And um you've been thinking about these games for like decades and this is all new to me. So I'm I'm sort of like um I've got f you know fresh takes um to deploy here and there. Well that's it Matthew. The episode's done. That's like, you know, just over four hours on two games that we did in a week there. That's uh feels like a complete work we've done there. Are you happy with the uh re examining these games in podcast form? Oh, I've had a great time.

Matthew
02:09:55
I I love playing these games. Love being reminded that yeah, I I still really, really rate them. They're amazing.

Samuel
02:10:01
Yeah, and so you know, we always enjoy making these two giant men play episodes and You may have noticed that Gram Theft 46 has been uh delayed, and that's the thing that happened since we last recorded. And as an ex as a result of that, we're actually going to extend our season of GTA episodes into next year. So you will see two giant men play Grand Theft Water 5 and two giant men play Red Dead Redemption 2. in the podcast schedule before GTA six releases in twenty twenty nine, which is when I think it's going to release, um based on current pens. And we have talked about perhaps doing this with the Legend of Zelda Wind Waker next year, Matthew, haven't we? So that's on the cards potentially. Um we'll see about that one. But for now, people know where to get us on social media, Matthew. I'll just say thank you to the listeners for their support on Patreon as ever. And uh goodbye. See you later. Goodbye.
