Hello and welcome to the back page of video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew. We've come back to doing one of these best games of X year podcasts, and I always enjoy these. Probably more than any other type of episode that we do. There's a good mix of mag memory stuff of game memory stuff. Do you get as excited about them as I do?

Matthew
00:46
Yeah, I mean it doesn't have the the the same thrill as the risk of you potentially being put to death in Games Court. Um but after that, yeah, definitely it's it's um like the the best sort of uh cocktail of of uh what I think we do best on this podcast.

Samuel
01:02
Yeah, uh Games Court is in recess. Is that a thing that they do in court? I think that's a good idea. Yeah.

Matthew
01:07
Um, why not?

Samuel
01:09
Wario is um you know is up to other stuff and the monkeys have been returned to their various um to their habitat in Rhythm Heaven. So yes, uh this year then Matthew, we're doing twenty ten in this episode. So this is such a kind of monster year. I was wondering what you made of it because when it came to Assembling a top ten for this year. I could easily do 20 games I love from this year. And I have a lot of honourable mentions. Were you in the same boat with this?

Matthew
01:35
Yeah, absolutely. I like I have about ten games in also runs that will that also runs? Also runs? Either way. that were at one point like in the main list and I just kept seeing things and going, Oh, of course that, I've got to put that in. I think I've ended up creating a bit of a Frankenstein list that's kind of half sort of head choices, some heart choices, and it's all kind of getting mixed in, the order is probably massively off.

Samuel
02:03
Yeah, you said that you were doing quite a lot of surgery before this episode, right? Changing things around as well.

Matthew
02:08
Yeah, I just Th the thing about this year is it's like a classic year for games in terms of just like the critical consensus around certain games. But it's also like a year where on Wii and DS anyway, I there there are so many like Matthew essential titles, things that just really, really spoke to me that maybe aren't as critically acclaimed or definitely aren't as critically acclaimed and so that really threw me off because sometimes I was looking at some things and like this means a lot to me but you know, is it churlish not to include XYZ because of this?

Samuel and/or Matthew
02:46
So yeah, we'll see what happens.

Samuel
02:49
I think what's good on that front is that my list This is probably the era that I wasn't paying attention to Nintendo at all. So there's not a single DS or Wii game on my list. And I have not played Super Mario Galaxy 2. I know that's a a a big omission, but Um I had my head just in HD console games at this time, so my list is entirely made up of those basically. And it's a banner year for those. But um yeah, like a surprisingly good year for Nintendo as well. It's um I I I think I always assumed at this point that the Wii was sort of dying down a little bit, but I don't know, you not when you look at this year. It looks like it's in rude health, or that maybe this is like a wave of games that have emerged as a result of the early success of the Wii and this is developers catching up a little bit. Do you think there's anything in that?

Matthew
03:36
Yeah, yeah, probably. I mean it's it's kind of interesting. It's it's sort of an unexpected year in that it's like surprisingly hardcore. sort of following the kind of kind of casual wave which I think, you know, was sort of reached the low point the year before where they're really riding to be a little bit of a you know, the the new audience that we've courted and then like all of a sudden you get this like rush of like revivals of quite strange stuff or quite kind of experimental takes on some like popular characters. Yeah, I know I was looking at our covers. This was a great run for Endgamer, I think. It was just um we had so much stuff. Like there's there's there's not really a a bad cover choice uh apart from there's a super scribble naught's cover um in February but outside of that like i they're you know, they're just great games, they aren't just there out of necessity. So th yeah, it was I'd somehow I'd sort of forgotten like how good we had it. I think we were just so drunk on games. that that it it it kind of uh there's so many highs in there and they all kind of mix together that I've I I'd I had forgotten just how good we had it and Like DS as well kind of has a bit of a spectacular run because the year 3DS gets announced. So for for a console for a you know machine that late in its lifespan. To have this kind of second wind. Yeah, it was yeah, quite unusual.

Samuel
04:59
I think by comparison, HD consoles were really just in the prime of their life as well. You'd had obviously like um two thousand seven and eight, just uh you know, that uh first kind of wave of amazing blockbusters. But in the second wave you were getting a series that had already had one entry on uh HD consoles coming back for another round. Um you had, you know, uh different takes on certain genres that developers specialized in that really kind of took off this year. You had a couple of games from developers who have been working on uh these titles for a long, long time, and I'm talking like years and years that finally emerged this year. Two of the games in my list were games that I had been waiting for for four or five years. And so, you know, it was it ended up being a big year, just well, just a massive year for PS3 and Xbox 360. So Yeah, I was um I was excited going over this stuff. So, Matthew, when we do these episodes, we ought to always talk a bit about what we were doing in mags at the time. So What was um Endgamer like in 2010?

Matthew
05:59
It was it was great. I felt like the mag had been kind of going long enough that it had sort of developed this kind of good kind of rapport with its readers, you know. Everything was very like established at this point. We had our fiftieth issue, which was this big sort of anniversary issue. We did this big feature which was quite a nostalgic look back and I think when you look back over forty-nine issues Reading that feature again now, I was thinking, oh yeah, like we had done a lot of stuff, like we'd created this quite sizable chunk. of kind of you know magazine coverage that we could kind of dip back into and you know the running jokes were really established. We had all these weird little kind of comic characters. It had kind of hit the space w which I think back on on N sixty four and NGC most fondly, which is when they're a bit into their runs and they just really know what they're about and everyone's very kind of confident in itself and that coinciding with Just a great year for games, great year for covers. You know, that that magazine, I think that's probably like its best stretch I'd say it's b i its two best stretches was the very first year. where I think Mark Green was just like powering us towards this like Nintendo Mania and this year where we w we just really knew what we were what we wanted to do with it.

Samuel
07:15
Hmm. That's really cool. That's a nice position to be in for sure. Just a really kind of like concentrated um team dynamic. That's um that's rad. Uh for me I was on X three sixty at the start of this year, which was the um uh you know, I'm sure many of our listeners aren't familiar with this magazine, but it was a an independent Xbox magazine, one of the best selling ones. And um it was a pretty straightforward, simple magazine, but we did start to do some interesting things with it, like more interesting types of features and stuff, trying to make it a bit spicier. And mentioned on the two thousand nine episode I really love this team. Uh it was quite a tough year because I got moved from this magazine to SciFi Now. And so it was honestly just a bit of a bummer. It was ended up being probably in the long run, it might have been the thing that end You you might if I hadn't done this, I might not have been editor of PC Gamer one day because this taught me a lot about Madcraft. So I think I do owe this year of my m of um working on uh sci-fi now a lot. It was a TV and film magazine. It was good, but it was like a a completely different world to games media where it's like, you know, you ask a publisher, can I interview this dev? They either say yes or no. Here it's like, you know, okay, the Dark Knight Rises is coming out. We know we won't get Christopher Nolan, so who might we get at like an absolute push? So that's like kind of where we were at. We had some some good access and some really good freelancers. But generally speaking, I didn't I didn't enjoy this year so much. Cypher now got better over time and became more fun and um we did some more interesting things with it. I was curious, Matthew, when it comes to the pop culture side of things. We always talk a little bit about what's going on TV and film at this time. So was there anything from this year that you saw as a highlight? I picked out some um Some highlights here. I thought Inception was a big movie this year.

Matthew
08:53
This was a weird year for me because I was like really like going hard magazine wise and I I was doing loads of freelance as well. This was like quite a uh a lucrative year in terms of I got to write about some quite juicy stuff for like Edge. You know, I did like Heavy Rain and Red Dead Redemption and things like that. So that was that was like super exciting. So I was looking back over what was big culturally and a lot of it kind of passed like Didn't pass me by but didn't write it like didn't really register with me. I think I was I was just in such a endgamer mania zone. that a lot of it didn't register. Did What was what was big for you? I mean 'cause this might spark some better memories.

Samuel
09:33
Yeah, sure. So um Inception was the big film this year. I was kind of um I think working on sci-fi now I was slightly obsessed with that because it was like, you know, this obviously this big budget original sci-fi film. And unlike Tenor, it wasn't completely incomprehensible. Um so, you know, a plus one for Christopher Nolan there. Uh The Walking Dead started this year. A big thing that happened on Cypher Now was that All of the old shows they used to cover died out and we had some months where it's really, really hard to figure out what to do with the magazine. Culminating in a Caprica cover. Remember Caprica? Battlestar Galactica spinoff?

Matthew
10:03
Just um Oh yeah.

Samuel
10:05
Yeah, kinda like look like Gataka, but it was a bit it was a bit of a dud. An interesting idea, but it didn't quite um take off. So we were kind of like starred for stuff, then The Walking Dead comes along and suddenly it's like, oh Frank Darabont's made a zombie show and it's like actually pretty cool. It wasn't It was never quite as good as it people said it was, The Walking Dead, even in its early days when it was really good. But obviously, while it had John Bernthal, it was like Terrific, I thought. And so when he goes, it becomes a completely pointless TV show, I think. But um, you know, obviously it's been running for years and years, so uh Je have Justified as well, that started this year, and Boardwalk Empire, those were like big, you know.

Matthew
10:42
Yeah, you say that it's reminder, so it It it was during that these years in the summer I I started going to ComicCon with with a a very good friend of mine who lives over in the States, Cosyrus. And um I used to go and stay with Cyrus and then we'd go and see we'd go he he lived in New York and we'd we'd have a we'd sort of bookend it with some time in New York and then we'd go over to L uh to San Diego. It and do um Comic Con and so we yeah, used to see this stuff up uh being an announced and things. But did I tell you about the inception thing?

Samuel
11:13
I don't think so. I've heard some of your Comic Con stories, including quite a traumatizing flight story you told me a few days ago, which probably can't be repeated on the air, but um Yeah. Uh no w beforehand, yeah, it was it

Matthew
11:24
Yeah, it was this year we went to see uh Inception in this in a cin in the IMAC in an IMAC cinema in New York and uh we were sitting at the bat, we queued up quite early to get good seats and we were like right in the back row so we had like this amazing view. Then ten minutes before the film started this cinema attendant guy came over to us and was like We d w do you my guys mind if you move? Because Mick Jagger wants your seats And we were like what? We 'cause we didn't know if this was like some scam just to get us out of our seats. And if it was, it was quite a weird scam and they were like Yeah, you know, we w we he'd like to sit here and we have to remove the seats around 'cause he doesn't want anyone sitting next to him. Right. So like, you know, we'll move you into these other seats here and And so yeah, we shifted down and like lo and behold, like a minute before the film started, Mick Jagger came and sat down. Right. And he had his like entourage. behind him, like lining the back of the cinema. And it was really distracting. Cause I like Inception's not like like a hilarious film No, famously not so much. But there are a couple of jokes in it. And like Mick Jagger's got just a really distinctive laugh. Like you can just hear his voice, you know, when you it's ri you know, and so You know, I was watching this film kind of my mind blown, but also like ten percent of my brain was definitely distracted by like Mick Jagger. The whole thing. And he rushed out at the end and we went over to his seat and we stole all his sweets. You Um so I ate I ate Mick Jagger's Crunchy bits, or whatever they're called.

Samuel
12:54
That's good. When we launch the Patreon Matthew, we can then put out a badge that says I ate McJagger's crunchy bits. That's uh that could be a thing. Yeah, I just uh I can sort of imagine, you know, Tom Hardy going, You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger darling, and then Mick Jagger go whatever he does. Sort of sounds like he's in the middle of, you know, a concert or something.

Matthew
13:15
Um I guess it's like seeing your mates on like when you see Michael Cain like you're gonna have a bit more affection for him because you're like, oh it's my mate Michael Cain. Ha ha ha you know like I'd laugh if I saw you in Inception doing anything. Oh yeah. You know. I'd be like, oh my god it's Sam

Samuel
13:33
Yeah, I suppose so, yeah. I mean that Michael Cain's role in that film is preposterous. Isn't he like uh in America as a dream uh logic professor or whatever it is that um So yeah, it was a that was that was like the big thing. And then yeah, um I started watching a lot of Justified after it was actually quite a good accompaniment to Red Dead Redemption as well, because it had sort of like western vibes. So um And uh you know John Marston's a little bit Timothy Oliphant-ish, you imagine he is probably one of the many influences on that character. So yeah, yeah. And um yeah, that was kind of what was going on, Matthew. But um I was curious about trips. Did you do anything fun trips this year? I had a couple of ones, but um, what about you?

Matthew
14:11
Yeah, I got to go to Tokyo. This this was the year of the Dragon Quest trip. Oh yeah. Um, where I interviewed the um Or the developers with their massive piles of cigarette ash and which put me at ease. We talked about that on the interviews episode. You should go back and listen to that. Great story. This was such a lucky trip because it was an official Nintendo trip and they were on a deadline, so none of their guys could go. Or Oh, what a pisser. I mean, great for me. I uh you know this was just it was like you get to go and just have like oh I mean we were there for almost a week. It was just the purest luxury because this is this is Nintendo like riding high things hadn't kind of gone gone a bit 3DS for them yet. But yeah this trip was yeah all this time in Tokyo We you know we did a tour of all the dragon quests of hotspots. We went to a uh bar which was a dragon quest themed tavern. Which meant they played the Dragon Quest Tavern music, which is an earworm to end all earworms, and they played it solidly for four hours while we ate. foods which were roughly based on Dragon Quest monsters, so I ate some jellyfish for a blue slime. Nice. Um while being hammered with this music felt a bit like some kind of torture, to be honest.

Samuel
15:29
Um but it made for like a good feature. So that's really cool. I I had a couple this year. I went to X10 in San Francisco. I told this story on the uh Maximum Power Up podcast episode that we went on, but um this felt like a significant moment to me because It was Microsoft's own kind of like not E3 scale event, but a a big ish media event where they booked a venue in San Francisco and then showed off all of their upcoming games. And there they had Fable III, Halo Reach. Crackdown 2, uh Dead Rising 2, they're like the perfect dark remaster there. It was basically every big Microsoft game or series was there. Like, you know, you had your Peter Molyneux there, Sam Lake, people like that And it felt really significant in retrospect as like the last moment where Microsoft was super, super hardcore because this is obviously the year of Connect. So um after this things Turn a little bit sour for a few years. They still put out some good games, but obviously Microsoft's been on a hell of a run in the episodes that we've been covering um, you know, these years. 2006, 7, 8, 9. They are just Microsoft is unbelievable on an unbelievable run. And obviously we know that this path leads to, you know, them basically having to completely reset things. Um you know, ab about five or six years down the line. So yeah, it's um it felt like a it felt like a big moment. It was definitely a fun trip. It was definitely cool to interview like, you know uh bungee on the last Halo game it would it would make and you know uh Sam Lake it was the first time I'd seen him in person. There's a novel aspect to seeing Sam Lake in person as um a Max Payne fan that you just can't

Matthew
17:00
You can't be asking to do the face.

Samuel
17:02
Well I feel like he's spent his whole life been asked to do the face. But he just looks super cool. He was even wearing like a Max Payne leather jacket and I just thought Oh he was leaning into it. Yeah, I mean you would right if you were Max Payne, like uh yeah, famously. So yeah, that was um that was an uh that was an awesome trip for sure. Incidentally, Matthew, did you see the guy on RealMuck who called us um games gammers for talking about magazine? Did you see that?

Matthew
17:27
Yeah, you linked to it 'cause people had written some really nice stuff about the podcast. I was like, Oh, that's so nice. It's really great, like people are digging this behind it. Um and then it was just like an arrow to the heart.

Samuel
17:38
That was really I read it and I was like It it was like oh tele it's like you know old boars down the pub telemagazine anecdotes and I was there thinking you do you do know the name of the podcast as the back page right. I mean it's right there I thought yeah, I uh apologies for inconveniencing you with my free podcast, but um but everyone else is really nice in that thread. But it did um It did make me slightly self conscious about coming on and telling stories. It's like, well, no, that is kind of like uh definitely part of the c the gate of the podcast. Yeah, exactly. Um But yeah, I wondered if you'd seen that. Because um I thought I've been called a gammon at the age of thirty-three. That's like the most personal possible insult for someone who's like liberal.

Matthew
18:19
And um and in g in in the sphere of games, you know, are we the g like does that you know, maybe we do qualify as we are the gamons of a relatively progressive space?

Samuel
18:30
I don't know. I don't think so. I'm pretty progressive. I um but you know, I could handle a bit of criticism. I've just been looking at some of the um the uh stuff that the Twitch um uh streamers have been protesting against the hate raise are just so so awful. So to be called a gammon is really like pretty small. Fry comp by comparison. Yeah.

Matthew
18:47
And we we appreciate anyone who listens to it. You know, you you're obviously entitled to have any opinion on this podcast. But thanks for listening.

Samuel
18:55
Anyway, back to uh a rambling bullshit mag story from eleven years ago. Um So yeah, I w when I moved on to Sci-Fi now, there was like a phenomenon in magazines where I don't know if it still happens because we're not really in the age of trips anymore. because of the pandemic, but they would basically if you were in quote unquote mainstream press, as in you weren't covering video games sort of as your main focus. They would often fly you out for quite fancy trips for like minimal coverage. The big guy who's like, Oh, I'm I'm just here from a film magazine. I'm only here to write a paragraph on like a four-day trip, and you're like, well, okay, that sounds like, you know basically a holiday, but I had one of those for Star Wars the Force on Leash 2 and I got taken to Skywalker Runch, which was really cool. Um I'd been to the uh Lucasfilm before, the Digital Letterman Center in San Francisco, which is lovely. Has the um famous Yoda statue outside and loads of cool props and stuff, but Skywalker Runch felt like a a much bigger deal. Uh basically though it whipped It didn't really amount to much. There was um it it was kind of novel to go there, but it's like a a a long, flat, kind of hot, but sort of like dry farm type area. with, you know, like a Skywalker Sound recording studio built into it in Marine County.

Matthew
20:08
Not our natural habitat.

Samuel
20:09
No, exactly. And um I was just like absolutely sweltering. And their big colored plan for the day was to basically have all the press wield these toy lightsabers in front of the lake outside Skull Crunch while a ventriloquist dressed as Obi-Wan Kanobi With a dummy of Yoda on his arm taught people uh Jedi stuff. And Lucasfilm were gonna film this and put it out as a promo item. And I was probably at the peak of my like, I won't just sell out for any old shit attitude. Um you know, these days I might just be quietly compliant, even though I'd hate it, but Basically, I just refused to participate and went and sat in the shade while this went on. And it was a little bit like um I don't know, maybe I'm sort of like killing the buzz of the uh event slightly. But I just thought I can't be used I cannot see myself being used as like a uh someone like a bit of promo material swinging a toy lightsaber. To I don't know, in uh in front of this like dude just to sell like a bad Star Wars game. I just like I thought what if it goes viral and my life is fixed now? What if I become the new Star Wars? Exactly, yeah. I thought it was a really flawed idea.

Matthew
21:23
And to be honest, like the thing is Them getting footage of someone throwing a wobbly and going off and sitting under a tree is more likely to go viral.

Samuel
21:32
Yeah. The thing is, it was like it was still a kind of cool trip, because just the the the ac the actually just being there, you're like, I'm so close to like the heart of beating heart of Star Wars right now. And it's obviously in the pre-Disney days, I feel like Disney will probably never do this stuff, but Lucasfilm were a bit more I don't know, autonomous or whatever. But um basically yeah, that was like a a big sort of highlight. We couldn't go in the cool house that had all the props in it though, because he was meeting with writers for that TV show that never came out, Underworld I think it was called. Oh no. Um of which apparently a hundred episodes were written.

Matthew
22:03
During that meeting George Lucas had looked out the window and saw you. Getting cross about not wanting to use a light. Get that man off my fucking ranch right now. He's like, that guy's got integrity.

Samuel
22:17
Yeah. Would you like to write Rogue One son, like uh I like the cut of your jib. Yeah. Um yeah, so it's a shame because the house is where all the cool stuff is, like the um when uh Gareth Edwards made Rogue One and he Found those footage of the X-Wing pilots in The New Hope that was unused and cut it into the film. That was the house where it was. And that Indiana Jones Whip was in there and stuff. So all I did, Matthew, was complain in the sun. That's me and Skywalker Runch. I also um met the guy who played Starkiller, um uh Sam Whitwer, who was also in Days Gone. Uh they asked me if I wanted a photo with him. And like, I just thought I don't want to be photographed with a man who's this much more handsome than me and I just sort of politely declined. I just thought went, I'm I'm I'm I'm alright, thanks. That's alright. I'll I'll just leave it this time. Uh so that was me um with the Force Unleash 2 trip Matthew. Do you have any more trip stories or should we get into uh No that was that was basically it I mean that was just such a you know it was such a mammoth thing.

Matthew
23:09
I was so lucky to to, you know, go to Tokyo and get to do all that. I I I remember when we were on that shit on that Tokyo trip, there was this bar in Rapongi where if you ring this bell, you basically buy everyone in the bar a drink. And someone from Nintendo went a bit loopy with this bell and just kept ringing it and and like by the end of the night the receipt they had was like twice the length of their body. It was like meters and metres of receipt. That's and I I remember just thinking like You've probably like that's you know that's feasibly like a couple of issues of Endgamers budget right there on that receipt. They were just wild. They were like flying high and they flew us out like business class and everything. It was just crazy times. Again, good times.

Samuel
23:59
I'm sure that uh uh sales of Dragon Quest IX on DS in the UK broke even on that trip. But that's that sounds like a lot of fun. That's cool. Did the uh Dragon Quest devs go with you? I'm guessing not.

Matthew
24:10
No, we only saw like the the way they were treated was just so you know, they're they're you know they're such legendary figures that it was this it was a super controlled environment, like there would be no weirdness or awkwardness for them and That was clearly like the focus of the trip was just making sure that that like one 20-minute conversation went smoothly. You can just sometimes tell when someone's around that they're important and they were

Samuel
24:36
So yeah, fair enough. I wonder if uh Yuji Hori's forgiven me being uh late for my Gamescom interview in 2017 yet. I'll um I'll give I'll give that some more thought. So Matthew, let's take a break there then. We'll come back with a pretty short section on the lay of the land for this year before we get into the games. Let's do it. Welcome back to the podcast. So as people who've listened to these um this series of uh episodes that that we've done have uh probably noticed by now we always do something on what's going on in the industry at this point just to give a bit of context for the games we're discussing Uh this year, I I think we can be a lot shorter because it's not very interesting. I watched the Sony and Microsoft E3 conferences from this year and I thought they were both complete duds to be honest. And my uh Nintendo, weirdly, had a good E3 conference. So Matthew, maybe we should start there. Like um, what's your memory of a Nintendo E3 this year?

Matthew
25:46
The big exciting thing is um you get 3DS shown off for the first time. The pitch of 3DS is so wild and exciting. It's kind of a perfect E3 reveal in a way. Because it's this 3D without glasses. What a you know, what an interesting pitch compared to just what everyone else had. I think this was the year with the slightly wonky Skyward Sword demo where the controller kept disconnecting and you could just sort of sense Miyamoto getting cross uh on stage but trying to put a brave face on it So like as a technical event maybe a bit shaky, but in terms of what they actually had and the fact that it was so kind of focused on on the you know, quite traditional sort of hardcore Nintendo fans. Yeah, I mean this was a great year. I always get a little confused with the C3 because they did this event in the UK, a really good event for Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M. And I sometimes I get I think I get a the two of them sort of mixed together a little bit in my head 'cause Mario Galaxy came out just before E3, so I know that wouldn't have been there. Th this year they were just really going for it and like hosting big events. They had great games they were super confident in. You know, it was just a really exciting n like version of Nintendo. Kind of all just sort of blurs into a a big old mix. I'm looking at the list of stuff they had at E three. And there's quite a lot of stuff that I'm not actually that bothered about. Yeah. Epic Mickey, for example.

Samuel
27:13
Epic Mickey. Golden Eye Wii. Oh yeah. In my notes I wrote Grainy as fuck golden eye wee.

Matthew
27:20
Yeah, this was like Quite critically acclaimed. GoldenEye Wii got an eight in edge. Yeah. I mean that's that's quite impressive. Like we gave we gave it eight to I didn't I didn't review it like I it's not it's not in my list, I will say, and it's not in my list of like almost as well, so I guess I can quickly talk about it here. That was such a strange pitch for a game. It's like it's Goldeneye, but it's got Daniel Craig in it. Yeah. Like a really strange bit of revisionist history. Because the tone of Goldeneye, the flavour of that bond, is so different to what Daniel Craig's bond was about. Yeah. But the idea that you could just replace him wholesale like that Like I'm surprised that they were even allowed to do it, really.

Samuel
27:59
Yeah, it's a a strange time and I wonder if like this this kind of couple of games that comes out of this era of uh Goldeneye and Bloodstone But kind of like maybe triggers there being a long pause with Bond and thinking like, oh what is the best way we use this? That results in I. O. Interactive eventually getting it. But I don't know, maybe it starts here because I don't I didn't get this. This was like a Call of Duty style shooter with James Bond in it. You know, all of Activision Spawn games are a bit like this. But you know, it's a it's a Cold War era Bond story. Goldeneyes, you know, much hornier and weirder than some of Daniel than Daniel Craig's films. And yeah. But maybe it's something you say, you said on many episodes, Matthew, about how when the Wii gets shown a little bit of love Maybe crack, give it a bit of a pass, you know?

Matthew
28:45
But that's a but I yeah, I just don't remember having much affection for this, even though like they did show it a lot of love and they threw a lot of money at this. Very, very shiny. I think Like, we didn't have much of a relationship with it because Activision just didn't do anything with us ever. Right. So I think like the only time he ever covered this was the review where they did like a cover with O and M and stuff. Like we just didn't have y you know, this this was the period of Activision and Call of Duty being so big that they're kind of not untouchable, but they're the y you know, they can keep their distance and it's you know, and still be absolutely fine. That didn't really work for them on we I don't think this was a big success. I'm not saying Endgamer would have turned that story around. Uh you know, our 8,000 readers or whatever it was wouldn't have uh made much of a dent. Um but yeah it it kinda had the shape of Goldeneye. Like it had the weird objective system where different difficulties have different like more objectives the harder it gets, which I always loved about Goldeneye. But fundamentally the there were too many like scripted sequences and the the the gunplay was very Call of Duty, very target gallery. Didn't have any of the character or charm. Mm had quite a big multiplayer suite which people were were sort of wild for but I don't know.

Samuel
29:58
Who was playing multiplayer on the Wii? Who was doing that?

Matthew
30:01
Yeah, this is the thing. It it never really worked like that. I just felt like that age had kind of been and gone a bit. So yeah, a strange one for them to get behind. But um nay, you know, uh d Donkey Kong Country returns as well, but we might talk about that later. Definitely an exciting year like we'd had a few years of uh You know, you you got to dread E three because it meant, you know, the people on Xbox World cattling at us for another Nintendo dreadful conference while they had like They'd resurrected all the Beatles to be on stage or something wild, you know.

Samuel
30:36
Well, who's laughing now, Matthew? Because at E32010 It this is where Microsoft starts to go off the deep end a bit. I mean, this is really subjective. Uh maybe people out there have different takes on on Connect and PlayStation moves. Which are both dominant at the C3 for Microsoft and Sony. But in retrospect, we surely have to see these as a failure. I mean, I know Kinect sold well, for sure. And like in the short term, seemed like it was a success. Then when you get to the Xbox One era, they make it mandatory and they bundle it in and suddenly the world doesn't want it anymore. And you know, motion control play seems like a fad and the the players that they're chasing, at the time, you know, uh the publishers felt very comfortable using words like casual gamers, which, you know, now we kind of see as more of a gatekeeping term really and not at that appealing to use. But at the time they're just Cynically chasing it, it feels like. They're just trying to catch up with the success of the Wii. Even though they were successful in their own right. So Microsoft starts well at the C3. It's got Gears 3, Fable 3, Hideo Kushima's on stage to show off the um Revengeance, the very short uh video they made for that. And um Halo Reaches there as well. Then it starts to get a bit weird that there's um a really long segment with some ESPN hosts that was like um critically misjudged, like For the you know, there's a worldwide audience watching E3 at this point. I remember watching the conferences in full around this time, and it really feels like Microsoft is going, here's your thing, you've had your fun, now here's our thing. And so Kudo Sonoda comes out, kind of like has a sort of bono aesthetic. I I think he might wear glasses because of some kind of like aversion to light when he's in on stage, and I completely understand that, but it seems like an affectation in um when you're an executive, it just does. And he talks up, um, this is the future of entertainment kind of like vibes, and then it cuts to a little girl talking to a tiger in connectimals. And like again, the pitch of it is completely fine. It is completely fine for you to make a game where like children can interact with animals. That's like a perfectly nice premise for a game. But Microsoft's positioning of it as like the future of entertainment was just I just really hated it. I thought it was just really maybe it's just the marketing, but it was just quite sour. And like it felt like it was replacing something that existed before that was good, and I think that's why it ends up seeming egregious in retrospect. Do you think that's fair?

Matthew
32:55
Yeah, I th I think so. You know, they'd done such a great job with just quite traditional kind of games thinking, and there's like no shame in that. I guess maybe they felt like they'd kind of hit the limit on that or they were they'd kind of maxed it out and they you know, everyone wanted a bit of like what Nintendo is doing in terms of just reaching new people, but it's It's qu you know, it's just very, very difficult to kind of force that shift and it was so obvious that they were trying to force it They were just so heavy handed with it from the off. Yeah. You know, it was kinda like, it's this now, rather than, oh, and this. Or you you know you know, we got all this great stuff and here's something else we're we're kind of testing or here's something else that you might be into and let's see if it grows, let's see if there is interest. It's like this is the future and it's just a vision that is so like starkly different from what was in that first half of the show.

Samuel
33:49
Yeah.

Matthew
33:50
It's super you know, you can see the break happen i in real time. Like that is the mo there is like a sort of, you know, before and after moment um there. And the reac I don't think the reaction was ever good. I and they stuck to their guns on this so f so stubbornly. Yeah. You know, it this is the thinking that basically derails Xbox One. You know, there is an all-in-one. It's an all-in-one entertainment system rather than a games console. It's just there just it doesn't I don't know why they stuck to it. It never felt like anyone bought into it.

Samuel
34:20
Yeah. I sort yeah, I didn't really get it either. And it's sort of like in retrospect kind of feels like, you know, obviously we know it. throws Rare into this quite dark age. We know it kind of seems to kill Fable as a series for a long, long time. It was poor short-term thinking. The thing I never understood about this, Matthew. is they were chasing the quote unquote success of the Wii, right? But the PS2 outsold the Wii. And the PS2 was a traditional games console. It had a DVD player built in that was a massive part of why it sold so well. But what they were chasing was just I don't know it was like illusory. It was like they had to tell their shareholders, oh, there's this big thing, this is big lot of like 30 million people we can reach who are not reaching right now, and so we're going after them. These two conferences are just a a complete bummer to watch, I would say.

Matthew
35:07
So Sony I I d I must admit I don't remember Sony's like at all. I I didn't have much interest in PlayStation at this time, so I wasn't really ever following them that closely.

Samuel
35:17
Yeah, th they do it the other way around. They start with the PS move stuff. And I forgot Sony was going massive on 3D at the time, which was a complete more of a dud than connect, I would say. But um Obviously they were m this is a time where Sony their whole strategy was like, well the console's just one thing in your home, but we've got all these other things that we sell. Whereas now it feels like PlayStation exists at the center of their business and everything else kind of orbits it. So their thinking here was we'll do PS Move, we'll do um 3D, and we'll show people how to get more out of this console that's been around for a few years now. They were flying high because the um PS3 uh sort of like redo they did the previous year was was actually selling pretty well. It actually did, you know, finally um pick up a bit of momentum versus Xbox the PS3. So that was fine. But yeah, PS Move was just really like lukewarm. I mean, you can I at least say about Connect, it's like an all-in-one thing. It's like, you know, impressive on at first glance. And whereas Pierce Move was like, you've got a camera, you've got two controllers, and it's just, it's not as elegant a thing. and not as exciting. So there was that. But um Sony tried to bring a bit of heat by having Gabe Newell on stage to show off Portal 2. Gabe Newell had famously slammed the PS3 a few years before, so this seemed like a big uh deal. Um and then Sony were also big on this marketing campaign around fictional executive Kevin Butler. Do you remember that? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, whereas it was a very of its time. kind of thing but people seem to quite dig it and they had him come on stage and he does bring it to life a little bit but then in terms of actual games they have infamous 2 kill zone 3 and the PSP is still limping on it gets a new God of War game Uh Ghost of Sparta, both those games were among the best on the PSP.

Matthew
36:58
Are there less appetizing names for games than Infamous 2 and Kill Zone 3? Kill Zone 3 is like a parody of a video game title. That's what an evil executive invents in like a crap, you know, in in the film Toys. Yeah, or Free Guy.

Samuel
37:17
Or like, you know Um or like Kill Zone fucking yikes. It's like that uh Spike Lee's kind of withering take on GTA in um Inside Man, you know that Yeah. Like uh he just he yeah, I I I get it, Spike.

Matthew
37:33
You like roll your eyes at it, but you roll your eyes at that too. Yeah. Imagine being a passionate kill zone fan.

Samuel
37:39
Yeah, I think that it's it was always a weird sell kill zone, just never as exciting as Halo, even though it the second and third games were pretty good, but um Yeah, so at this point it feels like Sony isn't gonna have a proper comeback this generation, but it has got a couple of years of good games still to come, so um Yeah, Twisted Metal was the other big thing they revealed this year, but I feel like that's a real kind of like American players love that series more than European players. I'm not sure why that is, but yep, so Matthew, that's pretty much the lay of the land. Connect launches in November, PS Move comes in September, OnLive launches, who cares? But you know, it was just not that exciting a year for industry stuff. But the games, they were fucking fantastic. So Shall we take a short break, come back and get into our top tens? Let's do it.

Samuel and/or Matthew
38:23
And now see our love said free. You will need the witches, Kevin Key. Find the lady of a like a man with the.

Samuel
38:36
Welcome back again. So shall we get into the top?

Matthew
38:41
Let's do it.

Samuel
38:42
Okay Do you want to go first and I'll go second? And usual rules apply of whoever's got the game higher on their list. We'll talk about it when we get to um their entry on the list. Sounds good?

Matthew
38:51
Yeah. Cool. Uh so I'm gonna kick off with one of the more obscure ones, but it's a big hard choice. It's also a a really underrated game. I'm gonna kick off with Trauma Team. on the Wii. Hmm. Came up on a previous episode, right? Yeah, we've we've mentioned it before. Yeah, we've definitely joked about it. I mean this was this is the last trauma. Trauma center game they made. Um it didn't get released in the UK. Um so it's a bit of an a bit of an annoying one to track down and play because you either need a USW or Well, you can maybe work out some other scheme for yourself. Um it's uh yeah, the last last trauma center game and my god It is the ultimate Trauma Center game. It has all the stuff you love about Trauma Centre in that it is an arcadey surgery game, but that is just one sixth of the game. So what what was the whole Trauma Centre deal? is now one discipline in a game which is about loads of medical disciplines. So it's it's it's it's wildly overstuffed. It's got six story campaigns, each of these different characters all fully realised. They're all respectively shorter than a single trauma center game, I will add, but at this point I felt like they'd examined the surgery part of the game so much that it made sense to kind of uh to branch off. So as well as surgery, uh you had first responder, which was like super fast, really quick, kind of edge of your seat, you know, early well your first response to big crimes uh accidents there was Diagnosis which was a like a visual novel section which is a bit like House. where you had to work out what was wrong with people. There was a forensic sec uh section where you used you'd you were basically investigating crimes as this sort of uh forensic specialist. There was an endoscopic surgeon which was all about guiding cameras up people's bottoms and things.

Samuel
40:46
That's the only thing I remember from when we last talked about.

Matthew
40:49
Yeah, I I should add this isn't photorealistic. You know, it makes the inside of the guts look like a wonderland. It's all like purple. It looks like a bouncy castle in there. That's quite fun. Uh there's like a bone specialist which is like drilling pit and hammering pins into bones in a kind of steady hand con uh sort of challenge. And there was six Yeah, those are the six. Yeah. So th yeah, all all these um different styles, y like you could play the campaigns individually or you could like mix and match them into like chronological order because they all kind of intertwined and told this bigger story. This was just I love it when people double down and just go wild on something really niche and the idea of like, we are just gonna make six trauma center games at once. It's a bit like the Resident Evil 5 of trauma centers. Like the Resident Evil 6 of trauma centers. It's just so much stuff. Why they didn't release this in the UK I have no idea. It was it's so classy, so much fun, one of the great unplayed Wii games, I think.

Samuel
41:53
Total heart choice, but honestly, it's it's fab. But should they bring it back from the dead, Matthew?

Matthew
41:59
Yeah, absolutely. I I think people would really dig this. Uh I think it would work brilliantly on Switch as well. Just because you could play the kind of touch screen parts of it and you know it used motion controls a lot, but the you know the Joy Cons have got a lot of that jazz in them too, so why not? Um oh I'd love for it to come back. It's really really good. It's also just because it's the same artists who do like the persona games. So it feels like it's set in the same world because all the character art is so similar. So you can sort of imagine that like if you get seriously bashed up in persona, you might end up in this game with a camera up your bum.

Samuel
42:33
Yeah, well an unfortunate fate for Ryuji there. But uh yeah. Um that's um that's cool. Uh uh is the um are the uh sort of like housey visual novel bits well written.

Matthew
42:44
Yeah, I mean that they're they're probably the least interesting bit. Right, right, right. You you're like interviewing people and I think you have to pick through like what's salient and what isn't and it's not it's not that complicated, you know. If someone comes in and they go like Yo. My favourite colour is purple and also I shat blood. Um like it's obviously that bit, you know? And it is kind of as binary as that.

Samuel
43:11
Oh dear. Does that I think I already made the uh house joke about every case is lupus um in the previous episode.

Matthew
43:18
Yeah, it's a bit more varied than that 'cause it is an Atlas game. There's like these mad fictional viruses, like in Trauma Center it was guilt. which was this like bioterrorist kind of thing that had been bred in a lab to kind of it's actually a little bit Resident Evil thinking about it. Yeah, they're really silly games, but um it's just got great great energy to it.

Samuel
43:39
Yeah. Um for some reason during our conversation there Matthew I googled the word trauma and um I just read the definition of trauma. I think that's completely thrown me off. That was like really great research by me there. Have I got trauma? Yeah, let's think. I ate some mini cheddars last night and I shat blood.

Matthew
44:01
Oh well, hang on, let me Oh yeah, I think the important thing is the mini cheddar's that's like game over. It was it was the shitty stool That you needed to focus on. I'm like oh damn it.

Samuel
44:13
Oh amazing. There you go. You could never have made it as a doctor, real Doctor Matthew. Yeah. That's a great choice though, because and it already suggests that we're gonna have uh some big variance between our games in this list. is exciting. So my number 10 then Matthew is Final Fantasy XIII. Oh okay. I'm guessing this didn't make your list right It didn't it it was on my long list of like oh these were interesting. Yeah, I've got quite a few of those in my honorable mentions. But uh this was competing with several other games for like the one heart pick of the list, like with without as much of a head pick. So Final Fantasy XIII was famously sort of reviled by some corners of the fan base because it is a linear game. You're mostly wandering down very pretty corridors. There are no towns where you can go and talk to uh different characters and stuff. So it's very streamlined down to like combat and then walking down a tunnel, having story presented to you. uh progression systems and so on and so forth. And while that you do reach a point where it opens up slightly, you get these different bounties to do, and there's like a couple of like biggish areas to explore which do look spectacular, it never really truly opens up. So it remains a contentious entry. I feel like over time people have softened to it a little bit. I think a lot of what Final Fantasy VII remake is is in this game. It's a some of the same people. And it's a really, really good combat system and progression system combined when you get deeper into the gate. The problem is it makes you wait quite a long time to like take the training wheels off and let you experiment with its different class systems. This whole thing is about basically building um sort of like pre-loaded sort of like sets of classes for your characters. Let's say like You know, you p you p you'll have two mages and then like a uh sort of like a warrior, like a physical attack character. That's like one, but then you'll have another one that's like Um saboteur which is designed to you know like um put status effects on the enemies and synergist which is designed to like boost your different characters' um stats and stuff like that. along with like a a white mage to try and like um heal your party and you can switch between them on the fly at any time so it gives you a massive amount of like tactical variety. The problem is you probably have it's probably 25 hours until the game like gives you full control of that system and you feel like you're actually making the most of it. So it's quite sort of flawed in that respect. But a lot of what I love about Final Fantasy comes down to like the feel of the thing in terms of like how it sounds and looks, what the world is like. I don't think this has got the best characters in the series. I think some of them are very, very hard to like. I quite I do I don't mind um lightning the main character. I think she's um she's fine. She's basically just cloud, it's the same archetype, but yeah, I think that The music and setting are just like classic Final Fantasy to me. They kind of fit the lineage of like by classic I mean s Golden Age, 7, 8, 10. This feels like of a piece of them, in a way that 12 didn't, for example. Um you know, twelve we talked about in this podcast, very classy game, but has a very different feeling, doesn't really feel like those kind of final fantasies. I guess like the uh Tessing and Amura character design is um defining the feel to some extent. But it's also things like the colour palette and um and the just the the melodramatic music. just feels like of a piece with those those Final Fantasy games that I loved and that had a powerful effect on me at the time. What did you make of this one Matthew?

Matthew
47:32
Yeah, I mean I will say it's a game I've never finished. I think it came with just a huge amount of baggage and a huge amount of expectation. I think coming to it later, like coming back to it later, we started replaying it like A year, a couple of years ago. And I think you're right, the kind of the actual production values, like the visual style and the music and the world of it, it feels it feels very Final Fantasy. And I also think it's it's like The linearity of it is somewhat overstated in respect to the entire series because we we replayed uh ten and I'm sure we've said this on this pod as well, like That felt that's very similar. That that is just a long path. I mean it has maybe more interesting hubs along the way, but it's you know, it's just a path. with some very pretty background art, which basically this is too. Characters hard to get into. I just voice acting on this never really did it for me, I think. Um I wonder if playing in Japanese might help. Maybe. might t take the edge of that. I never really bought into the the American voices. Um yeah combat system I I think you're just bang on with this one really. It's it's it's way more interesting than the angry internet blog posts. Yeah. Kind of would suggest it is. And it may be given like where Final Fantasy went after this or what has happened since then it can be re reevaluated as maybe not such a disaster. Yeah, I love the combat. It's great. It's almost like it's it's it's it's obviously very different to the Gambit system in 12, but it's got a bit of that kind of So it's almost like an arcade version of that. Mm. It's like a slightly more simplified, fast moving, kind of sort of altering these other moving parts in the kind of battle equation. I th I it's it's cool it's cool. It holds up it holds up well.

Samuel
49:18
Yeah, I think so. I understand that the um there's some magic in the um Xbox three sixty version backwards compatible with um more recent Xbox hardware with this. It's apparently a phenomenal way to play it. So um That's cool when it just came out of Game Pass. Just rolled out on Game Pass, so um a good time to play it and re-examine it. Like I say, it takes a long time to get going. That's like the big obstacle with this game. But for me at the time, I just I just loved it. I really yeah I I I just this was kind of what I wanted. I just wanted a Final Fantasy game that uh audio visually reminded me of the ones I really loved. It had been a long time coming. There was a lot uh a lot of expectation on this. I think it was announced in two thousand six, shown off in two thousand six. So massive, massive wait. Felt like a defining game of working in um games media for me. But um yeah, I still I still have affection for it years later and I I probably am due a replay a bit honest so um what's your number nine matthew the number nine i've got bayonetta higher on my list then what is your number nine my number nine is fable three Oh, not on my list. Wow, okay. Uh I d well that's um that's probably an interesting place to start, Matthew. So how come this didn't make your top ten?

Matthew
50:24
So I I replayed it recently and f sort of s I don't know if s s if it's unfair to say sit saw through it more easily. I love Fable. I love the Fable series. I love Albion. I love its tone, its vibe. Um I love that it isn't just uh that it basically rejects a lot of RPG thinking and and has a lot of original ideas of how you can approach things. Um I think for me this stripped back A little too much. You know, their one of their big things was accessibility and that manifests in Fable 3 in a couple of really interesting ways. Like I love the uh like the physical representation of like menus and things, like the weird vault that you go to. I think that's a really cool, interesting idea. I love that it finds a lot of visual metaphors for kind of traditional like video game kind of mechanics like leveling up and things that's really interesting. Um but as an actual like c kind of like combat character building character behavior experiment it's a little too s it's a little simpler than Fable 2. Also The game hinges on this it's kind of got this big kind of two-act structure to it. And I feel like a lot of what it does is to sort of set up these big difficult moral decisions in part two and I feel like the whole game is just sort of like sort of enslaved to these these couple of decisions and they didn't land for me in a big enough way to make that worthwhile. I feel like it's all set up and and not enough payoff.

Samuel
51:54
Yeah, I think that's all fair enough and you are operating with more recent experience of it than me. I played it I think I played this in 2015 or 2014. So a fell a fair while ago. One I thought it was technically a better experience than Fable 2 was. Like uh less blurry. Fable 2 is super blurry. Um but I think that I also I also really love the um the king being Michael Fassbender. I thought he was terrific in that in that role. I thought he was a real kinda like awful bastard, like real kinda pointy simple figure. I think that all of that is fair, like it does hit fast forward when you get to the actual ruling part, obviously, and the logic of it is quite twisted. You know, uh basically it comes down to money essentially, doesn't it, really?

Matthew
52:33
It's not um Well it's it's it's a really strange game where you basically s like the best outcome is you have to buy every property and become the ultimate landlord. This is a game where a landlord saves the universe, which in this day and age just doesn't land as well.

Samuel
52:48
Yeah, absolutely. I I and I don't actually reject that criticism. I did think this felt rushed it not in the sense that the devs did a bad job but it was obviously made in two years very very fast for a fable game I but I still really love the um the setting I love that they did the kind of like um industrial revolution the setting and sort of take on the Fable Universe. I really like that. I didn't think it was uh I I I could see like what they were going for. Mollin, you made a big deal about how Fable two had too many progression systems, you know, a normal person couldn't pick it up and uh totally understand it and all this stuff, but uh it's true it loses a little bit of magic in that. But I suppose just as a kind of like uh still a a mood piece for the very specific feeling of fable and to have a slightly different uh visual twist on that universe. It was nice to step back into it, even if it's a more limited game. So yeah, uh I debated this one, uh Matthew. There's um uh a certain game directed by David Cage that was um jostling for a slot in these lower parts of my list but um lost out uh ultimately lost out. So um yeah Fable three ended up being one that's like I guess kind of a hard choice but I don't know not at all right.

Matthew
53:51
Yeah, I I probably sound more down on it than I am. Like it it's definitely it was in my twenty that I chopped down to ten. Mm. Yeah, exactly. Um I just think Yeah, that that recent experience, I don't know, I just s saw it in a slightly harsher light, I think, but um I just I don't know. I still I still prefer Fable to

Samuel
54:10
Yeah, completely fair, and so do I. Absolutely do as well. So um yeah. But it's just a shame that this is kind of the end of the road for um Fable already. And it's like we've barely gotten started. What a shame. So what's your uh number eight, Matthew? My number eight is Professor Leighton and the Lost Future. Okay. That's uh not on my list, so go ahead.

Matthew
54:29
Yeah, I mean Professor Leighton has appeared I think twice on my lists. I think we uh it appeared in the previous two. I'm a big fan of this series, uh level fives. sort of puzzle meets mystery story where the mystery story is sort of broken up with lots of little logic puzzles which you solve. Um This is like not a particularly like interesting evolution of this series in that they just got a bit better at making them with each one. Like the puzzles got a bit slicker, they ironed out what few problems they had, which was often slightly ambiguous wording of the puzzles themselves, which could throw you off when you were trying to solve them. You know, so a lot of it comes down to like the individual stories of the individual games, like do you like them? They're much of a much those they all sort of swim in the the same kind of like high 80s sort of review score kind of space. Um this has got a really fun time travel hook in that Professor Leighton and his sidekick Luke are visited uh or th or sent correspondence um from Luke ten years in the future. and are asked to come and help solve a mystery and so there's this big sort of time travel twist where in this sort of dark future Professor Leighton is now like a mafia boss. Um and there's all this sort of interesting stuff about Professor Leighton's backstory as well. Like, they're kind of um they're sort of con people sort of think of them as two kind of trilogies, um, the six late in games. So this is the end of the first trilogy. Um it doesn't like lean massively into what happened before, but it definitely pads out the latent character, you know, who I've said before is just sort of like A sausage in a hat really, that was not a lot to him. An uncooked sausage at that. But I love this. It ends as they all do with just a monstrously silly twist, which I really liked. But what what what I think why this is the best of the entire series is that uh it also has like a genuinely very affecting ending. Like there's there's something very poignant happens and the stuff with Professor Leighton's backstory is actually quite nicely handled and um I may even have shed a little tear at the end of it. It's a really yeah just a really sweet version of of of this setup Yeah, just a a really great super polished game from a a very happy period of Nintendo history.

Samuel
56:57
Oh great stuff. This is um It's really weird how Professor Leighton's not really in the culture now, as they say. It's like it's just sort of uh to discarded to like CX shelves, you know, that's kind of where it's at.

Matthew
57:10
The three DS games just weren't quite as good. Like they uh level five are in a bit of a weird place at any you know, they've kind of dropped the ball a little bit, which is so odd because when I was on mags they were just level five were just flying. Like outside of Nintendo, everyone every game they made was just zipping up the charts. They were in Japan they were as you know, about as successful as you could be and they were flying high and really pumping all that money back into productions they were getting ever more lavish. Um I I really hope they kinda come back 'cause I think they made some great games and I I I really liked um Hino who was the kind of guy who ran out. I never met him but uh, you know, on paper I really liked him and I really liked his sort of vibe and Um I've probably said on this pod before that I thought, you know, I used to think, oh, he he feels like he could have been an Iwata successor. 'Cause he had the same kind of sort of sort of business savvy but mixed with like creative eye in that he'd made games and had seemed to marry those two skills together brilliantly, but now they're like you know. What was the last good thing level five made? Nino Kuni 2, I guess?

Samuel
58:18
They yeah, they did make that, didn't they? Yeah. It's weird because I thought there was this is around the time that White Knight Chronicle came out, which is quite a boring, kinda like Pierce 3 RPG. Oh right, yeah. That should have been good. And I I never understood why they didn't just become like the open world RPG developer just because this seems to be the thing that they were kind of like gearing towards with Dragon Quest eight, for example, where you know that that was basically like a a very beautiful looking open world. So they could have been like quite a good match for this modern age, but they've always been into doing like loads of different stuff at once. And they doubled down on the y that Yukai Watch series, which uh I hear the games are okay, but like the I think as an anime it was like a big flop, like it lost 'em.

Matthew
59:00
Yeah, but it was i they they were big into like mass multimedia projects. Yeah. Like it it was always a game, a series, some toy, like They're trying to Pokemon everything basically.

Samuel
59:11
Yeah, it's just and that's not very interesting from a game's point of view. So um Yeah, I don't know. It's tough, but No, I'm glad to to hear it kind of emerge on your list.

Matthew
59:22
Leighton won't be appearing again. It's d it's downhill from here quite dramatically, I think.

Samuel
59:26
Until he appears to Phoenix Wright, I assume, in a future episode.

Matthew
59:28
Oh yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. That was his big comeback.

Samuel
59:31
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Okay, great stuff. So my number eight, Matthew, is Alan Wake. Is that on your list? It isn't on my list. Was very almost on my list. Yeah, I imagine it would have made the long list as well. So Obviously this is a remedy game. It took years and years to come out. It was originally announced as an open world game in I believe 2005, I think it was. And um I think it was originally set for PS3 and then it came out on um Xbox, Microsoft Published Game. So Remedy were obviously the creators of um Max Payne. I believe they sold Max Payne to Rockstar and Take Two and made a load of money, which gave them a long time to figure out what they wanted to do next. So They spent that time and money basically building an open world engine and then decided they didn't really want to make an open world in the end. Um they were kind of more into the guided narrative experience, which is what they're really good at. So they make this horror game that has like um a light and dark sort of mechanic, sort of like using uh torch or different lights to kind of like Take protection off of enemies and finishing them off with gunfire. Quite a straightforward mechanic. I would say combat is fairly repetitive in Alan Wake, because probably its biggest. uh sort of downfall. But the most interesting thing about it, of course, is the um the the main character is a Stephen King style author, writes his kind of horror books and kind of gets trapped in his own sort of story essentially. uh which is a very Stephen King sort of premise and is set in this very Twin Peaks like sort of location in Pacific Northwest. So all of that stuff, all of the character stuff um really elevates it and I think that Even though the combat is repetitive and you know runs out of steam a little bit, you are always you always want to keep going just because it's such a curious and interesting world to be in with such a like a strange main character. Uh would you say that's all fair, Matthew?

Matthew
01:01:06
Yeah, uh yeah, ab absolutely. I thought this uh mechanically I don't know if this game is necessarily like all that. Yeah, I think um Like it runs out of ideas quite quickly, but for its first couple of hours it's such an exciting mix of like narrative interruptions, weird characters. Cinematic set pieces, cool action that hasn't got boring yet. A great like the first two hours of Alan Wake are like absolutely brilliant. I think.

Samuel
01:01:32
Yeah.

Matthew
01:01:33
And then it's kind of it's still fine, but it i it I think that's why I didn't make my list. Is it it doesn't ever quite escalate on the action side of things in the way that it maybe needed to.

Samuel
01:01:44
Yeah, I think that uh if anything the um small spin-off they released afterwards the small sequel American uh nightmare I think it was and that has a lot more going on combat wise. It's more of a combat game and it's more more functional as a combat game. Uh better at it. This I think like um what I think helps with the Alan Wake is its use of like signature remedy touches. So uh it's structured like a T V show. You know, it has like um you know the kind of cliffhangers and and stuff like that. That's how the chapters are divided up essentially. And they really leaned into that in the marketing and it's a bit pretentious, but you know, it I think it worked because no one else is really doing anything like it. And obviously Remedy is big into like um illusion and sort of they have their own kind of like oddball touches like the band Poets of the Fall who I believe are the lead singer is a friend of Sam Lake's and that's why Poets of the Fall is so closely associated with Remedies games, so in Max Payne 2. They're in this is the fictional band The Old Gods of Asgard and um they create music within the game. But you've got that mixed in there which gives it a lot of personality, along with the fact that Remedy makes these um you know music choices like Roy Orbison Depeche mode that play at the end of the chapters in the in the game. That just gives it such a like flavour that you just didn't get from blockbuster games at the time. And I think that that's why so many kind of critics of my generation get excited about Remedy, because they're just you know, if they can nail the game side of it, they're they're already really good at the the storytelling and like um characterful nature of their games, you know?

Matthew
01:03:12
How do you feel about the expanded remedy universe or whatever it is.

Samuel
01:03:17
Well, I mean the rumor is that they're working on Owl Make two, right, for epic games. Yeah. I think that's Uh I'm perfectly fine with them kind of like revisiting it. I think it could be um uh you know it's uh it's really easy to see how a sequel could be better with improved combat and s.

Matthew
01:03:31
and such and like control has quite a lot going on combat wise with like a lot of different I thought I thought control was like m out outside of max pain one and two like there's their kind of gameplay wise, their most sort of satisfying thing they'd made.

Samuel
01:03:44
Definitely, yeah. I think they they just thought r really long and hard about how to nail that side of things and not just the story and setting side of things. So, you know, the setting in that game is obviously very um you know, very notable. And I like that they have so much affection for Alan Wake after all these years. You know, he's like it seemed like this game just sold badly in the wake of, you know, another game that'll be further up my list. It came out at almost exactly the same time. But um Interest in it has endured and I think that comes down to the the writing the characters and those all of those cool touches, you know?

Matthew
01:04:11
Yeah. I would like to see. what an a more open world version of a remedy game looks like. You know, I I I quite like the I think they could take quite a good swing at the the w is it the wide linear that they call it, the kind of un you know, the almost like the sort of uncharted or naughty dog. kind of sort of sandbox stuff where they have like big levels where you sort of discover story at your own pace. I think that's something I think Remedy could do something really interesting with because they basically make quite quite beautiful corridors, you know. Yeah. Uh up until kind of control. You know, it's it's it's a really linear path through a level which kind of looks like it should be more open, but The idea of driving around that environment and discovering interesting things could be could be quite cool. Yeah.

Samuel
01:04:55
I think so. I I think one thing I do like about this game is that The way they used uh I think they told me this in the interview at the time was um the way they used their open world tech was they could show you an enemy who's miles away, who you know you'll encounter in like two minutes, and there's kind of like the build-up to that. Like if the camera would zoom in. And then cut back again. And that was all designed because the draw distance for an open world was, you know, r necessary that the game could actually do that. But instead they used it for like, you know, setting up an encounter and making things more tense. That kind of technique. Oh that's interesting. Yeah, yeah, it is interesting. I think it does work a few times in this game. But I agree with you. I mean, you know, I I I love the games Remedy makes and um that sounds like they're working on quite a lot of stuff, so uh we'll see we'll see how it pans out. But um Yeah, so what's your number seven Matthew?

Matthew
01:05:39
This one I think i I'm looking at it I'm like well this is actually too low. Um it's Mass Effect two.

Samuel
01:05:45
Yep, that's her on my list.

Matthew
01:05:46
Probably no surprise.

Samuel
01:05:48
What's your number seven? Uh Fallout New Vegas. Not on my list. Okay, interesting. So Now this is a head choice because this isn't actually a heart choice. It actually took a bit of effort for me to put this on my list because I thought there's no world in which I can say Final Fantasy XIII's a better game than New Vegas. It's simply not what people believe. And I think that I kind of know in my heart of hearts that that's true too. So there's a big tension in I saw this on PC Gamer all the time. Where all commenters wanted to do was tell you how Bethesda's Fallout games were not proper Fallout games, but Fallout New Vegas was a proper Fallout game. It was like the worst thing in the universe. Please just shut up and get on with your lives. That's how I felt about it. I love Fallout 3 and I think it's a more complete game than New Vegas is. Obviously made by Obsidian. A couple years after Fallout 3, I love the idea of farming out you know, um s a sort of like follow up game, not quite a sequel to uh a developer that's got the expertise to make it. What a cool thing. I would love to have had another um Obsidian Fallout game in between. Came out in quite a like a bumpy state. Uh there was like a big argument about Metacritic at the time. None of that is very interesting in retrospect. The New Vegas side of things was it was kind of like what people love about it is how malleable the story was and how much you could like make choices that actually informed the course. the game so turning factions against each other and just being generally reckless and seeing how the game kind of copes with it and the game coped with it pretty well. So when I played this, I actually only played this about three or four years ago. Whacked on a load of like visual mods. You can make this game look fucking amazing on PC. Which is nice. And basically just tried to turn every single faction against me and each other. And at one point a character in the game was like, but if you've also betrayed them, then they'll just want to attack Oh, oh, okay. And like the game was reacting in real time to all the bullshit I'd been doing. To like crossing Caesars Legion and then the different the other different factions of the game. I was just there thinking, okay, fine, if I can piss everyone off, what let's just do this and see what happens. And the game was like actually reacting to it. So I I think that's core to the magic of why people like this, along with the fact that the flavour of the early Fallout games, people thought Bethesda had lost a bit. Now that I can kind of I can kind of agree with. There was like a dark sense of humor to the early Fallout games. 3. Fallout 3 is not really about that. This brings a little bit more of the nasty side of Fallout Back, I would say. And um for that I kind of understand it. I would say the reason I don't like it as much as three is the world is not nearly as fun to explore When you get to the Vegas strip, it kind of looks more like Fallout Bogner Regis. You know, that's just down to like the limitations of what the hardware can do. You can only make Vegas look so good. But I absolutely respect this as like a solid RPG of the time. And what a treat to have another Fallout game two years after the um after Fallout 3. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
01:08:34
Yeah, I mean I I I agree with all of that. I mean the reason it's not on my list is that in recent years I've fallen out a little bit with the kind of not the faller, I think specifically like the obs like the obsidian style of RPGs, like what they value, I don't know that I value. Um I think this came out of playing um the outer worlds where again like they were priding themselves like I think they were trying to m draw a lot of kind of connective tissue to New Vegas with that. in in terms of like whatever character you build and whatever decisions you make, you know, we want that to be reflected properly in the game. And maybe this is just gonna sound really contrarian and doesn't make any sense. But when I'm playing a game which is bending over backwards to accommodate everyone, I feel like nothing is special. I feel like every decision is actually kind of meaningless because the game is is so elastic. that it fits me. Like I actually don't mind the that they seem very averse to someone seeing something and not being able to access it or not be able to have anything, you know. They fe everyone needs to feel special. And I'm okay not feeling special if it means they're like the like the peaks are that much higher. And F I will say for me, like a lot of obsidian stuff, and I get this in New Vegas too, I actually don't respond as positively to like how many consequences there are because I I it just makes the whole thing feel a bit false to me. I don't know if that makes any sense.

Samuel
01:10:12
I I see why the why a certain type of hardcore player responds to the to this type of game because it's a role-playing game, you want to inhabit the role and in theory throwing your toys out of the pram allows you to do that because you are you have been empowered as a player to be able to to do that. And I I I respect that point of view and why people believe that. But I don't think it's all there is to an RPG. And I agree with you. I think the the big moments in Fallout 3 I found really effective. And so, you know, I don't think I don't think that I guess I I I guess like you I value those big moments over that malleability.

Matthew
01:10:47
Yeah, I I think I'm I'm interested in I'm interested in in ch in when it comes to choices and consequences. choices. I'm interested in in games which let you you know th they give everyone the big problem and you have all the choices to make and the interesting thing is the act of deciding what you're gonna do, not whether I've bought a particular character. To the mix who can do X, Y, or Z. I'm not interested in choices that only my character can do. I'm interested in difficult choices where I can pick any of the answers. It's the difference between Bioware and Uh well the difference at least between Mass Effect I'd say and like New Vegas in like Mass Effect is these big universe defining moral dilemmas where Okay, you only get three choices maybe, but everyone can make those three choices and they're all kind of interesting. Where here it's like, well, for every situation we've got like a hundred different things can happen, and you're like, Well, yes, but I you know, I don't ni I don't need that. I'd rather have less good stuff. Fewer options that are better. Yeah. No, I can kinda see that. Yeah, for sure. But that's I don't know. I That isn't the that isn't the narrative around New Vegas. Like why it is so celebrated now is like, you know, there are loads of big massive video essays on YouTube where they're like Just take this one mission and and see how malleable it is and see how cleverly it kind of adapts to every character and it's like it's okay to feel like you didn't get something. Because it makes the things you do get feel more special.

Samuel
01:12:18
Yeah. I feel. I think that's well put, yeah. And that's you know, I I could see why someone would have this higher up on their list. It's like, you know, if this is seen as the Fallout Players Fallout game, that's completely fine with me. I think that's a good th I I drew limited joy from the um the main questline in this game. Whereas I thought the main questline in Fallout 3 was just a really good breadcrumb trail and fascinating and Took you to some really cool stuff. I mean, again, I I I like New Vegas a lot. I haven't played it as much as Fallout 3. I don't think I've done every single quest in it. So perhaps, you know. My take isn't like the most qualified compared to some of the other games on my list. It's not like you know, I've it's not like I've played it twenty times or whatever. Yeah, I think uh I I definitely respected what it was trying to do and, you know, absolutely rate it as one of the best games of this year. So um Yeah, that's what I'm at. Also think that the outer world showed that maybe people were um d I don't know, like uh it was quite interesting seeing a bit of a lukewarm response to that. I couldn't tell if people had just uh maybe built up the reputation of this game too much or if maybe that That game on its own terms wasn't giving people what they wanted exactly. It was hard to weigh up.

Matthew
01:13:19
We did a playthrough of that on the on the Rock Paper Shotgun YouTube channel where i they made this big thing of like you can kill anyone so we made the decision like we were gonna kill as many people as possible and make every bad decision and it's like yes the game technically works but it's also boring as hell so congratulations you know What what an achievement. Because they had to bend over sp backwards to make it work and you were like, Well what's the point? You've created this miserable, unsatisfying playstyle. Like just don't include it. Yeah. Don't include it and this would be a better more interesting game. Eh.

Samuel
01:13:51
Maybe we you know Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, well that's uh good chat though, Matthew. I enjoyed uh discussing that a little bit. So what's your number six? My number six is Infinite Space. Oh, that was one of my honourable mentions. So I'm I'm shocked to see it this high, but excited to hear your take on it.

Matthew
01:14:05
I love Infinite Space. I feel like I'm Infinite Space kind of number one UK games journalist cheerleader. Yeah, I I th I thought this was just a a fantastic mix of kind of sort of characterful sort of sci-fi visual novel as you walk around s you trip you know, go around space meeting all these interesting characters, uh, meets really compelling and deep. um Space Battles made by Platinum Games uh in collaboration with Nude Maker directed by Hifumi Kono who is Mr Steel Battalion. aka that game with that mad controller with all the buttons. I think there is a through line from Steel Battalion to this, weirdly, in terms of Really delivering on like the fantasy of something in a big way. In there it was Mechs, here it's spaceships and building a spaceship. and kind of command uh commanding a kind of space armada. What's really interesting about Infinite Space is it has this very simple rock, paper, scissor battle system. That is greatly influenced by the very specific ships you bring into it. It has quite a simple setup in terms of how battles control. It's not like Steel Battalion, like there's only like three buttons on screen or something So it it looks it's very easy to kind of like actually manipulate, but the very specific spaceships you bring in, like their behavior really alters where they fit into the rock paper shotgun uh rock paper scissors. Um cell phone. That's really thrown me. Uh that it it really uh Yeah, that it it really influences like how you use the rock paper scissors system. So like, you know, you can build something. You can You can literally build like a glass cannon, you know, where ev the whole ship is geared to just like bringing things down in a couple of like incredible shots, but if they don't do it, they are fucked. Or you can build just like this absolute like just beast that can absorb shots and just whittle people down. You can make a ship which is actually all about being like having so many crew members on board that you can just flood um rival ships. with like infiltration squads and you can do it just because you've got the manpower, but the nature of those ships and y they can't be all things. Like you really have to dedicate the design to one thing and Ships are built like using this sort of like uh almost like Resident Evil inventory system, like you have a fixed grid and you're slotting rooms onto the ship. So you can really build any combination of of facilities. and sort of statistical strengths and weaknesses that you want. And I was just amazed at how much character each ship had and how it came through in combat. I I thought this on paper not my jam at all. I I am not into like hard sci-fi, I'm not into kind of spaceships and and I'm not like into like naval strategy and that kind of stuff, you know. Whenever spaceships are having fights in Star Trek I'm super bored. But here, like, I just felt my decisions echoing through this simple battle system. I think it is s sublime as an RPG. I love this game. I will say it is fucking hard as nails and it's really easy to screw yourself over. So you basically have to learn to play it with very clever a lot of save basically save scumming.

Samuel
01:17:36
to get through it, which is a big downside, and I think a lot of people bounced off that, but if it does click, oh boy, this is a great game. Hmm. Yeah, so um I sh I must confess, Matthew, when I said shocked, I think I uh realised I thought you meant Infinity Blade on iOS, which is in my own remote. Um I'm not shocked by this at all, of course, because we talked about that in a previous episode. Um so I thought Jesus, Matthew put this swipe on the screen sword combat game. Um that's just because I've had five hours sleep. So um good, good content there. Yeah, so this is um obviously one of the games that comes out of the platinum sort of deal. It's so it's one I'm like not mega experienced with, but I th I think that goes for most people. Well I was just looking on eBay and there are copies setting for like uh you won't ever get this for the retail price now basically. It's you know unsurprisingly a kind of cult favourite. But I love the look of it in screenshots and stuff. It's always been one I've intended to play. And like I just love the idea that, you know, basically every other game that comes out of that platinum deal is like an action game that's vaguely in the mold of, you know, Devil May Cry or You know, there's stuff Clover Studio was well well known for. And then there's this very strange DS only thing that will probably never release again in any other form. And it's a hardcore spaceship game on DS. I just think that's um That's a rad thing to exist.

Matthew
01:18:54
It has I will say it's got like a vital bit of platinum DNA in it, in that like that it's very funny. There's like quite characterful, like weird enemy designs. You know, there are a lot of quite dry, boring looking spaceships, but there's also like a disco Death Star that you have to fight and things like that. And it it sort of has without kind of spoiling the story, it has this sort of um it sort of hit it sort of flips a little bit in into the game and like It starts off as it's quite silly sort of space opera and ends up being a bit more like sort of sort of profound 2001. It's quite it's quite an interesting mix. Like it's got this very two clear kind of phases to it. Yeah, it's just it's really, really hard. I think it's it's it it's interesting 'cause I think he in Arbor basically wanted to make it cause he produced Steel Battalion and was like Platinum should be doing this. So he kind of brings he brings in the director and I'm glad that they did make it. There was no coverage of this. They did like no previews for this game at all. Right. Like I think the first time we ever saw it, it just turned up as a review cart. I started tinkering away with it and was like, holy shit, I think this is actually amazing. uh and then like everyone else gave it like seven.

Samuel
01:20:07
Yeah, I mean this is like an absolutely fucking heavyweight year for platinum, obviously, as we'll get into. I'm sure a little bit more down the line. But um what a what a cool thing. Yeah, I can just I just know from the way you've described it that a certain type of our lista, Matthew, will be going onto eBay now and figuring out how on earth they can get their hands on this.

Matthew
01:20:26
Just to save a lot is all I'll say or you're gonna have a rough time.

Samuel
01:20:30
Yeah, expect to pay like if you want a new copy, I c I just saw one for like seventy quid, so um that's where we're at. But um obviously we know there are basically gangsters out there at the moment trying to like goose the price

Matthew
01:20:39
of Prion games so yeah it's me on this podcast.

Samuel
01:20:42
Yeah.

Matthew
01:20:43
I've only included it because I've got ten copies I want to sell.

Samuel
01:20:46
Yeah the Matthew Castle cartel is um is in full swing. Um okay cool. So Matthew, what uh that was your number seven? Six. Six. Right, okay, cool. Yep. So Ralph to my number six, which is Vanquish on Xbox 360 and PS3. Is this on your list? This isn't on my list. Yeah, so I thought when you have Bayonetta lower down, I thought, well, he probably doesn't have Vanquish on his list then. Because I think both of us will probably agree that Bayonetta is the um superior game. So nonetheless, this is an excellent um third-person shooter um directed by Shinji Mikami, made by Platinum Games, part of their Sega Deal like Infinite Space Wars and Bayonetta. This was uh sort of like widely anticipated by my peers, but kind of ignored by um the larger sort of like audience for Blockbuster games. I had a bit of chip on my shoulder about the fact that so many people played Gears of War but no one gave a shit about this. I was like, if you play Gears of War but not this, you have no taste and like these days I don't care because, you know, I'm in my thirties and I've got better things to worry about. But Yeah, Vanquish basically like brings a spin on this where you are incredibly mobile while you're doing third-person cover shooting. So you're like in this kind of suit that basically hit lets you kind of rocket around on your knees shooting enemies and pausing for slow-mo and performing kind of like physical uh sort of like attacks as well at high speed. And basically just bringing a lot more momentum to a genre that become a bit too much, a bit too staid and uh stay behind cover until everyone's been popped in the head, basically. And this was like a kind of mega arcadey, exciting approach to to that sort of thing. I would say that one area where it doesn't shine for me versus Platinum's other games is I don't think it's got much of a personality. People might disagree with this.

Matthew
01:22:28
But no, that's that's kind of why it doesn't make my list. Like mechanically Beautiful but I find it quite a hard game to like love outright.

Samuel
01:22:36
Yeah. And I think that's completely fair. Like I think you play something like Resident Evil 4 and you're like, oh okay, well, you know, a Mikami sort of like shooter will surely have a bit of this kind of like flavor that just The the the it's not like super essential to enjoy the game, but uh kind of like it's the sort of thing that cements it in your memory. And it doesn't have that, it has this very boring kind of like um Hillary Clinton-esque kind of uh president figure and Some terrorists, some I don't really remember it. Your main character's kind of a dud. But yeah, but just in terms of like a combat game, as a kind of like Japanese spin on what had become a very kind of Western dominated genre was Rad. And it did look amazing. And it's really cool that you can play this on PC now. It's 60 frames. I'm glad that that happened. That happened a few years ago. So yeah, Vanquish, Matthew. Any thoughts?

Matthew
01:23:18
Yeah, I I b uh basically with you, Ian, yeah, like I say, didn't didn't quite make the list for me, but yeah, like a really beautiful thing, like Mikami just knows game feel and gets game feel in a way that very few others do. Fab stuff.

Samuel
01:23:34
Yeah, absolutely. Just um yeah, very sophisticated third person shooter and um just a a lot more fun than its contemporaries were.

Matthew
01:23:40
So I swear I've heard some like interesting stories from Rich Stanton. about the press trip for this. Um I think Rich is is coming up on an upcoming episode. We'll definitely grill in for that. Yeah. I think there was some I s someone asked some very sort of like So hopefully we can dig into that in a future episode.

Samuel
01:24:04
Yep, I'm sure that will that podcast is gonna end up being forty minutes of Metal Gear Solid 2 chatter then like two hours of um Rich telling us stories I'm sure, but um that should be good. So what's your number five, Matthew?

Matthew
01:24:14
Well, this seems a bit gross considering like Bayonetta's so low and Vanquish isn't on my list and this is a big heart choice. Number five, I've actually got Castlevania Lords of Shadow.

Samuel
01:24:24
Oh yeah, didn't make my list, but not really one I played to be honest.

Matthew
01:24:27
Kind of passing by.

Samuel
01:24:28
Oh my god, I love this game.

Matthew
01:24:29
I'd say this is my favourite of the of those kind of like hack and s hack and slash kind of God of Warri clones. I I'd probably prefer this over like any particular God of War. Mmm. Maybe bar the PS4 one. Yeah. Which is just so different. Yeah, big kind of Castlevania reboots. Uh what's interesting about this is that Obviously Castlevania had been like ruling the roost as as the a sort of 2D Metroidvania. And this c sort of goes back more to the sort of Nez and Snez games in that it's a s you know, it's a very linear progression. through a ser series of themed levels, but obviously like punched up and pumped up with kind of this generation sort of visual juice. Gorgeous game. Mercury Steam made it. Amazing art design. Like it's often likened to the kind of Guillermo del Toro's sort of fantasy films. That might just be a lazy They're a Spanish studio kind of connection, but it it's got big Pan's labyrinth energy in places. One of my favourite kind of s sort of games for a sort of sense of progression in that you start out in these tiny little villages and there's this idea of like, you know, Dracula's castle, this huge thing you're working towards. you catch glimpses of it in other levels and there's this real sense of making your way towards it despite it being this kind of linear succession of levels. You know, it's it's got a such an amazing sense of world and kind of coherence. for not an open world game. I really love that about it. It really leans into kind of like trope, kind of like spooky witch's house and the creepy old castle. You know, there are smaller castles before you reach the big castle. When you finally get there, it's just like, holy shit, this place looks amazing. Looks absolutely massive. Um great sense of cinematic style. I love the action. You've got this um it's it's kind of like this chain whip, but it it really sells you on like la like the l the momentum and the violence of like lashing something. And he like builds up momentum. It's really heavy and slow but powerful. It's got a great feel. It's not like God of War is so fast, it's like butter, it's like no sense of weight to a lot of God of War I feel, 'cause it's so quick and and super zippy where this is like a bit a bit slower a bit heavier like its hero and really sells you on that uh great bosses It's got a couple of like Shadow of Colossus style, kind of climb the boss to kind of kill it things. And it cribs from all over the place, but in really fun ways. I never really understood what the Kajima connection was. 'Cause it was like produced or executive produced by Kojima and they threw his name around a lot. Yeah. Bit cynical. Yeah, I mean outside of it having like a celebrity cast which feels a bit Kajima-y. in terms of like, you know, it's got Patrick Stewart and Jason Isaacs and in Robert Carlisle, you know, it's got a slightly weird cast. In you know, it feels like the kind of weirdo actors that Kajim would also sort of be into, particularly Robert Carlisle. Um it's like It's not really a name you'd put on a poster of anything at that time. Yeah, I just tr uh you know, I reviewed this and didn't really know much about it, hadn't been following it and was just bowled over by how much I l I like of it. And it maybe it's amplified in my head because of that surprise factor. That sometimes happens when you're reviewing games. You know you're like Oh wow, this is actually really good. And maybe you think it's a bit better than it actually is, but I have replayed it since uh on PC where it's got obviously a much nicer frame rate. and is super gorgeous. Just a big lush, crazy production uh values in this game.

Samuel
01:28:10
Yeah, just great. Yeah, so I don't have like loads of sympathy for uh this time when it comes to like publishers who farmed out series to the Western developers and they obviously did a shit job. And like just loads of duds came out of that initiative and it seemed very cynical and I just thought, well, the reason people like these series is because they had a specific mix of like influences and uh a flavor that they that that really worked for them. And so to strip that out it becomes quite an anodyne sort of cover version. But on the flip side of that, it's when developers get it really, really right. Like um, you know, obviously uh Ninja Theory did with DMC. And yeah, and this obviously is another sort of successful example of the time. There's almost a bummer that doesn't lead on to like bigger and better things for Mercury Steam. There's that second one. And then they kind of fit in like um making Metroid Vadius for Nintendo. I don't know a lot else. I think they've done some other stuff, but I'm not that familiar with it.

Matthew
01:29:03
They've got a kind of games or service thing called Oh, not Steam Lords, something like that. Yeah. Yeah, they they they have this sort of games of servicey thing which they own themselves that they're making, which they seem to still be like pottering away on. But that yeah, and then doing this kind of contract work for Nintendo. Some people are super down on Mercury Steam, like they don't rate anything they've done and they especially don't rate their Metroid games. I I liked I really liked the 3DS Metroid game. I'm really excited for the the dread as well. So Yeah, I I I rate this team. Lords of Shadow Two is like uh it's got a couple of really great things, a couple of great boss fights, some lovely art design, but it is very balked in in in a lot of ways made me about as angry as I've been when I was playing a review game. with this terrible stealth section. Yeah, but this one I just thought real good. Real good. I think it's got a bit of a cult following, you know. It just feels maybe a bit gross to put it above Palatinum's games because they are They're just so definitive as like action experiences and so much more sophisticated and accomplished. Yeah. But I I like the world of Castlevania. I like that it's set in the Castlevania thing. I d I I just it it feels like a very complete package to me and yeah, mega heart choice.

Samuel
01:30:23
Mm, yeah, this is a a CEX purchase for me that has remained on my sh shelf for uh ten years. So uh yeah. But um I'm glad I'm here glad to hear it on your list. It's yeah, it's still a game I don't know much about. I'm I played it briefly. I was a bit confused by the level structure of it. I did think it it was going to be a game in a big castle, but like you say that comes later. So uh yeah. Yeah it's odd. Uh-huh. Okay, great stuff. So my number five Matthew is Bioshock 2. Not on my list. Did it make your long list at all?

Matthew
01:30:48
Yeah. I I don't think it uh yeah, I don't think it ever troubled the top ten. That's fair enough. I'll kinda hit you with the wildest hot take. Okay, go on I wonder if I wonder if Bioshock 2 is a little the people who say Bioshock 2 is the better one are are a bit like the people that say Alien 3 is the best one.

Samuel
01:31:12
But I don't think it's like I think it's a better combat game than the first Bioshock, but I don't think it like it's able to club you over the head with the sort of like wow look at this world building in the way that that one was It was kind of like it's not not an expansion pack. It doesn't feel like that. But it does feel like not entirely a full sequel. Which I think is completely fine. It was made in a very short space of time. Bunch of uh the Rational devs went off 2K Boston devs went off and formed a new studio, 2K Marin, and made this in you know a pretty short space of time. Uh you play a big daddy in the game. It it introduces uh Sophia Lamb, a kind of like a rival to Andrew Ryan who wasn't in the first game, so you have that kind of narrative pill to swallow. She's got like different philosophies and stuff. And um generally speaking, you're it feels like it's a reflection of the first Bioshock in some ways. Like you meet certain types of characters where you're like, well, who's gonna be the Atlas figure who betrays me here? And what's gonna be the big moment? And the game kind of like does some quite interesting things with that. It's not it's not really a twist-filled game. Sometimes the twist is the fact that there isn't a twist. I would say in this game. But to be honest though, Matthew, like the story side of it is not really why I dug this. It was the fact that you got to see more of Rapture. And the fact that playing as a Big Daddy meant you got to see some of Rapture Underwater, which was really effective. And I think this is a really good example of like an immersive sim type game, a systemsy game, where you play a tank rather than like a stealth character. So much of this game is about like, you know, hacking one of those like flying drone things, the little turret things. Um, setting up your little turrets, putting down like rivet traps. There are like a few occasions where there's just an absolute rush of enemies and it's about preparing for the fight. And because you're more of a powerhouse than you were in the first game, going around clubbing people with a wrench, because you've got like a drill arm and a rivet gun. You just feel much more of a badass. And I think that that was a a transformative approach to the combat. I mean at the time I really liked it. I reviewed it and I gave it a nine for um X360 magazine. And I think that maybe, you know, you could argue it comes up short in the narrative aspect in terms of like it ha it's not, you know, it can never reach the heights of the first game. But that was always going to be a tough s a tough thing to do anyway But I think it's a more a less uneven game than Infinite would end up being. And it showed there was more life left in Rapture. What are your thoughts?

Matthew
01:33:27
Yeah, I I I th I I think for me like the the big hurdle this game never got over was that I I don't think you can experience like Rapture will never have the same impact the second time round that it had the first. Like is such an a ma like that is such a sort of generation defining bit of world building for me that I felt like, okay, more of this. And I l I love that that point you make about the like ac like an action focus of Mercy Sin. I think that's that's like uh uh really elegantly put. I just I just don't like the feel of the action enough in this world. Like, you know, on paper, yes, it's much more sophisticated. And you know, it does more interesting thing with the powers and you have those, like you say, the kind of preparation phase before the attack. But fundament fundamentally like these games they're not they're not particularly nice game feel games um I don't think and because of that that bigger focus I don't know puts that into sort of exposes that a bit more, I guess. Yeah, I do like I'd probably be like it's it's by no means as bad as Alien 3 It just I I just feel like the take is like, oh oh this is better than the first. And I just don't feel that way at all. Yeah. I think that I think I prefer the areas of rapture I do prefer the areas of rapture you see in the first one. I think it has a bigger impact. I think bar the the very last like hour, two hour stretch, I prefer the general journey through that world. I'm just not as interested in being a big daddy. It's still great. I really, really enjoyed it. I think it's just been elevated a bit more than I would. elevate it myself. Like I I probably prefer infinite to this.

Samuel
01:35:07
Yeah, I think that as in world building I absolutely prefer infinite to this. I think that uh combat wise, I don't know, there's probably not loads in it. I don't know, I don't know.

Matthew
01:35:18
It's never a series which isn't like nailed nailed combat, I would say.

Samuel
01:35:21
No, I thought I thought the combat was better in this one though. I think that it I think it was a slightly more refined in feel and the fact that you weren't as dependent on I would say not very good stealth systems. in the first Bioshock and like quite weedy attacks and dying and coming back in the Vita tube. Like I just the rhythm of that I thought web wore me down a little bit when I replayed um the original Bioshock a few years ago. Caveat though, I have not replayed this. I ha I did play the um uh Minerva's Den DLC, the story DLC they did for this about about four years after release, and did still enjoy it. You know, it's not one that's in my recent memory, for example. But as a kind of like a a choice from this year, a game that I really, really dug. Um I have no problem putting it here. And I just I thought the Big Sister was kind of interesting too. This kind of like figure who would a figure of chaos who would turn up and um mostly for a quite a low stakes scrap and then but then but occasionally just like you know, crack open a sort of like a piece of glass and then water would pour in and then you're suddenly like walking among like sea life and stuff and That was a little bit different to the first game.

Matthew
01:36:23
Yeah, it's such a great world. Like it's it can eas it could have easily sustained like even more stories than it did and more visits, I think. Yeah, I d uh I'm not really knocking it. That's fair enough, yeah. So what's your number four, Matthew? Uh my number four is Red Dead Redemption.

Samuel
01:36:38
That's higher on my list. Uh my number four is Halo Reach. Not on my list. Well not on your list? Okay, fair enough. Um so yeah, this is I think the most a consistent Halo campaign. It has no total dud missions. It doesn't reach the heights of Halo 3. It has nothing like the two scarabs fight. But it does have some high points for sure. I think that so much of what I love about this game comes down to the campaign and the sort of context you're in of a planet that is like slowly collapsing into total disaster. The the feeling of dread that builds up. It's really really good at making every success in in the game, in the campaign, uh feel small within the context of this catastrophic failure that's going on around you. I think the story is great or bad, depending on how you look at it. The characters are paper thin, the dialogue isn't very good, but it's really about the feel of the world. is just so powerful. Just the feeling that like you're watching a tragedy play out. I think that I've replayed this multiple times in recent years, and I think there's a a few highlights that really that really speak to this. Most notably is the mission where you're flying between skyscrapers in the city while it's being quote unquote glass, which is like a halo term for aliens destroying big cities basically. uh with laser guns. And um the city is like on fire, but over the course of the mission it becomes more and more on fire and like more and more desperate and and it's just I was amazed that Halo could do something like that that could make make the feel of the world land like that. Cause I never felt that way about the other Halo games. I've never cared about the story. But I think this just does such a great job of just making it feel like you cannot do anything to stop this. This is going to happen to you around you. And at best, you can just try and fight it and try and hold it off and try and get. Try and save some people, some lives, but millions of people are going to die here and it's gonna be grim as fuck. And I think it really conveys that well. What are your thoughts, Matthew?

Matthew
01:38:35
Yeah, I mean, I think I probably need to replay this. Uh you know, I played this when it came out and went, Yep, that's more Halo and then never really thought on it again. I like the end of it. I think its story actually you're right, does definitely landed m more for me than the other stories. that they've told. Um I don't have the natural like affinity for like Halo that a lot of my peers, including you, have I feel. So it would take an awful lot for this to sort of punch through into my all-time list. It ha did it handle slightly differently.

Samuel
01:39:05
Didn't it have like iron sights? I uh I think it has a few different things. Like it gives you the ability to run as like an ability. You get these powers. Yeah, the case. Iron sights don't remember even though I've played it recently. I certainly wasn't using the iron sights clearly.

Matthew
01:39:18
Yeah, the cha I yeah, I I I clicked with this sort of mechanically, but I can't really sort of elegantly put what those differences are 'cause it's just been so long. It's got the flying around in space bit, that's good.

Samuel
01:39:28
Yeah, bit a little bit of Star Fox in the middle there, just to pepper it through. That was on the um during in the E3 presentation, I was there. Yeah, that's right. This mission's only like uh about fifteen minutes long and then the rest of the game is on foot, you know.

Matthew
01:39:40
But ep yeah, huge epic scale bungee were arguably only getting better at making those games. Kind of a shame that we never got to see what else would happen. Yeah, I mean in hindsight, maybe it is the highlight of it all.

Samuel
01:39:52
I don't know, it's sort of um it's up and down. Like I mean I I must confess this is one I don't have as much experience with the multiplayer and I know that a lot of people got big into the Halo Reach. multiplayer and that latter day sort of sophistication of Halo probably resulted in a better multiplayer experience and then that carries over to Halo 4 and 5 which are obviously very good multiplayer games. So I miss that side of it. But this as a you know, I I treat Halo as a bit of a campaign series, I guess. Um knowing the multiplayer is good So yeah, I think I th I really dig reach. But yeah, I think it's worth it.

Matthew
01:40:22
Go back and replay that thing you're talking about with the city. That sounded cool. Like they they didn't I I don't really remember much about it apart from the bit in space and the end. So um yeah, I should go back. That sounds I wanna see that.

Samuel
01:40:33
Yeah, it probably helps that the the Master Chief collection of the games that haven't been like remastered, this comes off the best. Um probably because it's more recent. That's just unfound Halo 4, which still looks really good. But uh yeah, yeah. It's um I really dig it. I think for a lot of people this is the Halo story they wanted to see told in the games. And Bungie did a great job of it. Like you say, the the the kind of like last stand element to the story at the end, which they may or may not have cribbed from Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII, I don't know, but it's obviously that kind of like butch casty kind of ending, isn't it really? It's um go out fighting or Blackadder goes forth. Uh your mileage may fairy. But uh yeah, Halo Reach Matthew. So we're up to your number three, right?

Matthew
01:41:11
I hope this list doesn't sound too contrarian just because all these classics you've got are higher.

Samuel
01:41:16
No no, I mean I I just this really demonstrates what different tracks we're on, I think, this list. Yeah. Like it just and also I think I I I I really I actually really dig your list. I think your your choices are really good. And I I like having the difference. So uh yeah, go ahead.

Matthew
01:41:29
We've got another DS game. We've got 9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors. The first of the Zero Escape series made by Chunsoft, written and directed by Kataro. Uchikoshi, these are visual novels for the most part with branching storylines and difficult decisions to make which result in sticky ends for lots of people. But it's also broken up with escape room segments where you look around rooms and solve puzzles. Kind of like miniature kind of contained point and click games. I think people know what escape room games are like. There was like a big craze for them like twenty years ago, like flash versions of these. Um like Crimson R think it was Crimson Room, maybe? Yeah, so you know, it's like a big burst of sort of lots of sort of static dialogue and story, but then broken up with these quite engaging kind of like maybe they take you I don't know between half an hour and an hour maybe um pointy point and click sections which I think kind of break it up and give the game a a bit more kind of variety than just the straight visual novel. So it's a very good gateway drug to that genre. It's also like a fantastically kind of pulpy, twisty, satisfying thriller. uh the characters awake on a ship they've been locked into a game called the Nunnery game where which basically involves these sort of weird bracelets um and a lot of strange arcane rules about which combinations of people can open doors on the ship and they're trying trying to escape. Um like I say, most things you try, you end up dead. And then you jump back in the story flow chart, 'cause it's presented as a big flow chart, and um start making different decisions and branching it out in different ways. Without spoiling it, what's great about this game and the Zero Escape series in general is that there is a mechanical and narrative justification for the structure of like a choose your own adventure, which is really interesting and just sells the whole thing a lot better. You know, it doesn't feel arbitrary, it doesn't feel like you're just replaying it for the sake of because it's a visual novel and that's what you do. Um it's a great like sort of sci-fi meet sort of sore type thriller. Twisted game but with a sort of interesting sci-fi back to it. Um It also sets you on the path for enjoying the next two um Virtue's Last Reward and the other one who which name I've s I've forgotten. Oh yeah. I can't remember what the last part's called. That's embarrassing. But uh anyway, a trilogy which is very much a big continuation and you need to play them all in order. Very twisty, they only get more satisfying. This one A really great place to start. It's on DS, it's on PC. I think you can play it on iOS as well, though. That might just be the visual novel portions of the game. I think they like dumbed it down and made a weird iOS version. So maybe don't go for that. Um just if you like crime and mystery thrillers this this is a a brilliant story.

Samuel
01:44:38
Yeah, Zero Time Dilemma was the um other one Matthew. Zero Time that's it.

Matthew
01:44:41
Yeah that's it.

Samuel
01:44:42
I w I always thought it was baffling that this only released in North America in the West.

Matthew
01:44:47
Yeah, I mean i I think it had like a moderate audience just because uh DS was region free. So it wasn't too much of a problem. Like anything like that you just you just import. Um but yeah it was frustrating. Um particularly because they bought over part two and you're like, you know obviously now you can get them all quite readily available on on like Vita, I think, as well. Definitely on PC. They they bundled up one and two on PC, maybe the whole trilogy, in quite a nice PC port. I mean they're not visually spectacular or anything, but And I don't know if sitting at desktop is the ideal way as with a Saturny and all these things. Maybe a good one to test out on your um Steam deck.

Samuel
01:45:28
Yeah, exactly. I think it is quite funny actually that I the idea of using my PS5 to play this is quite funny. Um which I I I do own this on um PS4, so uh Yeah, always meant to play it, but um no a a cool choice. You know, it's had a it's like you say added a a a massive reputation even though the fact it was from a you know a smallish developer and publisher.

Matthew
01:45:47
Um it's just it's impossibly twisty, you know, like it the the guy is uh amazing at doing twists and like completely, you know You will definitely be like knocked on your ass like a handful of times playing this game. It's it's really, really satisfying again. Big heart choice.

Samuel
01:46:08
If I can ask a a a kind of question for people who are like relatively new to this Shaman Matthew, what's the order people should play? Phoenix Wright, Dangan Romper, Zero Escape?

Matthew
01:46:16
What's the kind of like uh Phoenix Wright's the easiest one to get into because like tonally it's f it's friendly. The mysteries, you can kind of get your head around it. It's it's it's a recognizable sort of world. Um I'd then probably say zero escape in terms of It's less of an acquired taste than Danganromper. You know, it's a really juicy thriller, a bit a bit edgy in places. But mechanically it's quite smooth. And then Dangan Romper's got like some arcade elements which make it a bit more hectic.

Samuel
01:46:50
Um so yeah, ace attorney, zero escape, dangam romper. Yeah. Okay, good stuff. Well I'm I'm glad I asked that 'cause I think people um probably another series will be curious about from hearing you discuss it. So uh yeah. But um PS4, super cheap um way to get hold of that game. It's often on sale, the uh nonnery games collection. So Yeah. Number three then, Matthew, for me is Bayonetta. So earlier on your list. So like I say, it's more of a heart choice than vanquish. At the time I was massive on Devil May Cry, some of the Devil May Cry entries on PS2, one and three. Um I was less bothered by four, though I four, as I've mentioned in previous episodes, had some depth that I wasn't I wasn't good enough at the game to truly get to grips with, but I thought this was a great sort of like return to that 3D action genre from Kamir. uh the director and his team, they really created quite an interesting character, a kind of like a weird and wacky world that was quite easy to love. a bunch of weapons that fit together really perfectly, like elemental gauntlets and obviously like a big sword and a whip. And um had such such kind of like a dense progression system and like um sort of layers of stuff to unlock that you really needed to play it twice to get the most out of it. And obviously had um Fly Me to the Moon in its soundtrack, which was a great sort of like um motif to to use in this game. Really gave it a like a nice flavour. So you had this earlier on your list, Matthew, what's your take on it?

Matthew
01:48:13
Yeah, I it's A game like I I love playing it, I really admire it. I definitely have never got like the maximum out of it or probably any cameo action game. Like I just don't have the the dedication to kind of learn to play them properly. So there's something I always feel like there's something slightly out of reach with his games, w where I'm concerned. Um Also, I'm not mad about the world of it. Like the the character and the humor and the cutscenes, not quite my bag. Um I know there's like some Sega. like nostalgic stuff. I think it doesn't it open with like the funeral of Eggman or something. Oh yeah, I think that's right, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and that's that's funny 'cause like obviously any bit of the Sonic universe that dies is a step in the right direction.

Samuel
01:49:00
You're collecting rings in the game as well, which feels like Sega.

Matthew
01:49:05
I remember just the start of this where you're you're fighting on that tumbling clock tower. Um And just being like visually like I couldn't like it's so smooth on 360 anyway. It was so smooth, so fast, so spectacular, you just can't drink it all in. There's so much going on. Um it's wild, like one of the wildest like visual adventures. So while I don't really buy into like the fiction of the of that world, like as a as a visual thing, of course, absolutely amazing. I mean It gives you I mean you basically you know the bosses escalate until you are, you know, basically fighting God in space. Um Which is how all games should end. They know how to end a game. This probably should have been higher up my list in hindsight.

Samuel
01:49:50
What um it it depends.

Matthew
01:49:57
Yeah, I just ca yeah, I just feel bad because it's it's nowhere near as clever or sophisticated as Bayonetta. Like, it's like a tenth as sophisticated. But I can like I could sort of fully do it. I could fully appreciate its smaller scale and get my head around it. Where here You know, I know it can do more, but I can't necessarily do more. But that's okay. I think the game's got a really cool attitude towards it. It has that like ultra easy difficulty mode where you basically just hold a button. and it does like the wildest combos imaginable. Yeah. So like anyone can see this game like at its spectacular best, but I think when you're trying to play something y you know, you are trying to kind of play it and do it justice and there's something about like getting a load of like stone medals at the end of every fight 'cause you were so shit at it and you were like, oh yeah, that looked rad, I had a really good time and then the game's like you got the worst w le score for this. Yeah. Like, oh, okay. I mean that's that's you know, I was having a good time, so who cares, I guess, but that's something I've never quite been able to like sort of rectify my head is is that kind of the the gulf between what can be done and what I can do in a cameo game. I think it's I'd I'd say it's the only thing which kind of Stumbles for me.

Samuel
01:51:17
I think what really helps build the bridge to sort of like newer players with this, like you say, the easy automatic mode, that's one thing. The other thing is that the uh dodge slow-mo element actually like really gives you a chance if you're a player who feels a bit unsure about it. Like um A, it feels really good as a system. I know that some hardcore Devil May Cry players fucking hate that system because, you know, everything on the internet is about gatekeeping with your favourite series. It's a load of old horseshit. A bit like the fallout thing I mentioned earlier. But I really dug it as like, oh, you know, here's a thing that any player can get. It's like it's um unlike the really, really abstract c um counter systems in like Bloodborne and Dark Souls. It's just you hit the button when you're about to be attacked, and then you dodge it, and then there's a a few seconds of slow-mo where you can like get your bearings again. And I thought that the learning curve in this is really really good actually. I I would say I I don't think I ever encountered a A boss that I found super super hard on like a normal difficulty setting. I found it like quite a comfortable experience and yeah, like I say, I really enjoyed it on a replay. I just felt like I really got to grips with it the second time around. If anything, the reason I don't like the second one as much is because the weapons didn't fit together in the same way. I didn't feel like I ever got a loadout that I liked in Bayonetta 2.

Matthew
01:52:29
Um it's yeah. It's got some weird pacing issues as well in that it's like a lot more of a succession of giant boss fights. Yeah. Like there's less interesting kind of gauntlets of multiple enemy types. It's a little bit off the second one. Yeah. Amazing peaks, but it's not as kind of consistently entertaining for my money.

Samuel
01:52:50
It lacks some of the fun touches that this one has too, like obviously the um motorbike sequence where the afterburner theme is playing or the Space Harrier sequence that is just Space Harrier. Um that's I I I I dug that stuff. I thought that the Capcom and Sega references were really fun. I think I probably agree with you that like when I really think about it, I don't there's nothing about the world or the enemy design in terms of like their visual design that like really jumps out to me. But I think Bayonetta herself is a great creation. She's like It dated weirdly well. I think I at the time I thought, Oh well this is just quite a horny design but then you read like, Oh no, a woman designed this and actually like has uh seems to have persisted as a kind of cultural figure, bayonetta, in a way that I didn't necessarily I guess I just didn't really comprehend as someone who was like in his early twenties writing about this stuff, you know?

Matthew
01:53:35
Yeah, I d I d I don't have a problem with it on that sense. I just think it's weirdly talky for a game where the writing isn't like particularly like witty. Yeah, yeah. Like I find that with quite a few platinum games. Like whenever I get to the cutscenes, I had this with the Wonderful 101 as well. They just go on like a minute too long. I'm just like, ah sh like for a game which has got such hectic action. they're quite plodding in their like narrative sort of interludes and I dunno. Uh it's that that I think that's just a bigger platinum problem.

Samuel
01:54:07
Yeah, for sure. I do remember reading the Edge review of this as well and thinking that was a great review. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a classic Rich Stanton review, isn't it? So um yeah, by member being a very good bit of writing. So yeah, I love I love Bayonetta. I still love it all these years later. I hope the third one comes out but I'm not I'm not as I'm not that invested in it. Either way, this remains a um a classic in my memory. So what's your number two, Matthew?

Matthew
01:54:29
My number two is the ultimate Castle Heart choice. It's Last window, the secret of Cape West.

Samuel
01:54:37
Yes, there he is. He's back. I feel like the first I feel like Hotel Dusk got a bit of attention, Matthew, but maybe this one didn't at the time. Is that fair?

Matthew
01:54:44
Yeah, I don't know if this one ever actually came out in the States.

Samuel
01:54:47
Hmm. Definitely come out in Europe though, right?

Matthew
01:54:49
Yeah, yeah. And we got it if if it did come out in the States, we definitely got it before them, which was which was strange. Yeah. I just don't think Nintendo paid for this game to be made and I don't really know why because it doesn't fit in with you know it's not a classic Nintendo series I guess it has some of the novelistic elements that they were trying to push with like Leighton. Because that was always how they saw Professor Leighton was like, mums who like reading will like it. But this is very different tonally. Like I don't think a mum would enjoy this sort of scruffy man sort of mooching around his apartment for like fifteen hours. Kind of being bit stroppy with people, which is basically all the game is. Like Kotardus, you play Carl Hyde, who's a sort of investigator in the sort of eighties. I don't think it's the seventies, I think it's the eighties. And yeah, you return home to your building. People are being asked to move out because the building is being sold, and there is one last mystery to be solved in the building before you leave. I've definitely spoken on this podcast before about my theory that this was about like the end of days at seeing it.

Samuel
01:55:54
I love that theory so much, and it's so sad that they didn't they shot that down for you.

Matthew
01:55:58
Yeah, but they did shoot you down. They said it was just uh just a sad circumst you know, just a sad coincidence. Um but there's this air of nostalgic finality through Lost Window that I absolutely love. I don't think I've connected with like the vibe or mood of a game. Like this is a mood piece more than this one. It's still quite jaunty and the characters are quite silly when you talk to them, but the fact that you're just in this apartment building is quite unspectacular and the lives of everyone in it is quite unspectacular and it's this sort of sense of It's not a dramatic end, it's just kind of oh god, we've all gotta move out. This is a pain in the ass. I played it, uh I was reviewing it, and I played it I think in the I was on hot I was down at my parents' place down in Devon and like everyone else was off down to the beach constantly or off out and about and I was being antisocial in my room. Um this is a good like lonely boy game because Carl Hyde is this sort of sort of bit of a loner in it and I was sitting in this house playing this little thing kind of in my corner somewhere. And I just really tapped into its sort of its its sort of wintery vibe. It's setting the run up to Christmas. The highlight of the game is an absolutely amazing. uh Christmas Eve scene basically the whole story just pauses for you to have Christmas Eve with the other loners in this building and you sort of go down to this diner and someone cooks you a meal and you play a game of billiards to try and win a better roast dinner for and you kind of chat to these you chat to jazz about a sad man at a bar and it's just such a vibe this game. Very simple mechanically, not a not a lot going on. It's it's sort of like a a a kind of really a visual novel with a more complicated 3D kind of movement interface. But I just I I don't know what it says about me as a person, like when I played it that I really connected with it. But it's it's a it's a good game for like lonely nights. I think it sings best, it's most consistent, coherent game. I ha it has that emotional connection with them closing. Interestingly, Singh made another absolute shiter of a game this year called Again, which was this like FBI thriller. They didn't make it with Nintendo, I think they made it for like Tecmo or something. It's absolute garbage. So it wasn't like they were completely knocking it out of the park. But this was just like a beautiful s full stop on the Sing story for me. And uh I expect its eBay prices to go up.

Samuel
01:58:32
Yeah, yeah, and you should make some good returns off of that UNCEX. Yeah, I think that's uh that's a great a great Matt Castle pick. And you know I knew I knew a lot about what Hotel Dusk was, so um it's really nice to hear you uh you know kind of bring to life what the setting of this game is.

Matthew
01:58:48
And it's it's like maybe less obviously like engaging as a mystery than Hotel Dust. Like it's a bit less lynchian because it you know, you're not all total strangers 'cause it's where you live. But it's still got a lot of that vibe, uh which is of it's just something I've never experienced myself. I've never sat in a diner late at night drinking coffee. But you play this game and you're like, yeah, that's just what it's like.

Samuel
01:59:14
I have after an E3 conference, you know, just had some steak and eggs and then just drank three cups of coffee at like And 8 pm, but it's probably not the same, Matthew. Where I I don't think Carl Hyde's wearing a lanyard with like uh Shenmi 3 on it, for example.

Matthew
01:59:26
But yeah, were you solving a dual heist while you were doing that?

Samuel
01:59:29
Yep, so Yeah, a great pick, a great pick. I also this was like a series where whenever you talk about it on Twitter, people are like, oh yeah, that's really cool. But I feel like not that many people. I've actually played Hotel Dust 3 to completion, and probably even fewer have actually played this game at all, Matthew. So Yeah, maybe.

Matthew
01:59:46
I'm I'm surprised no one's like. rift on it. I always think if I if I had like developer powers or could rustle up people to make a game happen, like an indie project. Yeah. I I you know I would kick start a spiritual successor to these games. Mm-hmm. I think like what the core thing of what they do of like a very limited location that you grow to know intimately over quite a long game and they're still you know, they're like twelve, fifteen hours or something. Yeah. I think people would kind of go for it and maybe there'd be enough hotel dust fans to kind of make it happen. But um yeah, I'm just too lazy.

Samuel
02:00:20
I understand, it's okay. Okay, great pick, Matthew. So my number two is Mass Effect 2, a very predictable uh choice here, but another defining game of working games media for me. I sort of um have mentioned on probably the Mass Effect episode that I didn't have loads of affection for Mass Effect 1. I thought that the universe felt very confident and complete when it arrived. I was very impressed by it as a feat of world building. And then I I liked some of the party members and I finished it and then didn't think much of it. Then when Mass Effect 2 came up There was this kind of like momentum built up for the series. I think a lot of people have just dug what the first one was doing and were keen to see how your choices would carry across to the next game. how meaningful that would be. And obviously they pitched it as like, you know, they they swapped this RPG style combat with, you know, dice rolling in the background for a more straightforward third person shooter. You know, it felt like more like a shooter with an interactive story, basically. But that actually worked incredibly well as a sort of contemporary take on the RPG. And obviously had like a a near-perfect group of party members, just a really compelling bunch. I mean obviously mileage seems to vary. on Jacob and Zaid a little bit. Um but you know generally speaking found a lot of them very engaging like Thane obviously Morden And you know, we've talked about the embarrassing uh uh straight boy watching Chuck Miranda, a sort of horiness going on at the time. But yes, I think that this was like the best Mass Effect game for sure. And I reflect on it very fondly. It's been nice to see Mass Effect's reputation um elevated a little bit this year from that collection that came out. How about you, Matthew? This is on your top ten too, wasn't it? So you were obviously massive.

Matthew
02:01:56
You know, maybe I don't have the same like emotional ties to it that than the games I put higher than it, but yeah, a as an improvement over the first just incredible, you know, pro probably one of the the strongest sort of sequels ever in games. The way it ties all the companion missions into the central thread, like the momentum and the direction of you have this suicide mission, you're building a squad. It's actually very rare to have an RPG where it's got such clarity of what you're trying to achieve that it can just thread through everything in that game. Like it's incredibly It's kinda cohesive. You know, and you know, I think the payoff at the end is is is fantastic. Yeah, I I just I just love that, you know it' this idea of this really tight focused RPG that can give you everything you want but in a story where I actually have some idea of what I'm trying to achieve at every given moment it's a really special game.

Samuel
02:02:49
Yeah, I think we talked on the um Mass Fight episode, which is definitely worth a list if you've been playing those games, um, about the fact that the collector's focus in this one. means that you're kind of detached from the main Reaper narrative and therefore it's got a bit more leeway to make your choices matter because it's kind of like a big story within the story essentially. And um yeah, like you say, I think that that clarity is a very good point. I think the only downside is that it doesn't communicate to you exactly what the consequences are of waiting too long to go and do that suicide mission at a certain point. That's literally the only thing I'd um level at it. Planet scanning as well, your mileage might vary a bit, but you know, generally speaking made that galaxy feel huge and I think by turning you into this sort of like borderline criminal figure when you were this mythical hero. Obviously just incredibly um incredibly exciting. You just feel like you're you're m it's just a bit edgier, a bit more a bit less like you're just working for the good guys and trying to bring down the bad guys. And yeah, I really I really just loved that and I still I still love this game now. I mean I haven't played the new collection version yet, but I did play through Mass Effect 2 a couple of times. Just phenomenal stuff. Just yeah, cast a long shadow other over other bioware games, so they haven't reached these heights again still. But I hope that they do one day. And uh yeah, otherwise I think all of our thoughts are kind of neatly tied up in that episode, weren't they, Matthew? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, cool. In which case we come to your number one. I think I can guess what it is.

Matthew
02:04:11
Ba ba ba ba it's Super Mario Galaxy two. This yeah, uh just how how lucky were we to just get another load of Super Mario Galaxy, um It's kinda hard to be too sophisticated about Super Mario Galaxy 2 because you know it it's sort of a bit of traditional sequel making that you actually don't get from from Mario normally. Like this doesn't tend to happen. They they sort of move on and create the next masterpiece instead. Um here you just get the feeling that they had so many ideas, so many offcuts, they shove it in. Some people call it an expansion pack. I mean, that's a bit sneery, and if it is true, it's the best expansion pack of all time. One that arguably surpasses The original I tend to take them as one thing, I bundle them together 'cause I find it quite hard to kinda divorce one from the other. I I you know, structurally I'd say that you know the the the big difference is that I think this one gets the action a bit faster. It doesn't have the complicated kind of comet observatory, it's a bit more of like a sort of linear map system. It sort of just gets you into the levels that bit faster. So it kinda has a a bit more of a kind of madcap energy to it, which I liked. I don't you know, the the Comet Observatory stuff is is the is the least interesting bit of Mario Galaxy 1 for me. So um I didn't miss it. It individually levels fabulous some great new power power-ups. I loved Cloud Mario which is basically the ability to make three platforms, which in a big 3D platform like this is just wild, opens it up for some crazy stuff, opens it up for an end game which is so much better than Mario Galaxy 1 which was Do It All Again but with Luigi here you have purples Are they green or are they purple stars? I can't remember. They're either green or they're purple stars hidden in the levels. Basically beyond the realms of where you thought you were gonna go. These aren't just like the star coins in like you know Super Mario 3D world where it's like, oh look behind that bush and there's one. You know, some of these you look at them and you're like, that actually seems like outside the bounds of the level. It's kind of that mentality that I was talking about when we were doing the previews of Mary Galaxy way back when when we were just trying to break the levels and use Mario's athletic moveset to get outside of of the space you were meant to be. It felt like Nintendo going, we know that you can do that and that you like to do that. So let's put some collectibles kind of in really bizarre places and you'll either have to use power-ups in really interesting ways or you'll have to do like the craziest long jump of your life to get there. I I thought that was just a a brilliant twist on it. You know, drill Mario just powering through these planets. It's so physical and satisfying and the way it takes ideas from the first game and mashes them together into into new things. So even if there are familiar ideas, they're always presented in a fresh way. It's just wild, unhinged, just joy this game. Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are are the I mean they're the best platform is full stop.

Samuel
02:07:16
probably still my favourite games of all time. I I love hearing you talk about Mario. I think you um just so sophisticated with how you discuss it. I think as well, like I always I'm always wondering why when Nintendo hits across a formula like this that's really good. Why it doesn't more frequently double down on it. Like I don't know why we don't have Odyssey 2 by now, for example, that does that, you know.

Matthew
02:07:36
Yeah, it is a bit of a mystery. Galaxy 2 does sort of mark a change in terms of they make Galaxy 1 and they make Galaxy 2, which is like riffing on the same idea. Mm-hmm. And then they make 3D World and then they make Captain's Toad Adventure, which is like riffing on the levels from that.

Samuel
02:07:56
Yeah.

Matthew
02:07:57
Then they made three and then they did the Bowser's Furit like they have revisited these things and in and and when they do revisit They do follow a sort of template in that it's ideas that didn't quite make the cut the first time, or it's like, well, you've already got your head around the mechanics in the original game. So here's like here's like the the the that mechanic squared kind of thing. So yeah, i we are missing that with Odyssey. I c whatever I cannot wait to see whatever they're making next. I mean, I assume we it won't get announced like into E3 next year or now. I mean yeah. I I haven't been following their you know I I haven't like mapped out which directs they use for what in the past, but that that feels that feels like too big just to be like Oh, we'll tell you about it on Wednesday kind of thing.

Samuel
02:08:46
There are some theories that Nintendo has sat on a load of games, right? That are kind of just done basically on Switch. Um And uh they're just sort of slowly portioning them out. I don't know if that's true or not because this year feels quite fallow to me, but I don't know.

Matthew
02:08:58
Yeah, I I you know, I I I do secretly hope they have this Mega Switch and they're sitting on some stuff because they want to go, you know, this is good on your Switch, but like we made some of it with Mega Switch in mind, and it's really gonna blow your mind and That would be like my dream outcome. I mean I say dream outcome and it would involve having to spend four hundred quid probably, which would suck. But I you know, I do wonder if they have this bigger software ch change in mind, y you know, surely there would be something big to be paired with it.

Samuel
02:09:31
Yeah. What difference does uh Yoshi make to this game, by the way?

Matthew
02:09:35
Uh yeah, he's great. I mean it's a it's a really great version of him. I was reading my rev my review of it and he's he's the power-up with power-ups. I described him. Because he eats his different fruit which changes him. He turns into like a big helium balloon. There's like an electrified version which casts out light, which you use to kind of explore some like invisible levels. It's kind of like an X-ray mechanic. Yeah, he's really fun and they use him well throughout like he's not just there for a couple of levels. Like he's he's he's neatly kind of dished out through the whole thing. He's got he's the first level he's in he's got this like incredibly catchy koji kondo tune which I don't know, maybe we'll try and include somewhere in this podcast. The music in this game's obviously sublime. But yeah, yeah, Yosh Yoshi's you know, he's a he's a A you know, a good back of the box feature.

Samuel
02:10:24
Does it frustrate you that this wasn't included in the All-Stars collection, Matthew?

Matthew
02:10:27
Yeah, it's mad. Like, I just don't know why they wouldn't do it, because it feels like it was built. You know, it's made out of the same parts, it's got the same kind of sort of skeleton to it. Yeah, it doesn't doesn't make any sense. I thought they were gonna go surprise if I can have it like a few months in, it was gonna be really fun and then they didn't do that, so

Samuel
02:10:46
Well, if you have a Wii U you can play it on there, so that's something.

Matthew
02:10:49
Yeah, yeah, it's but yeah, it's a shame that it's m not more it's not easier to play.

Samuel
02:10:53
Yeah. Ah great pick though. I mean obviously, you know, it's the Matthew Castle pick and um Yeah, I thought your list was really cool. A good good balance of Nintendo stuff and um HD era stuff.

Matthew
02:11:03
Thanks, Samuel.

Samuel
02:11:04
Yeah. Yeah, no problem, buddy. Okay, so we'll come to my number one, which is Red Dead Redemption. So very predictable number one. Happy to own up to that. I think um GTA 4 was my pick for best game of 2008. So obviously I was I I have been like a a bit a bit cooler on recent Rockstar in some of these podcasts, but I actually I I'm I'm not really. I appreciate that their games are like massively hard to make and you know I'm I'm less into the online side of stuff, but I say that having still played like two hundred hours of GTA online so I'm talking complete horseshit basically. But I still I still love what they make, but this era, do you have GTA 4, you have GTA 4's DLC, you have Red Dead Redemption, then you have L. A. Noir the next year, and then you have Max Payne 3, which is you know the lesser game of that bunch, but still That's still quite an interesting thing that they made. And then you have GTA three sorry GTA five in twenty thirteen. So an unbelievable run from Rockstar there. Just you know some fantastic stuff and we've talked about bully in previous episodes too. That This is just like probably the most I've been into the output of a publisher or developer from any period. I just really love these games. Red Dead Redemption, when I was on X360, I saw this in the preview stage. They just showed us bits of it and it, you know, it was like applying GTA sort of template to a a Western open world. But it looked um the action looked better than GTA four. It has better combat than GTA four. Um has obviously the Deadeye feature, which arguably makes the shooting a bit too simple to do. But I think that it actually um Just gave it a bit more in the way of action chops that it needed that GTA 4 didn't have. I really appreciate it as a as a kind of like um uh sort of bonus. I think that obviously the setting was w very well realized. The main character, John Marston, this guy who was essentially under duress by, you know, the earlier form of the FBI to essentially give up his old buddies, to stop his old buddies um in order to kind of like uh be able to live a peaceful life, which is obviously a lie that they sell him. That's a really good idea for a a kind of story. Obviously takes a lot from um Unforgiven, the Clint Eastwood film, which I actually only watched for the first time last year. And it's quite interesting to see the sort of like the bits Rockstar took, the bits it added itself. uh Rockstars games are a lot talkier than Western's, I would say, generally speaking. Um and yeah, I just I just really love the variety of settings as well. You start in a more sort of trad western uh sort of like small towns, kinda like desert setting, then you go to Mexico and kinda get embroiled in a sort of civil war. Then you come back to what is basically a more modern version of life, a a a more sort of like sophisticated town setting. And there's a real sense that you're trapped between these different eras of of America like a and and and necessary changes coming. One of the reasons I think I haven't played Red Dead Redemption 2, Matthew, is it seems to like It seems a bit too connected to the story of this game. I kind of I was hoping they'd do a new set of characters and stuff. I understand that what they do is very sophisticated in Red Dead Redemption 2. But I think this just makes such an impact as a story and a world. that I kind of um I kind of would have wanted more of a clean break from it. But um nonetheless I um I I adored this game at the time. and I replayed it in twenty fifteen or twenty sixteen and I still thought it was fantastic. Obviously the ending to this game is kind of legendary. Matthew has dunked on um some of the choices later in this story, which I uh for reasons I c I kind of understand. But the switch of main character and some of the stuff they do to um set up John Marston's eventual demise, particularly with the um strange man character you meet out in the wild. Really, really impressive stuff. The best rock star storytelling had been up until that point. Matthew, what's your take on this one?

Matthew
02:14:33
Yeah, I I do love this game. I think I connected with it on on a slightly cruder level, just as like, oh cool, it is like a spaghetti western I can play and it looks like a spaghetti western and I love the gunplay and it is easy, but I love how cool you look when you do it and I love the slow mo. I think it's really, really well used. I love this era of like weaponry. I d uh you know, I love the kind of mechanical heft to everything. When I first started playing this game for review, I just I would just endlessly create trouble in Armadillo, that first town you arrive in, just to get the police in and have a shootout around those eight houses. Honestly, just that would have probably been enough for me. Like that just felt like, oh, this is like a Western. I'm running around on rooftops. I'm hiding behind the saloon sign on top of the building that I've climbed on. you know, I'm sniping out sheriffs as they kind of dash from door stop uh doorfront to doorfront. It just that game just makes scenes from spaghetti westerns happen. in a really satisfying way. As they get more sophisticated, it almost feels wrong to use them as just dumb throwaway play pits. Yeah. you know, my memories growing up with Rockstar Games is kind of causing chaos in GTA and then seeing like how many stars you can get up to and how long you could last. Like that's that was messing about in those worlds. And now it feels like you know, these characters are so sort of psychologically real that they're not really meant to be used for that in the same in some way. Yeah. But I definitely got that from Red Dead Redemption. Like it was just a You know, it was a place where you could tie people up and put them on the railway tracks. Hilarious. You know, you could just create trouble and see what spiraled out of it. Very, very fun. I think it's it's like mission structure and design is a little tired now. I think Rockstar have got a bit better at that stuff. It's the kind of go to this ride out to this very long dot and have a you know, r five minutes to a dot on the map and have a gunfight with a very long conversation on the way. I got a little annoyed by how many kind of quick timey event mechanics there are in it in terms of things which felt like They introduced and then they never really went anywhere, or they didn't become like things that you did elsewhere in the game. They made for like maybe more memorable cinematic missions, and that's definitely a problem with their later games too, but I don't know, there was something a little a little off about that. But yeah, as just a place where I could make cowboy fun happen, I absolutely love this game. I love the physics of like shooting people and watching them crumple or fall downstairs and stuff. Oh, it's just it's magic, isn't it?

Samuel
02:17:09
Yeah, it's fantastic. Just yeah, I I I echo that as well. I I enjoyed the kind of open world elements to it as well. I think that I actually didn't have a problem with the mission design. I appreciate it that it was a bit shorter than GTA 4 actually. I didn't need this to be a 40 hour game and it wasn't. It was closer to like 20 hours.

Matthew
02:17:23
I think the thing that bugged me is is I I'm not a big fan of the Mexico section. Everyone says that, but I don't think there's a I don't actually think there's a dip there. I don't really get people's problems. There are these two things that are warring and you go and do favours for both of them and you're just like ping-pong-y between them. I feel like I'd I'd done that like one too many times in a rockstar game. Right. The kind of playing both sides against each other, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know. I but that's that's that's the only reason it drags. I mean, as an actual setting, great, and obviously you get the the famous riding your horse while a little jolly tune plays. Jose Gonzalez, yeah. Yeah. Uh so you know, th yeah, I'm I'm definitely I uh you know There it there there's plenty of good stuff there. I just felt like the the GTA-ness of their thinking came through clearer there than it did elsewhere.

Samuel
02:18:16
Yeah, I think that's probably fair. I think that your point there about kind of causing chaos as a character who's quite rich emotionally is is a a weird thing as a player. Obviously this is the direction Rockstar chooses to go in. Like you only really get hints of that sort of textured storytelling in the PS2 GTAs. Um probably more so in San Andreas than the other ones. But, you know, in in this generation they're obsessed with like being taken seriously on a storytelling level, it seems. Which is, you know, and And press went along with it, but you know, arguably there is that whole element to, you know, the open world stuff that is talked about less. I think Trevor in GTA V helps to offset that a bit. by just being a guy who who would plausibly steal an airplane from a military base and just go shoot some civilians.

Matthew
02:19:01
Exactly. probably still haven't played it, but you know, there's stuff in Red Dead 2 where like just the character's life situation is so at odds with having fun that you're like, it would feel wrong for me to go and do all this cool stuff that you have put in the game, but it just doesn't gel. I should play that at some point, shouldn't I?

Samuel
02:19:25
Okay, yeah, good stuff. Well, you know, I will play that second game at some point, Matthew, and have Oh do, it's great, it's great.

Matthew
02:19:31
It looks so good.

Samuel
02:19:32
Yeah. Well I've just Oh, I've just finished, you know, a a a game that's coming out very soon, so I've got um I've got I've now got a free slot.

Matthew
02:19:40
So uh Yeah.

Samuel
02:19:42
Good stuff. So that's twenty ten then Matthew. We've got some honourable mentions here. Should we fly through those? And um yeah, yeah. Do you wanna go do you wanna go first? Pick one?

Matthew
02:19:49
Yeah, I I wanted a little shout out for the much maligned Metroid Other M. Mm-hmm. Which is wonky as hell, but has a core action mechanic of you can do a timed dodge And if you do a time dodge while you're charging your beam, it instantly charges up and you can deliver like a full-powered shot. That core little jump blast, jump, blast is so mechanically tight and satisfying that I cannot you know, I s I think that game is a is a solid action experience which is marred with narrative sort of

Samuel
02:20:24
Fluffed, gumpf.

Matthew
02:20:26
Yeah, just just a load of guff around the edges. And you know, it's been mean to death. I think people are a little unfair on it. I think they're ignoring that once you cut away all the story The Metroid stuff in it's actually pretty decent and it's got some really nice mechanics, so Yeah.

Samuel
02:20:41
Yeah, absolutely. No. There's no hey on other M This it was also like probably the the nicest looking Wii game there was. It just looked amazing. So shiny. Yeah. It was exciting.

Matthew
02:20:51
What a f it was a fun thing to get excited about.

Samuel
02:20:53
Yeah, just possibly the wrong format. I wonder what uh a world would have looked like if this had come out on like Wii U at launch or s something. It might have been them might have been a bigger hit. But yeah, the story was terrible. I remember sitting through the cutscenes thinking, why have they done this? Like what were they thinking really? The Just this very simpering, boring main character. But yeah, I um I thought it was uh perfectly fine as an action game. So um yeah, nice to hear you give it a shout out. So heavy rain, Matthew. I did consider putting this on the list. I will say that the illusion of playing this at the time was mass like uh it was v massively impressive. I really bought into it. You know, uh we we've obviously like the people have memed the terrible rating that's rife in this game. And you know, there are complicated thoughts about David Cage generally and you know, Quantic Dream. But I think their games always look fantastic. And this was the first time Uh I I think I got into this in the way that I got into that first bit of Fahrenheit where you're, you know, hiding the body and stuff. I think that I really just bought into the idea of this interactive story. And the mood of it really worked for me. So I liked it, but um accept it it's it's it was very flawed in retrospect and couldn't make my top ten. How about you?

Matthew
02:21:59
Yeah, I n yeah. Like, it's definitely worth playing, it's definitely interesting. I think people have got a very selective memory when they talk about the tone and the kind of sophistication of this game. There's a lot of talk about the scene where you make your son dinner as a as a lonely dad and a lot of people gloss over that it ends up with a big fight on a conveyor belt above a trash compactor. So It's uh it's pure it's this game is pure us by the end, I think.

Samuel
02:22:27
Uh is, yeah, but I I felt like some stuff it did well. I liked Norman Jaden like Uh his sort of eye starting to bleed as he's using his eye his like glasses things and I felt the stakes of it, even though it's uh I just feel it gets held up as this sort of um high at the time is this sort of high sort of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

Matthew
02:22:45
of um bar for oh we're moving on this is a lot more adult but there was also a scene where you got chased around a basement by a mad professor so yeah but also

Samuel
02:22:56
But also I think that history's done its part to like our peers have done their part to like dunk on this game endlessly. And there are probably more worthy targets, but Because this is high-minded, it paints the target its back a bit, you know.

Matthew
02:23:08
Like at the time when I reviewed this, I I may have told this story before on here. Like, I was sitting in the games cage. And a load of people came over from Playstation. Official Playstation magazine. Yeah. Who I hadn't I didn't really know at the time. And they were like, uh Oh we uh we heard you don't uh we heard you don't like heavy rain, you know. You think you know heavy rain kind of vibe. And it's like yeah actually. It ends with a f uh uh on a caver butt of a twelve trash compactor, it's infantile. Uh but they came over and like strung on me of like, ooh. You know, 'cause they didn't want to feel like they were silly, I think, because they'd given it nine or ten or something stuff stupid.

Samuel
02:23:47
Yeah. I I I probably would have given it like a a nine at the time, but you know, I I I played a a bit recently and the writing is rough, but it does still look fantastic. Like it's oh You you kind of just have to see it as a grand illusion. You either buy into it or you don't, and that's it, you know. But as a y critic, you're really doing your job though of being but being bold about what this didn't do well and just pointing it out and people were so willing to buy into it in the moment I can see why that had real value as criticism. So you know uh th the strong arm story is very funny though. So a but very brief shout out for God of War Three, which I didn't think was the best in the series, but certainly looked amazing. Had probably like the best the opening. where you're fighting uh Poseidon. I think you're clout climbing Olympus did look fucking amazing. Probably the best looking thing that ever happened on the PS3. Just phenomenal. But um generally speaking just kind of felt like a bit of a retread. Wasn't wasn't really a big heartpick for me the way, Matthew. Did you play that one?

Matthew
02:24:42
Uh yeah, off after the fact and Yeah, you know, it's God of War doing God of War thing. Yeah. Well I like the bit where you chase after him with the fast sandals. That was three, wasn't it?

Samuel
02:24:54
Uh yeah, yeah, I think so, yeah. Yeah.

Matthew
02:24:56
Him to still like you chop off his feet or something.

Samuel
02:25:00
That's a very Kratos thing to do, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, imagine him telling that story in like God of War on PS4. So there was this fast guy, I chopped off his feet, it was like a whole thing. Um Yeah. So yes, good stuff. What about what's another one of yours, Matthew How do you feel about Splinter Cell Conviction? Yeah, I played this recently, thinking maybe I should have a take on it for the podcast. I think it's one of the most interesting exponents of like the uncharted influence on games. Very story-led. Quite short. Don't think it's either a phenomenal s action game or stealth game. Not a bad merging of the two. What about you, Matthew?

Matthew
02:25:37
Yeah, it's probably fair. I think A couple of the the the the ideas it introduced, like the mark and execute, are incredibly satisfying. That's like a really good power fantasy, the idea of like if I can get all these headshots lined up and then I'll just ping them off and it looks incredibly cinematic. Um obviously that style like dominates now of kind of games that I kind of would rather be kind of cool looking than uh mechanically deep but at the time it was s super polished. I love the carp on this. Really good little carp campaign. With a st with a sting in the tail. Ah. Which it has to be experienced, I would say.

Samuel
02:26:13
Oh shit. Okay. I'm ge I think I could guess what it is, but I uh I now want to see that. That sounds cool.

Matthew
02:26:19
Yeah, it's good. It's it's you know, reuses a lot of the locations, but with two people doing all that cool mark and execute stuff it's It's it's pretty fun. It's like the best of the game kind of like multiplied.

Samuel
02:26:29
Yeah. To level a little bit of criticism in it, I would argue that Mark and Execute compensates for the fact that they didn't really give you proper over-the-shoulder aiming to do proper shooting. It's a bit more clicking with the stick to zoom and haphazard. So it's almost like they hobbled it as an action game. in order to make that mechanic cool.

Matthew
02:26:45
But um that's probably fair. It also like really goes off the boil in like the last third. Like the environments are quite playful and fun and you can like clamber around the outside and jump in and out of windows and then it sort of ends with quite a slog through like an airfield I think.

Samuel
02:27:01
Yeah. I mean not a popular take, but But the uh torture scenes of this are pretty cool, actually. Um They're pretty dramatic. And slamming dudes' heads into like, you know, toilets and context-sensitive like animations on torturing dudes I kinda dug that. I thought that was actually like pretty pretty different and pretty um pretty exciting in the moment, you know.

Matthew
02:27:21
It's very like Jack Bauer, wasn't it? It was kinda like you'll do anything to to complete the mission.

Samuel
02:27:26
Yeah. At a proper like contemporary angle on like what a split of the cell was though. So yeah, I maybe I'll try and play Blacklist in time for our twenty thirteen episode. I've never played that before. It's I I thought it was a big step down actually. Oh, okay. Interesting. Well uh I guess like another one on mine then Matthew. Very quickly I will give a shout out to Just Cause 2, which I thought was a really fun sandbox game that you know basically fixed all of the problems of the first world. Eh most of the problems of the first one. The world is still a big gorgeous anonymous location essentially. It never has much of a kind of like you know you can't go to a town and be like, oh wow, the individual detail's amazing. It's not that kind of game. But it's like a game where you you know ride on the top of airplanes and stuff. Like um including like passenger planes and then, you know, use a grappling hook to sort of shoot off to uh you know a another part of the environment. You can sort of like um sort of sail through the sky forever with your parachute if you use your grappling hook properly. Just a really fun bold sandbox game that um you know it was a just a a dependable eight out of ten that I played loads of in like one summer this year. So I liked it. Did you play that at the time?

Matthew
02:28:31
Yeah, uh no I didn't, but I I I've pl I've played it since but like big memories of sitting in the game's cage, like Andy Kelly reviewing this for PSN three while I was like playing some terrible thing on our Wii CRT. Yeah, yeah. This just a very like this this is just a game that instantly takes me back to that period. So some sort of like weird nostalgia for it without having much connection to the game itself.

Samuel
02:28:57
Any uh what's another one of yours, Matthew?

Matthew
02:28:59
Uh I I felt like I should probably shout at Donkey Kong Country Returns, which I think s I think some people went nuts for this. I think s some people really, really rate Donkey Kong Country. I don't think it's uh hugely expressive platformer. For me it's always felt like a little bit of a reaction test. Or i the characters don't have the same kind of like acrobatic grace as a Mario. They're a they're a bit more it feels like there's like a solution. to the platforming as opposed to like Marrow who are trying to steer through the platforming. Because of that it's quite hard, you know, it's kinda like do it my way or die. But some people like that. It's I I f always felt like this this this was maybe slightly bigger with like American reviewers and and gamers in general. Like I didn't have m I don't have much nostalgia for the original games. Like I I I always found them Well similar, I I that's what's good about returns, I guess, is that it's quite true to those source games in terms of how it feels and but it has the same limitations, it's it's kind of very sort of snazzy and can do these very um impressive sort of setpiecey kind of uh minecart rides or whatever, you know, like long chained platforming, kind of choreographed platforming set pieces. But they're also kind of limited and not not as satisfying to me to do. But this is this is good. This is like rock solid.

Samuel
02:30:24
It's one I played on 3DS, so that was a fairly decent. um port of it. Yeah, cool. Yeah, yeah, good good choice. I was actually kind of surprised I didn't make your top ten, but um hey I guess it's a yeah.

Matthew
02:30:34
It's just not quite there. I think I still gave it like High high eighties, but it's it's not like it's just not Mario Tier for me. Yeah.

Samuel
02:30:41
That's m that makes sense, yeah. Another one of mine then, Matthew, is um I thought I'd give a shout out to uh Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which I didn't actually make my top ten, but because I just thought it um was a bit too of a much of a rerun of Assassin's Creed 2 a year later. I'm very awary of series that become like yearly and I I thought that happened way too fast with Assassin's Creed. Eventually they dial it back. But um it was, you know It visually uh it was it was like perfectly fine. It was, you know, just more of the same really, but in Rome, one location rather than multiple locations. Added all of these like um at the time like Facebook games were big even though they were terrible, sort of Farmville style mechanics of like um you know building up your own little brotherhood of assassins. And uh generally speaking just didn't think it was quite as good as Assassin's Creed 2. Is that how you felt?

Matthew
02:31:29
Uh yeah, I mean like impressive that, you know, the turnaround on this and Like this prob this seems to like mark the beginning of like Ubisoft going, oh this is what we're gonna do. We're just gonna do a lot of this from now on. Yeah yeah. And like we have the kind of core tenets of our game locked down, so let's just Let's just rinse them, which I guess is like bad in the long run. Um 'cause w I feel like we're still playing this game in a way. Yeah. Um But uh yeah, it's fine. I there's some people going real nuts for this. I I just don't know if I've got the like Assassin's Creed connection for it to be super up there for me. Yeah. What's another one of yours then Matthew? Pick Cross 3D Okay. That was on my list at one point, and I was like, you know what, I like I should probably take this off and put Bayonetta on here because that just that's so arbitrary. Picross 3D is a delight. It's Picross except you're chipping away at these big blocks so it's got like a little kind of chiseling kind of feel to it. It feels like you're chiseling these little um models out of cubes, which I quite like. Very satisfying to play, you know, very tactile feeling on the DS. But it's fundamentally just a very, very enjoyable time waster rather than like anything super engaging. But if you ever saw it in a CX for cheap, I would pick it up. 'Cause Pit Ross is rad if you haven't played it. Maybe a bit more substantially as well, uh this was the year where we had there was like a big Battlefield Bad Company 2 scene in the office. I don't know if it was the same for you. Hmm.

Samuel
02:33:00
There was some love for it, I think, yeah.

Matthew
02:33:02
Yeah, this was just like, you know, one of the few games which I played with lots of future people, which I think elevates it in my head. I think if I'd been playing this by myself I just wouldn't have connected with it, but that's true for Battlefield. I think it's a game that comes alive if you're playing it properly with friends in a squad. Playing this loads with like Xbox World and Andy Hart upon PSM3 was big into it. Lots of people who I sort of like still think of them as their game attacks because we played so much of this. Oh cool. I r the iconic phrase of when the f when the horn begins to sound because you're going to lose someone once bellowed, uh yonder failhorn sounds. Uh which then just became embedded in my head as as this very sort of poetic kind of we're fucked um quote. Yeah, um very unpleasant because my game attack was Mr. Basil Pesto and I can't remember who it was, but s someone started calling me the sex pesto. Which really bugs me. I think I stopped playing not long after that.

Samuel
02:34:04
What would you prefer to be called now, Matthew? Sex pesto or gaming gammon? What's your choice there, those two? Gaming Gannon.

Matthew
02:34:11
Gaming Gannon is definitely l less worse than the suggestion you're a sex pest.

Samuel
02:34:17
Yeah, I suppose so, yeah.

Matthew
02:34:19
Uh and you're like, no no, it's a riff on pesto.

Samuel
02:34:22
Yeah.

Matthew
02:34:23
And that just doesn't sound real. No, not really.

Samuel
02:34:25
It's not a good defense in court I would say. Yeah. Uh cool. Alright, I'll bundle a few more together then. Um so I I really enjoyed split second velocity this year. That was the um silly create your own set piece kind of like with power ups um sort of mario kart riff that was done by BlackRock. This was their last game, Disney shut them down. I don't know why Disney Disney and games the whole kind of like load of nonsense and never understood what they were really doing in that space. But um I enjoyed that and I also enjoyed Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, which is the first entry in that series from Criterion. Just really straightforward, good, like um street racing game basically. And then I I think most wanted, so the twenty twelve one was the one that people really rated as being super rad. So um Yes, good um good racing times, Matthew.

Matthew
02:35:07
Yeah. It was good times for everything. I don't think there was any genre that was like massively underserved.

Samuel
02:35:12
No. I have like so many more. Honorable mentions here. I'm just gonna fire through them like in a big a big list. So I I really enjoyed like uh Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep on PSP was like I don't know how they got that game looking and sounding so good on that console. I know Kingdom Hearts are kind of a contentious thing on this podcast, but This was a really really good handheld spin-off. Yeah, really nice kind of like the best like combat Kingdom Hearts game they've done to that point. They st steadily got better at that side of things. Similarly, I thought that um another game that like has no place in this podcast really, I thought that the remake job they did for Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver was was was quite good at the time. That was a nice little nostalgia shot.

Matthew
02:35:50
I like that it came with a pedometer.

Samuel
02:35:52
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, did that encourage you to walk? I assume not, Matthew Uh if anything you walked later.

Matthew
02:35:57
It was like a nice little pedometer, shame it came with a free copy of Pokemon. Very, very good, yes.

Samuel
02:36:02
And so that aside, I I've also um I I meant I mentioned as an omission here uh Metal Gasolid Peace Walker. Which came out in PSP. Super high budget PSP game. Like undersold a bit. I think leads to probably some of the troubles that come up later on with um Konami and Kojima. Just like probably should have been a HD console game, but was definitely made for a handheld. And the mechanics of which uh uh many of which are are present in um Metal Gear Solid 5 later on. So yeah. Did you play that one, Matthew? I know Stanton was big into Peace Walker.

Matthew
02:36:32
Yeah, I did the uh the when they did the H D thing.

Samuel
02:36:36
Twenty twelve, yeah.

Matthew
02:36:36
Whatever that whatever that was on, I played it then.

Samuel
02:36:39
Yeah, I that's when I played it too. And it's um honestly just ha ha felt a bit pared down, but you know, still really cool to um that people can still play it on a system that's not a PSP. So Yeah, I I liked it, but I never finished it. And so I didn't feel like I could put it in my top ten. Probably not my favourite metal gear anyway, to be honest. So uh yeah. Any more from you, Matthew?

Matthew
02:36:58
Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, which we talked a little bit about on Games Court last week. Yeah. Just a really great mix of RPG and temporal exploration using RBG power is usually confined to battles. Very fun. I like that a lot. Sit in Punishment Star Successor, aka Sit in Punishment 2. Which I l I liked a lot. I I didn't get like super, super into it though. Definitely preferred Sin in Punishment One. And I must admit it's been a while and I can't really justify that opinion. I'd have to replay it, but it's quite hard to play but again, you know, considering where Nintendo are at, absolutely mad that we got this super hardcore treasure shooter at all. Where do we sit? Is Mafia two twenty ten?

Samuel
02:37:42
Oh yeah it is. That did miss my list, yeah.

Matthew
02:37:45
Yeah, it d it didn't make my list. I uh I don't know, I always felt that I feel as well generally with Mafia, it's that kind of weird middle ground between sort of epic open world setting but for quite a linear game and I can't quite marry those two things together in my head. Yeah. Like it feels like a lot of wasted space, but it has got a really great sense of sp Place.

Samuel
02:38:06
Yeah, I I actually had it as my number ten like two days ago. And then there was like a big shuffle between Final Fantasy thirteen and heavy rain and stuff. So lost out. But yeah, that was actually meant to be my main honorable mention. I almost completely forgot it, so I'm glad you brought it up. Yeah, I think it probably didn't help that it arrived like right after Red Dead as well. So in and like you know in the wake of GTA 4 I think it did hold its own as a as a kind of uh a shooter and you know as a story game. But I think that I d I didn't mind the open world setting stuff, no. I I thought it was it was uh like a a rich feeling film set really. I think um we've discussed in the past that Ellie Noir feels largely similar.

Matthew
02:38:45
Very much so, yeah.

Samuel
02:38:45
Yeah, it's like d this doesn't need to be here, but I like that it is here. I would prefer this to a series of levels just connected by cutscenes. So yeah, I I I think it's a good idea. I think it's definitely one of the highlights of the year. Seemed to be quite a divisive game. Like I remember I think it got a four from Eurogamer, which is very, very harsh. But over time, I think its reputation's hold held up. The way it connects back to the original Mafia, really, really good. I don't know if you know how that oh well you would know because you played the remake, right? So um the connection there is really really cool. But um yeah, I don't know if it I don't know if it's like one of the all the top tier games any year that had lots of top tier games. I don't think it quite is, you know. But it's i I it just shows how rich this year was.

Matthew
02:39:25
Yeah. This year also had Red Steel 2, mm-hmm the return of my favourite. Definitely a much better game, a big Wii motion plus showcase. Bit more of a kind of full-on like arcadey experience. Like it's it's definitely better, but I don't particularly love it. But the mag liked it. It got well reviewed, but there was no, there was something a bit it was almost like going a bit more for like a um like a first person kind of devil may cry type vibe. Mm-hmm. You know, it was it was a lot more about kind of sort of comboing stuff together, if I remember correctly. And it didn't quite land for me as a sort of shooter. Yeah, which is absurd because it's definitely better than red steel one which I gave a 92 force. Um so you know, people slapping their heads at that, but you know, I'll be I'll be honest, I don't have a huge connection with Red Steel 2.

Samuel
02:40:19
Yeah. Th those are it for all of my um sensible uh honourable mentions, Matthew. The rest is just a bunch of nonsense. I had like a mu I had a weird like existential crisis at Christmas where I was meant to go home at 10am and I just sat in my flat and played Star Wars of Force Unleashed 2 three times over. I just completed it three times in a day and ended up getting a ten PM train back. Um weird. I d I had a it was a weird yeah. There's a lot going on.

Matthew
02:40:41
It's a bit uh it's a bit um Alan Partridge with its overwrite.

Samuel
02:40:45
Very much so yeah.

Matthew
02:40:46
Do you have any more honorable mentions you want to throw in there? I mean there's there's so many games from this year, but I think I've talked about the really important ones. I was just gonna say I wish I liked Alpha Protocol more. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's like But I just like It it feels like a very us kind of game. It feels like the kind of game this podcast would get behind. Yeah. But I think it is just too shit.

Samuel
02:41:04
Yeah, it is really ropey. I mean I I tried playing it for the first time about three or four years ago and it's like it needed that extra layer of polish and it didn't have it. Yeah, I don't know. I I appreciate people's uh affection for this game though. Um years later. But yeah, weird sell. Sega did not know w how to sell this game. It was tough a tough a tough break, you know. Oh weird weirdo s it's that strange

Matthew
02:41:30
Bower Bond or something, wasn't it?

Samuel
02:41:33
Yeah. It yeah, a bit odd watching all these talking meat puppets try and be like sexy bond characters and stuff. It's just very Very out there, but yeah, yeah, not one I ever finished either. I played about six hours and I was like, Yeah, I've got to make this. My life can move on now. So yeah, good good stuff, Matthew. That was like a a monster episode, but there was a lot of ground to cover. Uh you can go lie in bed now 'cause you've been like quietly ill this whole time. So um I feel bad making you um you get it.

Matthew
02:41:59
If any so if any of my takes were really off that's just the illness speaking.

Samuel
02:42:02
Yep, that's why uh Matthew's so down on Bioshock too. He's just uh out of his mind with fever.

Matthew
02:42:07
So um That's that's why my number one game was Michael Jackson the Experience.

Samuel
02:42:11
Uh that's dated really well that game, let's uh let's face it. The experience.

Matthew
02:42:15
But Michael Jackson experience today is a very different thing.

Samuel
02:42:19
I would say so, yeah. Good, a nice dark joke to end on there. So Matthew, where can people find you on uh social media? Uh Mr. Basil underscore pesto. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter. This was um a massive episode, but next week was a very exciting one too. We've got the N sixty four mini draft.
