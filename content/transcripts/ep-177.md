Hello, and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, are you ready for the draft that we've been dreading the most of all the drafts that we've done? How are you feeling about discussing video game soundtracks? I've been, I must admit, this sound and fun on paper, and then planning for the different categories has become like, I don't know, so kind of nightmarishly insurmountable as a task.
And I feel like I'm about there, but it's a bit dicey. How are you feeling about it?
Roughly the same. Going into this draft, knowing that music is one of the most subjective things on earth. And even from the early rumblings, you know, I'm just primed to disappoint so many people.
Not myself, ideally. That's all I really care about, is can I pick some tunes that I like, but I can already see people circling this draft. Voicing opinions where I'm like, well, you're going to come away very disappointed.
I won't have your vote and that's fine. You know, you can't be all things to all people.
No.
I'm not going to accept some Sega crap that I don't want into my party, ala quite hard right conservative MP joined the Labour Party.
Oh, Natalie Elphick or whatever.
Yeah, I was trying to do one of those. I'm getting into my political metaphors after comparing Dreamcast owners to Reform.
Yeah, fair enough. That was a bold swing that has gone down as well as you might expect in the Discord. Yeah, it's that thing of like circling it is a good way of putting it.
The thing I always keep in mind, people only weigh in Matthew because they're invested in the podcast and they enjoy the podcast. It's important to say that first of all. Before we then say, there's a little bit of like, well, hope this draft ends up having my favorite soundtrack from this.
And it's like, why would you tweet that? It's not gonna make it any more likely that we pick it. And you'll just be more disappointed when we don't pick it.
It's like, it's like soft, soft power. I think that's how all those tweets are seen, but it doesn't work on us because we become more stubborn and we like burrow in even more and like become even more subjective.
We're about desert power.
Fucking desert power. There's a lot of wild analogies going around this evening, which is good. So this will be a chaotic draft.
It is a 20 category draft. So.
Fucking hell.
Yeah, and before we start recording this, we were recording this on a Monday at Matthew's suggestion. And he was like, let's get this over with so I can have some dinner. That's literally what he said before we started recording.
So he's come into this fresh, excited, jolly, and wants to have his dinner. So yes, that will be the flavor of this episode. So here's how it's gonna work.
We've got a brief preamble because we've got 20 categories. No need for us to talk for an hour about video game music. If you wanna read about some quite sincere articles about video game music, there's quite a lot of that is available.
I recommend as well the AIAS podcast where they, that's the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences podcast where they'll occasionally have Austin Wintory interview different composers. So you can get some quite sincere music content out there because this is gonna be all bullshit. And we wanna be very clear about that from the off.
This is big pile of ass and we are owning it. We are officially owning it. So don't expect this to be like, to pay tribute to all the wonderful composers who have brought our favorite video game music to life.
Absolutely not. This is gonna be two men yelling game names at each other.
Yes, this is not Louise Blaine on radio.
Yeah, very much the opposite. So we do both love video game music though. So even though we think that we will struggle a tiny bit when it comes to the actual like, trying to describe music bit of this, we were a little bit nervous about that.
You know, we appreciate video game music as much as anyone else. So we got our own takes on this stuff and you will see in our picks that we have very much, you know, it very much reflects our tastes sometimes. That music will come from some of our favorite games.
Other times it might come from elsewhere, but you know that this isn't just a draft of, you know, one video game platform or one genre. This is literally every video game ever basically. So it's a really vast field and it has to come down to some subjectivity.
So it might be a little bit different to some of our other drafts, Matthew. So yes, nerve wracking. Okay, so to kick off the old classic preamble, do you remember the first video game soundtrack you liked, Matthew?
Something like Link to the Past and just how atmospheric and strange that was. And me and my friends who were playing it, you know, turning it on for the first time, turning to each other thinking, well, this is a bit, this sounds a bit unusual and interesting. I wouldn't say we were necessarily like discussing the equalities of these soundtracks in depth, but the music's always been a big part for sure.
You know, I'm sure I've told the story on this about like going to a sleepover where we had a second N64 there plugged in just to play the titles music of GoldenEye All Night in the Background. One of the more cursed parties I've been to.
That's classic like teenager kid nonsense that is. I remember when I was a kid, my friend Callum had a party where he invited everyone around and they were going to drink Iron Brule all night and try and finish Final Fantasy VII in one night. And that was gonna be the party.
Again, very cursed. Only boys in the noughties were capable of this kind of nonsense and possibly the nineties.
I mean, just based on the timing, that's incredibly difficult. Like at best, that party ends with Aerith's death and then everyone has to go home feeling really bummed out.
Yeah, Aerith's death and everyone feels like absolute shit because they haven't slept. But I think his plan was to actually like do it in shifts. So like you'd go to sleep and then someone else would be like, well, I'll do the motorbike bit outside mid-gather.
And it's like, yeah, it's not gonna work.
Because I didn't know how to do save disks for Monkey Island on the Amiga. The only shot I ever had at finishing Monkey Island 2 was someone had a sleepover and they'd let me bring my Amiga. So I'd be up all night trying to play it.
That unit of time doesn't exist anywhere else in my life.
Yeah, oh well, it's very powerful stuff there. Powerful reflection of memory and music. So, okay, so I will talk to you a bit about the sound, first video game soundtrack I liked, Matthew.
It was a little game called Sonic the Hedgehog. The music sounded incredible coming out of the Mega Drive. I just, it just really conveyed something.
It was just playful, fun, a little bit. A tiny bit moody. First Sonic's got a slightly different vibe to the rest of Sonic.
Sonic's a lot more sort of like, you know, you just sort of like drank a liter of sugar water basically, and you're absolutely off your head, just like caffeineed up. That's Sonic from Sonic 2 onwards and never really changes. First Sonic, a little bit gentler.
They're like no spin dash, so the music's gonna be a little bit, a little bit sort of moodier. That was kind of like the thinking of old Knacker Man there, I think. But yeah, so.
That's what you called him once. You called him Knacker Man. Now I just call him that sometimes.
And so I will say though, it did take until I started playing Father Fantasy games for me to start thinking, I would like to listen to this music outside of the game itself. I never really had that relationship with music before. And there was, there's plenty of music before this that meant there was like a big deal to me.
I really enjoyed obviously the Red Alert soundtrack. Frank Klepacki's kind of like Hellmarch and all that stuff is kind of a bit of enjoying it. Ironically, in that sort of Starship Troopers way, I guess, just because it's so preposterous and you're literally fighting Stalin and it's just ridiculous.
And even though you mentioned Zelda, Link's Awakening as well. I thought the music in that was incredible, especially because the canvas, the Game Boy, the original Game Boy was just so primitive, relatively speaking, and they got so much out of it and that music really stays with you all these years later. So yeah, but then when I started playing Final Fantasy X and I was 14, that had a function in the game, which I don't know if any other Final Fantasy's really done this.
Maybe 15 has, because it has the in-car radio, but it has like a music sort of arena that you go to in Luka, one of the cities in the game, and you can buy all the different tracks that are on the soundtrack, and there you can just listen to the game music at your own leisure, basically. And I'd never, I mean, I've come across obviously sound tests in every game you can think of from Sonic the Hedgehog to countless other stuff, but this was interesting because it was literally a place you went to in the game. It was like a kind of concert hall, basically, and you know, TDS just played the different music that you selected from this screen.
I thought it was a really nice touch and really celebrated the music and really cemented it in my mind. And it's definitely sometimes for us to sort of hang it out and play the different tracks in there, coming out of my portable TV, that audio quality must have been fantastic.
Does the character, does he bop his head to the music? Is there any kind of acknowledgement that he's listening to the music?
No, he just presses them from some kind of screen, really. It's like an elaborate sort of jukebox, basically, where the jukebox is sort of hall-sized, I guess. It's very much, it's just a static screen, but you see him doing something.
So it feels, it's got a little bit more meaning than if it was just a sound test screen.
I want him to occasionally look to the camera and just pull the kind of, ooh, kind of face, and maybe give you a little kind of like thumbs up or that. What's that sort of A-OK kind of hand gesture? You know, the kind of, ooh, yeah, this is the good shit.
You and me, Sam.
Yeah, well, he just does like, he just does one of the kind of like four or five canned animations he has in Final Fantasy X. So I think he does have a thumbs up one. He does one where he scratches the back of his head when he doesn't like a bit of music.
That might be good. He does one, we can do one where he sort of like does the sort of like prayer thing they do in Final Fantasy X when they, the Yevon prayer thing with his arms. He can do that when a particularly holy bit of music comes on.
Yeah, that would be good, but sadly not.
I want a radio station voiced and deejayed by the Shoe Puff, the guy who says Shoe Puff.
I appreciate still. This is your primary angle on Final Fantasy X after all this time. I do appreciate the Shoe Puff.
That's all I got. It's proved a very rich font of humor for you and I respect that, but I did like the soundtrack enough to even buy it. I bought this soundtrack, it cost me a lot.
I bought it from Playasia. It cost something like 38 quid or something. It was not cheap, but this was before Spotify and other streaming services and the like.
And so it wasn't really easy access to music. But then, yeah, so I would say Final Fantasy is kind of like the basis of my interest in video game music outside of the games themselves. So I was curious, Matthew, if you had much of a habit of listening to video game music in your spare time, like historically and even now.
When I started the job probably is when I started listening to it a lot more, just because I had it like easier access to it. And I had, I think a big thing actually was the Smash Brothers Brawl soundtrack, that absolutely massive thing. Like I just found someone that uploaded it online and I just ripped it all down to my work PC, which I probably shouldn't have done.
And just had, you know, 300 tracks of like Nintendo classics reimagined, which I wrote most of my in-game work to. That soundtrack had the same flavor as what I thought that magazine needed. So that really got me into it.
I think the first actual album I owned was like an orchestral covers album of Ace Attorney music that Catherine got me. But you know, I'd listened to other things. What I'm probably more into the orchestral covers of older music or newer soundtracks, which are orchestral in nature.
I can't say I get a huge amount of pleasure out of listening to like Mez, Mez, Mega Drive originals. It's a little bit bloopy, bloopy, but that's a thing of personal taste. Where do you stand on that?
Yeah, I think I kind of agree. The good thing about the way that Square Enix has already capitalized on the interest in Final Fantasy is that you can go and get basically orchestral versions of pretty much all the bloopy, bloopy music that comes up in the first Final Fantasy, first six Final Fantasy games. There's one from, there's an orchestral version of one from Final Fantasy II that I thought was absolutely beautiful.
Gosh, I can't remember the actual, the name of the track now. I didn't think I'd bring this up, but it was something I just listened to over and over again for years. And it was just like, just as kind of like very sort of impressive live version.
Is it the Rebel Army? I think it might be the Rebel Army that plays this. In any case, very, it works, it works really, really well.
I went to HitPlay on Spotify and it didn't work. I thought it was gonna confirm it either way for me that it was that piece of music, Matthew. Either way, I'll figure out what that is and maybe put it in the show notes.
But yeah, so I think when they do that kind of thing, it really helps. At the same time, I can still enjoy that music a great deal when it's in a game like the music in Phoenix Wright is not something I would listen to in my spare time. Maybe some orchestral versions I would be into, but at the same time when I'm playing a game and it's just like, and you've had that breakthrough bit of evidence and then you press further and then the witnesses start shitting themselves in the stand.
Not literally, of course. That drama still really works. So I very much appreciate it, but not listen to it in my spare time, no.
It's sad. The orchestral Ace Attorney soundtrack is, whenever I listen to it, my mind just becomes fixated on how do we one day make an Ace Attorney film happen where you're in charge of it somehow because it would just be so good. It's so exciting and I could just hear it.
Basically, I just wanna hear that music booming out of a cinema sound system. And I honestly think the quickest way to make that happen is to somehow get an entire film made rather than breaking into the Odeon and just playing it on a CD player. That's what I want, but it really invigorates me and that's like an all-timer, that CD of covers.
Yeah, that sounds like a good hang. Is that on Spotify, do you know? Because I know a lot of the Ace Attorney originally used on music hits.
Yeah, I think so, I think so. I mean, these things are quite readily available on YouTube and other corners of the internet. There's a really good album of jazz covers of Phoenix Wright as well.
Some fit better than others, but Godot's theme, which is already very jazzy, given a proper jazz version, is really exciting.
What about Lotta Hart's theme? Does that always bang for you, Matthew?
The orchestral album's got a courtroom suite that works all the different phases of the courtroom into one track. And I think if I get to see that live played by an amazing orchestra, that'll probably be me pretty happy. That's like a bucket list.
Sat next to your best friend, Shootakumi. That's like the...
Yeah, well, he's often at these concerts in Japan. I just think, oh man, what a thrill it must be for him to be able to walk out on stage and be like, yeah, this fucking rad thing. This happened because of me, but I had to do like no work to make this bit happen.
That must be a cool feeling.
Yeah, for sure. I've been through various phases of this kind of music obsession as well with different games. And sometimes it's just tied to a particular game I like.
I went through a big Mirror's Edge soundtrack phase in 08, 09 kind of time. That soundtrack by Solar Fields is really, really good. And it's just as much a part of selling you on the slightly weird dystopian atmosphere of that game as the gorgeous art direction with its bright colors and the contrast and just how unique that game looks to this day.
Music was a big part of that. I've had big Metal Gear music phases. It broke my heart when they had to take out the main theme from the Metal Gear games for MGS4 because some guy had played some bit of music that allegedly ripped off at some 2006 games convention or something.
They went, oh, Hideo Kojima, doesn't this sound similar to the main theme of Metal Gear? Then after that, they didn't use the main theme. And I would argue that the guy who showed Kojima that should be in jail because I didn't get to hear the main Metal Gear Solid theme in MGS4.
Why would you film that encounter? All you're doing, you're basically doing copyright striking live. Why is that good for anyone?
I put it to the court that this private citizen should be in jail for that.
I honestly, but honestly, if I get like one, you can put anyone in jail.
And that's what you'd use it on?
No, it wouldn't be that guy. There's a long list, but he would be on the list at least. He would be the top 300 of the list, Matthew.
He's on the list for some of history's biggest bastards.
So yeah, I've been through that. And basically all the Final Fantasy music, I've got quite strong relationships with the soundtracks to all those games. At the same time for this draft, I'm a little bit like, oh, maybe it's too obvious to just pick a load of Final Fantasy stuff because people would just be expecting that from me and maybe you want to try and subvert that a little bit.
But there is a little bit of like, you can only really pick what you like. And so it's quite challenging to balance that actually generally for this draft.
But yeah, I've not made that like a focus at all. Like I am 100% picking a load of stuff I'd like to listen to. And if you don't like it, then we just won't be pals.
And that's fine. I don't care. I've got this amazing collection of music.
No, that's kind of where I am too. It's the ultimate subject of draft. So there's going to be a lot of people going home unhappy, but either way it will be hopefully be a good time for celebrating the music.
The two most important people won't be going unhappy and that's you and me.
Important in this one specific scenario and at no other time. Okay, so do you think game music is seen as credible now, Matthew, in the way that people want it to be seen? Or does it face the same battle for credit as games themselves?
And IE, it's a fight that we don't care about.
I don't know. I kind of find it hard to talk about. I don't really kind of care what the consensus is on how people think about video game music.
Maybe it's like crude and too populist, but I see it and film soundtracks as like the modern classical, it's classical music, orchestral music for a more modern appetite. If anything, I think game music is kind of outpacing film music. I used to listen to film soundtracks a lot, but a lot of film music doesn't do it for me anymore.
It's this fucking curse of, you know, there's millions of videos about it online, all this people editing to kind of backing tracks that they then just get them to repeat and it all becomes a bit of a sludge. I get way more of a hit from game music than I do film music now. Definitely the last five years, like the marvellification of film soundtracks is, you know, sort of criminal.
It's only really one, Marvel's only really one small bit of it. I mean, MCU has completely exited my pop culture diet, so I don't even really think of it when I think of music. I think of like the music in Nolan films, all that music is fucking incredible.
It's just, I don't know if I entirely agree with that.
Yeah, that's absolutely fine.
Or John Williams music, you know, still pretty great.
Yeah, but I just, I don't know, I used to listen to it, you know, that is what I listened to, you know, when I was a teenager and at university and college was film soundtracks. And, you know, it's so rare that I hear anything where I'm like, oh yeah, I want to hear that, you know, again.
You need to get into the music of Max Richter, my friend. That's very, very good, spooky space music from the Ad Astra soundtrack. That bangs.
And this is a personal taste thing, maybe. It's like a lack of subtlety in some video game music that I actually respond to. Like, I think a lot of video game music goes really, really hard and announces itself in a way that people would be embarrassed to do that in a film soundtrack, or the kind of wisdom now is that you don't do that.
You just saw Challengers at the weekend. That's a film that, like, lets its music play over people talking. That's quite unusual in terms of, like, sound mixing.
There's plenty of it out there. Sorry, I'm getting too defensive now, but yeah.
I've probably gone in too hard on that. I am more thinking about the era of just endless hummable theme tunes and games occupy a similar space in terms of most games are about heroism and so the truly heroic music, if that's what you're into, which I used to be very much into, I think is better represented in games. But you're right, yeah.
There's plenty of films which are not drawing from that tradition. If you grew up endlessly playing the Indiana Jones soundtrack, it makes sense to me that what you are now listening to is video game music and not blockbuster soundtracks.
Yeah, I kind of know what you mean, the hummable element of it is.
Yeah, but I realise not everyone wants that, you know.
No, it's fine. And obviously I'm always here for your endless MCU soundtrack digs, Matthew, I enjoy those a great deal.
Well, I don't even think that last Indiana Jones soundtrack was much caught.
I was curious, Matthew, if you think a good soundtrack can elevate a bad game into a decent one. How much of a swing can music have on the experience of playing a game?
A huge one. I mean, there's lots of games that probably got 10% higher in my reviews because I really like the music. If I'm having a good time listening to a game, it can trick me into thinking I'm just having a good time playing the game.
The classic example of this is Sonic Lost World, which is not a good game. It's a 3D Sonic game and so bad, but it rips off a Mario Galaxy soundtrack and with a slightly faster kind of Sonic sort of tempo and that is so potent, I came out of that game. This is actually pretty amazing and it's just an amazing soundtrack.
I don't know about bad games as such, but certainly some games that are just good, I think they can elevate into like a great game. So I would say the games of Suda 51 are a little bit like this, you know, like I don't, I think No More Heroes is really good. I think that's still my favorite of his games, like the most complete feeling of his games.
But the music in that I think just is like transformative to the overall flavor of it. It's just so like underlines this kind of like lazy, cursed, fake Santa Monica place that you live in and how every shop has got Heavenly Star by the Genki Rockets playing when you go in there. Just a sort of like, I don't know, there's just something about the sort of cursed vibes of that game that works so well with that kind of an electronic kind of soundtrack.
It just sort of really comes to life. And I would say the same is true of Lollipop Chainsaw, which is not a best in cast, the person sort of hack and slash game. But the music, well, there's a few different bits to elevate that game into a great one, I think.
And the UI is part of it, like some of the sort of HUD elements that pop off and in this quite cartoonish sort of way that brings a lot of life to these quite static 3D models on the screen. And yeah, the music in it, which is, I think, partly, it must have been partly selected by James Gunn, the game's co-writer, because it has a load of the music that would later appear on the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack. So that was him putting his stamp on it, I think, and it definitely brings it brings it to life a bit more.
So yeah, I don't I don't think it can necessarily transform a bad game into a good game, but it's it can definitely swing it either way. A few points, 10 points, probably a good way of putting it, I think. It's sort of that that seems like the percentage impact it can probably have.
The beauty of old magazines scoring like having a graphics score, an audio score and a playability score or whatever, is that you could have a terrible game that gets a 10 for audio just because you know, it's awesome or likewise an awesome game, which has like a one for audio because the music is just absolutely terrible. It was a famous, I always remember this quote from NGamer's Excite Truck review where Kitsy described, I think the audio got like three out of ten and he described it as music piped directly from Satan's bumhole, which is just a great bit of like old school, pure old games magazine trash talking. But I am, yeah, always made me like, made me laugh.
Yeah, that is good. I suppose that along those lines, Matthew, vice versa, can bad music ruin a good game?
I don't think so. You could just turn music off. Basically, I couldn't think of any examples where there was a great game or a great game that was slightly lowered because of the soundtrack.
Max Payne 3?
Well, I'm not gonna go there. If you like a man kind of going over a load of drums, then fucking knock yourself out. And plenty of people do.
The only thing I could think of for this was that legendary Resident Evil 1 track that occasionally does the.
And you're like, what the fuck? It just sounds like a mouse running along a keyboard. Really terrible.
Yeah, I sort of... This is where I decide to be slightly controversial, is that the rock band Guitar Hero thing never really happened for me other than the Beatles one because I kind of hate that sort of music. It's sort of like people who are like, you know, dudes with ponytails who are like, I've built my entire personality around thinking the Ace of Spades is like the best thing in the world.
I just... That is so not my kind of guy. And so I just...
And I knew a few people like that when I went to Imagine who were just like, when it was Guitar Hero party time, I was like, oh, fucking hate this. There are exceptions to this. There are types of, you know, when you get to the more of this, I guess, like less heavy Rolling Stones side of this, it's a bit more, or, you know, smashing pumpkins.
I kind of get that a little bit more. But yeah, there's just, I don't really care about sex pistols or I definitely don't care about kiss rock and roll all night. Why would that make you feel anything?
I just hear that. I'm like, yeah, I guess dads listen to this like 30 years ago, who gives a fuck? That's that kind of so that the magic of that didn't really happen for me apart from that Beatles Rock Band game where I was like, oh, finally some music I actually like in one of these games as opposed to sort of it being one or two tracks that I might actually enjoy from these things.
Like I think I think there's a Muse track on Guitar Hero 3. I can't remember which one now. Maybe it was Knights of Sidonia.
I think that might have been the one that made it on there. So occasionally there'll be something I like on this, but yeah.
I like Surrender by Cheap Trick and Guitar Hero 2. That's good.
I'm glad you were to note that. Thank you. But yes, it's so that kind of music.
If I hear that in a game, I'm like something that approximates, you know, hard rock and roll and it's just a bit, just that has no real flavor to me. I don't really get it. But you know, that's the thing about music is subjective.
You can completely despise something that enough someone else loves. It's maybe the most objective thing there is. In fact, this might as well be the food draft.
You know, if we were like, I'm taking like halloumi for category two cheese and you could be like, fuck halloumi. I like feta, you know what I mean, like it's, that's the kind of thing we're talking about basically.
It's funny that in my head I was like, I'd actually be sad if I didn't get halloumi. That's what I was thinking.
There are so many good cheeses, goat's cheese, halloumi cheese.
Yeah, but I'm very like super mild on cheese. Like I'm not a heavy cheese guy. Like halloumi is like the safest rubberiest cheese.
It's basically sort of dairy Lee for sophisticates.
Oh, that's ridiculous. It's not even got the texture of dairy Lee. It doesn't even taste like dairy Lee.
No, but as in it's a mild cheese. It's an entry mild entry cheese.
Yeah, beginner level cheese.
Yeah, it's like dairy Lee, laughing cow, halloumi, processed cheese slices.
Cheese strings, you know, all those. Cheddar with marmite in it. That might be a little bit strong for you, actually, Matthew.
So yes, don't remember what we're talking about. But the last question I was going to ask you, Matthew, in this preamble, are there any particular types of game music you find yourself enjoying more than others?
Yeah, big, big sweeping orchestral stuff. Stuff with a big band. Unfortunately, for people who don't like Nintendo games, there's going to be a lot of Nintendo picks from me if I get my way in this.
Because what Nintendo is currently doing, like the direction it seems to be pushing a lot of its soundtracks, which is just having a load of incredible musicians jamming out around iconic themes. And that is very much my jam. I can never quite put my finger on what it is, but sometimes when you listen to certain tracks, I think you can really hear everyone having a good time playing it.
It sounds like a jam session rather than, you must strictly record this music I have written. And it goes back to that footage they released of Mario Galaxy when they were recording Gusty Garden Galaxy, and Miyamoto is in the room and he's just like completely not losing it. He's like lost in the music, his head's just swaying.
And you're like, yeah, that is absolutely right. That is what it's like to hear really great music Miyamoto. I'm much more into that than when people release footage of, we recorded this soundtrack in a Hollywood sound studio and here's a really stern load of classical musicians playing, you know, in perfect harmony.
I much prefer always like Japanese session museums jamming out to Mario Kart 8.
That's funny because I do appreciate that kind of music, but I also like it whenever you watch a sort of documentary about the making of a game and they're like this bloke, right, in this little tiny, tiny sound studio in the 90s, was in there by himself like 16 hours a day and came up with like the greatest first-person shooter level music you've ever heard. I love a story like that and I love the resulting music, just sort of like just these absolute bops made by what just sound like one guy, absolutely grooving out. I can only imagine by himself, just that's the scenario I like to imagine, just locked away sound designers.
Sometimes you get that when you go to on studio tours, don't you see like composers and the guy does the CFT's music, I cannot remember, is it Robin Beanland?
Robin Beanland, yeah.
And he's got like all these different sort of instruments he uses to make the amazing music in that game and he'll just get them out and show them to you. But there is that sort of energy of like, this is this cool music room where he hangs out and does this stuff all day. And so I've always got the impression that like composers, there's a bit of a lone wolf energy to actually making it.
And so I kind of appreciate it when it's people, yeah, like people in a studio just like coming up with this stuff. There's not necessarily loads and loads of people and all the sounds are being recorded individually, put together. So yeah, I think I like Japanese RPG music, all of those esteemed Squaresoft era composers who are, most of them are still working now.
Obviously, Uematsu is the most famous one, but there are tons of them who have recurred across the different Final Fantasy games. I know all of their names and some of their signatures and their music is just so amazing at creating worlds and defining those different games. Obviously, they have to completely redo the universe of a Final Fantasy game with each mainline entry.
So music is a really key part of making that work. So having to come up with a new battle theme each time and the fact that they can and make sure it fits in line with the rest of the sound of the album. I'm really, really impressive when that sort of thing pops off.
At the same time, yeah, I love kind of electronic music as well. So some of my picks here reflect that. A big appreciator, like I said, of a good first person shooter, sort of like bop basically.
I think that always kind of goes down well. Yeah, I think anything can kind of get me. But I don't like bland orchestral music.
There are so many. There are actually like quite a lot of western sort of games. I couldn't tell you like the music in Battlefield got no idea what that music sounds like.
I couldn't tell you at all what any of the music is. Maybe that or is there music in Dead Space? Couldn't really tell you?
Not really, not really sure.
It's more just sort of like, eeee, wee, wee, wee.
Yeah, it's sort of like, and then obviously, and then I appreciate the music of Capcom, for example. Capcom's music tends to be very, very good. Even then, I wouldn't say there are like bops in Dragon's Dogma 2.
They're just like, occasionally there's some good music when you're climbing up a monster and it goes, and it really kicks in, you're like, oh yeah, let's stop this guy in the head about. But it's like a bunch of times and that's good. But like, you know, the classic sort of like Rezzy Mercenaries music, that kind of stuff I love as well.
So yeah, but it's really, it's really run the gamut, Matthew. But I think we're not going to have that much crossover in some of our picks here. So it's going to be interesting to duke it out.
Yeah, if anything, like the challenge to this draft is like not stepping on your own toes, which can happen between the two halves of it, which I'm sure we'll get to in a minute.
Yeah, with that in mind, Matthew, let's take a quick break and come back with this monster of a fucking draft.
Welcome back to the podcast. It's time for the draft. It's a bit more complicated than the usual drafts for a few reasons.
The first reason, there are two different categories of picks. There are album categories and track categories. So basically that means there are 10 different categories that are you picking the overall soundtrack for the game, and then track categories where you're just picking one track.
And the distinction is important because we decided that playing 40 different samples of music in this episode was too much. We are on dicey legal ground with it anyway. We don't know how this works.
We'll use short clips. They are purely for critical purposes only. Sometimes that covers you.
Sometimes it doesn't. It seems like a bit of a fuck show to be honest.
Enjoy this episode while it's still alive.
There's a reason this podcast isn't on YouTube. We can't be policed when we're on a cast. That's fine.
Basically, you're going to hear for the track categories, you'll hear a sample of the different tracks. That's because I think the album category is going to be a bit broader about why the soundtrack is good for a certain game, the different ways it brings that to life. The track categories are a good way to illustrate the minutiae of how game soundtracks work.
So I suppose that's why I decided to do it that way, Matthew. Do you think that makes sense as a distinction?
Yes. I think it's also important to point out that picking in either category rules that game out from both categories, if that makes sense.
Yes. So you pick for what the category four of track categories, you pick a game there, you can't then pick it in album categories basically. So we think it needs that to increase the drama a little bit.
Yeah.
It heightens it because games come off the board then and 40 games will be picked. You know, that's a lot of games. There's more games than we've ever picked in a draft before.
So that adds to the drama a little bit. So that's the key thing. You've got album categories and track categories, 10 of each, and we'll be picking them simultaneously.
We won't, there won't be a pause. We'll just be having to pick from all 20 categories as we go basically. So it's, you'll basically hear track category, for track category two, I'm going to pick this basically.
That's what you'll hear. And then yeah, that's, oh, we're going to do that across all 20 categories. So it might be a bit chaotic, but hopefully that makes sense.
To have a glass of water and prepare yourself for it if you need a little bit of time to process how that'll work. So yes, the rules are we'll pick for both categories simultaneously. Picking a game across either set of categories rules it out for both to heighten the stakes.
So the key thing is we're going to be conducting the vote in the announcements channel of the Discord for the first time. That's because Twitter, since Elon Musk bought it, has not been functioning properly. So the polls just seem to freeze after like three days and we can't really work out what's going on there.
On Discord, they've had quite a good poll function, so you need to have an account to log in. In theory, you can create multiple accounts if you really want to fuck the poll up, but I would hope that our listeners have too much going on in their personal lives to do that, but you can't rule it out, Matthew.
That's got big team castle energy.
Yeah, I see Matthew's entire family come in under different pseudonyms. So yes, you'll see the announcements channel in the Discord, it's right near the top of the list of channels and then the poll will be there. I'll make sure it's there when you click on it.
And if you need to get into the Discord and you wanna vote, if you go to twitter.com/backpagepod or bluesky slash backpagepod, you will find a link to the Discord in there. That's like a permanent link invite. You could jump in, you can just register your vote and then you can jump out again if you want.
We're not arbitrarily trying to grow the community. It's just because it's a good function and Twitter isn't working properly anymore. So that's that basically.
And then yeah, it'll be up for a whole week and you can vote for the winner and then we'll talk about the winner in a future episode. So I look forward to that. Matthew, anything else we should say as we get started with this?
I haven't really thought about my tracks necessarily in the context of the games. I've maybe thought about them more as standalone things that I like listening to. I think there's lots of great music, which makes much more sense in a game that I would never listen to.
Just cause like, you know, they're harder work or like they're grim genres and things, you know, some clanging industrial soundscape of a horror game may be artfully done, but I haven't really considered it cause I would never listen to that in my spare time. So yeah, that's kind of, I don't know if you approach it similarly or?
Honestly, gosh, this runs, there's so much of my history in games generally here, that it's actually just like a massive, there's no real pattern. There's no real through line other than Samuel Roberts. There's not, on the track side, it's a mix of like, there's a tiny bit of me thinking, what would people vote for a little bit?
There's a little bit of that that comes into it. Like, is this a good pick in terms of I like it, but also people might actually vote for it. That's definitely a consideration more with the tracks than the albums, I would say, because I know people are gonna listen to them and they'll respond emotionally to what they listen to because music is very powerful, obviously.
So it's tricky, it's tricky. But yeah, I think I understand why you see it that way. That kind of makes sense.
So Matthew, I guess we need to read out the categories. Were quite hard to come up with. And after I came up with this, I wondered if we still maybe needed more than we had.
I was there thinking maybe we needed an open world music kind of category or like a license music category or something like that, but we've not done that. So yeah, don't consider this like comprehensive. This isn't gonna cover all of video game music, but enough apologizing for the categories.
I'll just read them out now. So, album categories, category one, RPG, category two, indie game, category three, shooter, FPS or otherwise, category four, platformer, five, game soundtrack where music plays a key role in the gameplay, six, fighting game, seven, bleep bloop, brackets, retro game soundtrack, 16 bit or earlier, category eight, 90s as fuck, category nine, cult favorite, category 10, free pick. Now for the track categories.
Category one, theme tune that rips, category two, battle theme that rips, category three, earworm of any description, category four, features lyrics, so self-explanatory there, category five, ambient open world or world map music, category six, rhythm action favorite, category seven, the Yoko Shimomura category for a piano absolutely popping off, category eight, boss theme that rips, category nine, free pick, category 10, the game over category, this must play at your funeral. So if me and Matthew pick that, you have to imagine that when we die, that will play out our funeral. So lots to dissect there, Matthew.
And I don't know if I can be bothered to read all that out again before we start doing the episode. So what I might do is just paste those into the description of the episode so people could just read those again if they want it for reference, because yeah, it's a lot of podcasts time wasted on reading those out. But any thoughts, Matthew, on how we've done this?
No, I mean, like we say, I think I'm more interested in the album track divide and the ability to remove a whole game off the board by picking just one track. Obviously, if you take an album, it has all the tracks from that game contained within it. So the tracks feel a bit more special in a way because they're so kind of targeted.
Yeah, that's probably where like more of my thought went was trying to get a really good selection of tracks.
Yeah, I think that's probably true. The other thing is if a game does come off the board, there'll be a certain amount of like flailing as we figure out what an alternative pick might be because picking a specific track is a bit trickier than just picking another game, I think. So it's, I've got backups for some categories, but not all categories.
I don't know if you've approached that.
Yeah, the things I'll be picking first or earlier are the things where I haven't got much. Yeah. And I'm like, I've got one where I've got, really only have one pick for it.
And like, I'll be sad if I don't get it, but also like, if we were playing maliciously, you can really fuck each other over by taking one track and removing like a huge killer soundtrack off the board.
Yeah, and I think that will happen at some point. But I also think there is one thing that, this one juicy pick that I wonder if we're both eyeing up. I'm curious to know if we'll, where that will land.
So I guess, Matthew, let's do the old coin flip to decide who goes first. So we'll do the old snake draft thing where basically, whoever gets the coin flip can decide whether to go first or second, first person picks first, and the second person picks two picks, and then we go back to one pick each until all 20 categories are exhausted.
What do you fancy heads or tails? Tails.
Tails.
Tails it is.
Then I will decide to go first.
Oh, okay, interesting.
You got it pal. Okay, so for album categories, category six fighting game, I'm taking Super Smash Bros Ultimate.
Interesting.
Gets you over a thousand tracks across Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Earthbound, Metal Gear Solid, Kingdom Hearts, I mean, it's absolutely vast. And if there is a competitive element to this, quantity is on my side with Smash Bros Ultimate. I believe the soundtrack to this game is bigger than all other Smash Bros soundtracks combined.
So it's a huge old thing, a massive library of Nintendo's history and also different tendrils going out to various Japanese publishers' histories as well. Yeah, it felt like this had to be the first pick, Matthew. What do you think?
Yeah, I mean, it's definitely what I had down for fighting game.
I think there has, yeah, that's pretty tough. All right, it's not ideal for old Castle in fighting game. But I'm sure we'll circle back round.
And basically, wherever I pick for fighting game, there's a good chance a lot of it will be represented within Smash Brothers Ultima already.
Yeah, that's just the nature of it, isn't it really?
Yeah, I could, even trying to pick Super Smash Brothers Brawl, most of those tracks are in this game too. Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, that's, I mean, yeah, it's fine, you know, there's one of 20 picks. There's lots.
It's true.
There's lots left on the board.
I guess I should pick a track. I don't know if you did this in the end, Matthew. Originally, I was going to say, oh, we should pick a track for each one.
Oh, no, I didn't do that, because there's too many variations of what we could end up picking. I don't even know who composed half these. I just couldn't do that level of research for this episode.
So like you're getting a game name and nothing else.
Every composer in the universe worked on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, basically. It's a huge living library of video game music.
It's an amazing archive. And therefore I think it's the right game to be the first pick here. And again, like I really like Smash Bros.
as a party fighting game, but I don't think it's like necessarily like a best in class kind of competitive experience. Very much the kind of archival nature of it is a massive part of its appeal. So picking it for a fighting game category in a soundtrack draft seems to make the most sense in terms of representing why it's great, I think.
So yeah, that's where I'm at with that one, Matthew. So you now got two picks.
I now have two picks. Just because it's a trickier one for me, I'm gonna pick for tracks, for the Yoko Shimomura category, for a piano absolutely popping off. I am taking Final Fantasy XV's Omnis Lacrimum.
That's a nice pic, I like that.
So the truth is, there's lots of Shimomura soundtracks I really like, but the very specific wording of it absolutely popping off. When I was going back through them, I was like, does this really count as popping off? She wrote some absolutely beautiful music for Zenoblade Chronicles, but it's just very wistful and low-key.
I think a lot of the games that I've played of hers that I like, there's a big strings thing going on, but this one has the huge choirs, it has big strings and somewhere in the mix, there is, I'm going to assume her plonking away on a piano, like desperately competing to be heard, just in that massive sound. I love the Vinyl Fancy 15 soundtrack as a whole, but this one felt like a good fit for this very specific category.
Yeah, it's a tough one because I did have, I was going to have Battle Theme That Rips, FF15 Stand Your Ground. So that was the one I originally had for that category. I was wondering, because I know FF15 is one of the Final Fantasy games that you're fond of, whether this would come up.
I should also point out, the Yoko Shimomura category for piano popping off doesn't have to be her, it just has to be a piano popping off.
Oh, fuck it.
Well, surely you would have picked that anyway, I assume. Or something from, it's a piano absolutely popping off. It's not necessarily by her.
It's like the category is named after her, but it's not the only.
That's funny how I misread that because I could have taken that in a million other directions, but that is fine. I will live by the sword, die by the sword.
Sorry, sorry. No, that's good.
That's good.
Well, I can make that Shimomura category if you want.
No, no, no. You pick whatever you want for it. It's absolutely fine.
I can live with it.
Good. We're off to a good start. So what's your next pick, Matthew?
For RPG, I'll take Persona 5.
Okay.
Again, this one could have been used for like, I mean, the fact is I had this for loads of different categories in tracks. I had it for tracks with vocals, battle theme, boss theme. You know, Persona 5 is a game about what it's like to be with a load of cool teenagers in one of the coolest places in the world, having a mad adventure.
It's proper escapism. And this soundtrack, it completely kind of feeds into that life. It captures the kind of moody, quiet evenings, the demented weirdness of the dungeons, just the heist stakes, nature of the heists, that kind of heist thread running through it.
I really love, I think it's an impossibly trendy soundtrack. Other great Persona soundtracks are available, but I just think this sound is just so rich and like the production on it, it's amazing. It's one of those soundtracks where you're like, if this was a standalone album, you know, the amount of work that had to go into making it, and yet it's like one fraction of this overall game.
And that's something that often strikes with music, is like so many people have to be on top of their game to make good music, which is just one department of a video game. And this soundtrack, when you hear it, you are not some lumpy 30 year old in Bath. You are kind of running around having great time in Tokyo.
Yeah, so I mean, it's funny, because I had just started playing a bit of Persona 3 Reload recently.
Right.
And the opening music of that to the, you know, beautifully animated sort of intro to that game, gave me this powerful feeling of, this reminds me of a place I've never been to. And even though I've never been there, I'm too old for there to be any way to go back. And it was this profound melancholy of like, there's something about the music of Persona that captures so well the idea of being a teenager in this fantastical kind of place.
And then, yeah, I don't know, it's sort of like, it does, I will admit there's an increasingly tragic feeling to playing it the older you get, because you are only further away from it, so yeah.
But I think you will always be allowed in the after school downtime. That's a vibe which is open to people of all ages, mooching around town, not really knowing what to do with yourself. Like, I think you're allowed to feel that as an adult.
What we don't have is the transformation evening where we all become amazing superheroes and our soundtrack becomes much sexier along with it. We don't have that. But I think even in our increasingly old age, I think there's a lot of middle-age vibes within Persona.
Yeah, I mean, it's made by adults, so yeah, that's key.
Like coffee shop music, you know?
Yeah, I kind of see what you mean. I mean, the music is amazing in Persona 5, though, and this is a plum pick. I think it is good to get this off the board.
I had this down for lyrics as well. Like I had this down as the opening theme.
Is that wake up, get up, get out there? Is that one?
Yeah, yeah, that's right. And that's that, in some ways, a lot of the different sort of music hooks in the game come off of that main theme and are sort of extrapolated into their own different sub themes and stuff. And it is brilliant.
The music is just so good at conveying a sense of place, like some of the downtime music, the way that lyrics come in and out of the downtime music. And then just the different versions of boss theme as well and how that escalates is really great. So good at heightening the drama, creating these dramatic peaks in the game.
It's a wonderful game and the music is a massive part of why it works. So that's a good pick, Matthew. No complaints there other than I can no longer pick it and I'm upset.
So those are your two picks. So it's on to me, isn't it? Okay, I guess I have to get something big off the board now for RPG before some of these RPGs get hoovered up in Matthew's track categories for album category one RPG, I'm gonna pick Final Fantasy VII.
So of weighing up the different Final Fantasy games, this is the one that's, I guess, got the mix of iconic sort of like battle themes and sort of like boss themes in different locations with their own sort of like music that kind of like convey a sense of place, whether somewhere is poor or rich or under the cosh of this evil corporation. Music does so much heavy lifting in this game to build out this world. VII is not my personal favorite Final Fantasy, but it's very high as people who listened to last year's Final Fantasy episode will know.
And I do think the music is pretty much great across the board. There are some Final Fancies where they don't quite nail the battle theme as much. I'm not a big Final Fantasy IX battle theme guy, for example, even if some of the other music in that game is great.
But VII, I think, has got pretty much great music for everything, including like, maybe not the fucking MOG minigame thing that you play in that arcade, but things like the bike minigame, for example, absolutely cracking, sort of like, really gets you pumped up for chucking some lads off their motorcycles with the buster sword. It's really, really good, just really kind of amazing undertaking. And it's the first time using, putting music on a CD.
They hadn't done that before. They were only ever used to the Snare sound chip. And when you're playing FF7 Remake or Rebirth, so much of the joy of playing that game is finding out what they've done with this music, how they've used the source material to create something iconic now.
And it all just holds up so, so well. Some days I just pop on the Costa del Sol music and think, oh, imagine I was in Final Fantasy VII's version of Spain right now. That occasionally happens, Matthew.
So what are your thoughts on this one?
Yeah, I mean, it's a great soundtrack. I have to ask, does this eliminate it as a rebirth or remake pick?
I think it has to, in the spirit of the thing. Yeah, I think otherwise it's too much, we're getting too much into technicality territory.
Okay, that saddens me, because I, just because I think the Final Fantasy VII, I much, I thought the rebirth soundtrack is so good. So, so good. Like I actually do prefer the remakes of these tracks.
I fancy the Cosmo Canyon overworld theme from rebirth in the ambient music category, I disagree, which is why I asked, but I can live with it and agree that it's a great soundtrack.
Yeah, that's the thing. And maybe, is it the last time Final Fantasy will come up in this draft? Probably not.
I'm sure it's going to make another appearance at some point.
That was it for me.
Okay, interesting. That's good to know for my overall strategy.
Oh, I should have said that, maybe.
I think it would be gaming it too much to have rebirth and re-waking there, yeah. Okay, well, in any case, that was my second pick, Matthew. So what's your third pick?
I don't think you're going to pick this, but I kind of want to get rid of it just in case, because I really think it is the ultimate pick for this category. For earworm of any description, I'm taking the Wii Shop Channel music.
That's a good pick. That's a good pick.
And now, because I've played a little bit of it, it's gonna be stuck in your head for the next 1000 years. Sorry about that. I do find this piece of music very hard to detach from the incredible YouTube video of those guys singing the different game names to it.
I hum this tune all the time at work. I often sing their lyrics to the tune at work. It drives everyone up the wall.
The way he goes, Panic on Funkatron. That's my favourite bit. Nintendo are the masters of the stealth earworm in these shopping channels, interfaces.
You could probably do a mini draft of Nintendo hardware music, but I do think this one is the king.
It's a good pick because it's a true earworm. It's not attached to any game, but it is a part of the fabric of gaming. And it's exactly the kind of track that some motherfucker will go, I don't care about the rest of the picks.
Matthew picked the Wii Shop music, and that's why I'm voting for him. And that is great strategy. I've got to admit that for those wankers who will do that because of this pick, it's a great choice and well done, frankly.
Shout out to my wankers.
Shout out to my wankers. They should put that in your gravestone. That's beautiful.
Well, we're gonna be talking about my funeral later, so maybe we can throw that in.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so that's a good choice. And that's a real kind of like, see, what I've got is really good, but it's not like that level of sort of iconic, I would say.
It's a much more specific kind of thing. You've picked something that everyone knows and that everyone has had stuck in their head at some point. I feel like Colonel Kurtz where he's like, talking about those kids' arms being sliced off by that guy and he's like the vision, like the majesty of it, like that's me right now, basically.
So yeah, sat in the dark, bold and overweight. That's my energy on this Monday night. So yes, good pick, Matthew.
Well done. I'm genuinely impressed. So free pick, let's take Silent Hill 2 by Akira Yamaoka.
I had quite a few things in free pick. I had Red Dead Redemption, which is an absolutely unbelievable soundtrack by, God, I didn't write that right down the name. So why am I having a go?
Is it like Bill Elm and Woody something or other?
Harrelson. Alan. It's all him on his fucking clarinet.
Where is he, guys?
Or like the Tangerine Dream music in GTA V, but that's been ruined by too much GTA Online loading screens. So I can no longer enjoy that because those, repeating the same kinds of missions over and over again has sapped the joy out of those, even though No Happy Endings is like a fucking amazing GTA V track. So I did have to weigh that up.
But Silent Hill 2's soundtrack is the peak of this series. Yamaoka does amazing work across this series and the soundscape of Silent Hill is, I would say like it's a larger part of this series than any other comparable survival horror experience. Like it's, you know, there's not, the music in Rezzy is not as crucial as the music in Silent Hill is.
It just isn't. It's just so, you know it when you hear it. And you know, the theme of Laura that kicks off the kind of opening FMV of Silent Hill 2 just is so powerful.
It's so like funky, but also sad. And like somehow Yamaoka always does that where they are music that you would dance to live. I've seen him live in Bristol.
It was amazing. Like I can enjoy his music on that level, but it is also at times just harrowing and just really kind of like dreamlike and strange. And it's just so precise.
It's such a distinctive style and it never really feels like it's dated either. It's like, even though there's a little bit of like sort of contemporary sort of, I guess, like indie music that's maybe influencing this or pop music that's influencing his music, it is timeless and there's nothing else that sounds like it. Therefore, I think it's a good pick for this draft, Matthew.
What do you think?
Yeah, so this is, I think this is a great example of a very you pick and maybe the kind of thing I was alluding to where like, I couldn't see myself sitting down for an evening on the sofa and go, well, let's crack out the Silent Hill 2 LP, but it's everything it needs to be the only sort of soundtrack that really makes sense for this game. So, you know, I completely get that. I think people who are looking for a more wide ranging kind of snapshot of all music can be in games, will be very pleased to see that pick on there.
Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, there's just so much amazing music on this. It's not just, it really is like more than just the kind of, like, yeah, funky kind of like elements of the soundtrack.
There's just like music like the promise reprise is just a really sort of like heart wrenching, incredible bit of piano, incredible bit of piano music. It's just music has so many purposes in this game. Yeah.
In a way, it's just used in ways it's not really used in other games. So yeah, maybe it's no Ace Attorney soundtrack, Matthew, but it's, no, it's kind of perfect for my list. It really does embody, I guess, my sensibilities, what I'm interested in.
Loads of other Yamaoka stuff I did consider for this as well for some of the track categories, but this felt like the right overall soundtrack to get off the board. So what's your next pick, Matthew?
I'm going to take something incredibly basic, bitch, and populous, but I do really like it. And I think it is a key part of this game's DNA.
It's the Sonic Heroes opening theme. Let's fucking hear it, guys. Well done.
Just great, great choice.
For theme tune that rips, I'm going to take Uncharted 2 and Drake's Theme.
Annoyingly, this theme appears on a variation in all of the Uncharted games, but the particular kind of orchestral character and kind of richness of this one, I really like. It's a little bit more subdued by the time you get to grumpy Uncharted 4. This is Uncharted 2, where it's unembarrassed just to be full on like, yeah, we're really going for it.
Of the Sony kind of suite of games, it's the soundtrack I like the most. Ties into that kind of love of Indiana Jones and those bigger, broader orchestral soundtracks. Could I maybe have taken an album for this?
I wanted a great theme, and I think that will do.
Yeah, I've weighed up the Uncharted series. I mean, I don't think I'll pick it, but there's a track called New Devon on the Uncharted 4 soundtrack.
Yeah.
Fucking so good that. It's a little bit Pirates of the Caribbean-y, but not nearly as over the top. That's by Henry Jackman.
I think, who did the earlier ones? Was it that Greg Guy?
Yeah.
Did the Firefly soundtrack? Is it Edmondson? Maybe.
Let's just look that up now that I've asked it. Might as well find out. Greg Edmondson, yeah, who did the music to Firefly.
So it was very much the sort of like Joss Whedon strain of pop culture is definitely an influence on Uncharted, isn't it? So you can see how that ended up there. Yeah, Uncharted 2 has great music.
And I think in some ways, I didn't really think about it in the first Uncharted, that is this music great or not? Because the game story, even though I think it's like a fun romp, doesn't necessarily get under your skin. And then I think it Uncharted gradually does get under your skin the more it goes.
And by two, you're just so in on Drake as a character in his kind of journey. I think the music just lifts all those set pieces a little bit more, you know? Yeah.
So I think that's a good choice, Matthew. I like that. Yeah.
Also like it's very, very easy to fill like theme categories with Nintendo characters because they have iconic themes. I'm not skipping out on that because you have a lot of those contained within Smash Brothers. I still think they're valid choices.
They are also just a lot of them are like, they're just a little too kind of played out for me to necessarily like enjoy them.
Yeah. You don't like Toad's house theme, you know, that doesn't still get you.
I like the main Mario Brothers theme. Like when I hear it, I'm not like, whoo, yeah. Like I fucking heard that song so many times.
It means nothing to me anymore. Even though it's a great tune and it captures the character of it, I will react way more to when the 3D Mario composers come in and create some blasting new bit of weirdness.
You know what though, actually, I do agree with you that those hearing them so many times can just sort of make you tune them out a little bit. But I was listening to Simon Parkins podcast and like someone had picked the original Legend of Zelda and hearing that theme kick in, I was like, I hadn't heard it in so long. And you realize that they don't use it in the games anymore.
Yeah.
Like that's, it's gone. It's a bit of an artifact. And so hearing it again in its original form, when I hadn't heard it years and years, actually had like incredible power.
You just stop in the middle of the street and start bawling.
No, I was walking across the bridge to Sainsbury's and-
You can stop on the bridge and start bawling.
I was just like, wow, what a like a powerful sort of like, yeah, what, just what amazing feelings it conjures up. And yeah, but I do also get the idea of picking this. My theme tune, you will never pick for this category, Matthew.
So I knew it was safe. So that can sit on the shelf for a while. Good.
That's fine. But a good choice nonetheless. So onto my next pick then.
So I have been focusing on the albums first, I must admit. And maybe that'll be a mistake when I get to some of the tracks. But there's quite a variety of things that I have been kind of eyeing up for the track category.
So I feel a bit better about picking different stuff for those, whereas for the albums, there are things where I'm like, I need that off the board. So album category eight, 90s as fuck. I'm picking Metal Gear Solid.
So this soundtrack is by Tappy, who was like an in-house Konami composer. This is, I think, still the best Metal Gear Solid soundtrack because the Harry Gregson Williams stuff does have some amazing music on it. Like really, particularly the main Metal Gear Solid score, the way it's brought to life in this orchestral fashion in two and three is really powerful.
But sometimes I think you get into some sort of slightly more generic military thriller music that doesn't really leave much of an impact. Here, all the music is tuned in to the setting in this very specific way, this cold and empty, drafty, echoey place. The music, you can't really tell where the sound design ends and the music begins sometimes.
You wonder if the kind of weird, spooky, kind of wind style or deep roar of something in the distances is baked into the music or whether it's actually part of the game. And it's got this very particular kind of 90s electronic vibe to it, where I think everything is much more of a theme. So it's much more designed to be like, the encounter theme, for example, then you really get in two and three.
You don't really get that in two and three. It's a lot more, it doesn't really intrude on the game experience as much, but I'd argue that here it has more impact because it does intrude on the game experience. So hearing that music is incredible.
Like the way that, just when you're caught and then the music dies down again. And then when you're going through like a high security locations, this is kind of like low, almost John Carpenter-esque, like kind of electro kind of rumble in the background. I think the original Metal Gear Solid has just got such amazing music.
And it is quite 90s. It's got, it's quite tuned into that PS1. It's not really kind of drum and bass, but it's just, it's of a piece with, you know, you're sort of like Ridge Racer and Wipeout soundscapes that were kind of dominating the time.
I think it's kind of like, it's part of that, but it's obviously got this very distinctive identity as well. So for a 90s specific category, Metal Gear Solid feel like it sums it up. And also, I love the series, so it's nice to have it represented.
And you also got the like, Wailing Irish Last music that plays as well. The best is yet to come. That's really, really good on the soundtrack.
So Metal Gear Solid, Matthew, what do you think?
Yeah, I mean, iconic pick, makes complete sense. Metal Gear for me, I think it's been slightly screwed by the selection of tracks that were in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, because I listen to those so much on my PC that they kind of dominate my head when I think about Metal Gear Solid. And I don't know if any of them were from the first game.
There was a really weird selection. Which one is Calling from the Night from? Is that a PSP game?
I don't think that's in the main ones, Calling for the Night and Metal Gear. I don't know that well, actually.
I do like those really big melodramatic, that very distinctive singer who is belting it out and has got a really powerful set of pipes, but isn't a known pop star outside of singing these songs.
I think in Smash Bros, you definitely have the Snake Eater theme, right? That's in there. And then you've got Yell Dead Cell from MGS2.
That's probably the best one in terms of a match for a fighting game. But yes, I can't remember the name of the lady who does the music, actually.
It's the football theme for Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.
Is it Cynthia Harrell? Is that who normally does the music?
Tasha Farrow.
Oh, maybe it varies. But Rika Morinaka always actually composes the songs and writes the lyrics. So, yeah.
Yeah, a musical aesthetic I definitely respond to and enjoy and is 90s as fuck as the category demands.
Absolutely, Matthew. So what's your next pick?
For free pick, I'm gonna take Mario Kart 8. A kart racing game shouldn't have a soundtrack with this many bangers. But the nature of the game, that there are these finite tracks that take about three minutes to do, mean they just have incredible fun with them.
They always do that thing where you hit the last lap and then the music kind of escalates wildly. It gives them a structure they can have a huge amount of fun with. It's a mix of classic themes, radically redone, very sunny, big band, jazzy feel.
This is 100% what I was talking about of just loads of people jamming out and having a good old time straight away from the trumpets of the main theme to like Mad Dash of the Wario Mountain, the N64 Rainbow Road, which are considered for a funeral track. Because there was a meme, well, it wasn't really a meme video. I don't think it was widespread enough to be a meme, but there was a YouTube video back in the NGamer days of a guy singing a song to the original tune of Rainbow Road about his uncle dying and going to heaven.
And it was like Rainbow Road as heaven. And I find it quite hard to remove Rainbow Road from the idea of it being like the road to heaven now. So yes, but N64 Rainbow Road cover.
I can only describe it as like 80s quiz show theme guitar. I don't really know what's going on instrumentally, but it sounds like the theme tune to like catchphrase or something except epic. And that's a really great track.
So yes, Mario Kart 8.
So it's a good choice and not something I would have picked. So yeah, I think it's, I feel like I've ticked off my Nintendo soundscape kind of like entry with Smash Bros, but there's definitely a very, very, very, very specific vibe to the Mario Kart music. It is, it drills into your brain.
It does, yeah, conjures up certain feelings of sort of like stress and delight that are very particular to that series. Yeah, really, really good.
Getting that game on, you're instantly like fucking, yes, I am so happy I spent 50 quid on this. Let me go and buy another 10 copies so that this game may sell 70 million copies by the end of the Switch's lifespan.
And they'll never make another one.
Well, no, they don't ever have to make another one because they've made, I mean, they've certainly made the funkiest Mario Kart soundtrack of all time. And it may sound like recency bias, but like they just have got better at making these fucking amazing soundtracks. And it's a tough break for the earlier Nintendo games.
Yeah, okay. That's a good choice, Matthew. You're also sort of like all in on Mario Kart 8 from the Wii U days as well.
Like you've been repping this soundtrack for like years and years.
Oh yeah, but it's always been like a solid, this is like an edge 10 soundtrack to me. But then this is what I want all games. This is what I think games should sound like.
You know, this is just pure joy. Yeah, but it's not for everyone. It's very different to like, the person who likes this soundtrack and the person who's gonna really vibe with Silent Hill 2, very different people.
Yes, Samuel Roberts and Matthew Castle basically. Those are the different people in question. Okay, so next category, we're gonna take another album.
So album category five, game soundtrack where music plays a key role in the gameplay. I'm gonna take Osu! Tatekei Uenden.
So we'll allow this, Matthew, even though it's technically licensed music. I think that's probably okay.
Yeah, I would have let you take fucking Beatles rock band if you wanted.
No, that's okay. I love She's Leaving Home, but I don't necessarily need it in this draft. So people know how good the Beatles are.
So this is an interesting category because obviously rhythm action games are kind of like the way that we're thinking here, or mostly the way that we're thinking. I thought about, could you get away with putting the Vice City soundtrack here? I don't think you can because it is just licensed music.
The thing is, it's a key part of the world. I don't know if it's a key part of the gameplay. Gameplay is a very specific thing, isn't it?
Yeah, well, we'll see when I get to my peak for this how generous you're feeling.
So this is obviously like a DS game where you are tapping along, basically tapping drums along to a variety of like J-pop hits. I don't even know if they're hits, but to a Western audience, this is music that is associated with this game. It's music that is so distinctive and almost feels like it is made for this kind of like particular rhythm, action, experience.
And at the same time, you're getting all this kind of like these short stories that are playing out at the same time while you're enjoying the music. And then your experience with the Wendon is that you play through it all once and you go back on the higher difficulties and you are tapping more and more and more until the bottom DS screen is taking so much physical damage from the way that you're playing. It's really something.
And I played loads of Elite Beat Agents, but when we did the Diestra, I finally imported this in a sequel and it's just, it is night and day. It is just that it's proper example of how the right music will just elevate it further. Like this is, a Wendon's like a nine, I think, and the Elite Beat Agents is a seven.
I think the difference is just having the music, this particular music. So that feels like a good pick and there's other stuff. I was thinking a little bit along the lines of the kind of like res sort of soundtracks and stuff like that, but I don't love the music to res.
I just think the music can res is great at doing what it does in terms of, it feels like you're inside a fucking computer, which is what it's supposed to do. But I don't love it as such. Whereas I think the music in a Wendon is delightful and therefore a good pick.
Thoughts Matthew?
I wonder if like this game is a lot of people's entry or like gateway drug into like J-pop and then K-pop and things like that. Cause it just feels like I hadn't really heard a lot of this stuff before this game. Can't argue with it.
They're all good picks. You'd have to go some to pick bad games for this list, I think.
I think that is true. Yeah. It's sort of like the subjectivity is how you feel about the music itself, but all the games are bangers.
What's your next pick, Matthew?
I always want to just pick a track so that we have a socks. We're only playing music when we pick a track. So I feel like inclined to take a track and ensure we actually hear something.
You think I'm not doing that and I've shirked my responsibility as a podcaster.
No, I'm just thinking, you know, like it feels like we've gone a little while. We had a few album picks. I just know you're not going to pick half these things.
So there's like no point getting them early. I want to end strong. I don't want to end with something rotten.
The why I'm basically, like just to be, you know, fully transparent about this, currently my legs are like desperately paddling under the water trying to find a fucking fighting game that I don't hate or that its best tracks aren't already in Smash Brothers. Like I really, I just, I knew it was important. I don't know.
I didn't take it. Well, I didn't take it because I didn't get to go first, but I, I just didn't realize how important it was going to be very annoying. And now I've done this whole bit.
Whatever I pick for that is obvious that I don't care about it. So when I'm like, well, of course, it's got to be Tekken 3. Everyone's going to be like, fuck off.
You hate Tekken. You just pick back so you didn't have anything else. And that is true.
Oh, lots to dissect there.
I don't think you're going to take it, but I've got to get it off the board. Platform Super Mario Galaxy. Picking any of the 3D Mario stuff because they're all pretty amazing.
They all do their own thing. I think Super Mario Galaxy ushers in the new era of 3D Mario sound and kind of lays out what is going to work for these games moving forwards. It has Gusty Garden Galaxy.
One of the five greatest bits of video game music of all time. Another contender for my funeral. I'm removing funeral tracks as we go and just praying that what I've got left is left for me.
Mario Galaxy, Mario Galaxy 2. I have very hard to pick between those. I think Gusty Garden Galaxy is just a little bit better.
The way this soundtrack moves between all the different worlds, finds all these different kind of characteristics to draw for them, but unites some of this big sort of rich orchestral sound and a little bit of synthy space weirdness. I think it's so fun. Playing this for review.
I mean, I listen to the soundtrack all the time, like away from the game, but playing this for review, like my process became like not what am I going to see next, but what am I going to hear next? And each level just blasting you in with some mega tune and sitting in this room going, I wish there were other people here that I could like talk to about this. I think it's a, it's just a truly excellent soundtrack and a really, really important soundtrack to me and a really important game to me.
So, you know, I just, you're not going to take it, I don't think, or you'll probably take a later Mari if you're going to take one at all. Maybe you'll be a sicko and take a Sonic, but you know, that's fair enough.
Yeah, fair enough. Definitely again, that thing of, you know, there's a different setting aspect to Mari Galaxy that was not seen in any other Mari game. And so what it does to make Mari feel galactic is amazing in this.
I wouldn't personally listen to any of this outside of the game. That's not the kind of experience I have with Mari music. It's very much a kind of like, I appreciate it in Simpatico with the game itself.
That's, again, that's not a diss. The music's great. You know, and some of it's even in the Smash Bros soundtrack.
No, no, it's a great pick and I think it's, you know, it's a very you pick as well. I'm not enough of a shite lord to try and take merry galaxies off you, Matthew. That's not why I'm here.
So that was the we draft where I was trying to do that. Yeah, so I think it's a good choice. And you know, you did eventually get that person to enjoy the music in the room with you.
Her name is Catherine Castle. So that's very delightful, I think. Good choice, good choice.
And I'm honestly not being patronising with that. I think it's a good choice.
I know it's a good choice. It's one of the top five soundtracks of all time. I'm happy to have it on my list.
Time for me to pick a track category. So track category 10, the game over category. This will play at my funeral.
And end once and for all by Clint Mansell from the Mass Effect 3 soundtrack.
Do you know this piece of music, Matthew?
I don't know, I must have heard it, but I couldn't hum it.
Do, do, I can't really do it on the podcast.
Was that actually an attempt? Cause that sounded jaunty for a funeral.
No, that was like the jaunty version. No, it's a very sort of like forlorn bit of music that kind of encapsulates the end of Mass Effect as a thing. Like if it's been a part, if it was a part of your life and you were tuned into Mass Effect over those kind of like five years between when the first and third game came out, 2007 to 2012.
This did feel like the, this is it, you're saying goodbye to all your friends on the Normandy kind of vibe to it. And it's a really great bit of music. When they redid the ending slightly to appease all those babies who are a canary in the coal mine for gamergate shit coming down the line years later, they actually did an extended version of this, which is also very, very good.
But I think this just really lands. This is my favorite bit of music from the Mass Effect soundtrack. And I think everyone, I think if people are going to name a piece of music from the series, this is probably what comes to mind.
But I guess for funeral music, it's an ironic funeral music. It's very straightforward, I guess. This is a great sad bit of music, I guess.
So it felt like the right pick in that respect, Matthew. When people hear the bit of music in the episode, they'll definitely remember what this is if they finish Mass Effect 3.
And there's a picture of you in a box.
Yeah, and yes, my mom looking sad. Actually, that's quite a bleak image, isn't it? I'm supposed to die later.
Anyway, so lots to think about there. What's your next pick?
If a game soundtrack where music plays a key role in the gameplay, I would like to make the case for Tetris Effect.
Yeah, I'll allow it.
It's part of its whole synesthesia thing. It's all getting you into that flow state and the music's there, the way it ups the ante when you go into the special Tetris zone. I feel like if you feel like that's too detached from the rhythm, I'm happy to swap it out for something else.
No, it's fine. It's all good. I think this comes under the O'Wendon rule, where it's technically like it uses some licensed music.
Is that right? But it's how it uses it.
I don't have a problem with that.
I think that's fine.
Cool. Amazing soundtrack, I'd probably play this more just to listen to the soundtrack and set it to super easy. Like, I'm not there to have a super intense time or prove the Tetris skills that I simply do not possess.
So booting this up and I think the song's up is a group called Hydelic or Hydelic, but that central theme connected brackets yours forever. I could listen to that on an endless loop and I have playing Tetris Effect as another track, Always Been But Never Dreamed, which is really good. This sort of slightly sort of ethereal lady singing in the background of just something with a nice sort of thumping rhythm to kind of get you into the flow with the Tetris dropping.
I mean, this is their whole thing. Oh, I've completely forgotten the name of the studio.
Mizuguchi.
Yeah, the whole vibe. I mean, a lot of his games, if you pick them, the reason you probably love them is the soundtrack, first and foremost. Yeah, this one I just, I find especially dreamy.
And some of the tracks that are in the album does contain some slightly spicier ones, which I think are there just to like fuck you up and upset you after you've been having a nice chill time so that the campaign doesn't feel too one note. It can't all be kind of space dolphins jumping around. Sometimes it needs to be one of the fiery levels where it plays nightmarish urban soundscape or something.
But Tetris Effect, a truly, truly great selection of tracks and definitely an album you can listen to away from the game as I often do.
Yeah, so Tetsuya Mizuguchi is bound to come up in this draft, Enhance Games is his outfit, I believe. And yeah, I actually think that if I had Tetris Effect in VR during the pandemic, it would have cured all my mental health challenges that I had at that time. I think it's, because when I subsequently got the Quest version and played it, I just thought it was such an amazing VR thing to experience.
Just so, so good to play that on standalone VR is just one of the great joys of owning a headset, I would say, it's something everyone should experience to just see how powerful VR can be because yeah, the way the music and images work in tandem in this game is great, really, really good. So yeah, great pick, Matthew, no contention with that.
Thank you.
Good stuff, yeah. Okay, so for track category three, earworm of any description, I'm going to take Friday Night from the Yakuza Zero soundtrack.
So, how best to describe this? There's just a guy saying, it's Friday night, and it's become a kind of like very widely appreciated meme. There is a popular Twitter account that just posts this with the two main characters, Kiryu and Majima, dancing along to this.
Could have gone under features lyrics, I suppose, but this is something that really got in my head when I was playing the game. Is it linked to the sort of like the disco location in the game, Matthew? Is there some kind of like management element that maybe this feeds into or something like that?
I can't actually remember how it comes into the game itself.
I thought it was just one of the mini games.
Is that what it is? Is it just like you're dancing? Is that all it?
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, so that's, it actually plays quite a minor role, but I think it's come to sort of like define the soundscape of Yakuza 0 specifically and like to a lot of people, this is kind of how I think they know what Yakuza is. And I just love it.
And I think it really does stick in your head. And it is, if it is Friday and it does come on, I will say it's intensely joyful to listen to. So a good pick, you know, it's a very different vibe to the Wii Store music.
If I think it jams in your brain, just all the same. And yeah, I think again, it's nice to represent this series here.
I was trying to find a kind of way into the Yakuza series. I didn't really think about the sort of mini game or the karaoke stuff. That's quite a fun way to talk about it in the tracks.
Is it wrong to say a lot of the main music sort of blurs into just sort of angry music to thump men by? This is a really nice targeted track.
Yeah, exactly. I think it's the right, the lateral way you kind of got to approach it. So yeah.
Okay, so yes, it has 3.9 million views on YouTube. Oh, in fact, it has 10 million views on YouTube. So clearly it has struck a chord, this particular thing.
Certified banger.
Certified banger. What is your next pick, Matthew?
Fighting games. I assume we're talking specifically about one-on-one fighting games and not brawlers. Yeah.
Okay.
You can't really do side scrolling beat-em-up, so it's not a fighting game.
It's annoying, isn't it? I may not pick anything for it because I literally would have nothing.
Wait, I was going to put he abstained.
I might abstain on the grounds of fucking pointless, isn't it?
That's good in the spirit of the draft, isn't it? Not taking it too seriously there, enjoying it.
Fight eyes, like...
I'd feel the same if I was you, actually. I did think this was the one pick that had to come off the board.
You have to pretend you like street fighting music and you don't, you know?
I had Tekken 4 as my backup because I really love some of the music in that game, but Smash Bros. Ultimate is just all-encompassing, isn't it? It's tricky.
Yeah, I'll find a way in. For Bleep Bloop, retro game soundtrack, 16-bit or earlier, I will take Legend of Zelda Link to the Past. While I did say I like listening to older music kind of reimagined and, you know, I've definitely heard some amazing orchestral covers of tracks from Link to the Past, the sound of this music is tied so specifically to the noise the SNES makes and the SNES sound chip can make.
It has such a particular kind of character to it. A lot of these tunes don't really kind of come up anywhere else. Like there are, you know, there's obviously there's lots of motifs that kind of return across the series, but this has always felt like quite like an isolated soundtrack within it.
You know, the overworld theme, the dark world theme, just the stressful music of the castle at the start. It's a real kind of time and place soundtrack for me. There are a hundred different things you could pick for this.
Quite tempted by Mother and Earthbound, just because they have such an oddness to them and feel like they're already trying to do something a little bit more experimental outside of the kind of style of the time. But Link to the Past, if only for being one of the first soundtracks that I can really remember.
Yeah, really good choice. Obviously like a Hall of Fame soundtrack. And yeah, I think, you know, most of the themes I enjoy in Link's Awakening could probably have some origins in this because Link's Awakening started as a port of Link to the Past.
So yeah, good choice, Matthew. Yeah, like a really solid pick to have in that stock of albums. You just need to rack up the classics and in those categories, don't you?
So yeah.
Yeah, it's got to rack up the classics. And maybe if I really rack them up, I might have 10% of the classics that appear in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. Yeah, okay.
All right. So my next pick then, I think I'll take Bleep Bleep Retro Game Soundtrack as well. So album category seven.
I'm going to take Chrono Trigger. So yeah, this was my first pick for this one. I did do my research to appease the Sega heads and listened to the Outrun soundtrack today.
And I'll be honest, I do prefer the Chrono Trigger soundtrack. It's absolutely amazing. So Matt Suda doing his thing and has to convey, you know, like I think six different timeframes basically from apocalyptic far future to, you know, literally dinosaur times in the past.
And, you know, art does an amazing job of conveying that in the game. Like there's so much art in this game. It's a real kind of like amazing collaboration between different RPG masterminds.
But the music is a crucial part of that as well. It's like really dramatic, it's really sad. It has great battle themes, but great sort of like character themes as well.
It's got like basically Rick Astley in it too. Robo's theme is basically never gonna give you up. It's got rad futuristic bike chase music.
It's got this great track called Corridors of Time, which is just really kind of like mournful piece of music that encompasses the overall odd melancholy at the heart of this game. The idea of like time being beyond your control. And you're on this kind of like journey to correct things, but it feels like such an insurmountable task.
And you see, you know, so much unhappy stuff happen in that journey of like places being destroyed and things going wrong and things like that. And Corridors of Time is just so, so powerful at conveying the, yeah, that odd darkness at the heart of the story. I think this music is absolutely amazing.
So even compared to the, you know, like the Final Fantasy soundtracks from the time, I think Chrono Trigger is just a few steps ahead. So yeah, Yasunori Misuda absolutely fucking knocks out the park with this. What's your next pick?
Overworld theme. I've called it Overworld theme. I know that's not the category.
Ambient world theme. The music that plays when you're outside of a battle in an RPG basically is how I took this. I'm taking from Xenoblade Chronicles 2, a track you will definitely not know called More or Ardane, Roaming the Wastes.
More Ardane is like the imperialist city that you visit in Xenoblade 2, and yet for some reason, they give it this huge brass band track that you will have just heard a little snippet of. It's hilarious to me that this giant military power is represented by this quite kind of flouncy like marching band sound, sort of small town America marching band, just really joyful over the top. Xenoblade for my money, the whole series is just the king of overworld themes.
Like a big part of why I like these games and why I can play them for 150 hours is that to be in their world, is just to be bombarded with these epic tunes. And it was a real wrestle between all three games, but this particular tune, I just think is so grand. You may not be familiar with it.
Hopefully that little snippet you've just heard, you'll want to go and listen to the whole soundtrack, because it is banger after banger, and then they have like day versions and night versions, and so you can kind of hear them morph between, and that's really fun. It is, you just got to take my word for it. This is a good one.
Yep, and when I listen back to this episode, I will hear a snippet and I'll be like, yeah, that was a good one. So yeah, I think that's, yeah, that kind of makes sense. I did wonder when this series would come up on this podcast, so that makes sense.
Wait, you've not picked one already, have you?
No, no, I thought about Xenoblade Chronicles one just because it establishes the rules of what those games are gonna be and what those soundtracks are gonna be and the kind of collaboration behind them. Tempted for RPG, but just the funkiness and say it quietly, the wide popularity of Persona 5 helped it win out. If I pick Xenoblade Chronicles, I guarantee one vote from Balladeer on the Discord.
That's it. That's the only person I win over. Persona 5, I can think of 10 people who'll like that.
Do you remember though, Balladeer, that I have picked the Smash Bros Ultimate soundtrack and think of all your favorites that are in there.
Well, we can't believe we're giving this much time. Are we gonna go through each listener one by one and make the case to them?
Definitely not, I already regret doing this, so that's fine. Okay, I think I'm gonna copy you and pick this category as well, Matthew. So track category five, Ambient Open World or World Map Music.
I'm picking Field Day from the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild soundtrack.
I think this, again, like the good sort of like sunny, amazing, open world vibes of this game, the first time you experience it, and just, you know, kind of like getting to grips of how it works and its rules and that sort of thing. This music is kind of like the, other than the sort of like the very distinctive tower theme that you hear when you're climbing a tower in this game, like it's basically just, this is the soundtrack of what you'll hear when things are not going wrong. It's just, it sounds like nature, it sounds sunny, it sounds pleasant, it's nice out there.
There's a tiny little music, sort of like note in it that sounds like it's gonna be the sort of like blood moon music, but it's not quite, it's not quite, it always feels like it's deliberate to make you think it's about to happen or something. That's cool. But it's, yeah, it's just really great.
When you listen to this, I think it just embodies what Breath of the Wild is and what its appeal is. And yeah, and I think it makes sense to represent Zelda somewhere on this list, even if it's one of the newer ones, Matthew.
A really subtle soundtrack. It's kind of hard to get it into a lot of the categories because it never really rips. It's too kind of grown up for that.
But like you say, it's trying to capture what is the kind of ambient sound of nature or the wind. And that sort of kind of like trembling kind of piano that they used to bring that to life. There are a few enemy and boss themes which are a bit livelier, but yeah, it's an absolute banger.
So I think it's a masterpiece of a soundtrack. But I did find it quite hard to like work out where to cram it in here.
Yeah, I think this is the one that makes the most sense because, you know, the world, the overworld is what you're experiencing. And it's the primary source of your joy in that game, I think. Yeah, when you hear this, you'll be like, oh yeah, that is what being in that world sounds like, even if it is subtle, let you say.
What's your next pick, Matthew?
Bit of a goofy one, but for features, lyrics, I'm going to take Bayonetta 2 Moon River.
Great pick, been weighing up Bayonetta myself. Slightly more of a Fly Me To The Moon guy myself. But I think this is also great.
I think I just like the song Moon River a bit more, and it's so lively. I don't even really remember where it plays in the game. I think is it like the opening battle?
Yeah, I thought it was like throughout the game, but it's actually just the first few opening chapters.
Yeah, because I was quite tempted by Tomorrow Is Mine, which is like the original battle theme for Bayonetta 2, which also has lyrics. But I just love the sound of Moon River. I think the way they kind of blow it out, it's everything that's sort of great about Bayonetta.
There's like a kind of stylishness to it in the kind of the original choice of song, but then it's kind of blown out into this big, brassy, exciting, fast thing. And I think Bayonetta 2, you know, we're not going to relitigate the Bayonetta rankings here.
Definitely not.
But I do think the Bayonetta 2 soundtrack is electric throughout. And I'm really confident that when you hear a little 15 second bursts of this, it'll put, it'll kind of cheer you up.
I like it because it's, is it most famous of being Breath of Sir Tiffany's, this track?
Is that kind of what it's... That sounds right, I can't say, but I know for sure.
Just because I think it's just, that's such a, I mean, it's a really dated film in a few ways, but it's like a very romantic film. And I think there's a, I think the romanticism of that music does carry across to this version still. It's a little bit, it's like, it is joyful, but it's a tiny bit melancholy as well, I think, just because it's built into the nature of the song.
I think it's-
Yeah, I get that.
Yeah, and that's why I think it's great. I'm not having a go, Matthew, I'm bracing it for you.
No, no, no, I think that's right. I'm just not very eloquent at talking about it as a song. There's something slightly grown up, or something sophisticated about it anyway.
And I find that marriage of that and the kind of the past, the mad platinum past they've done on it just to be very, very appealing.
I'm going to take for Boss Theme That Rips, track category eight. I'm gonna take Taking On The Shaggo Hod from Metal Gear Solid 3.
It sounds like, when you said that, in my head, I was like, taking on the Shagahod. I was thinking of it as like putting on the ritz. It's an old timey song, taking on the Shagahod.
I think it is actually like, it does actually have the apostrophe, and loses a G, I think, on the official track listing, which is why I called it taking on the Shagahod in that way, I believe so anyway. This is a banger from the MGS3 soundtrack. Like I say, I think that the original MGS, the music is a bit more intrusive and part of the experience, but I think this is just a great theme of like, here's Volgins in a fucking nuclear tank, we gotta blow this to shit up, and the music just gets you so, so pumped.
It's like a classic Metal Gear theme, I think, and just hearing the clatter of the Shagahod taking sort of like rocket fire to the sides and Volgins screaming while this is going off. You feel like you're getting the upper hand on him, and it just really amps things up. Music has to play a really key part in the finale of MGS3 because it's actually a succession of big moments.
There's loads and loads of dramatic peaks at the end, so it's quite easy. It'd be quite easy for one to dip and for you to drop off, but the music's great at keeping the momentum as you're being chased across an airfield and fighting Volgins one-on-one, and blowing up the Shagahod and then going through a forest and fighting the boss and escaping and then Ocelot jumps on the plane. There's just so much that happens in that finale and the music helps you make sense of it.
And yeah, but just because a lot of that other music is quite sad or, you know, we obviously know where the MGS3 story ends, it is a sad story. This is like one last burst of isn't it fucking rad that you're blowing up a big robot and it just really works. So what's the next pick?
For 90s as fuck, I will take Ridge Racer Type 4.
That was my backup pick, good choice.
To my ear, you know, it sort of sits in the same musical world as like a sort of persona, sort of slightly kind of, is it like acid jazz kind of vibes, but like slightly naffa, but in a kind of pleasing way. I love that the title theme is a lady singing Ridge Racer over and over again, like that's just, it's just like a nonsense thing to have to sing and to come into a studio and do, which really like throws yourself into it. This whole soundtrack is, you know, it's very much like a vibes based selection of music, but it makes perfect sense in the game with all these like sort of minimalist menus and it's kind of sort of driving round these sort of weirdly empty kind of urban landscapes, but also in isolation.
You know, I think that's the thing you were saying about like the kind of traditions Metal Gear was drawing on. I think this is like game music in conversation with like more popular forms of music and because of that can maybe like stand away from the games a bit more.
It's great. It's really amazing to listen to by itself as well. You know, I have had this soundtrack on while I've just been working.
Like you, I discovered the joys of this when we did that PS1 draft. I had heard that the music in this was like particularly great even for this generation of Namco game, which has loads of great music. This is amazing.
There's so much about the presentation of that game around the edges that makes it as great as it is. Yeah, it just captures the PS1 sound in this very, yeah, it's like this perfect lightning in a bottle soundtrack, I think. So really good choice.
Okay, my next pick then. For album category four, platformer, I'm gonna take Sonic CD because of course I am. So yes, this music is so incredible.
This was a recent-ish discovery. I did play the Sonic Gems collection in the noughties that had this game on it, but only played a couple of levels, thought it was good. And then in the pandemic when we did our Sonic episode, I properly, properly got into it.
It was such a blast to play through. I don't think it's the best Sonic game as we've discussed before, but the idea of having three different bits of music to represent time travel is so, so good. And it really is like this music you can imagine playing in a Japanese nightclub in the early nineties.
It's just really credible and great. If you heard this music without knowing it's in a Sonic game, I don't think you would guess it's in a Sonic game. Sometimes it's a little bit cuter, but other times it's just like, this sounds like I'm running through a cyberpunk metropolis or something.
It's just an amazing kind of combination of sounds. It's also just that thing of like a soundtrack specifically made for a piece of hardware where the music was a huge advantage of why the hardware even existed. So, you know, like the Mega CD or the Sega CD, whatever.
If you own this, then, you know, the Sonic CD was one of the obvious sort of like killer apps, but it's just the fact that they didn't put that technology to waste. Like to look at Sonic CD is, you know, pretty much in line with the other Mega Drive games, but to hear it is where the distinction comes. And the different versions of Palm Tree Panic, they're all just incredible.
And like the, just the fact that like, as you get deeper into it as well, some of the music just gets really strange. This is operatic, sort of like Dr. Robotnik theme. This is like literally like a woman, sort of like, you know, like wailing kind of opera style.
It's just so ridiculously dramatic. There's a tiny bit of like one winged angel vibes about it. It's like, and it's just fucking Eggman and his little robot contraption.
It's just really ridiculous. And then obviously like the sort of like main theme as well, which is you can do anything. I think that maybe is a different one, depending on which territory you're in.
There's a lot of that with this. But the original Sega Sound Team version of the soundtrack is the one, Dog. I'm guessing you don't really have any strong thoughts in seeing the way, Matthew.
No, I don't know this one. I do know that I like 2D Sonic music in a way that I just don't care for the 3D Sonic music. And when we played Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast, it was like, so much of this is instantly taking everything in a direction I just do not care for, where even I, not the biggest 2D Sonic fan in the world, like those tunes are just iconic, iconic bangers and they're as closely tied to that Mega Drive sound as Link to the Past is the snares.
And you'd have to be a real fucking contrarian to pretend that those aren't great tracks.
Yeah, and I would say that for people who kind of want a little taste of why this is good, then I would just listen to the tracks Little Planet and the four different variants of Palm Tree Panic, just to get an idea of the different contrasts between them, how they are built on like the same few notes, but they are interpreted in completely different ways. And again, that being a kind of a way to convey that the level before you is just completely changed in color palette and layout, because again, that's one of the other magic tricks of this game. So yeah, Sonic CD felt like the right pick for me and Platformer and knowing that I have lots of other music covered off and Smash Bros is previously established, so that's fine.
What's your next pick Matthew?
My next pick, let's get a fighting game off the table because it's sitting there like a thorn in my paw and I just don't want it hanging over me. So I'm going to rip the bandage off. I'm really confusing my medical ailment there.
I'm going to pick the little loved, but agreed by the community that it's soundtrack is a banger that I'd completely forgotten about until it suddenly came to me. I'm going to pick the not very good Wii fighting game, Castlevania Judgment.
Interesting, I know nothing of this soundtrack.
This, well, I mean, the game is all the characters from Castlevania in a 2D fighting game, which I believe is considered to be dogshit. Certainly NGamer kicked its face off, but what it does have is a soundtrack of Castlevania themes from across the series rendered in not an orchestral style, like the kind of rocky Castlevania style that often gets played at like those video games live concerts. These are tracks that translate very well into that style.
And you can hear from the way I'm talking about it that I am in very uneasy territory with this. Big guitar music isn't really my cup of tea, but I do love Castlevania themes. And I was kicking myself that I hadn't found a way of getting Castlevania in here because there's a lot of just debate about how to, you know, which game has the most music that you want.
And the one thing that did keep coming up was the Castlevania judgment has, you know, does for Castlevania specifically kind of what Smash Brothers does in terms of taking them and lovingly reworking them and making them big, making them feel massively produced. So if you want your bloody tears and your vampire killer and your Simon's theme and all this, they are all accounted for. And Castlevania has got a very specific sound that I'm pleased to have represented in my list.
Well, that's a good choice. You can only really counterpick to Smash Bros. And I think that to take a load of Castlevania tunes that people like is a good counterpick.
So yeah, it makes sense to me. I'm glad you didn't abstain in this category.
If I hadn't have thought of that, I would have abstained.
That would have just been too sad, I think, to abstain in this category.
I literally couldn't, like, everyone at work say, I discuss this at work, like, hypothetically.
The committee, the committee.
No, I was like, I trust, does this sound like the work of our man with a committee behind him? Come on. But a lot of them, obviously, being PlayStation heads, they're all like, oh, well, you're obviously going to have Tekken in there.
And then they started listing his Tekken tracks. And it is just a series that means nothing to me. And I'm like, I couldn't, I couldn't blag my way through Tekken.
Like, I couldn't, I don't think I can name, like, there's a bear in it. It's that level of idiocy when it comes to Tekken with me.
Thank you for establishing why you don't like Tekken. That's useful information for this draft. So, all right, so I'm glad you picked something either way.
So, track category seven. I'm gonna take the Yoko Shimomura category for piano absolutely popping off, but doesn't have to be composed by Shimomura as a previously established. I'm gonna take one final effort from the Halo 3 soundtrack.
Thank AKA the music that I think plays both when the two scarabs drop from the sky, but also plays as you're escaping. I think it plays also as you're escaping on the collapsing platforms in the Warthog at the end. It's a proper sort of like, kind of like Weaves In classic, the classic sort of Halo theme, but it's just a piano going absolutely apeshit.
It's really just the most like, fuck yeah, let's, like, kind of like positive battle music. It's really, really so, so good. And Halo's got great soundtracks generally, but I actually do think that on each album, I can pinpoint like one track that sums up why I love that soundtrack and don't necessarily listen to the whole thing.
So for Reach, for example, I thought about Tip Of The Spear, which is an unbelievably good bit of music. But one final effort is Halo. When you hear the very particular sort of like, bit of piano music playing before you listen to me rambling about it, I think you'll really get, it'll really remind you of why this was so effective.
So yeah, Halo Matthew. I know how you feel about that. What's your next pick?
My favorite Shimomura soundtrack, Halo 3.
Can you tell we've been recording for more than two hours?
Oh yeah, we've reached that. Indie game, to category two of albums, to show that I also appreciate smaller subtleties. I'll take Outer Wilds.
Oh, great choice.
With its blue grassy infused group of musicians sitting around a campfire playing songs that echo across the galaxy. Music plays a big role in this game in terms of giving you your bearings and drawing you to these musicians who are over the course of the game, Mild Spider Alert, sort of united to bring their tune together. So it ends on quite a profound musical note.
It's something this game builds to. I also really like the mournful synth that plays right at the death of the universe just before time resets. It's not a, you can make it, you can squeeze something in.
It's a, well, you better put down tools and like, let's all look at the sun kind of engulfing us all together. And I, you know, trying to create a tune which captures that vibe, I imagine must be quite a challenge, but yeah, the composer pulls it off.
Yeah, gotta say, I do, you know, I love the sort of music that plays that one guy playing his guitar, when you sort of, you look at him with your little telescope thing.
Yeah.
There he is, doing his thing. The way it uses sounds to like tease out different bits of the universe is, or the bits of the, sorry, the system is really, really nicely done. So yeah, indie game, you know, indie game soundtrack draft could have been its own, probably quite a popular episode of this podcast.
It's really just, you know, it's so rich. And it's hard to boil it down to one pick. So that's probably where we let game music down the most.
This is not much indie representation here, and there's so much going on musically and in the indie game scene. So a good pick, Matthew. I like it.
Thank you.
Okay, so for track category six, rhythm, action, favorite, I'm going to take legendary theme from Guitaruman.
Oh, Guitar Man is a great game, great little rhythm action game, a Koei game that I don't think has any other, this other than a PSP port, there's no other game before or after it, but it's like, I think it's like an, they said, Ironist game, actually, that's where it's from. I'm completely forgetting that's where it's origins are. And it is basically like a young boy who becomes a superhero with a guitar, does battle, I think, with aliens, but in any case, it's basically just a series of like, you know, him playing guitar in public and battling someone or, you know, wooing his girlfriend or whatever.
And legendary theme recurs throughout the game. It's a really nice, just little simple bit of music. It's just like, do, do.
It's just really simple. And it's, because it comes up a few times, I think it means it sort of like hits when it does return. Just create some really nice moments throughout.
It's a piece of music that everyone remembers from this game, but all the music in this game is fantastic. It's just an absolute PS2 classic. Thought about picking it for the cult favourite category in albums, but legendary theme does boil it down nicely.
So yeah, I'm sure the little bit of music that plays before this will help make my case. What's your next pick, Matthew?
My next pick is for Shooter, FPS or otherwise. I believe this counts as an album. I'd like to take the soundtrack to Kid Icarus Uprising.
Do we accept?
Yes, sorry. I paused for getting this is not a track category. Yeah, of course.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, just scrolling Shooter and then an on foot Shooter. Kid Icarus Uprising is again, in the same way that Smash Brothers is Sakurai going, let me get together all these rad composers to do their covers of amazing Nintendo tracks, including some Kid Icarus tracks. Kid Icarus Uprising is that same process, but just for Kid Icarus, which may make it sound very limited or overly specific, but I think Kid Icarus does have one of the weirder NES soundtracks.
It's got a lot of very memorable tunes. Certainly the artists who've been brought in to work on this game have had just a field day with it and blown some of these tracks out into like, the dark pit theme is kind of played. It sounds like a sort of Spanish, sort of flamenco type thing.
It's really sort of nimble and then there's huge orchestral sounds. And what always amazed me about this soundtrack was that it was for a 3DS game. Like this is a big TV soundtrack coming out of a handheld.
It's kind of perverse. I listen to it all the time. I think it's just an immense treasure trove of music.
I really hope that they do remaster this or remake this or whatever for Switch or the Switch successor at some point, just because I feel like it's a soundtrack more people need to get to know because it's really ambitious and just excellent, excellent stuff.
Yeah, you know, this music really makes me think about having a sore wrist as I try and play this game. No, it's great music. And I think it underlines that thing we've talked about whenever we discuss this game, of this being a proper blockbuster 3DS experience.
In this way, that's almost like conventional for a HD console, but not necessarily Nintendo. It's a Sakurai game through and through in terms of how it works. But the approach to set piece design in this and how exciting it is, it feels like there's a little bit of a kind of Western-y sensibility to it.
I think Western blockbuster sensibility to it, relatively speaking for a Nintendo game.
Yeah.
Yeah, and music really sums it up. So it's a good choice, Matthew. I like that.
And very you, of course. Okay, all right then. So my next pick then for track category nine, free pick, I'm going to take the afterburner theme from Bayonetta, Two Birds, One Stone.
Bayonetta Soundtrack's got loads I like on it. I really love the different versions of Fly Me to the Moon. Just really sums up the sensibility of Bayonetta so well.
Like Matthew said with Moon River, it's that thing of the platinum translation of a standard like that. Just really elevates it, subverts it, blows it out. It's such a magic trick they have on the different music that they cover in those games.
But what I like about the original Bayonetta is it does have these references to other Sega or Capcom games. And with Bayonetta 1 specifically, they actually use obviously music from, they can use music from Sega games. And the afterburner theme is great.
I really think it's a fantastic bit of arcade music. And I wouldn't quite pick it for bleep-bloop because Chrono Trigger means more to me. But I do acknowledge it's a fantastic bit of retro music.
And this version of Bayonetta, where Bayonetta is like riding a motorcycle along this big freeway, which is one of the actually less creatively successful parts of the game. As we learned with Bayonetta 3, anytime you're kind of not on foot doing Bayonetta stuff, Bayonetta is always in slightly dicey territory, I think. It's sort of like, it's best when it's left in its hack and slash comfort zone, I think.
But nonetheless, it's a very exciting set piece because it just has this very dramatic sort of like, Bayonetta version of the afterburner theme playing. It's really, really good. I sometimes listen to it to get me pumped up in the gym.
So there it goes, Matthew. And shout out also to the space harrier theme that makes it into Bayonetta as well. That's also quite good, but the afterburner theme is better.
What's your next pick?
For boss theme that rips, I am taking Kirby and the Forgotten Land and the King Dedede boss fight music.
When I first played this game, this tune didn't necessarily register with me in a big way. Then I saw a Twitter meme of loads of footage of different people headbanging to the King Day Day Day theme, and I went back and listened to it, and it just became lodged in my head as something truly preposterous, but brilliantly representative of what Kirby and the Forgotten Lands about. I mean, that is as kid-friendly a game as they come, but as we discussed at the time, it goes to some excessive places where it's almost, it's like, what happens if you wanted to give a kid a taste of how mad a Platinum game can become, for example?
And this theme tune has big attitude to that. King Day Day Day, not a character I care about or I'm interested in at all, never gave his theme tune a second thought before hearing this version, but I think it is just hilariously over the top, and just, yeah, really, really good fun.
Yeah, I can't say I remember this piece of music, but I do remember thinking the music was great in this, generally. You can always depend on Kirby for that. Even if the games are slightly mead, the music's always great.
So, yeah, I look forward to listening to this in the episode when it goes live also, Matthew. Okay, great. Okay, for album category nine, Cult Favorite, Matthew, will you allow me to have Nier Automata?
Cult Favorite's the one I'm still struggling with the most.
Yeah, I think it's sort of like, even though it's quite a big cult, you know, like a, I think it sold like nine million copies or something, it's like a Scientology size cult, basically. It's like, I think it fits the profile of this category. You know, it's not a Final Fantasy.
The music is a bit more unusual. I think it does, I think it does fit.
I'll accept, but you have to forward me some generosity with my cult pit.
Yeah, okay, Vice City it is for Matthew then, I look forward to it. Yeah, okay, that's fine. Generosity is back on the table.
So yeah, Nier Automata's soundscape is so unusual and specific. It's like, sometimes it's just a bit deranged when if you go to the amusement park area, for example, it's sort of like off putting an alien and sometimes extremely sad. And in some ways it took playing Stella Blade for last week's episode to realize how much that music had stuck with me after seven years, you know, just how deep it runs because the Stella Blade music is riffing on it, on it so much.
So the composers here are Keiichi Okabe, Keigo Hohashi and Kuniyuki Takahashi, if I'm mispronouncing those names, which I almost certainly am, please forgive me. But again, like this is the funny old thing about Nier Automata is you can see where they've cut corners because the budget's not that big. And that's in like the open world, which looks like it's made of like polystyrene buildings for the most part, or just like flat, not particularly distinctive lands.
You end up going to the same places over and over again as you play through the different endings of this game. But the music just does so much to underline it's kind of like sad, post-apocalyptic atmosphere, this hopeless kind of like vibe to it. But there are all these different flavors that do come into it as the game changes tone.
Really, yeah, like I said, it's really stuck with me. And I think there's nothing else like it in games. It's just a very precise thing that they were going for tonally with this game.
And the music's absolutely a key part of achieving that.
Yeah, it is great. I was listening to tracks for this to see if I could pick out a particular theme or a boss theme that would work in my tracks elsewhere. And I completely get what you mean about Stellar Blade reminding you of it.
But I also think listening to this soundtrack, it's, I think it is much better than Stellar Blade. Like Stellar Blade is kind of a reminder of, oh, this kind of thing is excellent, but it is done much better by, you know, Nier. Feels mimicked in Stellar Blade and feels like authentic here somehow.
Yeah, because it's just the first time that you've heard anything like it. I think there's a lot of like, yeah, like I say, slow women wailing kind of like tracks in this.
There's so much like intent in Nier Automata and it's so funny, they've got Papi Amache, Moonhead Man going like, it's all bullshit, I'm an idiot, don't listen to anything I say. When actually there's very few games with this level of control and authorial vision. One of the most delightful, delightful kind of projects and creator experiences.
Yeah, absolutely. It's, yeah, it's singular, as they say. And yeah, Stellar Blade sits in its shadow despite their best efforts.
So yeah, okay, great stuff, Matthew. Thank you for engaging me on that one. What's the next pick?
Well, let's get out of the way and see if I can, see if I can get this through as a cult pick, as a cult favorite. I'm making this case on the grounds that this is not a beloved entry, sold far fewer copies than Nier Automata. I would like to make a case for Professor Layton versus Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.
I think that is a cult favorite because-
It's a cult favorite of mine. I'm the one man cult.
I mean, copies of this are very rare now. I don't think it's sold very well. The issue of O&M that had this in the cover definitely didn't sell very well.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Like it's, the collision of these two characters, in some ways I think that Phoenix Wright's popularity is kind of crested now. Now is Apex Mountain for Phoenix Wright. Whereas I think Apex Mountain for Professor Layton was in the DS days, probably the third DS one.
Yeah, they just managed to sit like in the valley between their two apexes.
Yeah, exactly. And I think that's, it's a good pick. It's an unusual game.
People still don't really talk about this game that much. So yeah, it's all yours pal.
Yeah, okay, that's great. I mean, for me, it's a bit of a cheeky kind of two for one because it has authentic Professor Layton music, authentic Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney music. So it kind of covers all the standards of both worlds, which are hugely satisfying.
But then it also has interesting hybrid stuff where the Professor Layton instruments are kind of worked into some of the Ace Attorney tracks. So you get like some sort of fiddles and accordions and things coming through. It's probably the most successful bit of this game that does bring those two worlds together, is that the soundtrack is a place where they're kind of sort of synthesized into something new where in the main game, they maybe never quite click and they never quite find the kind of mechanical middle ground between the two.
The soundtrack definitely delivers the end credits role for this, which is just like opens with a big, the main sort of Phoenix Wright theme, but played on with like a big orchestra. Also at the time, like the first time we'd really heard the Ace Attorney tracks given an orchestral cover in games, which, you know, having heard the soundtrack and loved that soundtrack, as I talked about earlier, was just a real thrill for me. So it may not be for everyone, but I think this is a spectacular soundtrack.
Yeah, this is a really good choice. Capturing two of your great loves in one place. It's, yeah, a good choice.
All I need now is Professor Layton versus Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney versus Catherine. That's everything I love all together in one. That's what I really need.
It would be a weird ass game. I don't know what Catherine's portion of the game involves, but I would like to see someone try and make that.
Yeah, versus Schwartz Bros. You know, just, get some cheeseburgers in there, too. Catherine's portion of the game is dispatching your cats a little torch headlights to kill all the rats under your house, Matthew.
That's Catherine's game. Yeah, I look forward to playing it. Yes, good stuff.
I'm coming to 4DS in the near future.
It's like a rat version of Choo Choo Rocket. She's desperately putting down arrow tiles, trying to get the rats to come out of our air bricks.
Yeah, and then Ratamania pops off and they're everywhere and it's unbelievable.
Fucking Choo Choo Rocket. And they're like, why are the rats there? All the Schwartz Brothers rappers.
It all goes full circle, you see.
Yeah, and it's Phoenix Wright saying that in court with Professor Layton having solved that mystery himself. That's perfect, I love that.
Well, the rats were there because you're a disgusting bastard.
Oh, we've definitely entered hour three of this podcast.
Oh my god.
Okay, we're getting there though. Just five left for me. Probably four left for you, I think.
I assume so. Okay, features, lyrics, category four of the track categories. I'm gonna pick away from Final Fantasy 16.
So, this is basically the music that plays when Phoenix and Ifrit are battering the shit out of each other at the start. It's just this really intense, operatic kind of theme, even though you're kind of in the tutorial portion of the game. Soken, who is the composer of FF16, really fucking goes for it.
There are preposterous lyrics playing in the background. When you watch the video version of this on YouTube, because they still haven't put the soundtrack on Spotify and other services, which is tragic. There's like subtitles for all the lyrics.
They are just like ridiculously dramatic, really fun. But away is just, it's got so much power to it. And I think it really captures the sort of like idea of kingdoms shifting in power, sort of vibes of FF16.
It sets the tone so, so well for the game to come. Do you know this track, Matthew?
When you said lyrics, the kind of the choral element of it kind of pass you by, but otherwise that's a great pick. Choral gets you into a lot of fun stuff.
Yeah, it does, it's just a bit, it's where I think it distinguishes itself from some of the other Final Fantasy soundtracks as well. I don't think I've heard another mainline FF game do this kind of thing, like the way that the chorus, the choral soundtrack element does work here. So yeah, Away is, it's my favorite track from that, that soundtrack, it's the one that's endured many months after playing it.
It really hits the spot. And again, I just love summons battering the shit out of each other in Final Fantasy, that's always good. And this is like music that, this is someone like properly matching the occasion with the music, so I do love it.
What's your next pick, Matthew?
From the sublime to the ridiculous, I will take track six, rhythm action favorite. It will be the original GBA rhythm Tengoku, and the track is The Bon Adoree.
Kansaiin agaru.
Rhythm Tengoku and the Rhythm Heaven series, a little hard to kind of cram into this, because even though the music is killer, and at the heart of everything it is, listening to them in isolation to try and pick one out, I just couldn't get into them without the button presses and the game there, you know, and I found it kind of a hard exercise, so I was worried it wasn't gonna make the cut. But this one is the minigame, I don't think they've ever done it again outside of the GBA one, if it's in one of the later remakes, my bad. But it's four dancing girls dancing to this song called, I assume the song is called The Bonadourie, and it's got lyrics, it's quite rough sounding, because it's a game by advanced game, so it doesn't have like huge capacity for like incredibly clear audio.
But if you can put up with that, it has this really nice rhythm to it, it has this really nice chorus where you are kind of, in the game, you're tapping the buttons to this kind of chant of don don pan pan, don don pan pan, which I have made sound very un-musical there, but you will have heard it in the snippet. It sounds delightful. I almost picked this for Earworm.
This was a huge Earworm. When I first started on NGamer, they'd reviewed Rhythm Tengoku and Import in one of the previous issues, and they were always talking about these songs. I had no frame of reference for.
This Don Don Pan Pan sound effect was mentioned in the mag in loads of places. And I think once you've heard this tune, and particularly once you've played the game, like you'll understand why it just really worms in there. I also just wanted to represent Rhythm Heaven as a series, and I thought this was the most palatable way of doing it.
Yeah, I think this Don Don Pan Pan track has played before on an episode of this podcast. Like maybe one of the drafts or one of the game of the year episodes.
Yeah, I've definitely tried to cram my favorites in here and there.
No, but it's probably not been on the podcast for like three years now, we've been going that long. So yeah, good choice. I did wonder when this particular series I know you enjoy would come up, Matthew.
And here it is. Yeah, it's definitely some pretty unique sounds that come out of your TV when you're playing one of these games. Oh, sorry, I have your handheld when you're playing one of these games or indeed playing in the arcade.
So good choice, I like it.
It will hopefully buy me the vote of Mark Green if he listens to this episode. So again, that's two votes.
Yeah, absolutely, one at a time, they all matter. Okay, album category two, indie game. I'm gonna take FDL Fast Than Light.
Ben Pronti's very kind of like evocative space soundtrack that conveys so much just like the idea of going on an adventure into the unknown and just the exciting Star Trek style battles that occur along the way. The difficult choices you have to make and the high stakes and the fact that the stakes kind of escalate as it goes. It's just such a great soundscape and accompanies like this beautiful pixel art so, so well.
Just to be clear, Matthew, I am a big FDL guy. I'm not just like bowing to the sort of like that one guy on Twitter. No, I did have, I did have this, have this down.
How annoying that someone was like, oh, you better pick this.
Well, along some of the lines, I did quite like the Cobalt Core music from last year. That was pretty good. But FDL is kind of a classic.
I think it has endured and the game has endured as well as a strategy classic on PC and wherever else you play it, tablet or whatever. But yeah, it's sort of like one of those, one of those indie soundtracks that has stayed with me. And whenever I hear the main theme of it, I'm just like, oh, that game, that fucking game that ate so many hours of my life and I never finished.
Great stuff. The Category 2, that's ticked off. What's your next pick, Matthew?
On a long similar lines, and as it was recently mentioned, maybe this is unwise, but for track Category 2 battle theme that rips, I am actually gonna pick Self-Defense from Cobalt Core. Let go.
It's a bit of an unusual battle theme, this one, as it's quite soft. It's got this piano refrain that keeps cropping up. But this was the soundtrack of My Christmas last year, playing this on Steam Deck, and the particular battles where this self-defense team comes up.
I really love it. It's got a real quiet spaciness to it. It doesn't go overblown and epic, but it also feels like in a game where you can get wonked quite quickly and you're kind of struggling to survive, it feels very optimistic, feels like a track that's on your side, which is what I want in a battle theme, willing you on.
It's like, yeah, you can do it. You can outthink this motherfucker. I wish I could remember the composer's name because whoever they are, I think they're a bit of a genius, for the whole soundtrack, but specifically this track.
Oh, I've got your back, pal, because I have my computer open right here where I can check for you. Oh, wait, they didn't write down the soundtrack on the Wikipedia page.
This sucks.
This is the worst thing ever. Cobalt Coat soundtrack.
Thanks for that ship's computer.
Aaron Cheroff, apparently, is the composer. That's good. Oh, also on the indie front, I did think about picking Norco.
That's got some pretty amazing music in it. But FTL, I suppose, is probably, I don't know, more people are likely to know what it is. I don't know.
Norco is a great game. But yeah, Cobalt Core, I did really love this game. It was a proper intense love affair with this game at Christmas.
And then it was like that Bellatro thing of I have to step away from this or it will consume my entire life kind of thing. Yeah, but good to have it represented here. Bellatro.
Okay, three picks left. Album category three, shooter, FPS or otherwise, I am going to take Unreal Tournament. So I did think about original Doom and original Quake for this.
I think they would be a bit too obvious in terms of like, you know, whenever you read an FPS game, soundtracks like List or people pulling stuff out, they talk about Doom because obviously the music is so striking and iconic. And, you know, it's like one of the, it's the key text for the first person shooter genre and likewise Nine Inch Nails doing the soundtrack for Quake, you know, very important to that game. Unreal Tournament, I picked it as more, slightly more of a personal favorite and the music really is incredible.
It's, in particular, the track Forgone Destruction is just so fucking good. There's a loop of this, an hour long loop of this I listen to on YouTube all the time. Got 860,000 views, which would suggest that people are as into this as I am.
But in general, this is much more in line with that drum and bass kind of like type of music that we associate with like PS1 kind of games. It's from that era. I did almost have it in 90s as fuck as well because this is a 1999 game.
Really, really good. And again, just has that vibe of like, it feels like one dude in a sound studio just went, just had loads and loads of cans of Coke and composes. And it's like, yeah, fucking yeah.
That's how I picture this being made.
Yeah, it was cans of Coke.
I want to believe that that's what happened here. Really love it. This game is fucking great.
And I really, I think like people have been hoping that Night Dive will get their hands on it at some point and be able to run servers of it. I think they have like openly pitched to Epic who closed this down, like, please let us do this. And I really hope they go along with it.
The composer is officially listed as Stray Light Productions and Mikhail Van Der Bos. It's so fucking good. I really do recommend, just slap on a playlist of this and you just realize how great this music is.
And again, we don't even really think about the music. It's just, there's just so much effort put into it. And I think there was quietly a really high bar with first-person shooter music going on throughout the 90s.
And this is really, really good, man. It's great stuff. And yeah, I did think about the original Deus Ex for this category as well.
Not quite a shooter. And I thought about Max Payne 3 just to piss Matthew off, but Unreal Tournament is where my heart lies. What's your next choice, Matthew?
Tracks for free pick. This is really tough. I've got 10 tracks that I haven't been able to squeeze in elsewhere and I really love them all.
Like this category, this free pick category list is just like what my Spotify playlist would be.
Right.
I think I will pick Great Ace Attorney Chronicles and the track is called Partners. Thank you.
This is a piece of music that plays skip 20 seconds ahead, if you're really averse to spoilers, towards the end of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, where they finally reveal who Sherlock Holmes or Herlock Sholmes sidekick is, Watson. Throughout the game, you've assumed his Watson is sort of dead and not on the scene. And it finally unites the characters, and it plays this piece of music, which is the sort of Holmes and Watson theme, thus partners.
I was thinking it's tap dancing. There isn't tap shoes in this. There's sort of some kind of clacky instrument, but it's sound, you know, this has this whole kind of dance of deduction kind of motif running through this game.
And to me, it just sounds like two 50 year old detectives having like a mad dance to an accordion. And like, kind of hard to detach from the narrative importance of the track, but it is also just an absolute banger. A track I listen to a lot to get the creative juices flowing.
I think it's responsible for people leaving this pair of games with such a positive impression, because it just ends on such a musical high because of this track. There are lots of other individual Ace Attorney pieces I could pick, but I think this one is pretty special. There's a really funny YouTube video where someone's made a rhythm heaven mini game to this track.
They've like animated or like drawn their own graphics as if this was a rhythm heaven mini game. I'm responsible for at least 20 views of that video.
I actually like turned the sound down when you were spoiling the sort of like, where this music comes from. Because I do at some point would like to play all the Ace Attorney games.
Yeah, I didn't spoil who the characters were, just that something happens, but yes.
It's the only time I've ever recorded a podcast where I've not been listening to something you've been saying. Like it's literally a sound off. You could have been saying, Samuel is a dickhead over and over again.
We'll find out when we get to the, maybe I'll edit that in.
That would be really funny, actually. Please do that. Again, big hour three energy to doing that.
Okay, I like that. I think you've represented Ace Attorney well enough now.
I've only got one left.
I've got two left. So track category one, theme tune that rips. I'm gonna take my beloved Onomusha to Samurai's Destiny.
Yeah, this theme, this main theme is amazing.
People who play the game know what it is. If you haven't played the game, you have no idea. The snippet, yeah, exactly.
The snippet of music before this, so hopefully whet your appetite. This is unusual. This is not actually on Spotify like a lot of the other music is from Capcom's games.
And my hunch is, I think this is the only game in the series where the music is done by the composer Taro Iwashiro, who did compose the soundtrack for Memories of Murder. Quite a prestigious composer. And so I think the reason that that music has not ended up on Spotify is probably some kind of royalty situation.
So it's kind of like you have to go and seek it out on various websites where these things may or may not be stored. KH Insider. And then you can listen to this.
Obviously it's on YouTube as well. Really, really good, really dramatic, really sets the scene. I think Onomishu never has another main theme that's anywhere near as memorable as this.
I think this is just so great at making the game feel as cinematic as it aspires to be. So Iwashiro really brings it there. Yeah, he's like a proper legit composer.
I was looking at some of the films he's done music for. He did the music for, oh no, wait, that's not the, sorry, I thought it was a Ghibli film, but it's not. It's a different Kiki's Delivery Service.
It's fine, we're all good. But did the music for Red Cliff. Remember that film, Matthew?
Oh, I love Red Cliff.
Yeah, so he's, I believe there's a version of like a Japanese version of Unforgiven as well. He did the music.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he did the music for that. So he's, like I say, proper legit. And this is one of the only game works he actually did.
So felt like a good pick. Just one category left for me after this. What's your final pick, Matthew?
My final category is track 10, the game over category, a song that must play at my funeral. And it can only be a lyric-free cover of You've Got a Friend in Me from Kingdom Hearts 3.
Yes, that's so good.
I had to be Randy Newman. Is it gonna be the terrible Mega Drive rendition of You've Got a Friend and Me from Toy Story and the Mega Drive? That would be too perverse.
This is credited to Randy Newman that he wrote this cover for Kingdom Hearts 3.
I mean, that must appall you that he had to do work on Kingdom Hearts.
Well, unfortunately, it means I am now super into Kingdom Hearts, and will be playing the entire series just so I can enjoy the work of Randy Newman. It sounds like a very pleasant, plinky-plonky piano cover. It's on the Randy Newman's official YouTube channel, so he's clearly claiming ownership of it.
I didn't know this track existed until about two hours ago, or three hours ago before this podcast started, and I was like, well, obviously. It probably will be Randy Newman played at my real funeral, not to be too real about this. I just think that's in better taste than like, you know, fucking Earthworm Jim or something.
You always remind me of Earthworm Jim. I sort of say when I'm at your funeral.
I'll be becoming Earthworm Food, you think?
Yeah, yeah, very good. I do worry that between this novelty pick and your We Shop Music novelty pick, that you will win it on that basis alone, because people will just be like, oh my God, well done.
It's very endearing.
It's a very good comic bit, I gotta say. Well done, that's another great choice. Really funny.
Yeah, I'm glad you didn't pick the cursed Mega Drive version, it's not very good.
I mean, again, it just shows how different we are as tastes in that how different our funerals will be. You playing out to the stoic majesty of Mass Effect 3, me playing out to a Kingdom Hearts 3 rendition of You've Got Friend in Me. I think that captures kind of what we're about.
Yeah, I think it kinda does, sure. I mean, I don't take myself that seriously. I was being a bit meta-dramatic on purpose by picking an end once and for all.
I don't think I'm as good as Commander Shepard or anything, just to be clear about that. But yeah, I do really like that pick. And it is actually a nice version.
I have heard it. It's, the Toy Story level is very nicely done in Kingdom Hearts III. They really bring it.
And so it feels very authentic in a way that's quite hard to do when you're mimicking Pixar, I would say. So even the Tom Hanks sound like is good.
Did they get John Ratzenberger in to do the pig? I'd be hats off if you bring back that level of cast member.
Yeah, it's actually Nolan North, the pig in this one, Matthew.
Oh, okay, that's the end of the draft. Oh wait, now I've got to pick one more thing, haven't I? Sorry.
My last category is track category two, Battle Theme That Rips. I've picked Blinded by Light from the Final Fantasy 13 soundtrack.
Soundacks Draft . So Matthew backed me into a corner on this, but I actually, by not picking FF15, it reminded me to go through all of the different Final Fantasy games and remind myself how good are these battle themes and which is the best one from the pile. And I think I had previously said that Blinded by Light was really good on that FF episode that we did last year. And it is great.
I think it's the most searched track for FF13 on Spotify, so it's clearly the thing that's really stuck with people from this game. I think it is probably the best bit of music in the game. Just really exciting, really builds and means you're never mad when a battle kicks off because it just really gets you in the mood for it.
And it's sort of like crests. It's just really, really good. It's fucking hard to describe battle music, man.
But just believe me when I say Blinded by Light is an absolute banger. There it is, Matthew. 20 entry draft, three hour pod.
I thought this would be two hours and we'd fire through it, but we never fucking do, do we?
This is how long they tend to be when we've just got 20 picks between us. This is 40 picks.
Yeah, yeah, it's true, it's true. It's, you know, it's the one beefy podcast of the month, isn't it? So it's, it's all good.
You've got to do it right. I think this is something we're both passionate about and hopefully, you know, in our picks, that passion came through. I definitely ran out of steam about halfway through.
So apologies if the actual sections of the tracks gets a bit vague and some pretty shameful analysis from me. Yeah, yeah, it's great. That's me thinking about pasta.
Yeah, and you'll have that pasta in four minutes, Matthew. All we got to do is go through these picks once and then people will have them. And yes, I'll also give the picks.
So Matthew, after this, share your document with me and I'll give the picks to Graham, who updates the website so people can go to the fan site and see the picks there if they want to recite them. But we'll go through them once here. We'll go through them slowly as well.
So you can kind of pass it and listen back if you want to. All that good stuff. So starting with the album categories.

I've got the soundtrack to Persona 5.

Category 10, the Game Over category, This Must Play at Your Funeral, an End Once and For All by Clint Mansell from the Mass Effect 3 soundtrack is my pick.
I have, You've Got a Friend in Me, as made popular by Kingdom Hearts 3.
Really good. Okay, that's done. Like I say, go on to the Discord and the Announcements channel and you'll see the poll there.
And we'll talk about it on a future episode. I'll also update the episode description to say who won. And it was fun, Matthew.
I think that's a really all encompassing run at this idea for an episode. And may we never talk about it again. And yes, I hope the listeners enjoy it.
So if you appreciate the undertaking that goes into this kind of nonsense, three hours on a Monday, Matthew wanting pasta, etc. patreon.com/backpagepod, you can get an additional two extra episodes a month. This month we did an episode on the Dreamcast, played a bunch of games on that.
And we're doing an episode on the Mad Max movies and the XXL episodes, which are all about pop culture. That's coming later. So, yep, if you want to support us, go there.
Maybe if we hit three grand one day, we'll do something special. Who knows? But the podcast could be followed at Backpage Pod.
Matthew, where can people find you?
I am MrBazzle UnderscorePesto on Twitter and MrBazzlePestoNoUnderscore on BlueSky. I did a BlueSky tweet the other day, or not tweet, or whatever they call it. I interacted with you on it.
You did a blue, you know, it was a good blue, that one. I enjoyed it. Yes.
Okay, good. And I can't remember if I said where I am. I'm Samuel W.
Roberts on all platforms. Thank you so much for listening and we'll be back next week. Goodbye.
