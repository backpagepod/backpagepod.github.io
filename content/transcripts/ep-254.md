Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, one of Barth's most famous curry joints, the Bengal Brasserie, has closed. I believe this is a place of great NGamer significance. How are you feeling after hearing the news?
Devastated. It was like a little cave under the ground that served decent curry. Not anything staggeringly amazing, but decent.
Like a six or a seven out of 10, I would say.
I mean, if I was going out for a curry, it's where I'd go to. And I used to go there with NGamer for our Christmas meals. I've had several nice curries there with Edge Magazine back in the day, sitting there nervously, trying not to annoy Tony Mott while eating some chicken tikka.
So many fond memories. I'm sad it's closed. Apparently it closed on the 17th, and I had a lamb boner from there takeaway on the 16th.
So I feel like I was there for it in the end.
Yeah, that's good. I think it closed during COVID for a while as well, because I remember when COVID was over, it had a really faded Eat Out To Help Out sign, like tapes to the inside of the glass when you go into the tunnel. And that was like a Last Of Us Part 2 style post-apocalyptic detail, because Eat Out To Help Out just feels like a bad science fiction short story at this point.
I just like that people who don't know what this restaurant is, which is most people listening to this podcast, they've heard Cave and now they've heard Tunnel, and they're like, what the fuck is this restaurant?
Well, it's like a doorway that just, it sort of looks like it could have been like an estate agent's once. Like there's loads of like glass you walk past in order to get in. And I've said this about multiple bath restaurants now, them having a state agent energy, but there's a little bit of that.
And then, yeah, when you go inside, the ambience is very nice when you go underground. For an underground restaurant, I would say they really punch above their weight or they did. But I'm sad to lose it too.
It was a PC Gamer haunt for a while as well. And yes, such as it is. But yeah, a nice note to start us on Matthew, we are back with another draft here.
And after 22 minutes of technical issues in the background here, wrestling with microphones and such, delighted to once again be joined by Ashley Day and Dave Scarborough. Gentlemen, how are you doing? Ash, I'll start with you.
You good?
Hello. Well, I am the cause of the microphone woes. But I've got over that.
It's not me for once.
I don't know if you guys have. Yeah, not Dave for once. But yeah, I'm pretty good.
Thank you.
Yeah. Glad to hear it. And Dave, how are you doing?
You all right?
I'm doing great. Just back from a couple of weeks in Florida, visiting Nintendo World and various other fantastic sites and sounds of the theme park industry out there. So I'm wearing my Luigi jumper right now, which you can't see because we don't put our cameras on, but very much representing Team Green on this side of the mic.
What was the highlight of Nintendo World for you, Dave?
That's a good question. Probably the DK float, which comes in this DK-shaped barrel mug, and it is a big scoop of pineapple doll whip on top of a fizzy diluted lilt drink, and it has a waffle cone wedged in it as well. It was very delicious.
There was some rides as well, and other things, but that was a highlight.
So your highlight was the drink.
Yeah, the drink is better than the rides.
It was very refreshing in the Florida sun. No, I mean, it was great. I got one of those over-expensive wristbands.
We bobbed some question mark boxes. We did some sort of interactive games, did the Mario Kart thing, ate at Toastall Cafe. It's actually pretty fantastic, the whole theme in and immersion of the area.
So I genuinely was very, very, very impressed and spent a lot of time there.
Yeah, that's fun. I got little notes from you as you were going, and you telling me about the bits of merch you bought. I saw you at the Lightsaber Shop in Disneyland as well.
You look like you're having a nice time.
I always imagine myself, Sam and I many years ago went to one of the secret cinema experiences and it was for The Empire Strikes Back. And Sam's, our journey through that evening was Sam constantly narrating the value of fun he was having at every single moment. So I can't remember how much we paid for the tickets, probably like a hundred quid.
And it would just be like, well, I've had about 20 pounds worth of fun right now. And it would creep up in gradual increments, but it never reached the sort of face value of the night at any point.
How immersive for you. Yeah.
Yeah.
You had your like, what was it, Uncle Owen burger or whatever it was.
I think it was a Lando burger actually. And yeah, which is exactly what Lando Calrissian would have wanted, I think, was Lando burgers. It was a very, it's a very me anecdote, but yes, we paid for a Star Wars immersive experience.
I was not especially immersed. I just went there and complained all evening and ruined Dave's evening and Ian Dransfield's evening. But that's not the first or last time that would happen for Dave.
So, you know, such as it is a nice memory. But I appreciate you bringing that up. I hadn't thought about that for a long time.
Well, you know, it's like, did I have several thousand pounds worth of value in the experience in Orlando, Florida? I'm just going to say yes, and that will comfort me for my bank balance moving forward.
That's fair enough. Ash, I feel like I should ask you something of substance as well, because we had a little conversation with Dave there. What's been good?
Are you playing anything good lately?
What's been going on?
He doesn't deserve it because his mic broke for 25 minutes.
He deserves it. I like Ash, and I've never heard Ash with such crisp audio in this podcast either, so that's exciting. What have you been playing lately, Ash?
What have I been playing lately? I've just finished, I don't know why I'm laughing, I've just finished Simon the Sorcerer Origins. I guess I'm laughing because that is such a me thing to say.
That's like a game Dave would make fun of you for playing basically, like a joke game, you know?
Well, jokes on Dave because it is a solid 7 out of 10 experience.
Great jokes on you, 7 out of 10.
I really lost out at that.
Well, excellent.
Yeah, Chris Barry is back after 32 years, so he's a 60-something year old man and it's a prequel. So he's playing like an 11-year-old boy and somehow that works. So yeah, kudos to him.
Yeah, no comment on Chris Barry, so yeah.
I saw you're doing a talk on worms. What's that about?
Oh yeah, that's this Saturday as we're recording.
To clarify, that's the video game, right? You've got some problems that you're a medical panel for.
Well, it's the video game. Whether I've got other problems or not remains to be seen. Yeah, I'm doing a talk at Wakefield Museum about the 30th anniversary of worms and the history of Team 17.
As you would expect from Wakefield Museum, they want a lot of Wakefield content in their talk. So there are sections where I have photographs of a building that's now a charity shop in Wakefield. This was Team 17 headquarters in 1994, that kind of thing.
Or this guy who used to present adverts for a local shop called Mike's Carpets, he was immortalized in Worms Armageddon with the weapon, Mike's Carpet Bombs. All this stuff, local people are going to lap up.
I can't even spoil all that gold, you know?
I mean, but we fucking do that every week for Bath on this podcast. That's true. We never get outreach from the council to come and do a talk, but we're offering that service on the go.
The talk will have been and gone by the time this episode is out, but the talk opens a Team 17 and Worms exhibition that's going to be installed in Wakefield Museum for at least a year. They've borrowed a load of stuff from us for two years, so we'll see. So if anyone happens to be in Wakefield and they're a video games fan, like it actually will be worth popping in.
You'll see some rare items that we've donated, learned some stuff about worms. So like a kind of non-cynical, non-ironic plug, like that is something people should do if they're in Wakefield.
It's very nice. Well, you know, good. I appreciate you sharing something genuinely enriching.
Well, Dave just talked about his holiday. It's perfect.
You can grab the NFTs in the gift shop on your way out.
I'm joking.
I'll take it back.
Let's move on. Let's move on. Okay.
So this episode is the 16-bit Mega Draft. A few learnings from the past few episodes. I will say actually that Matthew has won every single one of these four-person drafts we've done.
Why are you saying that?
PS2 Redraft, 360 Redraft, All-Star Japanese Game Developer Redraft. Matthew has won every single one. He is the dominant force of these drafts.
So let's just remember that going into this.
Don't try and spike this before it's even started.
It's like the Golden Globes. Like Ash, Sam and I are like the succession cast. We're like Matthew McFadden, Rory Colkin, Brian Cox.
And so we split the vote with our incredible lists. And then you're like Billy Crudup in The Morning Show and just walk away with the rest, with the win.
You get what I'm saying?
He's a fine actor. I've not got a problem with that.
Matthew's like, oh, don't spike the draft by just sharing the truth. Go along with my pity narratives where I'm the only dog in every single draft.
You're framing it just by putting the facts out there. You're already putting spin on it.
It's not spin. You've won three drafts. How is that spin?
You're like, oh, oh, Castle's under attack again. Vote Castle, vote Castle. That's your strategy every single time.
I just can't believe that I'm already under attack.
Well, look, I mean, don't get too defensive about it. But anyway, yes, you have won all three of these. And we're back doing this again.
Some slight tweaks from before. We are keeping the kill and steal rules from last time because I feel like they're made for great podcast drama. But we acknowledge that maybe the discussion of the game has got a little bit tired in the last half an hour of the last one.
So we shortened it a little bit. We've gone from 11 picks each to nine. So it just takes a little bit of work out of the thing, which is good.
We've got a preamble here, but it's not particularly long. I'm going to begin that preamble now, as ever, commentating on the podcast as it's going. Matthew, we did a 16-bit episode on Patreon a couple of years back, which I remember enjoying.
Remind us of your relationship to 16-bit games.
I had a Mega Drive growing up and the boys across the river, crossed them off on your Back Page Bingo card. They had a SNES, so I felt like I was quite catered for on the Nintendo and Sega front. We also had an Amiga, Amiga 500.
Yeah, I was playing a lot of stuff back then. My memories are of games which we owned, you know, I wasn't buying games, you know, I was only ten or something, so I didn't really have much money, or any money as a child. It's that weird thing where you just grow up playing the ten games you happen to have, so I wonder if some of those oddities will appear in my draft picks.
Yeah, I think that's going to be true for all of us, though, like how much your, you know, very subjective experience of this hardware that certainly for us that we owned when we were younger and didn't have much control over our libraries, how much that infects the experience and how much of that truth you reflect in the picks. I think we'll all have some version of that going into this. You know, I completely understand why you feel that way.
Dave and Ash, I put take us through your personal histories in the plan here, but I meant specifically about 16-bit gaming and not your lives or anything.
Well, just like Matthew was saying, I didn't have much control at that age. I mean, I was six years old, I think, when we got the Mega Drive. I remember my dad one day saying, we're going to go to Toys R Us and buy a new game for your Mega Drive.
I only had Sonic the Hedgehog at that point, so it was like, this is going to be the second game I own. This was such a spontaneous act of kindness. And generosity from my dad.
It was just so uncharacteristic for him. We go to Toys R Us, we go in, I remember we get to the video game section, and he doesn't give me a choice. He just picks up PGA Tour Golf.
I'm just like, I don't want this. I'm six years old. I don't play golf.
I have zero interest in it. I don't even watch it on TV. And it was just like tough shit.
I remember him just dropping 50 quid on this game. It's actually a great game. Might make the list, might not.
But yeah, my sort of perspective of the sort of Mega Drive games library was very much dictated by what my dad decided he would like to play as well as me, or in some cases, just what he would like to play.
Did he like bad Ghostbusters games too?
Yeah, absolutely. He did. He bought my first...
Well, he liked the good ones as well. He bought me the Master System add-on for the Mega Drive and got me Ghostbusters for that, which is where the love started.
That is nice. I can't believe that episode happened this year. That's a bit of a fever dream that that happened this year.
I can't believe that happened. It's like the Star Wars Holiday Special of Back Page episodes, that one. It's crazy that it happened, really.
Okay, cool. So it sounds like you two both have a similar relationship with these games.
Yeah. And I knew I had a family friend who had a SNES and same thing. They just seemed to own...
I'm sure everyone had a friend who just... They didn't, but it felt like they owned just every cool game that you didn't. And you were just endlessly jealous of what they were playing on a daily basis.
So you only experienced some of those big iconic games was just sitting around someone's house for three hours after school and just either watching them play or being allowed to just get hands on with it. So yeah, that's a lot of where my SNES knowledge comes from.
I would say actually my SNES knowledge is kind of similar. And I would say as well, there are some games on SNES where I have a much stronger relationship with them because of the virtual console on Wii or Wii U. Or even like the GBA re-releases than I have with the actual games and the hardware.
God, have I ever even played like a normal SNES, like a original SNES? I don't think I have, you know? Like I had friends who had them, but they can't have been close friends.
My friend over the road had a NES and an Atari 2600, but not, yeah, not a SNES. So yeah, my entire relationship with it really is after the fact. So we're very much in the same boat, had a Mega Drive, had a smattering of secondhand games, but I'm curious to hear Ash's perspective on this, because Ash, I think you are, this is not me outing you, but the oldest of us.
And therefore, I kind of see this draft as being your home turf, really. Like, I think I imagine you having a huge affinity with a lot of these games. What's your relationship with the 16-bit era?
Yeah, well, I am a bit older, so I turned 10 in 1992. So I think I was kind of the prime age for enjoying 16-bit stuff back then. And yeah, like you're saying, I think everything that we're going to discuss today, bar the Neo Geo, I'd like played at a friend's house before I got my own.
But I did eventually, I think, Christmas 93, I got a Mega Drive with Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition, the one you had to play with three buttons, and you would switch between punch and kick by hitting the start button. If anyone can believe that, that's an insane way to play Street Fighter. But I did, and I never got a six button pad.
Then probably about three years after that, around 96, very late, is when I got my Amiga, which we will also be talking about. Then I once played a Super Nintendo in a hotel lobby, so fully rounded experience of the 16-bit era.
Okay. Well, excellent stuff. I think we will have a different perspective on this, which is exciting, because I do want to know how you all think this draft is going to go down, and what the battlegrounds are going to be, which of the key genres that you think are going to go first, and what your angles of attack are maybe going to be, a little hint here or there.
Matthew, how about you?
This is probably the loosest plan I've ever had for one of these. You know, I have decent knowledge, I think I have a big enough pool that I can kind of dip into, but outside of a few danger categories where I need to get something just because I just don't have any interesting takes on other games within it. I feel like I'm going to kind of vibe my way through.
I didn't pick any amazing games up front because you fuckers will take them all again.
Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off.
Though I did think I could do that and force your hands and try and get the pity again, but I kind of want to thrash you guys in a bit more kind of a purer, honest way this time.
Excellent. That's good. That's what I wanted to hear, Matthew.
I just wanted you to be a bit more of a swinging dick in these drafts than you normally pretend you're not. So that's good. Dave, how about you?
How do you think this is going to go down?
Similar to Matthew, I had a quite loose plan for this. I came in too aggressive last time, full of lulz, and I think that backfired at the back end of the draft.
And then you exploded in orbit at the end, really, didn't you? That's what happened.
I burnt bright, but not for long.
It's very much an Icarus situation for you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I burnt bright, but not for long. But we're still talking about it.
I was a one or two games a year kind of kid, so weirdly the games I typically gravitated towards were licensed games, as they felt more like a sure thing to my young brain. Like, oh, I recognize those characters or I love that TV show or movie, and so I'm going to get the game. And luckily, during this period, a lot of those licensed games were good, and in some cases, you know, better than a lot of the major first party or, you know, big publisher titles that were coming out in the system then.
But I am conscious of not being just the licensed video game guy, not just picking Ghostbusters because it fucking rocks. So I am trying to diversify a bit. And then there's always the steal and the kill.
And to be honest, I am fully expecting Ash to run away with this draft. This really feels like it's his home turf.
I am not so sure about that because a lot of these drafts, you know, the winner is often the one who picks the most kind of stone cold, recognizable classics.
Agreed.
And I am just never that guy. Like I am the guy who talks about some random crap that he played and has elevated in his mind, unfortunately. So I am cursed.
You got to bring your game, Ash. Come on.
Yeah. I want the two of you to like properly gun for this, this time. Come on, to play to win.
Well, to play to win a little bit. Sell out like we do.
Sell out and taste victory.
Are we saying that Ghostbusters, the video game is not a draft winning game? Is that what we are trying to say here?
I would say I didn't play a single Ghostbusters game that could be considered like a draft winning game, Dave. At most, I would say the Nes one would be a, the Nes Ghostbusters 2 would be a good wild card. Everything else goes spinning into the bin.
That's my take on that.
Well, my wild card was lost via Domus, I think you'll find.
Well, that's what I mean. You always burn brightly and then sort of explode at the end, and then it all kind of goes wrong. Ash, I think is always a little bit underrated because I agree that you put a lot of thought into your picks, Ash.
But it might be that some of the listeners don't know what they are. And so don't vote for them. And besides, I retaught themselves into Matthew's victim narrative anyway and vote for him, so, you know.
On previous drafts, I have noticed that I do quite well in the early votes, indicating that the people, the hardcore listeners who have taken the time to listen through the podcast and hear my argument around the games can come away convinced. But then once the list is shared online and you get like a wave of people who are they even listening? Are they even paying attention?
I've got no time for these people. They're just checking off a list of things that they recognize. So I think we should cut off the vote after about...
Don't slag off the intelligent listeners.
Matthew's like, leave my constituents alone.
It's the intelligent listeners, it's the brilliant listeners that decide who wins this.
Look, if they don't want to put the time in and play all of the nine games I recommend before voting, then I'm not interested.
Enjoy fourth place, dude.
I think this is going to be, personally, I think this is going to be one of our best drafts. The simple reason that I don't think the pool of great picks is absolutely enormous. Whereas with the All-Star Japanese Game Developer Draft, I think that that was a pretty deep pool of stuff because we went publisher by publisher or developer by developer.
Here, it's like there are some genres where you just need to get something. With the Kill and Steal Rules Incorporated, it could get pretty hairy in some of these. So that might test our knowledge of this era to the limit.
Not Ash, but certainly me, Matthew, Dave. So yeah, definitely two categories here I think are going to be real battlegrounds. So let's take a quick break and we'll come back with the four-person 16-bit Mega Draft.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, time for the four-person Mega Draft, the thing I just said before the break, just then. Looking, great podcasting, looking forward to it.
Let's talk about the categories a bit. So, we got nine of them here. We're originally gonna have eight, but then Ash suggested, well, I kind of suggested an original, another one in response to something that Ash said about the Amiga not technically being 16-bit.
So, this is kind of what we came up with basically. So, category one, platformer. Category two, RPG.
Category three, sports or racing. Category four, fighting game. Category five, side scrolling beat-em-up or shooter.
Category six, wild card. Category seven, free pick, so any game. Category eight, licensed game.
Category nine, Ash's cursed Amiga category. So, Ash thought we could represent the Amiga in that fashion. As mentioned, kill or steal returned from last time as well.
So, that has to be factored into the picking to some extent. So, I always love a good licensed category in these drafts, but I actually, I don't know if you, you chaps thought this, but I felt like we actually could have used the general multiplayer category after doing the research for this, because multiplayer becomes like a, it's just a huge part of the DNA of these consoles and how people enjoyed these consoles, and that was something I wondered after doing the planning for this.
I mean, so many of the licensed games, like appeal to various category. I'm sure licensed games are going to break out from just their category alone, so multiplayer might have been a better fit there.
The Lion King isn't an RPG, Dave.
Well, I was role-playing the whole time.
And Super Metroid is not a shooter, actually. Let's just get that out of the way in case someone tries to go with that. And actually, there's a few other things to consider here.
We should have a no compilations rule as well. Oh, damn it. Oh, no.
I have Mario All-Stars on my list.
I just don't think Mario All-Stars should be eligible because it's three games in one. And it bastardizes the art style of those games, doesn't it, really? So I don't know.
People might not agree with that. What do you think, Matthew? Do you think no compilations is the right thing to do?
Otherwise, you start getting, like, I don't know, all kinds of, like, a bunch of four games. And exactly. Yeah.
So I think that I think in the past that kind of rule served us well, Matthew. What do you think?
I think there are some games which are borderline, though, in that they have the shape of a compilation, but they're actually all new games, which I think is allowed.
I don't really know what you're alluding to there, but fair enough.
Well, that's good.
Well, I guess soon we'll find out, won't we? Ash, you kind of agreed to the categories, and I think you were happy with the Amiga category. Do you want to talk about the overall shape of what we got here?
Yeah. Well, by the way, the Amiga is a 16-bit machine, but what you were referring to there is that at one point, we were talking about having the PC Engine in.
Right, yes.
We landed on agreeing that PC Engine is an 8-bit system, which I think is fair. I'm pretty happy with the categories. I think it covers most of the bases.
I'm looking at my list now, and would you believe it, sports or racing is where I have the most games picked, which is really strange as I do not like sport in the real world, but there you go. I actually think licensed game is a really interesting category for this era, because I think this is arguably the era where licensed games became more prevalent than they have ever really been, and there's some real nostalgic picks there, and some picks that you might not expect to be good, but in fact are.
I don't think people even regarded them as licensed games at the time. They were just games.
No, maybe not.
They sat shoulder to shoulder with everything else.
And then I'd say the Amiga category, I don't know if I want to give too much of my strategy away here, but I'm focused on titles that were not available on the other platforms, and I think if we were all to do that, it actually becomes one of the most kind of heated categories with like a land grab for a couple of really obvious titles, so I'm nervous.
I think it becomes too niche though if we do that, because I don't have an Amiga, and I think I would just be picking one of those handfuls. I did actually look at a subreddit where they discussed which Amiga games were not ported anywhere else, and it's a pretty lean list compared to the very broad sweep of games that were actually on the platform.
Were they including PC in anything else?
I think they were actually, and it was like the tiniest handful, like four to five games.
If you include games that are on Amiga and PC, but not console, there's some really great games.
Yeah. That's where I've landed on mine, for sure.
Yeah, I have to actually. So yes, that makes sense.
Alongside just stealing Ashley's pick, because assuming he knows what to do on this, because I never touched an Amiga.
Well, it also comes down to what do other people take, and what would I be forced to take for that category. So we'll see how that goes. So yeah, it's an interesting spread.
I did want to ask a question about something Matthew brought up before we started recording. Ash, Matthew reckons, he asked me, I don't have to pick a Neo Geo game, do I? And I said, no, you don't, because we have a four games per platform maximum rule here.
Those platforms are Neo Geo, Mega Drive and SNES. But I was wondering if you could explain with the Neo Geo, what is Matthew missing out on by not including that in the sweep of picks here?
Something that we should speak about that's related to Neo Geo is the the arcade itself. Like long before I had a 16-bit system at home, I was playing 16-bit games in the arcade for years and years. And that's where the best games of that era were, maybe around late 80s, early 90s, Street Fighter 2, for example, starts in an arcade game.
And that's where the Neo Geo was special, because the Neo Geo was literally an arcade at home. They weren't ports or conversions. They were exactly the same games on a big chunky cartridge.
So there's some fantastic picks there, particularly in fighting games and shoot-em-ups. Where I think Neo Geo perhaps feels a little bit unfair in this category is that its lifespan went on much longer than the other systems. They were making new Neo Geo games and very viable ones up until about 2003, 2004.
That's crazy.
It really is. And I think that's testament to the kind of hardcore community that had around it and the fact that the arcades remained somewhat viable through that era, particularly in Japan. So some of the later Neo Geo games just never would have been possible on a Super Nintendo or Mega Drive.
So kind of feels like cheating. But at the same time, how many times are we going to get, how many opportunities are we going to get to recommend some cool Neo Geo games?
Yeah. And there's an amazing archive of them on Nintendo Switch these days as well, like really, really good. And I would say in the discovery of this, that was kind of the revelation when thinking about 16-bit was just realizing how fucking amazing these games looked on this hardware that cost loads of money when it came out.
It was out of reach for most people. I saw someone describe it as the Rolls-Royce of 16-bit hardware, which I think is a good way of putting it. But just unbelievably beautiful-looking and sounding games.
So they do mix this draft up in some interesting ways, I think. But I also think it's like the danger area where there's a high chance that the listeners don't know what the games are. And so no matter how excited you make it sound, it might not be as recognizable to them as like, you know, Super Mario World or whatever.
So I think that's the balancing act to do there.
The drafter's dilemma.
I think it is just very niche, like you're saying. So that is a consideration when making the picks.
Yeah, I also think there's only really three categories where you'd want to pick a Neo Geo game. And I think they're fairly self-evident. Ash mentioned two of them there.
I think sports and racing is the other category where they really thrive. We'll see how that goes down. All right then, so let's get to the rules then.
So it's a snake draft as before. So we go 1, 2, 3, 4 in terms of order of people picking. And then 4, 3, 2, 1.
So there's like a double pick on the turn basically. And we keep doing that till they're all gone. All the games are gone.
We've picked everything here. The kill or steal tokens return. Let's explain those again.
So everyone gets one of each token to use. Steal at the start of your turn. You can take another game from someone else's draft picks.
That counts as your turn however. A game can only be stolen once. So once it's taken, it really does belong to you.
So it's a very powerful thing to use in a draft like this. Kill at the start of your turn. Remove one pick from any draft list entirely.
The game cannot be selected again by anyone. The affected party must then re-pick for that category. This does not count as your turn but you do have to use it at the start of your turn.
Can you kill a game that someone has stolen?
No, that's what I mean. Actually, we might have done a brief FAQ on this last time we did the draft. I forgot.
That was one of the things we came across. We thought it becomes too much like canceling each other out, move at that point. Yeah.
Because obviously you're just going to use it for petty revenge. You can still do that. No.
Well, I think it also adds value to the picks that really move the needle. It's a good bit of draft shithouse-ery, which is obviously always the goal of doing these things. The kills and steals will be mentioned in the draft results.
When I do the little screen grab of all the results, I'll mention who killed what and who stole what. And yes, that will be fun. I think we should probably get to the coin toss.
Maybe I'll do the category reading one more time just to give people context. Platformers, category one, category two RPG, category three sports or racing, category four fighting game, category five side-scrolling beat-em-up or shooter, category six wild card, category seven free pick, category eight licensed game, category nine Ashes Cursed Amiga category. So Matthew, coin toss time.
Let's spin the wheel of names.
Oh yeah, the wheel.
See where it stops. So going first, it's Dave.
Oh, I thought it would be me. I didn't want it to be me.
Jurassic Park on Mega Drive coming straight off the board.
Going second, Ashley Day.
Great, it's still straight from Dave.
Going third, this is the all important third and fourth position. Just, it's me, Samuel going fourth.
OK, I'm on the turn with the double picks then. And yeah, after I do my picks, it's like fucking nine years till I pick again. Good stuff.
All right, in which case, Dave, kick us off.
I think I'm going to go straight off the bat, RPG. I think I'm going to go A Link to the Past on the SNES.
RPG? That's not even an RPG!
This is what I mentioned to Ashley. Does that count as an RPG?
I mean...
Because where does it fit otherwise? Like, it's not a platformer. It would just be free pick.
I think this only goes in free pick, personally. I don't consider the Zelda games really to be RPGs. I'd maybe hear the case for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, but well, those are open world games, really.
Matthew, where do you stand on this?
If it was going to live anywhere else, it would be RPG. I personally don't have an issue with it.
I see it as RPG.
In which case, Dave, three to one, you get to take it. Talk on it.
I mean, I actually came to this after playing Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask. I didn't play it until it was on virtual console, basically. And what's interesting if you go to it after playing, you know, everything to sort of come after up until, I'd say, Breath of the Wild is just how many of the ideas and how many of the sort of Stalwart-like franchised mainstays are there, like the, you know, the items, the idea of parallel worlds.
You know, a lot of all that stuff was really calcified in this, and it just becomes just, it's just this really extravagant adventure that takes you across Hyrule. And it's just beautiful in terms of its scope, its design, its music, its characters, the interactions. And yeah, really, I could see why it ultimately became the blueprint for all the Zelda's that came after it.
And it's fantastic and definitely the best, one of, if not the best game on the SNES, which is why, kind of get off the board first, it does make it a target for a steal, but I think that-
Sure does.
Yeah, I had to get it.
Well, the thing is, I don't think this is like near the top of the pack, near the front of the pack for the Zelda franchise in general. Like I played through this most of the way, and it does have like the big turn, where you go to the dark world, is it, or whatever it is, the sort of like dark version of Hyrule. And that is extremely cool and was probably mind-blowing to experience, and we have recently podcasted about the original Legend of Zelda, and the gulf between this game and that game is fucking enormous.
So that's one factor. I do think this is like slightly diminished with time as a game. Matthew, I was wondering what you thought of that.
It only regularly appears at the top of the best SNES games list. I don't know if it's necessarily the best to play now. My big problem with the Link to the Past is I don't think the dungeons are particularly interesting.
They're kind of a halfway house between straight action gauntlets and maybe having a bit more of a theme which we come to associate with Zelda. You know, maybe like Ocarina of Time forwards and I'm too much of that school of Zelda to really enjoy the dungeons here and it's such a big part of the game. There's so many of them, but incredible vibes, incredible like iconography.
The world's amazing. It's not the top of my Zelda list, but it's definitely attractive to people. Quite dangerous pick.
Yeah.
You know, I think all picks.
I don't know how to play this game now after last time. That's the problem. I don't know what to pick first.
I think it's a reasonable pick. Like you just went for it out of the gates. I think it makes sense, Dave.
I think it's a really strong pick actually. If you look at it in the context of the 16-bit era, which I think we have to do for this draft, it's one of the most polished and refined experiences of that era, like it oozes class. That intro in the rain, if you think about what that was like, I played Link to the Past in the 90s and I was blown away by that rainy intro.
I just never seen that level of cinematic atmosphere on a 16-bit system before. I think if you can put your 16-bit goggles on and play it today, it's still really impressive.
I genuinely think it holds up in a way that even the NES one doesn't for me.
Well, the NES one definitely doesn't. Let me tell you right now, it definitely doesn't. But Ash will probably disagree with that.
But I think the pick slants amazing. I'm not saying it's dated. I'm just saying that in terms of what you do, the dungeons like Matthew says, I think it has been surpassed.
But I think it's still incredibly playable in terms of combat and exploration and everything. The thing I was just going to say was that I think it's a great pick because we didn't have a category for this because there's nothing else that's... There are games that are in this mold, but this is the only one of this quality, and therefore it wasn't worth having a category because this game is so good versus those other adventure games.
So I think that is probably telling on some level. Okay. Well, we come to your first pick, Ash.
Technical question. If I steal Link to the Past, do I have to steal it in the RPG category?
I feel like you should have to because it keeps it clean, and I think it makes a steal too powerful if you don't do that. What do you think, Matthew?
The argument would be that if there's an RPG you really want, you could just put that in free pick.
Yep.
Yes, exactly. So that gives you a bit of latitude. So what are you going to do, Ash?
I mean...
I hope you don't do it now, because if you really took the air out of your scumbaggery by having to caveat it beforehand.
Nothing you say can change what I'm about to do, Dave. I have to listen to my heart on this one. And when we were talking earlier, I was thinking in my head, I don't want to win this draft because I have picked a link to the past because it's just so obvious.
It's a little bit basic bitch, isn't it, Dave? So I'm going to be the bigger man. You know what?
You keep it. You keep it. I'll pick something a little bit more interesting.
Don't you worry.
Let's not get too nice here. This draft, we want the drama. I just watched The Running Man and that's what I want this podcast to be like.
So don't get too nice, Ash. Hey, three and a half stars. It was all right.
But anyway, we're going to take Ash.
So I'm going to get in there before Matthew and go straight to Ash's Cursed Amiga Category and pick Monkey Island to LeChuck's Revenge, which is the best point-and-click adventure game ever made. Knocks it out of the park on every level. Amazing, beautiful visuals, fantastic music, great script, funny, awesome puzzles, builds upon the first game in every single way, and provided an experience that was just completely, completely impossible on the other platforms.
Just like there was nothing else like it. Monkey Island was the reason I got an Amiga to begin with. So I don't think I need to explain much about Monkey Island.
I think everyone knows it. I just wanted to get it first.
You came on this podcast and spoke about it, I believe, when we did that Lucasfilm Adventures episode.
I think that was a good episode. Everyone should listen to that.
It was a delight. Yeah, very enjoyed. I think that was the episode that got remastered, Matthew, by that listener who went in and AI buffed all of Asher's bits to make it sound a bit cleaner.
So I think that's literally, we George Lucas'ed the heck out of that episode.
Added loads of CG jabbers. Actually we didn't, that's just us.
Yeah, Ash shoots first. That's the best I got, sorry.
Brilliant.
Okay, that's a good pick then, Ash. I think that makes sense. So it's a very you pick, I'd say.
I love Monkey Island 2.
I will say that the other revelation I had was I didn't quite understand how powerful the Amiga was. Like, in terms of what it could do, it seemed like it was just almost what PCs were doing but not quite. Was it like quite an affordable machine, the Amiga?
I don't really know much about it.
I think you have to remember that the Amiga came out in 1985. So if you compare what it was doing to 1985 standard PCs, because of course the Amiga got a RAM upgrade of half a megabyte, but it didn't really evolve much in its lifetime, whereas PCs kept building and building. It was way, way ahead of anything else in the market at the time, and it meant by the 90s, it was still able to hold its own.
It was only really when Doom came along that the Amiga started to struggle.
Yeah. I didn't realize actually that people had their own attempts at making Doom-style games on the Amiga. I believe Alien Breed 3D is one of those attempts.
I was reading a bit about that. So yeah, interesting to understand just what it was capable of, because a lot of the coolest PC games from the early 90s did actually launch on the Amiga. I just had no real context for that, to be honest.
So an interesting deep dive for sure. Okay, Matthew, we come to your first pick.
Oh, God. What do I do? Do I lay out my little breadcrumbs, try and tempt you bastards to steal again?
Oh, tempt you bastards. I don't think you ever called us bastards before.
He's losing it. He's losing his grip on the draft.
I mean, we deserve it. It's fair, but, you know.
Do I just take Zelda? Because it's locked in, it's invincible.
I mean, this is a good argument for it.
It didn't work for me last time. I thought stealing right off the bat, getting MGS5.
That's because you picked Ghostbusters, Dave. You picked Ghostbusters and you fucked it.
I won the hearts of the people.
All eight of them who voted for you.
I did really poor, didn't I?
I do it, Matthew. Then it's done, isn't it? You don't care about the RPGs on this platform anyway.
No, it's not entirely true.
It's mostly true, come on.
There's something more important I don't want to lose, so I need to keep my...
You're a big Gino guy, I forgot, sorry.
Gino for Smash. I'm going to get my shittiest pick out of the way first.
Okay.
It's an honest pick. People will howl at this because it's definitely not the right pick, but it's the only one that I can speak to authentically in this genre. For fighting game, I'm going to take Eternal Champions on the Mega Drive.
Wow.
Alright, interesting.
Wow. First pick?
Yeah. Well, this is more because I don't want to be forced to talk about... I can't talk with any authority about any other fighting game.
I can't talk with any authority about Eternal Champions, but this is the fighting game that we can't...
No threat anyone was going to take that.
No, well, I just want to get out of the way because... I might kill it... .I want to see what else goes on the board first.
You've got to play some tactics here. But yeah, we had this game, we played it loads. Like I think in our head, we didn't have Mortal Kombat, we weren't allowed to have Mortal Kombat, but Eternal Champions was kind of, you know, it felt like your budget untalked about version of Mortal Kombat.
It had, you know, fatalities and stage finishes, which were extravagantly violent, which we basically spent our whole time trying to engineer these things. You had to kill people in very specific areas of each stage to make the stage like mangle them up. So you were always kind of trying to make, you know, a guy bounce into a fan or whatever.
All the characters were kind of picked through history. So you started with like a caveman all the way up to a sort of futuristic man who shot buzz saws out of his little wrist cannons. There was a warlock who could make a big green snake go out and bite people.
There was a sort of a vampire man who was burning up in the day and yeah, I'm real fondness for this. We played it loads. I can't speak with any authority about decent games.
I know not to pick classics that I can't speak about because it actually undermines the pick and I saw I refused to pick a better game and lie. So yes, Eternal Champions.
Well that sure is a pick and I do actually understand the attitude of being tentative with your first pick because of the kill and steal rules. So you almost want to kind of like backload your picks as opposed to frontloading them knowing they could come off the board and I think the dynamics of this draft are different to the last one just because of those like really hot categories.
So it became a mess in the last 20 minutes of that draft. It was brutal.
It sure did.
Did you guys see there's an Eternal Champions movie being made?
Is there?
Are you making it Ash?
No, it's being written by Derek Connolly. I don't know that off the top of my head. I was just looking it up.
He wrote most of the Jurassic World films and Detective Pikachu.
Is this like how they made a Werewolves Within movie? And like it's just, it's not an IP anyone recognizes. It's just, you know, was there and cheap.
Once you've seen a 16-bit caveman get thrown into an industrial van, you'll want to see that in For Real Life in a film.
You'll want to see that in IMAX.
You'll want to see Daniel Day Lewis doing that too.
Daniel Day Lewis as the Warlock. Yeah, that would be good.
Kicking entirely with his left foot. I'm glad someone liked that joke.
Oh yeah, okay, I get it. Very good. I feel like I've seen Eternal Champions on like nine different Mega Drive compilations I've owned, but I've never touched it, so I can't really speak to it.
Or if I have touched it, I forgot about it. But I understand, Matthew, it makes sense, your logic there. Okay, so it comes to my first and second picks here.
First up, I'm going to take for sports or racing Neo Turf Masters, a Neo Geo game that says, what if we made golf sexy as fuck with lots of like cool sound effects and visuals and stuff, then we pretended golf was more exciting than it actually is. I went and played this, I went and bought this on the Nintendo Switch to research for this episode. And it is very, very playable, like even compared to other golf games of the time.
And I've played quite a few golf games of the time in recent months because of the podcast we've been doing on Atari games and NES games. So kind of aware of where golf games were at before this.
You're saying this is better than Ninja Golf.
Well, it's true that it doesn't feature the Ninja part of Ninja Golf, Matthew, which is tough. So it doesn't have that novelty factor. But it's just of such high quality in terms of presentation that I think it really wins you over even if you do think that golf is boring as heck.
And it's just really intuitive. There's like a little mini game for when you're really close to the hole and you've got to nail the power. And it's all about…
You really feel like you're in control of how much power you're giving the ball and sort of like the precision of any given shot. And I just think it's a lot less fiddly than other golf games because it boils all the essentials down to the most simple possible version of the thing. This is a great game and you can easily give this a go in your browser by just typing in Play Neo Turf Masters and some illegal website will come up and allow you to do that.
Ash, I'm guessing you have some thoughts on this pick.
Yeah, this is on my list. I love golf games. Don't love golf, but I love golf games like all sane people.
I think there's an argument this is the best golf game of all time. There's some kind of dark art going on in Neo Turf Masters because I think unless you're some kind of game design scientist, I don't think you can truly explain why it feels so good to play, but it really does. I don't know if you know it, Sam, but it was developed by the same people who made Metal Slug.
Yeah. Well, they acquired after a short time as well.
They were acquired after Metal Slug, they got absorbed into SNK, but yeah, they were called Nazca, and those guys came out of IRM who made R-Type. I think when you look at it as, oh, this is a sports game by the people who made Metal Slug, you understand a little bit more of where it was coming from. This is a team that just loves finely tuned arcade mechanics that feel good to play, and there's people who know how to do that or work really hard to achieve that feeling through a process of testing and learning.
There's really nothing else like it, like all the other Neo Geo games, you can pick it up on modern platforms for about six pounds. There's a great mobile version and it works really well on mobile. I think if you love golf games, like you just must play.
Yeah, it's really something, so definitely a bit of a find. I think it came up at a GameScore episode, NeoTurf Masters, and people in the comments were like, you're talking about this game like it's rubbish, when it's actually fucking amazing. And me and Matthew were like, well, we don't know anything about Neo Geo games, so sorry about that.
Welcome to GameScore, motherfuckers.
So I've rectified that now and played it, and now I've picked it here. So such is the continuum of The Back Page podcast. Okay, my second pick.
A point of clarification, actually, is we agreed via email, I assume you chaps still agree to this, that we would count the Mega Drive add-ons as part of the consideration here.
So do we want 32X as it's arguably 32 bit? You know, it's picking a 32X game anyway. What am I talking about?
Well, they're all shy, aren't they? That's the thing. Yeah.
So there's no point.
But we believe in Mega CD.
Well, that's it. So that was definitely part of the discussion we had. And with that in mind, for my category 6 wildcard pick, I'm taking Snatcher on Sega CD, Hideo Kojima.
No, I'll change my mind. We're not allowing Mega CD.
Adventure game, very gnarly, a bit of a rip off of a bunch of things at once, Blade Runner and Terminator. First played this on my PSP years ago when someone in the Imagine office mess with my PSP to get it to do that. This is its only ever English localization, I believe.
So it's not like I'm taking a non-English version here. The voice acting in it is very bad. It definitely feels like the earliest days of this sort of thing.
But it's like a very cool curio to discover if you're a Kojima fan, see some of his sensibilities, like in terms of just how much he lifts from movies and that kind of thing. But the presentation of it is really something. And it is, along with Police Notes, probably should be put in some kind of compilation and re-released at some point.
It has been a few years since I played this in any significant way. We tried to get the listeners to vote on us doing an episode about this, Matthew, behind the paint wall, but they weren't really interested, which is fair enough.
Bold to pick it and in your draft.
Well, basically for a wildcard category, I think it's perfect. And it still feels like the sort of thing I don't think anyone would waste their steal token on. And so it has that thing of like, oh, I quite fancy playing this Hideo Kojima game that has never been re-released.
And I think that probably makes more sense than picking someone out of the gates that gets stolen. So Ash, what do you make of this pick?
Oh, yeah, this is a wonderful, wonderful game, really. A bit of a humble brag. I've got a copy of this game that I bought for what felt like too much money in around 1999 and now feels like an absolute bargain.
This, for me, was my first experience of like Japanese adventure games. I don't know if I would call it a visual novel, but there's a lot of reading a few years before Ace Attorney came along and the genre kind of exploded for us. And it was a real eye-opener to see like a Japanese interpretation of an adventure game, not to mention one that's made by Hideo Kojima.
So it's got all of the kind of the rich overabundance of storytelling and overabundance of imagination and ideas that go into his games, but like filtered through a series of almost entirely just like beautiful still images. It's a game you kind of you want to play in the dark on a on a Sunday evening when it's raining outside and just like soak up the atmosphere. And you like you can you can play it in a day or two if you don't want to rush.
It's about vibes as much as it is anything else. There's not a lot of gameplay to it, but you can just kind of bask in that kind of neon, like Blade Runner vibe of it all and you'll just you'll just feel good. It's a feel good game.
Yeah, Pixel Eye is amazing. Matthew, any thoughts on this pick?
It's funny that you're putting out this early because I hadn't thought of this for Wildcard at all. You know, you could just yoink it and have a pretty good Wildcard.
Snatch it.
That's fine. If you want me to pick Dr. Robotnik's Mean Beam Machine here instead, that's absolutely fine by me, pal. So go right ahead, I say.
Waste your steal token. Okay, what's your next pick, Matthew?
I will go Wildcard. I will not steal Snatcher. I will take another world on the Mega Drive.
Ah, we've definitely talked about this on the podcast before, probably in that 16-bit episode that we did. I was always rubbish at this, a sort of cinematic platformer. I mean, if I was being incredibly generous, I'd try and sell it to you as like a proto limbo or inside, in that it's a lot of trial and error, instant death scenarios, beautifully animated, but I don't think it has the ease of use of a modern inside or limbo.
So it's incredibly frustrating and lots of people may not even get off the opening screen of this where you begin drowning and have to swim to the surface before a load of tentacles come and pull you down into the water. And for a long time, this was just that weird game where you died in a pool of water at the start, but we just didn't even understand how the thing was meant to work. And then once you get out of the pool of water, there are these little slugs that bite your ankles and instantly kill you.
And then there's a giant beast that chases you and instantly kills you. So it was quite hard work. But over time I have come to appreciate it as having these quite grand cinematic ambitions, trying to tell a story wordlessly just through the animation and the scenario, trying to convey what you were meant to do in every moment.
I don't think it's wholly successful. It is still incredibly difficult. I've never finished this game.
But it's definitely worth a watch on a YouTube let's play. There's been various HD re-releases over the years. But I think this is a good example of a Mega Drive oddity.
Though I don't know if it was quite big actually at the time. So maybe it's pushing up against the edges of what a wildcard is.
I think it's actually perfect for this category. Because it is a real one-off, even if it was commercially successful at the time, and I think it was. It is undeniably an influence on those games you mentioned, Matthew.
Like a pretty important game. Dave, did you ever encounter this one?
Only when it was re-released. We covered it on Games TM, I remember. I think on phone, on iOS or on Android or something.
Sorry, I remember.
There was a 15th anniversary PC release that I reviewed.
Really?
Yeah, but maybe it's been re-released so many times, maybe it happened.
Well, that was it. We started to do a lot of phone stuff back then and covered stuff that was getting ported over. So I toured a bit a little bit then.
I didn't play too much, but I'd say like a proto limbo is maybe generous, but fairly accurate. You know, it does have that sort of what I say, sort of like that isolating tone to it, something that kind of feels quite uncomfortable and unsettling as you're playing it quite leaves, it leaves you kind of cold, but there's something very immersive and well realized about the design of the world that you're in and you're exploring that I do find quite appealing. But it's not something I ever heard either.
Yeah, but I never felt like compelled to go back to it.
If people get really stressed out with Another World and Super Cross because the slug has killed them for the 10th time, they can just put it down and enjoy a nice relaxing game of Eternal Champions. That's really the beauty of this collection.
I like this pick. I think it's a genuine original from the time. Even when I played it and I thought it was annoying, I thought if I was a kid playing this, I would have just bashed my head up against it until I did make some progress.
Ash, did you ever take on Another World?
I really love this game. I didn't play it back in the day. I played it when that 15th anniversary version came out.
I was in my late 20s. The struggles that people have had with it, I didn't really have and I found it quite a natural game to play. For the longest time, I held the opinion that Another World should be on the national curriculum in secondary school as a way to teach communication to people.
Because I think one of the remarkable things about Another World is that it communicates so much without any text, without any on-screen HUD. It doesn't have complicated controls. It's a very simple interface.
It communicates all of its ideas and clues about what you are supposed to do purely through visual representation. I think you could study it and learn from it in game design class. I think you could probably learn from it if you are making a film as well.
It's a kind of remarkable game, especially when you look at the era in which it was made. Like it really stands out in the 16-bit era.
What a great pick. Yeah.
I mean, scrap long division and bring in another world education. Vote Ashley Day for Wakefield Constituency. Okay.
Very good. We come to your next pick, Ash.
It's a tricky one because now I'm thinking about Matthew's strategy of leaving his best stuff till last, which I think is quite a good strategy.
Whoa, I've already put my best stuff on the table.
I'm quite right.
Everyone's putting their shit on the table.
Good point.
Fuck you, Dave. Neo Turf Masters absolutely rules. What I remember of Snatcher when I played it 15 years ago was wonderful.
It sounds so.
I love it.
I'd rather rip off as much as the next guy.
The game I'm about to pick, I actually added to my list during this recording when Sam said that there was a lot of great multiplayer games in the 16-bit era. So I'm going to go with Licensed Game, and I'm going to pick Micro Machines 2. Oh, yeah.
Specifically Micro Machines 2 because that was the one with, I think it was called the J Cart. So this is the Mega Drive version I'm picking, and it had an amazing innovation from Codemasters, which was two controller ports built into the cartridge itself. So you could play a four-player game of Micro Machines, this fantastic top-down racer without a multi-tap or anything like that.
There was a strange period in my life where my mum got into video games, and she bought a Mega Drive. This would have been in the early 2000s, I think. And we just played Micro Machines every day for about two months.
Strange but very fond memories for me. I don't know if I need to explain Micro Machines. Top-down racer based on the children's toys, where you race around the surface of a home, tables, a toilet, that sort of thing.
And really simple but quite brilliant gameplay of if you push to the front of the pack and hit the kind of periphery of the screen, forcing other people in the race towards the back of the screen, then you get a point, get enough points and you win the race. A very, very different kind of racing game that I think, I don't know where that idea came from, but kind of genius and not really one that's been seen since outside of some spiritual successors. Did you guys play this?
But yes, I did play this. I always remember this work was to have Violet Berlin in this one, because she was the popular games TV presenter at the time. But this, it's a brutal multiplayer experience, just a real laugh and just have everyone sort of bursting into sort of like angry fits and laughter as sort of kicking people off of pool tables.
Yeah, it's just a massive social game. The J-Card is just an ingenious innovation of its time. And I think this has such a British charm to it as well.
Like it feels so very specifically British in its sort of design and sense of humor and aesthetic that it was on my list. It's a game that I just have a lot of time for and hold on my heart.
Yeah, I don't think I had this one. I think I had the original Micro Machines, but similar principle, I guess. It's like an unstoppable multiplayer formula.
I think it makes total sense. I don't think I even really thought of this as like a licensed game and would have put it more in the racing category. But it's well done.
It's smartly done.
Sam, just quickly, Sam, when you joined Play Magazine, were they still obsessed with Micro Machines when you joined?
I think that might have ended. I remember there was a brief return of Bomberman on the GameCube in the office, but I don't remember a specific Micro Machines.
I remember when I joined Games TM, the guys on Play Magazine played Micro Machines every single lunchtime for about a year. They called it Mic-Max because of course, if you're talking about a game all the time, you have to talk about Mic-Max.
Yeah. I do remember that now, actually. I think that might have been driven by that guy, Luke Smith, who left just as I joined.
Luke Smith, Aaron, yeah, Mic-Max.
Yeah. Aaron had moved to Sci-Fi now by that point, I think, when I joined, so I never experienced the Mic-Max phenomenon of summer 2006. I'm sure it's very exciting in that one office in the Bournemouth area.
Okay. Well, that's a good pick. Matthew, do you have any take on this?
Do you think about Micro Machines at all?
It felt adjacent to Honey O Shrunk the Kids of his Domestic Objects, but really big and that really tickled my child mind at the time. Seeing a racetrack made out of Cheerios, I think it made me think of that.
Good stuff. Well, Dave, we come to your two picks. I don't know if there are two Ghostbusters games you can pick here.
I absolutely fucking could.
Yeah, but I'm not. I'm going to go first one. I want to go with my heart and not with my head on this one.
I'm going to go with the Passion Pick in Licensed. I'm going to go with Mickey Mania. I don't know if you guys played this one.
It's on my list.
Yeah, I really love Mickey Mania. So for anyone who doesn't play it, it's like a platformer in typical Castle of Illusion Mickey Mouse style, but it takes a journey through the iconography of Mickey Mouse, all the way from Steamboat Willie through to the Prince and the Pawper animated movie that he made. So you do these various different stages all based around one of those animated movies or shorts that he was in.
It's just fantastic. The gameplay switches from standard platforming to this great sequence in the moose level where you're running towards the camera and the moose chasing around. You have to avoid it.
They replicated it again in The Lion King with the stampede sequence. This is just really charming and I just love that it's just such a love letter to the history of Mickey Mouse up until that point. I think it could have done with a Christmas chapter, like a Once Upon a Mickey Christmas entry in there, or maybe gone up to the Three Mouseketeers, which is one that I really loved of that generation of Mickey Mouse films.
But this is a really endearing, licensed Mickey Mouse product. I think it's... I much prefer it to the Castle of Illusion period.
I just got back from Disney, so clearly I've got Mickey on the mind.
Yeah. I have not played this specific game, but I have a friend who had the PS1 version of this. And just talked about it so fondly as a great idea to just go through these different ages as a Mickey Mouse platformer that kids can actually play.
So I do like this as a true heart pick.
Oh, I'll tell you some trivia here. The composer on it was Michael Giacchino.
Oh, okay. Interesting. One of your guys.
One of my guys. Fantastic fourth theme tune, Lost. Love it.
Didn't David Jaffe work on this before the war?
Yes, he was the designer on it, yeah.
Matthew, you were actually going to pick this week.
Yeah, this was one of my high up on my license game. It's so beautifully made in terms of mimicking the style of the cartoons. I always thought it was a big mark against Epic Mickey, that the 2D levels inspired by Mickey Mouse cartoons in Epic Mickey were so ugly and crap compared to Mickey Mania.
This game absolutely nailed that whole look and that whole style. So yeah, we played this loads back in the day. Really great.
Warren Spector owned this podcast.
So sorry, mate.
Okay, Dave, what's your next pick?
I'm going to go in side-scroller or shooter, Contra 3. Now I have a bit of recency bias on this because it's on the SNES Mini. On quite a few occasions, I've had a friend drowned where we've ordered big greasy burgers and had beers and played co-op on Contra 3.
It's just been great. I mean, I'm sure everyone has played it. You're just rampaging through levels with giant guns, blasting shit out of people.
You're firing missiles at giant tanks. You've got big Terminator-style exoskeletons bursting through the wall. We have to blow up.
You've got-
Big tortoise.
Yeah, big tortoise. You've got some really fucking annoying platforming levels where you're hanging off of steel girders and those are things that are attacking you from the sky and you have to avoid. It almost feels impossible to beat.
Thankfully, with the SNES Mini, you can, you know, checkpoint, save, and rewind back. Otherwise, I don't think I ever would have got through it. But this is just, like, I think a very quintessential shmup for me.
It's just- It's just fun, chaotic, extreme, violent, and it's just so much fun with two players. I've had a great time.
The whole sort of gritty 80s commando Arnie-esque aesthetic is just really in my wheelhouse.
Yeah, I've not really played this one, but it comes up quite frequently on best SNES games lists, and so it must be pretty beloved. This is actually a pretty great little kind of category. There's a lot of stuff kind of vying for attention here.
Some truly amazing pies for side-scrolling shooters especially. There's loads of them. Well, actually, and beat-em-ups, but that kind of bleeds a bit more into the license category, I think.
So yeah, a good choice. Ash, were you thinking of taking this one?
Actually, no. This was nowhere near my list. I think I got possibly a little hung up on whether run-and-gun games count as shooters, but I think Contra legitimately does.
Yes, an awesome game, great co-op game, looks amazing, hard as nails, but hard as nails in a good way. Some games are hard in a bad way, Contra is hard in a good way.
I'd say it only has one cheap sequence, which is the one I was on about where you're going along the steel girders and you're getting tacked from the sky by all sorts of weird dinosaur things. Other than that, it's fairly balanced.
It's totally learnable as Contra. Like all great arcade games, you can play it over and over again, keep getting better to the point where you can legitimately do it in one credit, if you're that good.
Well, we come back to you, Ash, for your next pick.
Oh, okay.
You always sound like a man who's unprepared for the fact this is a draft. Maybe you can tune in to the conversation about the draft.
Matthew's the same. If Tommy's like, Oh my God, what do I do?
That's just part of his Jack Lemmon routine that he does during these episodes.
Let me say, I'm really struggling with this draft. Not because I can't think of anything. It's just every category has got tons of legit stone cold picks.
I mean, when you look at sports or racing and you've got six great games on your shortlist, you know you're in trouble. Everything I have to ruminate over.
I just feel like we're also all being very cautious after last time of picking something too good too early. There's definitely a bit of that. Sorry, Snatcher.
Snatcher's a great pick for Wild Card. Let's see what your Wild Card looks like.
Okay, so.
That's what it fucking FIFA 95 is going to be your Wild Card.
I'm going to go Wild Card. I think I've chosen this game on a previous episode, but so be it. For Wild Card, I'm going to go Comic Zone.
I had that on my end.
Which you could call a scrolling beat them up as well. I think it is a scrolling beat them up, but I think it deserves to be in the Wild Card category because it does something. Basically, no other game has really done, which is the entire game takes place inside the pages of a comic, and it has tons of fun with that concept.
So instead of scrolling left or right, you can make your way through the comic panels. If you are going left or right, you leap out of the panel around the border of the page and into another panel. So even though it was a 2D game, it felt not three-dimensional, but it had some dimensionality to it.
You could then drop and hang from the panel above and drop into the panel below.
You could kick enemies through panels and split it.
Yes, you can. They burst through the page. You can tear a bit of the page off and turn it into a paper plane and throw it.
It has tons of fun with the concept. Really late Mega Drive game. I think it was like 95, 96, made by Sega Technical Institute in America, who were quite an experimental bunch.
I think kind of overlooked because it was a late game at the time, but I think has come back around in later years because it's been repeatedly included in Sega Mega Drive compilations, virtual console. I think people have discovered this game over time and they either bounce off it because again, it's hard as nails. I don't think I've ever got past the third or fourth stage on it.
I've never finished it. But the ingenuity of it and that comic panel format, which encourages non-linear exploration, tons of secrets to find, it is a game you can play over and over again and find new things. I think this is a game people keep discovering and most have a good time.
What do you guys think of it?
I don't really like it that much, to be honest.
But it is divisive.
Wildcard is a great place for it because it does look amazing. And I think for a kid as well, it's a kind of idea that just fires up your imagination. So I think Wildcard is a perfect place for it.
Matthew, what do you think?
I think conceptually brilliant. And I think when you pick it up now, especially if you've never played it, you are bowled over by just how clever it is and feels very meta and ahead of its time. I think if you strip away that cladding, is the game underneath actually much cop?
Maybe not, but style gets you quite far.
It's all style. It's the same reason Ash loves the terrible Ang Lee Hulk movie.
I do love the panels in Ang Lee's Hulk.
I bet you do. No, I actually agree with Ash. I think it's really strong.
I think that the gameplay beneath the aesthetic framing is a little wobbly, but it's undeniable in its appeal and elevates it. It's very funny as well. I think it has a decent sense of humor to it.
I remember it being a big deal when it came out. Maybe it's because I'm a bit younger than you, Ash. Because it was definitely a game that was passed around the playground a lot when I was a kid.
I don't know if you ever got to the end of it, but it's pretty cool. The final boss battle is in a stage that's half-sketched out because he's got to the end of the comic that he gets sucked into and he hadn't finished yet. So you get this half-sketched arena for the final boss battle where we've nowhere to go.
And I like that little touch to it. But yeah, I love this game.
Just on the difficulty of Comic Zone, this just came back to me. There are no continues in Comic Zone and there are no lives. You have one life.
And then if you die, that's it. You're back to the beginning. However, occasionally, once in every 10 times, if you die, the villain who is like duck-a-muck style drawing enemies into the comic for you to fight, he'll take pity on you and give you an extra life.
Which I think that's kind of a fun idea, but ultimately it did make it brutally difficult because you just had to memorize this entire game because there were no lives and no continues. Good game, though.
Good game.
Vote for it.
All right. Well, a great wild card pick, certainly. We come back to you, Matthew.
Let's get Cursed Amiga Category out of the way. Quite a lot of things to pick here. Monkey Island 2 is a great pick from Ash, but I think I'm going to put up against it, maybe the only other point-and-click game which I think could sway people, certainly would sway me.
I'm going to take Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis. One of my favorite games as a kid, even though it came on whatever 12 discs, it was an absolute nightmare to play, but brilliantly captures all the different aspects of Indiana Jones. It was a point-and-click game that famously splits into three paths after the first act, and you can play a co-op puzzling act with your female sidekick.
You can go the brains route, which is just very difficult puzzles, or there's the fist route, which has got a terrible fighting system, I think terrible fighting system, where you click on various Nazis to sort of punch them in the face. Imagine just trying to fight people with a point-and-click interface, and it's every bit as terrible as it sounds. I never finished that route of the game, but at a time when Indiana Jones was still just, you know, three, I think, great films, this was so exciting.
This felt like the fourth film, and I think there were talks at times of like, oh, maybe this would become the fourth Indiana Jones, and this was definitely what I had in mind when they were like, they're making another Indiana Jones film, what is that worth? It's going to be like Fate of Atlantis, it's going to be absolutely amazing. So you know, making a game which can slot into that lineage of films is no small feat.
But you know, until The Great Circle came along, my probably my favorite Indiana Jones non-film thing, but yeah, still excellent.
Dave, do you ever play Fate of Atlantis?
You know what? I actually haven't, which is weird. It's sort of one of those iconic licensed games that I've never touched.
I really want to. I would say its reputation is even sort of surpassed that of the young Indiana Jones Chronicles in terms of its story telling and sort of place among the sort of expanded universe of canon.
Oh, it's way better than that shit.
Yeah, it's good. It's good. It's good waffling by DaveGBT, but I'm not sure it quite passes the taste test.
It's hallucinating.
I should have played it. Just tell you later.
I wouldn't say the young Indiana Jones Chronicles were the one to beat.
I would. I watched it. I used to love that shit.
I watched it since I was like 10.
Yeah, I watched it too. I bought those things on freaking VHS. I had loads of that shit.
Old Sean Patrick Flannery.
Yeah, Harrison Ford was there playing the saxophone.
I remember.
I played this for an episode we did on Indiana Jones about two years ago when Diana Destiny came out. And it's dated more than some of the other LucasArts adventures, I'd say, but undeniably Indiana Jones in feel and sound and all that stuff. And if you want a little bit more of that than the films that the original trilogy can give you, then it's good for that.
I don't think it's like best in class in a genre or anything. But, you know, well, it's not. I'm sorry, but it's not.
But Ash, where do you think it stands next to the other LucasArts games? Assuming that people haven't listened to that episode we actually did. Well, you ranked these for us.
I am in danger of repeating myself. But yeah, it was great. I never played this on the Amiga.
I played the Wii version, which was a free bonus on the very terrible Staff of Kings game. But you could play it on the Wii with the Wii Remote acting like a mouse and it was a great experience. That was an adaptation of the CD-ROM version, which had actually pretty good voice acting as well.
That didn't have that on the Amiga though, so we can't use that to praise Matthew's pick. But yeah, this is legendarily good. Great Indiana Jones game.
This would have been a great pick on the licensed game as well. And yes, I think a really good argument for being one of the best LucasArts games, particularly the replayability that it had.
All right, well good stuff. Comes back to me for two picks. I feel like I've not picked for about four hours doing this, but such is the case with doing these episodes.
So the pressure mounts.
Yeah, I guess so. I mean, yeah, what will I take off next? Okay, let's do licensed game.
And I'll take Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for Turtles in Time. Considered an all-timer arcade conversion. Absolutely killer Konami generation 16-bit.
So many fucking amazing games. Very tight, sort of one, two race between this and Batman Returns and the SNES, which is another Konami game. Both really good because they are size-scrolling beat-em-ups that perfectly capture the tone of the material.
And that's definitely true here. This has the kind of like goofy charm of the Saturday morning cartoon. And so it feels like the right pick for licensed game.
There's a little bit of opportunism and I think that people voting will like this as a pick, for sure. Played all the way through Shredder's Revenge when that came out a couple of years ago, which I think is this game as you remember it rather than this game as it feels to play in 2025. It's definitely a lot slicker, feels a lot more modern.
But I think considering what they were working with hardware-wise as an arcade port, this is still really impressive. I can see why it had this big cultish appeal on the SNES and why it's so beloved. So yes, it feels like a strong choice for this.
Ash, you are the Turtles guy.
What do you think of this? Yes. I am the Turtles guy.
I love Turtles. I would say it's better than the arcade version. It's significantly different to the arcade version and improves on it in a number of ways.
It's flashier. It's got that kind of, you know, that move where you can like throw enemies like into the screen using like those great road 7 effects. It's one of those games that like, you know, the kind of Games TM and Retro Gamer era where you'd use an emulator to take a screenshot of the game and blow it up to a full DPS to show that you love old games.
Like Turtles in Time was one that got used loads because it just looked like amazing in like DPS vision. So that's, you know, if you're a magazine editor, it's got an audience of dozens in that regard. Yeah, really, really good fun.
As Turtles games go, it's probably in like the top three, to be honest, for whatever that is worth. Yeah, I've got a lot of fun memories of it.
Where does this fall? I don't know. I don't know.
I won't say the name because it might come up, but like for you, Ash, where does this sort of rank against the other big Turtles game of this era? There's no tournament fighters.
Well, there's not tournament fighters. It's the best one of this era, is Turtles in Time.
You think so?
Definitely.
Eat it, Dave.
Yeah, closely followed by the original arcade game.
Nice. Well, there you go. Fuck you, Dave.
That's what we've heard.
No, I love Turtles in Time. I just slightly prefer Hyperstone Heist, but that's because Hyperstone Heist was the one that I had.
I mean, that's like a Mega Drive kind of loops adaptation. It's good. It's really good.
Exactly.
It must have been a treat as a kid at the time, loving Turtles to just find this game that takes it so seriously and pays homage to it and doesn't feel incongruous, just feels like it captures the spirit so perfectly. It really is like a blockbuster of its day. It's pretty palpable.
I love Turtles. I was as much Turtles guy. Me and Ash occasionally do text about Turtles.
You read The Last Ronin, Dave? Is that a thing you've done?
I haven't read The Last Ronin. I'm very aware of it, though.
The Watchmen of Turtles comics.
Yeah, it feels a little bit... I'm more of an animated series guy. But I was excluded from school, primary school.
I had to move schools because some kid on the playground kept charging me like a bull in the playground. And I screamed at the top of my voice, Turtle Power, and grabbed him and threw him over my shoulder and cracked his head open. And he had to go to hospital.
Oh my God. So I had to move schools.
Wow.
You're the bad guy in that story.
Yeah, you're not the hero, Dave. And you successfully sued Kevin Eastman, is that correct? Off the back of that?
The lawsuit is still ongoing. It's like the Huey Lewis and Ray Parker Jr. case. It's just still quietly bubbling over in the background through many decades.
Dave, that story is haunting me because... You were that kid. No, the movie Turtles 2 is the only movie in my life I have sat through in the cinema after cracking my head open in the car park.
That's right.
We've talked about this. Blood pouring down my head, which may have had a long-term effect on me, so maybe there's...
What is Yunji Ito's stories you two are bringing up about fucking Turtles?
That kid whose head cracked open, they had to remove his brain and put it in a robotic body and it became a crank.
Can't top that joke. It's time to move on. Very good, Matthew.
That's the way you get paid the big bucks for this podcast. Jesus. I eat 100 pounds more than me.
Okay. Well, next up then, I might as well do my Amiga category pick. I'm going to take Dune II, a revolutionary RTS game made by Westwood Studios.
Nothing to do with the original Dune game that was released earlier. I was pretty impressed by how good this looked and sounded on Amiga. I was watching a long play of it earlier.
You really do see what becomes Red Alert, Age of Empires, everything else off the back of this game. I would have been very excited to own a computer that could run this as a young lad. I imagine it was very exciting at the time.
It is, in theory, faithful to the source material. It looks like a Dune game, but all of the barks and stuff like that are pure command and conquer. Just blokes going, Acknowledged!
Acknowledged! So I would say it's marginally less immersive as a Dune experience than the Denis Villeneuve films, for example.
Does anyone say fear is the mind killer?
There's a massive mentat meter at the top of the screen when you're playing this. But otherwise the fundamentals look pretty similar to what would become Command and Conquer. And let's face it, Command and Conquer with its or and all the rest of it, Tiberian, it's all pretty similar to Dune in make up.
And I don't think I realized that until doing some research for an episode a couple of years ago and realizing, oh yeah, the fundamentals of Dune are basically, you know, underpin all of what Command and Conquer goes on to be. So here it is. I have no idea if any of you have played this.
Yes. Okay, Ash, what do you think of this?
Yeah, I played this back in the day. I also played it a couple of years ago. I covered it on the blog and it still holds up really well.
I'm not a massive RTS guy, but I played Command and Conquer like everyone else. And I got my Amiga in 96. So like when Command and Conquer was big and I didn't have it and I didn't have a PlayStation or a PC, I could go home and play June 2 and not feel, you know, sometimes you played the Amiga equivalent of a popular game.
You played, I don't know, Zool and tried to convince yourself it was as good as Sonic the Hedgehog. But with June 2, like you were getting the real deal, like it created the genre and remains really vital because of that. Yeah, I think it's a good pick.
Yeah, it feels like it's, I wanted to pick something that was more in my wheelhouse. Like I was looking at Turrican and I just couldn't make a convincing case for it without having played it and having that experience built in. But I know what these games are all about, so it feels a bit more authentic for a category where I'm massively out of my depth.
Who is the Tanya of Dune 2?
Do you have an answer to that, Ash? Do you know who the Tanya of Dune 2 is?
Who would you cast the Tanya of Dune 2?
Well, it would have to be basically a sort of a borderline soft porn actress of the time basically. So I don't know who that would be in the early 90s. Oh, right.
Yeah, not really sure. Can't really see it. The Spice Girls video, Say You'll Be There has big Dune energy.
I'll say that. So maybe Mel C could be Tanya and that works. On that note, we move on Matthew to your next pick.
Let's finish off and lock in License Game. I'm going to take Aladdin, but which Aladdin am I going to take? SNES or Mega Drive?
Mega Drive he'll take because he'll like the fucking pretty visuals. That's what you're all about.
I'm going to take Mega Drive. Well, I think fundamentally the designer of the Mega Drive version, Dave Perry, is a better game designer than who made the SNES one.
Isn't it Shinji Mikami?
Oh yeah, Shinji Mikami.
Who turned to him?
Big path of Neo Geo is there Matthew.
Obviously, yeah, I know Shinji Mikami made the SNES one and that you had these two very different takes on the same game. Maybe the Mega Drive one is a little bit sort of shallower but incredibly pretty. This was like, you know, if I have an era of Disney where I was sort of into it, it would have been, you know, the kind of Aladdin years.
I loved that film at the cinema. To me, the game absolutely captured it. Watching it back on YouTube now, like in my head, this is a game which has the full orchestral soundtrack of Aladdin, which obviously isn't true.
It's a sort of Mega Drive doing a little farty, bleepy, bleepy version of A Friend Like Me. I think the fantasy of these things and why this particular era of these games sticks so fondly in a lot of people's minds was having a thing that you loved at the cinema or something that was big in your life and then having something which did kind of accurately capture it and capture all the beats of it and let you do a magic carpet ride and go through the desert town and fight the big boss at the end. You know all the classic beats of Aladdin.
I just had sort of fondness for it. I sort of weighed up the other Disney Mega Drive games. I was quite into Quack Shot and World of Illusion, which was like the co-op Mickey Mouse game, but Aladdin was the one which I played the most.
So I'm going to take that and hope other people also had a fondness for this film.
I think this was my third pick here. I think like you I just remember how nice this looked and you know it's that kind of carries you carries you far, but it was a it was a cool game and you know we discussed as many times that some of these licensed games were the big blockbusters of their time and this was huge. This movie was huge.
It was a massive deal. I think it's a solid pick Matthew.
So I had to play the Toy Story game on Mega Drive. I know it's on one of my sprites. Yeah.
Donkey Kong Country.
But that sounds bad.
It wasn't great.
No, it was good.
No, no, genuinely it was great. It had these like first person sections in the innards of the crane machine.
Yeah, you had to grab the green aliens from the inside of the claw machine. Yeah, yeah, it had top down racing.
Coming day free pick.
It wasn't. It's in my wild card. I'm not going to take it.
Because all the other ones have been taken. So I can say that. But yeah, it had 3D racing segments, had top down racing segments.
It was a lot more than just a platformer. And it felt very visually ahead of its time. But yeah, maybe it's a bit janky now.
I haven't played it in however many years, 30 years.
Okay. Well then, we come back to you Ash, for your next pick.
Toy Story.
Definitely, definitely not Toy Story. I'm going to go RPG. And I think it would be a surprise to nobody.
I'm going to pick Shining Force 2 on the Mega Drive. Fantastic, tactical RPG. A time when this was really the only tactics RPG around in this country.
We didn't have Fire Emblem yet. Final Fantasy Tactics hadn't come out yet and didn't come out in this country. We didn't get Tactics Ogre.
Like this was it and made it quite a novel experience at the time. Basically taking the RPG and turning the battles into a game of chess, but with fantastical, magical characters, including a phoenix called Peter. Very good game, but not very imaginative when it came to character names.
We kind of found out years later that Shining Force was quite a different tactical RPG to its peers. Once we had played Tactics Ogre and Fire Emblem, you realize the Shining Force series takes a lot more from the likes of Dragon Quest, like it's got town exploration, you can all get in a little caravan and cross a world map together and explore the world map. It's made by people who cut their teeth making Dragon Quest games on the NES, and then they went and made a completely different type of RPG on the Mega Drive.
So it's got that kind of humor and beautiful visual quality to it that came from that world, but with a totally kind of fresh and original combat style for the time. I'm totally biased. This is my favorite game series of all time.
Don't know what to say other than it's a really good game. If you like tactics games and you've never played the Shining Force games, they're on various compilations now. I would highly recommend going back to them.
And I think the nature of kind of turn-based tactics is that actually, they don't age very badly at all. You can go back to a 16-bit tactics game. And you're going to have largely the same experiences you would have playing a modern one because all of the fundamentals are there right from the start.
The Saturn one is still trapped in limbo, isn't it, Ash? That's not been brought back in any form, is it?
Yeah, that's probably never coming back, sadly. That is the best one. Saturn one's the best one.
But Shining Force 2 is very, very good and widely available.
I did expect this series to come up in some form. I know you're very fond of it. That makes sense.
Dave, we come to your next two picks.
We're getting to that period now where it's like there's some big games on the board and it's who's going to go first.
They sure are, pal. They sure are.
I'm going to still take the Coward's Way out. I'm going to go in wild card because that's a safe category, and I'm going to take Echo the Dolphin.
Oh, really?
Yeah. I mean, it's a wild card, right?
You take it, Dave.
I mean, I'm going to.
It's all yours, mate.
I'm going to. I think it's as iconic and comparable to Comic Zone, Snatcher and Another World in terms of impact and affection.
You're having a laugh. Dave, which version are you taking?
What do you mean, which version? I have the Mega Drive version. Is there another version?
Sega CD's got nicer audio.
It's got better music.
Well, which... I mean...
You take Mega CD, you win this draft.
Sure. I'll take the Mega CD version.
Take Echo Junior, Dave. You'll win the draft off the back of that, for sure.
Does anyone know what the fuck you're even doing in this game? You're just going around grabbing big jewels. I don't know.
You swim endlessly, not really knowing what you were doing. So it really was sort of like...
I played loads of this game, Dave. Would you like me to give some context here? Because I do remember what happens.
You touch the things, it creates an echo, you gain powers, you go to the next area.
But how does the game start? How does the game start? It's like the most memorable thing about this game is the way it starts.
You drop into the ocean.
You jump into the sky and some fucking alien thing, like with fucking, basically seizure-inducing light flashes, like pulls all of the ceiling into the sky.
That's right, they all flip up into the sky.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then there's some horrible, sad music that plays afterwards. You have to go look for your little pod.
That's how the game, that's like the premise of the game, basically.
Yes, and then at the end, obviously you have the giant alien head that's like just nightmaring juicing and sort of allowed every child to experience like pre-pubescent existential dread. So yeah, fantastic. So yeah, just like I used to swim around a bit, spend an hour not really know what I'm doing, touch some gems, get lost in sort of like this endless underwater maze, occasionally jump out the water, do like a nice little dive back in.
And then I'd use cheat codes, skip ahead and see what else was about. And that was my experience. But nonetheless, iconic, original, unique.
There was no other game like it at the time. And I think despite its sort of obtuse nature and somewhat nightmarishly dark undertones, it was something that I think for a whole generation of Mega Drive owners was very iconic and memorable and beloved. So that's why I picked it.
I think this is a genuinely iconic Sega Mega Drive game. I'm not saying it's like one of the best games, but I do think that a lot of people played this. I think the music was very, very good and embedded itself in your brain.
Even if the game itself was obtuse, like you say, is a good way of putting it way too hard just for the amount of oxygen you have to survive when you go underwater. Such a weird thing. Yeah, it's sort of preposterous and even playing it as an adult, I found it just very, very frustrating.
And like you, I did have a second-hand copy of this and someone had put all the cheat codes in the booklet inside the back of the manual. So I used it to jump between all the different bits of the game. And yes, I saw the big alien head at the end, which was fucking terrifying.
And some of the other weird shit in this, like the pterodactyl that grabs you and then chucks you into a different part of the level.
Yeah, so you move between different parts of the stage. It's weird. It's a bizarre game.
There's a bit with a giant blue whale. It's fucking enormous. Honestly, you will get the same value as us at this game.
If you just type in Echo the Dolphin Scary into Google Images, and then you'll just see all the things that gave me and Dave existential terror. So, yes. Ash, did you have a take on this?
I mean, this is an undeniably popular game. Everyone loved it. And I think part of its appeal was that this was a game parents could happily buy for their kids, knowing they were going to get a good game, but without any violence in it.
No guns, no stabbings, no punching. On the surface, it looked like a very kind of pleasant, beautiful, non-violent game, bit of an environmental theme, which was really big at the time. This is the era of Captain Planet, for example.
And little did they know of the horrors that awaited with the big scary alien head at the end, but too late, they bought it by them.
Yeah, for sure. But I got this instead of Altered Beast. I think Altered Beast would have scarred me less, to be honest.
Do you remember when Dave got kicked out of that school for spraying another boy with water from his blowhole?
That's screaming dolphin power.
Yeah, he used a sonar to push a jewel into his head, if I remember correctly. Yeah, okay, very good.
He was echoing that scenario. He was coming at me and charging and headbutting me in the mid-drift.
Anyway, Dave is true authentic working class. There's no doubt about that. What's your next pick, Dave?
In sports or racing, I'm going to take it. I'm going to go Mario Kart. It's a real basic bitch choice, but again, an undeniable iconic game of this era.
Quintessential sit down and play with your mates, multiplayer fodder. Again, I didn't have a SNES, so this was the game we sort of always put on first when I went around my mate Dan's house. Yeah, I mean, obviously, it's the start of one of the most enduring and popular video game series of all time.
A lot of the levels, a lot of the tracks, simple in design as they seem now, back then, felt very elaborate and you could learn in them, and understanding how to take each corner, how to get the edge on your mates was very important to my life as a young child. And yeah, I love the Mario Kart series and you know, from these humble beginnings did some incredible gaming experiences grow from so yeah, I'm going for it. Just taking this, this big one, this behemoth.
Gonna fire out a hot take here and say that if I was gonna pick one of the two big Nintendo racing games, I'd take F-Zero on SNES over this. I think F-Zero holds up better.
Someone still can.
Fast and beautiful looking. I personally, I find this very hard to play and enjoy.
Because of the Canberra movie rather than the player.
Well, it's also, it's just the way it looks in general and feels like it's, I think it's the first game everyone played when they got the SNES Classic. And then everyone just had the same experience of Bummer Town. Once they just remembered how limited it was compared to what came next.
I pushed back against that because of, I found it, again, this is-
Because I picked it in this round. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I mean, this was a game that was very easy for my kids when I was a bit younger to play with me when I got the SNES Mini, versus something like Contra, which they obviously can't play, or Street Fighter. This was the game that we, and even Donkey Kong Country, this was the game that we played a lot of together because it was very simple, much like all Mario Kart games are, for them to pick up, play, get it, understand it, and just be able to compete, at least semi-competently. And so I think it holds up in that regard.
And it's why I've still got a lot of time for it because it is something that I have returned to a lot in recent years playing with them. So, yeah.
And it had multiplayer over F-Zero, right? F-Zero was single player only, and Mario Kart was designed from the start as this two player game. And that's why you've got like the power ups that are in there.
So it's a very competitive two player game. And like, essentially it invented a genre. It's hard to...
We take it for granted now, that Mario Kart's so established as an institution. But I can clearly remember Mario Kart coming out and thinking that that was the most like, out there, crazy idea, like to turn a platform game into a racing game. Just seemed crazy, but it worked so well that we now just accept it.
Yeah. We wouldn't have had the iconic Atari Karts without it, so that's something.
If it's not open world, I ain't interested when it comes to Mario Kart.
Yeah, Matthew, what is your take on this as a pick?
I think it's quite a good draft pick. I think a lot of people have such fondness for it that they'll just see it and go, yeah, great. If anything, that and Legend of Zelda, like Dave is building, you know, a reasonably dangerous collection of games there.
Yes, I've picked three off the SNES mini I've just realised.
Yeah, you know, if it gets too many, you can only steal and kill so much. So there is that. I do find it quite hard to go back to now.
At least it has its own movement. You know, it's a very distinct game to play compared to 3D Mario Kart. And I guess that's like a tick in the protocol.
But yeah, I can't say I'm like desperate to play. I just play Mario Kart 8 or World, you know, I think is what would happen these days. But if you want to force your young relatives to play this horrible old Mario Kart, go for it.
Well we are about to pass the halfway point in the draft. And from this point onwards, as the evening is, as we near the two-hour recording mark, I will stop asking people what they think of the picks and we'll probably just fire through them to speed things up. Unless we get to some really juicy bits, then we'll stop and talk about those.
I think that makes sense. A bit of draft hygiene. So with that bit of podcast admin cleared up, Matthew, I think it's a perfect time for a quick break and some music before we come back with the rest of the draft.
Welcome back to the podcast. So now for the rest of the picks. We come back to Ash for his next pick.
No messing, let's get real. Platformer, Sonic 2.
There it is, how to happen eventually.
This is, you know, Sonic Tuesday. This was an event in the 90s, quintessential 90s 16-bit game. Are there better platformers of this era?
Perhaps, but are there more like iconic and meaningful games of this era? I don't think so. Like, Sonic 2 was like the game everyone was waiting for.
And in my opinion, it lived up to the hype. Fantastic, fast, colorful game, added tales and therefore a kind of a very soft co-op mode, which we got a lot of use out of. And amazing bonus levels.
The bonus levels in Sonic 1 are absolute poop and house. But the half-pipe tunnel thing in Sonic 2, you wanted to get to those bonus levels because it looked like nothing else at the time. Still love playing this today.
Probably the best Sonic game.
Yeah, it's a terrific game. I think I would pick this above any of the Mario's on this platform. I'm sorry, on the SNES, to be honest.
I think it's... I personally prefer it. It certainly looks nicer.
I think it's the most enjoyable to pick up and play now, although it's like tied with the other Sonic games to that. I would have considered... Would you have considered Sonic 3 and Knuckles if you could have had them as a pair, Ash?
Hmm, didn't really think about that, but I've barely played Sonic 3. So I had Sonic and Knuckles, but not Sonic 3, which was a strange experience. So yeah, Sonic 2 is the one for me.
Imagine if you picked Sonic 3 for one category and Sonic and Knuckles for another category and then connected them together. That would be amazing drafting, but only if the two categories are next to each other on the list.
Well, I believe I have now picked four Mega Drive games, so I think my chances of doing that are slim.
Finally get to get some good SNES stuff.
Yeah, onto the Neo Geo now.
Okay, we come back to you, Matthew.
Let's throw down with Team Mario opposite Sonic the Hedgehog 2. I'll go with Super Mario World. May not be as, for platformer that is, may not be as pretty as Sonic.
Definitely Sega has that on its side. But is, I would say, actually kind of is a platformer game compared to whatever Sonic is. Just a much more playable, much more thoughtful game.
Incredible mastery and control over that character to get through the basic levels, but then eke out secret exits and all the hidden stuff in the world. I think Super Mario World still holds up. I probably play it over most of the 2D Marios that followed, as in the New Super Mario Bros.
series, which I always thought was a little bit anemic compared to this. It has a real identity. The music is absolutely amazing.
Get a little bit of Yoshi action.
That sounds true.
You guys, or maybe Team Sonic, but I think a lot of people like Super Mario World.
Well, I think Dave's team, Team Mario, but I don't know.
No, I'm actually Sonic 2 on this out of the two for sure.
I just think this game has pretty like mid pixel art. I don't even think it looks as nice as Mario 3.
I think that is fair, but it's a much better technical platformer, I think.
It's not Sonic. That's basically the angle.
I don't want to be as crass as the old Sonic is just hold right to win or whatever, but it's closer to the truth than it would be from Hario.
I think that's true of the modern Sonic games. I don't think that's true of these games, which I think they're pretty rich with secrets themselves, the Sonic games of this era. Quite a lot to find in those different levels, different paths, different secret lives and such hidden away.
But this is a classic 1990s argument. I think the thing is that I feel like Sonic 2 is a slam dunk pick in the way that I don't. Super Mario World on paper looks good, but I just don't have the same conviction.
That's why I didn't actually even have it in my...
I think the more important debate here, now that both Sonic and Mario is gone, is which Bubsy game is Dave going to take?
Yes, I look forward to that. I mean, it's good drafting, Matthew, because certainly people will look at the list and be like, yeah, there it is, there's Mario. It will be next to your name, which makes perfect sense in the eyes of the listeners.
Unless someone steals it or kills it.
Indeed, we can't rule that out. Well, I guess now we're breaking out the really hot genres. I guess I will take for category 2 RPG Chrono Trigger on the SNES because it is my favorite RPG on that platform, even though there are other terrific RPGs on that platform.
This is a genre with an amazing generation of stuff to choose from for this draft. So there's no shortage of other cool things that are on the board, but and also The Legend of Zelda, which is not an RPG, but nonetheless. I guess you do play a role in it.
So Dave's got a technicality there, but hey-ho.
You can name your character.
What does ChatGPT tell me?
Basically an immersive sim. Oh dear. Okay.
So yeah, Chrono Trigger, a game set across multiple timeframes. The world is destroyed and you basically have to figure out, jumping across time back and forth, how to stop it from happening. And in doing so, recruit a rag-tag bunch of misfit characters, including a frog man, a prehistoric lady, all designed by Toriyama with that very distinctive visual style.
It's basically like a merging of the sensibilities behind Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. That was very much the big sell at the time of, it's the, you know, these brains put together to make this amazing game, Ushihari and Sakaguchi. And the result is an end of the Generation Stunner.
It looks amazing. It sounds amazing. It's quite a simple RPG really in terms of the combat.
A lot of it's about combining character abilities together to kind of amplify the effects of those different abilities. But really I think the appeal of it is just the nature of cause and effect and going to the far future and seeing it's been destroyed and then going to the distant past and seeing there's a floating island and then getting deeper into the game and that island when basically like what happens to your world in the future happens to them in the past as well and their reality is completely broken by this evil entity. And so I think this game is unbelievably good, had a great DS port, I assume at some point they did a pixel remaster of it, but it's a stellar pick.
So there it is Ash, I'm guessing you also like this game.
Great pick, I am right now looking at my little Chrono Trigger statues that I bought from Square Enix and apparently now very rare and they would be valuable if my daughter hadn't pulled all the swords off their arms. So be it. Yeah, absolutely love Chrono Trigger, it's brilliant.
Well thank you very much for that validation, I appreciate it. And while we're here I guess, let's pick something else that's quite desirable and for category seven free pick I'll take Super Metroid. There it is.
I imagine we're all going to be breaking out the kills and steals very shortly, so look forward to that carnage going down. But in the meantime, this hugely influential, beautiful looking and sounding game, very atmospheric, yet extremely influential on basically one of the reasons that an entire genre sort of kicks off. I mean it already happened before this, but this is kind of like the apotheosis of the series in terms of just the sheer feel of it, the sheer presentation.
Really, really good. And I will admit to not having finished this game, trying and not failing, but abandoning several playthroughs a few hours in on multiple Nintendo platforms. But no denying what it's good at in terms of that, there's a door that's closed here, but later on you get something that could open that door, you go back and then progress, progress, progress.
It's just slightly before there are many more games on its corner, but it's still considered an all-time classic. And I really want to get one of the big Nintendo-made Nintendo games in this draft. So here it is, Matthew Thoughts.
Yeah, I absolutely love Super Metroid. Obviously we've been prepping for our big Metroid episode in December. I've replayed just about every Metroid this year in preparation for that.
So yeah, trying to work out exactly where Super Metroid fits in my rankings. But without spoiling that episode, it is going to be pretty high. A fantastically atmospheric game before Nintendo get too hooked on the accessibility and the ability for everyone to get through a game which almost runs counter to how alien and strange Super Metroid is.
That's a real kind of tug of war through all the Metroid games. But there's something so refreshing about going back and playing this, you know, completely off-the-leash exploration game with amazing powers, some really great cinematic moments hidden in there as well with some of the boss fights. Super Metroid is a truly excellent game and is still truly excellent.
For sure. So there it is, lads. And now we come back to you, Matthew.
I'm going to steal Super Metroid.
For me, I think of all the things I've gone back and replayed on SNES, it's the one where I was like, this is still really great because I think Nintendo have made the series a little bit too polite with each entry. And this is the only one which really gives you that absolute hit of going into that world and feeling like you're just absolutely all by yourself and really against the odds, all these alien hordes. I think it's the best SNES game for me personally.
So this is the only one I went in where I was like, whatever happens, I really want to get that. So it isn't me being like a shit lord. It's nothing personal.
Please don't retaliate.
To make a typical reference, there is no Space Marine in glasses following you around and telling you where to look in this game.
Hopefully someone will mod that in a SNES rom.
A fan, yeah, like a rom-ac. Yeah, I did expect that the kills and steals will start coming up around after basically the run of like six picks we just had. Basically everything after Echo the Dolphin has been quite desirable.
So no offense, Dave. Okay, Ash, we come back to you.
All right. Why don't we go sports game and I'm going to pick NBA Jam.
Okay.
Yeah.
That sounded so deflated.
Yes. I was torn between this and a Neo Geo game, but this is a game I loved in my youth. I have the Mega Drive version, but let's go with the SNES because circumstances dictate that I have to.
It's just as good. I loved this game so much. I entered an NBA Jam competition at Blockbuster Video and won some X-Men trading cards as a runners up prize.
So there's the 90s for you. Yeah. Just a supremely playable arcade sports game, really fast fluid.
You can score about 50 points in five seconds and feel like you're the king of basketball. Loads of amazing trick shots where... What do you call it?
A shot? What do you do in basketball? Trick.
What is that?
Baskets.
We'll wait out of our debts, lads.
Tricky dogs. But you know, like this is a real...
Listen to the commentary in NBA Jam.
This is a real like showboat in game where you could like spin through the air to dunk a basketball or you could like break the glass on the backboard. Like it was like American style gaming, like big and brash and exciting. You could show off to your mates.
I asked for this for Christmas. I think my dad was delighted. I was taking an interest in sports.
I wasn't, it was just a really great game.
Yeah, fair enough. I mean, I definitely saw this pop up in a bunch of best of lists from the time. And yeah, would have been a good license pick as well, I think.
And yeah, solid, solid thinking. We come back to you, Dave.
I've got some strategies. I was expecting more kills and steals by this point though.
You got some things to lose. That's the thing with you. If you start a war, you've got two really nice potential draft winners that can come off the board.
I'm going to be like Idris Elba in House of Dynamite. You know, I just can't. Can I start a global world war?
Great topical reference.
Great film. I'm going to go.
Have you got another story about braining a man this time with a nuclear weapon perhaps?
We'll see how the night goes. I might have one by the end. I'm going to go.
Real again. No, I can't do it. I don't know what to do at this point.
Shit, it's really tough.
You should have had this internal monologue before your pick, Dave.
I did, and I still didn't come to any rational conclusion. I think I'm going to go and free pick Earthworm Gym 2.
Okay.
I know. I'm still trying to play it.
That's like that much. Wow, real umming and ah-ing for Earthworm Gym 2. Please speak on it.
This game, again, I think this is something where it might be an age thing, but it hit me just right at that time in my life where this sort of level of pure old humor just absolutely appealed to me. You know, it's you've got like a stage where you're catching like puppies falling out from the sky or they splat on the ground. You've got it turns into a salamander in one in one of the stages as well.
You have to sort of navigate. There's everyone remembers the cow, right? We've got to carry the cow around and save it from being abducted by UFO.
It's just it's so balmy and out there. And I really loved the TV show at the time as well. It was just this like vibrant, humorous, like just a bunch of stupid ideas that somehow coalesced into this really enjoyable platformer game.
And yeah, it was personal faith of me growing up. So yeah, that's why I'm taking it.
I don't mean to be a dick, but I always found this game absolutely ghastly.
Well, there we go.
Not a word you hear very often on this.
Ghastly. It's ghastly strong, isn't it?
If you want a depressing deep dive, read about the guy who designed Deathwing Jim. That's what I'm saying. That's a bit of a wiki downer, I would say.
I always found it really hard to read what was interactive and what wasn't on the screen because of the art style.
Any thoughts? Any response from the Scarborough camp on that one?
I don't know. I just sat closer to the TV than you. I can't read.
I will say it had that European platform game design as well, where there's no clear level design. The levels just sprawl in every direction and you get lost.
Yeah, you can easily get lost. There isn't a clear... Sometimes as well, the ledges aren't quite so clearly defined that you can know whether you're reaching them or not from like taking a big leap.
You know, it's like...
Do you want to change your pick?
It wasn't a preciseness to it. No, no, I'm absolutely fine with it. I think it earns its place in that category, certainly over my other pick of Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.
So, we'll... It was on my list, but for some reason, it wasn't appropriate.
A great wild card.
They're making a movie about him.
Okay.
So, let's go. Just try not to do the thing I need to do this early or this early or at this stage. I've got one more go, basically.
We know what it is.
I'm going to go in fighting Street Fighter 2.
Which one?
Oh, does it matter? Do I really have to say?
You need a version. Well, there's lots of Street Fighter 2s, and also you need to say what platform. Have you already taken for SNES games?
Well, it depends what I have Earthworm Jim 2 on, right?
So, let's sort this out.
Well, I can say one's on SNES and one's on Mega Drive. They're both multi-platform.
Yeah, he just about survived that one, Dave.
But come on, which Street Fighter 2?
I don't know. The one that's on the SNES Mini. Is that a tournament?
Street Fighter 2, SNES Mini.
Authoritative retro game chatter on Back Page Podcast.
Yeah, like Turbo. There we go.
Turbo.
Is that fine?
Yeah, you've limited the finish line.
Not Alpha 2.
What do you like best about Street Fighter 2 Turbo?
Fighting people. It's great. You get to punch them.
It has great combos. It just has one of the most iconic rosters of fighters in any game in its genre. It's mechanically precise.
It's rewarding for the more time you invest in it. The stages are just glorious, vibrant, bright.
Goes across various different pretty well captured different locations from around the world in a very distinct cartoonish style. And yeah, just again, I kind of lean towards the games I used to sit in my bedroom playing with mates, and this is just another one of those that's a classic, just one that's never been beaten. I think Street Fighter 2 is a game out of all the Street Fighters I know obviously people, they've become more advanced and complicated and you know, there's how many Street Fighters now are there?
Seven?
Six.
Six. They all have their merits, but you can walk into bars, pubs, cafes across the country and Street Fighter 2 still sat there in a corner in an arcade cabinet and it's still just great fun to get up and play with a stranger and I still do that and I did that very recently on a holiday. I went on down to Cornwall.
It was just there and I just played it with a random guy at like 10 o'clock at night and it was great fun. For its continued charm and playability, it's the best fighting game there is.
Absolutely wins that category. There's no point even fighting it, to be honest. Like it's that and everything else, like just in terms of recognizability to the people voting, I think so.
Better than Eternal Champions.
Oh, sorry. Sorry, Matthew. Yes, of course.
Eternal Champions, obviously a banger. Yeah, very good, Dave. I think that makes sense to pick Earthworm Jim 2.
Not so much, eh?
But I wish you well. Ash, what's your next pick?
I think I agree with your assessment of Street Fighter 2, therefore I will steal it right now. Quite happy to take the SNES version, so I don't have to play on a three-button Mega Drive pad. I think we've said all there is to say about Street Fighter 2 and why it's great, so I'll tell you a couple of stories.
One is that I first played this game when a babysitter brought his import Super Nintendo around, and he had Street Fighter 2 and Smash TV. That genuinely is a life-changing moment. I was a lad with a Commodore 64 and to see Street Fighter 2 on the SNES out of nowhere, I don't think I even knew what a SNES was.
Oh my god, a dream.
Can you imagine? That is the moment I became the person I am today. For better or worse.
It's that terrifying moment where your parents come home to send the babysitter home and their son's saying, I've been changed. I've been changed while you were away.
And then more recently, like the way Street Fighter keeps touching my life. Recently we went to a vinyl record stall and my partner came back with the soundtrack to Top Gun on vinyl and she was playing that and hearing this soundtrack for the first time and Ken's theme is totally 100% ripped off from one of the songs in Top Gun, which I'm sure is common knowledge to Street Fighter fans. I had no idea.
So Dave, you mentioned loads of things that are great about Street Fighter 2, but I'll throw in the music as well. Absolutely amazing music, some of it's stolen across every single stage of the game, Street Fighter 2.
I think you're going to lose Sonic 2, unfortunately, Mash, that's the price you're going to pay for that choice. Yeah, maybe. We'll see how that goes, I guess.
OK, Matthew, we come back to you.
Side scroll and beat him up or shooter. I'll take, well, I'll attempt to take Streets of Rage 2.
Nice.
Yeah, which I think is held as the best Streets of Rage game.
On the Mega Drive.
Certainly the one that I've played the most. The simple pleasure of playing two player, beat him up. I always enjoy anyway, because I think they're so pick up and play.
Like that's a it's a great genre for for dragging someone into the fact that you have these very distinct characters, they got real personality to them. This one adds. Was it just the lad with skates?
This one added or was there another person?
Just skate. It took away Adam and replaced him with skate, which I always thought was absolutely brutal.
The idea of getting kicked with sort of inline skate seems like. The worst thing to be kicked with.
But again, very 90s, right?
Yeah, but it looks amazing. The soundtrack. Is it Yuzo Koshiro?
Is that right?
Yeah.
One of the iconic Mega Drive soundtracks. I don't really have any hugely deep philosophies on the art of the beat-em-up, other than I just find their real sort of... It's a real fast-food genre, and this is, you know, the king of the cheeseburgers.
Fucking hell.
Beautifully said. Very good, Matthew. Yeah, no notes there.
Yeah, I think this is a pretty wide-open genre, actually. A wide-open category. I certainly saw similar sentiment for this.
I probably played it and just don't remember it, to be honest. But yeah, I think that makes sense. It comes back to me then, I guess, for two picks.
So let's just steal Super Mario World. Little one-to-one swap there. That's mine.
No one's going to kill that now. I think that Matthew did that to himself, which is how these things work in the draft.
And I'm the only one with a steal left.
Yes! That said that we've all got kills left, Dave, remember? So that's going to be sat at the top of my draft picks now, which is good.
I do think Sonic 2 is better, but it's obviously an excellent platformer from the time, considered one of the best Nintendo games ever. Yadda, yadda, yadda, that's mine. Thank you very much.
Then I guess next up, let's do a bit of tactical picking here. And for free pick, I'm going to take Final Fantasy VI. So, two fucking excellent square RPGs of the time.
This considered one of the all-time great entries in terms of the elevation of story and characters. Very, very nice looking game. It's across the generation, the sort of gulf between Final Fantasy IV, which is a nice looking game, and this, which is an amazing looking game.
They just really push the art to its limits and the music to its limits. And a story with many kind of like dramatic ups and downs, loads of different perspectives on that story with one of the largest parties they ever did in a Final Fantasy game, and has that opera bit that everyone likes. You can now blast through this game in about fucking 15 hours using the Pixel Remaster, because you can just jam on, basically like increase the amount of XP you get, so you don't have to do the grinding as much.
And it's still a great, great time, still beloved all these years later, and I think like it's a testament to its staying power that people still love this game even after FF7 came out and like culturally blotted out all of the Final Fantasy games that came before it, particularly in Europe where we never even heard of these games. But I think as time's gone on, it's really kind of like maintained its reputation amid that. So yeah, Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6, I do like having those together as a pair.
But there are many other good RPGs available. So hey ho.
And a link to the past.
We move back to you, Matthew.
I will take in RPG, I'll take Earthbound.
Oh yeah.
Yeah. Honest says, I mean, always seemed incredibly exotic to us in the UK, because it didn't come out in the UK. For many of us, seeing the world of Earthbound and Mother in Smash Brothers and thinking, oh, one day I'd like quite like to play that.
I think that slightly sort of exotic nature maybe makes it seem a bit more exciting than it actually is. But I still think this is an RPG worth playing. It's kind of like off-kilter and quite meta which, given that this is quite early on in that genre existing, is interesting in itself.
Set in this strange Americana world, fighting enemies which are all kinds of weird random objects. It's quite sort of surreal and silly sense of humour, but also quite soulful. Itoi, who created this series, isn't like your traditional game-maker.
He's like a writer and a deep thinker and a bit of a philosopher. And I think, brought that off-kilter vision to the game, you know. It's quite a sort of sincere game about love and the power of friendship.
You know, trying to do a little bit more within the, quite a conventional-looking, you know, the shape of it is quite conventional in its turn-based battles and all that. But yeah, thematically and visually and quite an unusual and still quite a distinct game to play now.
Yeah, I mean, there's really nothing else like this on, you know, that you can pick in this draft for the reasons that you say there, like in terms of storytelling. It's a weird take on Americana. I didn't realize until doing the research today that this game had an all-time stinky US marketing campaign that really just, when you looked at the print ads for it, you were like, what the hell were they thinking?
And they're very distinct, right? And indeed, the game did not sell well in North America. But it is like a bit of a, it's a really cool thing to discover even now, if you've got like the SNES, like the, sorry, the Switch Online service and all that stuff.
So I reviewed this at Games TM, yeah, about just over a decade ago now. And yeah, it's really cool. It does some cool things with the RPG genre, as well in terms of like when you encounter enemies who are low level, it like auto resolves the battles, for example.
Some of the art is very cursed, the little sprite art, some all-time insane looking women in this, proper second reference of the evening, but Junji Ito shit to some of the characters in this, I would say. But yes, good pick Matthew. We come back to Ashley Day.
Okay, a free pick I'm going to take on the Super Nintendo Harvest Moon.
Oh, a really good pick.
Yeah, thank you. I played this in the late 90s on an emulator. Harvest Moon didn't come out here in the UK, and I played it having burnt my way through loads of the RPGs that we'd missed out on at the time, the Final Fantasies, Earth Bounds, Secret of Mana 2.
Harvest Moon on the surface looked like the RPG. It had the feel of an RPG, but it was a totally different thing. We all know it so well now, and it inspired quite a lot of modern indie games as well.
Back then, it was totally original, this farming simulation, but not a simulation in the boring, dry sense. Yes, it simulated farming of crops and harvesting, but it equally simulated the idea of living a tranquil, relaxing life out in the country side. You can get all your chores done in the first quarter of the day, and then you just mill around town and soak up the sunshine and the friendliness of it all.
Maybe talk to a girl, fall in love and marry her, go to the shop and buy a cow. Things we all like to do. I found it really refreshing at the time.
There had really been nothing else like it. And again, I think similar to Echo the Dolphin, like a great non-violent game that was still very, very engaging and very fulfilling to play. Look how it's lasted all these years.
Countless sequels and inspirations later. But it was a true original at the time.
Yeah, that's a great pick because I didn't even think about it, but you kind of sort of like done a bit of tactical picking genre-wise there because you can't really pick anything that matches it. It's really just a one-off. So yes, good stuff.
Okay, then we come back to the mighty Dave Scarborough for two picks.
I've got Amiga, Fighting and Platformer because I've got my fighting game stolen. So I will go for fighting game Mortal Kombat 2 on the SNES. I kind of assumed the Street Fighter was going to get stolen.
Mortal Kombat, as everyone can remember, was sort of this very taboo game if you were a young lad as I was when it came out. So it was very much something that I wasn't allowed in my household. So I had to go to someone else's house to play.
And I think Mortal Kombat 2 sort of established its legacy in the sense of it introduced a lot of the sort of core tenets of like the Mortal Kombat, like lore, the sort of canon of it here. So this was, you know, the first one where you had like the babalities, where you turn people into babies at the end. You had the Toasty guy, just trying to be, I always think, sometimes I think he says, whoopsie is Toasty, right?
So he goes, Toasty comes up, you have the friendships, this, they changed the scoring system on this one as well. So it was about the most eliminations. And then you got like a bunch of the, of sort of the more iconic characters showed up in this one.
So Kung Lao, you had Katana, Jax, Baraka. This was a game that for all its sort of brutality and gore and all of the controversial stuff that is really known, like it's stuff that sort of made the headlines back then. It was as well just a very slick and playable fighting game that for me, maybe not as good as Street Fighter, but the second best in the genre for me of this of this period for sure.
Like in terms of its mechanics and depth to it, it had a lot of substance and had a lot of blood. Yeah, good fun.
I think people mostly just, it's like a perfect game to discover when you were probably the age that you played it.
Yeah, exactly.
Just it's like quite juvenile, but in a way that, I mean, the more combat games are all like this, but in a kind of gratifying, fun, silly way.
But also say it had that sort of depth that was sort of rewarded by various stupid funny things, right? Like turning people into babies, I would say. Discovering how to make those happen, like learning all those different combos to unlock those was very gratifying, to your point.
Well, then we come back to your for you again, Dave, for another thing.
Yeah, I'm going to have to steal because it's that time. And I'm going to steal Sonic 2 in the platform.
There it is.
Because it is the best platformer. Everyone else has chosen. Actually, has everyone chosen?
No, because Matthew's got to repick his, but he can't steal Sonic 2 because I stole it. This is the greatest platformer of the generation. The kinetic energy of it.
I think you made a good point as well, Sam, about the depth to the level design, like finding those portals into the bonus stages, those little extra lives, those little hidden cut-throughs to the end of the levels. The addition of Tails. I used to have, there was this young girl, Natasha, who used to come around my house, who was the daughter of family friends, and used to give her the controller and say that she could play as Tails.
Bashed her head in, she was in hospital.
No, it was more of a mental injury where I just pretended that she had any bearing on Tails' controls and was having any input into what I was doing at any point. But no, she was just occasionally.
Early example of Dave gaslighting a woman, not the last time.
Exactly. But I just didn't like to share and let her play Sonic. So anyway, great game, 10 out of 10, can't really beat it and therefore it's a real winner.
So thanks Ash, appreciate it.
I think it's a fair swap Street Fighter 2 and Sonic 2. That's like cosmically balanced, like Metroid and Mario World. I think those are quite good little dyads of draft picking.
Ash, we come back to you for a kill hopefully.
Because I'm in a killing mood after that bullshit. So, I am going to kill the first game that was picked, Link to the Past.
Off the board, fuck!
I love Link to the Past, but goodbye. Needs to go after that brutal display from you, Dave. And I need to replace Sonic 2, so I am going to replace it with Sonic CD, on the Mega CD.
Oh, there it is.
Which is my other favorite Sonic game. I think this is... Actually, now that I think about it, this is the best Sonic game.
It's not, but it's like the coolest.
I think if you could convince anyone of that, Ash, it's yourself.
Yeah, Sonic CD. This is, I believe, the game that Sega Japan were making while Sonic 2 was being made in the States. So, it's the real deal made by the real Sega, not Sega Technical Institute.
Yeah, a time travel Sonic game where you can, each level has three different versions, a past, future and present version. If you go really fast, like a DeLorean, you can zoom through time into a completely different version of the stage. So, real heads had to finish each level multiple times to see all of the game.
And, much like Sonic 2, had these amazing bonus levels as well, utilizing the sprite scaling effects that the Mega CD brought to the Mega Drive. So, you got these like Mario Kart style, almost like 3D levels that you could run around in on the bonus stages. Just, yeah, a really fun game, and this is the Sonic game you can go back to decades later, and still find a lot of hidden depth too.
So, it's the connoisseur's choice, I'm going to say.
Yes. I fucking love the music in this game. Yes.
It was a really cool thing to just play through for the first time and be like, this game is quite mind-bending for an entry in the most popular series on this platform. Yeah, it's a really special thing. I'm glad it's widely available now.
That's a solid backup pick, I think, with Sonic 2 gone. That's a real head's note pick, I think. So, it comes back to you, Matthew.
For sports or racing, which was just another category I struggled with a little bit, I'm going to go with Super Punch Out.
Oh, good pick.
It's a bit different. Punch Out is sort of the arcade boxing game, but more of a puzzle game where you have to work out how to bring down these opponents by spotting little tells and almost working out little shortcuts that if you deliver a particular jab to a particular part of the body, you know, when they're pulling off a particular animation, you can absolutely sort of destroy them, you know, very, very quickly. So it's really a sort of series of boss fights where you're trying to kind of unpick how they work.
I don't think mechanically it's like a particularly big step up from the first. Like I think a lot of what makes Punch Out great is there in the NES original, but here you just have these like amazing sprites. I mean, the screenshots just look absolutely incredible and they're so full of character and these sort of mad caricatures.
And it's visually very, very striking and it's a little bit of fun. I think it's a, you know, a quote unquote sports game that I think anyone can pick up and give a go to. You might not be playing it for hundreds of hours, but it's a sports game that comes to my mind anyway.
I see the logic there. That makes sense. Okay.
Yeah, it was cool to play. I guess I was just playing NES Punch Out when we did the episode, Matthew. It's just a great little formula for a game, isn't it?
So these are my final two picks, unless someone kills one of my picks. So I guess that's a little bit of mutually assured destruction going on.
You should kill now, right?
Well, maybe I will, maybe I won't.
Are you just going to sit on your nukes again?
Yeah.
This is like House of Dynamite.
Yeah, but I'm just protecting the goods. That's all it is. Because honestly, one person kills one of my games, I'll just use the kill straight on them.
So it's like, what else? I feel like it's not in the spirit.
I think you've got to use it against someone who isn't me.
You should use it. All right. Maybe I'll use it.
It was maybe a bit cowardly not to use it last time, and could probably have taken this thing out of Matthew's picks a little bit if I had done that. But I think the board has been balanced a little bit by Zelda being taken off. I feel like Ash did everyone a favor with that pick.
And so, I don't know.
Take care of Jim, I'll repick it. It was so disliked, I'm regretting it.
If you need Super Mario Kart, that would really wipe out a lot of Dave's strength.
Don't help him, he's the enemy.
Well, the man who took Super Metroid from me, that's a good catch.
Yeah, and you took Super Mario World from me. So we're fair, we're friends again.
Fuck him up.
We have sort of like CivStyle negotiated piece. That's true.
Yeah, and I feel like we should protect that piece at all costs and you should hurt Dave.
Your catapults have been withdrawn.
Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage.
Well, I don't know, I think, I don't think I feel like Matthew's picks are that strong overall.
Yeah, exactly.
They're quite a weak pick.
This is what you go wrong with this every time.
And therefore, like killing EarthBound almost feels like overkill, you know, it's sort of like, yeah, just get off your foot. I don't know. It's sort of.
And then Asher's picks are sort of idiosyncratic in the Asher. And then, Dave, your picks are strong, but then you have lost Zelda, so it's sort of like. Yeah, don't hurt me more.
Kill Shining Force.
Well, I think it's worth holding on to that killer, seeing what happens because the game's going to continue.
No, come on, you can't.
I feel like someone's going to kill one of my games anyway. So I think it's sensible to hold on to it. That's just good strategizing.
And, you know, let's see how it goes.
There's only two of us who could kill one of your games. I'm least likely because Ash is a dick.
Have you all got a pick left to make after this?
I've got two picks.
Matthew, you've got one pick, right?
Yes.
Platformer, right?
Yeah, that's right.
It's really only you, Matthew.
And Ash, you've got one pick?
I've got one pick, yeah.
Well, then I'll just hold on to that and see what happens.
You're doing the people a disservice. They'll vote against you for this.
I don't think so.
They should.
I don't think so, because if I use it and then you go to town, it's like I've made a tactical error there.
That's the fun of it. I hope they hold this against you.
Well, fair enough. I guess we'll see what happens, won't we? So two picks here.
Can't win against Street Fighter 2. No point in even trying really. So I am going to take Garou, Mark of the Wolves.
If you want to buy this on Neo Geo, it will cost you 3 grand according to eBay, Ash. That was quite a revelation. I will say, just look at this game in action and your mind will be absolutely blown.
The animations in this unbelievably beautiful-looking fighting game. I played about 45 minutes of this today. Like all fighting games, I'm just really out of my depth with this kind of thing.
But really, the artistry of it is absolutely amazing. And I think that's pretty much true for everything SNK was doing at this time. You can kind of admire it even if you don't fully understand it.
Certainly how I felt. But honestly, man, those animations alone kind of worth the pick just for that. And it does have a reputation among fighting fans as being an all-time classic.
Ash, I'm guessing you're a little bit familiar with this.
This was on my list. It's amazing. It's the pinnacle of the Fatal Fury series.
It's kind of SNK's answer to Street Fighter 3 in terms of having just gorgeous, big, bold, beautifully animated sprites and amazing backgrounds. They went about 17 years after this before making another Fatal Fury again, because how do you top it? They topped it by putting Cristiano Ronaldo in the game.
Yes, kind of weird. But let's not hold that against Mark of the Wolves. It is a very, very special game.
It's really good.
Yeah, it's just unbelievably good. Another one, you can just go play very easily by typing in, Play Garou Mark of the Wolves, and then some website will have a version you can play. Is it legal?
It's not my place to say, really.
You don't have to spend three grand on the Neo Geo version. You can get it on your Switch for like six pounds, and that's a bargain. You'd be so happy you paid six quid for it.
Absolutely. I've got a bunch of these Neo Geo games on the old PSPricers discount list now, so I'll hoover them up when they, inevitably, a quid comes off of them, each of them, or wherever. Okay, my last pick, at least at the time being, it's category five, side scrolling, beat them up or shooter.
Got to take Gunstar Heroes. I've been there the whole time. Actually wasn't my number one pick, but now I get to the end, and I think, what might move the needle with the listeners in this category?
I think this might do. A treasure game, the first treasure game? I think that's right.
Got bored of making games for Konami, these lads, so they just thought, we'll go off and make our own original thing, and that's what they did. They made one of the all-time great Mega Drive games, a shooter where you select your style of shooting and the type of projectile you fire, then it changes a lot as you're playing. Absolutely gorgeous pixel art from the time and effects, and just still really very playable now.
I played it on Xbox Series X earlier today, and it's just so responsive, so fun. The different types of fire are so exciting. When you set people on fire, it's just a really nice flame attacking this.
It just great visual effects. I can see why at the time it became a standout, and over time, its reputation has just grown as one of the key Mega Drive titles. So feels like the right pick.
Matthew, we talked about this before, right? Have you got a relationship with this game?
Yeah, this is absolutely fantastic. Brilliant music. I've played the Game Boy Advance version of it, probably a little more than the original these days.
Superheroes.
Yeah. Beautiful boss fights, really high concept stuff. I mean, Treasure were just doing things no one else was doing.
It's felt like they understood the tech of the Mega Drive, and could perform some dark arts with it. There's this amazing morphing boss fight called Seven Force, I think, which morphs into all these different forms as you fight it. And I mean, it's just amazing.
Some of the best boss design of all time.
Yeah. Well, there it is. My final pick.
And now it comes back to, who does it come back to? Ash. No, Matthew.
Come back to Matthew.
My last pick. If I don't use my kill and upset everything. But I do like the drama of it, you know?
I feel like there should be...
Season finale energy.
Lots of nervous eyes shifting around the room.
I just, the thing is, I know what I think is the strongest collection of games here, but I don't want to get it back in turn.
I don't think it's that clear who's got the best. I think having Sonic 2 and Super Mario Kart feels like the... Don't push it my way!
Before this, Sam, you've got to step up your game, Dave. You did shit with your Ghostbusters and Lost Fire. You've got to really play to win.
I play to win and then I get fucking bullied for it and targeted with...
This is not bullying. I'm just saying, you have done a great job. If you had got Zelda away, if you had got off scot-free with that, it would have been lights out.
The thing is, I don't think I can kill one of Sam's picks without him just killing one of my picks in return. Whether or not that's the best move to make, I think it will awaken my...
Kill one of Ash's then, just for loads. Take Shining Force, it's precious to him.
There are two other Shining Force games I can replace.
I think he's going to use it. I think Matthew's got a bit more chaotic energy than he normally does. I can feel it in the water.
He's got his hand on the nuclear football.
I do think Sam has got a real winning draft.
What, is everyone trying to get me to attack Sam? Knowing that he's just going to fucking kill... I don't know what, but...
Earthbound. I would say Earthbound would be quite fatal if you lost that, Matthew.
Could you really allow him to have Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger?
That is the combo, right? That's what's causing me some upset. I still want to sit on my nuke.
You two.
Come on.
I could tell you're disappointed, Dave.
I'm disappointed I'm always the target, because none of you got the stones to do it.
Well, Dave, you've got your own... Why haven't you used your nuke?
I know I haven't, because tactically I know what I want to use it on. And Matthew, it's not you, so just go for someone else.
God, this is how it just overfell.
I remember Ash, Ash has used all his, so actually you've used your kill. Yeah, he used his kill on me. Duh.
I can always get my revenge in future drafts, Dave.
Ashley Day will return in the levels draft coming February 2026.
I'm going to trust the process and I'm not going to use my kill. But if anyone kills one of mine, I am coming after you.
So, none of you have used it, so it's only me left, because if I don't kill everyone of your games, it's game over.
But you will, Dave. That's the thing about you. You will.
You're destined to do it, just like you're brain-packing on the playground. Violence is in your blood.
Fuck's sake.
Fuck it. It's too strong a pick. I'm killing Chrono Trigger.
Which RPG will you be picking next time, Matthew? Because you better start deciding now.
It's a compliment kill. It's too good a pick. I'm going to take...
I mean, it's not necessarily what I wanted to pick, but in platformer, I'm going to take Kirby Super Star, which is the semi-compilation thing I was referencing earlier, but it's, you know, in that it is a collection of seven modes, but it is all made for SNES. None of it is a compilation of old Kirby games. This is just Sakurai going mad, starting...
basically the form that all his games will take from this point on, which is just everything but the kitchen sink, complete sort of scattered shot of everything. You know, there's Kirby platformers in there. There's a weird sort of Metroidvania cave exploration game.
There's a racing game against King Dedede. Yeah, it's just him throwing every Kirby idea he possibly has. There's co-op play in there as well, so you can enjoy all this hectic stuff with a friend.
I know that Kirby isn't for everyone. You know, hopefully over the many episodes of this podcast, we've managed to convert more people to the Kirby cause, in which case, it's not Sonic and it's not Mario, but it's the next best thing I got.
Okay, fair enough, Matthew. I think it's a good compromise, given the situation you're in. I'm bereft of one of the all-time classics of the time in that category.
All right, so who is next then? Is it Ash again?
It's me. Yes, the only one I have left is Sidescroller or Shooter. It's time to pick a Neo Geo game, I think.
And it won't surprise anyone. It's Metal Slug.
Oh, so good. I was so close to picking one of these over Gunstar Heroes. These, the animation upgrade.
Oh my god, it's so good-looking, these games.
Yeah, it's amazing. And like, I shouldn't say this because I want to win, but I think if you had Metal Slug, Gunstar Heroes and Contra 3, you've got like almost like the holy trinity of run and gun games there. So, you know, they're all great picks.
But yeah, Metal Slug is, it's just like an epic game for me, one of my all time favorites.
Wait, haven't you picked?
Beautiful gameplay. Nope.
You picked Side Scroller, didn't you? Oh no, no, sorry.
Ignore me. No, I didn't get fucked. Metal Slug, it is.
Yeah, like amazing, tight gameplay. We did talk about it a little bit before when we were talking about Neo Turf Masters, strangely. Incredible pixel art.
Good luck getting your Mega Drive or your SNES to do this, or indeed your Amiga. You could jump in a tank and then the tank not only is really durable and could fire these giant bullets, but your tank could jump and duck. That's really squishy, cartoony, malleable tank.
Who could have thought of that? I don't know. Only the most imaginative game designers who, they want to bend reality to their will to make a supremely playable game and that they did.
Lots of sequels followed and are all really, really good, but Metal Slug still has a place in my heart. Fell in love with it instantly in the arcades. I do not own the Neo Geo AES version.
I own a lovingly reproduced version of it by a nice man in France, which cost a lot less than the, I think, 10 grand it would cost you to buy today or something insane like that. But I just had to have it. I had to have a big chunky cartridge that I could plug into my Neo Geo because this game is totemic to me.
I love the modern age of games because I got all of these in a Steam collection for about five quid, like two years ago. And just fired up Metal Slug today. You can change the difficulty.
You can make it a lot easier if you want to. But my God, the animations in this and the visuals, just fucking unbelievable. And all-time great set dudes on Firegame, just genuinely like harrowing.
Yeah, really, really is.
And no one is making games like this anymore. So even if they tried, I don't think they could top it, but it just hasn't aged a day.
I think out of everything picked, this is the closest to a game that if it released now, as a new indie game, people wouldn't blink twice.
I think it would be bigger now than it ever was if it came out fresh.
Yeah, it really just does hold up on that level. So, yep, good stuff, Ash. Then we come back to you, Dave, for how many picks you got?
I've got two left.
I've got two left.
I've got to repick RPG and I've got Amiga. I'll go and I've got a kill. I'm going to pick in RPG, Super Mario RPG.
I'm going to continue my trend of picking things off the SNES Mini because unsurprisingly, not having a SNES growing up, a lot of my tastes of the SNES are informed by both the SNES Mini and Virtual Console, Super Mario RPG, fantastic, unique take of the RPG genre with like an all-star cast of Nintendo characters. I didn't play this till much later in life, but you can see why it had such an impact on people who did play it in their youth, taking all those characters and throwing them into sort of a turn-based. Well, I mean, if you've played Paper Mario, you kind of get that experience a little bit, but there's something about the art style and like the setting that makes it feel a little bit more of that sort of 90s Mario era that just gives it like a different level of charm to the Paper Mario series.
So, yeah, really great game, adding that to my list. Then I am going to kill Ash. But more specifically, I'm going to kill Monkey Island 2 from Amiga.
Oh, fuck it all.
Instead, I'm going to take Monkey Island on Amiga, which is the second best point and click there. A game that I love. Ash knows I love because I was continually commentating as I was playing through it a couple of years back.
Just the introduction to this fantastic series of iconic point and click games, the charming throwback setting, the humor, the various encounters you have just circling around the island, investigating all different things, backtracking. I don't know. It's just such a charming captivating experience.
It's generally my favorite point and click I've ever played. It's phenomenal. Only bettered by its sequel, but unfortunately that is off the board so no one can pick it.
So really, the only choice is Monkey Island.
Whoever did that was clearly a bad person. Yes. Okay.
All right. Well, that's me done. Brutal for Ash.
It's back to Ash Scott picking Amiga game before he was out, but they...
That's absolutely... I cannot tell you how much that has wounded me. It's one of the most hurtful things anyone has ever done.
Like a Telltale character, I will remember this.
Okay. Then Ash, it's your pick again and then it's my pick after. Right.
Okay. So this is a bit of a dilemma because I didn't have any other options for Amiga, even though, as you all know, it's one of my favorite systems. I just, it never occurred to me.
Worms.
Well, it's funny you should say that because that's what I'm going to do. And it kind of breaks a rule for me because I try not to like overly promote Team17 games as I do work there. But Worms the Director's Cut is one of my favorite games of all time.
It's the 30th anniversary of Worms right now. So it feels like literally this month, it feels right. What can I say about Worms without sounding like I am over promoting a game that I work on.
A fantastically fun and funny and tactical multiplayer game. You can play forever. Every level is different.
The outcomes, the permutations are so varied that no one game is ever the same. It's best on the Amiga. There is a SNES and a Mega Drive version, but this game was lovingly made for the Amiga.
It works really well with a mouse and keyboard. The Director's Cut version is the definitive version, as you might expect. This is where the concrete donkey was added.
It's not in the original game, for example. You could make your own levels with deluxe paint on the Director's Cut version. It had interiors, so you could use deluxe paint to make interiors of houses and things where the face of the house got blown off.
There was an inside that you could then explore and climb around in. Amazing! 15-year-old me sat over his Amiga 1200, spent hours and hours playing this game and making content for it.
It was my first experience of UGC. It had such a profound effect on me. It later shaped my career in a very meaningful way.
Top that.
Indeed. I think that's a great pick. And it was my second pick for Amiga, if I didn't get June.
Oh, lovely.
So, yeah, it was cool. Interesting reading about how late it was in the Amiga's lifespan and how it didn't sell very well as a result, but did have the first game with the Holy Hand Grenade, I believe. So that's what I learned in my research.
OK, so Matthew, you definitely picked all your games, right?
Yes.
OK, so it comes back to me. Let's kill EarthBound. Much like Dave on the playground, that's me tomb stoning this onto the concrete.
So, I mean, you know, it wouldn't have happened if Matthew hadn't killed Chrono Trigger, but here we are.
But we all used our kills, though. So well done, everyone.
Like, that's...
I think it sort of made sense. I think it was always going to be me and Matthew just sort of pointing a gun at each other's heads. And I did also kind of take two RPGs expecting one of them to die.
And so just getting Final Fantasy 6 out of that bargain is pretty good, to be honest. Can't really complain there. If you had killed Final Fantasy 6, actually, I was going to take Mega Bomberman, a game I love.
That's what made me think we should have had a multiplayer category.
I don't know why I didn't take that instead of Earthworm Jim 2 because that was on my list. I had a moment of madness.
Well, there are many things you do, Dave, that we never understand on this podcast, but that's okay. That's why we love having you back. You confound us and have great anecdotes about brutalizing children.
I was a child at the time. I was an adult brutalizing a child. I just want to make that clear to everyone.
No, I know.
Okay. So I have to pick RPG because my RPG was killed. I will take Secret of Mana.
Oh, what a terrible runner's up prize that is. Yes, a game I have not played and didn't think I would have to talk about on this podcast, but considered one of the greatest RPGs of all time. Absolutely beautiful looking game.
I believe it's part of what's known as the Final Fantasy Adventure, a subset of Square RPGs, a series where they never really match the magic of it again. Honestly, I don't know why I have not played it. I've played Final Fantasy 6, I've played Chrono Trigger, it has the Mode 7, like going across the world map thing that both those games have.
It looks like a great game and Ash, I know you're a fan. Here it is, my RPG. But it is definitely considered one of the best on the system, and there are just no shortage of RPGs on the SNES.
So yes, stakes are low, but again, compliments.
Who's your favorite character?
That would have to be, let's see, Fana. It would have to be Fana, Dave. Big Fana guy.
I knew it. Oh my gosh. Yes.
Fana's my girl. Hey ho, that's all right. That's how these things go.
That's still a pretty strong pick if you ask me. Ash, maybe you have some more detailed reflections on this than I do.
Yeah. This is one of my favorite games of all time. Looks beautiful.
I think it has probably the best music there's ever been in a game. It's kind of like if Zelda actually was an RPG. It doesn't have the dungeons and the puzzles really in the same way, but it's got action combat in 2D, but with leveling up and spells and all of that stuff to do.
Quite unique at the time because it was a co-op game. You could put up to three people who could adventure together through this very, very long and expansive RPG. I did that back in the day.
I played two-player with my mate. It's also one of the few SNES RPGs that actually came out in Europe. I think it overindexes in this country.
There's a lot of fondness because it was one of the few games of its type available here. I think it's a good pick.
Well, thank you. It's a weird bind to be in, but I do know it's considered one of the big RPGs of the system. So all good, really.
Matthew, we come back to you for your RPG pick.
Well, I get the opportunity to celebrate.
It's got to be Dark Souls Free Energy, this pick.
Listen, I'm taking Final Fantasy IV, aka Final Fantasy II as it was released in the States. I actually haven't played this, so I can't give it a full-bodied endorsement other than it too appears on many lists of best RPGs. I'll say below the other picks.
I'll be upfront about this. I have somewhat shot myself in the foot by killing Chrono Trigger and say, you know, murder, suicide, Chrono Trigger and Earthbound, which is depressing. But the problem with Final Fantasy 4, as I see it and my understanding of it, is that it is introducing and beginning to master a bit more narrative sophistication, which obviously is then greatly improved as the series goes on, which is why everyone loves Final Fantasy 6 in particular.
In my head, it's a sort of rough first draft, but better than the quite bare bones, you know, very early Final Fantasies. So take pity on poor Castle, take pity on me and vote for Final Fantasy 4.
And remember that he did this to himself, that his list is a little bit less special without Earthbound, because he did this to himself.
I'd just like to point out...
Think of poor Castle wielding the magnum in the doorway and shooting down Chrono Trigger, beloved Chrono Trigger.
And I just want to say, I was panic urging people to kill others to protect myself. I was in a very vulnerable stage 20 minutes ago, and I just want everyone to know that it was an act of preemptive self-defense.
I came this close to messaging Dave on Discord in private, telling him to kill Chrono Trigger. Then I thought, you know what, if those shenanigans got exposed, it might literally be the end of my friendship with Sam.
It's your Epstein files.
I did think actually that that would be what happened. I was kind of relieved when Dave did kill one of Ash's games, because it seemed like you all decided at the very end there that I had the winning hand. And I don't think I actually necessarily agree.
I think Dave might win this recognition of games.
Well, that's not...
No one can kill your games now, Dave, it's done. So it is what it is. We all use kill and steal, and that's good.
I think, though, can I just at the end of the pod here, just throw a suggestion for next time we do one of these, if we do one. Maybe there should be a rule that we have to use one or the other by like the fifth pick or something, you know, just so just...
I think it's becoming too orchestrated at that point. Someone always uses it eventually and it kicks off, you know.
You two nearly didn't. That was the thing.
Maybe it's the rule that you have to use it. It works really well the way it is because we always start out kind of over discussing the first, you know, the picks in the first half and then we're like, oh, we've got to speed up and discuss the games a little bit less in the second half. But then that's when the kills and steals come in.
So they give like a sense of momentum and a new energy to the second half of the pod. True.
They do.
It picks it up.
That's why they're introduced, because the drafts always just sort of taper off when you get to the less exciting picks towards the end.
But then I think the rules, you have to use them then, which we all do.
That might be a good rule, actually. That might be a good rule. But then I do also like it being used as me and Matthew used it.
Matthew, I was wondering, do you regret using your kill token?
Yes, if only because I do have a genuine fondness for Earthbound and I don't like putting stuff in my list that I have very little experience of. It's a bit annoying.
I feel that way too.
But hey, them's the rules, that's fine.
Them's the berries.
We live in a house of dynamite. This is going to happen.
All right, to wrap up then, let's do the different categories and what we each picked. So we'll go Dave, Ash, Matthew, then me at the end as we read these out. So category one, platformer.

Is it? Which one's the first one? The Tales of Monkey Island?
You dickhead.
I want an end.
Don't vote Dave.
The Secret of Monkey Island.
The Secret of Monkey Island. You absolutely knob.
It's half eleven at night.
I'm tired.
You really earned your 80 quid this time, lads.
After Dave killed Monkey Island 2, I took Worms the Director's Cup.
Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.
June 2, Battle for Arrakis. Okay, that's it. You can vote in the Discord, in the announcements channel of the Discord app, which you can find at BackpagePod on Twitter.
It's in the bio. Click there, join, vote, and there'll be a week-long voting window, I think. I consider making it two weeks, but it's just too torturous.
It goes on for too long. So one week is fine. I will also post the winners.
I'll post who stole and killed what as well, because I realized that we didn't recount all of those. We're going through it there, and that'll be useful for you to have. That will all be in the Patreon post at patreon.com/backpagepod.
You can find it there freely. You don't have to sign up to read that. And yes, gentlemen, where can people get you on social media, Ash, starting with you?
All right. I am on Letterboxd as Jelly Scare. You'll see that I watched Kiki's Delivery Service twice yesterday for some reason.
And I am on Blue Sky as Games Black Hole.
And, Dave, where can people find you?
Yeah, you can find me on Blue Sky at scarbs.beesky. And then I am on Letterboxd as D Scarborough, I think. So, yeah, well, Dave Scarborough, something like that.
Great.
But I've said it before, but you can find me there.
Well, as mentioned, this podcast is supported by Patreon. And we did double our rates from the last time we done this. So we'll pay each of Ash and Dave 80 pounds for their time here as a reflection of how much we appreciate what they bring to the podcast.
Nearly enough to buy Mark of the Wolves on Neo Geo.
Just to show them their time, it's not meaningless. But yes, we reinvest the money back into the podcast. It's all about putting in the effort and making sure it's good.
So thank you, gentlemen, for your time. I appreciate it. Matthew, if you'll get you on social media.
I am at Mr. Basil Pesto on Blue Sky and the other one Letterboxd.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on those things as well. Thank you for listening.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
