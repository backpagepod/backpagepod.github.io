Hello and welcome to the Backpage XL, a Patriot exclusive episode of the Backpage Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Hello Matthew. I saw you drink beer this past week for the first time ever. And to be honest. Yeah, I think so. I don't think I've ever seen you have a beer at any other point. Did you have any beer on your stag day? You certainly went drunk on your stag day. Oh, I had a c I had a couple of beers. Yeah? Okay. Well but you had like four beers in about Two hours, which you know that's prolific, I would say. And um, you know, it was just interesting because I'd definitely not seen you drunk before, and I would c or like tipsy, whatever you want to describe the situation you're in. And uh I'll be honest, you were the same, um, to be honest. It was the same Matthew Castle I think. Um just with slight uh ten percent sillier facial expressions. Um how would you describe the experience of drinking that much beer? Well you don't normally drink beer that much.

Matthew
01:17
It was fine. Yeah, uh I I have any any brilliant observations on it. I I went to see quite an intense play the next day. I went to see all my sons with Brian Cranston. and you know, there were a lot of people having very emotionally raw arguments and yelling at one another and I was I wasn't like, oh my you know, keep it down or anything like that, but you know, you do feel You know, maybe like twenty percent more fragile than you usually do. Yeah, yeah. And that wasn't that was enough to just sort of Yeah. You know, just to feel a little out of sorts.

Samuel
01:53
Yeah, you know, it happens and um it's all right. Like uh could we reveal the context of why we're having beers? Is that private? Yeah. We were out for um a few drinks with Glenn Moore, the comedian and Button Boys uh host who was um co-host, rather, there's three of them, um, who was performing in Bath. Matthew saw him, I rudely did not go to his um to his gig. But uh yeah, invited uh out for beers afterwards and it was Really, really nice. Uh Glenn was uh very funny and uh he told us about his apathy towards Capcom games and that was tough Matthew, but um otherwise a very nice time, wasn't it? It was good.

Matthew
02:28
Yeah, there were little bits where it was like, Oh, this this chat would be a good pod. Uh That was one of them for sure. But yeah, no, it was yeah, it was fun. No, it was good it was great seeing him. If you get an opportunity to see uh the rest of his tour, I don't know how many dates there are left. Uh it was really good. Uh yeah, it was yeah, it was nice to hang out. And yeah, wasn't too awkward or anything. Oh I wasn't too awkward. Um which is you know, really the important bit.

Samuel
02:54
Definitely yes. Uh I always whenever I see Glenn now I just make jokes about resistance fall of man because when he played it last year, I think he gave it one out of ten or two out of ten or something like that when he reviewed it on social media. And I have a soft spot for the resistance games I'm sure listeners know. I would never argue they're like anywhere near best in class even for the era they came from. Um but they um yeah it is funny just to see someone presumably streaming it via the PS plus service that offers the streaming back catalogue of PS3 games, which already compromises the experience. And experiencing like a brown PS3 first person shooter through that has to be pretty much one of the worst gaming experiences you can have like these days. So um yes, that uh it's just a it's just a great conversation starter. He's still not played Resistance 2. Um which is disappointing, but um I'll check in on that uh down the line. Um okay, so this podcast then um is a bit of a coda to our Grand Theft Auto4 podcast, which went down very well. Um three giant men play GT4 with Jeremy Peel. You'll notice that Jeremy is not here this time. Um it's uh just because honestly it's quite demanding to get. three people to play a 30 hour game, never mind the um twelve hours of DLC that goes on top of that. Um so it's myself and Matthew um tackling this but To complete the sort of GTA 4 conversation, it felt right to um revisit these DLC packs, which were a big deal in the moment. Um they were uh very much part of the conversation of which platform holder did GTA 4 belong to? Which was a weirdly uh sort of like heated uh uh sort of moment of I guess like games industry happenings in the mid 2000s because yeah, there was a a Microsoft deal um to exclusively put out these DLCs and at the time It was not mentioned that um it was a limited time uh exclusive and Peter more famously had a GTA 4 tattoo on his arm. And then later on it was kind of revealed that Uh for whatever reason, Rockstar had reached out to Sony to try and arrange some kind of exclusive something or some kind of exclusivity agreement like they had um with the PS2 GTAs and it didn't pan out and I think people use that as a stick to beat Sony with of you are out of touch as a platform holder and you don't know what you're doing. Um which was, you know, a bit of a bit true in the PS3 era. And it was a major like psychological victory for Microsoft, I think. And I was curious, Matthew, if you thought That these GTA DLC packs, the Ballad of Gaetoni and Lost and Damned, although I should really read those out in release order, The Lost and Damned, the Ballad of Gaetoni. If they were ever a big deal than that tattoo on Peter Moore's arm. Is that was that their like biggest moment, do you think?

Matthew
05:39
Uh uh in terms of like a big win, I feel like by the time they actually came along They while loved and talked about, it didn't feel like, oh, this is you know you know someone's taking PlayStation 3 out back and put a bullet in it or anything like that. It's it's uh But then I don't know, but then it i i uh Microsoft had a lot of these wins, so it it just felt like part of a yeah, like a general trend with them, that things were going very well and they were making good decisions and that they were the place to be. That tattoo, the the thing that it made me laugh playing the Lost in the Dam this time, which is about a motorbike gang if you haven't played it is that one member of the gang is like a like a legitimate businessman who sort of does it at the weekends. He's like a lawyer. And Peter Moore with that tattoo has got bigger that guy energy. You know? It's it's just like a meeting of two worlds, which obviously he couldn't have known when he put on that it wasn't a real tattoo, was it? No, it was one of his ma I think he has several fake tattoos. Yeah his face his body was just covered with promotional tattoos for the rest of his life.

Samuel
06:51
It was very much a like of that era sort of exec promotional thing to do, wasn't it?

Matthew
06:56
That was the sort of but I don't know, the the kind of sort of executive meets sort of hard edge of having this big fat tattoo. I don't know. It just it may it made me think of that guy playing it this time round. So yeah, that's my that's my observation on that.

Samuel
07:13
Thank you for participating in the podcast.

Matthew
07:15
I appreciate it.

Samuel
07:16
I thought that was a pretty good observation. Yeah, that is good actually. I think I can see that. It's it's it it's realistically observed because it's not like being a be in a biker gang is a full time job for a lot of people. You know, y'all you know, you need a secondary income you want to secure a mortgage, you can't be like, yeah, I just go around with these dudes wearing a jacket and that's my whole job. Um you know, maybe that would have been a bit easier to do back in the Hells Angels uh sort of like peak of the sixties, but I don't know about these days whether you could do that quite so much. Um and I think as well, like there's a heightened element to the fact that the that there is a biker gang that and a biker war going on in this um in this city that seems to be of some note. I feel like anything that happens with bikers you never really hear about these days. modern society. But um yes. I mean it's interesting 'cause Microsoft paid fifty million for that DLC and you know this was just as DLC was becoming a bit of a a battleground on these consoles and You know, yeah, you like you point out, Microsoft had a few things like this. They had, you know, Bioshock, they got that early, um, and that was a a massive win, I think, over PlayStation, uh being able to own that. Massive. Or say things like Yeah, Mass Effect, um, but also things like Call of Duty map packs coming out early on um Xbox back when those map packs were like the a huge, huge deal. That was the only DLC they were really selling. Um it just uh it just felt like there were a lot of things like that across the generation where Xbox had a favorable um tie-up, but GTA was you know, maybe felt like the biggest win because it belonged to Sony previously, you know, um in a in a in the sense of like it was so synonymous with the PlayStation 2, the three GTA games. So Yeah, um, interesting stuff. I will read out a bit about these DLCs to refresh the listeners because um, you know, I think some people observed when they listened to our GT4 episode like they'd forgotten so many details about the games. uh the ga about that game and I think that's fair enough because it's been such a long time. So GTA four, um the Lost and Downed, this released in early two thousand uh nine um on Xbox. It was seventeenth of February um that year. Um so uh About ten months after GTA 4 released. Um Johnny is a veteran member of the Lost and Notorious Biker Gang. Um Johnny has been creating business opportunities for the Lost in Liberty City, but his first loyalty must be to the patch he wears on his back. and to Billy Gray, the club's president. However, when Billy returns from rehab, hell bent on bloodshed and debauchery, Johnny finds himself in the middle of a vicious turf war with rival gangs for control of a city torn apart by violence and corruption. Can the Brotherhood Survive? Um I almost read out the next bit which is there are no refunds for this item, but that's because I'm on the Xbox store, Matthew. And this is part of the description, but I won't read that bit out. Um and The Ballad of K-Tony, which released in on the twenty ninth of uh October 2009. The Ballader Gay Tony injects Liberty City with an overdose of guns, glitz and grime. As Luis Lopez part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to legendary nightclub impresario Tony Prince, aka Gay Tony Players will struggle with the competing loyalties of family and friends and with the uncertainty about who is real and who is fake in a world in which everyone has a price. So yes, um those are two DLC packs that are later packaged together. There's episodes from Liberty City, and they did eventually release on other platforms on Steam and PlayStation 3. So The exclusivity wasn't really a big deal, to be honest. Um, but in that moment it seemed huge. That was in two thousand six, the Peter Moore tattooed. So it was quite a long way away from GT4 actually being you know, around, people even knowing what the game was. So um yeah, and you couldn't even really imagine what a GTA DLC pack would look like in that moment because, you know, your frame of reference is San Andreas. You're like the idea of selling you more more GTA you thought you're like, wow, what what will it be? And then it what it turned out to be was um two story packs, much shorter than the main the main campaign individually, but um set in the same city, Liberty City from GTA 4. and um adding new features and uh yes um uh different types of missions than maybe you saw in the main game with Nico Belic and uh new protagonists each one. So Yeah, um pretty ambitious for what DLC was at the time. Um I was wondering if you had any expectations for what these DLC packs would would look like at the time. Is it worth establishing what the environment of DLC was like in the first half of that 360 generation? Because everyone was kind of figuring it out as they went. And the response to some of that stuff was really strong. Um and the winners felt like the big winners, but the th the stuff people hated, people really hated. Like what do you remember about that era of DLC?

Matthew
11:49
I remember it being a thing that every game had and there was always a bit of a question over you know, what form is your DLC gonna take? Is it going to be, you know, another two hours of campaign? Is it gonna be some multiplayer maps? Sometimes it was an entire multiplayer mode it seemed. Um there are lots of cosmetics. Uh there was there was horse armor, who could forget? The Oblivion Horse Armour. Um but it also I don't know if looking back at it, it it seems quite quaint. uh compared to sort of how mercenary things are now and I oh I have a sort of fondness for it. I think part of the weirdness of that time was because Xbox, you you you use like Microsoft points or Xbox points or whatever they were called instead of money, although the obviously the money was turned into points. It all seemed quite abstracted. you know, it was like, this is eight hundred points, this is six hundred points. I think these DLCs were like si either sixteen hundred or eighteen hundred points, um, which was about twenty quid. And I always thought that points thing kind of made you feel like you weren't really in you know, dealing with money in a way. You know, it's a bit like getting prizes at a fun fair pier, you know? It's it's it sort of felt like this sort of slightly kind of sort of pretend space where you know sometimes amazing things happened and there was a lot of daft things you could just ignore. But everyone was doing it. So you know anyone who could like you know get everyone talking about a piece of DLC. Like you really had to move the needle, I felt. You know, there was a lot of talk at the time about DLC being the sort of front line in the war against pre owned game selling and trade-ins, like the idea being that if you held on to a game, you know, if if you put out good DLC for it, you can't do it. people wouldn't see the need to then sell that game back to, you know, CEX or whatever and eat into the the game publisher's profits and you know that really dominated headlines for a couple of years and now that feels just with the way things have gone and th you know the prevalence of digital and everything, that seems incredibly quaint. So yeah, it's like a really um It's like a completely different world that this this DLC was released into.

Samuel
14:07
Yeah, it was. PC, they were selling expansion packs for PC games back in the day. I mean, you know, what is Half-Life, Blue Shift, or Opposing Force but just a DLC pack, really? That would have been If that was an Xbox game most.

Matthew
14:24
What's the Ballad of Gay Tony of Half-Life?

Samuel
14:35
Uh they're both kind of opposing force really in terms of um sort of quality and going for it.

Matthew
14:40
Who's the Tony Prince of the Half-Life universe?

Samuel
14:43
A Barney, I guess. I don't I'm really reaching here, really grabbing at straws. Um, yeah, so those things did exist. Like they were, you know, they They'd say they've been selling like the Sims packs and the like for a long time, but yeah, even single-player games they did do this and Yeah, and so they just didn't have an easy way of s way of selling this stuff on on consoles, even though there was some DLC on the original Xbox that you could buy. Um But uh, you know, the the potential was there for to do some quite interesting things and I think overall the landscape was mixed. Uh I was never really into the idea of buying maps for multiplayer games, that felt pointless to me. Um just felt like chucking money away. because you know the majority of the player base will be playing on the same base game maps anyway.

Matthew
15:27
One of the worst freelance gigs you can get is writing the DLC page for a magazine and having to write the review of a m for a map pack You know, you've got like eighty words on a Call of Duty map pack and then you're just you you can only describe them in the most superficial ways of like Whoa, this is like a chilly forest or whatever. You know, you weren't like, oh it's got all these amazing sniper spots and You know, this is the kind of intensive game that will play out there and you just feel like such a fraud. I don't think you can possibly write 80 words on a map pat and not feel like a fraud.

Samuel
15:59
The funny thing about that is nothing in the sentence you just read out is like exists anymore. Like you cannot buy DLC maps for first person shooters because they're normally given away for free because they make money on cosmetics instead And you cannot write about such a thing for a magazine anyway, because you'll never find a magazine that reviews like DLCs in that.

Matthew
16:19
I would love to see that. I would love to see like Today's magazine staff writer, the theoretical magazine staff writer of the day, trying to review a Timothy Chalamet skin. in Call of Duty Warzone and being like, I've got eighty words to review. I I guess how much this looks like Paul Atreides.

Samuel
16:38
Uh yeah, it's the i you are you do identify something very specific that I remember though, so uh yeah, I know what you mean. Like it was But it was definitely a thing, you know, they I remember Halo three having a bunch of them, Call of Duty Four having a bunch of them, but ultimately if you just had those space games, they were they were pretty packed with content, you had loads you could play. It's not like you were gonna get bored really of the maps you had before the next one. came along. I mean the next, you know, uh I guess you had to wait three years for the next Halo, but the next Call of Duty was out one year later and the next Call of Duty by that studio was out two years later. It's like no No time at all really. But in terms of single player DLC, it was it was interesting to see people's like take on it. Like you mentioned horse armor, but uh some of the other Bethesda DLC was pretty interesting like um Broken Steel when they extended the ending of Fallout Three. Like um you could you could keep playing it afterwards. They like New Vegas and Skyrim had a bunch of them as well. And the Mass of It ones were a real mixed bag too. I mean One of them is actually Lost to Time, Pinnacle Station in Mass Effect 1. I don't believe they could get in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. And that's almost like a black mark against this DLC as well. It's like if you later can't Back it up or put it in the gable whatever. Like maybe you should never have made it. Maybe it should have just been in the game. So the files weren't lost. Um like they are for that. Um it's not like you're missing out on loads of Pinnacle Station, but it was like, you know, it's part of the game that's just not in the version that you can buy now Um yeah, so there was that and yeah, I think though that Rockstar, because they are Rockstar, I think they were like, when we do this, we're gonna be we're gonna be the most maximalist version of this. And I think that was true with both this and the um Undead Nightmare pack for Red Dead Redemption, which I think is very much not in conversation with this, but like it of a similar it's a similar attempt to do something quite rich um with the base game and the base setting of the of an open. open world game. Less so the DLC packs for LA Noir, which really should have just been in the main game and later were. Like those were those are pretty pointless to to take out really.

Matthew
18:39
That that came someone's been stealing my milk from my porch and you're like, Really?

Samuel
18:43
Find this one in Um Yes, it does yeah that's when you get put on the neighbourhood watch desk. That was tough. That was not a good not a good time for Coal Phelps back then. Um yeah, so uh that was basically the landscape it was coming into. People were figuring it out and um and they were normally about 1200 points to 1800 points in that kind of range. And like Matthew said, they just felt like, you know, it didn't feel like real money um because of the point system more generally. It's one of the reasons in which why the PS3 was a bummer by comparison because all they gave you was the cash you were paying and it was like I don't want to be confronted with that, you know? If I buy Banjo Kazoe uh sort of like HD on Xbox. It's just it's just points. It's not real currency. If you write that down as like s 18 quid, then suddenly I'm quite depressed about it. Don't do that, you know? Um yeah, so uh I guess Matthew, what do you remember about playing these DLCs. What was your first experience of them?

Matthew
19:39
I didn't I don't know if I actually played them immediately. I th I'm pretty sure I didn't, just because it took me so long to finish GTA four and I was playing it in fits and starts. I thought well I can't play these until I've actually finished this game and it took me so long 'cause I got stuck on um Pegarino's Pride right towards the end of the game as discussed in the um previous GTA four episode. So Yeah, I like you know, I I read about them, I watched them being played in the office, I had a sort of sense of them. Um, you know, I didn't I didn't feel like oh I ha I have to be on top of these. And then when they did come out, I don't think I actually finished either of them. Playing them this time. Like I don't remember much from these at all. Um certainly like the later missions in both. So uh you know I'm I'm willing to Yeah, in fact achievements were popping, so I couldn't have completed them before. Um yeah. So this is li this is your first time playing them basically. Yeah, certainly certainly to completion. Like I d you know, there's stuff where I'm like, well I definitely got up to this bit because I remember doing all the parachuting and bass jumping stuff in Gay Tony. I guess the thing that str struck me this time that, you know, playing them both in in quick succession with playing the bass game, but also playing the bass game knowing that these exist and that these are coming, is that I I don't think I ever properly uh sort of glommed onto the fact that they were like running in parallel and were finishing. kind of storylines set up in the main game. We didn't talk about it when we talked about GT4, but one of the things that did strike me playing it was Oh there are actually some quite egregious loose ends here, which I know get tidied up in the DLC, but without those uh it it would be quite unsatisfying or it's quite flaky. And also I'm I'm surprised they didn't make more of that at the time, you know? Like there's a version of events where they say you know, play the DLC, finish you know, finish the story of GTA four, um, which is maybe overselling it, and maybe they didn't want to do that because of the exclusivity. But I'd say that structure and that pitch is clearly baked into the entire project by the fact that these DLCs are so clearly set up by the main game. And the characters appear in them and you know, they must have known they were always going to do this. Like it's not that they made GTA four and then were like, what can we make in seven months? Oh this thing about bikers Yeah, so like how kind of integral they are to the overall GTA 4 project, that is definitely not something I registered way back when, but now feels yeah, quite uh major to me.

Samuel
22:21
Well the thing I would say in response to that is that I actually think it feels a bit crowbarred in the idea of the Well uh well no uh in the sense that The there's no real reason for the the diamond quest, the diamond storyline that goes on in GTA 4 and Who has these diamonds, who's in control of these diamonds, and then how they kind of end up not really belonging to anyone in the main plot of that game. Like there's no real Nico Belic reason for that plot to happen. It's really just a plot that is a is a it's a large enough plot to get the other characters involved and for there to be a lot of like back and forth between missions. And so I think when you play it back you notice that that that particular plot is does feel manufactured to make these characters all kind of intersect. But I don't mind it. I think it's like it's quite a fun thing the game does.

Matthew
23:14
But I'm surprised 'cause the these games were so speculated on at the time. You know, and I remember reading articles about oh what do you think the GTA four DLC's gonna be like, you know, after GTA four came out. And now it seems screamingly obvious. Well, one bit's gonna be about that bloke who turned up in that window, who who doesn't make any he never ever appears anywhere else. What's his deal? You know, and the other bit is this this other character who turns up and you know, drives around on a motorbike, you know, what's his deal? Uh I mean maybe that i yes, it's it's it doesn't really exist outside of that storyline and you are right and like Nico's Python that storyline isn't massive, but yeah, I don't know, I really laughed when I saw Lewis shooting everyone through that window. I was like, well there he is That's the DLC.

Samuel
23:59
The thing is though, people did c correctly speculate this at the time. I do remember I remember specifically chatting to John Denton in the office about this and he was like, Oh yeah, there's actually I think this is shortly after GT force release. There's some guys who like turn up, you know, because each of them I think turn up at least twice in the main story. Luis is obviously Luis is obviously in three leaf clover on the ground. Um in the bank. So it's not like and that's the start of the, you know, historian the Balladigate Tony. So, you know, I some people did notice that they were foregrounded a little bit, but um Yeah, you're right, it is it does seem when they turn up it is it's got a bit of a it's me, Bloco um element to him, um some sometimes for sure. My first experience of these DLC packs is that I reviewed Ballad uh Lost and Damned when I moved on to X360 magazine at the start of 2009. And I really had no expectation for what it would be. And to be honest, I remember n people not really caring that much um about these DLCs. Like it was Yes, this was uh the year that Rockstar was hyping up Red Dead Redemption massively, and that game was the number one on everyone's radar. This game's gonna be a masterpiece. You know, everyone was paying attention to that game. And, you know, some peop the people who were already cool on GTA 4 weren't gonna change their minds. And I think that games m you know, we talk about now about how games move on so quickly. But back then they they did as well. There was plenty more to think about and talk about in you know, the rest of 2008. If you think about what came out after GTA four, you had Fallout 3, Dead Space, Mirror's Edge, and you know, that massive glut of amazing 2008 games that came out. um it's one of the best ever video game years. Um I don't think it was like a huge moment for most people. I think it was really for the devoters to enjoy more of their the thing that they liked. And that was how I felt about it really. I thought Here come some DLCs to add this like fresh perspective onto this setting. Um I'm playing as different characters. I'm in Aldeny a lot, which is a place I didn't remember super well from the main game. There was just enough time had passed from the main game, uh playing the main game as well to come back and really appreciate Liberty City as a setting, you know. Um I think like having t 10 months away, you can start to sort of like, you know, mythologize it again in your head and be like, you know what, I'd actually do fancy going back there. Um I think you do have a feeling of like unfinished business with the setting. It certainly doesn't outstay its welcome in the main game. So yeah, I remember being excited for it. And then when um Balladergate Tony came out, I think I played that I think I might not have played that at launch. I think I might have played that when episodes from Liberty City came out on disc format. Like it might have been early 2010 or something like that when I played it. Um But I did I was I was excited for that too, but I was no longer working on um I don't think I was working on X three sixty magazine at that point. But yeah, reviewed the Lost and Damned and just remember thinking, I can't believe how much, how many cutscenes are in this, you know, how they've put new music in it, how they've put new game features in it. That was very much my response at the time, Matthew. So can't believe there's an actual penis in this game. That does happen. A penis that doesn't move. It is like uh you know suspended in midair and there's no physics on that penis. There's no Uh what's it? Euphoria physics called? Euphoria? That's not a euphoria piece of things.

Matthew
27:14
Euphoria, that's more about like people gripping onto stuff with their hands.

Samuel
27:17
So I'm glad that it actually isn't in there. Yeah, it's not like a pedestrian going by just desperately holding on um to whatever he can grab, thank God. Um yeah, so that's what I remember about it. But I mean I was gonna ask you what your favourite DLC pack was at the time, but it doesn't sound like you finished them, Matthew, so No, well I w I w I will I would always have said I

Matthew
27:37
Gay Tony just because it had the f the fun stuff that I remember, the fact that it had more stuff up in the air and you were jumping off buildings. But, you know, interesting to sort of reevaluate that take. Now.

Samuel
27:50
Yeah, I mean that is the that's the mad thing about these DLCs, right? They added so many features that weren't in the base game, you know? Like um particularly like you say uh Balladegatorny. They both they both add weapons um to the game, um for sure, but in Ballader Gatorney they add base jumping to the game, which is, you know, th if there's one thing that GTA four lacked, it was, you know, features that involved The sky. Like, because it was in a New York style setting, they didn't want to use airplanes for obvious reasons. So you had helicopters, um, which were fine, but like um, you know, they didn't even have I don't think they even had helicopters with guns on them in GTA four. It was such a conservative take on what you could do in the sky. Um like it was amazing and it was an amazing city to see from the sky. So that felt like a bit You know, like you could you could do more there. And so yes, they also added like a um a helicopter that could shoot uh machine guns and rockets in Balladergate Tony 2 and um And they also just added like new types of missions as well. Lost and Downed adds these gang war missions where um a lot more NPCs can be on the screen on your side and on the other side to Mm make it feel like a big battle's going on, even though when you interrogate it really closely you notice that no one's actually shooting each other unless you get involved with this. Like a sort of it's like going to some kind of wild west town where they're all pretending to shoot each other. It's like Westworld or something. They're all on their lunch break. Yeah. It's a bit like that. It's like a lot of half Mr.

Matthew
29:12
Blobbies.

Samuel
29:13
Yeah, is there any other kind of like really key new features that I'm missing there, Matthew, that that are added? I like our gosh like checkpoints as well, right? And the ability to replay missions, that was added more with um with the Ballad of Gayetoni, the the mission replay part certainly, and adding opt optional objectives to get like a higher grade in a mission. Anything else, Matthew?

Matthew
29:36
Um and wrestling. Yeah, I think they add some mini games as well, don't they add air hockey to Lost and the Damned? That rings a bell, yeah. I don't remember air hockey being in GTA four.

Samuel
29:47
I never went to play air hockey with little Jacob. No, that's correct. And um uh the ability to have like a dance off as well in uh in lo that's that's added to Lost and Damned and No Like a nightclub management as well, that's in the Lost and Damned. Um, although that's pretty um that was just a a guy calling me to do some busy work and me ignoring him really. That's what that amounted to on this playthrough Matthew. So my next question was gonna be, I mean What holds up well about the Lost and The Damned and the Ballad Gate only playing them now?

Matthew
30:16
So the Lost and the Damned, I thought my big overall take for this game was it felt like their first attempt at doing the gang culture that kind of goes on to define Red Dead Redemption 2. Obviously on a very different scale, but I I thought it was interesting that narratively It's about what it is to be a you know part of an organization and part of a group with lots of kind of clashing personalities. the tension between Johnny and Billy Gray, the leader, like there's there's a little bit of Dutch energy to that from Red Dead 2. It Also like just working as a group and going out on a mission together. I mean it's it's definitely not as developed and we can like talk about that in what doesn't work as well. But I I do wonder if you know you always wonder about the genesis of ideas in earlier games for later games, and you you know you do wonder like, or you know, did this dynamic somewhere in the back of their head go Oh you know what, there's a there's a whole game in this. Um but that's you know, it gives it its own character, which is like pretty impressive for DLC.

Samuel
31:22
Yeah, I I agree with that. I think um uh while we're sharing overall takes on this then to sort of set the table a little bit, I I will say that I think that the idea of playing as different characters in the same environment is still is still kind of cool, you know? Um I will say though that they They feel a bit more like themed mission packs than they did the first time because I played them s so close to back to back with GTA 4. Right. Um you really, I think You you see that yes, they you know they did think ahead on the story stuff and weave it together quite nicely, and that is obviously them gesturing at what they would do in GTA V with the three different protagonists and Perspective switching and that is cool. Um but they definitely I would say Balladergate only in particular feels like uh we you know w Let's just do some really cool shit that we didn't get around to doing in GTA four because we're still figuring out how to do this series in HD. And They feel very much like jam-packed with like the new features and the new tools and that kind of stuff. And, you know, even less plausibly like something the main character would be doing than they do in GT4. Um so In a sense there's sort of like Trojan horsing in, lots of like cool new missions uh under the in these kind of like you know uh sort of like richly themed guises, if that makes sense, you know? Yeah, and that's like I say, particularly true with the the stuff they get you doing in Balladergatoni is absolutely mad that you'd say yes to any of it or that yet it's got anything to do with like this sort of like nightclub manager boss or whatever. It's all just completely preposterous. And that's where it's really it really breaks from the I think the more contained reality of Nico Belic. He does get on up to some stuff, but he never get some of this like borders on like sci-fi and superhero stuff. It's just so sort of out. So it's much more Saints Row. Definitely, yes. So they're they're really cutting loose and having fun. I think that I know I feel like I noticed more the design thinking behind the missions themselves more than the overall kind of illusion of it's a different perspective on this amazing place you've been to before. Even though that's still part of the mix. So that's how I sort of felt about it overall. Playing them this time also, I think it is fair to say that even even with that, like feeling a tiny bit cooler on them than I did at the time, It is absolutely a setting that justifies having to being revisited in this way. Like they des the setting deserves it, you know what I mean? Yeah. So That was something I felt. Anything else that you um that j you know that you thought held her well?

Matthew
33:53
You know, specifically in the Lost and the Damned, I d I do quite like the gang mechanics. You know, given that it is you know, just a little side story. I I think they they give you a surprising amount of stuff to do. I like the fact that you've got like your little headquarters and it has some sort of biker specific mini games in there. There's a very easy higher lower card game that you can play and that's that's all fun. I like that you can kind of call your gang in to help in missions. I like that you can ring them up and then some AI guys turn up, even if like you say they don't really do a huge amount. It's the illusion of having your mates turn up, it's quite good fun. Um I like I like for the opening stretch of it anyway, because this goes away quite quickly, the riding in a pack and it has this stupid little mini game where if you uh this like big biker symbol appears behind the leader and if you trail in that for x amount of time it triggers like a little bit more chatter on the way, which is always good to kill the drive, but also gives you a little bit of bulletproof armour and you know given that I'd just come out of GTA 4 where you spend so much of that game going to ammunation to buy bulletproof armour so that you can have a chance at not getting like instantly eviscerated in the next mission, which is just like the gameplay loop of that game. Buying armor is baked into every mission when Nico's involved. I like that they had a mechanic for the first quarter of the game at least, which lets you uh turn up at battles with a bit of bulletproof armor. I guess it's the portion of the game where you don't have much money. to spend on bulletproof armor, so it kind of makes sense that they would gamify that and I don't know, I you know, I I like the chatter, I like the banter, I like being in that world and um, you know, hearing like five people do a little radio play as they they're on their bikes. I like it that halfway on the way to the mission when the banter runs out, they're all just like, Should we have a big old race to the mission? And then it becomes a little race. That's fun Uh, you know, just it just does more than it needs to do. Uh and and all that sells you a little bit on the illusion of a gang. Um, you know, which I felt like They probably did a better job of selling the motorbike gang angle than Gate only does selling the nightclub ownership angle?

Samuel
36:15
Yeah, I mean it's not it is sort of like it tries to give you this underground culture and I think six largely succeeds because Yeah, like it when you go to the the sort of like um biker gang hideout, it is like this very slummy kind of area. There's loads of um uh dudes around that just fake dudes who are in your gang. This the but they're like quite particular looking NPCs so it feels like you're part of something. Whereas the nightclub It has like one of those blokes on the uh on the you know, the door, basically, and the doorman. But then in the actual club itself it's just sort of, I don't know, regular NPCs dancing really. It's not There's not loads to it. I don't know if like yeah, it's not it's not hugely immersive, but it's it's nice window dressing, you know?

Matthew
37:01
Yeah, definitely. The only downside to the the Losts uh clubhouse is that whenever you go in, it's always playing like the most raucous radio station. Like it only plays like the most obnoxious What's the radio which has got like It is a Liberty City Hardcore? Yeah, Liberty City Hardcore. And if I could walk into that clubhouse and just switch the radio to the journey, that would be like I'd add an extra point on for that. Yeah, I mean I feel like that clubhouse are clear. I'd get kicked out quickly. Yeah.

Samuel
37:32
Like this guy's definitely a narc another observation on that clubhouse is that it's a fucking nightmare to navigate as well.

Matthew
37:40
So complicated.

Samuel
37:41
If you go up like one floor you're fucked. Like s good luck finding anything from up there. Once I figured out where the save room was was, I was like, right, I'm going I'm never going anywhere else in this clubhouse now. I jog to the s safe ha the safe room, then I leave again. Yeah, um so it does sort of it also pulls off the biker gang thing without it being embarrassing and that could quite easily have been embarrassing, I think. So uh Yeah, um anything else that's age well for you, Matthew?

Matthew
38:10
In in both has got a slightly more overblown mission design. Obviously Gay Tony's got really overblown, but You know, just the appearance of a good old-fashioned turret mission when you're sitting on the back of a bike blowing up police cars with like an automatic shotgun. I I loved that stuff in San Andreas. It's a nice palette cleanser when you don't have to do all the work and you can just enjoy the the mad spectacle of the thing. So I was, you know, given that as the the the designer said in that GTA 4 episode, uh, you know, there's like four missions in this, which is like drive to a place shoot some guys, chase some guys or whatever. You know, this adds sit on the back of the bike and shoot some guys, but you're not doing the driving and That's that's that's a nice uh change of base.

Samuel
38:56
Yeah, in general I really respect the fact that they went for it with the missions in this.

Matthew
39:01
Like it's

Samuel
39:02
It's a bit like they read the people who were like, oh, I like Saints Ray better than this now. And were like, well, fuck you, we're gonna make the the coolest missions we can using. You know, we're gonna expand the tool set of what we can sort of use to build these missions by adding some cool weapons which play nicely into the um You you know, euphoria physics and certainly the the automatic shotgun absolutely does that. Um but yeah yeah yeah it's just like uh you know we don't have the angst of Nico Bellick hanging over the game So we can c we can kind of we do have an excuse to cut loose and so it's gonna be really heightened some of the stuff you get up to, but um but really but just really entertaining and I think that sort of design the attitude of that, you know, design is sort of um yeah, it really ages well. So I like that about it. Uh yeah. Anything else that ages well for you, Matthew?

Matthew
39:50
We talked about how Gaitoni takes you up into the skies, both with more helicopter missions and the base jumping. It's just nice to kind of consider the skyline as something you're interacting with and Parachuting down it. That that's that's great. Oh no, actually, and even outside of that, I think um I think they both make interesting areas. There's a r I really like the mission with um Maury, who is um Brucey's horrible brother, I think. Where you're like racing the cars along the banks of the of the island and It's it's just like a racetrack d along basically the you know the riverside property and uh you know you're like, oh I've never been here. You know, the the main game never took me down here or up here or whatever it is on the map. So Uh that I that I really liked. I just I just felt like they really understood you know what they'd done in GTA 4 and responded to it really well.

Samuel
40:58
Yeah, for sure. Like um I mentioned this on the on the main episode we did, but the being able to go to the airport, like I I think you have a couple of excuses to go there in this, but Um just like one where you just go to an airport, shoot someone down in a helicopter with a rocket launcher, and that's the mission basically, then escape. But as I mentioned, like you go to that toll booth Um many more times than you go to the airport. And the air an airport's a cool location in a GTA game. So it's just nice to to see them like do a bit more of that. Um I completely agree. Well it's yeah it is. It just it has you know it's it these are locations that you might not think about in GTA. You do sort of like get your own sort of stomping grounds and the same three or four streets you're going down all the time. So I appreciate that about it as well. Anything that holds up less well about them, Matthew?

Matthew
41:43
My biggest criticism of both of them, and it's slightly different for each, but you can roughly bundle it under some narrative stuff. In Lost in the Damned, while I think it does this like proto Red Dead Redemption 2 thing, I think it's also it's so short as a as a game and as a campaign. that it's it's a story that doesn't really have any time to breathe and it plays out quite manically. Like y the the the central conflict, which is Billy Gray, has come back into the gang that you've been running. and is instantly disruptive. You know, that's established basically in the drive home from the prison. Then Billy Gray does a couple of like shitty things and gets you involved, and then he fucks off for the rest of the game and you're like, oh You know, th the whole sort of defining tension of this main character is here for like less than an hour, it feels like Uh and then he pops up at the end where, you know, I'm not saying this should be a Red Dead Redemption 2, like sixty hour, like overblown, you know, absolutely underlines every emotional arc fifteen times, which is almost like it goes too far the other way, Red Dead Redemption 2, but I I would happily play a longer game or you know, or a campaign that just spent a bit more time maybe establishing like what Johnny's gang is before Billy Gray turns up. and then what it is to be excited about someone's return and then disappointed because they've changed over time or like prisons changed them or they're not quite who you remember. You know, that's That's the kind of slightly more sophisticated stuff that I think people do respond to in Red Dead Redemption. And maybe they don't want to go too deep. uh and you know, get too psychological in GTA because it's meant to be fucking fun GTA, right?

Samuel
43:37
But Well, they did but they did a GTA 4, that's a good idea.

Matthew
43:43
You know, but I feel like they Yeah, I d I you know, I I don't know what the solution to that criticism is. It's not real you know, it's it's more of a oh I w I wonder, you know, if there's you know, I wonder if these characters were afforded the the lives and the time that like Nico had if actually they'd be a a bit more rewarding. Um and and that's Lost in the Dam, which I, you know, as a story I think has you know untapped uh potential. I think my bigger problem with Gay Tony is like I I really don't like a lot of the characters in it. And I find the central Lewis Gayetoni relationship incredibly confusing from the off. And throughout the game, it's just all over the place. I don't I don't ever really know what the stakes are. And It feels quite frivolous as a result. Like the missions are really fun, but I couldn't really tell you while I was ever doing something in particular.

Samuel
44:40
Yeah, I think I largely agree with this. I you know, I I think if you were to Uh uh have another go of this, what you'd maybe do is not have Ballad of Gaetonian then just extend Lost and Damned into two episodes so it becomes like a fourteen hour two episode campaign and then and then maybe like the second episode concludes the story but then brings in some of the extra features that um you know, the balladigate only has so maybe he is doing mission th through Yusuf, maybe he steals a helicopter, maybe blows up loads of helicopters while he's on top of a train like Lewis does.

Matthew
45:12
I mean Billy Gray took up base jumping while he was in prison.

Samuel
45:16
The thing is so, but there's no real reason they couldn't have done that sort of thing in Lost and Downed. It's not really like it's any more plausible that Louise does that stuff, is it? So That could be one solution, and then yes, I think that Johnny Klebitz is a slightly stronger character well, much stronger character than Luis. I don't think Johnny Klebitz is hugely distinctive, and that was actually one of the things I would say on a replay is I think in my head Johnny Klebitz was Kind of a bit closer to Nico in terms of quality rock star protagonists in my head, but there's not really that much of him in the campaign. Like he's He's a bit of a he's he's m he's much more sort of defined than Luis, but he's a little bit still a little bit sketched out like what his deal is and what his motivations are. Um like he's yes he cares about this biker gang and um he gets uh you know shit I think maybe just the just the kind of people he's around, you get shit for being like the Jewish guy who's in this Spiker gang. That's interesting to to put that in there as like a a in a an element of the character to sort of be discussed. But it doesn't really go any deeper than um some people just sort of make making snarky comments really and that just being part of the culture of the the gang itself. And then he has this, you know, relationship with Ashley who's just like drug addicted girl who is a very thinly sketched out character. Um and so I don't yeah, in my head I thought like, oh yeah, Johnny Clevitz is up there with like, you know, John Marston and Nico as the GTA protagonists. But It's not that's what I thought held up slightly less well is. In my head I think I thought that was a much more substantial story and character than it actually is. Like what do you think of that?

Matthew
46:50
I would agree with that. I uh it's almost a shame that like Nico didn't get to hang out with Johnny as a friend. because i he actually he would have been one of the better hangs in GTA four if he had sort of existed in that capacity in that game. But you're right, he may be it's it's not it's certainly In The Lost and the Damned, I don't think you see enough of him, you know, I just don't think he has the time to like bed in as anything more you know, he just has to turn up and basically state This is what I'm about, these are my values, this is what this character's about. We have conflict because his values are different to mine. And that that seems very rushed, you know, like the You know, the most you really learn about him is if you go to like an internet cafe and read his inbox like you can with with Nico as well. You know, you can you can see what other people have said and you can get a like a sense of his backstory with Ashley and stuff and you're like, well, if this game had had, you know, the first act that GTA IV had, you know, if Billy Gray turned up basically after the tutorial act you know, you could feel that that you know, that slightly richer character. But I mean I think he is a good hang. Like I don't I don't hate him at all. I think he's I think he's quite a good guy and he's like mates with like the nice biker the gang is basically made up of like nice bikers and nasty bikers and all the nice ones sort of like him and all the nasty ones like Billy and maybe that's a little bit on the nose but it it does sell you on the idea of like Where the n you know, we're the nice bikers. What was that film with um all the incredibly handsome bikers that came out a couple of years ago?

Samuel
48:24
Oh, uh The one with Austin Butler and um He's like Austin Butler biker, you know?

Matthew
48:28
He's like soulful nice. He's not like mad Tom Hardy biker.

Samuel
48:33
Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean. Um Yeah. Yeah, I sort of I suppose as well, like you know, the hangout mechanic does return from GTA four here, so I could have fo phoned up his friends, but I'd really just had enough of that from the main game and didn't really fancy going for a you know, going drinking with any of the with Terence or whoever his biker mates were coming with a call now.

Matthew
48:53
Two Burley bikers playing air hockey is weird. That is that's that's like a weird thing to observe if you're working in the bowling alley where the air hockey is. I'd be like, uh-oh, we're in trouble. Oh no, we just want to play air hockey.

Samuel
49:05
I was not expecting that. I really wish I'd played air hockey now ahead of this. It's clearly had a quite an impact on you. It's come up a couple of times already.

Matthew
49:11
So um Well it was just 'cause I it was me and the other guy were playing air hockey, but two other bikers from the gang also came along. And just like observed.

Samuel
49:22
Well that is the that is the odd thing though about these DLCs is that, you know, they are in the shadow of GTA four to some extent. And I think Johnny Clebitz just about stands up in that shadow, like because he is You know, like you say, I think he he maybe has the Nico thing of the thing Dan Hauser said about he might be too sympathetic, he might be too morally in the right, um, to be a GTA protagonist and Certainly in GTA five, it seems like they punish Johnny Klebitz for that. Um with his his fate in that game, which is quite a nasty a nasty thing that happens in that game. Um so yeah, no, that's that's interesting. Maybe that's them reckoning with the fact that Ah, maybe we had too much morality in 24 and what people actually want is like three bastards. Yes, almost certainly what they were doing, wasn't it? So um whereas Luis is You know, it's a complete nothing character really. Um, but I also think that they've that's perhaps a deliberate decision because They wanted a background him and foreground gay Tony, who I I I'm slightly confused by what they were going for with that character as well. I think that they were kind of reaching for this End of a certain era of nightlife guy. Um I feel like Rockstar loves the end of a certain era of something, kind of like storytelling. That's definitely something they could kind of go for over and over again. Like a guy who's over the hill Or the Wild West is coming to an end, but in this case it's like nightclubs are slightly different now. So it doesn't feel like particularly pressing as a you know as a theme for the game. Um And meanwhile, it enables Luis to do the most uh exotic missions in the game that are completely ridiculous, but for you not to be like questioning the morality of him doing it because you're simply not invested in him as a protagonist. But then you can still level that as a criticism at the story of this game, I would say. Like it's uh He's the he's a nothing character. A literally everyone in his life is a nothing character. They are all pointless, especially these two little mates. Those guys fucking suck. He Um his d two mates who are like, Oh, you've changed since you moved to the city, man, and that's literally their entire character. There's no other substance to those characters. So Yeah, I definitely narratively weaker than GTA 4, but that's mostly because GTA 4 set the bar so high with that. Yeah. So um yeah. Anything else that holds up less well, Matthew?

Matthew
51:35
Uh no, I mean generally it it you know it just does a lot of what GTA 4 does, but with slightly more enjoyable missions and and even if If they aren't enjoyable, I think it's counterbalanced by the quality of life improvements, so you maybe wouldn't notice anyway, because you just get through the game a lot faster than you do GTA 4.

Samuel
51:55
Yeah, I suppose like um yeah, I definitely want to ask you a bit more about some of those quality life changes. But I I thought I would ask if like you think replaying them, do they do the DLCs genuinely add a different perspective on Liberty City? Because I think that is what uh you know, s was s suggested about what the DLC's achieved in their moment. That um, you know, that they uh that maybe like the noise filter they add to Balladagate only to make the, you know, just the picture look a bit different or the the pink sunsets you get in the Balladagay Tony, or like just the fact that you're a different character living a different life, you live in a different place and all this kind of stuff. Do you think it succeeds at providing a different perspective on the same place?

Matthew
52:35
I I'd say it succeeds enough. I wouldn't say it's like you know, an absolute kind of pinnacle of this like narrative device of like, you know, I don't think it it sells you on three different lives in the way that GTA V maybe does. Though I I'm willing to litigate that when we come to do the GTA 5 episode. Um so don't hold me to that. Um I haven't replayed it in a long time, so I'm just I'm not entirely sure if all the characters actually get like equal equal sort of billing in that game.

Samuel
53:07
Um I remember being um yeah, it's it's a little bit of a a a split I think, but maybe Michael and Trevor get the the meat of that and uh

Matthew
53:17
That's that's that's what I'm sort of expecting to to discover on that replay. But um yeah, with this, I think, you know, for what they are as like s you know, side add-ons, I think you do get a sense of what it is to be other citizens in this city with a life uh who are part of a different culture. I think what it maybe does best of all, rather than sell you on how deep their individual lives are, I think it really does underline what a good job they did with Nico's story and campaign, in that I think he seems even more alien by comparison. Um I think the fact that I mean this might just be corner cutting, but the fact that like the socializing and making friends You know, it's an element of the DLCs, but it's it's definitely it's not really part of it. You know, it's it's it's it's there, but I I wouldn't say it's like a a key part of either of their lives. And That being such a cornerstone of like Nico's existence, like just trying to get a foothold in the city and make friends and have some contacts and have a network and how important that is. to him to get by. I think that makes his life feel, you know, a bit slower, a bit more sort of hard scrabble than th these two lives. And Just to have that difference, I think, is a success. Uh as as far as the three of them go. But like there's definitely a version where they absolutely like take you into different like three different tiers of society, which I don't think they've done, because you basically end up doing the same kind of stuff as all three of them. working with the same kind of people. Like they you know, you're always indebted to some asshole and that's what all three of them have in common. But but you know, there's some sort of fine detailing which I think does sort of separate their three existences, which I liked.

Samuel
55:11
Yeah, for sure. Um I I think it it for you know for a Xbox 360 game of its time, I think it's pretty sophisticated in how it does that. Yeah. even though I think playing it back to back maybe illustrates uh maybe sort of doesn't allow you to to buy the uh to buy that as totally as I I s as I certainly did in the moment where I was like, wow, I can't believe I'm back in the city, but it feels a Just different enough from what I remember before. And that was the goal, you know. These these weren't designed to be played back to back with GTA 4, you know, they were really spaced apart, and that was the perfect way to experience them. So I'm still willing to give it that for sure. Like they do um yeah.

Matthew
55:48
I like the perspective of when you're in Liberty City, sometimes you're the guy in the natural history museum who runs right. Sometimes you're the guy in the natural history museum who runs left. And sometimes you're the guy outside the window shooting at those guys. And uh I thought that was pretty deep. Yeah, that's really what, you know, I uh Is that what you're talking about about perspectives?

Samuel
56:08
Basically like Yeah, not getting obviously but But the real winner is the you know, is obviously Luis who gets to jog up onto the roof and fly off in a helicopter and and not have to fight his way out. I mean, I feel like if Nico knew that helicopter was there, he'd be like You know, fuck it, I'm going to g I'm getting on the roof of here and I'm getting out of here because that's a pretty brutal firefighting. You don't see the helicopter taking off when you're playing as Nico or Johnny, right? No, you don't because you're in inside the museum, but I feel like you would hear it. Do you know what I mean? Like there's a helicopter on top of this building leaving. Nonetheless, um yes, Nico's just in there going, Oh fucking Gil you and all of his other odd barks that he has during firefights. Um yeah, Luis is just punted out of there. Um yeah, so uh you know I think it's like I say, I think they do feel more like mission packs when played in close proximity to GT4. But yeah, I'll definitely for their time, I'll definitely willing to give them the they added successfully added to the perspective, and that's definitely part of why they're remembered as fondly as they are. Um so let's talk about those quality of life changes to the DLC, Matthew. They didn't put these back into the main game. And I wondered if you thought that's like is that insane in retrospect to not go in back in and put in like checkpoints to not go in back in and put like you know replay the missions and you can hit all these optional objectives. It just left the base game as it was. And then all this stuff existed in the DLCs by themselves. Uh what do you make of that?

Matthew
57:32
Yeah, uh you have to think it was just like something baked into the game that prevented them from doing that. There's there's no other reason. Like I I when I was doing this, because the the way the checkpointing works is a little funky. Like there are checkpoints, but you get punted out of the mission and then you have to use your mobile phone to retry them. But whereas with Nico that takes you back to You the very beginning of the mission before you drive to a place. Like here it might take you to where the mission actually starts or in some rare cases you start, you know a third or two-thirds of the way into the mission, like it has actual checkpoints, but there still is this weird bit where you're you know, you're dead and then you walk out of a hospital. Like the game doesn't have a respawn if you don't walk out that hospital or something. Like I can't work out what what what made them do that, but there has there has to be a reason. But you do think, yeah, like What why is this checkpointing not in here? Um why is the mission select only in like the mission replay only in Gateoni? Um, you know, I could understand if it was in the Lost and the Damned and Gay Tony and not the base game, but to to sort of do it in little kind of dribs and drabs and you know, these are all things which are now absolutely commonplace and, you know, just to be expected from Rockstar games. So I mean was it really dawning on them that slowly? 'Cause that's what it feels like to play it in succession, like a company going, Oh, maybe actually it would be good with this and then Oh actually maybe it would be good with this also and you're like, really? Is that how this worked? Yeah. Yeah. It's like a rigidness to it. I also think it's really weird that All the new weapons aren't in ammunition. Yeah. Like you have to have a special NPC in both packs that brings you the specific weapons from that pack. And I'm like They're just Liberty City just must have some things in its bones that don't let them meddle with it.

Samuel
59:27
Yeah, that's a really good point actually because It's not like surely it's not based on the fact that there's only a a particular number of surfaces in ammunition on which you can place a certain type of gun because Wouldn't you just have both guns there and then you'd kind of zoom in or something like that? You'd find a way to do it. But yeah, instead they just exist as they are. But like Yeah, I don't know. I mean you sort of uh you know the the kind of like ideal version of this would have been something like what they did in GTA 5 where you could switch protagonists and Access the same content or similar content or like you plug the content from Balagatoni back into GT4 so Nico can base jump or he can go he can take little Jacob to the air hockey or whatever it might be. But instead, yeah, it just lives off by itself. But I do think that I think part of it is Like you say, might be technical related, but I also wonder if it's just because at the time Rockstar was so busy because they bounced from this to Red Dead, that run of like Red Dead Ellen and um MaxPane 3 and GTA 5 in successive years. An absolutely, you know, unbelievable run. And I know that not all the same developers are working on all those projects, but they were certainly were getting to the point of that time where they were they were becoming more of a single project kind of studio and moving between all these games at once is probably a lot of work and um yeah so maybe it just was one of those things where they thought, well GT4 isn't gonna sell forever and ever, so we might as well just move on to the next thing. And you know, now obviously we live in an era where it would have been worth their while you know, for GTA 5, um, which is a very complete game in and of itself, at least as I remember it, you know, there's uh they sort of like um they've invested their energies in GTA Online instead, but also like the yeah, the the single player felt kind of complete as it by itself and it's kind of kept selling based on that. But GTA four is oddly It's odd having all these different bits of it partitioned off, you know. Um it's it's just that the most complete version of the city is technically the one in the Balladagaitoni, but it's the one you least want to spend time in because it's a character you don't like. So it's uh It's just a bit odd how that worked out.

Matthew
01:01:38
Oh man, the price you have to pay for a parachute is like just hanging out with that asshole. What do you think of the new weapons they added to each DLC pack, Matthew? They're a lot more powerful and fun and they make things explode a lot faster. Um I really like the the shotgun stuff that they add in the Lost and the Damned, like the Sornov shotgun and the assault shotgun. They they feel as a bit of narrative design, they feel very like Johnny coded. You know, it's like this big sort of blunt forced trauma, up close and personal. It's not very sort of sophisticated, but it's quite kind of like you know, it's in your face and honest about what it is, um, which feels right. Whereas Gay Tony it feels like he has that I wouldn't say it's high-tech, but s a lot of it's like very like precision and it feels expensive. I absolutely love the assault SMG That thing is just it's so fast, it's so deadly, and it it does change the rhythm of the combat. Like to go through a a f you know a third-person shooting segment, particularly as Lewis feels much deadlier and efficient to me to my fingers anyway than Nico did. And I you know, I don't know if you know, with money comes efficiency and ease of use and ease of life. Um and I thought yeah I s you know, I thought it conveyed that s somewhat.

Samuel
01:03:01
Yeah, I think that the um The automatic shotgun with explosive rounds in um The Battle of the Gate Tony is a top ten video game gun for me. I think it's an extraordinary bit of kit. And it's like It's so f it's so unrealistic as a thing. It's so ridiculous as a thing. It can destroy a car in like three shots. It's unbelievable. And it can turn like cars into cubes basically with the sort of d the f the physical damage it does to them. Um and it just when it hits dudes, you're like, you just know that's the most painful thing in the world that's collided with that guy. Um like explosive rounds and a shotgun that fires automatic rounds. That's just ridiculous. It's it's so heightened, but I do love that about it. So Yeah, I I love it. I love the kind of cut loose feeling of some of those guns. Yeah, that auto SMG is really nice because so the assault SMG is really nice because I don't think it's like hugely accurate, but it sounds great, you know? And uh that's kind of almost enough sometimes. And yeah, you're right. One of the first missions you do is Luis is you're sort of like um moving through um quite a lot of corridors in this building, uh sort of clearing dudes out in Chinatown, I think. And you uh feel like much more effective with that weapon than Nico ever did with his weapons. You feel like you kill So many more dudes, and you also I think see Rockstar getting more confident with building third person shooter levels, you know? That level that level is actually quite a lot better than any of the s m most of the straightforward cover shooter levels in GTA 4. So certainly if you compare that level, Matthew, to the one um where you go to that uh that sort of like uh sort of empty building, that sort of hollowed-out empty building where all the cops turn up at the end and you're sort of going from room to room, clearing those dudes out. Like an abandoned house. That ha that That level is a real pain in the arse in terms of watching your quarters and dudes fucking you up at close range and your armor being wiped out in two seconds. It's m you have a you have loads more space in this level and you know, more entertaining a more entertaining weapon to do it with. So that's one way in which I like seeing the you know how Rockstar build on what's in GTA four. You just see them getting better at certain things in real time, you know?

Matthew
01:05:15
Yeah, definitely. I love the sticky bombs as well. Oh yeah, so they've I just like the the control of like throw it and then deconate it with an another button pro. So I'll I'll always you know Ever since Goldeneye Remote Minds, I've been into that shit. So um to have it with those crazy euphoria physics and sending people flinging around. There's a shootout in a c like an underground car park in Gaitoney where there's just loads of agents driving in in cars and you're just blowing up all these cars and they're blowing up all the parked cars and there's just nothing like that in the base game. It's really exciting.

Samuel
01:05:49
Yeah, it's great. They're sort of like it's almost like they built the they built tools that could offer them the maximum number of level design possibilities, which is so different from the more reserved nature of GT Force missions. That is the thing I wanted to ask you about uh next, Matthew, was whether Uh are the missions too good in the DLCs? Do they spotlight how conservative the mission design w actually was in GTA four?

Matthew
01:06:14
Yes, but you know, if you just line them all up in terms of quality, I think the DLC ones, you know, there'll be way more of those at the the the top of the spectrum than than there are GTA 4 missions. Though that said, like one of the benefits of playing all these in quite quick succession, which they obviously you like you say, they weren't designed to be. And actually th there's there are some benefits to having downtime between them in terms of, you know, being able to appreciate different elements of them. But I think when you do play them all together, they f they feel more like In in terms of difficulty and creativity, like fourth and fifth acts to GTA 4, like there's quite a nice through line of just when things get a bit hectic in GTA 4. Here's a load of hectic missions to follow on. So I didn't I didn't really feel like they undermined it. I thought they they felt like good endgame missions uh on this particular playthrough.

Samuel
01:07:08
Yeah, and they are sort of sufficiently different as well because of the the new tools. So yeah I like the idea of that. They're like an extension of it. I think with the I think that the Lost and Damned has more missions that are in like the Nico warehouse. More in the Nico wheelhouse, not the warehouse. I mean that Nico is in a lot of whe warehouses to be fair. But you know what I mean? Like th they are sort of it's just that they're a bit like the Nico missions, except there are loads of dudes there. You know what I mean? Like it's They won't always be that different otherwise, or you'll be on bikes more than you'll be in cars, you know. But you have a grenade launcher which can change the Tone of the conversations. For sure. And you know, you can do cer different things with that. Like there are, you know, missions where you blow up, you know, sort of you set fire to a building or clear dudes out using that. And it is it is more entertaining, but generally speaking, the scope of the missions, those missions, feels a bit more like something that Nico can get involved with. But Balladergate only really just pushes it that step further. So I like the idea of looking at it as you know, connect this like connective tissue in terms of design back to the base game and it doesn't yeah, it doesn't undermine it. I think that is true. Were they at the same price when they both came out? Yeah, I th I let me let me think. They might have been in the twenties.

Matthew
01:08:22
Cause Gay Tony feels like a bigger game to me than The Lost and the Damned.

Samuel
01:08:27
Yeah, I it's I think but I think I'm pretty sure they were the same price. How much were the GTA 4 DLC in points? They released for 1600 points each. Yes. So both about $20. Which is, you know, really good. But yeah, you're right, like um Balligator does have more it does give you more a little bit more for your money, but um You know, it's I guess they probably thought people would buy both, so uh, you know, I I suppose it wasn't like a big deal to them either way, and they packaged them up and put them on a disc anyway.

Matthew
01:08:57
I can understand with the last mission that they have in Gay Tony of them wanting that to be mate like the last mission in GTA four. Yeah, absolutely.

Samuel
01:09:06
It does feel like there's an arc to how that that plays out. Um I was curious, Matthew, on that subject, do you have any favorite missions from uh from these DLC packs that you wanted to spotlight in this episode?

Matthew
01:09:17
In Lost and the Damned. There is like a s sort of turret section where you're on the back of I think it's Malcolm's bike. There are two other bikers you meet in the campaign and you're just racing away from these police and I think it's 'cause you can't normally use the automatic or the assault shotgun and you can't use that as a drive-by weapon in a vehicle but sitting on the back of the bike you can and you're just unloading into cars and It's you know, it's probably the uh you know, at that point before Gayetoni, the most explosive I'd ever seen GTA 4, with just like cars flying off the road and people flinging everywhere and you were like Oh, we are really pushing the these euphoria physics. This is great. Um so that was really fun. I quite like the final prison mission in Lost and the Damned.

Samuel
01:10:02
Oh that's great fun that mission. Breaking into a prison to kill.

Matthew
01:10:20
you know, it's really exciting and then has this great, like, you know, narrative ending to it. It's it's not quite uh it's nowhere near as powerful as the Dark O' stuff in GTA four, but the idea of like You get to have this sort of private moment with the person you've got to kill and the person who's the source of all your problems. You know Th that's that's a pretty pretty strong ending to a game.

Samuel
01:10:43
Yeah, for sure. I love that in that um that prison mission you get you get to blow up the gate yourself as well. So You just get out the rocket launcher and blow it up. So good. I think it e I think you can do it with um with like a pipe bomb instead if you want to as well. But or the grenade launcher, but it's Yeah, it's really fun. Is that prison there and that detailed in the base game? Uh I don't think you can go inside the prison.

Matthew
01:11:13
see if that level is in there. Oh no swear the prison's there, right?

Samuel
01:11:16
I they haven't a yeah they haven't added that in No, but they did add the um for loss uh for Balladergate only they do add that golf course, right? That big um the big uh sort of like cage around the golf course. Like I'm pretty certain that's not in the base game. Maybe I'm wrong or maybe there's a version of it in the base game, but you certainly can't. No, so I'm pretty sure they just layered a level on top of whatever was in there in the base game. Uh I'd have to go back and check to be sure, but yeah. Um yeah, so I I do um I definitely echo that. Like I think that more of the mission highlights are in um the Balladegay Tony. Like the I'm a a big fan of uh for the man who has everything, which is the one where you have to steal a train car to help um Yusuf um mayor steal a train car and that basically involves crawling up all these different uh sort of like yeah the the different uh sort of carts of the train basically like the um what the fuck are they called the train cars, yes. But the different you crawl up the train cars to get to the front and then So this guy can steal it basically. But what it all really involves is you being on top of a train shooting down tons of helicopters, and I mean loads of them, um, with the weapons of your choice. um while going past the like Coney Island riff and it's like such a great use of the setting that there's nothing else like it in the rest of GTA 4. And so I really like that as a kind of we're properly going for a mission. It does have the caveat that you have to duck at certain points or you get like knocked off and automatically fail the mission. That is a pain in the dick. And also I think there's a problem with the frame rate on Xbox when where when you hit the helicopters, they spin twice as fast as they should do, giving them a slight Benny Hill quality, which is undeniable. However Um shooting down helicopters with a shotgun is just great fun, man. Yeah. That's um that's really good. It's not a great mission, but I do like the fact that you're inadvertently when you steal a prison bus inadvertently um liberates um some kind of like cannibal uh serial killer and release him out into the streets. Um I kinda like that um to it Matthew. I think that's quite a fun um idea. Um

Matthew
01:13:23
What about uh worst missions in the DLC? A couple of others I do like from Gay Tony. Yeah. I like the one where you parachute into the building, then have a gunfight in the building, and then jump out the window and parachute down again

Samuel
01:13:36
That is cool, yeah. Like, um, it's uh something quite funny happened to me in that mission where I threw the um the timed explosive into the room with your target, right? Blew it up and killed him and then the game like acknowledged that I did it. There was like a small cutscene and then placed me in the area where you jump out that you do the base jump onto the the street below. But um because I hadn't killed the other NPCs that were in that room, there were like six dudes immediately next to me who just executed me because I'd basically skipped the step where I killed them. And like they added the dudes who are already scripted to come in and then the existing dudes are already there and they just completely fucked me up. And I thought I was so clever because I was like, I can't be bothered to do this properly. I'm just gonna blow them up and then see what happens. But Yeah, that was suddenly like a room full of dudes with machine guns killing me. Um but it that is really cool because you have to land on a truck at the end of it right. Um yeah, it's nice.

Matthew
01:14:31
To be honest, there there weren't many that I I really don't like. Like I think I think the the general quality in them is much better. Like I'm actually trying to think. I I g I I was never very good at the The helicopter combat controls. A lot of fuck-up sort of like crashing into the ocean. There's a bit where you have to steal this like experimental attack chopper from a yacht and Then you have to go back into the yacht and shoot loads of people and I just kept crashing into the sea and dying.

Samuel
01:14:58
I mean that was more just me being cack-handed, but That but that mission's so good if you just ace it straight away. And that's that was my experience. Blowing up a yacht with a helicopter that has rockets, you're like, yeah, this is This kind of is what I wanted there to be a bit more of a GTA four, you know?

Matthew
01:15:15
It's pretty exciting. Like that takes me back to San Andreas where you know, again, anything with like helicopter combat I was always a little nervous of because like it's very 50-50 whether I actually understand helicopters and GTA and you know sometimes it would work out fine and I'd sort of fluke it and then sometimes it would just be so upsetting. to die again and again. So that's probably more of a me problem. There's another one we have to shoot down police helicopters for that helicopter and I was I was bad at that as well.

Samuel
01:15:45
Yeah. I have to you gotta say give a shout out to the last mission though, right? Where you uh Uh it's called departure time. You have to go and kill Ray Balgaren. And you know, we we mentioned it earlier, but it feels like it's supposed to be the last mission. of uh uh of GTA uh for it more generally. Like you get onto his uh you get onto his airplane while it's taking off and kill him and you just get uh that little bit closer to that sort of San Andreas kind of like scale of mission that GTA five would give you. And it's a really nice way to see out the whole thing and then um there's like uh you know you you parachute and then go down to the city and then um yeah like some music plays and it's such an inverse of the GTA four sad ending, you know?

Matthew
01:16:30
Yeah, because Tony's like, I'll meet you in this park. So you have this objective of like can you parachute from this plane all the way to the park I slightly ballsed it up and like f ended up like a couple of blocks short um same brother. And then you just have to do like a a rather embarrassed jog to the emotional ending of the game, but that was fine. Um yeah, I and anything which ended with like a a lovely Parachute ride very gently down. There's that one where you push the blogger out of a helicopter and then catch him and then um parachute as well.

Samuel
01:17:03
That was that was quite good fun. S side note, is there anything more late 2000s in this game than the mission objective where Gay Tony's like, oh I need you to, you know, reach out to this blogger who is mean about me and sort of like s say that wasn't on. And he basically Luis leaves a very polite comment being like, hey man, you wrote something a bit salacious about us in your blog. Don't do that. Why don't you just have a conversation about it? It's like it's so pre P like Nazis screaming kill yourself on Twitter that would become at the norm several years later. Like it's a really like naive like Perez Hilton sort of view of celebrity. You know, that whole world that became so much worse than anyone could have imagined. That was funny.

Matthew
01:17:44
Yeah. You ever you ever thought about pushing someone out of a helicopter as a as a PR tactic?

Samuel
01:17:50
Uh it depends how bad the coverage was, to be honest. You know, like a sort of I'd save that for like a four out of ten. Yeah, you know. I think I I j agree generally. Like they're they're they're pretty strong missions and you don't get stuck for that o that long on any of them compared to GT4.

Matthew
01:18:03
I think that's the m that's the main th Yeah, point of difference is that if if there are weaker missions, they they never become horrible missions because of the the you know, the slightly more generous checkpoints and everything. Um You know, like uh the missions in GTA 4 are probably fine. It's just the frustration of the replay that makes you sort of turn them into these like ogres in your mind, which they aren't necessarily, you know, as bad as that.

Samuel
01:18:28
Yeah, and I certainly didn't find it quite as bad this time as maybe I remember some of them being, and part of that is just experience and you know uh it's also just like understanding that You don't have to load in and lose money and weapons and ammo and all that stuff. You can just you can just save it. You can auto load in and it's very, very quick, and it's not a big deal. Um, are there any missions so that you consider low lights in this Matthew? 'Cause I definitely have one that I thought was crap.

Matthew
01:18:53
Oh which was uh no, I can't th I can't think of any off the top of my head that that really offended me, so I am Oh I'd actually I'll tell you what the one that I know the one that I died on the most was the the big nightclub shootout. Oh, that's really hard. The second to last. uh corridor. Some of them come up the stairs and w you know, th the the th the third person cover in this game it just isn't quite up to you switching out, turning around, shooting the stair guys, coming back, shooting those guys, and that was uh I that's where I died the most in this DLC for sure.

Samuel
01:19:34
Yeah, um I for for that one is very annoying. That it's sort of like um it's uh really like aggressive just how fast they push in and how You're sort of limited really in the options you can use to deal with them. You kind of just have to have your most efficient weapons to do it. You can't really plan that strategically if you If you all if you s if you try to like you know, remote sort of bomb your way out of it, it's just too slow. But it actually would have been much more fun for the game to be like These guys are pushing in, they're gonna be here in like five minutes. Make sure the place is tripped out with like, you know, and so maybe when all the dudes run in you could detonate them and it'd be really cool. But instead it's more like Carbine or automatic shotty, and we'll just sort this out and move on because it's a pain in the ass.

Matthew
01:20:19
It's probably one of the biggest body counts of any mission in that one mission. Uh you you keep so many guys in one tiny room, so it ends up feeling like quite surreal and silly.

Samuel
01:20:29
Yeah, it does a little bit. I I would say there's like quite there's a couple of nightclub shootouts in this, and I would say that The other one that you do in this, I would say borders on domestic terrorism, like the shit that you you sort of get up to in that one, because you're like, you're in theory you just gotta kill the enemies, but it's a nightclub with loads of people in there dancing. And like you have a falling out with a dude and then you shoot your way out. And you know, it's quite hard to avoid hitting civilians in that instance. And there's something about civilian screen. running screaming out of a nightclub like that while you're opening fire that it's just a bit like it is a bit like oh I don't know about I don't know if this is good. You know what I mean? I don't I'm not sure this is all right. What plays some probably demented pop song on the radio. Yeah, exactly. So um yeah, uh but the the mission I was gonna say that I thought was the worst one was and I remember thinking this mission was alright at the time, which is um hit the pipe where you have to throw those pipe bombs at this vans in um the lost and damned. And timing the actual pipe bombs to explode when you want them to. Like, the the UI prompts are not very good for that, and I feel like I fucked that up about twelve times before actually doing it.

Matthew
01:21:37
Uh so I did it tried doing it one time, fucked up, and the next time I did it, I did it with the Sornov shotgun and it it it didn't it didn't mind that I did that.

Samuel
01:21:45
What I wasted all that time trying to perfect the timing.

Matthew
01:21:48
Those vans weirdly can take two shots from the Sornoff shotgun and they explode and I was like, oh well I'll just drive around shooting them with this instead That's a much better idea. Fight bombs out the window. It just doesn't make any sense. The tight the m the ability to drop a pipe bomb out of your driver window so that it goes off by the time a van drives over it is so unlikely.

Samuel
01:22:13
So that's ridiculous and I f I I didn't fail the mission at all, but I just I had to go and get armor and health about twelve times during the mission and it went on for about felt like like 30 minutes, me doing it, and I just thought this is shit man, I hate this. So That was bad, but in general I thought the mission quality was higher as discussed. I guess to talk about the characters more widely, Matthew, we've talked about Johnny Clebitz and Louise there. I was wondering if you had any more observations on on either of them, but also what you thought of their supporting characters. Um because you alluded to to it there. Are there any other like non-Belens in the cast of um this game or is it Bellens all the way down?

Matthew
01:22:49
I think like you the the The couple that are properly loyal to in The Lost and the Damned are alright. I mean they're not massive characters. There's there's a guy called Jim, who's like the accountant, I think. of Lost and the Damped who's like your best mate in the gang. And he's just very supportive. He gives you some good weapons. He turns up Um, spoiler alert doesn't make it to the end of the game unfortunately. Tough. And then there are some other members of the gang who are just the guys who turn up when you ring for help. You know, they're just I mean I don't know if they ever say anything really. Um I don't know that you can actually hang out with them. One's called Clay. Clay and something else. Clay and Jimbo or something. And um They're alright, because they don't they don't really say anything awful. Um Gay Tony, that's it's kinda much harder. I how do you feel about Yusuf?

Samuel
01:23:38
He is a bit too much, I think. Um he's not quite likable enough to sort of but he also the game also goes for a very sort of like superhero comic book coded moment where at the end you really need some help and he turns up with his helicopter. And I think you're meant to go, yes Yusuf, but In your head it's like, that's a cool moment when that helicopter turns up, but also you're like, this guy is definitely a dickhead, you know.

Matthew
01:24:03
Yeah, he's he's weird because he's cut from the same cloth as so many GTA four characters. incredibly arrogant, cocky, speaks really offensively, like his language is just absolutely vile. You couldn't quote any of it. But for some reason there just there were a couple of cutscenes with him where it did make me laugh. Like I don't know if I was just worn down after playing, like, you know, forty, fifty hours of GTA four that that that humour finally got to me, but just his just crazy sort of swagger and and just how ridiculous he was and I think it's 'cause it's Omid Jalili who voices him The uh that's what Yeah, the British comedian who I quite like and you know I I've actually you know, I'm going to see him years ago do stand-up and stuff. So Yeah, maybe there's just like a little bit of sort of res residual affection for him coming through there and and he does his missions are just absolutely wild. Um and they come out of nowhere. Like they always start with him going, like, let's go for a drive and then he just pulls up and goes, Right, jump on that train now and you're like, What the fuck? Uh that's that I quite like, that kind of school of You know, the best missions in this game don't necessarily feel like it when you start them.

Samuel
01:25:16
Yeah, it's true. I also like that his dad turns up at one point and And sort of like that does I think that does highlight his ridiculousness because, you know, his dad's like, you're a fucking idiot, basically. And Um and yet he's like oh but I still want you to do this mission I'll just I'll come outside and give you a bell afterwards. I do like that that that they try and do that, but um Yeah, I agree. He is all he is like a device to get you doing the most ridiculous shit, but it's um like you say, it's all it's almost always a good time when you're playing this, and that your mission is great. Um Yeah, in general though, I didn't really um it like To Tony Prince is another character who when I first played out would have been like, oh yeah, Tony Prince, you know, you do missions for him and stuff. But as I mentioned, I don't Don't massively think there's loads to that character or or at least like whatever the themes they're reaching for. It's just not it's not that interesting compared to some of the other stuff going on in GT4, you know?

Matthew
01:26:10
Yeah, I I didn't do much reading around this, so you know, I d I don't know what how how he's currently held, but it was interesting on the Wikipedia page in the response to the game there was a bit about, oh Tony Prince was sort of celebrated. as this LGBT video game character and being like slight a slightly more sophisticated depiction of that you know in a series which has you know, up to this point not being entirely kind to that community. Um and by the way, still isn't in that DLC that he's got to be. I was as I was playing it, I was like, is he is he actually a sophisticated gay character? Like is he is it trying to have its cake and eat it by it just being like a part of like I I guess the sophistication is that it's part of his life. It's just like who he is. It's not like, you know, compared to um Bernie in GTA 4, you know, who's this sort of sort of limp-wristed sort of m mincing guy, it's like Absolutely ridiculous stereotype. Tony Prince, like, isn't that? Uh you know, he's just a gay guy. But The other characters, I feel like because he is gay, there's even more slurs about gay people in this from the other people who don't like him. And I don't know if this is like necessarily a win for the LGBT community.

Samuel
01:27:29
Um that some people maybe labeled it at the time Things I never thought I'd hear Matthew Castle say on this podcast. That's so it's just Yeah, but no, you're right. I mean the thing is though But i because just because those slurs are in the game, that they you know, that's not to be mistaken for this is like a d the developer's point of view on it. It's much more it's much closer, I would suspect, to the developer's point of view. is like Luis who doesn't is non-judgmental, who doesn't even think about Tony's lifestyle other than like about him as a friend and the the bad sorts that he maybe gets in gets in bed with quite literally and what that sort of like, you know, might mean for for him in a kind of negative sense. He's looking out for him as his friend, and when his when Luisa's own um shite friends, who are like the crappest NPC companions ever in a rockstar game, I would say When he meets them and they make jokes about uh Tony being gay, crucially Luis doesn't really respond to it or weigh in on it or like you know, just even re and that's that's uh that is several steps forward, I think, from you know, uh again like OG Loke, uh some of the jokes at his expense in um in San Andreas or yes, uh Bernie in GTA four. So yeah, I wouldn't call it a win either. Um and it's not hugely substantial, that's the thing. It's like Yeah, it's just he's just you know he's a he's an okay hang and he's just very he's sort of like very dramatic and he's in too deep with all these guys and He is more interesting than Luis by comparison, but doesn't have loads going on psychologically. It's just he just sort of rep he represents a certain scene in In the in Liberty City. That's really what he's there for, you know?

Matthew
01:29:12
Yeah. I d I I just think there is a there's a better version of this where that relationship is a is a bit better defined and Tony is maybe a bit more consistent in his behaviour and your struggle is Red Dead Steel. I mean it's a bit more sophisticated than that, but um but w you know, what yeah, who Tony Prince is, I th I is he's very different, like mission to mission, cutscene to cutscene. Like I never really know like what guy I'm gonna meet. You know, is it the one who you've got some real history with? Or there's some where he seems like a total stranger and it's it's just quite uh I don't know, uh w one of their more sort of inelegant characters uh with with regards to that.

Samuel
01:30:11
Yeah, I think that's I definitely think that's true. Um it's also interesting that the game cycles in uh what I consider like the slightly disposable Russian characters from the Nico arc. So Bulgarin is a miss a guy you take missions from then a guy who betrays you in this and Again, Bulgarin's sort of like backgrounded by the story of GTA 4, um, isn't he? Like you meet him and then he seems like he's gonna be the big bad, then he isn't really, Dimitri is. And Um that's kind of a bit unusual. And then yeah, so that has there's a very dark joke in this where he shoots the ceiling where his sister's screaming at him and it's implied that he kills his sister um with like this gun while he's playing music downstairs and you're like this is so fucking bleak man and and I'm here playing as this guy who I don't really like as well. Like it's I don't like anyone in any of this in these cutscenes. This is really bleak and I don't I'm not having a good time necessarily. Um but again the missions are are pretty good. Um I did wonder what you sort of uh what you made of the Maury character and the decision to bring Brucie back into the game. What did you think of that whole thing?

Matthew
01:31:14
Uh I mean it it made me feel a little bit more sympathetic towards Brucey, just because he is to Brucey what Brucey is to everyone else. This like horrible roided up menace who's just like constantly on your case? Is it maybe a little bit Stockholm syndrome that you've spent you know, a ca whole campaign with him and then a little bit of this that you're like, Oh maybe Brucey Brucey isn't as bad as Maury. Maury's like much more objectionable.

Samuel
01:31:41
Was in the Israeli military, I believe you commented when um you were on a mission with him. Um interesting detail.

Matthew
01:31:48
It's weird there's just like another Brucey when Brucey exists. And the kind of missions he does, you know, there's no reason Brucey couldn't have given you those himself. I maybe they're just really fond of that character or they thought Brucey would be like a big breakout character. So it's like it's like the sitcom episode where you get to meet like a character's parent and they're like a bit like them or a riff on them. It's like, oh let's go a bit deeper on Brucey.

Samuel
01:32:12
Well, I like that you get a little bit of Roman in Balder Gayetoni as well, because he likes going to nightclubs. You get a tiny bit of Roman around the edges, which I like. But I liked it. I think Brucey I I don't mind him so much. Um I think that it doesn't help that in GTA four he has he can call you and ask to hang out. So you feel like you're being hounded by him, which maybe compounds the problems you might have with them in the cutscenes. But I find them very sort of winning in this when you do sort of like when Maury is emasculated and put down. And Brucey has his moment. I was like, oh, I quite like Brucey. Like I'm sort of I'm kind of fond of it. Yeah, and I think it works just because they yeah, like you say, they make Maury so objectionable. He's such a piece of shit, but You know, Luis even comments on like you're like the worst guy I've ever met. And um but it does also make you think, was he worth putting in as a character if he makes you feel this way? Like is that a win for the game necessarily? I guess you could argue that because it has that narrative moment of him getting is just dessert, like perhaps. Um but yeah. Uh in general, like yeah it's just like the thing about Brucey and Maury is like they're

Matthew
01:33:18
At the time, you know, they're representative of a certain culture, but it's the it's like the first step to something which now exists and is much, much worse. So they're so tame in comparison to like the Manosphere. Um but like they are the 2008 version of that.

Samuel
01:33:36
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. It's sort of like Toxic masculinity that seems again extremely quaint really by comparison to uh to the horrors. Brucey walked so Andrew Tate could run. Yeah, so um uh it's Yeah, so I was wondering if you had any thoughts on any of the other characters. Did you also hate Luisa's mates? I just and his mum? They're just such like dickhead characters. I just didn't really know what they were.

Matthew
01:34:05
Like I'd kind of completely forgotten that the opening to the game is like a little bit of tension between his new life and his old life, because his old life is so quickly abandoned. Admittedly, I didn't do a lot of the drug war stuff, which I think if you invest in those missions, you do those with his two childhood friends, trying to get their business off the ground. So I don't know if like narratively they have a bit more to do there or if those missions are just drive to a location, shoot loads of people.

Samuel
01:34:33
Yeah, it's um I I and I didn't want to find out basically. I was like that's that's fine, thank you.

Matthew
01:34:38
The the couple of missions I did in the drug war, both times the the two childhood friends died in the missions. But like, you you don't fail if they die. Their car blew up. We're not gonna see him again, man. You know, it's kind of sad that he's like, alright, bye, bye, my best friend. See ya later. And then and then you know, later on you see them and they don't mention like, ah man, I hope this mission goes better than the last one. Where we blew up and died.

Samuel
01:35:14
Yeah, I know what you mean. Um The w the one mission where you're sort of stuck with those guys, you have to go down to that boat and em in like investigate that boat. Then loads of dudes turn up on an elevated surface above you is one of the worst missions in the DLC pack, also actually, because like It's really hard to get a shot on the guys shooting down at you. Oh yeah. And you do have to protect those motherfuckers as well. And like my first instinct was, I'm gonna blow up these jeeps that just arrived with a rocket launcher, and then it's like Um such and such, a name of guy who I whose name I didn't even bother to learn for this podcast because he wasn't worth it, Luisa's shit mate. um is dead and I was like, well, that sounds like a net win to me, so why don't we just call it quits and carry on with the game because I don't care about these dudes but And his mum's just like such a mean character. Um and it's just sort of like it's just because Because you don't care about Luis more generally, and they don't really add any dimensions to him. They actually just underline the fact that he is such a one-dimensional character because his whole world is just full of archetypes, you know? And it's just Compared to like the time and attention they give Nico, it's just it just doesn't add up to much, you know. So yeah. Um Yeah.

Matthew
01:36:23
And they get they they do get better at this because Again, all of this is open to to reiteration when we get to the GTA V episode, but in my mind, each character had like a small circle of friends who were alright. Like I remember like Franklin's got a really funny F friend, right, in GTA five. He's not really funny.

Samuel
01:36:42
Lamar is a bit annoying.

Matthew
01:36:44
Oh, it's in like his memory.

Samuel
01:36:47
I think he was a bit irritating, but um yeah. I mean again jury's out, you know, you may feel differently but uh I'm not gonna weigh in on whether GTA five does it better then because I I haven't played it for a while, so Yeah, I mean th but they do try and give each character their own little world of you know, other characters like that.

Matthew
01:37:02
Yeah, like Trevor's got those like two weird mates who hang around with him and Michael's got his son and his his

Samuel
01:37:09
Family of the family.

Matthew
01:37:10
Yeah. In hindsight, maybe not great.

Samuel
01:37:14
Well that's the thing is they kind of have each other in that game, don't they, the the characters. And whether they like it or not and um have that kind of fragile alliance that I guess so yeah it will be interesting to see how it compares. But well it's it's okay though, but I I think it's only You only really make the comparisons one to one because Nico Bellick is, you know, also in Liberty City. So when you have Luis and these quite throwaway companions, you maybe do They just don't stack up. But then that's because the intention of the of the DLC is different to the main game. I don't think they're meant to be interrogated in as much depth, although you can hang out with the his li his mates, but There's no chance that was ever gonna happen when I was playing this again. I was like, why would I spend more time with these um yeah, these very, very thin characters? I don't think I would um choose to do that. Like why would I spend time with these two flaming corpses? Yeah, they're canonically dead, Matthew said. Um okay, so another thing I wanted to highlight is uh and I think is a really deluxe touch um for uh the the DLC packs is the the new music they added to the game. They added You know, they went back to the ra radio stations and added new music, um, which I think is like phenomenally generous. And again, it's a way in which I think they able to uh they were able to um elevate the uh you know the what kind of like um the base game was and uh you know adding to the game in a way that's DLC packs from that time weren't necessarily giving them, you know, these different games the same substance. It felt like a bit of a flex by Rockstar. So uh they crucially do add some new tracks to um uh to uh liberty rock radio um which is it forms like a key part of um uh of the lost and damned in particular where that music kind of comes in. But I th I did kind of want to use this as an excuse to talk about my beloved radio Vladivostok Matthew.

Matthew
01:39:00
Yeah please so I mean so I I will say my my very brief thoughts on the music. Each pack affects like a handful of radio stations, none of which were like necessarily like my favourite. You know, I listened to a lot of the journey as outlined, and that one is basically untouched. So I am more interested to hear your radio takes.

Samuel
01:39:22
Yeah, I mean I will say that I think that you definitely see the most upgrade with um uh what they add to Liberty Rock radio with Lost and Damned. And you'll notice some of this music when you're you're playing it as well. Like um Bon Jovi's Wanted Dead or Alive, for example, plays over the closing credits of the The Lost and Damned. So super obvious. So too does every picture tells a story by Rod Stewart. I mentioned that on the previous episode and I thought it was a really good but The In general, it tries to tap into a kind of like uh, you know, biker sort of music vibe with what they go for and Liberty um City Hardcore, they basically double the number of tracks on there, I think, to again like enhance the f that the feeling of that side of Liberty City.

Matthew
01:40:04
But I was a more soulful biker who listened to a lot of Philip Glass. Rolling it on my motorbike.

Samuel
01:40:11
Where's that music even coming from? By the way, what what radio station would fucking play? Pruitt I go in like 2008. Who is playing that piece of it? I've never heard that piece of any Philip Glass I've heard on any radio station. Like yeah, Classic FM would never play Philip Glass, but Um I mean it's a and also I just don't think uh it it suits Nico Bellick so well, but it re I don't think it does suit Johnny Klebitz quite so well personally, but to each their own Matthew.

Matthew
01:40:40
I like uh the one song I do really like in this is um uh free ride which is uh dazed and confused as well and that's just uh that's like a classic isn't it? That's that's classic bike affair.

Samuel
01:40:53
Yeah that is good and um yeah it's Again, it's just that they're already it was already a pretty generous selection of music in the base game, so to go in and add like a bunch more was really good and people might never even appreciate the effort they went to to to put that in there because No one else is really doing that at the time with DLC. But I did want to spotlight my beloved Radio Vladimir stock here and to explain why I have so much affection for this radio station. Okay, so Radio Vladivostok was a a lot of like Eastern European music in the base game. And then for um the Ballad of Gaetoni, they went in and added a bunch of Club music presented by um DJ Paul, who is quite a cursed um individual, but he's like a British guy. Um a bit of the old energy of Danny Dyer in Vicity, I suppose. He was cool, but he's not right. He is, but he's not Kent Paul, he's just called DJ Paul. Yeah. Um and the reason I like this this bit of Radio Vadivostok is it All the music is from the same time period of 2004 or 2003-ish to 2004 or 5. And I my feeling is that um the people who decided that I think it's it would have been uh I think it's Craig Connor, um, the music uh like the audio director of the early GTA games who picked the music was Sam Howell, so I'm pretty sure that was what the process was. And um I'm pretty sure it would have been like a bunch of music that they were listening to in nightclubs in a particular window. And that window happens to coincide when I was 16, 17, 18 working in one-stop convenience store and all these pieces of music were playing on um Radio One. So there are bits of club music in this that like were were like real earworms from the time. And I feel like the I weirdly feel like a a piece of my Teenage life is immortalized in this one radio station because they all remind me of wearing that stupid red and black shirt and serving um Tories their newspapers and Alvastoke OneStop circa two thousand four and five. Why aren't you a GTA protagonist with that kind of story? Well the thing is but it's but it's also so British. Like the music they pick is so British. Like when You look at like what happened to the the the the music this in this game, like none of it charted in the US. So none of it has any US cultural footprint. DJ Paul is a British DJ in the game. So I suppose it's supposed to be, you know, oh, we've imported some music from over the pond that you might like, but it's all kind of club music. And I'm wondering if you remember any of the music on this, um, Matthew. Probably not, but Do you remember um Lola's theme? Do you remember that? It's like a number one hit in the UK. Kenny Hummet. Ah, but different person. And then there's like a bunch of club music. Do you remember? Yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah that was that was like a number one in two thousand four. So that's that's in here. Um do you know I don't know the names of any of them, but if you sing 'em for me I might know Oh my god, the stakes feel so high because I don't know what's going to come out of my mouth when I start singing. So it's like, um, do you know um the The Weekend by Michael Gray? I can wait for the weekend to begin. Do you know that one? No. Okay, fuck. Well, anyway, that was.

Matthew
01:44:04
Oh maybe. I s yeah, so yeah, maybe I do know that.

Samuel
01:44:08
Yeah, yeah. So it's uh and the the other one that I but the thing I the track that I think is amazing on this um is um Put Em High by Stonebridge, um who is one of I think one of these like Swedish musical geniuses who just knows what kind of like beats are gonna send your brain chemistry humming. So that track's amazing. I can't sing that one because No, the the singer Therese, her voice is um uh too high.

Matthew
01:44:33
Also she's got sort of like give us a blast.

Samuel
01:44:36
Come on, it's Patriot. No, um Uh Dance me a four pound fifty, monkey, dance. Um Uh It's sort of like uh no I can't because it's just she's got something uh buh buh bu Put 'em high. Push it high. That one's all struggling here. No, I told you I wasn't putting it. I appreciate you doing that. Oh, that was humiliating. Fucking hell. Is the money worth it? I asked myself. The answer is yes, it is. Um, especially when you're trying to get a house um purchase over the line. Um, yeah, there's also um Love on My Mind by the Freemasons. Do you know that one? Uh I might if I could hear it. Oh wait, it's sort uh no I'm not gonna do that one. This is uh it's I'm already I I feel like I've lost too much with the last uh the last one. Um Boogie Tonight is another really good one in here. Like I'm just I'm just name naming tracks now, but I wanted to basically just say that these were all huge like UK Radio 1 sort of like uh playlisted sort of dance anthems that were big in like two summers when I was a teenager. So I've got that's why I've got a lot of affection for this because it's so specific. It makes no real sense why it's in there, but it's in like one of the biggest video games of all time. Just putting so it felt kind of special to put something that particularly British in this. It's a bit like how In GTA 5 it has like scandalous by mystique when again there's no radio station in the US that was playing that in 2013. But they obviously just thought this is a cool British thing. We're a British studio, so this is like Our little tribute to our own musical culture, you know what I mean? So that's that is basically why I like in a long-winded way, Matthew, that's why I like Radio Vladivostok. So um No, I love that.

Matthew
01:46:24
I I think the Like the you know, what music will be in GTA 6 and what radio stations. That's like the you know, one of the five most exciting things about that game. You know, I c I can't wait to hear what they do and w what they've you know, landed on and what kind of culture they're trying to tap into this time.

Samuel
01:46:44
Yeah, it really is. Like it's um it's also that thing of like Uh you know, w uh uh because in um in GTA 5 it started to get fashionable enough that I was I was felt a little bit out of my depth with what they were picking. And so I'm curious how much they do music from the past because it's like Vice City. But also like they I did eventually catch up with some of the music in GTA 5. Like when they added like a Frank Ocean uh station I felt very sort of like old and out of my depth but then I got into Frank Ocean about a year later and I was like oh no I I can appreciate this and feel slightly less embarrassed but um Yeah, but when they added like dance music by all these DJs I'd never heard of in that DLC expansion for it, I was like, I don't know who the fuck the the black Madonna is. I've no idea who who who any of these people are. And I was like I f I swear they're just making these people up at this point, but anyway, so yeah. I'm curious too. Will it be too cool for me to appreciate? I'm sure there'll be plenty of um radio stations um tailored to oldies like you and me, Matthew. Um okay, so Like coming to the end here, I just had a couple more things to ask you, Matthew. Uh do you think it's a nice corrective to how depressing G24's ending is to have? Luis's ending here. Like i in general, do the DLCs like soften the blow of how sad the final act of GTA four really is?

Matthew
01:47:59
You you know that, you know, while you're blowing up a gangster in a plane and then having an awesome parachute ride. that Nico is somewhere else in that city having a really terrible time, like probably crying in his horrible little bedroom. So I don't think it like o you know, overwrites that or anything. I you know, I'm still aware of it, but it's it's Yeah, it's it's nice to end on this slight like the fact that it ends on like flying over the city, you know, basically ends with like an amazing shot of this huge city where you have presumably just spent three games playing. And that's you know, that's quite a nice sentiment of like, yeah, here we are. Goodbye. Goodbye to all this. Um so I yeah, I I r I really like that. I think it I think it's like very artfully done. But you know, particularly that final descent. And like the bit of music that plays is really nice as well. Um, you know, it's just a bit of orchestral not orchest like soundtrack rather than a particular song, I think.

Samuel
01:48:58
Yeah, I I I like that too. I think it's it is just nice to be like, oh yeah, there are other stories in this city and it isn't just like basically the tomb of Nico Bellick's life basically. It's just it's not like it's not it's not hell for him, you know, it's not the afterlife. It's like a lot of different stories play out here Side note, I really love that they um they show the thing that is uh that is talked about on the radio in GTA 4 of the homeless man who finds the diamonds that the um Oh the right from that mission that brings all the characters together, you just see see a shortcut scene where he finds them and y it's it's nice to just have some of these things like completed by the DLC. Um so that that kind of touch I like.

Matthew
01:49:38
What would be great is if on that final descent on the parachute, that's when Nico comes flying by, cro crawling up into the helicopter in his last mission. And by nice I mean that would be an awful way to win this game.

Samuel
01:49:53
That's when you see um But you can basically remember yourself just mashing a battery against the Xbox controller, trying to like clam into that fucking helicopter. Um and my last question, Matthew, was was it a shame GTA five never did similar DLC to this? And I asked this because I feel like there are so many features in the DLCs that were basically become GTA online features. Like the idea of the gang wars and stuff like that. That would all be a kind of like monetized elements of GTA Online there'd be like the economy would come into it. It would be a repeatable task. You know what I mean?

Matthew
01:50:28
Yeah, I I'm what I was going to ask, having read this, was, yeah, did you detect any taste of like potential story DLC in like the new online heists?

Samuel
01:50:39
The thing is, I think they like using a bit of the flavor of, you know, uh sort of GTA store single player to like you know, basically hand off some DLC tasks to you. And they very much felt like that to me. Like the nightclub stuff is introduced by Tony Prince in GT Online. And they recently brought Michael back into it as well. Um Michael looks like he had a rough time during COVID, if you ask me. The character model they've upgraded. It looks like he's just fucking read too much stuff on Reddit and it's just driven him completely insane. That's the vibe I got from the bits of Michael I saw. There's dreadful family in it too. There's um like Lamar turns up in one of the DLCs. Brilliant Lamar who we all agree is hilarious. I see it as slightly disingenuous window dressing for boring stuff. Like because it sort of tantalises you with what could have been. And then doesn't give it to you. It's sort of a bit like, you know, in Camp Krusty when um that episode of The Simpsons when like they all see the video and he's like, I'm off to Wimbledon, but I'll see you kids in a few weeks. That's what it feels like when Michael turns up at the start of a GTA DLC, online DLC. You're like, I'm just here to really introduce a task, but um they paid me my appearance fee and now I'm disappearing. It feels like that. And I think that That's what's kind of a a bit bitter about it. I'm not I wasn't really GT5 in particular, I wasn't dying for more of that game per se. I think it's a pretty complete game. Um at least how I remember it. We'll see when we replay it. But It is just that thing of like, it would be cool to see what some new rockstar single player would have looked like four or five years hence, you know?

Matthew
01:52:12
Oh yeah, absolutely. Um yeah, I I I I was always super impressed by what I saw of GTA Online with all that character work and the extra stuff. I you know I always wondered like, you know, did they actually do enough in GTA Online that they could have feasibly have built a single player DLC out of it. They just chose to deliver it in a slightly different mode of play or you know it sounds like it's not quite as far along as that, that it's a bit more like very cool set dressing. Um

Samuel
01:52:41
You know, but the heights the heist are the closest. Like the heist are like they are basically like the heist as they are in the single player game, but with four people participating in them. They are they are amazing, Matthew, I will say that.

Matthew
01:52:54
Yeah. I sort of it's a bit bit of a gaming regret, but I was just I just can't face it, you know.

Samuel
01:53:00
Why do why do you th why do you say that? Because we could just We could get Jeremy Peel involved. We could I'm sure we could find one other person who would join us. But don't you have but I thought this don't you have to like level up and get your character prepped and A tiny a tiny bit, but not much.

Matthew
01:53:13
Okay. Do you really uh do you ever play any GT online? Do you ever play any of it? Uh like the uh the tiniest amount, like you know, to get some capture here and there. Um I just I just remember it as just a mess of loading screens and misery.

Samuel
01:53:29
Oh yeah, but they've up they've sorted that out these days because it's um because it's on, you know, PS five and stuff. I don't know if that's it's completely sorted out, but it was last time I checked it was way faster than it was.

Matthew
01:53:40
Yeah, a little bit of the GTA story I would I would like to experience, but You know, to t to answer the original question, I I've I I felt similar to you. I kinda had you know, it's a massive GTA game, GTA five. And they really explore the lives of each of those characters and all the side activities and just how fleshed out it is. And you know, I think you could comfortably spend a hundred hours playing that single player stuff and feel like Not that the world was exhausted that you'd that you'd had your fill of it, so I'm kinda fine with it. You know, it's just not not who they are now, is it?

Samuel
01:54:15
No, it's sort of like and I don't really have any concerns that GTA 6 will feel like hobnobbed because they've got to invest in online. I'm sure that'll feel like uh self-contained kind of masterpiece. Like it's In general, I think it makes sense here because GTA 4, once it's done, as we discussed, it's just done really. There's not loads to go and do. And so there was there was more Yeah. to be to be done with that location and um more features to be added. And so in that way I think the DLC is super valuable Um yeah, and it's uh also like there is no way to show you another perspective of GTA V in the way they try to do here because you've already got it in the game. So Yeah, it's it's not uh it's not an easy solution to it, you know.

Matthew
01:54:57
Here's here's a question. They would never do this, so it's probably redundant asking it, but if they said At some point in the future, we're gonna go to GTA 4 and we're gonna like we're gonna inc we're gonna incorporate the DLC into it. We're gonna make it like a big coherent campaign with like three characters a la GTA five. Would you go for that or would that just be mad nonsense?

Samuel
01:55:21
Well part of me does wonder if the next next GTA, which will come out when we're both fifty two years old probably, um which is a depressing thought. Yeah, probably older, 'cause let's think, it was so it's gonna have been thirteen years.

Matthew
01:55:35
I'll be fifty-five at least when the next GTA comes out, GTA seven comes out. Oh, I mean it's quite I might not even make it to GTS.

Samuel
01:55:46
There's quite a real possibility you'll be 54 and I'll be 51. Oh fuck, I f but I played the first DTA when I was like 10. That's really depressing. Oh god. That makes me want to die. Um I but I do think they'll probably come back around to GTA um for Liberty C doing Liberty City again and surrounding New York because you could just do those boroughs. You could do like Wherever like whatever Don Draper's going past when he gets on the trains, the suburbs mapping you just stick that in there. Um yeah, I I think at some point you will see it. It was also rumoured that they were gonna do it as GT4 DLC, uh GT online DLC at some point. Because someone put on LinkedIn, oh yeah, I've been working on upgrading the modelling for like um uh central um for middle park in the game. Right. And it was a clear like They'd clearly upbreads it from what GTA 4 was, so at some point they were doing something like that. Um so yeah, I think it I think something like that would be cool. In general, I think that I don't need the DLC for GTA quite so much. I think I just missed the world where the games came out a bit faster. I think that's what I really yearn for more than like seeing more single-player DLC. Does that answer your question?

Matthew
01:56:57
Yeah. Yeah, that makes yeah that makes that makes sense. I'd I'd I honestly after they've done finish this sort of you know, not remake trilogy, but the second go around all these places, I'd I'd be up for them going somewhere new entirely. and seeing if there's there's something new to be done. You know, if if if there exists a place outside of Liberty City, Los Santos and Vice City Rockstar Games is going to Delaware. I can't wait to see it, Matthew. Um Well yeah, you never know. Maybe that person was up raising the park because you go there in a mission in GTA six.

Samuel
01:57:31
Well that's it. Well there are plenty of other um that's th I mean that is possible. That would be quite a flex. I mean San Andres did the classic, you know, you went back to Liberty City, sort of. So I couldn't believe how 'cause I'd never seen that mission before we played. San Andreas again. I couldn't believe how limited that was when they did it. Yeah. I was like, I'm trapped in one building in St. Mark's and there are no vehicles going by outside. This is like Basically feels like you're in a test level, you know.

Matthew
01:57:59
Um I do actually not not to get too sidetrapped by this, but playing these games and Seeing what they've done with the second trilogy in relation to what those games were like in the first trilogy, it does strike me that like Liberty City's the most uh GTA 4 is like the most paired back. and it's revisiting the game which because it was the first three was also paired back and then five uh does a sort of San Andreas maximalist thing again and like really mimics like how wild and like this countryside and there's plains and all this kind of stuff, all the mad stuff he did in San Andreas. I do wonder if If there is a th thematic backbone to this and they will like try and address that like the empire building and the business of the original Vice City in the new Vice City Yeah, I could see that. Like whether that there is actually more connective tissue between these pairings of games than they've actually ever said there was.

Samuel
01:58:55
Yeah, I mean I will be honest and say that I think a lot of my affection for GTA four is that it was the GTA 3 setting again. And it was my favourite GTA for a long time and you know the and it yeah, it was like going back to that, but also just, I don't know. But it was like the beyond your wildest dreams version of uh of a New York sort of pastiche. And yeah, I I like the idea of that as well. Like it's you almost wonder If if that probably was the original intent at some point, but have so many years passed now and so much work gone into it that no one even remembers

Matthew
01:59:28
the reason b behind why they did the settings in that order to begin with.

Samuel
01:59:32
You know what I mean?

Matthew
01:59:32
Like it's you think actually the the expectation now is that six is going to be even more maximalist than five. Which isn't true of like where Vice City sits in the original trilogy at all, but there are certain I keep seeing this fucking thing doing the rounds of like this This picture of the map of GTA 6, which I is definitely AI generated. And it's like five times bigger than GTA 5. It won't be. It just can't be I don't know. It shouldn't be.

Samuel
02:00:00
It shouldn't be. It could be it it should be the same size with more stuff on it. That's what I think it should be. Or like but also but also not the same like same size but a different shape. That's how that's how the map should be, basically. Like in and that's I think that's roughly what it will be. Different shape. more stuff on its similar size I expect because we have surely the lesson we should all learn from the last few years of video games is that bigger does not equals better necessarily. Like it's yeah it's unless it's the two giant men. Yeah, the larger we get, the more powerful we get, Matthew. Um okay, so I very much enjoyed revisiting these DLCs, Matthew. I do think that My advice to people who are maybe thinking about doing a replay off the back of these episodes is do put some space between doing GTA 4 and the DLCs. Like I think that they they benefit from having a bit of breathing room, you know? And I do think actually they they help you appreciate some of what GT4 did a little bit more. Like um like Matthew says, I think the the four a sh acts four and five arc of it, it does feel like they are they live to compliment it as much as anything. And um yeah, it's just reminds you of such a great era of Rockstar where they pumped out so much awesome stuff. Um and yeah, this This DLC was just part of that legendary run of games I mentioned earlier. So um yeah. Okay, Matthew, where can people get you on actually we don't need to do that as an extra episode, isn't it? It's done. Then the episode's over. And the XXL episode this month, what was it again? Best picture. Yeah, and our alternate um uh big um two giant men Oscars um will be providing that information to you as well for your delight so um yes please look forward to that Matthew let's get out of here goodbye goodbye
