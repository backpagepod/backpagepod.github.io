Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Recording a podcast on a Thursday, Matthew. Why did it have to be recording a podcast on a Thursday?
You shit.
Okay, so for context, myself and Matthew just recorded a very, like an intro that we had to get rid of because Matthew's mic wasn't working, and he started again. And my intro was so shit. I said to Matthew, Indiana Jones and the great, no, it's Matthew Castle and the Great Circle of Sweet Treats.
Is that your Saturday afternoon? It was so bad. And then Matthew countered with the joke I just made there about recording on a Thursday.
And he's right to call me a shit because I was so happy we could fucking get rid of that original recording because I thought-
You see, I liked it because it made me look good.
It did. And now, but you know, I've sort of like retconned in the sort of truth here. So it all balances out again.
You know, I could hum the Indiana Jones theme tune, but I will spare you that terror. So you know what it sounds like. John Williams, what are the greats?
So let's- Yeah, I'll say. He's no Danny Elfman though, is he Matthew?
Do you have a sort of like ranking there? Does Elfman, Trump, Williams, what's the sort of Matthew Castle take on that?
You want me to list just two musicians in the top two?
You can chuck Hans Zimmer in there if you want and Harry Gregson Williams.
I'm not a big Hans Zimmer guy.
No, I didn't think you were.
Save that one for spicy takes. No, it's got to be John Williams above Danny Elfman. Danny Elfman is a bit of a cursed character now, isn't he?
I mean, there's a bit of discussion like that. I feel like that's one of the sort of cancellations that people decided not to proceed with. Like he went into an in-tray and like Johnny Depp got stamped, you know.
Kevin Spacey got stamped. Danny Elfman was like returned to sender, you know, so we haven't got capacity for this cancellation, so it's sort of like out there in limbo. Did he do the music for the last, what's it film?
The, what's it called? Bamboozle Thingamajig. That lad in the black and white suit.
Fuck me, podcast is the perfect... Beetlejuice. That's it.
Bamboozle Thingamajig.
It's going well. It's going well, but I think he did the music for that, didn't he? So I think he came back.
Yeah, he did.
So it's not like he was really cancelled anyway. So Matthew has deemed William superior to Elfman and the podcast can proceed. Why are we doing this episode now?
So Indiana Jones and the Great Circle came out at the end of last year. It was number two in Matthew's top games of last year. And we talked about it a bit, but not in massive detail for reasons I won't bore people with.
They kind of know what the deal is, I think, by now. So we thought we'd revisit it because it came out on PS5 relatively recently. So more people have had a chance to play it.
Obviously, it's on Xbox and PC via Game Pass 2 and Steam. So lots of ways to play it by now. And we thought it would be good to do an episode where we talk all about the game, but also go into some of the spoiler-y specifics.
And I guess maybe sort of think of it as a bit of a sequel episode, Matthew, to our episode ranking all the Indiana Jones things that we did on the XL tier about two years ago. I think we did everything but this, which I already asked you about and you called it, I think you put it in the A rank just below Last Crusade and Raiders, which I think I agree with. And then I don't know if we did Dial of Destiny, but I think that's probably a C for me, Dial of Destiny.
What about you?
Yeah, probably a C.
I think that's what we ultimately decided on for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as well. And they're probably about as good as each other. So, you know, I think that probably works.
So yeah, so you have a non-spoilery first section in this episode and then a spoilery section in the second half where we'll talk more about the story, the MacGuffin, that kind of stuff. So yeah, gonna get deeper into the game that we've got before, I've just finished it for the first time literally this morning that we're recording this. You know, lots to dig into.
I've replayed a little bit and I sort of went into the maps and mopped up a few bits. I haven't done a full replay, I should say. So if I say anything, which sounds really wide in the mark, or I start talking about a location that isn't in the game, that's what's going on there.
Yeah, the middle section was a real tough hang, wasn't it, Matthew? So glad. Why did they even include that?
Oh, stupid MachineGames. So yeah, I've been playing it pretty recently, but obviously it only came out six months ago. I don't think Matthew's memory is that bad, but who knows?
You make it sound dicey these days. I don't know the games that have released in previous years are dead to you, Matthew, as you start racking up the big hitters for the 2025's end of year episode. You're like, no more Indiana Jones, I've got more of 100 Lion Academy to get through.
How's that going, by the way? I haven't really checked in for a while on how that one.
It's stalled a little bit since I got the Switch 2. Obviously, we'll work on the Switch 2. I just played so much of it for a while that I needed a break because it could be 100 hours long, it could be 200 hours.
People seem to take vastly different speeds through this game. So I just needed a little bit of distance. I can't just play one visual novel solidly for two months.
I think I'll go mad. And it's structured so that I can dip back into it. Yeah, I have played seven hours of Death Stranding 2.
Oh, nice. We're going to talk about that on next week's episode, aren't we?
Yeah, so that's coming.
Did you get to date everything in the end, Matthew? I've got a key for that as well.
When you said that, I was still thinking about Death Stranding 2. And you said, have you got to date everything? And I was like, with Death Stranding 2, is that a thing?
That's where my brain went. When like, well, I wouldn't put it past him, because you are in like a boat with a load of like Hollywood starlets. So maybe that's a thing.
But I have, I've played about an hour and a half of date everything.
Yeah.
Been playing it on my work PC at lunchtimes, which I think gets you some weird looks in the office, because you're basically trying to form romantic attachments to like a fricking washing machine or whatever. And it's not good for my office cred.
See, I thought it would be a great conversation starter for you in the office and you could delight them with the whole Matthew Castle experience. It's like, you know, now I'm going to explain this wacky game to you kind of situation. But clearly I've just not worked in the same office with you for a long time and have forgotten what that kind of experience is like.
But, you know, I think of you as like a jokester. I would have thought this game would give you some good material, but does it just make you look like a creeper? Is it not going well?
Yeah, I'd say it's got, and it's not like mega creepy, but it's got more creeper energy than jokester energy. These being the different character classes that my character can have.
Yeah, I was going to say, this big persona or even Minecraft energy to it.
I'd say it's more like it's character classes, job classes that are exclusive to my character in Yakuza Like a Dragon, the creeper and jokester.
Perfect. No notes on that. That sounds good.
Okay, so Indiana Jones and the Great Circle then. Look forward to discussion of those other games. Next week, I will also be playing rematch on Xbox Game Pass, Matthew.
I'll be pathetic at it and I will talk about being pathetic at it because I was always bad at football on the playground and I look forward to replicating that in a video game. So, indie, finally. First of all, Matthew, I thought it might be interesting to talk about what kind of game this is because MachineGames went with first-person adventure and I wondered if you agreed with that because to me, it feels like a relative of the Starbreeze games with its mix of hostile FPS style areas, but also like the non-combat hub areas with NPCs and big chunks of story.
But it also feels pleasantly like a game they figured out as they went because to me, it never feels like one part of the game actually takes over all other things. And so, I find it a little bit hard to categorise based on that. It is like the Indiana Jones-ness of it.
Kind of like, sort of, triumphs over traditional genre labels, if you know what I mean?
Yeah, I would agree with that. It's as if they broke down the Indiana Jones films into all their kind of constituent parts, and a few parts scream obvious video game compatibility. Exploring, solving puzzles, doing combat, whatever.
But then they have also zoomed in on the fact that Indiana Jones is also quite like a social creature, and a lot of the pleasure of those films is spending time with other characters. Things that you would not traditionally just put in a cut scene, but I think they found lots of interesting ways of drawing out those non-action story beats as well. So, you know, while it is hard to go like, you know, it's this or that, it's a pretty good Indiana Jones simulation.
Like that's kind of the genre. You know, everything Indiana Jones can do or would do, you will do in this game. Which in a way, if you think back to like Riddick, it's kind of what they did for him as well.
Like obviously there was less sort of bants with Riddick, because I think he's a character who's had like ten lines in all films. But you know, they're just very good at kind of drilling in, drilling into it, which is kind of an interesting process. Because if you think like Uncharted famously went to like all these sort of pulp adventure films like Indiana Jones and broke them down and went, you know, our game's got to be all this stuff.
But they, you know, only arguably focus more on the action side of the things. You know, there's not many purely like social areas or that kind of more laid back kind of getting used to being in a new country or whatever, which is quite key here, which I think is great. I mean, it's really distinct.
Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting old thing, because I was thinking as I played it, the ready thing kept coming back to mind, but in general, I was like, this has got a lot of PC DNA, this game, you know. It feels so early noughties PC in a good way, but every now and then, the navigation of the environments and stuff like that just reminds me of playing games from that period. It just feels like a strand of game design that has been abandoned, I guess.
Sort of the narrative heavy, but increasingly high production value first person game. So I'm thinking things like Fear and Condemned as well, where…
Yeah, I mean, I was going to say, like, No One Lives Forever 2, there's quite a lot of that in this. Kind of character, stealth, action. It's like, not full immersive sim, but enough freedom of approach that you can maybe get that vibe off it, which is also interesting.
Did you ever read, Jeremy did a good piece about Indiana Jones and immersive sims?
I think I did read this. Was this on? Actually, no.
Yeah.
It was in Eurogame, I think. And he basically put it to, I mean, maybe it came up in his edge piece as well, but he put it to, like, the creative director or the main gameplay designer, that it was a bit immersive simmy, and they quite resisted that. I think he said they winced at the suggestion, probably because it, like, spells death for so many games that kind of really lean in to that identity.
You know, and then the rest of the article is about how, actually, it has a bit more kind of, like, easygoing sort of flow to it, and failure is sort of folded into its design a bit more than it is in an immersive sim perhaps.
Yeah, that's very much...
It's many things.
It really is, and that's very much true. It is, like, you know, like we were talking about, the Indiana Jones-ness is kind of what triumphs here. And so, yeah, I think they were absolutely right to resist the term immersive sim, not just because it has all this baggage, you know, and is kind of renowned as the genre that never sells well, but also is, you know, it's just, it's a bit more slapsticky than your typical immersive sim.
And it's not really a game that, where there's like such a ceiling to the ways in which you can play it, that the description would be accurate. It's basically a game where you try your best to stealthy your way through environments, but then much like the Indiana Jones in the films, things go wrong and you have to start picking up objects and like having fistfights with dudes who are much bigger than you. And that's like one of the ways in which it's very authentic is an Indiana Jones experience, you know?
So, yeah, so that's really interesting about it. Sometimes every now and then, the game does try and be uncharted a bit, I would say. It's sort of like, I would say it doesn't have the incredibly rigorous narrative polish of Naughty Dog's games.
But like, what I mean by that is in terms of every little character animation frame being just so, where it's like, it's that kind of thing that they are like very well known for. Here, you're seeing everything in first person, so it's much more like everything's under a microscope anyway, with how you're playing the game. But it's sort of like, it's not quite, you know, it's a very polished game, but it's like not quite as polished as that, in terms of that narrative storytelling side of things.
But I was curious to know what you made on the whole about when the game, which is this mix of like, hub levels that you explore and do narrative missions within them, then some straight narrative missions in more linear locations. Whether it does succeed at trying to be uncharted for a bit.
More in those linear sections, you mean?
Well, I guess, I guess in general, like also the story missions within the actual hub environments. I'm just curious, more generally, do you think it ever gets close to being that sort of thing? Does it ever pull it off?
I mean, there are a couple of set pieces in the middle, which feel more like an uncharted set piece than an Indiana Jones set piece, in terms of their, sort of, not the scale, but like concept. You know, they're quite big, video gamey moments. Maybe we'll get to more in the spoilery part, but like what happens in the Himalayas and immediately after it, I think are scenes that if you did them in an Indiana Jones film, I think we'd be probably sneering at that a little bit, or there'd be, there's such an unreality to them, in terms of like the mechanics of what's going on, but in a video game, they make perfect sense.
You can get away with different things in a video game. So those bits are quite successful. Definitely in terms of like valuing back and forth conversation, like this is often a game where someone is at your side, whether that's your sidekick Gina for a lot of the game, but then the side quests often have these little characters and they come in and they leave quite an impression.
That to me feels key. Part of the Naughty Dog's whole deal, uncharted and otherwise, is kind of the illusion of an AI companion who you're good mates with. Like good hangs and sort of having fun on little quests.
That's probably like the most uncharted bit of this for me. I'd say it's definitely, it feels like it's a bit more committed to the, you know, if you want to do this all stealth, you can do this all stealth, where I think uncharted is a bit more prescriptive and this doesn't really want to do that.
Yeah, even in uncharted 4 where you could stealth certain sections of the game, it's sort of like a bit non-committal as a stealth game, isn't it? It's a bit like, well, you can do this until it goes wrong.
Yeah, which is probably how I would categorize MachineGames stealth in their previous games, like their attempts at stealth. It's like you can bump a couple of people off, but inevitably this isn't made to be done like this. Where Indiana Jones, I mean, it's a game where I was trying to wrap my brains for what the guns were actually like.
Like, how many bullets did I actually fire in this game? Like, did I fire six in the whole campaign? I'm not sure.
You know, it really does let you either go in quiet or go in with hammers, which is the middle ground between quiet and guns, I guess.
Yeah, lots of fun moments in this game of just like twatting someone with an object that you found, whether it's a guitar or, yeah, like a bottle or a hammer. Just in so many frying pans, so many different things. And again, that adds to the sort of slapstick Indiana Jones charm of it.
I agree. When you fire a gun in this game, you don't really know if it's deliberately meant to feel off or not. My guess is that it is.
But when you fire it, it's meant to feel like, oh, it's not quite right that I'm doing this. I'm not quite a guy who does this all the time, you know? So I wonder if that is like the intent of it, because yeah, you do sort of like fire a couple of shots and then sort of like chuck it and keep moving.
And often, it's more useful to turn the gun around and use it as a melee weapon. That ends up being sometimes like a better sort of solution. Maybe it's just because they thought, well, you know, unlike Indiana, unlike Nathan Drake, Indiana Jones doesn't really go around like killing loads of people.
Definitely kills some people in those films, but I don't think he like, he wants to necessarily and certainly doesn't get joy out of doing it. You know what I mean? I think most of the casualties are because of like, like truck crashes and things like that, or him kicking a guy off of a thing as opposed to like, gunning a guy down and going ha ha ha ha.
You know what I mean? There's none of that really in those films.
Yeah, it's kind of like, it's more of a, well I warned you not to do that.
It's interesting in that respect because there's a bit of a like tension between what Indiana Jones is and what, you know, MachineGames is best known for, which is first person shooters where you very bloodily, you know, gun down Nazis. That's what the games are. So there's some shared DNA in the sense of Indiana Jones is a guy who takes on Nazis, but they're not exactly, he's definitely not BJ Blazkowicz.
There's a very different sort of paradigm. So the game suits that, I would say. So Matthew, I thought we could talk about the different areas one by one, because the hub areas rather, because they define the tone of the game to a large extent.
They are the locations you spend the most time in. The first two hubs, the Vatican and Giza, the Pyramids and Egypt, those basically make up the first half of the game. And then there's one more hub area, Sukhothai, that's in the second half of the game.
So they are basically, I think, the marquee locations of the game. They're the ones I think you think about the most once the game is over as well. They have side content in them as well as these kind of narrative bits and pieces.
So let's start with the Vatican, because it's really interesting to me, and I don't know if you agree with this, I thought this is the least Indiana Jones like location in the game, but it's been the most celebrated, and I do think it's creatively very successful. But what did you make of it?
I don't know. I don't know if I agree that it doesn't feel Indiana Jonesy, because maybe I'm specifically thinking of the Venice scene in Last Crusade, but the idea of him being in an historic city and smashing through an old building that's a bit of a tourist attraction to get to some dark secret underneath. That does feel like quite a well-observed ingredient in Indiana Jones.
It's not in every film. It's a bit of a Last Crusade thing. There's a bit in Dial of Destiny where they go to that kind of tomb.
They go to like a tourist attraction tomb and then they do some stuff with water and yeah, it didn't really leave a huge impact on me. There is definitely some tourist attraction becomes a different thing in Dial of Destiny. So I don't know that that and it's a place where like Indiana Jones can show off maybe his more like academic side, which is a good fit.
Also just like meeting Nazis in a more polite environment, you know, where they're a threat, but it's not like you get the idea that in some of these places, like in the middle of the desert or in a deep jungle, they can sort of do whatever they want. While they're kind of a slightly better behaved around the Vatican. And there's this sort of...
It paints a good picture of the time, which some of the Indiana Jones films do. Like just there are loads of Nazis about, and sometimes that might turn into something and sometimes it won't. But are they like, you know, the cornerstone of Indiana Jones?
Maybe not, but they're quite important parts of it to me. Okay, so the Latticum for that reason really works. And it is like, it's just a great urban environment, you know, like if this was a Hitman level, which I know is a bit of a cliché, you know, people have said that about this game, but you know, the way it all interconnects and the way that you kind of gradually command it with, you know, unlockable costumes, I think it really does hold up as that kind of social stealth space, you know, which for their sort of first go at that or on this kind of scale, is pretty amazing that they got it right.
Not many other people do try that, you know?
Yeah, absolutely. It's quite different to anything they've made before. And to be clear, it's not, you know, that's not me saying it's not necessarily authentically Indiana Jones.
It's just maybe a bit less obvious a piece of iconography, less obvious a location. You know, if you think of something like Giza, I think there's a very obvious parallel to that in Radius, for example. Or Sukhothai is a very obvious parallel to that in, I guess, like maybe a bit of Temple of Doom and a bit of, maybe there's a bit of Dial of Destiny in that as well.
Yeah, I mean, Crystal Skull had a fair amount of jungle and boats.
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, but that's actually what I like about the game is it takes its bolder swing first in terms of the environment that it gives you.
Because like you say, it's almost the most significant in terms of the role that you play within that environment because you do go in with like a priest outfit, and you are regarded as such by loads of NPCs. I think it's the most you think about the costume that Indy's wearing as he's going around this space. And there are loads and loads of fun sidequests in there, like little secrets to discover, things like that.
It's a perfect environment for that sort of thing. And yeah, I'm very fond of it as well. And I could see why people lost hours and hours in it.
I think it's, for whatever reason, the location I enjoyed doing the less sort of like story driven side content of the game, the mysteries in the game that you find, or the collectibles. It's maybe a bit... For whatever reason, I just found it a bit more of a compelling environment to spend time in for that reason, you know?
So yeah. Okay. Well, you know, Pyramids, Matthew, I'd love to hear what you think, because I think that's a pretty amazing spectacle.
You get to the end of the first act of this game, and indeed it travels on an airship from the Vatican to the desert. And then you get to see, yeah, just the pyramids in every direction with the wavy heat lines going on as well.
It's very, yeah. Wibbly wobbly, as made famous, as invented by Nintendo in Mario Sunshine. They invented the concept of heat haze.
Yeah, no, I really love Giza. I think it's, what's great about it is, the perfect, like, judgment in terms of, like, size, where it's big enough to feel, like, quite vast and, oh, there are all these things scattered across this map, but not so big that walking from one side to the other becomes, like, a huge chore. You know, there is a fast travel system with the signposts in this game, but I don't think I ever really engaged with that because I always felt like, well, there's probably something to do, or if I walk along this road I can kind of stick my head and nose into a couple of these tents along the way and see if there's a collectible.
So that I really liked. I'm a big fan of the kind of, like, the wide linear thing that everyone talks about with, you know, like, Metro Exodus sandboxes and, to an extent, the open world sections in Last of Us Part II and Uncharted 4. You know, it's kind of like the best of both worlds.
It's not like a proper, proper open world, but it's kind of like good enough. So I like it for that reason. And also, you know, this amazing Raiders of Lost Ark kind of tribute piece.
You know, you kind of, the kind of trouble you run into, you know, being used by the Nazis to kind of explore and excavate dangerous tombs that they're not able to or puzzles they've not been able to crack. You know, that feels very true to Raiders. I just, what I actually really like about Geyser is the, it has its own little like arc in terms of like arriving, meeting the villain, the way your relationship with the villain kind of changes through the level.
Just, it feels very like carefully structured as a whole. Which, you know, isn't always true of these games. Like sometimes it's just like, we've been to this location, tick it off.
But I think they have like specific things they set out to achieve here and then they do do those things.
Yeah, I think that's true. I like the idea as well of, like you say, it's this big Raiders tribute piece, but they wait to give it to you, you know? It's sort of like, I think it's emblematic of the game's approach to fan service more generally, is that it never cuts corners to give you those moments.
I guess you like might argue that rendering the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark in, you know, beautiful, you know, modern graphics is like an example of that. But that's almost like that's done to such a high standard that it's almost like you just can't really hold it against the game. It just it's just delightful, I think.
And and also reminds you much as that intro to that film gives you a little kind of bottled up version of who is this character and tells you everything about that character. This, you know, the intro performs the same function within this game. But after that, yeah, like I say, it's kind of you have a little while before you're presented with any really obvious fan service.
And then Giza is a bit of that, but it definitely doesn't feel like a reheat of those sections of Raiders. Like you say, it's got its own story going on. Something I find really interesting about the structure of this game is that it is divided into these main quests and fieldwork, which are basically your narrative side quests.
So there are some bits of story within them. They are sort of the essential side quests. Really, the game is kind of telling you that, I think.
And I actually, when I got to Giza, I realized I'd missed one of the main fieldwork quests in the Vatican. I went back and it's the quest where you and Gina, your sidekick in the game, are going up that tower and meeting.
Oh yeah, yeah.
And like, it's interesting because I feel like I broke the structure of the game a tiny bit because I'd already gone with Gina to the desert. But I feel like that instance between the characters is probably quite a key part of their relationship being built. You know, but.
Yeah.
Yeah, so I kind of learned my lesson from that.
So you're climbing up the tower and Gina keeps going, we'll never go to Giza together. We'll never ever go to Giza. And you're like, oh man, this is this really doesn't land as well anymore.
Just to be very clear, I hate Egypt and I will never change my mind.
Yeah.
So after that, I learned my lesson. I was like, right. Okay.
When I get to Giza, I'll do all the fieldwork before I move on to the next, next location. That's kind of interesting. But yeah, it does give you a bit of that Grand Indiana Jones feel of like exploring ruins, finding treasures.
This is when the game more regularly starts, including Gina as a sort of like sidekick character within the game, you know, like giving you bits of narrative. That's not true. She is in the Vatican as well, but comes into it in the second half, really.
Whereas here, she's sort of like more more of a constant. And then she's just sort of there throughout the rest of the game. Yeah, it's very, very cool.
And it's got a different flavor of temple and tomb and dungeon to the Vatican. The Vatican's got a lot of your Dan Brown religious iconography, conspiracy, all this stuff kind of above ground, kind of doubles up as something below. And I think that the Egyptian tombs just have a, you know, they're much kind of like bigger and grander.
You know, they feel like these like truly kind of like ancient death traps that have been built. You know, it's kind of hard to exactly put your finger on, but it feels like there were like different minds at work behind like different, you know, the architecture and the style of the kind of puzzles that are going to be each of these locations, which I think is, you know, quite well observed. It doesn't just feel like they've just reskinned them and put like sand in a load of Vatican dungeons, you know?
Oh yeah, so different. Like the layout is so different. It's a very good location for hiding secrets, you know?
I don't think, I think I find a lot of desert levels quite boring. When I see a desert, I'm like, oh god, here we go. You know, much more of an ice level guy myself, Matthew, or a volcano level.
It might be like a nice little mirage Easter egg or something. That's about the best you can hope for.
Yeah, here it's good because it gives you a bit of a fetch quest to start with, but that's good for orienting you in the environment. And then there's some quite fun stuff out there to discover. These sort of little clusters of Nazi bases and, you know, one bit that was shown in the trailers where Indy can sort of be disguised as a worker and then bring a drink to a table for the Nazis playing cards.
I think they are. You're stealing an artifact at the same time. Just, you know, like, good, just cool little moments to stumble across a bit.
We can electrocute a little lads. That's really good in this game.
So yeah, it's a train, a big ass train.
Yeah, that's true, actually. Yeah.
Thundering through the level. That's always exciting to see. A train.
It is cool. Yeah, it definitely gives it a bit of spectacle. It's a very spread out level, but you can also like fast travel.
Once you sort of figure out the fast travel system, then it's sort of like it solves that problem for you. But yeah, I thought Giza was also good, Matthew. I thought like the bit where it takes you, well, actually we'll come back to some of the moments of the game because I want to support everything.
Okay, so last open area is Succotie, like I say, I'm probably pronouncing that terribly. This seems to be the least liked area because of the boat breaking up. You need to use a boat to navigate between little islands.
I was curious what your thoughts are on this. It's a bit of a shorter section, I think, this bit.
Yeah, I thought, I think if you engage with all the side quests and the collecty things, you know, it's still pretty substantial, but I think the actual story here feels quite short. Like, you've only been here like an hour and then he does the classic, I should probably do all the side quests because I'm going to fuck off in a moment, or whatever it is he says. He doesn't put it in those terms, obviously.
And, yeah, I mean, people bang on about the boat, but I mean, it is a little slow, it is a little fussy. I think the problem with the boat and the fact that it's sort of set on the kind of river with lots of little islands is that if you are into the kind of completionist side of this game and collecting all the artifacts and trinkets, there's just a lot of ground to cover here. And you have to keep jumping in and out of this boat.
You kind of go over, there's lots of little islands which you've got like the same ten bush and tree models on, and you kind of walk through those, hoping to maybe discover something. Like, it's a little hazy about like, you know, exactly where you should go. I find like it was hard to get my bearings here.
Like it's the level I did. I never really had a good grasp of like where I was driving. I never had like certain routes that got me around it.
So I was constantly in the map. That said, I quite like like hanging out with Gina in the boat. I quite like she's there chatting away with you.
The side quests are pretty good. Like, you know, because they take you away from the river into these more kind of like sort of Aztec-y kind of flavoured tombs and, you know, that they're distinct vibe, which is which is good. I actually think my biggest criticism of Circus Eyes that it gives you like the costume that kind of unlocks it all quite early on.
Yeah, really early on. It doesn't really have the every other level has like almost like layers that you peel back as you get the costumes and you only kind of have proper run of the place like in your last third of your time in that level. But here there's like none of that.
So it all feels a little bit one note. Like you can just run around a lot of the Nazis quite early on. I mean, maybe they just don't want to have that same power arc over and over again of you get a costume, which is kind of helpful when in a costume.
It's really helpful. But then why have the costume system at all if you can just run circles around everyone? It's the only bit of it doesn't quite make sense to me.
Yeah, I get that. It's sort of when you said run circles, I should have said great circles, Matthew.
Great circles of sweet treats.
Fuck's sake. That's the, honestly, worst minute of podcasting ever recorded for one of these episodes. I'm including all the games, courts and mail bags and that, by the way.
I don't know. You haven't heard some of the intros I've done when you weren't there and I've had guests on it and the stuff I've deleted, because I just forgot how to, like the name of the podcast and terrible.
Do you really? I picture like Geraint sat there while you do like 12 takes of the intro.
Well, no, but it's just little things like, welcome to Back Page, a podcast about video games. And I'm like, no way. Is it a video games podcast?
It's a video game. Because I just never say them. I say hello.
Yeah, you do. That's true.
That's my job.
Yeah. I don't mind if you change that up, though. Every now and then I think about changing it up.
Well, with Geron, I recorded it separately. Because I didn't want him to hear how bad I was at the intro and then lose faith in the interview that was about to unfold. Right.
Like when I interviewed Stu Turton, there was a little bit of a... I felt like we had to kind of, like, regain sort of respect for... Well, he had to regain any kind of respect for me, like, over the first 10 minutes.
Where with Gerard, we were like straight in.
The funny thing was as well, I thought like, oh, this best-selling author is having the concept of Samuel Roberts explained to him or like referenced and I'm just like, this man deserves better than this. Do you know what I mean? Like if you write like books that are that good, then you shouldn't have to hear about me and my whole situation.
So yeah. But anyway, I thought you did a great job with those episodes, Matthew. So yeah, I think I'm going to be back to Sukhotha.
Yeah. So you're right. The cost, the way that the costumes are laid in in Giza and the Vatican is very elegant.
You do go from priest cosplay to basically Italian Nazi cosplay and black shirts as they were called. Back before the Nazis went. Sort of like, well, basically before, just before World War II started.
So yeah. And then in the desert, it's a similar thing. You get a worker costume and then you get a Nazi costume.
I think that's right, isn't it, Matthew? And then the last one is just an Nazi costume, but jungle version, you know, like when in Star Wars, the different Stormtroopers have a little like outfit when they're on Endor. It's a bit of that energy, really.
It's like you got a little colonial hat, you know, that denotes a racist man would wear this. A racist white man would wear this hat, basically. Big that bloke with a mustache in Tarzan energy.
Can't remember his name. So anyway, so yeah, there's, it's a cool army base in this open world, which I did like. And initially I was like, oh, I do quite like the sort of the change of location.
It is again, like we said, it feels like a very specific type of Indiana Jones, you know, sort of environment to explore, but there's just a bit too much. If you explore early, you might stumble across something you were meant to find later. And that happened to be twice where I was like, I treated it as, I'll just go and exploring in this boat and I'll get out.
And then only realize, why is nothing happening? Why is nothing activating here? And that's because you have to come back later when a big story moment happens and a hole is blown in the floor.
So you can actually go through and play the quest that's meant to be here. But it's that thing of like, yeah, because the game is not really a sandbox game in that fashion, it does want you to do things in a certain order, yet it has the kind of, you know, the structure of like a sandbox. And that makes it the weakest environment by default, and as well as the costume thing you mentioned.
I did like raiding Voss' army base though, because there's some cool, there's like two safes to raid there, and like some of the larger buildings to explore in the game, and the most concentrated areas of Nazis. But I agree that once you get that costume from that location, that's no longer a threat and you're quite smug about it, but then you spend the next like three or four hours, you know, with like no peril whatsoever when you enter an environment. So yeah, that's fair criticism, Matthew.
I did like some of the characters there though, and some of the quests stuff that we'll talk about in a bit. So let's talk broadly about the combat then. Not a huge amount of depth to it, but like we said captures the improvisational nature of Indiana Jones quite well.
I came around to thinking it was just right for the game, the combat overall, including the stealth. It's sort of like not terribly involved, but you sort of muddle through it and move on and it's not a huge deal. And every now and then you might have just enough mastery to it, that you might counter block a bunch of punches and like take out enemies quite easily.
You feel like, oh yeah, I did actually like do something here. I didn't just go down to one health and get absolutely clobbered or just firing constant machine guns and building up a big pile of bodies, which I did in the Vatican when things went wrong. That was embarrassing.
So, curiously, what you think, Matthew, of the combat and whether it works overall?
Yeah, I think it does, largely as a triumph of feedback, sound effects, ragdolling bodies, that kind of stuff. It's fundamentally very funny to punch people and send them reeling, or they then trip over a chair. Or they've really nailed the kind of art of someone who's been knocked out, but has got like five seconds of life in them, and can kind of like stumble on the spot before falling over, like make you kind of second-guess yourself, which is just really, really good comic brawling stuff.
It's a way that I feel like you have way more moves in combat than you ever really need. Like, you know, you've got to push, and you can do some stuff with the whip to kind of pull people in, and you know, the fact that you've got like two fists and can kind of combo them in different ways. But I did find like, basically like, you know, parry or, you know, counter punch or whatever, and then punch basically got me through like the whole thing.
You know, I didn't feel like there was a deeper layer to kind of connect to. I didn't think people could kind of come at you with enough variety of, you know, attacks and tactics that you need all these different moves. You know, I'd be interested to see like enemy types that maybe almost had to be like unlocked or, you know, almost like a little combat puzzle to solve with these different moves.
A bit of punch out maybe in the mix is what I want. You know, like fake out here and then it opens them up here and that's the kind of instant takeout. But as it is, very funny watching people stumble over their own chairs and fall out of bang into walls and pipes and whatever.
And likewise with the stealth, it's like incredibly like OneNote getting items and manipulating the quite simple AI of the characters. But the range of items that you smack people with is so good and the falling over animations are so funny that even though I saw them like 200 times or whatever in the course of this game, I wasn't ever bored of that. The joy of stealth is more like one of role playing, where you kind of look around the environment and it's not kind of like what's the tactically smartest thing to do to this Nazi.
It's what's like the funniest thing here to hit them with. Or I very much feel like Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction, where he keeps putting down their weapons in the pawn shop because he sees something a bit better. And he's like, no, no, not this, this, or not the base, but, oh yeah, the samurai sword or whatever.
That'll do it. You know, I had lots of things. It's like, oh, not a hammer.
Let's hit them with this baton. Oh no, actually, it's a frying pan. Let's use that.
That's quite a good little bit of power fantasy. You know, if you want to hit a Nazi with a sort of 1940s domestic appliance, it's probably in this game somewhere.
Yeah. Yeah, I like that about it as well. I think it's, when I was, the punch out thing you mentioned is interesting.
So I sort of see how a bit of maybe an Arcadia approach might actually work there. Because it does, the counterpunching does almost border on punch out anyway sometimes, you know, just in terms of how obvious the punches are. I was there struggling actually to think of what would I do with this combat system?
If I could add a load of depth to it, what exactly would I do? And I did struggle a little bit. Like I might do even more precise kind of like whip interactions.
Like you can do one where you like whip them on the foot and then like pull them over. That's good. Whipping them to make them drop weapons.
That's good as well. Like that works. But I don't, unless you make it really physics-y, I don't know if that would add loads of value to it.
I don't think that the Indiana Jones character makes sense if you did like a really complex like Sifu or From Software style counter, you know what I mean? Like that sort of thing is not really Indiana Jones either. So it's quite hard.
I think what they came up with is probably them compromising between what they think is a good combat system and what Indiana Jones authentically does in those movies, you know?
Yes, it's kind of as your digital Indiana Jones is as good at combat as real Indiana Jones. You know, if he's any better than that, then he's not really Indiana Jones anymore. That is a problem.
So, yeah, keeping it kind of rough and ready. Also, I think if you are constantly getting like mulched in fistfights in this game and you weren't like scraping through with some mad hijinks, it also wouldn't feel like Indiana Jones, you know? Fucking up and getting pulled into chaos and then somehow getting out by like a random combination of fists and props.
Like that's as Indiana Jones as it comes. I'll tell you what I would have liked a little bit more of. There's not a lot of like big environmental interactions, which, you know, in the films, there's always at least one juicy set piece where there's like the guy who's like twice the size of Indiana Jones and he sort of punches him in the stomach and then the guy sort of like flexes and laughs.
And the only way Indiana Jones kills that guy is by like pushing him through plane propellers or putting him in a rock crushing machine. It's like this is beyond a man to kill this man, so it has to be done with a machine. There isn't a lot of machine death in this game.
That is true actually. Not many of them reach really horrible ends. About as horrible as it gets is you might push someone to their death from a cliff or something.
That is part, you know, Indiana Jones gets away with a lot in like a PG rated film of like comedy blood smears on the conveyor belt in Temple of Doom. Like you want to have some stuff where you're like, eww, when it happens. And that doesn't really happen in this ever.
Yeah, you're right actually, that would have been good. If like the big dude, that you, there's like a big enemy in the game, like a dumb sort of fairly senior Nazi officer guy who you deal with. If he'd have met like a bloody end, like he got cut in half or something in the Himalayas, that might have been quite fun.
But yeah, I agree. It does lack a little bit of that. So if they do ever make a sequel, that could be on the wishlist for sure.
It's just like-
They've got to have that in their back pocket though. Let's not do that this time. We've got to have something, you know, we need to have a bullet point for the press release next time.
And like, feeding Nazis into industrial machinery, that's a very easy win.
Exactly. Just, yeah, suddenly an 18 rated. You're rated 18 for 100 threshing machinery related deaths, basically.
Just a very quick side note. I've started watching this Korean game show called A Physical 100, which is trying to find what is the best body physique of like this huge, like everyone's sort of a bodybuilder. Everyone's got like a like massive muscles, but some of them are like wrestlers, some MMA people, some of them are gym addicts, pure bodybuilders, and they make them do all these physical tasks.
But every single person in that show looks like the kind of person in Indiana Jones would have to kill with a machine. They just have that energy. Like all of them are just like absolute monsters.
And occasionally one of the small monsters, or smaller monsters will have to face off against like one of the really big monsters. And that's got big like Indiana Jones energy. I recommend that a MachineGames watch Physical 100 and use that as inspiration of like, what can happen to big bodies in fights?
That's a great recommendation. Do you think any other bit of coverage around Indiana Jones, the Great Circle is mentioned, Physical 100, Matthew? Like you've got to be the first and only surely.
That's amazing. What could happen to big bodies? That's so good.
Okay. Yeah, I think that's a good, those are good notes actually. I hadn't really thought about those things.
Yeah, I think it's definitely like a tough one. I can see why they didn't do sort of stances like in Jedi Survivor, where it's like heavy Indiana Jones, and he's got all like double whip Indiana Jones, or something ridiculous like that. You can't really do the Cal Kestis thing with Indiana Jones.
He's just one guy basically. So yeah, I'm glad that I've used you though.
I just thought that's the idea that like the big gameplay development in like the third act is that he realizes he could have been carrying two whips this whole time.
Yeah, that seems fraught, doesn't it, to do that. Okay, let's talk about the com... Oh, not the combat, Matthew.
Let's talk about the puzzles instead. So I was wondering as someone who has a bit more experience with that point and click side of Indiana Jones, as in, you know, the Last Crusade and also the Fate of Atlantis, what you thought of the puzzles in this game? Because I do think that they are...
Well, actually, I want to hear what you think about them because I keep prefacing all these points with what I think and I want to create a bit of conversation first. So I'm going to hear what you think first.
Yeah, I never want to change my opinion to some dirty feelings. So yeah, that is the danger of this. Yeah, I think there are like two tiers.
I think there are puzzles on like the main storyline, which are all quite simple, but like quite spectacular. And I can't really see many people getting stuck on them, but they are, they're, they're fun from a wish fulfillment perspective of like you get to use weird props, like tipping the wine down the, the kind of fonts in the Vatican, and powering up great big pieces of machinery in various dungeons and temples. There's nothing where I was, you know, I ever had to use like the hint system to kind of give me kind of guidance, but they look cool.
And, you know, I liked the, the kind of the sense of like the theatrical around them. But then, you know, it also has this tier of like side quest mysteries. I think they're literally called mysteries, which are almost like the kind of sort of brain teasers sort of dotted around the map that often are like a logical puzzle or like a maths conundrum or a bit of code breaking.
And you have to use like, you know, a couple of props in a particular location to work out how to access someone's safe. And they're more like little kind of Sherlock Holmes-y adventure games puzzles or even like Professor Layton puzzles. Like can you use this code book to crack this weird message or whatever?
And that stuff like, it's not like, you know, rocket science, but it's a little bit cheerier, thus optional. But I quite like both of those things. I felt like, you know, you never came, you didn't come out of this feeling like, you know, you were some like giant brain genius for solving these.
But you, I think it honours the fact that he is like a thinker as well as a puncher, and that's kind of what I wanted.
Yeah, I think that's, I think that's right. It's sort of like, it feels like it had a slightly higher quantity of, you know, genuine puzzles, you know, more so than the Uncharted games do, where the puzzles are not particularly memorable. But sometimes the scale of them is spectacular, but like the solution is often quite easy.
This is not much harder than that, but it's like just stimulating enough at times, that you're like, oh, what's a genuine puzzle someone thought about?
There'll be like four in a row in like one of the big story dungeons, or like three huge rooms, each with an interesting puzzle, which then combines something in the middle. You know, it feels more like what Tomb Raider does. It's like unembarrassed for half an hour of the game to be just puzzle solving, which most games are like, oh no, if there's a puzzle, then there's got to be a fight, or there's got to be a stealth moment.
We can't possibly put two puzzles next to each other, which is very much like uncharted steel. But yeah, here, absolutely. And it's great.
Like I love the one that kind of concludes the Vatican, when you kind of go into that fountain, and then there's like, is it like a big furnace you're powering up under there? Just feels really exciting, like you're making something happen.
Yeah, that was one of my highlights of the game actually, when you, the fountain puzzle, and then the kind of how it develops now. It's like, oh, this is like where you really get the hidden layers within the level itself. And there's like an actual spectacle to the puzzle side of it.
And yeah, it's super successful at doing that. And yeah, like you say, it's committed to its own logic. So you're not like going into a temple and then, you know, you'll solve a puzzle and then a Nazi will turn up and you'll solve another puzzle.
There's often stretches where there is no enemy for quite a while.
I like the idea of like, I'm not solving another puzzle until I've punched one Nazi in the face. Give me one Nazi that I can brutalize and then I'll look at your cogs or whatever.
Look at your cogs. Yeah, it can be quite, that's a weird term to use in a game. It's got the Vatican Church and state about how combat and puzzle sections are divided.
There's a, you know, there's really like the linear shorter levels are not really, there's like a maybe a tiny puzzle element to them, but they are mostly like the action sections of the game. And then, yeah, there's a couple of of of of story beats in the in the hub levels that are just puzzle oriented, like Matthew says. So, yeah, it's it's really just really interesting that they've kind of like, you know, they identify that's a clear strength of the character, but aren't embarrassed about it, which would be really easy to have reskinned Uncharted, but put Indiana Jones in it.
That would have been the easiest thing to do with this license. But it's sort of like you can just see it here, feel a developer going, we're going to do this our own way at every stage in this game. And that's one of the things I like about it.
It's really singular as modern blockbusters go, you know, like I don't think there's another developer who would make anything like this if he gave them the Indiana Jones license. You know what I mean?
No, no, absolutely.
Absolutely.
It's kind of interesting that you bring up the point and click games, because even those, I mean, definitely Fate of Atlantis, wrestled with the fact that there are all these parts to Indiana Jones. You know, in that game, you famously picked one of three paths. You kind of went alone, which was like, I'd say, the very hard puzzle path.
You could go in a team where all the puzzles were then built around co-op with the love interest of a game. And then there was the fists path, which was lighter on puzzles, but you had to use the terrible point and click fighting interface to fight Nazis like every 10 minutes. So even then, in an incredibly cerebral genre of game, they acknowledged that to some people, this character does just punch his way through and get that way out.
So, you know, there isn't a neat answer. And, you know, I found MachineGames' attempt at an answer really satisfying, like the balance they struck.
Yeah, absolutely. I think, yeah, that definitely speaks to the strength of the game more generally. And that even carries over to the narrative side of the game, you know.
It's not just the gameplay mix that reflects Indiana Jones so well. It's that the motion capture cutscenes, the scriptwriting, you know, that Troy Baker performance everyone has sort of raved about, really just helps it feel very authentic. So I was curious to know why you think it avoids feeling sort of off-brand or like a redundant side story, which I've definitely played licensed games that feel like that.
You know, I think Marvel's Avengers, despite having the very good Miss Marvel stuff in that game, everyone could kind of, it didn't pass the taste test, you know, people just were not up for that. And it's very dangerous to go after mimicking Harrison Ford, you know, as the film Solo sort of showed us. Like it's, you can't, it's a really hard thing to do.
He's such a one of a kind actor. And so this game, but this game's like, no, no, it's the Raiders timeframe. It's set after Raiders, but before last we say, we're fucking doing this.
And it's, you know, it's just very successful. I was curious why you think it manages to avoid feeling redundant or off-brand, Matthew.
I mean, I guess, you know, at his core, as a character, Indiana Jones goes on a lot of self-contained adventures. Like it is, it is built into who he is, particularly in those first three films, that they're all kind of out of sync, timeline wise and not presented in order. You know, a lot of people don't really get the order of those films and how it all kind of works and what's a prequel to the other thing.
And that's fine because it doesn't really matter. And so that slight kind of shrug about the overarching life of Indiana Jones means you only need like a couple of details to establish him in this, like what's going on with him and Marion, for example. And already it feels like very authentic, so that helps.
For me, I thought the real narrative success of this, apart from like nailing the voice, you know, both the words and the vocal tone of Indiana Jones, you know, it is an astonishing voice actor performance from Troy Baker in this. But like all the supporting characters are just so well observed, like it has a legitimately great Indiana Jones villain, which a lot of Indiana Jones films don't have, you know, it has a great sidekick, it has tears of sidekicks, you know, it has other comedy sidekicks as well as like a love interest. It has different people in different parts of the world.
Like that's a bit like I was saying with Venice in that it is part of the Indiana Jones DNA, but you don't necessarily think of it. The idea that he has traveled the world and has friends everywhere, and there are always people who are happy to see him, and he's a good hang, they're a good hang, and you meet all these people in different places and they all absolutely kind of tick those boxes. Like that's where it feels like they've really done their homework, that this game just has to be full of big characters, they're all a little bit quirky, they feel like they're being played by character actors, real life character actors, whether or not they are.
And that's something which like Crystal Skull didn't get right, Destiny didn't get right, that's really really hard to nail. So for me, so much of the Indiana Jones story feel was just in the scope and balance of those characters. Even Tony Todd, the idea of a sort of secondary antagonist who may or may not actually be on your side, you have to play the game, find out.
That's quite true of these games, he does come across these supernatural figures who are a little bit more unknowable than the Nazis. And just including that in the mix, it's just like, oh, they really get it, you know, there's not a bit of these games, these films that isn't in here somewhere.
Yeah, it's so true. It's, you're right, the balance of character is really just key to it. There was a moment where it was just Voss and Gina sort of interacting.
That was the quest. I think Gina was being kidnapped for, you know, as part of the story. And I was watching it invested in both characters who have nothing to do with the films.
But I didn't even think once until that very moment, oh, these are not characters that are in the films, but I'm watching a story that is set canonically with these films. That's quite an achievement, you know? And it comes down to those performances being so good.
It comes down to specific things like, there's something so 40s or 50s actress about Gina's look in the game, that you're like, you see her face and you're like, that is bang on what a woman from this time in one of these films would look like.
Isn't a face that's seen an iPhone?
No, it's not. Tony Todd, I'm not so sure. I think he's seen an iPhone.
Enrico Colantoni, I think he's also seen an iPhone, unfortunately, but you can't do anything about that. Those are the actual faces in the game. So, like you say, has a great villain that the recent indie films do not.
I will save that for the spoiler chat, Matthew, but I want something else to put.
You can get more into it in the spoiler chat.
Yeah, because it's definitely some more vast chat to be had. But yeah, just blown away by how good it is. I would say that at its very best, this game gives you about 90 percent of the joy that a good Indiana Jones movie gives you.
By good, I mean one of the two good Indiana Jones movies. Two and a half. So yeah, that's quite an achievement.
And it's longer than all the Indiana Jones films put together. That's the other thing that's quite interesting about it, is that it's a much bigger story and you spend... There are more complicated character beats with a lot of characters and you spend half an hour with some of these people, which you just don't in the films at all.
And for them, not to feel like... To feel that time out, like they have to become really psychologically complex, you know, at the same time, they feel sort of true to the pulpy nature of the film, but not so thin that they then feel shallow, you know, along that longer timeframe. It's such a weird balancing act.
Like, the actual challenge of replicating, like, quite a fast-moving two-hour film, but over, like, 20 or 30 hours of game content. Uh, like, the pitfalls are massive.
Yeah, it's so true. It's... I feel like they get around it by the structure of the game, meaning that you never spend too long with one person necessarily.
Like, there's... The fieldwork will give you different people to interact with. And it's true there's not really enough meat on the bones of any Indiana Jones story in order to, like, have a concentrated 10-hour dose of that one story and that one set of characters.
But this game succeeds by going, what if you just had a companion for, like, this quest, for example? Or, like, you know, what if you went and did something completely different to things you've done before? And it finds all these different ways to, like, spread out the different bits of the overall story while giving you lots of other different types of, you know, indie one-off tales.
Like, you're reading a standalone issue of a comic book, for example. Like, in order to just make it feel like you're experiencing this, like, vast tapestry of small stories. And then, like, one big story that's kind of, like, being played out piecemeal.
And I think that's one of the other, like, the triumphs of the structure. You're not sat there thinking, wow, they're really, you know, it's really not, like, loads and loads of detail to an Indiana Jones story. It's like, well, of course there isn't, you know.
It's all about action and spectacle. But this game does everything it can, I think, to make the most out of what you can do with those, with that kind of storytelling. So, yeah.
So, yeah, no block of energy detected in the characters, Matthew, which is good. But with that, no, should we take a quick break and come back and talk about some spoilery stuff in the game, Matthew?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, a bit more spoilery chat in this part of the episode. So, the Raider's intro, Matthew.
I mean, fucking sublime, right? I mean, really like, I've played through that intro like a whole bunch of times now. I've started the game again for whatever reason.
And it's just really incredibly impressive. I showed someone who was not really interested in playing the game, but someone I know, like the intro, and they were like, fucking hell, that looks so good. And I was curious, so do you think the render of Alfred Molina is accurate enough for your liking?
This is the key question. Is it him?
I don't know. Is it like half him and half more authentically like, not a British man who is...
I think it does have that in it. It's kind of like what it should be, maybe a bit more. Not that I've got any problem with Alfred Molina at the start of Raiders.
I think he looks pretty good. Yeah, no, it's a great set piece. I'm trying to think back to whether I had it spoiled for me.
I think I managed to play it pretty much unseen. I think I was aware that that's how it opened. I don't think people have managed to keep it quiet that that is the opening of the game.
I remember you saying to me, like, try and play this without having seen it.
I think it might have been in a trailer or something as well, the boulder and stuff.
Yeah, so it has a bit of that, you know, there isn't that kind of absolute sort of shock. I mean, we speculated way before this game came out about whether it was going to do flashback scenes to the films and do famous set pieces. This is the only one that they do from an earlier film in this.
But, like, you know, what I want to do. And I think particularly in establishing, like, Troy Baker's Indiana Jones impression, having him do stuff that you know really well, it's probably like the biggest, like, lift. Well, let's do the riskiest thing first.
Like, it's literally Indiana Jones saying, literally, the dialogue, you know, in love from probably the most famous scene in all these films. And if that works, then we'll be fine.
Yeah, that's so true. It's that thing as well of, I think it makes the game seem utterly mega graphics as well in that first stretch because the lighting is just so to make it look like the film exactly. Whereas in the game, because you're in much larger environments, there's like this ability you get in the game called lucky hat, where if an Indies knocked out but he's wearing his regular Indiana Jones costume, he can crawl on the floor, find his hat, pick it up, and there's a little animation that plays, puts his hat on and starts fighting Nazis again.
It's fun little power up you can get. But in that, because you see a little tiny cuts in each time of Indiana Jones putting the hat on and doing a little smile, you see Indie in all kinds of weird video game lighting. There are some bits of this game where the lighting is incredible and Spielberg film quality.
There are some bits that are just like, well, this is just a video game where you're meant to just punch these Nazis in broad daylight. It can't be like a cinematographer tailoring it just like so. But that opening sequence is like tip of the spear.
Every bit of lighting in this is going to be perfect. And so it makes such a good impression to you of what the game is going to be. Yeah.
Okay. I think this game on the whole is good at resisting cheap fan service. It would have been really easy to have Salah turn up in the desert in Giza.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, you're right. And the easter eggs that are there are subtle, but they're quite well observed. So I think when you're in his office, you find a letter that's from the girl who's flirting with him in his classroom in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
And it has a direct reference to that. And, you know, there's some subtle references to your dad being spied on by Nazis in some of the documents you find, which I quite liked. I must admit, when I found those in the Vatican, my heart did flutter for a brief moment of like, oh, are they foreshadowing that there's going to be a bit of like Henry Jones Senior in this.
Also played by Troy Baker.
Well, I don't like I believe in their casting process and their ability to bring deceased actors back to life. Normally, a process I find quite abhorrent in popular culture, but actually for some reason, I don't know if they have a problem with here. I guess they're euthifying him rather than bringing, they're not bringing Harrison Ford back from the dead.
But I don't know. I would have loved it if Sean Connery had turned, a Sean Connery looking guy had turned up in this.
I think you're right. I mean, I guess the only one that can be described that way is the actor who plays Marcus Brody, right?
Yes. He's like, Soundalike as well.
Very good sound like. It's a fairly minor role in the game. But you're right.
For whatever reason, you don't think of it like the Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One, for example, the Peter Cushing CG thing.
Is that just hypocrisy or like, I don't know. Not judging these things equally?
I don't know. I think it's because you always know it's a video game, whereas in live action, they're trying to trick you into thinking it's an actual-
The person's back from the dead.
Well, that's what I mean. I know that the context is obvious from that, but still like, look what we did. It just feels somehow more unholy when in live action.
I can't explain why.
I guess none of us look at Robbie Coltrane in GoldenEye and think like, that's inherently evil. We've tried to capture a man's soul in that way.
Yeah, exactly.
Or Hagrid in Harry Potter and PlayStation 1. And we're like, boo, let him go.
Well, obviously he was alive when they made those. That's the other complicating factor. This might have been different if Harrison Ford was not alive when this game was made.
But the real Harrison Ford has praised Troy Baker's performance. He's like, he even said, don't use AI. You can just pay a guy who will sound like, about 85% like Harrison Ford.
And I think I was very generous of him to do that. He didn't have to do that. Most actors don't give a shit who's doing the video game version of them.
So that was very generous of Harrison Ford to bother praising Troy Baker. That's pretty cool. But yeah, that Raiders intro is super good.
But I've got more questions to ask you about that side of things, Matthew, things that can maybe bring in from the other films. So next thing I wanted to want to ask is the MacGuffin in the story. So I believe Todd Howard came up with this.
This is a game idea. I think he came up with it more than 10 years ago. It's quite a long time ago.
And so you are building up to this, basically the search for all these stones around the world. You don't know exactly what they're for, but at one point there is a teleportation sequence that occurs. So you know there's some teleportation elements to these stones that the VOS, the villain in the game wants and the Nazis want for some reason.
And then it transpires that all these stones basically go into the wheel that controls Noah's Ark. Which sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud. But it's the kind of big swing that feels quite Indiana Jones to me.
But I'm again doing that thing Matthew, I'll tell you what I think before you talk about it. So what did you think of the MacGuffin in this game?
Yeah, I mean the thing that surprised me the most is that I genuinely didn't see it coming until they revealed it. Normally with these things you have a sense of like, oh this is going to be this or this is going to be, you know, it's quite up. There's a lot of foreshadowing for idiots in blockbuster entertainment.
And if anything I think they picked storylines and technologies and hints that make you think it's going to be a number of other things. So they actually hide the art quite well. So much of the game is about piecing together this language system of these giants and the idea that it's some magic language system.
That's what I thought the game was going to be about at its heart, rather than like the teleportation element or then eventually Noah's Ark. I think I messaged you at some point. I was definitely saying to Catherine like, I was so sure this was going to be like a Tower of Babel thing and about like a universal language and it being destroyed, you know, like what happened on earth to kind of split everyone up.
So when it wasn't that I was like, oh, I, you know, fair play to you. Like it's, it's very rare that any blockbuster story can like pull the wool over my eyes. That to me feels like I completely buy into the idea that Todd Howard had like a killer Indiana Jones story idea that he sat on for ages.
And he's like, if I ever had a chance, I really think this is good because I think a lot of nerds have those ideas about the things they love. You know, like if you put me in charge of James Bond, I think I've actually got a pretty good James Bond story in me. Because I've thought about it that much and he just I think they really, really delivered.
I mean, it's great. It's a great thing to pick. It's just it's not too daft, but it's got the same sort of biblical energy of the Indiana Jones films.
It's sort of like supernatural, you know, enough, you know, but not. I mean, it is completely out there, the teleportation thing, but it's not like it's not fucking aliens.
You know, what I like about the teleportation element as well is like, oh, I guess conceptually, it would make sense for Noah's Ark to have this, because if the world is being flooded, then it would need to get around pretty quickly to like hoover up all these animals. The game is also very good at shrugging off how preposterous it could be, because I think like there's a discussion at one point about like these, these like floods from the past. And then I think either Indy or Gina says, well, there's always there's always like been floods.
You know, it's just it is what it is. I think what they're basically doing by that is contextualising it as, well, this is just one really weird thing that happened in like a vast history of weird things that have occurred basically. And that helps, I think, rather than you then thinking, is the Bible canon?
Which is a really like dumb, but easy conclusion to draw from this, you know?
But that's, that's, that's like very true of what he goes through in all of the films where he can explain away like 95% of it, but then there's always like already wacky 5% right at the end where he's like, well, that's me told, you know, turns out I didn't know everything. And that's, that's like Indiana Jones' sort of whole deal, is that he could maybe extrapolate, extrapolate the weirdness that's to come, but he doesn't because, you know, there's a bit of cynic, you know, cynicism in him. But then it's, it's kind of what pushes you over the line.
So like you can buy like a weird religion system or there being like a hidden race of really tall people. Like that's feasible enough. But that it's all in aid of, yeah, a giant kind of world jumping arc.
That's the, that's the daffy bit. And then it doesn't linger on that long enough for you to be like, well, this is stupid. Like I think if you spent two hours running around the arc, like fighting animals or something, like maybe this, maybe this game would have like a different vibe at the end.
Yeah, Higa, Higa Giraffe with a shovel, then his wife comes after you to fuck you up.
Did you ever see that terrible Noah film with Russell Crowe?
No, it sounded very cursed though.
Maybe I'm misrepresenting what happens in that film, but I swear the conclusion to that film is Ray Winston is like a bandit who wants to stop the arc from going on its journey. He's like a non-believer. He hides on the arc and he sets sail.
And then he sustains himself in the hull for like months by eating animals. And it sort of suggests that there are species of animals we've not seen because Ray Winston ate them.
Oh my god. Oh dear.
That's his threat. If you fuck with me I'm gonna keep eating the animals. That's like a thing he says.
It's like I'm gonna keep eating these animals to destroy your mission. And you're like this is what is going on here. So like arc stories can go very very wrong is what I'm saying.
Yeah we had Pikachu's once but Ray Winston ate them so they're like no longer exist. Yeah that's wild. I mean that makes me want to see that film.
Less I think. Not more. But that's a it's very very funny.
I did think that as well when I saw the size of the the arc at the very end of this game it was just like so big I thought oh is there like an extended section where I go and find like Foster's office on the arc. I'm glad they didn't try and do that because it would have been a bit yeah.
I don't know where you were sort of in your head space trying to get this finished for the pod. But I am interested like when you saw that arc if there was like a uh oh hidden like fifth act or.
No I like the length of this game you know. I thought it was it's much I think it's much longer than you probably expect from going into it. Like you can easily play about 30 hours of it.
I think I probably did I don't didn't see the end sort of like timer but it felt like that by the end of it but it wasn't quite like what was the last game I played that really stressed me out to finish for this podcast was it Metro Prime that probably is the last one that comes to mind where I was like screaming at fucking Ridley and then like I think I was mad right up until the second we tried to conceptualize what is Ridley on that episode and I was like oh no I think I did enjoy this game actually Matthew Castle was helping me to re-contextualize it that was all the people in a discord like oh weird I think Ridley is really easy and then you just sort of like inside out I went full blueprints again never go full blueprints yeah so yes I thought the length of it was just right and I didn't my heart didn't sink I actually thought it was pleasantly short that last section it's just that and then there's basically like a one tiny bit of like combat and stealth then it's the game is over basically it's like a boss fight with boss then you're done I did know about the Noah's Ark thing for obvious reasons going into it but it's still like it's still quite wild visually what they do with it and like the and boss going after it I mean it's it just yeah like you say it feels like a killer idea that you know one smart game designer sat on for like a decade and thought you know what would be cool is if we did this and yeah he was he was right he bet on himself and he was right so Is it silly that the Nazis try and like own it by sticking Nazi flags on the Ark? Well the Nazis are daft in Indiana Jones aren't they?
They are daft but this is something very basic about like oh let's stick a flag on the Ark, Noah's Ark you know?
Just so people know it's ours but don't try and take it this enormous impractically sized boat. So let's talk about the other short Illiniate levels in the game Matthew because you've got a section in the Himalayas where you're going around this sort of boat that is stuck to the top of a mountain as explained by the teleporting Noah's Ark stones. I mean the story sounds ridiculous if you explain it backwards, if you explain it forwards.
I mean that's true with all Indiana Jones content I think. And so this boat is stuck on top of this mountain. You go in it, there's loads of frozen bodies there, including Gina's sister, Laura, who she is searching for in the game.
Gina is a journalist. And then there's quite an exciting bit after some Nazis arrive where this battleship goes sliding down a mountain. That happens Matthew.
And there's also, you then teleport to Shanghai, which has been bombed by the Japanese. And there's a section where you are manning a turret in a plane. I thought these bits actually worked really well.
And I was thinking, if they forced you to go down one path with all the game mechanics here, is it actually going to function? I probably prefer Shanghai to the Himalayas, but what did you think?
I really liked it. Just as a little breather from the open world maps, what I really liked about the Himalayas is, given that the story is a little bit mysterious, and you haven't quite pegged what it's going to be about, to suddenly see this boat on top of this mountain. And it's probably like the most sort of environmental storytelling section of the game.
So you're picking up all these documents, which are talking about like, you know, an experiment people are feeling a bit unsafe about, you know, Gina's sister is on board the ship, she doesn't really want to do it. You know, it gives you enough to go, oh well, something weird's happened here, to get this boat on top of this mountain. But then it hits you with that kind of wow moment where it does teleport and you suddenly realise, okay, this story is about something else entirely, that's interesting.
But it teleports you into a really pulse-pounding, exciting set piece with planes firing and a completely different level that you didn't think you were going to go to. Did they ever put any of this stuff in the trailer? I don't remember seeing it anyway.
No, I don't. The Himalayas stuff definitely. But I think Shanghai was in there as well, actually.
I was just like, I thought I had the scale of this game in my head. Like I thought it was going to be these three open world areas, and actually it's like way bigger and more ambitious. That's where, I mean, it feels like a really luxurious, expensive game through and through.
But in creating a city that you're in for 15 minutes and this amazing mountain range that you're in for half an hour max, that's where you feel that Xbox money kind of flexing its muscles a bit. And I like it when people put on a show. But burn those fucking assets to please me by all means.
Yeah, I agree. It's sort of like, yeah, so it is a big flex. And it's sort of like they succeed, I think, at giving you the sort of momentum you can't quite get in the hub worlds, because they are locations that are basically like chucked in the shredder for your amusement, you know, because Shanghai has been bombed.
So it's not like you can hang out there and go speak to a guy in a tent and be like, hey, do you mind go fetching me some of these ancient pebbles I left in some mining site or whatever. Those are the kinds of quests you get up to in the open world bits. But here it's like, nope, the Japanese are bombing this city.
It's fucked. Let's get out of here before we die. And that's good.
I think the game needs that momentum when those bits come along. The fact that you get two of them back to back is a little bit of a treat in the game, because then it's a while before you then get into the last hub world. So I think that's some smart pacing as well.
And I like that, Matthew.
What did you make of that weird little hotel bit at the start of Sukhothai?
Kind of liked it, but I got stuck a couple of times. The navigation in this game is sometimes a little bit like, well, where am I meant to go? You know what I mean?
Right.
I think it's because a lot of it depends on you using a book, an indie journal that you get from Marion at the start of the game to track where things are. But it's got a bit of, this is where I think it has a lot of noughties PC energy, where I'm like, am I meant to be here? Which specific window am I meant to climb out of here?
If I keep shooting these guards, will they die? No, I had to die to learn that lesson. So I like the intent of it, but didn't think it was totally successful, you know?
What do you think?
Yeah, yeah. No, I'd agree with that. There's a couple of little areas like that.
It barely registers as a level, but right at the end of the Vatican, there's a bit on the roof of the Basilica, where you're climbing up into an airship and you're like, oh, this feels like there's going to be a big set piece here and then there kind of isn't. There's quite a nice little cut scene that happens up there, but it is a weird, you are right, that early PC energy is the right kind of field to it. We're like, hmm, that's odd that they decided they needed to build this.
This could have been a cut scene.
Yeah, that's where you feel the slight difference between it and the lineage of Sony open, well, Sony third-person narrative heavy things that are just so slick. Like there is a slickness to Horizon God of War, Naughty Dog Games, that is not quite here.
Yeah, I think since playing The Last of Us Part II, whatever it was, director, not director's cut, remastered, where they had the bonus features and they showed like some little levels that they cut or little areas that they cut because they were like, yeah, we just didn't really think these were quite close enough, you know, and they seem absolutely fine, but at the same time, you're like, oh yeah, I get this. You know, like it's sometimes you have to kill your darlings, I guess. And there are a couple of moments in Indiana Jones where you think, this maybe isn't like quite up there with the rest of it, but not that I would like ding it for those things.
It's an interesting like comparison to Wolfenstein, isn't it? Which are so concentrated linear games. Like there's the tiniest like flavour of open world in the second Wolfenstein, I think, when you can go back into levels and do little, little kind of like assassination bits of certain officers, I think.
But like it's, you know, nothing like this. The scope of what they've built here. I think like all, it feels like it almost exceeds their grasp, but not quite.
And then some of the sort of like quirks that that approach gives the game, give it such character that you don't get in slicker, modern Sony type games. That may, I think that makes it well worth it, you know what I mean? Because it succeeds often enough for that lack of slickness occasionally to never really bother you that much, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I much prefer someone doing something different and interesting than the same thing you've seen before. There's no universe in which I prefer this game was Uncharted 4 but with Indiana Jones, you know?
Right, right.
So yeah, yeah, interesting anyway. So, okay, so Matthew, I did want to ask what your pick of the side content was in this game. I'm guessing you're going to pick one of the field work bits.
It's kind of what I had in mind, but you can pick a little mystery that you unpick as well. What was your favorite bit of side content?
Yeah, it's been a few months since I've played this, but I really liked, I think in Sukhothai, yeah, it's definitely Sukhothai. There's the level which you kind of team up with that very sort of Nazi coded young female explorer who's got like big Alison Doody in Last Crusade energy.
You picked the exact thing I have for my favorite side content.
Oh, really? Yeah, I just...
The exact same thing. It's really good.
It's a really good little co-op dungeon. There's lots of nice puzzles. The temple is like way bigger than you think it's going to be.
It feels quite substantial and like worth doing, you know. It's a nice little chunk of adventuring. It's an interesting character and it has this little narrative arc where it goes from like working with someone to them betraying you.
I definitely think they were riffing on the kind of the Last Crusade character there a little bit. Yeah, that just felt like everything that they're really good at in this game kind of coming together.
Yeah, for sure. I like that character a lot. And yeah, the specific puzzle mechanic of these different keys and stopping these little patterns as they go around was really good to kind of give that some one-off flavor.
And the grizzly end of that character was just great. It was like a kind of Indiana Jones story you don't really get elsewhere in the game. The fact that she's a former student as well just gives it that flavor.
Also, like the feeling that maybe MachineGames wanted to put a Swedish character in here. There's maybe a bit of that too as well.
Right, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah. So, yeah, fun, a fun quest for sure.
I don't mean to say Swedish people are Nazi-coded, by the way. That's what I was getting at.
Yeah. It is sort of like slowly dawning on you for sure. But yeah, very satisfying bit of side content.
Really like that. A really small mystery I like in Giza is just the way people think that a cave is like haunted or is like a ghost there. But it's someone just playing a recording through a radio to stop Nazis going in there and looting artifacts.
And-
Big Scooby Doo energy.
Yeah. It was actually the caretaker with a little speaker all along. So yeah, you go in there and you just figure it out.
And it's like, well, you know, it's just like one small story to find in the world. But that kind of thing makes the hub areas feel like they got real texture to them, even if there's not like a cut scene involved and massive expense on the part of MachineGames. So yeah, I like that.
And I believe most of that stuff was built by two people at MachineGames. Like there's a talk about this. I went to a Nordic game a few weeks ago.
Yeah, it was this. There was like a designer. And if I've been a designer and a technical artist or something like that, but they basically went in there and filled the hub areas with like, yeah, like mysteries and civilian population.
There was some content they cut from the game because they didn't feel like it was indie enough. Like there were these drains in the Vatican that you found like gold in basically. And they were like, well, people would have found that gold already and it didn't seem very plausible or Indiana Jones-ish.
So they actually, but yeah, I believe it was a pretty small team that came up with it. That's the impression I got from that talk anyway. So some of these are really good considering that, you know, it's impressive stuff.
So Matthew, I did also want to ask if there are any particular cut scenes or indie moments you'd like from this game as someone who is very familiar with the character.
I think one of the great cut scenes in this, and I genuinely believe it would hold its own in a film, is the interrogation of Indiana Jones and Gina by Vos and Gantz in Giza. Do you remember this scene?
Yeah, the bit when you sneak into the base, right?
Where you sneak into the base and then they catch you. And then there's like a quite a chaotic slapstick fight where Vos' nose keeps getting smashed in. And there's a bit where Gina grabs a gun and stands up in like a, aha!
And as she stands up, she smashes her head on like a shelf that's above her. And that knocks a hammer off, which almost hits Vos in the face and he catches it. And it just had a real sense of like Spielbergian cause and effect, which is, you can't really give someone a higher compliment of like, that is just a great bit of like blocking in a virtual cut scene.
Very, very satisfying. Little like constant power play. You know, it's the first time you really get to know Vos or like talk to him, I think, cause he's been quite a mysterious villain up to that point.
And even like Gantz, like that's a character that's really easy to get wrong. Like, the second henchman to the villain. Like, you know, he could just be a nobody, but he has like his own kind of, you know, desires and failings.
And he has like an interesting kind of, you know, kind of power play with Vos. I was watching thinking this is just so like, like, you know, high tier, like writing and cut scene making. Like I, this is such a pleasure to watch this stuff.
Which is just so very rarely the case in these games.
Yeah, absolutely. There's just, it's sort of like, it doesn't actually feel like there's, there is a lot of cut scene content in this game. If you look on YouTube, there's a lot of it in there.
But most of it is quite brief. And when they do an extended sequence, there tends to be a lot of meat on the bones. It's not like time wasting.
You're never there thinking, get on with it. They're very like careful with it. But the moment I pick, it's going to be super obvious, but it's the confession scene in The Vatican.
Oh, it's even optional. You might not come across it, but there's like basically a black shirt who says, you know, you need to, you know, Indiana Jones is dressed as a priest. And he's like, I need to do confession now.
He's like, well, I forgive you. And then does the thing, the cross thing, whatever that's called, blesses him. And then I didn't grow up Catholic, to be honest.
And yeah, so, and then he's pressured into basically doing confession and then doesn't want to be there clearly. And this guy talks about how he's basically cheated on his pregnant partner with her mother. And now she is also pregnant.
And then, and then he, the, the glass shot kind of susses that Indy is not actually a priest. And then Indy just kind of punches him in the face through the screen and then like leaves, and then leaves the kind of confession booth. And it's so good as a bit of like, oh, you know, you never really see Indy do anything like that in the films, but the tone of it is so authentic.
And when you read all the YouTube comments on that cutscene, everyone there saying that they get Indiana Jones. They get it. There's something about the precise way he addresses that Troy Baker's performance, the quality of the cutscene where you're like, fucking yeah, it's a good moment, right?
You know?
Oh, yes. Yes. That's properly funny.
Yeah.
Yeah. I know how I just think they get off to such a strong start in the Vatican. Like, I know casting Keith Mars is like an instant win for us.
But he is, he's just what a great actor to pick to be like one of Indiana Jones' weird friends. Like, just a very memorable face, very kind of warm, pleasant voice, kind of strange little quirk. Oh, he's great.
Like, it's really, really well judged. Like, I buy that in a way that I, like, I never bought the idea of, like, Ray Winston being Indiana Jones' best friend in Crystal Skulls. That's just like someone wanted to cast Ray Winston, you know, just doesn't fit.
No, I agree with that. It's, yeah, for whatever reason, they're well judged. They never get so tangled up in the lives of Indy that it feels like they try and take over the story.
Like, that lady sort of Barclay in Giza. It's sort of like, it's firmly a side character, you know? It's like you say, it's the balance of characters are just right.
It's, they're never like, it's not like, oh, you're in this area, so your companion for this area is this new character. It's not like that at all. Yeah, your companion is always Gina, and then these other characters are just sort of there.
Much in the same way that like Marcus Brody or Salah are there in the films, right? It's very similar in terms of where they're positioned in the story. Yeah, really impressive, and I think an extra bonus point as well for the way that the actor who plays Vos pronounces Karate is just so good, the two times he does that.
Yeah, those really work. But shall we talk about the, let's talk about Vos a bit Matthew, because I think we've kind of touched on the ending a bit there with the Noah's Ark stuff, we've kind of like got into detail with that bit, so we don't need to go over it again. Vos, is Vos a better villain than Mads Mikkelsen in Dial of Destiny?
And if so, why?
Absolutely, I think he's kind of cleaner cut. You know, there's, you know, obviously the post-Nazi Indiana Jones have like a slightly weirder sort of political situation that they're kind of trying to deal with, and it's not as clean cut, it's just like, great, here's this, this Nazi we can boo his. What I really like about Vos, and why, like I genuinely would put him up with pretty much any of the villains in any of the Indiana Jones films, is that he isn't this stupid figure of fun.
He's quite smart, he's like, like the violent kind of like alpha nerd or something. He's bigger, built, more dangerous feeling version of Indiana Jones, but he's clearly not like a, a foolish man. And he clearly has the same kind of respect and understanding of all this sort of historical sort of mumbo-jumbo that they're digging into.
You know, they could have made him a lot more one note than that, but he's, yeah, he's just, he's a really interesting chapter here. I mean, it's a great face as well, like the motion capture on him and just the shape of him. Like he's, he's just not at all what you expect.
You know, he looks like he's going to be a thug, but then there's like a real kind of like intellect to it. I hadn't really seen that flavor of villain in an Indiana Jones film.
No, the villains are very, very one-noted in the films when you think about it. It's not like it's a film, the concept of the Nazis basically is the villain in these films for the most part. It's just more pronounced with like, Cate Blanchett in Crystal Skull.
And I guess Alison Doody to some extent in Last Crusade, but the Nazis like Belloc, for example, and that Nazi who gets for the very evil, particularly evil looking Nazi with the biggest burns Matthew, that guy in Raiders. Yeah, exactly. So but they're not like substantial characters.
Voss is really like, it feels very considered that character. And so next to Mads Mikkelsen in Die of Destiny going, I'm going to succeed where Hitler failed, which I really lost me when he said that in the film. I was just like, oh, so you're like a mega Nazi.
That's not much of a depth to that character arc, really. That just sort of like, yeah, I tuned out of that. But here, yeah, Voss is like intellectual thug.
It's a great concept for an Indiana Jones villain. It's so exactly sort of counters who Indy is, but his personality is completely different. So works super well.
You buy him as like Indiana Jones at Equal, which works, where like Belloc, he's just so smug and he's so clearly a chancer. It's not the same thing.
But the game never goes into an obvious space of saying, we're not so different, you and I, or even doing that. It actually leaves it to you to draw the parallels, because you'll read notes where he's trying to discredit Indiana Jones, and then you'll get cutscenes where he boasts that he's achieved something that Indy has not, where he's actually right and he has. And it actually emerges slowly that, oh, right, you don't, like you say, you don't see him for large parts of the early part of the game.
And so it only really, the parallels between them, I think, emerge quite late in the game, but they are there. And so it's very well judged. Yeah, I thought the actor was absolutely phenomenal in this.
Real good. Yeah, so Matthew, I've put a question here for you.
Smooth podcasting.
The magic of podcasting. Obviously, I put this as number two in my top 10 list last year. You hadn't played it, so it wasn't in your top 10.
Retroactively, would it have made it, and where would it have gone?
It would have made it. I think I would put this below Astrobot at number five. Move Down Silent Hill 2 Remake, which was my other number five.
Boot out Final Fantasy VII Rebirth from the top 10 altogether. And keep mouthwashing at number 10 where it was. I've really just soured on Rebirth in retrospect.
I don't know if that game was worth the...
Now all the Discorders can give you the crap that I got for not including Astrobot.
It's true, actually. I didn't ever get anywhere near the shit that you got for that for not really liking Rebirth. But I suppose it's because I did include Rebirth in my list ultimately, even if I didn't like it that much.
But yeah. So I definitely put Indie in there. Like it's a bit...
Yeah, Astrobot just pips it a tiny bit. I think it's... Yeah, but top five is good.
Last year was a good year for games. So that's strong.
I know obviously this is a stupid question because it's an Xbox license. If there's a character from this game that gets the Astrobot treatment as an unlockable, who would it be?
Oh my gosh, such an odd question.
It's obviously Indiana Jones, but we can come up with a better answer than that.
Yeah, it would be... I suppose you could do a little Astrobot with a little Voss' little plaster after he gets bombed in the next way.
I am Astrobot Voss.
Ah, yeah. So yeah, not the Astrobot is exactly what everyone's been asking for. That would be perfect, I think.
Yeah, I suppose that makes sense. None of the characters need to be really distinctive by their hair. And by that criteria, Gina is probably the most distinctive of the supporting characters.
So yeah, I got Ipatch Girl in Sucker Type. You never really see much of her.
So yeah, again, Keith Mars, just because he's got a little Vatican outfit on, whatever that cassock or whatever it is called.
The only way they can top Keith Mars if they make another game, Matthew, would be if they put Greg Grunberg in a supporting character. That's the only way that they could exceed the grasp of this game, I would say.
Yeah, I don't know, there's a tier of like early noughties TV actors who I go nuts for. I knew put in either Ron Rifkin or Victor Garba. And I'm like, if they're a pair of people, if one of them is Indiana Jones' dad, Victor Garba as Henry Jones' senior, that is a fucking edge ten from me.
Victor Garba doing a Scottish accent is a cursed proposition indeed. Every time you say Ron Rifkin, it makes me laugh. I just start cracking up immediately.
You've got to respect Ron Rifkin.
He's a great actor. It's just very funny to hear the words Ron Rifkin on a podcast in 2025. Anyway, yes, that's good, Matthew.
Good questions there. So what would you do with a sequel to The Great Circle if you were put in charge, Matthew? Any types of locations you'd like to see in the mix?
I mean, I know I mentioned it earlier. I really do wonder if you try and do the dad stuff as like a game companion in rather than a romantic interest, like it's kind of Gina having like a really weird character who you have to kind of get through situations. I know they've already done it in the film, but like it's the big part.
It's like the only bit of the Indiana Jones puzzle. I don't think he's in the Great Circle. It's that particular flavor of like frustrated Indiana Jones.
Like he's, they always partner him up with people he likes. I don't want it to have like an irritating, like Willie Scott alike in the mix or a short round. But yeah, a dad.
You don't like short round?
Do you not like short round? Did we already litigate this two years ago? Do you not like short round?
I don't mind short round, but it's a little bit twee and sentimental. Like it's the kid thing, isn't it? You know, you get them in there and then all of a sudden you have to be a bit better behaved because the kid's in the mix.
That film isn't. That film is not better behaved.
Yeah, actually, I say that. That film is so dark and horrific.
Sorry, yes, you were saying.
That's what reminded me of all the interviews doing around where Danny Boyle's been talking about how all the naked zombies in 28 years later had to have prosthetics because otherwise it's like child abuse to have like a 12 year old actor around naked bodies.
That's a good point. Yeah, I hadn't really thought of that.
Yeah, so that's a thing. You can see a fake one but not a real one.
We should talk about that film on the XXL episode on Monday, Matthew. Let's talk about it in some detail.
Yeah, I've distracted myself with the talk of prosthetic junk.
Next game, things have been the next game. You say more antagonistic like sidekick.
Yeah, I mean, it's a huge lift pulling off that kind of comic like double act and that kind of timing. Like it's a difficult ask. In terms of locations and things, it's quite hard to picture places that like Indiana Jones feels like it's kind of been everywhere.
I'll controversially say I liked the New York bits in Dial of Destiny at the start. I thought that like looked pretty good. And I thought about that when I was playing this.
Could you do a section where it's really popular? You're like at the kind of Macy's Parade or wherever the equivalent was in like the 30s or just something like that. You know like a populated sort of like period city.
You know what I mean?
That's what I do. In the way that you had like Venice and then the Vatican, I think having a different riff on a modern city or an urban environment that you discover the ancient in. Maybe London, Indiana Jones in London.
Oh yeah, that'd be good actually.
London's a good fit. Like a city with that kind of history because you could have like some Roman stuff in the mix perhaps.
Could take Brody with him as well.
Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, that would work. Go back and see his family.
See all the other Brody's. Have a great cut. I've seen me go to the Brody house and they're like all of them, like young, old man, woman.
They're all a little bit like Marcus Brody. That's a classic two minute cut scene.
Like those old Nicholas Lindhurst, WA. Smith commercials basically. It's all just Brody's face on a little girl.
Except it's sort of Denholm Elliott, yeah.
At that point we might start asking, is this disrespectful to use the likeness of Denholm Elliott in this way? Yeah, that's funny. I like that.
That might be good. I will say as well, I don't know if they ever, I'm with the number one authority on the Indiana Jones Wii game right now, Staff of Kings on this podcast. But I would love to see, I always love the idea of that proposed PS3, 360 era Indiana Jones game where Indies fighting guys on top of the cable car in San Francisco.
I thought that was fucking ace. So you could do that and you can have a bit of Alcatraz going on. That might, maybe the Alcatraz thing might be confusing because then you start thinking about Sean Connery being in the rock, and then yet you're in Alcatraz, but you're in Indiana Jones.
Especially if the dad's there for this game, you can have a great Barry looks at the camera and says the line from the rock. That's a good Easter egg.
Yeah, I like the idea of that. So that came to mind as well. I just like to see, I think because they've done, these locations are a little bit more isolated or just a bit quieter.
It might be cool to see them do something really loud and noisy. You get a little bit of it with Shanghai, but obviously it's deserted because it's being bombed. So yeah, that kind of came to mind, Matthew.
Anything else that you would put into a sequel?
No, I mean, if you told me, well, they did say in advance they were doing like geese or whatever, a little bar of me would have thought, oh, that's a little too close to Raiders maybe. But actually, I really liked what they did with it. So I kind of trust this team.
If they want to go to a place which has been done elsewhere, if they want to try a less problematic version of the Indian stuff, by all means go for it.
A minecart chase would be great actually.
Oh yeah, in first person.
Yeah, and just whipping Nazis out of the other minecarts. I like the idea of that.
And like first person, old thuggy cult guy trying to pull your heart out of your chest.
Oh yeah, yeah, that'd be good.
And you're hammering X to keep your heart in.
That was going to be something I was going to ask you Matthew, if you could recreate one sequence from the films in a sequel game, if they made one, like as an intro, much as listed with Raiders, what sequence would you pick to be recreated by MachineGames?
Last Crusade feels like the really obvious pick, the train.
Well, the intro. Yeah, I immediately thought that as well.
I mean, that is an absolute banger. I mean, the whole River Phoenix of it again, maybe a little bit, I mean, I'd actually just because I'd like to be in that environment and see like a virtual version of it. Like just the big fight at the start of Temple of Doom in Club Obi-Wan, everything goes, anything goes, music, the big gong rolling everywhere.
A scene which is very clear in my head, throwing that fiery kebab thing into the bloke on the other side of the table. Yeah, trying to grab the potion as it gets kicked around. Mechanically, I could see it working.
Yeah, that works. That's cool. Actually, I like that.
Isn't that the only sequence that's written by Casden in that film as well? Because it was cut from elsewhere. Is that right?
Is that correct bit of trivia or am I just talking bollocks?
I don't know if I'd heard that bit of trivia.
I don't know why I think I know that. I probably heard that in the rewatchables, but I'd have to double check that. That's one for me to worry about after the podcast recording Matthew.
Yeah, I like the idea of that. I think Temple of Doom's intro is spot on. You're right.
The Train Sequence would be really like a much heavier lift than the Raiders bit. You play in the Raiders bit, you realize it's only really like three other characters and then a boulder. It's more about the authenticity of how they capture those spaces.
But yeah, if you do something like that, there's just so much more going on in that last Crusade intro. It covers such a much wider space. But if it did bring the dad into it, then that would actually track, wouldn't it?
Because you would need that to link the dad back into the story. So I didn't come out of this thinking, well, that's all you can really do with this. I came out of it thinking, well, I bet people were skeptical about revisiting the Raiders era when this was first announced, but they did such a good job.
I bet they could do it again. It's much closer to the type of indie experience that people actually want, I think, than the recent movies have been. That was going to be a question I was going to ask Matthews.
Do you think this game would have been even bigger with No Dial of Destiny coming before? I think it sold pretty well on PS5 and it was played by millions of people on Game Pass. I think it did the job for Xbox.
But do you think, did Dial of Destiny have a cooling effect on Indiana Jones?
Yeah, or is it a bit chicken and egg and maybe Indiana Jones was already like, maybe the people who watched it in the 80s are dead, like half of them or something.
They're dead and being bought back as virtual puppets now. I think it's maybe more of that. I just wonder if Indiana Jones just doesn't quite mean the same thing or hasn't crossed over generations as much.
It's hard to say because neither Crystal Skull nor Dial of Destiny were like necessarily the ones to prove it. Like if they were five star masterpieces and performed badly, you'd be like, hmm. But then they were both like a little bit kind of three star reviews.
So hard to say. Yeah. You know, maybe this game just has been played by the core, you know, sort of 55 to 25 year old to like Indiana Jones.
And that's it.
Yeah. My brother likes Indiana Jones, but that might be because I just deliberately passed it along to him, got him to watch them with me. But yeah, I can see why, you know, we talked about this on that episode we did two years ago, but it's so distant, the influences that led to Indiana Jones.
Only people of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's ages, you know, remember those things, the serials that inspired them. So, to our generation, really, indie is the kind of origin point for a lot of that stuff. Like, it's as far back as our own references really go for this kind of adventure movie type thing.
So, I think you're probably right, you know, still millions of people played it. So, it's done, I think it's definitely done the job, but it's just one of those things where I was like, oh, I kind of almost like to see the world of what happens if you release this the year before Dial of Destiny, and it's a bit like, oh, you know, Crystal Scar we didn't like, but years later, look at this awesome video game. And maybe it has a tiny bit of the baggage of Dial of Destiny, but it's probably, you're probably right, it's probably turned out the way it was going to no matter what, you know?
Yeah, maybe in that hindsight, like opening a potential sequel with a big song and dance number is not necessarily the way to go to for like mass success and popularity.
And that big table spinning on its side, that could be great fun, I think, in first person. So, I don't count yourself out, Matthew. Last question, yeah, so another question I want to ask along similar lines.
If you could have Troy Baker play a Harrison Ford movie character in another licensed video game, what would you choose?
It's got to be the future tip, right?
Well, that would be, what would the game be though? Because all of us has really run away.
You're Richard Kimball.
You are Richard Kimball. That should be at the back of the box.
Tommy Lee Jones is a Mr. X Tyrant style who's constantly after you. You can never ever stop because Tommy Lee Jones is slowly marching after you, shouting out his couple of catchphrases from the film.
Yeah, I don't care. Yeah. So my impression of him is surprisingly good.
I practiced it a lot during the pandemic. I did both the Harrison Ford bit. I didn't kill my wife and I don't care.
I started just reciting that to myself in 2021. It was a dark time, Matthew, but why didn't I? It's like one of those trick stories that ends in a meme, but Mr. X being the core concept of the game is the meme, and I got trapped yet again by you describing this game.
That's good. I mean, the more obvious answer would be say something like Blade Runner. But again, he doesn't really do much in that.
He just kills like five characters, and that's basically all he does in the whole film.
It's a harder, I'd say that's a harder performance for Troy Baker to mimic as well, because it's quite a subtle low, like he's good at playing like the extremes of Indiana Jones voice. We've definitely talked about this before, but when he shouts or is shocked or surprised, he sounds so much like Harrison Ford. That's where it's really uncanny when he's like, well, I am really serious about this.
It's just the hoarseness of it. It's so specific.
Yeah. You're right. It's true.
Okay. Well, I'm going to pop my little text document pitch for a What Lies Beneath game into my recycled bin Matthew, and move on to the final section of this podcast. I'm going to read out some bits of trivia in this game to you.
You're going to know some of these things inherently, I think. But I definitely have to credit the YouTube channel Indiana Jones Nerd for these. But yeah, I'm sure you spotted Club Obi-Wan in Shanghai, right Matthew?
Did you actually fly through it when it's on fire? That's like probably the most sort of obvious reference, but they really make you wait for it. You know what I mean?
Yeah.
So that's super good.
It's not quite as good as being in that club, watching that song and dance number and hiding behind a giant interactive gong.
No, that's true. I am going to just fire through these because I don't expect you to go, wow, and be impressed by every single one.
Okay. I don't have to say something for each one. Yeah.
Okay. So no, you don't have to. So in Giza, there is a letter written by a journalist called Maria Smirnova, rejecting an interview with Voss and shutting down the notion that Indy is a fraud as alleged by Voss.
This is a character from a French language series of 90s comic books. And yeah, there's even like, I think there's in the little camp you can find in the Raiders intro to this game. You can also find another letter involving her, but super niche references.
But that shows how kind of deep they've gone with it. Thank you for saying, whoa, though. I appreciate that.
Several of the professors referenced in the Marshall College section on the map are from the Indiana Jones role playing game in 1994. That was released.
I didn't know that was a thing.
Yep. The dance referenced on the posters at Marshall College has music provided by Willie Scott. So reference to, oh, you spot that.
Well done, Matthew. Classic. Yep.
You also see a drawing from the Temple of the Forbidden Eye Disneyland ride in the Marshall College section, which I went on in Japan apparently, but I was too ill to remember any details from it when I was there.
You had your convenience store chicken fever.
Exactly. I'd eaten so much that it started destroying my own brain cells. There's a reference to an Indiana Jones comic that only lasted two issues in this game.
I only mention this because I think it's called Indiana Jones Adventures. It looks like it was an all-ages thing. But part of it took place in Uppsala, Sweden, which is where the studio, MachineGames is based.
So I think they just couldn't resist basically and chuck that in there. So you might have caught this one. The rhythm of the blues record that he gives to Keith Mars in the Vatican is a reference to a young Indiana Jones Chronicles episode called Mystery of the Blues, which is the one episode that Harrison Ford actually appeared in, Matthew.
Did you catch that?
I didn't catch the reference. I know the episode, but I didn't know. Oh, right.
Yeah.
There we go.
Yeah.
I was about to joke. I wondered whether there was any young Indiana Jones stuff in this.
Well, there's one more, which is there's a young indie reference. Apparently, the fact that father Antonio, Keith Mars, calls him Henri is a reference to an episode where he enlists in the army in Belgium. And so that's why he basically takes that name when he's in the army.
And I think that's when he first encountered Antonio canonically. So that connects again, back specifically to a young indie episode. I mean, I've not seen that one, but this...
I think he has a Belgian sidekick called Remy.
Oh, right. Yeah. Well, that sounds about right.
But yeah, I was quite impressed by that reference.
Yeah, that's some good, deep cuts.
Yeah, well, I've got a couple more for you. So, sorry. You're like, I was ready for that.
I was ready for that section to be over. There's a market stall in Giza selling fine leather jackets. It's apparently a reference to Point and Click Games, Matthew.
Apparently, first seen in Last Crusade, you picked up on that one.
Was that a Monkey Island reference?
Oh, maybe it was, but it's definitely a Lucasfilm, a LucasArts Point and Click thing. And then the other one was, do you know the Marshall Barnett College thing? Do you know about all that?
Basically, the game, this is not really trivia, but it unpicks like in Last Crusade, Indy is at Barnett College and obviously in Raiders, he's at Marshall College and then he's at Marshall again in Crystal Skull. And apparently, because he gets fired in this game from the college from going off for going off an adventure, that basically solves that canonically because he leaves Marshall, goes to Barnett and then comes back to Marshall later on. So that basically is a tiny bit of like, I think probably just the names were mixed up when they're making the films or something, but that's like a bit of lore that the game sort of tries to solve.
That's super deep cut stuff, but I thought I'd mention that. And finally Matthew, did you know that the intro to this game is a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1982?
There we go. Was this the whole bit just for that?
No, that was just one little, one cheeky, I was hoping for a better reaction, though, to be honest.
Oh, that's okay.
I'm going to go kill myself after this. No, I'm only joking. And to end with, I thought it would be funny to share this quote from an interview I did on GI.bears with MachineGames Jens Andersen, who was the design director on the game.
And I was really curious to just know if watching these movies had ruined, making this game would have ruined these movies for them, basically. So I asked, can you watch the indie movies in the same way now after using them as reference materials for so many years? Honestly, no.
I'm not sure I'll ever be able to watch them as anything other than reference material ever again. We've lived so close to the franchise for such a long time, that you can't stop yourself from picking apart every environment and scene in case there is something more to learn there. Threshing your machinery, Matthew, for example, not kicking an art scene to those.
The brain just automatically spins up ideas on how you can turn that segment into a video game. And since the game is out now, I'll probably take a little rest on the movies, however great they may be. That made me chuckle because I think it was similar for the...
I think we talked to Will Porter about this, about Alien Isolation, right? And how basically, just those... You can't watch that film in the same way after making a game like that.
So they sacrificed their love of a great movie so you could have a fantastic video game basically. So yeah, that's all my points and my plan, Matthew. Did you enjoy talking about this game?
I did enjoy talking about this game. It's a fun one to go back to. Cause I felt, yeah, I felt like we didn't really get into it last year for obvious reasons.
So it's nice to have a good old Indiana Jones chat.
Yeah, absolutely. I was hoping it would have a bit of a sort of book club feel that people have had time to check it out. And even if they haven't, they can enjoy the first half and come back to it later.
But yeah, good to discuss, Matthew. I think just indie is one of those things that, you know, we're of that generation where it matters to us. So it was just great to see a developer take the assignment so seriously, you know?
Yeah, it's really raised the bar. Like for like, you know, I know they have nothing to do with it, but like it would be very hard to play the new James Bond game without putting it in the shadow of this game.
Yeah, absolutely. So what an achievement by MachineGames, great stuff. Well, that's this episode done, Matthew.
If you'd like to support the podcast, it's patreon.com back page pod. As mentioned, we have additional episode coming on Monday, exclusively for Patreon XL tier members, which is our favorite TV shows and movies of the year so far. So a bit of pop culture chat there and you get another podcast each month about games.
Next month, we're actually trying our first ever paywalled draft. This has only happened because of some behind the scenes scheduling stuff that I won't go into. But we are doing basically a one-off draft behind the paywall.
So studios have been closed down. Obviously, that's happened a lot in recent years. We'll pick games exclusively by those studios, paying tribute rather than it being a ghoulish exercise for bands, just making that very clear.
We will not be reanimating the corpse of Moff Tarkin.
That won't be happening on that episode. So that's the episode done, Matthew. Where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and Letterboxd, where I've started sharing some awful takes again.
Yeah, that's like a whole situation you've got going on over there. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Blue Sky and Letterboxd as well.
And the podcast is at Back Page Pod on both Twitter and Blue Sky. If you'd like to follow us, keep up to date on what's going on with each month's episodes, etc. Matthew, let's get out of here.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
