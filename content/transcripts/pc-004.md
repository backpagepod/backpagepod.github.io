Hello there, we're back. It's another episode of PC Gaming Classics, AKA The Backer Page Podcast. I'm Phil Iwaniuk with me as always, my trusted friend and confidant, Jeremy Peel.
Hello, Jeremy.
Hello, how are you doing, Phil?
I'm all right, thank you. I'm still a little bit sniffily from my ailments. I've basically spent about two and a half weeks in bed, neck in supplements.
So it's been a vintage period.
How are you? I'm good. It's Valentine's Day now, so we have that.
We do. We'll always have that.
Yeah. Do you feel like reflecting on our relationship? That's all today?
Well, I always feel like doing that, but I suppose today gives us a mandate. So yeah, as all in many ways, I didn't even realize I was doing a double entendre there, a mandate to talk about our relationship. So yeah, we are recording this on February 14th.
You'll be listening to it later on in February, but right now, let's just reflect on what love means. And to me, it means never having to say I've made an edit in your John Romero interview piece, Jeremy.
Yeah. I mean, that is the most romantic thing a writer can hear, isn't it?
Yeah. Great review, by the way. That's what you get, isn't it?
You don't get much more than that. Thanks. Yeah, got it.
Great review, by the way.
Cheers. Yeah, that's love in freelancing.
Yeah.
Yeah. And podcasting is very intimate, isn't it? Because as I've discovered now, I've started doing my share of the editing.
You get to hear all the like, all the little mouth noises that a friend makes.
I've got some particularly bad habits when I want to say something, but I'm like too polite to just barrel in and be like, yeah, and the thing is, I go sort of, it's just like a little mouth smack and just go, yeah.
Actually, yeah, I know the one, I know the one. I edit them out, but I keep them all in a special folder for personal use.
One day, you're going to give them to Kanye and he's going to turn them into like a sort of trap noise. It'd be like a...
For my part, the thing I do is if I do a big laugh, then sometimes you get a little sort of simpering at the end and I always edit those out.
I haven't noticed that. I genuinely haven't noticed that. Now I'm going to...
Next edit I do. I'll be absolutely on it. Maybe I'll make a...
You amplify them.
I'll add a reverb tail to each one, so it sounds like you're falling down a hole as you do it. That'll be good. We should say that this episode is going to be about XCOM, the original 1993 alien invasion magnum opus.
Which is fitting right now. We've just had a weekend where the US was shooting down unidentified objects in its airspace.
Yeah, what are your thoughts on that?
I was amazed to hear a BBC News report where they said the US had refused to rule out extraterrestrials. I've never heard this in my life before. I don't know, I mean, for you, they don't think it's extraterrestrials.
The first object they shot down was what the US says was a Chinese spy balloon and the Chinese say was a weather balloon, I think. And then they shot three more things down, which are smaller. And I heard in the news report that for one of them, it wasn't obvious how it was propelled.
And I really felt like I was being led down the path of UFOs, which is very weird.
Yeah, it's this sort of perfect timing. If this later becomes the first harbinger of a nuclear apocalypse, then maybe we'll reflect on that weekend differently. But for now, it was just a fun weekend when we fought off aliens in a game and then there were also some alien vibes going.
I think aliens is the best possible outcome. That's the best possible explanation for it.
I guess so. Brings us together, doesn't it? That's what XCOM has taught us.
Yes. And also that fighting off aliens is super easy, always works out absolutely fine and doesn't disrupt life in any way. So yeah, that should be fine.
What have you been up to over the last few weeks since we last spoke on an episode, Jeremy? What have been the big beats for you?
I have not been doing anything particularly different. I can mention I've been starting to spin up a Patreon for my writing. This doesn't exist at the time of me recording and probably won't by the time this goes out.
But I'll run it by you. I've decided to call it the Peel Perspective. What do you think of that?
I like it because it's pompous, but knowing.
That's me. So yeah, hopefully, you know, at some point soon, listeners, if you're interested, there'll be a little Patreon to begin with a couple of articles a month, which I may or may not be calling Jeremy's jackpot, because you might get something about a game from the 90s, or the 2010s or the noughties or now, and yeah, hopefully, I'll expand it from there, or it might down its arse.
I'm sure it will.
But you know, future listeners, you might know which way it went, and you can hear this as poignant or prophetic accordingly.
I think it's a great idea. I think that's the big puzzle in your life when you sort of pursue any sort of career around games is like trying to make it pay, right? Like trying to remain doing the thing that you like and that you're good at, and that still sort of pays you on an escalating scale according to your experience and, you know, hopefully you're developing skills and things.
So yeah, and that's what platforms like Patreon allow is for people to actually be, you know, fairly paid for that rather than having to, you know, ascend a more traditional corporate hierarchy, where often I've certainly I've found that, you know, the higher up you go, the sort of the more detached you become from the thing that got you into the industry in the first place. So I might sling you a quid or two.
Thank you very much. Yeah, the stuff like Patreon didn't exist when we started out, did it? It wasn't an option, and the other thing about freelancing is that you sort of by its nature, you sort of disseminate everything in every direction, right?
Which I have loved, and I still do like, like the fact that, you know, PC Gamer and Edge and Rock Paper Shotgun, these places that I've loved since I was a teenager, want to host my words, I still pinch myself about that and I still love that. But it, yeah, something about the idea of actually owning something for myself and following some of those things in the same direction is appealing at this point. So appealing, there's another pun, I'm sure I can use that on some level on the Patreon, I think.
Anyway, how's your past few weeks been apart from being terribly ill?
I was playing for Spoken.
Why did you do that?
For, well, I was being paid to play for Spoken. No, honestly, I think, like, I do understand why the reviews have been the way they are, why the reception is the way it is and I, you know, my reflections are very similar, but I do also have a bit of a soft spot for it because I think Frey is a cool character. I know she's been dragged over the coals for talking too much and, but I think there's something in that premise and in that character, it's just not quite allowed to flourish.
And I doubt we'll ever see a sequel, right, because it's not sold brilliantly. I think Hi-Fi Rush has outsold it in its launch week on PC anyway, but yeah, so that's probably the end for For Spoken, but it just seems like a massive shame because I think there is a game in there that really wittily and shrewdly sort of pokes fun in, you know, like if you've ever watched that YouTube series, Viva La Dirt League, they do a lot of PUBG skits and have a character called Epic NPC Man. It's all about every sketch is about sort of poking fun at the conventions or logic of a particular game.
And I felt like For Spoken was teed up perfectly to do that. And Frey could have been like, well, why do I have to like, how do I, how am I seeing that there's a little quest marker over there? Like, it could have been that right?
Or it could have given you a deeper experience of being in a fantasy game world by just sort of completely leaving you to it and not explaining the rules and taking more of a sort of From Soft approach to it. And in the end, what it did was somewhere between a Quantic Dream interactive bit of cinema and, you know, your traditional UB open world game. And I don't think that really allowed the premise to flourish.
So it was a shame.
I think we're both of the slightly contrary mindset as well that if a franchise is sort of closed off, knowing that it's probably going to be a one-off, we're just suddenly endear to that.
Absolutely. Yeah.
Slight, slight whiff of failure. But also just like the fact that something's a one-off, you know, makes something a bit special.
Yeah.
Even if it's a little sad as well.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And you don't, I guess because you know that you're not going to get fatigued by it and it's not going to be around your throat, around down your throat with the season passing three years when it comes back.
You can just reflect on it a little bit more kindly, but so that was a shame. Anyway, listen, coming up, we've got, you know, many gems for you, including the latest episode of Review Wars, where Jeremy and I sort of produce a strange audio landscape that conveys our thoughts on the game of the episode in the style of a 90s review. It's quite arch as concepts go, but we enjoy it.
We'll also have our personal recollections on XCOM before finally putting it through 90s games court. And to be honest, the prisons, the 90s games prisons are absolutely empty. The gates are just clanging open and shut in the breeze because we I don't think we've convicted any one of them so far.
They've all they've all been acquitted. We're like Kim Kardashian's dad, aren't we? We're just too good at getting them off.
Yeah, we're yeah, we've turned out to be very a very forgiving society, I suppose, that we've created within this podcast.
Yeah, you know, and we believe in rehabilitation, you know, to be slapping sentences on these games 30 years after the fact ignores all the work they've done on themselves in the last three decades.
So yeah, yeah, I look forward to Jurassic Park trespasser being reintroduced to society.
It is bricking it. I'll be honest, it is bricking it, the idea of 90s games court.
Okay, well, let's let's get into a little bit of a bit of XCOM then. So Jeremy, as always, what are your very first recollections about the 1993 turn based strategy meets management game, XCOM, UFO Defense?
Is it 93? Is it as early as that? Flipping heck.
Oh, you've got me doubting myself.
No, I'm going to check.
94, it's 94.
94. There we go. Still unfathomably early.
Most franchises that existed at that time in PC Gaming are not still around. There's Doom and that's about it, right? Pretty much everything else.
Monkey Island. Monkey Island is still going strong.
That's true. It's the most recent release last year. So, yeah.
Oh, franchise fatigue. All those Monkey Islands.
Take a break. Give us a few years.
Honestly. Yeah, so my first encounter with it, I think must have been reading about it on forums and probably in the comments of places like Rock Paper Shotgun in the noughties and getting the sense that this was, at the time, something that hadn't been followed up on and hadn't been equaled and was very special. Very special and particular.
Really special.
Yes. Type of game that blended tactics and sort of global strategy, and I was intrigued by that because I hadn't played anything like it. And I first played it in that same first year uni halls room that I played the first Fallout in.
And I have a very clear memory before the Christmas where I got the 360, which was my first ever console, of sitting in my room on my laptop and playing on XCOM. And a couple of my mates wandered in and they saw the screen and they laughed pityingly. And I completely understand why.
Because what would they have been looking at? How would you describe how XCOM looks or would have looked in like 2008? Not better, certainly.
It's a sort of arbitrary grid of little men shuffling to and fro, isn't it? That's the best way to describe it.
Yeah, but I did fall in love with it and it has this sort of unique constant tension. A little like the tension we're feeling during this episode knowing that I've got a food delivery coming, not knowing exactly when. So I stuck with it for quite a while despite it being this unfathomably ancient and very fiddly tactics game.
I fell in love with it and unlike Fallout, I didn't know at the time it had any prospect of reboot, of certainly of it becoming a mainstream proposition ever again. That seemed ludicrous at the time. You know, turn-based tactics genre was pretty much in the same place at that time in terms of fiddliness and bugginess and niche-ness.
There wasn't really any prospect of it becoming anything more than that.
Well, yeah, I guess because XCOM was still the template for anyone else that wanted to make a game in that space. It was just about trying to make it as much like XCOM as possible, right? So yeah, I guess it wasn't really evolving until XCOM itself did.
My first exposure to it, I guess, would have been through the anecdotes that games writers used to drop in. It was a really good anecdote-generator game and it really captured my imagination because I hadn't played it. Again, in 1994, my first PC was Windows 98 and you just couldn't go back very easily and play those older games.
So I didn't play it and it never really occurred to me to play it, but I heard these stories about what went on and people had named some of their squad and told these really personal tales and I just imagined what that game must have been like. Again, it's that thing of not really knowing how games work and where the limits are, where the boundaries of what's possible within them. XCOM really captured my imagination in that way because how could you have all your friends fighting aliens and how could you be building out a base at the same time as doing these battles in minute detail?
It just sounded all quite fantastical and very different to anything that I'd played so far.
Yeah, and almost the Dwarf Fortress of its day in that respect, right? And I've always been drawn to those kind of anecdote-generated games as well. I think it's something that XCOM has in common with Warhammer-derived stuff like Blood Bowl.
You know, there's stuff that involves a high element of chance and plans that go awry and they just lead to sort of great comic stories and for the same reasons a lot of people struggle with these kinds of games because they can feel unfair and brutal, but I think for a certain kind of person who can spin almost with a sort of British sitcom attitude, spin sort of tragic series of events as quite funny actually, you can really get into that kind of those kind of mishaps and surprises that occur when you play in a game like XCOM.
You laugh or you'd cry because it's a very very difficult game and things go wrong on a minutely basis. It was fantastically well received at the time, right? Looking back in 1994, I wasn't following the games press at all, but looking back retrospectively, tons of 9s and 10s and I mean IGN, I don't know when they would have reviewed it, but it says here IGN gave it a 9.4 out of 10.
So maybe the first week when IGN launched, they just were like, okay, let's just start working our way from the start. What did Pong get? A few weeks later, they went to XCOM, 9.4?
Yeah, slap it up. So yeah, so it had a big impact, didn't it? And it sort of, it just about drew out the template of that turn-based tactics.
You know, I guess Jagged Alliance is a bit of an XCOM game, right? Maybe that's actually my first exposure to XCOM is playing Jagged Alliance. But that was its impact throughout the 90s is that it birthed a very specific genre of games that either just wanted to do the combat in turn-based grids or wanted to do that plus a layer of, you know, base management and personnel squad management and development as well.
Yeah, exactly. There's something about that interplay between the tactical layer and the strategic one. The fact that each has an impact on the other, which is still really alluring.
And it's also a rare sort of happy story of publisher interference, right? I've read this about X-Conf that it was originally going to be Laser Squad 2. So this was, you know, Julian Golop and his brother Nick and Mythos Games in the 90s were making these turn-based tactics games, which were just the battles.
And they intended this to be the same. And they took it to Microprose, who at the time were, it was the company built around Sid Meier, right? But they were also a publisher and they said, we like it, but we'd like it to be more grand on the scale of civilization.
And Julian Golop said, all right, yeah, I'll have a think. And he went away for a couple of weeks and he came up with the GeoScape, the globe and the economics and all of that stuff and came back and they said, oh, yeah. And they also gave him the idea of it being themed around UFOs, you know, XCOM would not be the thing it is and be as beloved as it is if not for Micropose saying, oh, can you uh, would you mind revising this pitch for us, please?
Amazing. Oh, well, well done Micropose. Also the publisher behind Jeff Crammond's Grand Prix series, which is very dear to my heart.
And I particularly like the GeoScape in Jeff Crammond's Grand Prix, where you were. You fight off the alien forces by setting fast lap times. You can't do one without the other, can you?
Because one of my favourite games from the late nineties is Gangsters Organised Crime. I don't know if you remember it from Hot House Creations. And that's really, that's only the management there in XCOM.
So you're like recruiting a load of hoods from the tenement blocks of, I think it's Chicago where it's set. And you're buying in the cars and the guns and all the, well, everyone you recruit has like a big stat menu of attributes and it's all super detailed. But then when you send them out onto missions, they just sort of go to it.
And you don't even really, they just go in a building and do it. And you don't see what happens in the building. They're just like, they've either done a bank job or they haven't or they've extorted some money from them or they haven't.
So that's like, I guess that's a little bit like XCOM with the fiddly granular taking control of your troops removed. It was still good, but it probably would have, I always felt a little bit cheated that it was like, oh my God, I can do a bank heist or I can go to, you know, my rival mob boss's headquarters and like petrol bomb it. That sounded incredibly exciting.
But then in reality, what you would do is assign them that task. They would just drive somewhere and they would just really casually walk in and they would either never walk out because they had been shot and killed and that was the end of the mission, or they'd just calmly walk back out. You'd get a little pop-up menu that said the mission had been completed and then they'd drive back to the house.
So you need both, is I think what I'm saying.
Yeah, that's how Scorsese would shoot it now, isn't it? Back when he would have filmed the fight, but now he would just show you the quiet aftermath and let you piece it together.
Yeah, there'd be some good conversations in the car, wouldn't there? Some good non-secateurs on the way over.
Yeah, I guess X comes unusual in this kind of structure of game, in that it doesn't let you auto-resolve fights. You know, if you play Total War or something like that, you can do that. If you think that a fight is going to be boring because you know how it's going to go, or you know, you don't feel like ordering people around, then you don't have to.
And I think if XCOM did give you that option, then you probably would end up opting out of the battles fairly quickly, wouldn't you? Because there's such a struggle to kind of get to grips with the particulars of and trying to figure out what works and what doesn't. It can so easily go wrong that I think you probably, if there was a way to just stick in like as many troops as you could into the Sky Ranger, arm them with the best stuff you could to the point where the odds of victory were in your favor, then you probably would end up just sort of automatically resolving it and maybe never kind of be forced to appreciate the painful but inspired tactics.
That's very much the trajectory of my Total Wargaming experience. It's only until Warhammer 2 that I stopped doing it that way, where I would just make this 20 stack army really early on of the best troops possible and I would just sort of saunter around the map looking at that victory probability bar chart thing and if it was anything lower than like 80-20 I would just like run off and beat up someone else instead. Just auto resolve it, barrel in, that's another town giving me a bit more gold to build a bigger army and yeah, you know, it's actually a bit more rewarding to finally, 20 years on, to learn the real-time battle system because there's quite a lot going on in it.
Yeah, imagine your surprise when you realized that there was a battle system in Total War.
I just accidentally clicked the button one day, I was like, oh my god, I triggered a cut scene. So yes, battling is good, it's incredibly fiddly, but I guess we'll get into that in our personal experiences later on. We better get on to Review Wars before too much longer and reveal the results of the last Review Wars in our episode, which is all about the original Fallout.
Before we do that, though, maybe we should go through some lovely comments on the Discord from people about our previous episode. Do you have anything, Jeremy, to share with us?
Yeah, I have one here from Campbell, he said, listen to the Fallout episode this morning. I have to say that Review Wars has quickly become one of my favorite Back Page segments. Picking a winner is a real Sophie's choice, as they've all been excellent.
I've heard a reader use the term Sophie's choice on a recent Mainline Back Page episode as well. So for whatever reason, a lot of people are reading and watching Sophie's Choice in the Discord at the moment.
It's on the Book of the Week. Also on the topic of Review Wars, Samuel W. Roberts, I don't know who he is, says it was an Edge review intro versus a PC Zone review intro this week, referring to the...
the Review Wars and I have one here from Ian Welby, who also said, really enjoyed today's episode. Feels like Phil and Jeremy are easing into their own rhythm with these. And it was interesting to hear an extended Fallout chat, as it's a game that would be my sort of thing, but before they became my sort of thing.
I think I did try the original Fallout once long ago and bounced off it in those early rap fights. That is absolutely understandable, Ian. Maybe if I'd encountered a fellow hapless Ian, it would have drawn me in because he's called Ian, Jeremy.
That's what he's getting at there.
Yeah, our companion in Fallout, yeah. He refuses to wear armor. I've got one from Dathy, which says, yeah, really fun format.
The review was, I never played System Shock or Fallout, so it was great just focusing on Phil and Jeremy chat about it instead of remembering my experience with the games. You know, we could make it all up, couldn't we? People haven't played the games.
Never heard of them.
What would you have liked to have been in XCOM that wasn't? I think I would have liked more pats on the back. You know, I've never had a mission rating that said I'd done more than OK.
So I think I'd like, you know, just a couple of fireworks and some party poppers or something to make me feel better.
If they'd just really done up your base when you got back to base and put streamers up and things, be like, you know what? All right, you lost three people, but good job. You know, fighting aliens is hard, Jeremy.
Come and have some sausage rolls. I think I'd have probably a few more 90s Premier League footballers in there because really the only reason prior to this that I would ever load up DOSBox and run a game from the first half of the 90s would be to play a championship manager. And I think I would have gotten more out of this game if I was sending, you know, Dwight York and Ian Rush and Jamie Radnap and that sort of the like out in those sky rangers and fighting aliens with them.
Because then I could have really invested in this. That's the same way that I do when I'm managing them as strikers or holding midfield as a champ man. So a fairly niche take there, but that's, you know, that's me.
Yeah. Got another one from Peter Max Bandit who said, I'm really enjoying this series, even though I don't really have any relationship with the games. I think my nearest connection is an ex once made me one of the recipes from the Fallout instruction manual.
Ah, that's lovely.
So that'd be the iguana on the stick, presumably.
Maybe that's why they're an ex.
And how do you infuse, how do you infuse a meal with radiation? Yeah, I've never attempted that.
No. Well, I guess there's, is there any other way that radiation interacts with things other than infusing it?
I guess, but you'd sort of want it targeted, wouldn't you, rather than just lingering in your house.
That's true.
I think this is one of the disappointing aspects of radiation that Marie Curie and others discovered. You can't contain it in one spot very easily.
Very blunt instrument in the kitchen. Oh yeah. Bob Bob, Basher's number one fan, said, Really enjoyed The Backers' Pod.
You're really finding us stride as podcasters. Love Phil's weird criteria for playing games he likes. Don't know what you mean.
I've got perfectly normal criteria. Jeremy's Christmas anecdotes, and poor Ian. And you were very informative and interesting about the actual game as well.
Should have probably mentioned that too. Well, you did, Bob Bob. So thank you very much for those kind words.
Okay, well, let's get into Review Wars. I'm always slightly remiss to do this because generally, this is the point where you told me that I lost the last episode of Review Wars and I have to try and take it in good grace even though mine was definitely better. So, let's just get that out of the way.
Jeremy, who won the last episode of Review Wars?
That was me. That was me, Jeremy Peel.
Well, that's fine. That's absolutely fine. Once again, that's certainly fine.
Have we got the numbers?
Sure. Why not?
Oh, is that classic? Brexit split 74.2% to 25.8%.
Oh, man. I was feeling quite confident about that one. I thought I've put in the silly voices.
It's sort of about the game. Once again, it doesn't function as a review intro, but that's never stopped me before. Yeah, the cowboy angle really captured people's imagination.
To be honest, when I did hear that, I was like, this is clever. This is a clever take on. I've still not learned my lesson because this week's review wars, it still doesn't function as a review intro.
I just get distracted and I go off down an avenue of thinking, this concept might be funny, and then I forget that it's supposed to be a review.
Yeah, you told me that yours was incredibly strange.
It's super weird.
Mine is also quite strange. This is going to be...
Yeah.
Yeah, magazines like to do themes, so I guess this will be our weird episode.
Yeah, I think that's fair.
We'll discover how weird.
Yeah, who wants to go first this time? I don't know. We haven't run their numbers on the statistics of who...
If there's a numerical advantage to going first.
No.
Maybe it's like the Eurovision Song Contest, you know? I think the songs in the back half of the Eurovision tend to do better because they're in people's minds.
Yeah, is it like first or last? Although each of us get either first or last, so you would hope that people remember both of them. But we'll see.
I think I went first last time. If you'd like to...
I'm genuinely really nervous about this one because I'm trying to think, I'm trying to sort of pre-form the words to explain why I did what I did. And I can't really remember now. One of the crucial elements of it.
I don't know why, because it's not to do with the game. I guess it was just how I was feeling.
You sound like you've just been summoned to the headmaster's office.
Listen, Scott Marston was there when the review was and I just wanted to join in because I wanted to be his friend.
I didn't think it would let me in.
I'm really sorry. How do I begin to explain this? I think the profound sense that I had from playing this game was of it's an unwinnable war, right?
It's, and particularly when I'm in charge of it. And I'd also made the mistake of naming. I was excited about the idea of naming my squad, but I only named you, Jeremy.
I didn't name anybody else. This led to a very, I would like give a disproportionate amount of attention and care to Jeremy Peel. Whereas like, Victor Nabokov or whoever else was in the squad.
Like they were just some pixels that I could use to clear out the aliens. But like it was crucial to keep Jeremy alive.
So, is this a you or a J?
So, but also I'm not very good at the game. So I didn't keep you alive. And really that's as much, that's as close as I can get to ever explaining why I sat down as a grown man at 36 one evening and recorded the following.
Dear Jeremy, hello, it's me.
Listen, I'm sorry after all these years that you've become dead meat. I tried, well, everything. They say that med kits are supposed to heal you, but you ain't done much healing.
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in Phil's lovely base one, dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger. And three, I've forgotten how it felt before the graves fell at our feet. There's such a difference, you know, between us and a million miles.
Hello from the other side.
I must have loaded honestly a thousand saves to save you from squawking and getting fried by a gun. But when I reload, I don't know, and you always seem to catch one.
I mean, do you know what? At least I can say I've tried. To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your head.
The aliens can't tell you apart anymore. Can they? Moving.
Moving stuff.
Yeah, if only Adele had thought to release that song as special work, she could have had a real hit on her hands, couldn't she?
Missed opportunity there. It just weighed heavy on my mind, Jeremy, that I'd let you die and I needed to get that out somehow. And listen, it doesn't make perfect sense.
Why would I know the words to a song in the 90s that wouldn't release for another 15 years yet? Why would I use that in the opening of a review in the 90s? None of these questions have easy answers.
I just needed to get it off my chest.
Yeah, we don't worry about such things in reviews.
Imagine if I had, though. A very small group of people who read that review in the 90s. Do you remember that really strange review of XCOM, where he wasted 300 words on that weird eulogy to his mate?
Aren't the words of that dead similar to this song that's now in the charts 25 years later? No, we really spun people's heads.
Yeah, the secret gaming roots of Adele's writing. It's like when you find out that Now You're Gone by Bass Hunter was originally about League of Legends.
Yeah, right. It's got a song about Dota as well.
The only lyric that I know is Dota.
So I can't. How did I die, Phil?
Oh, loads of times, mate, to be honest.
The first time, I just didn't realize that you were still sort of... One of the aliens had a line of sight on you and I'd run out of time points, so I couldn't get you kneeling or anything like that. You were just stood in a field, mate, and you just cracked it.
So, sorry about that.
I do appreciate you. I appreciate you, you know, the remembrance. Thank you.
It's dead strange, isn't it? What a thing to have made. So, vote for that if you like it, or the sensible choice.
I can't help but feel, though, towards the end that you started blaming me. There was a moment there where you're talking about reloading all your saves and there's just a little exasperation and you seem to be suggesting that I wasn't a good soldier and that maybe that was why I was dead and that that was an inconvenience to you.
Well, listen, I was really railroaded by Adele's sentiments at particular points in that song and I think there's still a bit of Adele there between her and her ex. I had to reflect that. Tell me about yours then, Jeremy.
I mean, it can't be as strange as that, can it?
It's...
It's much more bloated than yours.
OK, good.
The be here now to your definitely maybe.
Does it begin with a helicopter?
Yeah, we'll see whether that goes down as well with listeners. Oasis' famously disastrous third album, Dead.
I actually love that album. I particularly like All My People, with all the helicopters swirling around. I think it's fantastic.
OK, well, maybe that bodes well for my review of.
Yeah. OK, is that all we're hearing about it? Are we just getting into it?
I'm sorry, I don't know how to explain this.
Okay, well, this is Jeremy's review, well then.
What are the letters in XCOM stand for? The extracurricular courting of monsters? The excessive calculation of moves?
Excommunicate chrysalids on missions? Honestly, you can get as wrong as you want with it, because XCOM isn't the acronym you should be worrying about. The acronym you should be worrying about is FOMO.
This is a game about staring out across a green, blue globe, hitting fast forward while your research unfolds, and wondering what your enemies are doing with all this time. Worrying that you're not doing enough? How many UFOs are slipping by undetected?
What unreported horrors are taking place out there? The aliens are out of sight, but they're not out of mind. In fact, they're preparing to control your mind.
Even once you've shot down a UFO, the battlefield holds more questions than answers. The fog of war is close and thick, and you won't see your opponents until they can see you. Who knows what shape they'll take this time.
XCOM is all about facing your fear of the unknown. Enemy is unknown.
But what's the other thing they say about enemies? That you should know them. That's a duty we take very seriously here at XCOM, dragging dead aliens back home to base to dissect and eventually understand them.
We may not know what our name stands for, but we know how to slowly turn the tables. Eventually, the aliens will be feeling the FOMO, not us.
Right, we're not doing Review Wars anymore. That's the last Review Wars, everyone. All right, we'll do Monkey News or something next week.
Oh, that was too much.
I knew I'd lost from the first, eggs come. It didn't even matter that in between that sandwich, there was like a typically brilliant bit of Jeremy Peel review writing that does actually function as a fantastic review intro and is full of insight, annoyingly as usual. But like you could have just filled that with silence and it still would win based on the eggs come and then the suck at the end.
Well done, mate.
I started from S Club 7 and extracted the, it became a sort of War of the Worlds thing from there, which I imagine is how it went for S Club in the studio as well.
I think it was the opposite way for them, wasn't it? I think they were listening to a lot of Jeff Wayne and how can we get this into a sort of tight three minutes 30? Someone just went, yeah, they just went from there.
Yeah, I mean, it is very indulgent. The dramatic pacing, I worried was a little much. There's a point in the middle where you're like, oh, is he done?
Oh, no, he's still going. He's still going.
There was actually, because there's a dramatic pause. But fortunately, little did we know, we were mere seconds away from S Club 7.
You thought that a minute and a half was an appropriate length of this. No, we're only halfway there.
Well, fair play, mate. That's another Review Wars one.
I don't know, I think, you know, I'm there saying XCOM is this and that. And I think you're right that it's an anecdote generator. And you've captured the anecdote part of it, which is the thing I've not touched on at all.
To be honest, I would worry for the people who vote for me. I would worry this week. I worry about what's going on in their lives and why that resonated.
I think it was a very moving tribute to me.
Well, thank you very much. Well, vote with your clicking fingers or in your swipes. Samuel usually puts the poll live in the days immediately after this podcast goes live.
Yeah, on Twitter.
So keep an eye out there on Twitter and get your votes in. Well, what left us there to say?
RIP.
I suppose we should talk about XCOM a little bit more. Well, as ever, we've been playing it in the modern day to contrast against our original memories of it. Although in my case, I had none.
I had zero original memories of it. It's just the first time playing the original. So really, XCOM to me was the Jake Solomon variety that rebooted in 2012.
Yeah, I'd forgotten that I'd thrown you into this, that you didn't have any prior history. Although, and let me know if you think this is bollocks, but I feel that the reboot of XCOM teaches you how to play the original, certainly better than the original does. Like it tells you what your priorities should be, that you should be, research is super important and that you should be trying to shoot down as many UFOs as possible and have as many fights as possible.
And try and upgrade your troops so that you've got some some sturdier ones. Yeah, what do you reckon?
I find that edifying because that is where I placed my focus. The very first thing that I did was buy more scientists and then got them researching, you know, med kits and laser pistols, whatever the first things are. And yeah, and I was going after, because I just didn't want to...
South America was just getting absolutely battered on the graphs and I was like, something bad's going on in there. I didn't have a base there yet. I couldn't afford to build a new base.
So I was just routinely going out to South America for these scraps, Jeremy Peel and his no name mates against the greys. But it didn't stand me in fantastic footing. I guess it would have been worse if I hadn't have done that.
But yeah, also, yeah, there's no tutorial. I mean, this was the days when people read the manuals, I guess. And there's a bit of a like XCOM Cyclopedia, whatever they call it, the UFOpedia.
That explains a few key concepts. But in terms of how to play the game, what do I click on when I'm looking at this geoscape? There's nothing.
So it was only the 2012 XCOM that I had. And I guess some like Into the Breach and other modern XCOM clones that I had as a frame of reference. So it was quite scary actually to be thrown into that monumental task without much of a steer at all.
Yeah, it is really rough and as someone who, you know, I consider myself a fan of this genre, I'm all right at it. I've completed modern XCOM games. I'm still like an idiot child when I play this.
I can't. I'm losing scores of soldiers on the regular and falling foul of like a stupid action point mistakes like I'll set on the option that means they won't move further than, you know, they'll still reserve enough points for me to fire up a spray of bullets. But then when I try to do the spray of bullets, I'll actually turn my soldier 45 degrees, which uses a minute point of his action move bar, which means he then can't shoot and he's just stood there.
Yeah, the number of times I've been, yeah, I've been stood there like three feet away from an alien pointing a gun at him. And it's taken all my time points to get there. So I just have to stand there.
And then, of course, they're absolutely dead. Like, because the next round, an alien is just like looking at somebody three feet away from them, like, all right, well, I'll just shoot you then.
Yeah, they can't miss. Yeah. And I had one recently, even when I was doing better, and I primed a grenade.
I got my best soldiers a primer grenade as we entered the UFO, and they didn't quite have enough points to throw it. It doesn't explode in his hands. But if they drop it in any way, then obviously it will go off.
And he was then shot the next turn and surrounded by my own troops. And it was a mess. It was a mess, Phil.
I don't mind telling you.
It's a real like push-pull, it's a tug of war between patience and like just wanting to complete the mission because you've got this grander plan in mind and like winning this battle is just a tiny little piece of the puzzle. But the only way really to win the battle is to be incredibly patient and like to just always be behind cover and always have people like looking at the right angles and always be thinking a couple of moves ahead. Let let them sort of step out a little bit and take the risk.
And I'm not a very patient player in any games that I play at all, with the exception perhaps of championship manager like Chapman 3, where I'll perfectly happily just like quietly assemble a good squad over four or five seasons and take the 14th place finish. But in any other game, I get bored.
Yeah, it's a real test, isn't it, because so much of a battle is spent wandering around the map, not being sure where the enemies are. And on the one hand, that's very tense. On the other hand, it's hard to maintain your state of constant alertness because you think, well, they're probably not around this next corner.
There are 20 more corners that I'm going to have to sweep around to find these aliens. But then they often see you before you see them and you really pay for that.
Yeah, it's when you get into the ship, right? The buildup of the battle when you're walking through some fields or farmhouses or whatever, you can still lose soldiers there, but it's a bit easier to be cautious because you can still make a lot of ground and feel like you're getting somewhere because you're getting closer to the ship. Once you're on the ship, you do have to check every single corner because there's an unknown number of aliens there and fighting in close quarters is absolutely the hardest thing about this game, right?
They just always seem to be facing the right way whenever you come up against them. Also it took me quite a long time to figure out how to open the doors and where the doors were. So I had eight people just sort of completely surrounding the spaceship trying to shoot various windows and things and then I realized that you just have to sort of click inside from where there is...
They're very subtle. Yeah, the exact same cause as the rest of the ship. They just got a little sort of hint of a gap around the outside, like the mouth of the marionette stall or something.
Yeah, it's a little depression, but you hear it going, don't you? Like when the aliens are doing their hidden turns, you just hear a lot of like...
Yeah, that's quite useful, actually, isn't it?
Oh, there's a ship somewhere and they're in it or on it. Yes. But yeah, I've never played a tactics game that takes light of sight so seriously.
Yeah, like, particularly when you're on the ships, it's not uncommon to... Because on some level, you think you're seeing the room, right? You think you're seeing everything.
You go into a room and you can see the chairs and the little consoles with the little lights dancing on them. But then towards the end of your turn, you turn to your right and you discover there was an alien stood between those chairs the whole time. And literally, they could be a few feet away from you.
And you just hadn't had someone look in that specific direction, which on one level is unnecessarily cruel. But it's also definitely lends to the genuine terror that this game is infused with.
And it lends to the storytelling as well, right? Because if everybody survived every mission and the challenge was always manageable and there weren't any casualties of war, it wouldn't actually tell a very good player generated story, would it? You would just steamroll through a bunch of combat encounters.
Your research and equipment harvesting would be like totally linear, like you would just be better and better throughout the game. But actually it's a much more compelling story that like you might lose an entire base or you might lose, as I did, every single soldier. And then that really hamstrings you, and then you just have to let a few UFO spottings go.
And you think, well, that's on my conscience now, you know? I don't know where they've gone or what havoc they've wrought, but that's on me because I messed up the last one. So ultimately I think it's for the better that it is a real challenge and elements of it are a real mystery because if you ever do even achieve something semi-competent, then it feels all the more rewarding.
And, you know, because you know how easy it is to lose and like how damaging and far reaching the consequences of losing a battle are. So for example, I didn't realize that you leave behind your sky ranger. If all your troops are killed in a battle, then the ship is just obviously there's no one to pilot the ship back to your base, so you lose that as well.
And that's like, oh, it's a good few hundred thousand to replace.
I think it's like four hundred thousand dollars or something like that. It's enormous. And XCOM teaches you to think in utilitarian terms, doesn't it?
It's like, well, a soldier is maybe forty K.
Yeah, that's ten soldiers down there.
After we talked about this losing sky rangers on WhatsApp, I started a new policy of just having a guy who stayed with the ship at all times.
Smart.
And so, you know, if it all goes wrong, he can at least fly away by himself.
That's what I should have done with Jeremy Peel. He should have been my sky ranger preservation officer.
Yeah, I would have been happy with that role, honestly. Just sort of like knocking around the sort of corrugated steel floor, making fun noises with it, and listening to the screams of my colleagues and going, oof, I'm going to have a lot to talk about with my therapist.
Give me a solo ride home. It reminds me a bit of Phasmophobia, the way that those missions start with everybody on the spaceship just standing there. I wonder if Phasmophobia is directly influenced by that, the way that you bundle out of a van with a torch and whatever else supernatural equipment.
You know what it reminds me of? Medal of Honor's D-Day landings.
Oh, okay.
And there's a little sort of band of brothers as well in just the filing, especially near the beginning of the game, you're just filing a bunch of guys out of the ship and watching a few of them go down as the aliens just take pot shots at you as you try desperately to find cover. It's absolutely brutal.
Harrowing, isn't it?
Eventually you learn to use stuff like, as a matter of course now, I throw a smoke grenade out of the ship before anyone gets off and then once that goes off, I use a motion scanner to see if there's any immediate activity. I still muck up all the time, but you develop these little strategies that help you through certain ways, like enter a UFO, things like that, the way you end up sort of stacking people up, like in a Rainbow Six or something like that, to try and make sure that you can get a few shots in once somebody goes through the door of the UFO, knowing there's probably a couple of aliens on the other side. But yeah, it's really hard.
But yeah, that prospect of genuine failure is kind of like, I don't know, I suppose you get a similar feeling in some roguelikes and stuff like that. But to play a game that takes place over this sort of length of time, tens of hours, and have the prospect of real failure, which you still get in the modern X-Con games. And I love that about them, that you could play 30, 40 hours and end up just kind of doing the shit badly and not be able to correct course is, on the one hand, obviously pretty upsetting if that happens.
But what it gives you is a real sense of genuinely fighting for your life, which is quite different to most games in which they're dedicated to giving you the impression of doing that when you know on some level, well, this is sort of designed to help me get to the end. Yeah, and XCOM really doesn't feel like that. You know, when you get through to the end of one of those terror missions, which are absolutely horrific, the ones where they land a big UFO in a city, and early on, like, you have no chance of intercepting those UFOs, they're too powerful, so you just sort of have to wait for them to land in an urban center and then follow them and try and clear out all the aliens.
And you end up seeing something like, what do I describe to you, there's like a... Like a...
A giant pug.
12 foot 4, pug, yeah. I think it's called a reaper terrorist or something like that, but you don't know that until you, you know, you bring a body home and research it, you think, what the hell is that? And, and hopefully you manage to get a couple of soldiers through by the skin of your teeth, save a couple of civilians, but then you've got this UFO and you guys bring all, all of the stuff back.
They're very meticulous, aren't they? Like, if there are survivors, they will bring about all the equipment from the bodies of their mates, which must be quite a sad task, I imagine, and they bring about every single like gun and navigation system and what have you from the enemy ship. And then on those moments, they could be real breakthroughs.
You're like, oh, I've got five new things to research. And suddenly, like, I've got plasma weapons. And although guys are still dying a lot, like we have turned a corner.
And I think that's all connected to the massive, massive potential loss. They're sitting there with you constantly playing this game.
Yeah, so rare that a modern game would do it. And I think the only reason that the modern XCOM reboots or reimaginings still allow you to, as you say, steer the ship so badly wrong that you sort of sneak it after 30 hours of a campaign is because it's so inherent to that original design. I don't think otherwise any modern release would dare do that to you.
But it is absolutely crucial to your level of investment and the feeling of accomplishment that you get from even the smallest victory, because you know that it's not like it would have been a win or neutral. It's like it could have been a win or it could have been basically the end of your campaign. So that's always very effective.
And I don't tend to play games like that because I find it really stressful. You know how difficult it is to sit with AD in isolation over however long it is, I guess like getting on for 20 hours. I've had that same sensation here, it's like it's tremendously atmospheric and like the soundtrack, given that it's like it's MIDI files playing over DOS, the soundtrack's really good and like creates quite a foreboding atmosphere that again fills you with this existential dread and that perhaps everything you're doing is futile ultimately and that you're up against a far superior force.
Yeah, yeah. What do you think of like, so the modern XCOMs, they did a smart thing by, they kind of took all the choices which are there in this game, but they made them explicit. So you would be sat there on your geoscape and it would go, some cities are being attacked, you can only go to one of them.
They present you with often a choice of three things and you tackle one of them, which I think is really effective because, you know, as any explicit difficult choice is, a Sophie's choice as the listeners might put it, whereas in this game, it's much more systemic or sort of purely systemic where you do have those situations where like, oh, there's two UFOs wheeling around and I can only send out one interceptor because the other one's in repairs and stuff like that. But what I think Foraxis did was manage to take those moments and make sure that everyone had them and everyone noticed them. I don't know.
I'm curious what you think about that stuff.
I missed a lot of those things being made explicit. Yeah, I think it lends itself better to the atmosphere in the original that you don't have anybody helping you along the way. Doesn't feel like you've got offices below you being like, sir, this has happened.
And I just wondered if you'd noticed. I'm sure you did. But just so you know, three cities are currently being absolutely ravaged.
Yeah, I missed it. But I think what I missed more is just knowing, getting like a clear numerical readout or like a clear something on the UI to let me know that I was in cover. So you know, I would take a knee in this original thinking like, well, I'm probably safe, but I don't really know.
And like, it looks like I've got that doorway covered, but I might not. Yeah. And it's all just guesswork.
So what I missed was like, the UI elements and the, that make that clear in modern XCOM that like, yes, you are in cover now. This is exactly what your guy can see. If anything comes, you know, into this cone of vision, he's going to shoot.
Yeah. And it will be exactly this many points. You can see that sort of depleting on your action points.
Whereas you just have to know, you have to play it enough times to figure out what everything costs and then do all the maths in your head and then plan out, plan out your turn in this original and just sort of hope that it all goes OK. Which I don't know, we're talking about it all these years later and the reboots wouldn't be around if it wasn't for that formula being so effective and capturing the imagination of so many gamers. So, you know, I'm loathe to say that there's anything wrong with it.
Yeah.
But it's still very effective.
Let's not be overly nostalgic about it. I've had many of those moments, you Scrag, where you think you're behind cover and then the guy gets hit anyway and you just think, well, fuck you then.
It's really painful when you feel like you're doing everything. When you are being careful. When you're not being careful and you get a soldier killed, you're like, fair, OK.
But when you are and they manage to fire straight through the tiny farmhouse window from ten hundred paces anyway, you think, ugh, yeah, life's hard enough, why am I doing this? Yeah, so the elements of that, which are just 1994 coming back to buyers, I think, and the fact that no games were play tested in that era.
Yeah, it's just whatever the designer reckoned, which probably explains why the difficulty is so insanely like I'm playing on beginner, right? And that's still way too hard for me. And there's three or maybe even four difficulty settings above that.
And I think you were telling me earlier in the week that that there's a glitch in the original games code that means that it's it always defaults to begin and no matter which you pick, it's still way too hard and I guess that's just what you know, if Julian Gollett's been living this game for the duration of its development, then it will seem quite easy to him on beginner because he understands all the systems implicitly. I think it took him three years. Three years, was it?
An eternity in early 90s game dev, isn't it?
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So they would have had no conception of how hard the game was.
Have you ever had chance to take him to task with this? Because you've interviewed him at least once, haven't you?
Yeah, I don't think I've ever told him off for how hard it was. I did take Martin Edmondson of the Driver Games to task specifically for that brutal driver tutorial in the garage.
The original tutorial, yeah.
And his explanation was just that.
It's unskippable as well, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah. You can't play the game.
You have to do that before you can get the first mission.
You can't play the game unless you pass this sort of gauntlet of 360s and kind of whizzing around pillows in an underground car park at 60 miles an hour. But yeah, his admission with that was very much like, yeah, we didn't have play testers. That wasn't a thing back then.
Yeah, so go back a few years more and yeah, even less likely that anyone would have any sort of outside perspective on the difficulty of it. Well, I know that you have spoken to Julian Gollop before, Jeremy, so I've prepared a special little segment for this episode, which I'm calling Jewel Never Believe It.
That's good because Jewel's is short for Julian, right?
That's right. This is the concept. I have found some Julian Gollop quotes and recorded them.
I have also interspersed them with some red herrings. These are quotes from Julian Barrett of The Mighty Boosh and other comedy vehicles such as Nathan Barley, he's very good at that, and also the Strokes frontman Julian Casablanca. They are three of the most eminent Julians around.
The challenge is to correctly identify whether it was Julian Gollop, the saying, the quote, or one of the other Julians, and to make it even more difficult, I've introduced sound elements from contrasting Julians so that it might sound like a Strokes song or it might sound like it's from The Mighty Boosh, but it could be Julian Gollop. Do you understand? It's quite difficult to explain.
Yeah, I think we're there.
Okay.
Yeah. Jewel?
Never believe it. Okay, Jeremy, are you ready for me to run the jewels?
Yeah, do it.
This is Jewel 1.
Julian One, what's your guess? Who was that? Was that Julian Barrett?
Was that Julian Casablanca? Or was that Julian Gollop?
Well, you have thrown me off because that was very clearly in the style of Julian Casablanca of New York, of the Strokes, and is very distinctive.
How do you describe the vocal production on those early Strokes records? Tinney?
Well, I would say it's like Lou Reed singing through a guitar distortion pedal.
Yeah, singing through a can of beans. Yeah. So that really did feel like I was listening to him.
And that's a song off of what? This Is It, their first album, maybe.
I believe it's from First Impressions of Earth. The music is from Heart in a Cage, yeah. But I feel like you're stalling.
Well, I heard the words Hampstead Heath, and that sealed it for me. I don't think that Julian Casabancas would sing about Hampstead Heath. And I don't think Julian Golop would talk about it either.
So I'm going with Barrett of The Boosh.
You are correct. You're one for one so far. That was Julian Barrett in a 2021 interview with The Guardian, talking about himself.
I think that was where he would spend a Sunday, ideally. Right. So he would like to be off somewhere exotic, but he just tends to stroll about Hampstead Heath.
Yeah. That's quite a boring interview question, isn't it?
He did the best with what he was given. Let me just check whether Duel 2 is another Strokes one, because I don't want to. Yeah, it is, right.
Let me just check in with Duel 2.
Are you ready? Oh, I should have known a Jules Holland one. Why didn't I think of that?
Introducing all the other Juleses.
Ladies and gentlemen, X-Com 2.
Fantastic. It's got to be... Turb-based strategy.
It's fantastic.
There we go. He's in the room.
Right. OK, I'm going to run the next Jule. Are you ready?
Mm-hmm.
One by one, ticking time bombs one. It's not the secrets or the government keeping you down. No, it's the other way around.
Wait, what's that sound? One by one, baby. Here they come.
Which Jule was that?
Was that Julian Casablanca's? Was it Julian Gollop or was it Julian Barron's?
It's a bleak tone for Julian Gollop to adopt in interviews. That's the only time when I hear him speak.
They're very draining, though, those press days. Let's not forget, you've got nine or ten hours of interview slots with people like us just asking you inane questions.
He doesn't have a Yorkshire accent either, but then none of these Julien's do. I'm going to go with Casablanca's because that sounds like a song lyric to me. I mean, the Boosh Doodoo songs, but I'm going to go with Casablanca's.
You've gone for Casablanca's final answer. You are correct, that was Julian Casablanca's. That was a lyric from The End Has No End, which I'd cleverly disguised to make sound like it could have been a Mighty Boosh skit.
Yeah, it had a sort of like...
That was my best Howard Moon impression.
Beetles-y, whimsy to it, didn't it? It was very like, very boosh. Yeah, it was good that.
Okay, let's run the next duel. Are you ready?
I'm ready.
My dream Sunday lunch is a giant curry with all the trimmings, preferably in a vat with a bendy straw. I grew up in Leeds and we've got some of the best Indian food in the land up there. I'd scoff it all down before a tea with two tea bags and a custard pie to finish.
Which straw was it?
I'd be really surprised if Julian Casablanca was born in Leeds. That's not part of the Strokes mythology at all. Yeah, founding member of the Kaiser Chiefs, surprisingly.
I'm going to say that although cleverly disguised with XCOM soundtrack and sort of combined with a sort of Booshian voice, I think it is Julian Barrett. I think it's from that very same Guardian interview asking him very domestic questions about his life.
You're absolutely spot on. That's once again Julian Barrett from the same Guardian interview. I think that was about favorite food or Sunday lunch or something, if you're interested.
We've got one more duel. Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Let's run the final duel.
What's that? What's that?
I can't believe how good that was. You're much better at producing stroke strikes than I am at producing Esquip 7. Oh my god.
I'd say that's Julian Gollop, and I'll go further if you'll allow me. I think that's Julian Gollop speaking about Phoenix Point, his more recent Xcoma-like.
Oh, you're good at this. You are good at running the jewels. That was indeed Julian Gollop talking about Phoenix Point and the crabby-like archetypes within that game.
So there we go. I feel like I've sort of reduced this show down to a local radio station now with that segment. But sometimes a pun appears in your head and you've just got to see it through to its conclusion.
Absolutely. And that was that. So, you know, a bit of a weird non-secretary.
Very enjoyable. Very good.
Did you have anything else you wanted to talk about in the field of XCOM or should we don our wigs and take it to 90s Games Court?
I think I'm happy to move on.
OK. This is a big moment. So standing before us is the 1994 famously difficult turn-based tactics management game XCOM UFO Defense, also known as Enemy Unknown.
It has an alias. So that tells you a little bit about its criminal behavior in the past.
This is the one that I'm so, as we've said, every previous game we've absolutely just acquitted and they've flown through 90s Games Court and it's just been a bit of a non-event. I'm not sure about this one. I'm less sure about it because as I've said, I really found myself missing elements of modern XCOM.
Just total revisionist history because all those bits that I like, they had the benefit of building on this brilliant established game. But at the same time, what do I actually prefer playing right now? What do I get more out of?
So I'm not sure yet. I'm genuinely not sure whether I want to acquit this one or drag it over the coals for being so hard on me and punishing me in so many ways over the last week. How are you feeling about it?
Are you pro or anti at this stage?
Famously reviews at the time said that it was good, but they could envision a 2012 version of the formula, which really sort of boiled down those elements and made them cleaner and more effective. I think you can definitely still kind of come to love this game. I think it's hard work.
I think the magic of XCOM is all there in this, which is amazing. It's what for AXIS drew on. I wouldn't say I condemn it to death, but I would recommend, rather than play this, the listeners play Phoenix Point, the more recent Julian Gollop game, because that builds on the sort of polished foundations of the XCOM reboot.
Takes a lot of cues from that, but it brings forward like an awful lot of the sort of granularity that this original game has, that freedom to have a pool of time points and do what you want with them and it has that kind of, you can aim shots very specifically and do all these very kind of minute things which allow you to achieve very particular results. Like that's all there in Phoenix Point, but it's much more accessible. And also the overworld in that is really good.
Like Gollop more recently, inspired by his brother Nick, has got more into the Forex ground strategy side of things. And Phoenix Point has a really strong like strategic layer to it, where you have these different factions as well as the encroaching crustacean men who are spreading as a kind of red mist across the globe. And these factions all have their own ideologies and agendas and they will, they're standing with each other, changes over time.
They're standing with you, changes over time. Sometimes they'll declare war with each other or with you. And all of those factors just lead to a really sort of like deep and kind of mesmerizing version of XCOM, where it feels like you're engaging more with the, you know, an active world rather than in the for axis XCOM games, you know, a world that is more like a sort of a ball game.
It's waiting to present you with certain challenges and choices very effectively. But I'd say if you want to feel like, you know, what a gollum XCOM is like, play Phoenix Point rather than this today, I would say.
Sounds like a strong recommendation. That's piqued my interest. I think I'm still trying to weigh up whether I want to arrive at the prosecution or the defense for it.
And I think what it has going for it, like when I first launched this, this was the first of the games in this series that I played on a modern PC, because again, my old beige machine upstairs is running Windows 98, and it would just be really tricky to get this running. So I just loaded up the Steam version and it worked perfectly. And from the intro cut scene, it was so evocative.
And again, because I've got these imaginings in my head from reading games writers in the 90s talking about their experiences with XCOM. When I do see, like, for example, like when you first get into a city, like an urban environment, and you're not just like, you know, it's not just a farmer's field and the spaceship in the middle of it. That's so much more evocative to me than anything that happens in modern XCOM.
Like, with the greatest respect to that game, which is brilliant. I do feel like the sense of place is all a bit secondary.
Yeah.
And quite by accident with the passage of time and having heard so much about the original, something a little bit magical about every new bit that you're allowed to see, because it's also hard for, and as you say, like when you see a 12-foot pug, strolling about, that's like incredibly evocative, because it's almost like you're getting one over on the game by getting this far and seeing these new pixels. And so that's the sort of indefinable magic, which can't really be put down to the design or the challenge or anything. It's probably just pure nostalgia, but that is in my head and it makes me feel like it would be very harsh to condemn this game, which not only is like mechanically pretty imperious and defined an entire genre, but is also benefits from this incredible sense of magic and nostalgia in my head.
I don't think I can prosecute Jeremy. I'm probably on the defence again. Are we ever going to prosecute any games in 90s games court?
I don't know.
Probably not, as long as we're picking games that we have a deep fondness for. Although you didn't with this one. So yeah, I think it's definitely a game that's more than the sum of its parts, like the atmosphere of it and even down to like the AI, which Gollop has said, you know, parts of the AI of this game are just aliens programmed to choose to wander randomly.
But as a player, you kind of read that as like an unknowable intelligence. And everything seems to work towards this sense of enemies unknown, like a real, like working to understand something horrifying and out of this world and just the satisfaction of getting a handle on some of it and then leveraging it against those enemies that never gets old. So, yeah, I can't condemn it for those reasons.
I think we have yet another acquittal in 90s Games Court, the most forgiving court in the land.
Yet another non-event. The court reports are going to stop showing up, I think.
Oh, man, well, I think that's for the best because it's a pretty treasured game after all this time and it's not always been very easy to play. There was a few years there from the late 90s to probably around when the XCOM reboot came out when it would have been really difficult to play. OpenXCOM, an open source sort of fan reproduction of the original does make it a bit easier to play and it also addresses that difficulty glitch.
I mean, why would you ever want to address that? Of all the sort of happy accidents out there, I think that's...
More games should have that feature to let you believe that you're playing on a higher difficulty when actually you're not.
That would be great, wouldn't it? If Halo... I've always really sort of fetishized finishing things on the hardest difficulty in Halo games and I would have...
I'm sure I'd be just as happy if it would have defaulted back to Rookie, but it felt like I'd done it all on Legendary. So yeah, so perhaps fiddle around with OpenXCOM if you're really interested in the original and you consider yourself a bit of an expert and you want to test your skills even further on the higher difficulty levels. So that's another episode in the books.
Thank you all very much for your continued listening. Sorry for putting you through. You will never believe it.
I wonder what we'll come up with for the next episode.
Yeah, I think there's some enthusiasm for pun-based features in the Discord. So I think reception will be at worst makes, or we can hope for in this game.
Well, the next episode is going to be maybe the most controversial we've done in the series. It's going to be Jurassic Park Trespasser. I'm really, really looking forward to it.
It could be one of the most incendiary 90s games courts we've ever had.
We're going to be testing the limits of our public rehabilitation program.
Absolutely. Does the system work? So join us for that.
That will be coming out in March and we'll no doubt have some absolute nonsense based on puns we think of around Jurassic Park Trespasser. So until then, thank you very much. Have a lovely few weeks until we next speak to you.
We'll catch you in the next episode. Bye-bye.
Bye. Bye.
There ain't no party like an X-Gun party. Oh, everybody get down tonight.
There ain't no party like an X-Gun party. Oh, movie party from side to side.
