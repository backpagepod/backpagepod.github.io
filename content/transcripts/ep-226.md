Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Mailbag. A video games podcast. I confused myself and didn't know where to go next, Matthew.
I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. So, this is a mailbag. Before we get into the questions from the listeners, of which there are many, thank you for people who dropped those in.
We have loads of questions from our Discord pod questions channel. I probably missed some from the backpagegames.gmail.com inbox, to be honest, but hey-ho, plenty from the Discord anyway. I was going to ask you, before we get started, have you seen Sinners yet?
I haven't, but I'm kind of piecing it together based on little memes and nods as you can in this day and age. I keep hearing the word Riverdance.
I mean, there's definitely one section that covers that, that is flatly adjacent, I would say.
Flatly adjacent!
Yes, I sort of like, my girlfriend who is half Irish, I just turned to her and she was like, she's just like, I'm such a shame that, you know, that, that dance is so closely linked with my people that people still see us through the prism of this dance. But that really is like 1% of the film, if that's just so it doesn't colour your judgement too much. But will you just be piecing it together from memes in lieu of actually participating?
No, we'll go and catch it this week. We were going to see it at the weekend, but I was feeling incredibly lazy. And you know, so didn't do it.
Not a great anecdote.
Fair enough. The Castle family didn't need to go to Bath because they had the cursed town in Kaizen Game Works' Promise Mascot Agency to keep it busy. Am I correct in my assessment there of your weekend?
Yes, we've both been playing Promise Mascot Agency, a game to which I now own my biggest blue sky success.
Yeah, like Jeff Keighley, Borgon tweet, eat your heart out.
Yeah, I did not think it would be a Promise Mascot Agency that finally brought me some modicum of celebrity on blue sky. Yeah, but I finished over the weekend, had a really good time with it. Immensely chill, bombing around that island in my little lorry plane, so that was fun.
Yeah, when this episode is over. Well, I've got to play Metro Prime Remastered for our next Patreon episode, but I will be adding an hour of Promise Mascot Agency time a day for a bit of decompressing from it all. So yes, you and I, I feel like we've been drawn into the battle of turning Promise Mascot Agency into a hit.
Do you know what I mean? We've been enlisted somehow. Your meme is the last, that's it now.
There's no turning back. We're part of this battle. Is that happened, do you think?
Yeah, a little bit. I mean, it's got a lot of supporters and a lot of people coming out, you know, kind of clearly love it. So, you know, I feel like we're part of a pretty healthy army behind this one.
Yeah.
Which is good because it's a, you know, it's a quite a weird thing at heart. And it heartens me to see that lots of other people chime with it.
Yeah, absolutely. OK. Well, that's some some some general notes on what's going on.
But this is a mailbag and we have loads of questions, Matthew. So let's get to it, I suppose. Do you want to read out this first one?
As the foremost Bath-based Bond game and film ranking podcast, Amazon have decided to give you the reins to produce the new Bond film. Yeah, of course, it makes perfect sense. Who do you cast as Bond and director?
What direction do you take the film? And what Back Page podcast themed stunt or gadget is essential?
So this is the question to which I did the least preparation, because I told myself, oh, that's quite hard, actually. I'll come back to this when I've got better ideas than I never had better ideas, and here we are now. So that's not ideal.
I just basically wrote down director Paul Greengrass. Actor, I would do, I think I would go with Dev Patel if you're doing it in the modern age. If you're doing like a kind of 60s riff, which I feel like is maybe possible for, you know how Britain's really embarrassing now.
And so the idea of pretending we're like at the forefront of spy stuff is like preposterous and no one really buys it because we're such a post-Brexit slump with a shite Prime Minister excuse of a country. Do you know what I mean? We're just, there's like nothing to get excited about with the UK.
It's just basically just anti-trans shit island.
So you're saying Bond can't be a contemporary film?
Well, I'm just saying that like, is it, what is the exciting angle of doing it in contemporary UK? You kind of have to riff on either stuff that the Britain's done in the past. I was thinking, could you do something kind of like where, a really high concept thing where like some sort of like British spinter cell takes back Hong Kong from the Chinese or something and causes some kind of like international riff that way.
But I don't really know what the plot is. That's just basically like a kind of idea. The other like high concept thing I had was what if like the new James Bond basically has to go back and kill all the old ones to earn the name?
And it's that kind of like theory that James Bond is a title that's passed down as opposed to the actual one. That's a bit too smart for Bond. It really just needs to be quite a straightforward spy thriller.
But yeah, I don't know if like Paul Greengrass is really in the headspace to mount these kind of films anymore. He's getting a bit older and those Bond films were quite a long time ago. But he is obviously very accomplished.
Green's on the side, which is a duff film. But yeah, and he's British. I guess I was thinking along those lines.
I didn't want it to be like John Wick guy. But then, you know, I'm not saying the British thing has to be a deal breaker. But yeah, Dev Patel was who came to mind as like, oh, that's someone who I feel like could do the action, could do that quite muscular action.
I mean, I saw him doing it in that film Monkey Man last year. And he's just like really intense when he needs to be. Just really good.
Just saw him in something recently. What was it? It was maybe like that Wes Anderson Netflix thing with Benedict Cumberbatch.
He was in that very briefly. And yeah.
Can you sugar?
Yeah, that's right. So that might be why he's sort of front of mind for me. What did you come up with Matthew?
Well, I thought director-wise I actually went with Bong Joon-ho, which would trigger lots of very tiresome Bond Joon-ho puns in film magazines.
The Sun would definitely go with that.
Yeah. But I think he'd be good at it because he's very good at artfully filming like the World of the Rich. You know, like the house from Parasite has sort of Bond layer energy to it.
So I think he could make the cool sleep bits look very cool. But he's also quite good at embedding himself in any environment he's in. He's pretty good at the action as well, like when we re-watched Snowpiercer.
I was like, this is actually pretty decent, some of the fight choreography and everything. He's got the right mix of dramatic chops, quite a kind of eye for cool visuals and can do a bit of action. So he'd be my director.
I was trying to think of… I'm not very good at the who would be the next Bond thing. I'm not actually that invested.
Whoever it will be, will be fine, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sorry. I was thinking of that…
Is it Soap Desiru? Is that his name? From Gangs of London?
Because he's a bit older. And in Gangs of London anyway, he's really convincing at smashing people's heads in. And if he wanted to have a bit more extreme Korean violence, I think he could pull it off quite purposefully.
So that would be my pairing. As for plots, I didn't have anything as politically resonant as yours. So I've always wanted them to have another go at or to go back to the 00 versus 00 thing that they kind of set up in GoldenEye, but they never really make much of it.
It's like the twist that 006 is still alive at the end. So I'd have him against a rogue 00, which I guess isn't that dissimilar to you're going back and fighting previous James Bonds, but just the idea of regular encounters with like a single threat rather than, you know, a giant army of henchmen. And in terms of a Back Page podcast gadget, all I could come up with in my hurried scribblings at lunch was a special pill that lets him eat enormous sandwiches without feeling bloated.
Because if this is Back Page themed somehow, Bong Joon-Ho gets roped into this monstrosity of a film. Like there will have to be scenes where he eats like massive baguettes. Maybe instead of like a casino scene, there's a scene set in Tormezzo where like him and a henchman have to eat like more bread to impress each other.
Oh God. Yeah, I was just thinking, could it be like a micro SD card that Q gives him that's just like, that just has PDF scans of all the issues of NGamer on it? He just reads it on the plane.
That's the entire thing basically. Do you not think that Bong Joon-Ho would be a bit sickened by the idea of James Bond? He's so lefty and I feel like the colonial, weren't we great once, British energy of Bond would just so not be his vibe.
I think he could put Bond through the ringer a bit and punish him a bit. I think he'd have some fun with it.
I thought about Korean directors as well and I thought about Park Chan-Wook actually. Just having watched, we just talked about this fucking HBO miniseries. What was it?
Sympathizer.
Yeah, Sympathizer. There's some pretty cool spy stuff in that. That guy's very under duress spy character.
There's a lot of that kind of thing in there. I think if you're going for punishing, violent and horrific Bond, then I think Park Chan-Wook might be a slightly better fit. I like your thinking, Matthew.
It's just Bond, but Okja is there. He rides Okja at the end. That's the end of the film.
Okja could be like the villain's sort of henchman, like an odd jobs style figure.
I'm loving this. I have no notes on that. Next question then from Angry Kurt.
Hi Chaps, do you think certain modern games wouldn't have done as well if released on an earlier generation despite being technically possible? The example I was thinking of was Bellatro. Had it been released on Bellatrol?
Had it been released on PS2? I think it would have been seen today as a cult classic rather than the behemoth it is today due to a mix of social media not being a thing back then really, and people not being as used to rogue likes. I think there's an element of truth to this.
Bellatro did probably release in the era it was best for. I was thinking though Matthew that this actually would have been a pretty good touch generations DS game Bellatro, that might have done moderately well, but not hugely well. Card games weren't really a thing on PS2, except by Yu-Gi-Oh or Lost Kingdoms on GameCube, Phantom Dust on Xbox.
But Bellatro specifically, I thought, DS maybe. What do you reckon?
Yeah, I didn't think specifically about what generation of consoles it would have made sense on. It was more a broader point that I do think it's true that certain games increase literacy in a genre and allow more games to be made in that. You often need someone to make the big breakthrough so that all these other things can come.
I mean, like, could Bellatro have ever been in that game? Like, do you need, like, Hearthstone or Slay the Spire to happen for Bellatro to make sense? Like, if actually presented with Bellatro without that grounding in the genre, would you just be like, what the fuck is this?
This makes no sense. I don't know. Like, it's a bit of a chicken and an egg thing.
I think you're right.
Also, would local thunk have made Bellatro, you know, in the first place, if those other games hadn't happened first? I don't know. We'd have to ask him.
And that feels like a huge waste of his time.
You could just send Ben Starr to answer it instead, Matthew. That's Ben Starr in a costume. Yeah, I think that's all true, especially Slay the Spire is really the thing in there, where you do need that to happen, just because that's when those rogue-like deck-builders started to explode, and we've had so many of them since then.
But yeah, it's a fun thought exercise.
I do like the thought experiment of if presented with this thing 20 years ago, can you imagine how you would have dealt with it or what you would have thought of it? I thought on this for about two minutes at lunch while I was eating some gyoza.
So is that the end of your thoughts on this one? Because I have more thoughts on this one.
Oh yeah, please do, yeah.
So I actually, do you remember when Fortnite was first announced and it was a proper sort of shrug from everyone involved?
Oh yeah, yeah.
This is like in the end of, I think it was like early 2010s, the end of the 360 era. And I don't think that game would have done well if you released it in like 2010, 2011. I almost think you need a few other things to happen first.
Like the free to play model didn't exist yet. Obviously, this was back when Fortnite was more of a Minecraft-like PV style game. Obviously, the Battle Royale thing they did after, and that's what turned into a huge hit.
And I think there are some other signs of like you need it, needing things to happen in order for certain successes to unlock. So, for example, if you think about Titanfall at the end of the 360 generation into the next generation and how Respawn goes from making that Apex Legends, the difference in art style and how the game is sold really shows. That's like a great illustration of how sensibility shift there, how like MOBA character design, which I hate by the way, but I do accept.
But on the most part, I think it's quite crap and quite random. There are some exceptions for sure. It starts to like infect other genres basically, and so Apex is an example of that.
So you can see now that I don't think people would make a game that looks like Titanfall now in that same way because it's got such a 360 era aesthetic. Do you know what I mean? That sort of post-modern warfare, kind of like the militarized look that everything kind of had, even though it is sci-fi.
So that kind of came to mind. But I think there are some games that definitely would have done well at the time. Like if Insomniac could have made Spider-Man.
Oh God, why is someone fucking calling me? Like why? One second.
It's local funk.
It's Benster. Hello, Sam. Castle by himself, sitting lonely at his PC.
Right then. There are certain games I think are fairly timeless and if you plug them into like 20 years ago, they'd still be pretty big. Like if Sony on PS3 said, we're going to make the pricey Spider-Man game, chucked a bunch of money in it, got a good developer like Insomniac to make it, I think that still would have been a hit.
Likewise, if they'd have stopped making Killzone games then and made Horizon instead, following like Assassin's Creed and stuff, I feel like that kind of third person open world game has been hot for such a long time. Those are all the thoughts I came up with in my two minutes, Matthew. So yeah, thus ends the discussion.
Any more to add there? Should we move on?
I really drew a line under that with Mikey Ozer remark.
Oh, here was this one question I had. Do you think that Blueprints could have been an ex-BLA game that kind of took off? Do you think that had like the potential for that?
Or is that again where you need a kind of like load of Roguelikes to exist before that happens, you know?
Maybe, I mean, the interesting thing is if you read interviews with the guy, is it Tonda Ross? I think is his name.
That's right.
He says, like, Roguelike genre isn't a big influence on it. Like when he started working on it eight years ago, you know, it was strictly board game influence, that kind of core idea of drafting the rooms. And that the kind of game objective of getting to Room 46, he said was almost done in like the first year.
Like you could play it and work out how to get to Room 46. But, you know, what was added after that was upping the production values and building out this end game, which is now so big, it's actually the game. And what is the game is the prologue to that, I would argue.
And so, yeah, you could, you know, it did make it sound like at one point, he could have said, this is what Blueprints is, it's about getting to Room 46 and that's the end of it. And released quite a rudimentary version. So like, why not?
It's just that he believed there was more to it and just gave himself as much time as he wanted or needed to, you know, deliberately pursue feature creep is how I saw him describe it.
Yeah. Was it like, was one of the games that inspired it, Carcasson? Is that right?
I think maybe I've seen...
Yeah. I've seen him mention different board games in different places, but, you know, the idea of building out a physical place with these cards, you know, you can see the physical version of that quite easily in your mind's eye, I think.
Yeah. Carcasson had a version on XBLA as well. There was a 2007 360 release of it.
So, yeah, it's possible. But here ends the thought exercise and we move on, Matthew. I also enjoy Giotta.
What's the next question?
Hi, lads. Apparently there have been studies done on groups of men that show if ever three of them get together, they always fall into the same archetypes, the alpha, the comedian and the nerd. So my question is, which ones are you to and Jeremy when you get together?
Cheers for all your work and congratulations on your recent, at the time of writing, Patreon milestone. That's from Bob Bob. I'm assuming this is from when we hit 3,000 pounds on Patreon and promised to do a stream.
Yeah, we haven't done that yet. When are we doing that, Matthew? What should it be?
Well, we just have to have the perfect game, right?
Yeah, I guess so. But I feel like we've got to like hatch this out at some point and do it this year, you know what I mean? Because we were like...
Yeah, we can do it this year. Yeah.
Okay, it will happen. It will happen. It will be exclusive on Patreon.
We won't put it anywhere else. So it's a cursed treat for everyone. And it won't be fucking Sonic Adventure or some bullshit.
So yeah, we'll just have to figure it out.
Blueprints.
Yeah, day 89.
I want to see what day 88 looks like in Sam's blueprints.
Okay, I think that to answer the question, we've only, you, me and Jeremy have only been together in one place once, and that was last year for a Fallout event that we did.
So what happened? How did that play out?
We were all the comedian and the nerd, weren't we? That's like, basically all three of us have that persona. Do we, I don't think any of us really have the Alpha in that situation, do you?
I would say if anyone had an inkling of Alpha, in terms of the podcast, it would be you, because you're the host and you lead it and take command in that sense.
Inkling of Alpha is definitely going to be the name of my autobiography, by the way, so that's, I think I've spot on Matthew. Yeah, so, yeah, I don't think in that situation though, at dinner, that we were like, particularly, I'm quite chilled out, I don't need to sort of dominate in that situation.
You weren't running the dinner like it was a podcast, you didn't have me and Jeremy like a conversation plan for the dinner that we had to strictly follow.
Hello and welcome to the refinery, where we're having a set menu. Yeah, it wasn't like that, so, okay, good. Well, comedian and nerd, then Matthew, call it that and move on?
Yeah, or three nerds.
Yeah.
I mean, depending, you know, imagine there's plenty of people who find us crushing the unfunny.
Definitely.
I'm married to one of them.
Oh, very good. And I'm going out with one of them. Okay, next question's from Coig.
Doing a tidy up, I came across the only physical games I have somehow kept from my childhood, a smattering of N64 carts, Mario Kart 64, Lylat Wars, Diddy Kong Racing and Pokemon Stadium. Eurgh. Wondering if the lads have managed to cling on to anything for that long, and if they have any stories associated with them.
I feel like you probably have all of yours, Matthew, because we talked about this before, the little box of GBA games and stuff and such.
Yeah, I've got a tin of loose DS and GBA games. I do have my N64 carts in a plastic box somewhere. I don't have the boxes, they long disappeared.
I don't have my PC games, my PC big boxes anymore. And I think our Mega Drive and Amiga, which were our earlier consoles and gaming machines we had, I think they've long since been taken to the dump or something. So yeah, the only game I have of note, not game of note, but game cartridge of note, is my Pilotwings was a pre-owned copy from Blockbuster or something that I got given for Christmas years and years and years ago.
And it had all this gnarly, sticky residue over it from where they'd obviously put a security tag on it and then removed it, and it left some incredibly powerful adhesive. So this very sticky copy of Pilotwings, that's my 1 in 64 cartridge of notes. I can't get rid of that just because it sticks to me.
Yeah, that's fair enough. Yeah, I don't quite have as comprehensive a collection as that, and nor do I own any sticky cartridges that I'm aware of. But I did think about this, and I have my original Xbox in all its games.
That's almost like childhood. My parents literally brought the Xbox to my flat last year. They were like, we need to fucking get rid of this now.
They've very slowly been carting out all of my stuff. There's no longer a room dedicated to me in the house, which is fine. I'm a 37-year-old man, it's fine.
So I stay in a guest room, but my dad's held on to all my PS2 games, so they're still there. I sold a few of them. I've talked about this in the podcast before, but I sold, much to my regret later on, sold Persona 3, Persona 4 on PS2 for a chunk of money, and Yakuza 2 as well, which, let's face it, was rubbish on PS2 anyway, so that's fine.
But things like GTA 3, my bro, original copy of that, Final Fantasy X, they're still there. Going further back, the Mega Drive is somewhere in there. Somewhere in the house.
So, Sonic 1, 2, Echo, the Dolphin, Jurassic Park on there, which was a terrible game. They're in there somewhere, so they still exist. But things I have with me, I've got a Link's Awakening car on the original Game Boy, that I got in 1998 or something, and Super Mario Bros.
Deluxe on Game Boy Color, which is an old favorite as well, like just a great thing to take on holiday with you, that game. Good memories of that. My little brother still has my cartridge of Pokemon Blue as well, and possibly Pokemon Yellow.
So, yeah, a fair chunk of them, but they are hard to keep hold of when you go through several house moves. They either disappear between the quacks of house moves, or somehow you just lose track of them, you know?
Any incriminating Pokemon names on that Pokemon cartridge?
No, I never gave them. I was strictly a canon man. I never really renamed them.
Yeah. Did you give them names then?
Well, I didn't play it back then, so I think I just gave them all stupid names. I thought I was being kind of wry when I was reviewing them for NGamer by giving them slightly sniffy, sarcastic names.
You showed the Pokemon Corporation. Where are they now, Matthew? Nowhere.
That's the answer.
My burn absolutely torched them.
Okay then. Next question then. Do you want to read this, Matthew?
Hi gents. With Astrobot's staggering success and to everyone's surprise, we find that Microsoft is now behind the times with mascot platformers. What do you imagine an Astrobot-like celebration of Microsoft-owned IP looking like?
Wait, do I hear a pogo stick boinging in the distance? Is this the glorious return of the famed Mario killer, Commander Keen, waking up from a 30 year slumber to square off against Microsoft words clippy? Yours truly, Bjorn.
Werner Herzog's voice, you must never do this. I don't think it's a good idea, Matthew. I'm sure Bjorn doesn't either.
The question is tongue in cheek. Plenty of Xbox games I like, but the Astrobot thing really, they really would have struggled to do that much earlier than when they did, I think. They kind of needed there to be like this catapult effect of goodwill towards the PS4 from at least like 2015 onwards.
So they kind of made it the perfect time. Those are my top line thoughts before we get to specifics. What do you think?
Yeah. Well, I've only got specifics.
Okay. Let's go with your specifics then for this Xbox thing.
Well, I mean, I thought about it in a very literal way. It's just Microsoft's, you know, specifically their platforming history is so rank that I thought you could lean into that and do a slightly ironic play where Voodoo Vince and Blink's The Time Sweeper pair up together, both acknowledging that they're total dogshit mascots. And these two absolute no-hopers, they have to then navigate all the success from Microsoft IP.
So that ticks the box of, you know, taking a trip around what makes everyone excited about Microsoft, which is mostly quite like violent and sort of teen aimed games. But I like the idea of these two kind of shit no-hopers, yeah, like pairing up, acknowledging that they're both rubbish, but going on a little platforming adventure.
It's like this podcast in platformer form. Oh no.
I think we're better than... Are you saying we're Games Journalism's Voodoo Vince and Blink's The Timesweeper?
No, we are better than that. We are like... I won't say...
We're not Mario.
We're definitely not Mario, but we're better than Stubbs the Zombie, you know, for sure.
I'd say we're at least Rayman and Glowbot.
I think you're on the long the right line, so yeah, that's good.
It's kind of got that energy. But yeah, am I going to pretend that the world of Gears, Halo and maybe a Forza car showroom are going to be particularly fun to jump around in? Probably not, but what can you do?
Yeah, I struggle with this because I don't think a beat-em-up is remotely a good idea. And it's even more confusing since Microsoft bought Bethesda and Activision because then it's like, do you put in all those Warcraft characters? Is it like a Tony Hawk battering an orc with a skateboard?
I mean, how far do you go with this sort of thing?
Yeah.
So in the end, I went with like a kind of high-concept first-person game, a bit like all of the game riffs in The Stanley Parable, where there's some kind of like inexplicable meta fourth-wall-breaking reason. You need to jump between each one. So, you know, you have to help Banjo repair his bullshit airplane in Nuts and Bolts, or jump off Agency Tower and crack down in first-person.
And then you wake up on stage at E3 2013, and Don Mattrick is about to like burn the entire brand down, basically. You got to stop him.
You got to stop him.
And then the final, I guess, like, then the final character you'd meet would be Blinx, kind of like Chop Master Onion style. He was the main, he was the last character, wasn't he, in old Astrobot. So, yeah, I feel like Blinx doesn't quite have that prestige, but as a certain type of Xbox sticker, he'll be waiting to see him.
So that's my pitch, Matthew. It's not very good either. But, you know, it sure is enough.
Sorry, yeah, sorry. Mine's very much like the gyoza point of this particular response. Okay, next question, next question then.
Oh, why did I include this one? What was I thinking? I just pasted it in and I was like, what the fuck is it?
I think this is in response to a discourse. You know how every now and then someone on social media go, people reckon the 90s were better for video games, huh? Well, check this out.
And then it's something incredibly offensive from a print media product back then, that no one would endorse and say is good. And you're like, well, I guess maybe this distracts you from the fact that this planet is going to fucking burn into a pile of ash in a few years.
Listen, if Duncan on the 90s makes you feel better about literally living on a burning planet ruled by some of the nastiest motherfuckers ever to walk the earth, then fine. Yeah, sure. 90s games magazines with the villains.
Yeah.
Yeah, go for it. So yeah, with that in mind, let's come to Zach's question. Would you rather, bullet point, gecks covering your breasts such as they are?
Bullet point two, James Pond covering your bum. Bullet point three, Shadow the Hedgehog covering your groin. And on the cover of the first and last edition of The Back Page magazine.
So this is seems a fictional magazine. I went with James Pond, Matthew, because I think bums are inherently amusing.
Yeah, the only problem with that, not that I gave this question much thought, is that James Pond, his ability, at least in the James Pond game I played, was that he stretches. He's very tall and thin. Like there isn't a lot of real estate to cover much of a bum.
Like he could extend his body and perfectly cover just like the crack. But like there's going to be a lot of buttocks either side of him. He's going to look like quite a weird, I don't know, sandwich or something.
That's really my only scientific observation.
I can no longer discuss this because the existential despair is taking me over.
I just wanted to know if I had given it some thought, like 30 seconds of thought.
I appreciate that.
It's just like a half a gyoza question for me.
It's like writing questions out of gyoza. I like that.
The time it took me to eat half a gyoza is the time I thought about whether I'd want Gex covering my mandoes.
I would have compromised on Shadow the Hedgehog covering my groin if it was Sonic the Hedgehog covering my groin because I feel like there's at least some platformer prestige there where Shadow is just quite annoying and embarrassing.
I don't know. I think that would make things weird between you and whoever's doing it. And I'd rather it was Shadow just because I'm not going to have any dealings with him because he's absolutely rank as well.
So, like Sonic, there could be a... You know, he's kind of cool again, or sort of cool again.
He's popular again. Not to you.
No, not to me. But even so, like if I was to, you know... I'd rather completely ruin things with Shadow than Sonic is what I'm saying.
And I think it would ruin it. Because whenever you saw each other, you'd be like, remember that photo shoot? And that's weird.
Dear God, get me out of this question now. What have you picked, Matthew? For what?
For this. What did you pick?
Oh, what did I pick? Well, I only really thought about the James, but I guess, yeah, Shadow the Hedgehog.
I love that you had loads of in-depth thoughts about what would happen if this happened to me, but then no actual answer to the question.
No, it wasn't if it happened to you. I was thinking if it happened to either of us. I was speaking on our behalf.
Okay, fair enough, yeah. I'll go on first issue and Matthew can go on last issue with James Pond, and we'll see how that goes. Covering the breast is far too cursed.
No one needs to see any of these, so we move on. Next question, Matthew.
Cart racers. What untapped IPs would be a good fit for a Mario Kart knockoff? What IPs would be especially cursed?
Watch out for Mikael Laugason in Borgon Kart. He's gonna drop some Danish tabloids on the track for you to slip on.
You must appreciate someone like watching Borgon and engaging with Borgon, Matthew. You've always been wanting that from the distance.
Yes, I have, but I feel like it's out of pity now.
I've made a stink and now people are pretending to be interested. Where I wanted them to come naturally. They had a chance with that tweet and they refused.
Fair enough. I think probably the most straightforward ones are probably some really fucking hack suggestions like The Simpsons or something. I don't know if they ever did that, for example.
That's the sort of thing that comes to mind. I'm not saying that anyone should make that or that it's a good idea. Getting into more cursed territory, I think in June might be good.
They got those Ornithopter things, so it could be a bit Diddy Kong racing-ish and also those big worms as well. They could participate.
I was going to ask, in June, are they riding the big worms, or is the big worm a character on the character select screen?
He's in a little Ornithopter, a little cartoon one. I think that would work actually in the vein of a Konami crazy kart race is where it was called, like GBA graphics. I think that would be good.
Yeah, a little worm lad with hands.
I could see Baron Harkonnen dropping some of that oily slop that he bathes in as to spin everyone out behind him.
Absolutely, yeah. And then, yeah, I don't have any other hilarious things to add on that one. The other thing, getting to really cursed territory, Coronation Street Kart, Red Shelling, Ken Barlow as Dev A'la Han and stealing Deirdre from him.
In between this kart, driving past someone and calling them a bus wanker. These are like the really cursed ones. So I'm just, I'm lowest common denominator.
I'm meeting you on your level here, Naece Lynn. So I hope that, I hope you appreciate that. Matthew, what have you got?
All I came up with was like famous TV detectives in their iconic vehicles. So Inspector Morse in his like classic car, the guy from Midsommar Murders, Barnaby in his whatever generic.
Don't they all just drive like a Mercedes or a BMW or something?
Probably.
Yeah.
Yeah. And like different tracks based in their, in their different sort of remits. So Oxford for Morse, Midsommar for the Midsommar Murders lot, getting to drive around Edinburgh as Rebus, which we know Edinburgh has been good in racing games before.
So I think there's something in that.
Who are your DLC characters who get just two shits to make the main roster? Like Naffa? Will DL and Pasco get reduced to DLC for example?
Is that post-launch update one, DL and Pasco, Matthew?
That's only for when we do the sequel, which is more like Double Dash and there's two races in every car. That's when you have Cagney and Lacey and...
Morse and Lewis.
Turner and Hooch. But for this first game, it's quite purist. It's like single detectives only.
Frost, Morse, Rebus, you know, Monk. Cracker?
Will Cracker get in there? Robbie Coltrane?
Cracker! Is it Jane Tennyson?
Yeah, Helen Mirren in...
Helen Mirren? Yeah, you know, Mayor of East Town.
East Town gets added as a DLC track as well. Oh my god.
East Town. Everyone's like, quick, take the shortcut. We do a little jump over that naked body found in the creek.
Yeah, the dead body of Evan Peters. So not ideal. Yeah, so if you expand this to the US, it suddenly becomes a bit more, there's a bit more juice to it.
Cause you know, would like Doctor House? Would like medical mysteries count? You know?
I mean, you're more likely to have Dick Van Dyke from Diagnosis Murder.
Yeah, who's the other one who was like an ancient doctor bloke and he goes around on a speedboat sometimes, so it's on BBC Primetime. Not Primetime, definitely not Primetime. Mid afternoon, I can't remember it.
It'll come back to me.
Not Bergerac.
No, not, no, but Bergerac, even a little boat wouldn't need Bergerac. You'd have to like go alongside in a kind of river in parallel to the main track. That would kind of work.
No, I can't remember it. Quincy, that's it.
Oh, Quincy.
Yeah, Quincy is rubbish, but he might make it. Again, title update 3 for this game would be Quincy. Okay, that's enough on that one, I think, Matthew, unless you had more to add.
No.
Okay, three yeos is out of five for that one. Good stuff. The next question is from SAFC.
Jack91. Was thinking the Evil Pass side game you can do in Lord of the Rings The Third Age playing as the villains in boss battles to get special items, et cetera, for the main game, and wondered if you had any thoughts on other games that would be fun with a similar system. I quite like this question, Matthew.
I did think about how The Force Unleashed, the first one, had that DLC we could play as Evil Star Killer, and you could go kill Obi-Wan Kenobi and all this kind of stuff. It was quite violent and you kind of suspected that maybe they snuck a couple of preposterously violent things past Lucas licensing without anyone noticing. Quite enjoyable.
I was thinking that God of War, the more recent ones might be good for this. Maybe you play as like overweight Thor or something, and you like kill-
So it runs in parallel with Kratos' campaign?
Yeah, or like it's like an alternate version of it. So he kills Kratos in it, that kind of thing. That sort of came to mind.
And he kills Kratos and kills all his little mates, kills the squirrel, etc. You know how I feel about the critters in that game. That came to mind Matthew, I didn't have loads of ideas passed out.
What did you come up with?
In terms of like a game where I would like to play as the bosses that I fought or characters, in the Metal Gear series, is like prime territory for this. I'd love to play Metal Gear Solid 1 as Cyborg Ninja.
Oh, that's a good one. Yeah, because they did add him as a playable character in the VR missions. So I think that would work.
Yeah, that's good.
But yeah, just to see the whole campaign, like what he's getting up to on his little storyline, all of them really, like I like those characters. I like that they've turned up and they've taken over these locations. What does that taking over look like?
So I would happily play all of those DLCs.
Yeah, C or SoRide-
That's what I got.
Good stuff. C or SoRide did an MGS4, which is kind of what Revengeance sort of was, but not quite. Got to cut those cow robot things, but otherwise didn't quite fulfill the promise.
But hey, it's a solid enough game. This is a great question, Matthew, this next one.
Hello, podders. Have you ever discussed the making of working progress pieces on games for mags or online on the pod? I'm interested in how these pieces get made.
Do they rely on access to devs, a writer who knows the studio creative team well, or Pierre if I'm setting them up? What are the expectations for developers and mags for the piece? Thanks in advance, Kronoferne.
So I thought about doing a whole episode around previews and how that stuff happens. Back in the early days of the pod when we were doing like review scores and cover related episodes, but didn't quite have a thing to hook it around. So we've probably talked around this, we definitely talked about going on press trips and stuff before.
But this is a great question. I've seen both sides of this now because I've worked on magazine covers for PR purposes and, you know, I've written plenty as a journalist. And I think that it's...
Well, first of all, I'll hear your answer, Matthew, before I start steamrolling over this question.
Well, I'm going to admit that your steamrolling is welcome because I misunderstood this. When it said working progress pieces on games, I didn't necessarily think of that as previews and was slightly puzzled by this one. The one thing I would say is that for me specifically, and this is why I think you'll have a better answer to it.
I worked on a lot of mags where the previews weren't necessarily based on the best access, particularly like NGamer. We were out of the loop on a lot of things and we didn't get invited into a lot of things. So a lot of our preview coverage was more about harvesting everything that was out there and bringing everything together in a compelling way.
That was kind of our unique hook, I guess, or our approach. But I can't admit that that, you know, I can't pretend, sorry, that that isn't a... that was just like a desperate attempt to cover up the fact that we weren't getting invited to a lot of things.
So actually, I feel like, you know, I've done plenty of previews where I've had good access to the games, but less than people might think, if that makes sense.
Yeah, it's definitely done a few.
So I'm always a little bit, like, sheepish about it, I guess, that so much of my preview writing was based on just, like, scrabbling together stuff. I feel like you can offer a lot more clarity.
Yeah, so let's take cover features particularly, right? Because I think they're a very specific kind of thing. What you're talking about, the idea of, like, access to devs and a writer who knows the studio creative team well, that's the sort of thing you're more likely to think about when it comes to doing a cover feature than doing a straight preview, which will often come down to who is available, especially these days when, you know, media is a very challenged landscape.
There are fewer journalists than there were before. And so basically, I think, what is it interesting about cover feature? I think it is a bit of a kind of unspoken agreement of the magazine needs it to hype up the cover, make people excited about the product itself, right?
Buying the magazine and reading the magazine, being invested in that. And the publisher obviously wants to make an event out of there, a big marketing beat, like the reveal of the game, or a big preview, or something like that. And I think there is a little bit of an unspoken, well, we kind of go into this knowing that this won't be the point in the campaign where the journalists are likely to shit on the game because they do want you to be excited about it.
That's not to say that they give you a free pass and say nothing negative by any means. But I do think that there is a little bit more of a kind of like a bit more neutrality or a bit more like open mindedness to what is this thing and getting your arms around it in that sense, as opposed to it being like, you know, we've played eight hours of this, it's out in a month and here's why the progression system is complete dogshit. It's not that kind of thing, for example.
It's a bit more specific and yeah, I can say that from a PR perspective, I've pitched these things in coffee shops like I show. I like doing that. I've like went to a coffee number one in bar to pitch one of my frontier covers, for example.
That was quite fun just getting them. This is the only way I could show them assets because I couldn't share the assets externally and I wanted them to get excited about the game. You often have to ask at loads in advance because people will ask a month or two before an issue is out and then by that point you're really too late, especially with some like Edge, for example, very sought after covers because obviously they look amazing and they get great access and all that kind of stuff.
I tend to pitch those at about as far in advance as I can. If I can get it like four to five months in advance, maybe even six months, I'll do that sometimes. I think that's key because it's just a really nice thing to have.
As part of a campaign, worked on a Doom cover this year for Edge where I had to do pencil drawings of Doom guy because I couldn't share the art externally until a certain point. Edge have terrible, terrible drawings I did on my phone of what the key art layout looks like including a really naff picture of a dragon that I drew and bless their patience for sticking with me on that. The cover looked amazing in the end.
I would have included that as a brutal box out in the preview.
Subscriber cover, you know. So yeah, it's a bit of a, yeah, I thought I was thinking about this because I was thinking about Jeremy's feature on Flintlock, which is a game that got a bit of a mixed response, but I thought was one of the cover features that got me the most hyped about something. It's not because he was full on hype man in it, it's because he made every element of it sound interesting, like the way that the game would use firearms, your little fox companion in it and that kind of thing, and also the idea of it being a soul's like, but in a setting you've not really seen before and all that kind of stuff.
I think that is what the goal of it is to be like, we're blowing this thing as wide open as we can and getting our arms around it. I think that maybe that's a little bit less critical than you might see in other types of writing. What do you think Matthew?
Certainly, you go in wanting it to be good because you want to put a good game on your cover. That isn't to say, I don't think you'd whitewash something that was a disaster. If it was truly disastrous, I think you'd be having big conversations as a team about like, this is actually cover material, this.
Luckily, that never really happened with us.
Ever did a ReCore cover on OXM?
No, we never did a ReCore cover. However shit an editor I was, I wasn't that shit. No, I think ReCore may have had like, three panels on the front of an issue of like, three games coming this year, and ReCore was like, hidden behind a lot of other sort of stickers and whatnot.
So.
Fair enough. Okay.
Move over ReCore, we've got other cover lines.
Move over ReCore, it's Quantum Break.
Which is a cool game. We did a Quantum Break cover.
That's a cool game.
Yeah, I guess the ones where, not that this is particularly the question, where I'd be a bit sore was when you had, what was clearly going to be a good game, probably in a traditional mold, like a big AAA thing where just so much money had been spent on it that you were like, well, there's going to be a certain level of polish with this. And the access was quite bad and you'd have to really scrabble to make it work. I don't know if this is misinterpreting it, but it felt sometimes cockiness of like, well, this thing's big, you want it, I know you want it.
We're going to give you this very small beat, which is basically what you'll be covering on your preview. Often these campaigns are built around a gradual release of information and your cover may coincide with like, in this one we're talking about the customisation of the guns or whatever and then you're like, well, this is going to be quite dry and hard to talk about. Those ones are a little difficult because, like, even though you are genuinely excited, there is something slightly undeserving about it and, like, I've weirdly had to eat, like, eat shit a couple of times for things that I was otherwise up for and into.
That's, that's not great.
Yeah, it's tough. I do, I've definitely been in that position before where you don't, you don't have all the access you want, but the game's right and there's not even new artwork and you're like, oh god, but I don't have time for anything else so the other thing is just not big enough and, you know, yeah.
Yeah, I've done something in the last, like, five years where it was just, like, an interview for quite a sizable cover feature.
Yeah.
Like, it was like 10 plus pages and it was fine, but, like, we hadn't seen the game for quite a long time and it felt like you were just completely going on someone's word and they were an interesting speaker and they were very open. They were happy to talk about anything, but you almost need to have seen a bit of the game to have something interesting to actually engage them about. Otherwise, you're just taking, like, random pot shots at what might be in there.
Those previews, and particularly for cover features, were the worst when it's like, this game hasn't been announced, but you've got an interview, and you're like, well, what questions do I possibly ask to kind of crack this thing open when it has no shape? I do one of those for Watch Dogs 2. Right.
And that, you know, you obviously had Watch Dogs 1 to go on. You had the basic shape of it. But like all my questions were like, you know, how does it evolve or develop on this from Watch Dogs 1?
Where if I'd known in advance it was this, you know, San Francisco, very different character, very different vibe. You know, I think I could have written a way more interesting piece, but I felt like we did the coverage in all the wrong order with that one, which was quite frustrating.
I think, though, that this is a bit of an inevitable result of the games industry moving away from using presses like the Beall and Endall, which is what it used to do. And so you used to get these, you used to be able to have a magazine, a bunch of magazine features drop at once that crack open what a game is. And now every, like, big marketing beat has got such high stakes and has so many stakeholders involved that you actually, like, struggle, you would struggle to get access for so many of the big things.
So it just means that interviews are the easiest thing you can get because getting assets signed off or even made takes ages and requires a certain amount of people. And then, like, definitely the advantage that tiny publishers have, indie publishers have, they have the agility to go and get assets and, like, make the thing as they see fit. Like, I imagine that's why.
If you think about things like the Edge still wakes the deep cover, or like the, I think there's like a PC Gamer and an Edge cover of Expedition 33, those are kind of games where they're, like, big enough to be cover games. But the publisher is agile enough that you can get the assets without it being a huge headache. That's like the, that's why I think, like, some of those mid-level publishers just, you kind of see quite a few covers from those kinds of companies because they can actually get the stuff made for you, and they're a little bit less rigid than the major publishers are.
I'm really talking like shop here, really inside baseball stuff. But I think if you did, if you wanted to, I want to give you a comprehensive answer to this question so that it was a good question, but loads of things come into play with this, and there's a massive roll of the dice that the editor has to take a real leap of faith and hoping that the right thing comes out of it, the right access comes out of it. The truth is that probably 45 percent of the time it does, 55 percent of the time it doesn't.
That was about my experience, Matthew. Do you think that seems fair?
90 percent of my O&M covers was the same bit of marrow off the Nintendo Press Library, so my challenges as a cover maker were slightly different.
Yeah, indeed. Well, that one gets six salmon rolls out of six, Matthew, so good stuff. This next question then, what would Back Page Podcast, the Hayes Light game, look like?
What's its ridiculous premise and what are some of the asymmetric shenanigans? Plucky yet traumatized heroes, Samuel and Matthew, get up to us from Balladeer.
So the premise, we decide to try and climb the Apple Podcast ranks by going into the worlds of the UK gaming podcasts that are above us on the charts to ruin them from within. So they're kind of physical landscapes that are based on the character and vibe of those podcasts.
Dave Turner's boss bow. I know where this is going.
Yeah, so a world based on TCGS, a world based on IGN UK, there's a world that's based on something that's probably on BBC Sounds, that kind of stuff. Yeah, Samuel does all the planning for this podcast. All I really ever do is splice the audio together.
Which is important. It is important that you do that.
It is important. And I've spun these out into suitable powers. So Samuel's powers, they all revolve around the skills that make you, let you make a well maintained Google doc.
It's a very font based move set. You can kill enemies with strikethroughs. There's a bit where we lean to get through wonky gaps by becoming italic.
That kind of stuff. Whereas I just kill enemies by turning up Samuel's deafening laugh. And I turn down the volume on our footsteps so we can sneak past enemies.
I think that's quite a good central mechanic. I actually missed the joke about who would be a good final boss, which you're right would be a host of a rival podcast.
Definitely Dave Turner's.
I just wrote that the final boss is a guest's terrible audio file.
That is good. I can't top that. I have nothing even remotely close to that really.
I thought that me and Matthew, because we're not authors, we don't have published works or like, I have a lot of Google Docs that I never ever want the public to see. As do all aspiring authors. So I thought I would get pulled into like, fucking one of Matthew's Japanese detective novels or something.
Like we have to solve like the Hong Jin murders together or something. And then like Matthew gets pulled into like The Ultimates with me and has to fight evil Reed Richards. That's what I could come up with for this.
Hey, I'd be into, I think more people would be into that IP crossover than a guy whose powers all have a sort of thematic connection to Google Doc formatting. This is why I'm not in charge of making games.
And it ends with us being the shit out of Kenneth from 30 Rock basically. That's all I got for that one. Okay, yours gets an Edge 6 and mine gets an Edge 7, Matthew.
I think that's right.
If you had to fight a rival podcast host as a final boss, who would you be most intimidated by?
Dave Turner should just have the Barbz to take me down. Take you and I down.
You know the combat barks would be incredible in that boss fight.
Yeah, I don't want to start saying who would be the easiest ones to beat. I have some thoughts on that, but I won't share them because it will just create too many problems.
Yeah, that's true. Maybe we move swiftly on diplomatically.
That sounds good. Yeah, I wish all those other podcasts well. This next question then, Matthew.
Hello. With the recent return of Uncanny to Friday Night Primetime BBC, though the series will have long ended by the next spellbag, most likely, correct. Are you team skeptic or team believer?
Have you ever seen a ghost? Finally, if Boo had his own video game, what would it be like? That's from Daddy Magic.
But are you familiar with Uncanny?
No, I never saw this.
It's that show that Danny Robbins hosts. Oh, yeah. It's him investigating ghost stories, but it's always framed through the lens of he has two experts, someone who's team skeptic, someone who's team believer.
I only know about this because Rob Pearson, who I work with, is very into Uncanny. And I am, to spoil my answer to this question, very much a non-believer in ghosts. And so we've had lots of lunchtime squabbles about whether listening to any ghost-based media is worthwhile.
Right.
I am 100% team skeptic. I don't believe ghosts exist. Never seen a ghost, obviously, because they don't exist.
I don't think I'll share my crawler philosophy on ghost stories.
You don't like the others with Nicole Kidman? That's a great ghost film.
Oh, I like ghost films, but I don't think they're proposing. I think they're riffing on the concept of ghosts. I don't think the others is proof that ghosts exist.
No, it's not serious scientific work.
I've been arguing about Uncanny with Rob for so long now, but it just feels like part of my work routine, really. But I have promised the next time Danny Robbins brings his touring show to Bath, I have said to Rob that I will go and hear it out. And so I can talk about that on the podcast, hopefully, when that happens.
Yeah, I don't even ghost either, to be clear. You know, like, I believe in Mr. X, but not ghosts. So yeah, that's my stance, Matthew.
But yeah, yeah. What about the boo part of this question? It's boo in Luigi's Mansion.
King Boo is, yeah. Are there individual... Maybe you do collect individual boos in the first one.
Yeah, brings a bell.
But it's a game where you play as a boo. That's how I'm reading it.
Oh, yeah, I guess that makes sense. I don't have a good pitch for that. I don't think ghostly interactions are like good fodder for video games.
The one thing I will say about Boo, obviously what defines a boo is that when someone looks at him, he freezes and like ceases to exist. And I do wonder if there's a stealth mechanic in, well, I can't work out if it's a stealth mechanic in that when people look at you, you're invisible, which means it basically is a shit stealth game because no one can ever catch you. Or if like the existential crisis of not existing when someone looks at you, if that's like the fail state, so it's all about voiding lines of sight because you can't be perceived as a boo.
A bit like the kind of weeping angels Doctor Who thing, a bit in reverse.
Yeah, I just think there's something in that and like the fact that it can go through walls and ceilings, they kind of hover. King Boo, you know, there's like a hierarchy to that world so you can work for King Boo in some capacity. Listen, this was like a one-geose, I thought.
Yeah, and with that in mind, let's move on, I think. I just wrote down the words, a boo game should just be fatal frame but with boos. That was all I wrote down so it's just not very insightful.
Yeah, I wish the question well and we move on to the next question Matthew from Regible Fly. Dear big boys, it's time. You have been thrown into a maelstrom of fandom and you must ally yourself with one faction that will prove victorious in a blood war.
I see they mean bloody war as opposed to a war for blood or over blood. I don't know. This has nothing to do with what you like.
It's just what you're going to need to survive. Do you side with Sonic fans, Persona fans or The Sims fans? That's the entire question, Matthew.
So which of these factions has the best chance of surviving a bloody war?
I went with The Sims because I'm not stereotyping here. I'm simply basing this on my own interactions with people in my life. I think it's more likely to skew women than the other two.
And I generally trust women more in a pinch than men. So I think The Sims is the call there. I just think it would probably be a bit more likely to survive.
If you know, why the last man shit?
No, I get that. I think that's good. I actually misread this question.
I was just thought about, like, which of these things do I like rather than which of these things is going to help me survive a war? Which is actually the interesting hook of the question.
So your answer is, I like persona more than Sonic.
Yeah, my answer was I like persona. I mean, I don't think I even have a gyoza while I was working on this answer. But, you know, very quickly thinking about it, I think the Sims Army is most likely to have like the most reasonable adults on it.
Yeah, that's true.
I'd feel better being around those people. You may disagree with this, but I feel like I could be more, maybe more useful or important in an army of Sonic fans or persona fans. Like, I think I could boss them about a bit.
I don't think I could in the Sims Army, but.
Definitely the Sonic fans.
Is that really what this is about? Is it about which of these things is going to make you feel powerful?
You're the Alpha among Sonic fans. There's a great pitch for like YA dystopian fiction.
I think that's true. I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to say.
No, I think.
And like the Alpha doesn't have to fight in the front lines.
No, can just be back.
As we know.
Yeah, back in back office, just ordering people around, you know.
Sending them over the top. I imagine this is a bit like World War I.
Yeah, everyone's getting like, trench foot, but dressed as Shadow the Hedgehog or whatever. That's, yeah, I can see that. Yeah, okay, well, I went with The Sims, and you went with the Sonic just so you can boss people around.
That sums us up quite nicely, Matthew.
You imagine a sad, Wilfred Owen World War I poem that has to mention Big the Cat.
Oh, I've only had more time to write a riff on that before we recorded this episode, however you didn't.
What a great thought that would have been. This is why I just do it off by heart. Imagine that.
That would be amazing podcasting. Unfortunately, I am not very good at podcasting.
I think you're perfectly good at it.
This is why we're not on comedy bang bang.
Yeah, but they have more time to prep. You and I had about 45 minutes each.
They're improvisers.
Oh, well, fair enough, yeah. I bet they're getting fucking tipped off about what's coming up anyway. Go on.
Samuel, what? Samuel, do you have your own Shootakumi and Randy Newman? That's from Oolong.
So I assume they mean like a developer I'm fanatical about. Well, fanatical might be the wrong word, but I respect and admire. And a musician may be like a slightly esoteric choice of like that I'm also-
What's your esoteric obsession? That's how I read this, yeah.
Yeah, it's funny because I think that Randy Newman, my version of this would probably be either like New Order or Depeche Mode. Those are kind of my-
Yeah, that's true.
My go-to bands. I don't think- Dave Garhen from Depeche Mode really counts as-
He's not as funny as Randy Newman, to be honest. He's just a good musician who's- It is like 50s or 60s.
So that comes to mind.
The shooter- It's not great ammunition for podcast hilarity.
No, not necessarily. I don't know if I have a shooter kumi equivalent. I've definitely had periods I've been preoccupied with with what Kojima's up to or what Ken Levine's up to.
I really listen to a bunch of the- I would read every Ken Levine interview and listen to every Irrational podcast back when they made those during the creation of Bioshock Infinite. But I don't know if these days I really do.
Do you observe any from me as someone who probably engages with me about games more than anyone else?
Outside of a lot of the shared biggies, we're-
Like McCarmy, you know?
Yeah, you know, but that isn't quite the same thing. Yeah. Are you quite an admirer of Amy Hennig's?
Yeah, I like Amy Hennig. I don't know if I know any more about Amy Hennig than the standard person though. Like, I definitely don't mention Amy Hennig.
That's the only thing that popped into my head, but I was unsure about it.
I'm excited about the prospect of Amy Hennig doing interviews this year for that Marvel 1943 game, which I assume will be at Summer Game Fest this year. And then maybe at that point, we'll start seeing it pop up in places. That'd be cool.
Maybe you need to just pick someone and double down on them. Maybe you need to become a huge Tonda Ross head.
I don't think I can be after I said that this game repeatedly kicked me in the balls for 80 days, basically. That's not... I don't think that's going to...
Me and Tonda are going to really hit it off in that respect. Yeah, I do wish I had something like this, but this is what is quite special about Matthew's connection to certain games, though, is because he really gets into certain things in this very specific way. I think I'm much more of a generalist than Matthew is.
I don't think there's as much that I'm as hyper zoomed in on. I don't know if I even have an equivalent to Ace Attorney of a series that I'm all in on. For example, like Final Fantasy, I've not finished a whole bunch of the mainline ones.
I don't think there's anything quite like that where I'm like, this is my corner and this is what I'm all about. Metal Gear is probably as close as it gets, you know, or...
It's whoever directed Shadows of the Empire.
Indeed. Okay, so I'm sorry to disappoint you there, but the Depeche Mode bit is accurate. Definitely would have been Kojima back in MGS4 times.
That was a huge deal when that game came out. But he's just like, would Shootakumi be a special if he was out there tweaking about Morbius? I'm not sure he would be, do you know what I mean?
It's sort of like, his lack of public appearances is an asset. And I would say that Kojima is overexposed, you know?
If I was Shootakumi, I'd get Capcom to set up a room that looks like that room Kojima has photos in, except with a statue of Dick Gumshoe. And I'd have lots of pictures with like, indie bands from Scotland and things.
Yeah, Timothy Chalamet, Sam White, and...
That would just be such a great bit for someone to do.
Yeah, I would like that. My suggestion to Matthew in tech's form is, I've never had, I tweeted this, that's not true at all. But like, just the idea that someone comes to one of those Kojima photoshoots dressed exactly like him, that would be a great bit, I think.
You just come in the same day, wearing the most inexplicable, fashionable clothes that are sold in Japan. I think that would be perfect.
Oh, I thought you meant the astronaut.
Well, that would be good too, I suppose. Okay, next question is from Ryan Plugs. You guys have, among other things, one of the better sounding podcasts I regularly listen to, so I can only assume your audio setup is a good one.
The pillow fort doing wonders there. Would either of you ever look into getting voiceover work in video games since seeing as you're both comfortable working with an audio format already? What do you think, Matthew?
You did get asked to do some voiceover, right? And I was disappointed you didn't do it, because can you now reveal what that was for? Can we talk about that?
Or is that like, you know, is it not-
Well, that was for like an advert.
Yeah, but the thing it was an advert for was so you. I was quite disappointed you didn't do it.
Yeah, someone asked me if I wanted to do some VO for a ghost trick advert.
That would have been so good.
Yeah, I kind of chickened out a bit, I think. I don't know, I'm quite self-conscious about my voice, because whenever someone does an impression of me, it's always horrible. It's never like, oh, I'm doing a cool impression of someone.
Hey, ladies, it's me, Matthew Castle.
I've heard my own voice, you know, I know what it sounds like. It doesn't sound like a character in a game. Like, video actors have a different quality to them.
We actually had Ben Starr and Jennifer English who were in our offices the other day because they were down to see PlayStation Access about Expedition 33. When you're just talking to them, their voices are just so clear and nice. And there is a quality.
There is like a Starr quality to someone's voice. And while I'm very happy that people can, you know, stomach my voice on this podcast, I just, I think it would sound so out of place.
Well, I think you're wrong.
I'd love to. I mean, my dream is like, fable NPC. I would do anything.
Just have one sound bite in that fucking fable game.
Yeah, that'd be awesome. I'd love that too. I think side character in like a Professor Layton or that kind of like, you know, that sort of game or an open world game is perfect for you.
Also, I think you're wrong about your voice though, because if you think about Episode 200, for example, like that's less us kind of like, oh, I've just eaten a fucking lamb dinner and I'm recording a podcast voice and more us trying to enunciate as opposed to just riffing or, you know, kind of like talking out of our arse. And I think when we try, we can sound a little bit more pro than we normally do.
But it's the acting. I can't act for shit.
Well, I mean, you know...
You were so correct this one, we did Episode 200. How frustrated you got with my terrible line reading.
I wasn't frustrated. I just wanted to get it right. And so I did...
When you were reading...
Yeah, that's what David Fincher says on Take 86.
No, I thought you were... But you were good. And you persisted until you got a middle ground between it sounding like you were reading for an audiobook and you were trying to act as yourself in the fiction of the episode, you know?
The thing this question makes me think of... Years ago, before Toy Story 2 came out, I was obsessed with Toy Story 2. I couldn't wait for it to come out.
I'd watch every feature going about it and there was a half-hour making of on Channel 4 hosted by Andy Peters and as part of this, Andy Peters got to voice a line in Toy Story 2 and when you watch Toy Story 2, I don't know if he's still in the... whatever cut is on Disney Plus or whatever, but certainly in the cinemas, it gets to a sudden bit in the film where there's one character and it's just this like fucking Andy Peters and it's so obviously him and he sounds so different in tone to all the other characters in Toy Story. So Andy Peters going, it's get that box on that plane or something and that's what it would be like.
It would be so fucking obvious the one line that it's me would be like, oh, it's that guy. I'm completely out of this now and I don't want to ruin fable or whatever in the way that Andy Peters ruined Toy Story 2.
Well, I mean, he's since been patched out and replaced with Hayden Christensen, Matthew, so that's not a good thing. This is like how in, I think we've actually talked about this exact thing before and I said the same thing I'm about to say, which is that Jonathan Ross is in Shrek 2, but only in the British version and in the US is voiced by Larry King in the American version and Joan Rivers is in the American version. I think everyone in the UK knows who Joan Rivers is and that would carry quite well.
But it's voiced by Kate Thornton in the UK, which is just again like a bit of a pull you out. I think Andy Peters stands the test time a little bit better as a pick, but yeah, I see what you mean Matthew. But no one's suggesting that you're going to turn up like opposite Tom Hanks and something though.
Like there's no reason you couldn't have been an NPC in like Expedition 33 to use as an example because you mentioned Ben Starr. The bigger concern I have, we talked about this, voice actors are getting hotter. I talked to you about how Ben Starr is a very good looking man, and just lately noticed a trend of voice actors who are all very good looking.
So the likes of Dan Castellanata might have no future in this industry, or Harry Shearer. Do you know what I mean? Because I think now you have to be hot enough to pose in Comic Con photos and stuff, and that's what I think will get you and me unstuck.
You know what I mean? That's why I don't think it will happen.
Do you remember there was that guild of handsome voice actors that appeared two months ago, and they had a Hollywood Reporter or Vanity Fair photoshoot, and it was a big crowd of them.
The Pixel Pack. I laughed so much at the Pixel Pack.
But they were all absolutely gorgeous.
Yeah, so good looking.
Where jobbing voice actors used to be 50-year-old men who just had the uncanny ability to sound like a 10-year-old girl or whatever.
Yeah, it was a nice feature, but it was so obviously the title Pixel Pack was so cringy you'd obviously come up with by an editor who's 20 years too old to have played any computer games. That was annoying. But the idea was nice, but I agree.
We'd be muscled out the likes of you and me, Matthew. I think that answers the question anyway. Four gyoza for that one, I think.
Yeah, like if anyone's going to have a podcast in the background of their game, like on a radio station or something, I'm not saying GTA 6, but smaller, smaller scale. I think we could do a convincing fake podcast.
Yeah, I pitched Arcade Paradise 2, because Jim Trinker was in there. I'm not saying I want to take Jim Trinker's work away from him, but I want to be on a secondary radio station in the next Arcade Paradise game with Matthew. That'd be perfect, I think.
Yeah.
Okay. This next one's quite a fun question, Matthew. I imagine this is a nightmare for you to prep.
Oh, yeah. Yes. Right.
I sort of forgot about this one. Right. Here's one for the lads.
Top five game and sandwich pairings. For example, Death Stranding plus some gravel on Day Old Rye. No bodily foods.
Sonic Mania plus egg sandwich. Duke Nukem 3D plus bacon sand.
I think we should start tag teaming when we get a question like this. Like how you took the Spit Fiction one did a good job. Like you can tag me in Wrestling Style and I'll do a good job with this one.
Because I did think about this and I've got five answers in response to this.
I wrote a rather humorless answer which is I don't eat sandwiches at the same time as I'm playing games because I don't want to get butter in my limited edition Astro Bot Dual Sense.
The mailbag everybody.
Yeah, happy mailbag. A lot of, yes.
Shall I take it from here?
Tell me some of your sandwich pairings. I'll see if it triggers any great thoughts.
Right, okay. Vampire the Masquerade, but it's a blood sausage hot dog. Okay, good.
South Park on N64 and it's a turkey sandwich on Rye Bread because you fight so many turkeys in that game. Okay, yeah. So far so good.
Promise mascot agency and like a Japanese Mart egg mayo sandwich because I think that's...
Oh, that's good...
.thematically spot on and I guess this game is fresh in the memory. So too is Expedition 33 and a Breein caramelized onion baguette Matthew.
Oh yeah, yeah.
And finally, blueprints but it's a different random sandwich every day you open the box. Are those not some solid answers to this question?
Those are some solid answers. That means you'd have eaten 88 sandwiches.
Yeah, it's true. Yeah, I mean, but I have, you know what I mean? Like in real life.
But way more at this point, so that's fine. Okay, that's as much thought as that question deserves. You get three gyoza for that one, I think.
So this next question then. Oh, there's another question from this guy as well. A couple of mailbag related questions for me.
Are you anxious about referring to either of the castles as Matheran again? How many Matherans did you have to edit at the final cut, the switch draft? I think I was tired that night and just did the one Matheran, so not like a huge problem.
Yeah, that was all from Hubert. So thank you for inflicting that on us.
Earlier on, you referred to the Castle family and it's so funny, when you said that I assumed you were talking about my wider family rather than me and Catherine are of a Castle family. Just an observation.
Yeah, and your cats. Well, I do think of you as the Castles, you know what I mean? Oh, okay.
Well, that's nice. Yeah, it is.
I think so. Oh god, I didn't prep an answer to this one. That was foolish, wasn't it?
Question for the large lads. You've been tasked with creating one of the radio stations, the GTA 6. What genre of music are you picking?
Which celebrity will you choose to voice to DJ? Feel free to name specific songs you want on the station. Did we not answer this quite recently?
I don't think so, because I was scratching my head over it and then I came up with an answer. I don't think I've said this before.
I think I'm thinking of the XL pod of Vice City when we came up with songs that weren't in Vice City that you would add to Vice City.
That's right.
That we'd add to a GTA 6 Vice City FM throwback station. That's what I'm thinking of. We've answered a question like this, but not this.
What have you got for this one? I'm tagging you in.
Tag me in. So, my radio station only plays iconic TV theme tunes that I like. And the DJ's Charlie Brooker.
Oh, right. I quite like that. That's good.
I think that would work. I think he's got the right tone and the right sense of humour for a GTA. Quite scathing, quite acidic, but also it's nice when they have the occasional British DJ thrown in the mix.
We're talking about things like the Cheers theme tune, the songs that play at the start of Pachinko, which I really like, the Grandstand theme tune, which is just an absolute banger. I think that would be good. I mean, they would never go for it.
It's far too nerdy for them.
Yeah, I love the idea of alongside probably music by the likes of The Who or Rod Stewart or whatever. You've just got the Grandstand theme tune in there. But you know what?
People would say it bangs. They would enjoy it.
Jumping off a mountain to the Grandstand theme tune or just driving down the coastal highway. That would fucking be brilliant.
I think that's a good suggestion. I don't think I could outthink Rockstar on this because they kind of come up with radio stations I didn't know I wanted and then I like them. Which is what happened with Radio Mirror Park and GTA V.
I love so many of the tracks that are on there. And I think that sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole of like sort of American indie circa the early 2010s to late 2010s and a few bands I got into off the back of that. So Rockstar know what's good for me with this, you know.
Have Depeche Mode ever been in a GTA?
Yeah, they're in, I think they might be in both Vice City Stories and San Andreas. I can't remember, I think Personal Jesus is in San Andreas and then Everything Counts is in one of them might be in Vice City Stories. So yeah, they've made the cut.
New Order, True Faith, they've made the cut. So yeah, they've actually like thought a bit about this before. I definitely think that an 80s radio station with GTA 6 is probably going to happen and that's the station I will immediately go to and see what made the cut that didn't get into Vice City itself.
I've said it before, but La Isla Bonita by Madonna is a peak Vice City style song. I think that should make the cut, Matthew, but they've never had Madonna in these games before, probably really expensive, so I don't know. Anyway, next question, you read this one.
Hello Giant Men. Long time listener, first time question asker. I would be interested to know the primary differences between working on an official magazine and an unofficial magazine, and particularly whether this has any effect on reviews.
For example, New Super Mario Bros 2 received 90% in O&M, 80% Nintendo Gamer and 7 out of 10 from GameSpot. Could you ever see an official Nintendo magazine like O&M feasibly giving a mainline Mario platformer, not a sports spinoff or similar, a score in the region of 70%? Was this something that ever particularly arose during your time in magazines?
Question for you, really, because I never worked on an official mag.
That's from Charlie Yolo Swag.
I think people assume that maybe the manufacturers were more hands-on than they were, especially the case with Xbox and PlayStation, but Nintendo were a little bit more hands-on, weren't they Matthew?
But they were hands-on, but only from a factual point of view. The only bit of magazine that they, I wouldn't even say they signed off on, that they checked was the news section, and I guess the covers and wallets as well. But it was always a factual pass.
There was nothing sort of qualitative about the remarks they were making. Honestly, I think if O&M wanted to give New Super Mario Brothers 80 percent, they absolutely could have. They would have been allowed.
That wouldn't have been a problem. Like, I don't think scores were policed. I think what does happen is there's a question of intended audience and what people necessarily want from a magazine.
I would say that, you know, if you're buying the official Nintendo magazine and, you know, you consider yourself, you know, oh, I love this official branded thing. It comes from the source itself. I think there is an element of willing things to be, wanting things to be as good as they can for your hobby and to be excited.
And I can understand, like, wanting to feed that further by being as generous as, generous as you can with the score. That isn't to say they overscored. I guess the extreme version of this is, a Nintendo mag isn't going to go out of their way to shit on Nintendo games, because then no one would buy that Nintendo mag.
That isn't part of the fun of celebrating the hobby. And, you know, NGamer gave plenty high scores as well. You know, we were slightly more irreverent.
There are certain things we didn't like, but then we, you know, we gushed as hard as O&M. We scored games higher than O&M all the time. One thing I will say for O&M in the period I was on it, and something we tried to do was kind of adjust score inflation a little bit in the redesign.
We changed it so that any game that got a 70% or above got a bronze award, any game that got an 80 or above got a silver, and then gold was 90 or above. And this may not have worked for people, but I thought it was quite a neat little concept in that it meant the games that were in the 70 category still got a flash of something going. This is an excellent game.
It was our attempt at saying a 7 out of 10 is still really good, which is quite hard to make people swallow that. You know, it doesn't sound particularly bold, but in a magazine where a lot of Nintendo stuff did get 9 out of 10s, I felt like we were able to drag some stuff down there. I think like Luigi's, the Super Luigi Brothers U, or whatever that was, the Luigi version of Super Mario Brothers U.
I think they got a 75 in official Nintendo.
Brutal.
It could happen, but you know, you still had this. Well, it still has this bronze award, and that probably didn't mean anything to anyone. And as a sign of where the readership was at, when we were slightly harsher with the scoring, that was the thing we got pushback about.
The only complaint I ever really received from the readers as editor was that we'd underscored Nintendo games. And it's like, oh, you're saying like, Luigi isn't an 80, or I think I gave New Super Mario Bros. U like an 84 or something, and someone's saying, well, a mainline Mario game, this should be a 90.
You should be giving this a 90, as a matter of course. And I think that's why it was like, oh, people just want to be told the thing they like is good at this level. And that's fine, but not particularly satisfying if you want to try and sort of interrogate something a bit more.
I think I agree with that more generally, that you are advocating for a platform when you're on a single format mag, no matter what. Definitely true when we're on PlayStation. It's not like we're running an op-ed every month saying the PS3 is shit, stop buying it and buy a 360, which is what would have been good advice at the time.
I didn't do what I did, but you are there because the people buying the thing are there to celebrate the format that they are invested in, the platform that they are invested in. You never know when the worm might turn, you might get something that's genuinely great and you want to celebrate it.
No, there isn't some secret rule that all things have to get 90 and O&M. Sadly, I know people would like to believe that. It's not true.
Well then, next question. We might be able to get through, for once, get through the fucking whole document of these and we sprint. So, let's do this one briefly.
Favorite game title? Asking Us I Can't Think Of A Better One Than Lovers In A Dangerous Space Time. That is a good name for a game, Matthew.
That's from Lexington.
Oh, shit, I didn't write one for this.
Well, I thought of a few that came to mind. There are so many good ones, I think, but Returnal, Deathloop, Splatoon. I like a pun title or a clever little concise one word title.
They came to mind as good ones. I think Days Gone is a good name for a game. I'm not saying the game is amazing, but you hear it and it evokes something.
I think Days Gone is similar to The Last of Us as a game name. It's like laterally talking about the thing that it actually is, in a slightly pseudo corporate poetic way. That's okay.
They came to mind straight away, Matthew. Obviously, Expedition 33, Clare Obscura, which I saw people slagging that game name off. I'm only joking.
It doesn't stop me from buying it.
It does make me laugh that it sings Clare Obscura in the thing tune. When you die, it's like, Clare Obscura. Could you not have picked an easy thing to sing?
Reading the word space time in Lovers in a Dangerous Space Time, the thing that popped into my head was Space Giraffe. That's quite a fun name for a game.
That's pretty good, isn't it? Yeah, I like that. Breakout, that's a good name for a game.
Yeah, I really like the land, world, galaxy, odyssey convention of the 3D Mario games. I do like the idea of a bigger, bigger landmass. It's getting bigger and bigger, like where will he go next kind of thing.
Turns out he'll go and turn into Donkey Kong.
He's going to go next. I was going to say actually that Zelda, generally speaking, those games have pretty amazing subtitles. Generally speaking, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Breath of the Wild, Oracle of Seasons, Oracle of Ages, those are all pretty great game names.
They feel very well thought out. I'm not saying Rosie, Rupee, Tingle, Land or whatever is necessarily in the same tier, Matthew, but the mainline Zelda games certainly have it. Yeah, yeah.
All right, next question. Do you want to read this one, Matthew?
Dear the two large gentlemen, I was just reading an interview with the celebrated composer Hans Zimmer, in which he says when composing a film score, he writes for a fictitious Bradfordian single mum of two named Doris, making it his mission to ensure she has an amazing experience if she puts her hard earned money down to go to the cinema. This begs the question, when planning and recording your pods, do you have an imagined listener in mind? Do they have a name?
What do they look like? What is the platonic ideal of a Back Page podcast listener? And how does it differ from actuality?
That's from Queeg.
I mean, Doris, huge dune head, first of all. Loved Dune Part 2. Can't wait for the next Dune Messiah.
She's Doris is well up for that. Logging Dune 2 on Letterboxx four and a half stars. I don't know if that was true about Hans Zimmer.
That's quite interesting if that is true. I think I always just imagine very mild-mannered, probably middle-class men going to their jobs listening to this podcast. Maybe they stop at a service station and get a sausage sandwich from Gregg's and a scoldingly hot coffee or something like that.
I mean, I'm not saying that's the platonic ideal. This is what I imagine a lot of our podcast listeners are like. Just you get a certain picture from the Discord, don't you, of a certain age bracket, maybe like our age and above and primarily blokes, but not just blokes.
Yeah, I don't know about ideal. Like I don't really dream of, honestly, game developers listening to the podcast is the thing I'm most flattered by. That's a nice idea.
Like it's when someone at a studio I won't mention told me that like they're in a group chat where like she'd worked with me before and a bunch of people are going, oh wow, you know Samuel, you work with Samuel. It was very flattering that people, I think her mind was blown that people knew what my dorky podcast was, which was otherwise the subject of like light to ridicule, which is completely fair for how preposterous it is.
Yeah.
We do do gamescore after all. So that kind of comes to mind, Matthew. Developers are like ideal, but I don't know if I really picture it otherwise.
Yeah, there's like a vanity thing with developers, like the idea that if you can kind of cut the mustard with someone who actually knows what they're talking about, then you must be doing something all right. Because I just feel like from following developers on social media, so many of them are pissed off at people misunderstanding games or misunderstanding the business or the intention behind them. And listen, I know I've said loads of dumb things, which are very wide of the mark on this pod, but hopefully we don't put our foot in it that much.
I mean, boringly, I often imagine our listeners are quite like you or I, specifically you for me, because you're the person I'm talking to. So I figure if I can get you interested in a thing or surprise you with a fact, or make you laugh about something, that's probably a good sign that it's a good bit of content. I don't want to call this an ideal, but I do think the podcast is probably more rewarding.
The more formats and things you've played over the time. I sometimes worry that if you only like Nintendo, and you listen to this because you know me from my Nintendo days, I wonder how the Xbox, PlayStation PC stuff goes down. Ideally, it's still interesting for them, but I do wonder if sometimes someone who was lucky enough to have a varied diet of games, probably a games journalist to be honest, gets a little bit more out of it.
Switch 2 out this year, though, we'll do a bunch of pods about that.
Yeah, I've been hankering to talk more about Nintendo, definitely.
Just tell me what you want to make. I'll just put in the podcast schedule. You literally have that power, Matthew.
Oh, yeah, no, not as a criticism, more from a... I feel like I've shared a lot of my juicy Nintendo takes, and just because my memory is so shit, I just have to replay so much stuff to refill the tank.
Yeah.
But I'm doing that with Metroid this year, and that will be fun, and Switch 2 will obviously be super relevant, and we can talk loads about that. So I'm happy with the listeners we've got. They seem like very reasonable people.
Yeah, they seem pretty into it. No complaints.
Some of them are a bit too obsessed with what we eat.
Oh, yeah, Damson's. That was a subject of much debate. I genuinely didn't know what a Damson was.
I mean, I don't have to tell you, really. Okay, I'm going to do these last four in kind of like rapid succession, Matthew. Then we'll come back to the Tom Cleaver one because I think that's quite a good one to end with.
As gaming professionals, what is your relationship with social media? I notice you shout out Blue Sky rather than Twitter now and I can imagine why. But do you feel like you have to maintain a social media personality as part of your jobs?
If it weren't for your careers, would you leave social media? Or does it bring more to your gaming lives than it takes away? Loving the pod, that's some Slayer disco.
I think you and I probably have similar relationships with social media, Matthew.
Yeah, I feel like I still check it obsessively, but I actually use it less in terms of I don't post that much these days. I'm very like, not protective or selective, but I've just had too many bad experiences or seen too much shit on there. I get quite, not nervous about posting, but I second-guess a lot my posting, basically.
Yeah.
I maybe only post like, if once a day. I'm not even sure that, really.
Yeah. I remember, I had an experience at the end of last year where I was like, oh God, I remember now why I fucking hate these platforms on Blue Sky, where I posted about how a thousand X resists was on a bunch of games you might have missed this year list. I thought I was slightly bogus because so many outlets had talked about that being one of the best games as one of the highest rated games on Metacritic and some twats, a message to me saying, you're in a bubble, you're in a fucking bubble.
Basically, this entire feed was like angrily responding to people like on Blue Sky. And I was like, God, these people still fucking exist. These fucking losers.
I just…
I had a day with that promised mascot agency tweet where it was basically linking back to a Guardian article because something was happening in Japan that reminded me of something in the game. And to some random, not a follower or anything, they replied to the Guardian link with a screenshot of the Guardian homepage with a, like, enable cookie message pop up. And they were like, uh, yeah, how about no?
Fuck off.
Oh, well, yeah, you see, the thing is, I'm not the fucking Guardian. I didn't put that on there. Also, people who get upset about that stuff, they really need to shut the fuck up.
It's very boring. I don't care if you believe in it. That guy was, like, Insta-blocked.
Why would you think I want to hear your boring, boring remarks about something like this?
Oh, I've been a...
Toilet person.
Yeah, exactly. I've been on social media so long now that if that had happened 10 years ago, right, I'd be like, oh, god, that's annoying. Don't you just fucking hate Twitter?
And now, now I'm like, I wish I could fucking like nuke this person with a space laser like immediately. I like I'm so intolerant that anyone like that. I'm like, let's just fucking get them out of humanity stats.
And that's what like social media has done to me. Just too many successive years of like balance and dimensions, you know? So, yeah, I guess that's probably like tells the whole story, really.
I like using it to make jokes so still and observations about things I like. That's not really changed, you know? Same for you?
You know, I'll never be a prolific tweeter. I just haven't got it in me.
Yeah, I use it sporadically as well. There are some days where I just don't look at it and don't post. And then there are some days where I'll post loads in a row.
I had a lot of like Revenge of the Sith bants like this past weekend because they re-released it. I just like making fun of like shit Star Wars things. So, you know, it will happen.
But yeah, I don't know if I did work professionally, I just don't think anyone would read my stuff. And I probably would. The lack of engagement would probably kill my interest in it.
And I'd probably go and live a slightly healthier life. Or I'd just stare at the ceiling and not really do anything. Who could really say what I'd do with the time?
So, yeah. Okay. Good answer to that one.
Which Mary Cart character would you like as a passenger for a minimum six hour drive, Matthew? That's from an improved vegetable tart.
Easy. The Opulent Boo from Mary Cart World. He's seen the other side.
That's interesting. We can talk about that. Maybe he'll turn me to Team Believer.
And he's probably got like good rich people stories. He's just kind of run with a higher class of people. And like you may hate that shit, but like they get up to hijinks that just aren't available to the rest of us.
And that's interesting.
That's a great answer. Again, tag teaming in there, I think, because all I wrote out was Toad, because I quite like Toad.
Toad's the one I'd like to least go for a car ride with. Because all he does is squeak and panic.
Oh, but they're great noises. I find them so adorable.
You've got to assume that I'm driving, which would be horrible for me, because I'm so bad at driving. You know, I'm a nervous driver. I haven't driven for like 20 years.
I don't want to be trying to do manoeuvres for the first time in two decades and hear a voice going, oh no.
Is Catherine driving, you in the back, and Toad in the passenger seat?
But then Toad's arms aren't long enough to touch the radio. This is a disaster.
You can always control it on Spotify with your phone. Anyway, I think that's a good answer to that question. Angry Kurt asks, actually you asked this one, Matthew.
Hi Samuel and Matthew. The Switch 2 reveal has been met with quite a few complaints and issues around various things. So it got me thinking, which console reveal and launch would you class as being the most successful in terms of there being the fewest complaints or questions still to be answered following its reveal and run up to launch?
Okay. I made a terrible mistake here. This is a fucking really long answer to give people.
So I'm going to just briefly say that the original Switch had it going on, Matthew. Breath of the World at launch. You knew Mario game was coming.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe dropped soon after. I mean, they had the stuff. You knew what it was about.
The reveal got people excited. Tiny bit of like analyst skepticism, but then the console completely delivered. That jumps out to me as like the recent history great launch.
I don't think either the PS5 or the Series X had great launches or anything. Miles Morales and Demon's Souls are pretty good on PS5. That's a pretty good name.
I think PS4 is a pretty successful and great launch. Not necessarily the launch line up in terms of here's this game, it's console, it's only about the games. We absolutely got to dunk on Xbox.
It seemed very clean, very simple.
Yeah, I think that's a good suggestion. Okay, that's a brief answer, Kurt, but I think it does tick that one off. Certainly, I think those launchers are better than the N64 launch, for example.
Very, very like, pared down. Not many games for a long time. Okay, hi S&M, do you think the podcast has got just a bit more horny since you made me mod slash admin of the Discord, the best waifu option in the PlayStation anniversary episode for one example, if so, sorry.
That's from our moderator, Betamax Bandit. I don't think we've gotten any horny. What was the thing we mentioned on the XXL?
That was it. You talked about Anna Friel in Pushing Daisies, and very rarely, there will be a crack in the armor, and you'll share a detail like that, Matthew. But generally speaking...
I think Anna Friel is beautiful in Pushing Daisies.
Yeah, exactly. It's not really horny.
Oh, how salacious. It's not like I shared some weird... Well, whatever.
No, we don't really horndog. We present it objectively. Do you know what I mean?
Like, that's really all we really do.
We very much admire you, my lady.
Yeah, I think I've described people as striking.
Strike?
I want to say they're attractive without horndogging. I remember I described Johnny Depp's daughter as striking at some point, because I was like, right, I definitely don't want people to think I find like a teenager attractive. But I also want to make this same point without canceling myself.
So that's kind of what I went with. But I don't think it's got any horny-er, like, are there many horny-er? I think Barbara Hershey Chat in the Right Stuff XXL episode, about as horny as it's ever really got on this podcast, what do you think?
Yeah, I mean, the idea that our hornyest episode ever was about the right stuff.
Subs it up, doesn't it, really?
I mean, Christ.
Yeah, OK, so I think probably like maybe like 1% hornier, but not really, you know, which is still not a horny podcast officially. Last question, Matthew, what you do ask this one, and I'll answer it very quickly, the big Tom Cleaver one.
Dear Samuel and Matthew, greetings. I am Honjo, the main character from Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. As you know, my game and its seven mysteries continue their dread march of conquest across the cultural and mental landscape of this podcast.
But I am fascinated by the particular sway the game appears to hold over Samuel, a man who has never played it. More than anything else, I am desperate to know what, without looking anything up and without being given any informational hints of any kind, Samuel thinks the actual mysteries of Honjo are. Samuel, please describe any one of the seven mysteries of Honjo.
You have three guesses. Matthew, adopting absolutely the most generous possible interpretations of his answers at every stage, please award one point for each correct guess. Your time starts now.
Honjo, kind regards, Honjo, aka Tom Cleaver.
Yeah, okay. I've really transitioned to more of the Honjin murders lately, just because I think you've mentioned that book a few times, isn't there a game based on the book?
Yeah, it's just come out, I haven't played it yet.
Yeah, so that's like in my mind now is like one of the, you know, I'm just, the Crooked House Murders. A lot of these like things I've heard Matthew talk about multiple times are swishing around. Okay, mysteries of Honjo.
I'm just going to say in advance, this assumes that I remember what the seven mysteries of Honjo are.
Okay, so a schoolgirl mysteriously falls to her death in a public place, Matthew.
No.
Okay.
That is not a mystery of Honjo.
A ghost haunts some kind of like ancient building, but it's the modern day.
I mean, I mean, that's vague, but I mean.
And you've got to find out what happened, why is there actually a ghost there? And that's one of the mysteries.
I mean, there are like, I don't know if there's ghosts per se, but there's definitely traditional buildings and like bad, bad vibes.
Yeah, okay. A locked room mystery where an old man has died, but you can't work out why.
No, that isn't the mystery of the Honjo, I'm afraid.
Okay, so I get half a point out of three? Is that it?
Yeah, you get half a point out of three. I'll just say the seven mysteries of Honjo, they're all urban legends, so they're quite specific. You know, like one of them is, if you go to the river at a certain time of day, a ghost fisherman will steal your baby or something.
No, it's all that kind of stuff. The chances of you hit happening on something that specific was very unlikely.
Yeah, that was not going to happen, was it? Well, anyway, it was a fun question. So thank you.
Thank you, Honjo. I appreciate that.
Would you say that you're team skeptic when it comes to the seven mysteries of Honjo?
Team confused, that's me. Team bewildered. OK, good questions, Matthew.
I think I enjoyed going through those. I think that was a pretty lively.
And we actually finished the doc.
We did.
First time this ever happened.
