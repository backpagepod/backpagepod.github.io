Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another episode of PC Gaming Classics, aka The Backer Page Podcast. I am Phil Iwaniuk, and with me as always is my longtime friend and esteemed games journalist, the Alex Turner of UK Games Journalism. It's Jeremy Peel, everyone.
Hello, Jeremy.
Hello, I thought you were introducing me as Alex then. I thought you'd forgotten my name. Hello, everyone.
Hello, Phil. You all right?
I'm all right, thanks. But yeah, I'm trying to make that a thing, that you're the Alex Turner of...
Yeah, you've said it more than once.
Exactly, yeah. And if I keep saying it, maybe someone else will at some point. Jeremy, how are you, first of all?
What's been going on in your life and your world and your career?
I'm good. I'm coming out the end of a cold. That's very exciting to hear about.
It's not even one or just sort of a chesty cough or...
It's one of those that's travelled, you know. I think it began as more of a sinus type thing. At a certain point, it was in the throat.
Yeah, I've been tracking its movements. It's been slow burn. Yeah, and I'm still playing XCOM.
Wow, because I dropped that like a hot potato once that episode was done.
I'm still in the same campaign. Yeah. Oh, wow.
Yeah, I feel like I'm nearing the end. I feel like I'm actually going to get there.
Of the cold or the XCOM campaign.
Both. Both. They've gone hand in hand.
Both slow burn.
One needs to happen before the other.
Uncomfortable experiences. Yeah. Yeah.
I can't say too much about how XCOM is going because I'm writing something on it for Edge and I know Alex Spencer of Edge will be listening and I'll lose my commission if I...
He's made you sign an NDA, has he?
Spill it all here. Yeah.
They have a tough enough job with people downloading the PDFs, don't they? They don't need you spilling the beans on your Edge feature before it even goes to the print.
Or just putting all the scores of an issue into a Reddit thread. Yeah. And then people just raging over them without any context.
That's what the editors of Edge enjoy.
Just boiling down a month's incredibly hard work into just a few bullet points. Yeah. I used to sort of take it as a bit of a compliment.
When I was on official PlayStation mag, if we ever got mentioned in NeoGaff or the likes of that, I was like, well, it looks like people are reading it. Someone's bought a copy.
It is actually like, yeah, tangible effort in the way that just linking something through the internet isn't to actually buy a magazine and find the relevant bits and then type them into your computer for the consumption of others. That does involve an element of caring, doesn't it?
It's edifying because you really feel like you're just throwing the words down a black hole sometimes on a mag because there isn't that instant engagement. Incidentally, we used to also play this game where we'd buy in all the rival mags from outside future when I worked at various mags in future, and they would come in and then you'd play a game where you'd try to guess the review scores in each issue and you would always make a point of all the scores being wrong. And we used, we did this with Games TM actually when probably when Samuel was on there, and it's just such a sort of puerile bit of playground and be like, oh, you never got something given Saints Row the third, go on, six.
Oh, we gave it a five. Oh, they're so wrong. You just do that page for page and just feel like, oh, we got it all right.
And, you know, somehow, yeah, that makes them all those scores are empirically incorrect. And I'm sure that Games TM were doing the exact same thing. Oh, the latest OPM is in.
This will be a good laugh. Let's see, Saints Row the third, six.
Are you mad? I missed that direct comparison between mags. I know when I was just trying to get into games journalism, and there was a month where I bought like every UK games mag.
And this was, you know, fairly shortly before a bunch of them closed down. But I was reading, you know, the same previews or different takes on the same preview opportunities to the point where I could tell which information they each got from the same event, and how they'd used it differently, which is a sort of level of, you know, almost creepy analysis of games journalism that I hope readers don't normally do. But I do kind of miss that ability to kind of see like, oh, you know, Edge has done this with it, PC Gaming has done this with it, and, you know, official Xbox Mags done that, because they're often all drawing from the same material.
Yeah, access was super limited. Certainly in my day, like the sort of late 20, well, all of the 20 times really. Yeah, the access were just nothing.
Like, you'd be right in a tiny preview of a press release. This is something that Matt Lees used to talk about, how he would notice that the wording of those press releases just gets in your brain, and then he would see the exact wording pop up in previews everywhere. Like, I think for Dishonored, the first Dishonored, like, how many times have you read Supernatural Assassin?
Or In the Darkness? There was something about the way the press release talked about the quad wielding mechanic in the darkness, too. I mean, these are quite deep cuts that I'm referencing here, you know.
Admittedly. But that wording just seeps into your brain and, like, you've, you know, you've only got that information in the press release and some screenshots to try and weave this, like, essentially, this lie that you've, like, you've gone and played the game and spoken to the devs. And so, yeah, you notice that the wording in those press releases just pops up all over the place and it does work.
That's like the same Madman, isn't it, Jeremy? That's the thing, the best thing about advertising is that people think it doesn't work.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'll tell you what the weirdest example of that was that I've noticed is, can you help me remember the name of this game? There's something of Ethan Carter.
The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.
The Vanishing, yes.
By the astronauts, is that what they're called? Adrian...
Yeah, yeah.
I've backed myself into a corner here because I'm not 100% sure how to pronounce his name.
You're trying to pronounce the...
Adrian Kmiliartz? Oh god, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to look it up.
I'm so sorry. Adrian?
Kmielartz, I would say.
Yeah.
If anybody is... Yeah, if anybody's Polish or speaks Polish that listens, then get in touch on the Discord and let us know if I'm pronouncing that right or not. Kmielartz.
Do carry on, do carry on.
Yeah, he's quite a controversial figure now for his...
He is.
His internet-based opinions. Very much so. But at the time, that wasn't really the case.
And, you know, I was one of many people who reviewed that game. And I remember in the intro to that game, it gives you a sort of text, black screen, white text. This game won't hold your hand effectively is what it says.
And I remember that appearing in the intros of multiple reviews. I felt like it was a form of brainwashing because it was like, it was not a particularly complex or difficult game. You know, it's a walking simulator.
Like it has its moments of puzzle or what have you. But, you know, it's basically just fed to us and people would then come out with it. So I think that was the most egregious example of that, that I can remember, because it didn't really match what the experience was.
Yeah, absolutely. I'm going to close down this tab of pictures of Adrian Camille Arts now, because it's not pertinent to this episode. We're going to be talking this episode.
We haven't mentioned yet. This episode is about Jurassic Park Trespasser, Jeremy. I'm so excited about this one.
It's definitely the most divisive of all the games we've covered so far. And there is a particular backstory to this, right?
I mean, even putting this game under the banner of a series called PC Gaming Classics is controversial. But it is fascinating.
Obviously, it's a licensed game based on Jurassic Park, but it's not really like any other Jurassic Park game you could play. It was directed by Seamus Blackley and Oster Grossman as lead designer. And these are both people who had come from Looking Glass and worked early on on System Shock 1.
And Seamus Blackley in particular was a physics genius. Still is, right?
It's not something that you lose over time, is it?
No. And now he's known as the father of Xbox, right? He was kind of instrumental in making that console happen in the beginning.
But back then, yeah, he was the guy who... And I've been interviewing some people from Looking Glass recently for something about System Shock and writing for Rock Paper Shotgun. And a few of the people I talked to have mentioned Seamus and him.
Like he would just, in his office, he would have a simulation of a bouncing ball that just kind of ran perpetually, that he would work on endlessly because that was like the fundamental simulation, right? Yeah. He was just obsessed with cracking like this perfect realistic physics simulation.
He worked on Flight Unlimited, which is Looking Glass' best game. Is it?
It might be, to be honest, for all I know about it. I just, I always think of it as like the outlier, right? Because Looking Glass is obviously famed for all those incredible im sims.
And then there's just like, oh, let's make a flight sim in the midst of it all.
Yeah. And it makes sense. You know, it's like, it's the same kind of approach to like, oh, let's simulate how this avatar moves in as perfect a fashion as we can.
But instead of a human body, obviously, it's a plane. And there are stories of him working on that. And, you know, a tester doing something like flying a plane in a certain position and it's stalling or something.
And him bringing up like a world class pilot he knew to confirm, like, if you do this in this plane, does this happen? And they'd be like, oh, yeah, yeah. He's like, okay, great.
Like, that was the kind of level he was operating on. And all of that...
Developing by telephone.
And all of that energy and obsession came to Trespasser, right? I'll let you pick up the story there, Phil.
Sure. Well, the most important bit of backstory as far as this podcast is concerned is that Trespasser was essentially like the swing vote in the PC Gaming 90s draft in our parent podcast, The Back Page. So when Samuel and Matthew were divvying up the classic 90s games, Matthew went with Trespasser and it ended up sort of winning him the entire draft, much to Samuel's chagrin.
And I believe we have a clip of it, I mean, talking like we're doing it live. What we'll do is hours or perhaps days after recording this, drop in a clip of that happening, which you will hear now.
So we come to my last pick, Matthew.
Well, I've got my wild card.
Oh, sorry. Yeah, of course. You got one last pick.
What to do with this?
This is a tricky one because, like... Please pick Minesweeper. What is a true wild card?
What is really odd? I'll tell you what I'm going to pick. I'm going to pick the grand folly that was Jurassic Park Trespasser.
I'm going to pick the grand folly that was Jurassic Park Trespasser.
And there it was. What a moment.
That was a particularly funny episode. I think because Matthew felt a little out of his depth with the kind of early PC stuff. Although I maintain that Matthew's out of his depth is still, you know, other people's expertise.
It's just he holds himself to a higher standard than anyone else I know. But yeah, like it is funny that like Trespasser came up in that context when it's more notorious than famous, I would say, right?
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. It's, you know, the personal context for me is that I, God, I was obsessed with Jurassic Park and particularly The Lost Water.
It was just, it was an open goal for me. So I was actually really shocked that its reputation was as divisive. Like it was sort of critically more than I was like, what are you on about?
It's Jurassic Park. But yeah, lots of things. It was a very unusual project from, in terms of how everyone went about it, in terms of how it was staffed.
So this was DreamWorks Interactive, which came about because Steven Spielberg, I think, was watching his son play GoldenEye and was like, these video games, they're going somewhere, you know? So maybe we should pay attention to video games. So, you know, being Steven Spielberg, it was like, let's just chuck a few million into a video game studio.
And that was an extremely brief and perhaps not very accurate version of how DreamWorks Interactive came to be. It's probably best known for starting Medal of Honor, which in turn, you know, is the forefather of COD. And so one of the most influential and important moments in the games industry.
But before that, they managed to secure, Seamus Blackley specifically managed to secure a movie tie-in deal for the upcoming Jurassic Park sequel. So this was originally supposed to be the Lost World, the game. And it ultimately buckled under the weight of its ambition.
And that's what makes it such a fascinating game, is because it was so unusual. And it's almost a bit of outsider art. Not to say that, you know, Austin Grossman and Seamus Blackley are outsiders by any means, but some of the other, you know, senior members of the team had come from all over the place, from Disney, essentially, you know, more like, well, people involved in building Disney World and in animating and illustrating the movies.
So just fascinating. And it's Jurassic Park as well, isn't it? And so I'm just absolutely buzzing for this one.
And I think it's going to be maybe the most interesting, like, 90s games court that we've done so far, because previously they really have all been absolute classics. And there's not really much, like, ongoing debate about whether they're actually any good or not. Everyone's like, yeah, do you know what?
You know, System Shock 2 is really good. I don't know. I mean, we both know Ben Barrett.
Shout out to Ben Barrett, who is the absolute custodian of... I don't want to say contrarian opinions, Jeremy. That's not quite fair, is it?
But he looks at games in a different way. And I don't think he truly believes that any good games were made before 2003. But I've not even heard Ben Barrett say that System Shock 2 isn't good, nor any of the other games we've mentioned on this list.
However, Trespasser doesn't have that same legacy or reputation. So it will be an interesting one to get into.
Yeah, yeah. In fact, I had Ben Barrett, who was a former colleague of ours at PC Games N, when I tweeted about XCOM earlier this week, he replied enthusiastically. So that's a game from 1994 that he was getting behind.
Well, I wonder if he's been playing the 2012 version.
And why wouldn't you, really? Unless you had a particular attachment to... I don't think Ben's brain and perhaps a lot of people's brains fire off the same absolute influx of serotonin and dopamine when they see MS-DOS graphics as happens to our brain chemistry.
We are unusual in that regard. That's certainly true.
We are. And I don't know how personally I managed to keep getting work in the industry because all my frames of reference are so wrong.
There's always an anniversary coming up, right? All of these things are coming up to their 20th year anniversary.
Yeah, remasters and retrospectives. That's my brain. Absolutely.
Well, let's get a little bit into the story of this. Critically, when it arrived, it was absolutely panned. It didn't sell very well either, which was a bit of a disaster because it had gone over budget and way past schedule several times.
So this really was the end for certainly any franchise ideas. But I think it was also the beginning of... This came out in 1998 and it was probably one of the games that informed a more risk averse and sensible games industry going forward.
It started to become less feasible to just throw ideas into a big bucket and see what comes out and see if it sells. So October 28th, 1998, this made it out. The Lost World came out.
The Lost World movie came out in, I think, May 1997. So, you know, that's bad, isn't it? I was stressing recently because I'd done a particular review and there'd been like some problems with the code and then a bit of a miscommunication.
And, you know, in the end, the review that I submitted was, you know, a couple of weeks after the fact. I felt terrible about it. But I mean, that's nothing compared.
There's nothing compared. Do you have that Lost World game, guys? Because it's going to cinema.
Like, it's going to be in cinemas in May. So like, how are you getting on with it? Is it done?
And they're like, yeah, get in there, get in there. Did you want it actually like in May when it's? Well, yeah, ideally.
OK, well, what if we don't call it like The Lost World? What if we release it a year and a half afterwards?
And yeah, I mean, I said to you, didn't know what's up, but it feels it absolutely stinks of a game that these numbers won't be accurate, but it feels like it was prototyped intensely for four years and then level designed for four months. Like, it feels like the actual game bit was thrown together after, like, an incredibly beautiful, long experimental period. Whereas actually those, you know, those periods probably should have been, the ratio should have been a little more even.
Probably, probably. So, yeah, they had the movie license. And I think actually, ultimately, they used that movie license quite well.
Because I'm not sure I would have wanted to play through, like, to be Jeff Goldblum and, you know, or to be Julianne Moore and, like, to be, you know, just replaying the scenes from the movie. I think it's more interesting. So in this game, you play a plane crash survivor who just happens to wash up after her plane crashes on the shores of Isla Sauna, which, of course, is Site B, where InGen have been breeding all the dinosaurs that they then ship over to the neighboring Isla Nublar, part of the Cinco Muertes, the Five Deaths, he says.
They call the islands the Cinco Muertes. What does that mean? The Five Deaths, he says.
Where, you know, where Jurassic Park itself, the tourist facing bit of the business, was based. And this is just after everyone has already shipped out and the project has been abandoned, which is, you know, a canny bit of, you know, resource saving from a development perspective, because it means there are no humans to have to animate and very little dialogue.
Which, by the way, is exactly how System Shock worked, right? Like, they'd come up and that was built to be, you know, this fictional world where it made sense that there weren't any NPCs and nobody was easily contactable. And that's exactly how Trespasser works as well.
Your goal is to ultimately contact help, you know, find a way off the place, but there's nobody there. And it has this really sort of, it's quite a compelling, lonely atmosphere. I would say, like, obviously there's an aspect to Jurassic Park, which is rollicking adventure and sort of grandeur and excitement of seeing dinosaurs roaming about.
And I don't know if Trespasser quite captures that. It's going for something a little sideways. It's more of a sort of slightly terrifying trek through an abandoned space, you know, in some respects.
Where there are just hours and hours of almost silence and just exploration.
Slightly empty, open-ish worlds.
Yeah, that's what it feels like. We're used to that now, but like in 98, the expectation was if it's a first-person perspective, there's got to be rollicking adventure. So it felt very sparse at the time.
And it was probably disappointing to a lot of people that there weren't any other humans. There were no drivable InGen Jeeps or anything like that. And it was like the show had sort of packed up and left long before the game begins.
Which, yeah, I think you're absolutely right. That is the same set up in System Shock. Plenty of games have used that to great effect.
I think because what's left in the absence of other people and Roller King Adventure is so sparse, it obviously doesn't work quite as well in Trespasser.
Yeah, it did occur to me as well, speaking of Ethan Carter, that this, you know, corporate sheet outs with velociraptors aside, this plays and feels like a walking simulator as we understand them today. So the set up for the way the story works is that the protagonist Anne, she figures out where she is because by this time there's been, you know, whole public investigations into the disaster of Jurassic Park and John Hammond is kind of this notorious figure who got this thing terribly wrong and she's read his memoir at some point and as she roams about this place, passages of this... She's got a very strong memory, Anne.
Passages from John Hammond's memoir come unbidden into her head and they just sort of play in Richard Attenborough's voice and I really like that aspect of the game actually. I think... So it's written by Austin Grossman who is now a novelist.
I happen to be reading one of his currently which is called Crooked and it's a supernatural thing but it's written from the perspective of Richard Nixon and Austin has this real talent for kind of writing in the voice of deeply flawed but kind of honestly flawed characters who kind of own up to their mistakes and that's quite like a really kind of alluring headspace to enter into and he did exactly the same thing with John Hammond where he's kind of... he's in this very reflective mode of like talking about what we did with Jurassic Park and he's kind of... you can hear the pride and these kind of like whimsical recollections about things they were working on and he does a gloss over what went wrong either and he's kind of thinking about how he was almost one of the great figures of the 20th century but instead became one of its most horrendous failures instead.
He had funded and pushed to make these incredible breakthroughs happen in bringing back extinct creatures and then kind of lost control of the whole thing. And yeah, I don't know about you, but I ended up looking forward to those little snippets of Richard Attenborough mumbling over the action, especially when I had to walk long distances over terrain at quite a slow pace.
Well, exactly. It's feast or famine, isn't it? So when, like, usually it happens when you crest a hill, you see a new area in front of you and some music kicks in and you're like, oh my God, like something new is about to happen.
Maybe this is where the game starts. But like incredible production values, right? Like, you know, for all the flaws in the game itself mechanically and structurally, there's a score behind all of those memoirs as you hear them from Hammond that is like cinema quality.
And I don't know whether even it's a bit of John, it can't be John Williams, can it? No, the composer was Bill Brown, but he does a fantastic John Williams impression. It feels of a piece with The Lost World and the original Jurassic Park scores and the instrumentation is like there are some returning motifs that sort of mimic the dinosaur sounds, right?
In the score, it sort of sounds like roars and it's incredibly evocative. And again, only Spielberg could make this happen, but the memoirs that you're hearing, the recollections you're hearing from Hammond, that's Dickie Attenborough. He's the real guy.
And Annie, the castaway on the island, is Mini Driver, which just wouldn't happen these days, or certainly not.
She puts in a strong performance as well. It's unusually good results for celebrity castings, isn't it?
Yeah, absolutely. I think I've heard some people slate Mini Driver's performance in this game, but I think it's great. I think it is very like, very earnest.
It really draws you into her experience. Yeah, incredible. I think you're absolutely right.
There's a bit of walking sim about it all. And yeah, I'd like to take that to the Chinese room and see if they recognize the direct lineage between Trespasser and DOS. Certainly, Jessica Curry's score and the little dash of reverb on the narration in DOS, it's all there.
I can see a three line.
It's impossible, when you're playing this game, it's impossible not to sort of cast forward, partly because it's so unrealized and messy in this form. But you're constantly going, oh, this is doing stuff that Far Cry did but a few years earlier. And yeah, I forget what else I was gonna say about it.
We've already talked about, not just walking sims, but like survival sims. We'll get on to the physics and how that works later on. But it's been often sort of described as walking so that Half-Life 2 could run.
So there is a ton of influence in here.
Failing to think of. I remember Austin Grossman saying that he went to a talk that one of the Half-Life 2 developers did years later. And it was uncanny that they encountered all the same kind of problems and attempted to solve all the same problems in making these physics puzzles.
And obviously, more successfully at Valve. But yeah, it is uncanny at point. You know, oh yeah, this is something that everywhere you look in Trespasser, there's something that was done more successfully later and that nobody else was thinking to do in 1998, let alone 96 or God knows when they actually started on this project.
Yeah, I think a lot of that comes down to the fact that they didn't know not to do it, right? Again, it's that sort of outside of art thing. I think a team of really experienced game designers would know like, this is never going to work.
This ambition is too lofty. It needs to be cut from the features early doors. But I was reading there's a really good post-mortem from about 98 or 99 from one of the senior dev team about what went wrong, essentially.
And what they talk about is that a lot of the people at DreamWorks weren't experienced game devs. So they just didn't know that it was madness to try and get a working physics model up and running, or that the structure wouldn't work for a game of this type. And they also, they pivoted quite late on.
It was supposed to be a bit of a survival horror experience for a while. And they pivoted in and removed the horror elements from it like very late on. Again, you probably wouldn't do it that way.
You wouldn't make such a high level, wide reaching conceptual change, you know, months before shipping, if it was a team who were just like, you know, had 20 games already under their belts. So for example, the art director, Terry Izumi, was a designer at Tomorrowland, which is like part of Disney World Kingdom. And one of the animators, I will say the dinosaurs are fantastically animated for the time.
But the animator there, George Edwards, was an animator from the Disney movies. So it was a lot of people like from the wider Disney family, like getting involved in this Jurassic Park thing and not knowing what the outer limits were, the possibilities of the medium. And I'll get into it later on in the podcast, but that's why I love it really.
And I would always rather, as I've said before, I'd always rather a game tries and fails these things. And I'll put up with all sorts of shonky mechanics if there's some sense of it. There's a sense of atmosphere and immersion and place.
And I think they did achieve that. I think there is a sense of place here. But critics at the time didn't.
I remember that the PC Gamer review, who was it that reviewed it? I can't remember, but the score was 68%. And I was pretty outraged by that because I was, you know, 12 and obsessed with the Lost World Jurassic Park.
And I was like, what are you talking about? Like, I'm on an island and there are velociraptors. I simply don't understand.
But that was probably the median response was like fives and sixes across the board.
Yeah. And I think we've talked about before, like industry wisdom now is to innovate on one or two fronts. You know, like pick a mechanic that you are boldly going where others have never gone before with, or you are taking forward ever so slightly.
And that tends to result in more polished and finished feeling games. It also results in a lot of games that aren't remembered. And Trespasser is remembered because nothing it does was done the same way in other games of the period.
You know, like obviously we're going to get to talk about the arm. And you sort of pick up objects in the world. But even just like the interface, there's nothing on the screen.
It's entirely diegetic within the fiction of the world. So when you pick up a gun or switch to it and we'll say six bullets or feels half full. And to check on her health, she has a notoriously a tattoo, a heart tattoo kind of above her left breast.
So you look down, you can see a body and if it's kind of filled in with red, then you're in trouble. And if it's white, you're OK. And health regenerates, which was also a thing that wasn't popularized until Halo years later.
No health packs dotted around.
No health packs. And games like Dead Space and Mirror's Edge and Peter Jackson's King Kong would all do pretty amazing things with those ideas, but not until, in some cases, 10 years later or 8 years later. So these are all, in my head, these are all great ideas.
Like, I would not dispute a single one of them as an idea, but throwing them all in one game, when so much of it was unproven at the time, is by today's standards just is madness. It's not how games are made.
Only you would find a way to mention Peter Jackson's King Kong in another episode.
Yeah, fair play. I'll give you a pass on that one. Well, we'll get into our personal experiences with this.
As ever, we've replayed it with our modern minds, and we'll regale you with the tales of those experiences. But it's the time in the episode where we go into Review Wars. I'm stumbling because I'm thinking, do we need to talk about the Patreon, the Discord, your Patreon?
Do we need to do that before we get into Review Wars? Let's gear gate a little bit. Do you have any Patreon announcements, Jeremy?
Because in the last episode, you were toying with the idea of setting up a Patreon for your own work. So this is separate to the podcast. This is just if you enjoy Jeremy's writing, and why wouldn't you?
It's not always about Peter Jackson's King Kong. Then there was an idea of setting something up for those supporters.
Yeah. So yeah, I'm going to set up a Patreon for my own writing. As of now, it still isn't out there, but I'm inching closer to setting that live, making that happen.
It's good you prompted me to mention it because I'm working on the basis. The more people I tell about it, I just have to do it then, don't I? Because it's too embarrassing to not go through with it if I've told everyone.
Exactly.
I'm going to do it. I'm excited to do it. At some point soon, keep an eye out.
There'll be the Peel Perspective Patreon, where you can get exclusive articles from me, often about classic PC games, but also just whatever games fascinate me. Yeah, I'm going to build on that, do regular newsletters rounding up all the stuff I've written. And for other places in that particular month, and yeah.
Newsletters are really back in vogue for some reason, like marketing is all about newsletters now. I think newsletters is a bit of an early 2000s thing, but this, yeah, everyone's into newsletters. And I think that's really smart for just accumulating all your best work in a given month.
Because we write a lot. In order to make half a living as a freelance games writer, you actually put out a lot of content in a given month. So there's like, you can cherry pick some really good stuff.
In a year, either one of us could film a magazine. Couldn't wait just like purely with our own work. But that's not how you tend to think about it or because it gets fired out to different places.
So yeah, I think it'll be good and healthy to be able to point out like where all my stuff is and talk around it a little bit, the context of it and my thoughts on some of it. And yeah, if it's successful enough that I can keep going with it, then I'll do more, you know, do more per month. So my hope is that it might be something that can grow a little bit over time.
So if you are interested in the development of that plan, then you can follow Jeremy at Jeremy D. Peel on Twitter.
That's not my Twitter name. That's not it.
Is it not? Jeremy D. Peel?
Jeremy underscore Peel.
Why have I put a D in there?
Are you thinking of my email address?
Oh, yeah.
If you're interested, you can visit Jeremy's home at 49 Walkers Rise.
Just knock on the door day or night and he'll be happy to give you an update. Sorry for that data breach. Jeremy underscore Peel at twitter.com.
Is that right? Is that how you do Twitter?
No, I think you put it in twitter.com.
Do you have to ask Siri? Siri, show me Jeremy.
How are you this social media illiterate?
Okay, Google, show me Jeremy D Peel on Twitter.
I love this about you.
My day job is making social media content as well. I'm putting it on for effect. Or you can keep keeping the loop on the Backpage Discord as well where we also get some lovely messages from people who've enjoyed the previous episodes and some of those, Jeremy, I'll go through now because it's always nice and it strokes our egos.
For example, Bjorn says, might be my affinity for the game speaking, but the XCOM episode is the best PC gaming classics yet. Do hope you folks keep the series going after Trespasser. Well, good news Bjorn, we're definitely keeping going after Trespasser because we have a series finale which is Quake versus Half-Life.
It's true to be told, I don't think we're quite decided how to go about that yet. It's the end of the series, it's two massive games and we're deliberating whether to have a special guest in or not, even though we haven't done that so far in the series.
It's like the Sam Raimi Spider-Man 3 where he's got too many villains already fitting two games in, it's going to be busy. I think it's going to be great.
Yeah, so there will definitely be that. Truth be told, we haven't really figured it out yet. We enjoy doing these and I think we'd like to keep doing them.
So we'll have figured it out and we'll have something to say by the end of the Half-Life vs Quake episode basically, won't we?
Yeah, we'll have to. We'll have to figure it out then.
Also, shout out to your production skills, Jeremy. Bjorn continued, says, also not sure if you tinkered with the audio, but it was coming in much clearer than the previous app. So well done there.
I'm learning on the job.
We also have one from Coig, C-O-Y-G, who says he's belatedly finishing the PC Gaming Classics Episode on XCOM. Just wanted to pop in here and say that the Run the Jewels segment is one of the most chaotic yet brilliant things ever put out under the BPP stable. Please feel free to print this endorsement off on the era-appropriate continuous form printer paper and hand it to Phil Impersonable.
Jokes on you, Coig, because here I am.
Now is a good a time to mention as Eddie that you won the vote this time on Revuos. My feeling is that Run the Jewels won that for you.
Yeah, I feel bad about it because my...
You shouldn't feel bad. We didn't give listeners a venue to vote on how much they loved. Jewel Never Believe It, in fact, was the name of the segment, wasn't it?
Yeah, I think Run the Jewels is a better pun, isn't it?
But that was such a crescendo late in the episode. I think you were rightly rewarded for it, even if you effectively had two shots at the victory in that episode. You put in the extra effort.
You recorded versions of stroke songs with lyrics about, quotes from Julian Gollett talking about crustacean men in Phoenix Point. So I think that's very well-earned, if that is indeed why you won.
Well, spoilers, I'm looking in the G-Drive folder where we put our Review Wars audio clips to listen to as we make these episodes. There were additional things and I can see the name Ralph Fiennes. So Jeremy has taken that approach from that won me The Back Page Review War last episode, and seems to have run with it.
So I'm feeling nervous about Review Wars this episode, because it's one simple WAV file and it's not great. I was telling you early on this morning, wasn't I? I woke up at 6.30 this morning and realised that I hadn't done a Review War or thought about it, and so had to very hurriedly put something together.
So the odds are stacked against me this month.
I don't want to play up the extracurricular material I brought with me this time, but I thought it was about time I did.
Well, you wouldn't do it, would you? It minimised the impact if we really shone light on it.
But I wanted to first point out a comment from from Monkton as well, which I really enjoyed, which he gave us our perspective as a Gen Xer. And for him, you know, a big Laser Squad fan, a big fan of Julian Golop's early stuff in 8-bit on the Amiga and ST, X-COM was like a generational shift for him. You know, it went isometric, gone from a few scenarios in the turn-based battle to this entire globe of action where you could land a ship anywhere and you might get desert and you might get jungle and you might get whatever.
And that was astonishing. It came out in the same weekend as Ultima VIII, he points out. And with the 19-year-old's pay packet just stretching enough, I bought both.
Ultima VIII was a bit of a disaster, but UFO was a fucking triumph. I didn't even begrudge the dogfighting bits. Yeah, after actual years replaying the same favorite Laser Squad scenarios, there were eight in total, I think, UFO was just incredible.
Such an expansion on a truly fabulous core. And then he added a little diss at the end. And it really wasn't that difficult if you've been through Laser Squad.
Gen X condescending apology intensifies. So yeah, it's a little attack on us struggling through XCOM on its beginner setting.
I think that's better. Who was that from again? I enjoyed that.
That was from Moncton.
Moncton, thank you very much. Yeah, it's evocative to imagine popping down the shops and just seeing those two like pretty seminal or at least quite famous releases that just happened to be out the same week. You'd be like, well, we can sort it then.
Just guess I'll play them. Incredible. Well, if anyone isn't familiar with the concept of review wars yet in this podcast, this is where Jeremy and I do battle in the form of audio landscapes in which we narrate the opening paragraph of the review of this game as if it's always been difficult to describe, hasn't it?
Maybe it's just that I do it in a funny way. We imagine if we've been commissioned by the gaming mags of the day to write the review for this game. That would be incredible wish fulfillment.
And so then we write that intro to that review and then we jazz it up because this is a podcast with a bit of audio or music or whatever so that it sounds interesting. That's basically the concept, right?
Yeah, yeah. The intro to a 1998 review that's also a bit of a performance because audio, yeah. It makes sense when you hear it.
Well, I'm not sure it always does, does it? But it seems to be enjoyable at least. Because I always have a, I mean, my approach has wavered wildly from episode to episode, whereas yours has always been pretty much on brief.
You deliver something that's like annoyingly a really good bit of writing and like full of insight and you're like, oh, fuck's sake, you know. And then, so I just try and we're like, well, how can I shoehorn a funny accent or like do a bit of like production and try and win it that way? I've taken a different approach this, this month.
I've done a Phil this month, so.
Oh, fantastic. Good. So the roles are reversed.
Who went first last time? I think I went first last time, didn't I? So the rules dictate that you have, you have the floor, Jeremy, for this one.
So what would you like to, how would you like to introduce this one?
I would say that it's a piece for the stage. There are three parts and I've performed all of them.
OK, well, it sounds appropriately enough, very ambitious. Will it, like Trespasser, buckle under the weight of that ambition and just be a sort of interesting curio? Or will it finally win the acclaim and sales that Trespasser didn't?
Let's find out as we listen to Jeremy's entry for the Jurassic Park Trespasser review wars.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasser, as we forgive those who trespasser against us.
Lord, forgive dream works interactive, for they know not what they do.
Yes, forgive them, O Lord, for the, well, for the weird arm.
There's no other way to put it. They've invented a weird arm for their game, Jurassic Park Trespasser. They have created a body that is not in your image, O Lord, but rather a perversion of our human limbs, arms that cannot be steered sensibly nor clasped together in prayer.
It is an abomination.
It's true, O Lord. Forgive them too for the hubris of creating a free roaming island that was impossible to render properly.
When the prophet Ezekiel described to us the Garden of Eden, he said nothing about the texture popping. Lord, forgive Seamus Blackley for his obsessive commitment to physics. The lost sheep of Dreamworks Interactive have abandoned faith in favour of science, and their new religion has led them astray.
The puzzles aren't so bad, O Lord, but the movement speed alone is surely a crime against humanity.
My shotgun got stuck in the floor more than once. Forgive the level designers, O Lord, for scattering keycards around the island. For those keycards are tiny, and their placement total bullshit.
Yes, Lord, the only door they should be seeking to open is the Gate to Heaven. Forgive Steve-O-Spielberg for backing the release of such a project, when so many of its ideas are clearly unrealized. Indeed, if art seeks to pay tribute to the divine, then this half-empty canvas is an insult to the Almighty.
Although, in mitigation, O Lord, might we consider Trespasser's female protagonist and surprisingly well-composed story. In many ways, it may be ahead of its time, marred by the technology of its era, but going on to inspire ever more wonderful works of art.
Lord, he speaks to us. The light! It's blinding!
Lord, tell us what to make of the diegetic user interface. It's diabolical is what it is. I wouldn't be surprised if this game was bankrolled by him downstairs.
Surely not so, Lord. Is Addy's hands full making Diablo? Oh, I don't know.
I can't see everything, can I?
You can't, oh Lord?
Never mind that. Get back to your prayers and all those good works you do. I'm off to buy Half-Life.
Bye, Lord. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever and ever.
Amen.
What is Half-Life?
And how does it square with eternal life?
I don't know.
We're going to have to update the books, aren't we?
Jesus Christ. Why did you do that?
I honestly thought I thought something had gone wrong. I thought I'd like alt tabbed and brought up divinity or something. And it was like playing some NPC.
If you think there's been a mistake, would you play the latest review?
I'm equal parts. I've barely laughed during that. I feel a little bit scared of you now somehow, and I'm not sure why.
The key cards, their placement, total bullshit, was incredibly well done.
I've got to thank Dibko of freesound.org for the choir background there, which I think was recorded in a Slovenian church as far as I can tell.
It was very Norfolk Nights, the production of that. Oh, wow. I mean, listen, I know I say it every week, but you've won review.
Like, listen, everybody just vote for Jeremy this week, because that was extraordinary. Plus, we haven't even heard these Ralph Fiennes dot wavs yet. I mean, who knows what they're going to contain, but honestly, I'm not going to be offended.
I went through a hissy fit. Just vote for that one, because it's extraordinary. Mine is very meat and potatoes, Jeremy.
It's exactly what you would think to do if you woke up at 6.30 on the morning of recording the podcast and you're like, oh, shit, I've got to do a review was for Trespasser. Imagine that. Imagine where your mind would go, what you'd think, and then listen to this and go, yeah, that is what I would do as well.
So without further ado, apologies for my humiliating entry this month into the Jurassic Park Trespasser Review Wars. Well, do you know what? Since I have an extra bit of time to make some excuses, I would say my approach this time was like, because I've always envied the fact that yours do actually work as reviews, intros.
And I thought it would be good to have a go at doing that. But then I thought the thing is about yours though, is that you've always got the actual insights and they always like, oh, yeah, I suppose the game is like that. And, you know, these new ways of looking at it and like good criticism.
And I'm not really going to be able to do that. But I thought I can at least structure it so that it sounds like I'm doing that. And that if you don't listen to it twice, you can just sort of let it pass and be like, oh, Phil's done like a review intro that time.
So I was trying to do that. But then I also like, you know, a leopard can't change its spots. So like, I did still do a funny voice because that's all I know.
That's the only positive reinforcement that I've had. So it's a mixture of those two things. I think it only really, I think it would have probably only really worked if I'd have gone first and you don't really, you just let it wash over you without really engaging with it.
So this is a, this is a pre-mortem then. Yeah, exactly. You're already, I know that is a great, exactly.
I mean, you always downplay your abilities. You know, like me, you're, you're selling your insights month after month and it's a great effect. So I'm, I'm more confident in this than you are.
Well, well, let's, you know, let's just see. Let's just see. This is my review war.
Something has survived. That was the tagline the lost world Jurassic Park used on its movie posters in 97. But it's just as fitting here in the world of Trespasser.
An island where good ideas lay abandoned. Where the original intention of making a lost world game departed long ago.
A game that tries to implement realistic physics behaviour, but doesn't know how to lay out a level. It ran over budget and sale past deadlines time and again, they spared no expense. And yet here it is, still making it to the shop shelves, long after the movie it was meant as a tie-in for has gone to VHS.
Just like Isla Sorna, it feels like a place the smart science minds long ago departed. Whose incredible potential will never be fulfilled now. But it does at least endure.
Screw Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore. If you want to see something that survived against all the odds, look to Jurassic Park, Trespasser.
That was Billy Connolly doing the review intro for My 90s Game Review.
Very nice. I think that's legit, isn't it? Because it's not Richard Attenborough's accent either.
Yeah, I was actually trying to do... I know it sounds defensive to say this, but I can do a better Scottish accent than that. I'm specifically trying to do Dickie Attenborough's slightly off Scottish accent.
Yeah, I mean, arguably yours is just... The ways in which yours isn't quite his is just the ways in which they're more like an actual Scottish accent. So I don't think you need to feel bad about that.
That was great. That is a great, like... I mean, you say it's obvious, but that analogy, the abandoned dreams of Jurassic Park and the same nature of Trespasser, that is a very strong angle for a review intro.
And I would definitely, if I was actually writing one, I would definitely have used that if I had thought of it. But I didn't and you did.
Particularly if that review was due in the morning and you'd woken up at 6.30 that morning and hadn't started the review yet. That is the angle, isn't it? Listen, vote for Jeremy.
Please vote for Jeremy. Because I don't know what he'll do. Do you know what I mean?
If he doesn't win, he's gone that weird. I don't know what he'll do. I just think it's best for everybody if Jeremy just wins this one.
If he's not channelling that weird energy into this, where does it go and how does that affect the people in his life? It's just safer this way.
It's the safest way. Please vote for Jeremy. Okay, great.
Well, when do you want to do this Ralph Fiennes thing, mate? Oh, it was Ralph Fiennes, isn't it? Do you want to talk about the game or do you want to go straight into it?
Well, let's do it because it relates to this. I've gone this far. I've basically written a sketch and performing all the parts.
And I thought, you know, I don't know, Ralph, but through a friend of a friend, put me in contact just to give me some feedback, you know, just to see how I'm doing, learn from the best because he is the best. So, yeah.
Nice of the friend as well to put you in touch.
Yeah, I know.
He's probably a very busy man and he wouldn't want to because I, my mate Phil once was given the number of a former BBC children's presenter who became a high profile radio DJ and television presenter on a night out in his uni days. And periodically he would just text her asking if she was coming out. And it went quite badly wrong.
She called him up at work and just like, like, listen, stop texting me. This isn't funny. I don't know who's giving you my number.
And so I bring it up because the friend who's put you in touch with the big finds here is walking that same line, isn't he? So, you know, obviously he trusts you.
Yeah, I don't think they're close. I think, you know, I don't want to name the friend, but like they, you know, they have an in in that industry. And I'm as amazed as anyone that Rafe has kind of come through for us here and given me some some feedback.
But like, it's a fantastic and I haven't I haven't listened to this. I saved it for, you know, for us to hear together.
Sure. Well, I mean, I think it speaks, you know, that friend is obviously absolutely confident that whatever your request, it won't be any waste of Rafe's time because, you know, it's such valuable time. And so it's important, important work that you've asked him to do.
So let's listen to that important, vital stuff.
He's full context. Rafe has heard my review or doesn't know anything else.
And that's how he's coming to this. He's just letting us know his thoughts.
Sure.
Well, without further ado, let's hear from Rafe.
Jeremy is talented. He's good. He's very good.
But he's not great. He'll never be great. He desperately wants my prestige, my job, my talent.
He aspires to greatness, but he'll never achieve it. Like me, at his age, Jeremy has forsaken everything to achieve his goals. Like mine, his life is pressure.
There is no way to avoid the mess, the mess you make of your life, of your body, of your sanity, by giving everything you have to pleasing people you will never know. Jeremy, do you like this life, this life that you dreamed about?
Wow. It's fair to say you've caught him at a rather inopportune moment by the sounds of it. He sounds in a bit of a bad mood and I think he's being very...
It's not very constructive, is it? Where am I supposed to take that?
Immediate sort of thoughts?
I just don't know. I don't know how I can build on that really. It feels more like a...
I'm sorry, man.
I don't know. I sort of wish I hadn't asked him. I don't know.
It's a lot. You know when somebody hits a nerve and they hit on something that feels like a truth that you're trying not to think about. That is what we do.
We're seeking the approval of people who don't really know us. What's that about?
It seems a low blow for him to point that out about us though, doesn't it?
I've just started out in this performance slug. I just think he could have been a bit more supportive. But he knows this trade better than anyone.
He knows this is what I need to hear. So I just got to try and take it on the chin, I suppose.
Well, listen, he's got clout in this industry. His review of Boiling Point is still referenced to this day.
And I bought Command and Conquer Tiberian Sun on his recommendation. But all I'd say is just take it with a pinch of salt, mate, because he sounds like you've just, I don't know, maybe your mutual friends caught him in a bad mood because it just seemed a little bit spiking.
Yeah, it sounded to me like he was laying out the cutlery for a kind of dinner. So I think he was probably busy at the time.
Oh, well, it's difficult to do anything after that. Yeah, well, let's talk about the game for a bit, I suppose, and just see if we can get past that awful crushing blow from the major prominent figure who evidently hates, at least one of us.
Thanks.
Never mind that though, let's talk about playing Jurassic Park Trespasser in the year 2023. Had you played it before, Jeremy?
No, no. I mean, it's quite hard to get a hold of now, isn't it? It's not one that's on gog.com or Steam.
There's not really that sort of ground swell of demand for it to be released, so yeah. Even just like getting it in a form that's playable on modern PCs is a little tricky.
Yeah, so I recommended a website called Trescom, which I would also recommend to anybody else who's interested in playing it on modern machines. It's a collection of mods, like official developer updates and user patches and community fixes and things that, I mean, compared to the base version of the game, which is like totally unplayable on modern hardware, it's transformative and you can run it in high resolution. It looks a little bit weird.
It was never intended to run at 4K, but it makes it super playable and like, it doesn't fix the physics or anything like that, but makes it a lot more stable than running the base game. So yeah, if you're interested in playing it at all, then check out Trescom. You can download everything that you need from there.
But okay, so you came into this absolutely blind. How did you get on?
Yeah. I think initially I felt a little nauseated, honestly, just like trying to get to grips with the way your character moves and interacts with the world. So to kind of state the thing that's obvious to people who have played Trespasser, but absolutely would not be if you hadn't come into contact with it.
You're playing first person and not only can you see your body when you look down, but you can always see your right arm, as you say, Phil, it's kind of hyper-extended. Imagine if you stick your own arm in front of you, the way that looks, and if you weren't able to retract it, but it was instead in a sort of permanency Kyle state, and you would just sort of steer it around, you're pressing the mouse button to stop moving your head, and instead start moving your arm, and you can push it and pull it in different directions, and bring it to objects, and then right click on those objects to drag them or pick them up. And so by doing that, you can pick up weapons, you can stow one gun, I think, and then pick up another, but you can also pick up rocks, which you might use to, say, like, knock down a crate from a high perch by chucking it at it, or to drag a crate or some kind of a door or something that's come off its hinges so that you can build a little bridge over some, you know, over a little crevice of some kind.
So that's the kind of territory we're in here, which in theory, I really like that kind of, like, tactility that you get in, you know, in immersive sims and games like Fallout and Dishonored, where every item you can see in the world, pretty much, you can go and pick it up, and maybe you can chuck it and you can improvise with it in some way. And in some ways, Trespasser is that taken to its kind of illogical extreme, where just like putting in the numbers to open a locked door on a keypad, you have to drag your arm around and then prod at the numbers individually and try not to poke the ones next to it, because then you have to start again. And the physics extends to your movement as well.
I don't know if I imagine this, but I'm pretty sure when you go uphill, you are slower than when you're going downhill. Like, it is a lot to get to grips with. And it enables all sorts of stuff, but also at the same time, like, that's not actually how you think about using your arm.
In reality, is it? I think going up to an object in a game and pressing X to pick it up or press a button, that's more what using your arms in real life is like, because, you know, it's an automated process. You don't think about how am I going to steer my arm to carry out this task, unless it's a very sort of particular and unusual task.
So moment to moment, it's quite unlike the sort of real life it's trying to simulate, even though it is technically closer to it. It's this very granular kind of steering your arm around the world. And that is the main interaction in the game.
Everything kind of stems from that. Yeah.
And I mean, shooting is extremely difficult for that reason. And because there isn't any sort of diegetic, there's no HUD. So that means there's no crosshair.
And that means the only way that you can aim a Velociraptor, and they move really quickly towards you, is to use the actual iron sights on the gun if you have it, and just hope for the best. And guns are really, guns are quite rare. Ammo is extremely sparse.
There's never any replacement ammo for guns. So when you empty a clip from a gun, you just have to throw that gun away. And so yeah, combat is incredibly difficult.
And it doesn't really reward any previous FPS muscle memory or expertise because aiming works in a completely different way. And you can't really move. I've never like circle strafed an enemy while I've been shooting.
You have to basically stand stock still because you're pressing three buttons to like extend the arm, move that like aim where the gun is facing and fire. So that's too much to also be like circle strafing or doing like quake jumping to keep your movement speed up.
You're creating another like another point of motion to keep track of and that would just make it impossible. I did end up liking that part of it in the end though. Like it does that survival horror element you talked about that they sort of got nervous about and went back on.
You can still feel that in the combat. The fact that you have a Velociraptor or two kind of making their way towards you and the AI of these dinosaurs is quite unknowable as well, isn't it? Like, okay, is he going to charge me?
I'm not sure. You can get a couple of shots off at them and then sometimes they turn tail and run. Sometimes they might not.
Maybe they'll change their mind while they're doing that and you're like, I don't know what's going to happen here. And you think like you're very conscious of the fact I've got four bullets in this shotgun and the... You get really incredible sort of desperate moments where Velociraptor charges you and knock into your weapon so that you kind of end up firing off to the side and then you're desperately trying to steer like around the bulk of this dinosaur.
Perhaps it'll knock the gun out of your hand and then you're like crouching and literally just grasping to try and pick it up off the floor. And sometimes they'll like thrust too hard in your direction and like they'll spear themselves on the gun. Like a melee weapon of some kind.
And like all those moments are like, it's all incredibly clumsy, but it does have a sort of like truthful desperation to it that sort of captures what you think it would be like to show up on an island and just try your best to like best these creatures which are designed for mauling and for tearing you apart.
Yeah, just totally unlike any other combat in any, certainly any other game that I've played. And yeah, so that does lead to these like these completely unique little anecdotes where like, oh, in the end, you know, a box fell on its head and that was, that was what saved me. Or, you know, I just, I was just braining it with a rock in the end because I, I, you know, fired my shotgun at the ground six times.
You know, I, I still love this game loads. I've got to say, when I first played it, I played it before I read the review. So I wasn't coloured at all by the, the negative reception around the game.
And it was so easy to be oblivious to that in 1998 because unless you'd bought that issue of the games mag that you usually read, that was it. And particularly for a game like Trespasser, there wasn't any playground buzz about it. Nobody was going to be like, oh, they only messed up the physics on that trespasser.
Nobody knew what it was. So in my mind, for a bit of broader context, prior to playing Trespasser, this was my favorite thing to do in 1997. When When the Lost World came out, I saw it in the cinema.
I was absolutely obsessed with it and read the novel as well. I didn't have a computer. All I in terms of gaming, all I had was a Game Boy.
So what I would do is I would just like play being in The Lost World, like in my mind. I would just like play act it. I'm an only child for broader context still.
So I'd just like I'd be around in my bedroom and I'd just use my imagination. I would sort of supplant myself into the plot of the movie so that in addition to Jeff Goldblum going in to rescue his girlfriend, Julianne Moore, his ex, I think, from this island. An 11-year-old boy from York is also there for some reason and we're all surviving together.
So I would just be like coming up with Dialogue on the Fly, like jumping over objects in my house, pretending that I'm on Isla Sauna and that was a sort of great joy to me. And that was how I would spend my free time in 1997. So in 1998 when suddenly I get a computer and that computer will play a disc that installs a playable virtual version of Isla Sauna on it.
I was, Jesus Christ, that was just all I needed and I just didn't have like the awareness. Yeah, I didn't have the awareness that like, oh, this isn't really how it's usually done. And like this shooting is pretty shonky and like where's all the like story and where were all the other characters and why is it so sparse?
I was just like, well, it's Jurassic Park. So yeah, that was my original experience of it. Different to most people's, I would say.
What's what that's meant is every time I've gone back to play it, the power of those original incredible memories is always going to outweigh the nagging mechanical problems that I have with it. And I wouldn't say I was like any better at it than than anybody else. I die all the time.
I find it a really difficult game. The combat is super challenging. The key cards, as you alluded to, Jeremy, feel so precarious because it feels like the sort of game where any object could just fall through the earth at a moment's notice.
You could just nudge it the wrong way. It would go into like an awkward angle. The game engine wouldn't know what to do with it.
And it would just fall, clip through the bottom of the floor. And then it's gone forever. And those key cards just feel like...
You can't protect important items, can you? They're just sort of like out in your hand, extended in front of you. You're trying to navigate doorways and you can't just put them in a bag.
Yeah. So if you're walking around with this important key card, if you'd like knock your elbow on a door, even though you're still holding the button to hold the key card, it can be knocked out of your hand and you won't necessarily realize that it has been knocked, unless you bring up your hand and hold down control to use the, like to pivot your wrist to bring the key card up to your vision. You don't know whether you're still holding it or not necessarily.
So then you might have lost it anywhere along this, like quite large area of ground that it's really difficult to find again.
Yeah. It's like if you were told, right, you're going on holiday, but you have to carry your passport through the airport out in front of you while you are through baggage and security and all these busy areas. And like, imagine all the times that that would be knocked from your hand and you were desperately scrabbling around to find it again.
And these key cards even finding them in the first place is, is sometimes they're just like out in John Hammond's garden. Why did he leave his white key card there? Even in like, in leaving the island in a hurry, this doesn't make environmental sense to me.
That's where I got stuck. I didn't finish this game first time and not for years later. I got stuck in Hammond's, Hammond's compound, like his mansion, because it's a series of finding these in-gen key cards and unlocking the next bit until eventually you get the key cards that well, I think you have to power up a generator that unlocks the gate that allows you out of the mansion complex and through into the next area and I, I just, I just couldn't find one of the key cards and then like, that was it, you know, I don't, there was probably like some sort of written walkthrough, but trying to locate the key card based on, you know, just somebody's written text walkthrough, who's not, you know, a professional guide writer and has just made this thing out of the goodness of their own heart.
It was impossible. So I didn't finish the time and it's only probably only with the advent of YouTube that I ever did manage to get past that bit and find where the other key cards were. With all of that said, I do think it's kind of a fantastic adventure because it really seems to commit to the idea of desolation and being a complete fish out of water in this.
Not only are you stranded on an island without any provisions, but obviously, there are dinosaurs and I've never felt such a keen sense of that in any other game. So many games make you feel like a fish out of water and that you're an interloper in a hostile environment, but I've never felt more vulnerable and more perpetually out of my depth and just scrabbling by than in Trespasser. Then you do get these brilliant moments of reward where it's another little memoir from John Hammond and then you see something recognizable from the movie, which again for me was an incredible thrill.
To see the doors of the InGen research labs, or helipads that you see momentarily in the movie. That's all the reward that I needed to keep going and do horrible box puzzles over broken bits of monorail track for the next hour. That was fine.
Or every now and again, there's a T-Rex.
It does really make you feel... There's something about the awareness of your body that makes you feel that vulnerability, isn't there? Which is something that the original System Shot has a little of as well.
You can feel your body in that game when you clamber over something. You can feel that you're not just a camera on a stick or on wheels, as you are in first person games today. There is something going on under the hook there and you're just very conscious of how brittle you are.
The ending is unnecessarily difficult, I think. Even at like... Probably the second time I played through this would have been like the mid 2000s and I'd made it past all the key cards and stuff, but then in order to escape the island, you go along this trail tracking down the remnants of InGen because fairly logically, you see that there were buildings and you're like, well, there have been humans here, maybe those humans have got a phone.
So you're following their trail and powering on what's left of the infrastructure of the island until you can call for help via a radio and get a helicopter to rescue you. But in order to get to the helipad, you need to go through one of the most difficult sections in all of gaming where you're ascending this, like, not quite a volcano. I guess the lava would have been too hard to rent, but like a big, big mountain, a big hollow mountain full of raptors.
And, you know, bear in mind all the problems that exist with the combat is even like the first like raptor encounter and it's just you and a big open area and three guns and one raptor. You make it by, you know, through the skin of your teeth. By this stage in the game, there's two or three raptors every minute.
You know, you barely make it like 50 paces up this mountain before there's another raptor encounter and so it's just supremely demanding. You need to absolutely master this really broken and unpredictable physics system in order to ascend all the way, get to the helipad and make it out. And I think if I ever come close to disliking the game, it's in that final stretch where I'm just constantly reloading, having the same fight against raptors and ultimately leaving it to luck.
Like one raptor will get in the way of another or its tail will sort of swish at it and that will knock it off balance. The flip side of that coin is that actually like the physics and animation relating to the dinosaurs themselves is really good and like when you actually make contact with a dinosaur, either when you like, you can just sort of like uselessly slap it with your hand if you want, it's never going to kill it that way. But like when you slap it, it makes this incredibly, this brilliant bit of foley that just sounds like, oh, that's, that's what a dinosaur's flesh would sound like if I slapped it half-heartedly with my hand.
And when you hit it with a rock, you get a different noise. And when you hit it with a shotgun, you get this incredible bit of feedback as well. And you knock the, it doesn't happen so much with pistols, but with bigger, higher caliber weapons like a shotgun, you knock it off balance and you see it like struggle for balance, a bit like those like dog robots, right?
You know, when you push them over, they try to regain their balance, but then they can't and they fall over. And when they die, they almost like loaf like a cat. It's just sort of flopped down on the floor, like a sort of defeated snake raptor hybrid thing.
And that's incredibly satisfying. And then you can also like push them off the edges of cliffs and mountains and things, which is loads of fun. So I suppose what I'm saying is that even though that bit is broken and obviously just intended to artificially extend the playtime of the game, it is quite fun to shoot the dinosaurs in the end.
In what other game can you slap the torso of a velociraptor? I can put so much of my own flesh inside this thing. Incredible.
Yeah, it's like, it is really quite something, that skeletal animation thing they've got going on. Sometimes you shoot them, and I think sometimes you can break bones, like you'll see them kind of limp in a very sort of simulated fashion. And yeah, they're in constant motion, and like the momentum of their last movement.
And sometimes when you kill them, you don't realize for a couple of seconds, because they're still, you know, they still have the momentum of their last movement. It's carrying them forward, and you're like, oh my God, no, it's gone, it's gone. And yeah, just the interplay between that simulation and the AI and it being as unusual as it is, like, it's just not like, it's not straightforwardly hostile.
Like, they're always dangerous, but you're trying to work out, like, can I just kind of circumvent this one and save some ammo? Have I seen this one off already? Like, there's this kind of constant calculation going on, which is, like, does stand up.
But yeah, as you say, that, like, that final ascent is, is brutal. Although in some ways, like, it makes more sense than some of the areas earlier in the game, like, because it's, it's more linear and straightforward, you're just following this one path up the hillside. The physics puzzles you come across, they're in your way, so it makes sense to do them.
Whereas in other parts of the game, like, you've got this fairly open environments, and the designers don't have anything to fill them with. It's like, there's clearly a critical path through every area, and besides that, it's just sort of like open space, and it does feel like incomplete in level design terms. It's quite an odd experience in that way.
I think that's the weakest aspect of it, and I'm saying this to somebody who genuinely does like the game. Level design is where it really feels lacking, because I'll put up with the arm all day long, I really will, for that sense of place, and to me, it really does have a sense of place, but I think what I was even a bit disappointed with at the time is that, I don't know, it feels like the other half of the island is where all the good stuff is. It feels like your critical path is somehow the bit that they forgot about, and they built all the cool stuff on the other side.
It's difficult to articulate, but I suppose because they haven't quite committed to it being like a Romero-style roller coaster ride of experiences every five seconds on the critical path, it's not quite that linear, but it's also not Far Cry, so it's effectively a really wide corridor shooter.
Yeah, because in Far Cry, the first Far Cry which came out a few years later also isn't an open world, it is wide outdoor corridors, but you can tell yourself you're taking a different approach by, you know, oh, I'm going to head down towards the beach here and use the water, or I'm going to head through this brush up here, like you're taking different approaches to these difficult challenges, whereas in Trespasser, you're just choosing to walk in a different bit, like it doesn't, you're either choosing to walk through the critical path and do the physics puzzles and stuff, or you're choosing to just miss them and not really have any experience.
Far Cry also shows you, like Far Cry, every time you get to a new area, it will show you a thing. You will be probably high up in the grass. It will show you a thing down on the beach.
It's either like a bunch of enemies or a gun emplacement or somewhere where you need to get to. But then there's like, the boundaries are so wide that you have, as you say, like, at least the illusion of choice, like all roads eventually lead down to Rome to this objective that you need to hit. But like, you can snipe them from up on the hill or you can try and sneak up close to them and then stealth them.
Or maybe there's a third way round. Maybe you can avoid them entirely. Here, it doesn't show you that there's a thing.
You're not moving from like sequence to sequence or objective to objective. You're just moving along. And it, yeah, I think that's why it has that walking sim quality to it because you all you ever really have is just the vague sense of like, I'm being channeled in this direction.
It's not like I'm being channeled towards this next thing that I need to do. And I think, yeah, with some more experienced level designers on the team, I think they would have used the, you know, the topography of the island a bit more to at least make it seem a bit more exciting to telegraph where you're going. And the idea that there's something meaningful about to happen when you arrive there.
And that doesn't happen very much.
Yeah. You think of a contrast of Half-Life, which came out like a month later and the way, obviously has very different goals, didn't try to build open environments, but like it has that sense of constant flow. You always know what direction you need to be heading in and you're always compelled to do it.
Like it presents problems to you and you figure out how to solve them. Whereas Trespasser, yeah, it just feels like we've made a sort of thin thread of things throughout this environment that you follow along, but we've also just got all this open space and the problems with that are compounded by the fact that moving is not very fun. Like it feels too simulated in just the walking around aspect.
And when you get it wrong, like when you realize, oh, I actually needed a key card that's in a building on the other side of this compound, that's a miserable realization because you're just looking back across that space and it takes forever. I'd put a podcast on, which I never do with games, but I was like, well, this is, I just need somebody to get me through this walk. Yeah.
Yeah. I'll tell you what it feels like to move around and to interact with stuff in this game feels like, you know, have you ever heard people sort of describe the, like the movement in the armor games has been like a dishwasher with, or like a washing machine carrying a rifle? Do you know what I mean?
You're like, the camera movement is so awkward and like lumbering. And like the way that the your arms like pop into view and at weird angles. I think this is the originator of that.
So like, you know, the lineage goes back from from armor three through the armor series down to the first Operation Flashpoint, which had some of the most janky walking and running I've ever experienced. But Trespasser is like the the OG. Yeah, yeah, it's pretty.
I wonder if even just a sprint button might have, you know, if you could move at quake speed, that might have helped quite a bit.
I have so much love for that simulation approach and so much of the thinking that's gone into Trespasser. But you have to know when at what moments to abandon that, right? You just need people to move at 30 miles an hour in a first person game.
Like, yeah, if that's if your if your challenges are, you know, incredibly spaced out in the way they are in Trespasser, then that's just what you need. Although like it does work when when it comes to the combat, the fact that you can't move that quickly and you're sort of navigating these fast moving dinosaurs that adds to the fear and the drama of that. But everything in between is just made a bit of a struggle because of that.
So that's our thoughts on Trespasser. Maybe that's inspired you to play it for the first time or replay it if you're already a veteran of it. I'd be really interested to hear what the consensus is among the listenership on this game.
And if anybody is thinking of going back for a replay, then please do let us know your experiences with it. Yeah, I think it'd be fascinating to hear about that. So I think it's time for 90s Games Court.
And as we said earlier in the episode, I think this is going to be one of the more hotly debated bits of courtroom drama, because I don't think you like it very much, Jeremy. So are you feeling like defense or prosecution on this one?
I've got to go prosecution, I think. I think with an understanding that it was ahead of its time and it has some wonderful ideas in there. I don't even think you can claim that it was influential, necessarily, because I don't think, I think other developers looked at this game and said, oh, we don't want to be that.
But ideas that it did attempt, other developers came to later independently and proved that they were good ideas, that they were good concepts to chase. But, for instance, Half-Life 2 had the gravity gun. It had a tool that made sense of interacting with this physics environment.
It made it fun. It made it accessible. As with everything in this game, Trespasser got halfway there and in many ways, did a lot of the hardest work to get to that point, but it didn't get close enough to make it consistently fun.
Fun is less than 50 percent of the experience of Trespasser, I would say. I've got to condemn them on that basis.
I'll certainly meet you halfway there, that fun is at a premium in Trespasser. It doesn't come into the equation very often. For me, it's an atmosphere piece and I seem to talk about atmosphere so often when I'm trying to justify why I like games.
That's probably the chief reason why I feel inclined to defend it. You've already mentioned that it's influential to a degree. That's not really why I want to try to get it acquitted.
I'm trying to think of other releases from around this time, like games like Wargasm, which again came out around this time about Christmas 98, which is utterly forgotten about. It's a vehicular war sim but with quite arcade-y feel to it. Mechanically, it works pretty well.
It's quite satisfying to be in a tank and fire at other tanks. There might have been mechs, there might even have been fighter jets and things like that. But there were like seven games like that that month, and Wargasm probably sticks in my mind because it had that name.
Trespasser wasn't that. Everything was broken in it and it didn't feel very enjoyable to do anything in it. But there's such depth to the world that you inhabit, even not from a level design perspective either, but I guess the meaning of it, why you're there and it really captured something of the enigma of Isla Sauna from the movie.
And it definitely benefited from the fact that there is, this is going to be absolute junk if Jurassic Park wasn't the thing, and there hadn't been a lost world movie, and it was just a game about somebody that crash lands on an island and there are dinosaurs there. I wouldn't have any of this sense of place or atmosphere or meaning. But because Jurassic Park was a huge cultural phenomenon in the 90s, and these visionary developers and veterans from animation and movies had pulled all these ideas into it and harnessed what they thought was so interesting about Isla Sorna.
I've just got to die on that hill, often literally.
Yeah, die on the mountain covered in velociraptors.
Exactly. I can only put it in woolly terms as always. It's about atmosphere and it's about immersion.
I never felt like I was on the battlefield in Wargasm. It was really like I visited Isla Sorna in Trespasser. I'd always favor that sort of experience and deal with a control system where you have separate, you hold down control to pivot the wrist and shift to pivot at the elbow and all this useless shit that doesn't really work than a game whose every mechanic is super polished.
I'm familiar with it from the genre. I've played it before. I've honed it and perfected it and I feel really competent as I'm moving through the game.
But the setting is the same setting that I've been playing seven times that month already. So there's something in there, right?
Yeah.
I mean, having played Trespasser.
That forms my defense. Yeah. I'm not going to forget this game, having played it.
Like there's absolutely no way I could. And it is like a fascinating artifact. When you look at System Shock and that was, you know, almost as experimental and ambitious and it worked out and inspired so many different games.
And Trespasser was just taking that same approach a little further. And it didn't come together. It didn't work out.
But I agree with you. I'd rather we had more trespassers. And I don't think we get very many of them.
Or maybe we do and they're buried on Steam, you know, in places where we never see them. Certainly we don't get, you know, Steven Spielberg backed projects like this anymore.
I think the game that I've played recently that reminds me most of a sort of a modern day Trespasser is Teardown, you know, the destructible environment game. And actually, to be fair, like I think it's in full release now. I was playing some of the earlier access builds where the physics were not perfected.
But like, I just loved being in a world where like I could get into a truck and I could drive that truck through a wall. And that's all I need. It doesn't matter if it feels a bit broken, which it did at the time.
I can't speak for the full release. Like I just I'm glad that that game exists. It's super ambitious.
And like, it can because of the like the density of the particles and how many tiny particles things fall into, like it's never going to feel completely realistic. But fundamentally, it's just like a fascinating playground to spend time in. And I'd rather it existed in broken form.
Not that Tehran was broken. That didn't exist at all.
Yeah, I'm glad that this curious object exists and is a constant source of fascination to us. But I think it's best that it exists in a jail cell.
Judge Jeremy spoken. I couldn't get that one acquitted. I don't feel like I articulated.
The problem is with this, this is why again, I'm surprised that I get work in in games is that my frames of reference and my like hierarchy of importance in games is so off and so weird. I can only put it in terms of like atmosphere. Well, I don't really know what that even means.
That it's very difficult for me to review a modern game because like, you know, I'm looking at it from such a strange angle. But yeah, I think that's probably fair. And I would imagine that most listeners would agree that this probably does deserve to to go to games jail.
I'm really sorry Trespasser. I tried. That'll do it for this episode.
We hope you enjoyed it. And Jeremy, I hope that by now you've the wounds have started to heal after that vicious attack from Hollywood A-lister rare finds.
Yeah, I was able to put it out of my mind for a little while. It'll be in the wee hours of the night that I think on it most, I imagine.
Always the way. Yeah, get in touch with us on on the Discord. Let us know what you thought about this episode and keep an eye out for any further announcements.
Yeah, vote for the winner of this month's review was there'll be a poll on Twitter. Samuel will put that up once the episode's live.
He will indeed. And you can follow Jeremy at Jeremy Peel at twitter.com.
And you can follow me at Jeremy Peel and you can follow Phil home if you see him in the street, because that's the only way that you can possibly communicate with him. You won't find him on the internet.
No, I have popped in the discord once or twice. I might have said something once. I always, I think I left a little picture of my old beige PC playing Blade Runner and I had a cup of tea.
Maybe. Yeah, we can quickly disprove that with the search function if it's not true.
We'll find out. It's not a deliberate thing. I really like, I do read through the discord and I love that there's like, you know, you put this thing out and then people actually like, oh God, they've listened to it.
And they like it. Although they've said something about it. It's amazing.
So I'm not trying to, you know, it's not that I think I'm above it. That's not why I'm not chatting in there.
It's just how you live.
It's just how I live. I'm extremely offline. So no offence intended.
But it's enjoyed in the discord as well. I think they like to imagine your, your deeply offline life. It's a source of fun.
I recommend it. I really do recommend it to anybody. Thank you very much for listening.
We will catch you in the next episode, which is the series finale. It's Quake vs. Half-Life.
It should be a good one. Definitely don't miss that one. We'll see you next time.
Bye bye.
