Hello and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, but I'm not joined by Matthew Castle because he didn't want to do the PSP draft. So I'm joined by an old friend and colleague, Darran Jones, editor of Retro Gamer.
Darran, how's it going?
It's going very well, Samuel. Thank you very much for having me on the show. I'm a big fan, even though I'm quite a few episodes behind everyone else.
So yeah, this is a real treat. Thank you.
Oh yeah, of course. Are you listening to them in order? Are you up to 2021 or something?
Is that how you've been enjoying the podcast?
So I'm kind of like really, really far behind, but you're not going to like this. But basically I've been listening to my favorite ones out of order. So I do the drafts and I do games court because I think it's fucking amazing.
Well, that's very flattering. I don't mind people skipping, you know, there's a lot of like crap ones in there, old mail bags, what we've been playing episodes that you can skip. I think that a lot of people go back and listen to the drafts or the best games of the different year episodes, so I take no offense to that whatsoever.
I am listening to them all in order. I'm just saying that what I'll do is, because obviously there's so much to listen to, I'll tend to go ahead to the ones that I like. So for example, I found the Yakuza talk really fascinating.
I loved the God of War one. Didn't really agree with what you were saying about The Last of Us and stuff, but you know, it would be boring if we all had the same opinions. So yeah, I'm kind of cherry-picking, but I am going through them in order.
I'm just very, very far behind.
Well, I'm very flattered because you like NGamers Court in particular, you have an encyclopedic knowledge of video games, you know, like going back generations. So you know way more about this subject than either myself or Matthew. So, you know, the fact that you were enjoying it on that level is exciting to me.
I'm pleased to hear that and flattered to hear that. But yeah, it's great to have you on the podcast, Darran. I want to have you on, you know, for a long time.
Delightful to have you on. I know that the listeners will be excited to have you on too. So I did want to ask you as someone I've known for, I think, so I joined Imagine in early 2007.
So 14, wait 17 years, which is a ridiculous amount of time. And yeah, I have fond memories of working with you. You were a great presence in the office and you've been editor of Retro Gamer the entire time I've known you.
So the magazine has gone from strength to strength. How's it treating you these days?
It's treating us pretty well, Samuel. I mean, we've just had our 20th anniversary as you've obviously seen on Twitter. And you know, that's obviously a big deal for any magazine, let alone one as niche as Retro Gamer.
So yeah, we've got a huge passionate reader base. We've got a lot of very talented freelancers. You've got a great team with like Andy Salter, who used to be on Games DM, is obviously now the designer and Nick Thorpe is our features editor and he largely puts together amazing cover features, every issue.
So yeah, it's very fulfilling to have been on a magazine for so long and also rather sad to see how many of your companion mags have fallen by the wayside in that period of time.
I mean, every single one of them basically, they're all gone from play to game's TM. They no longer exist, which is sad. But I think that probably speaks to the fact that retro gaming has grown as a passion for people over time, more people are interested in it now.
And I suppose like, what do you attribute the magazine's longevity to? Is it that sort of growing fascination with retro games as retro gaming interests has hit like PS1, PS2 kind of era where games become mega, mega massive?
I think so. I mean, you're always gonna have nostalgia, which is driving interest in retro. But if you look at like publishers as well, publishers have obviously started to cotton on to how much money can be exploited from the retro market.
So you've had things like the NES Mini, you've had obviously the PlayStation Classic. There's a lot of classic games that could be re-released on compilations. It seems that there's far more compilations around now than there was during even the PS2 era.
So because obviously everybody is kind of accessing their back catalogs, some companies better than others, it just reminds people that this stuff is available. But yeah, I mean, I think one of the biggest strengths of RG is that we've always been able to get a solid amount of freelancers who do great work and get great interviews. And our content is timeless because everything we're talking about is already really sodden old.
So you don't have to worry about competing with the internet, which is one of the biggest problems modern mags still have.
Yeah, that's a good point actually, because there's no one destination you go for that stuff, right? There's a lot of retro YouTubers. I know that's really emerged as a big thing in the last few years, but yeah, in terms of actually reading about retro games, it's not really, there aren't that many places really.
So yeah, I'm pleased that Retro Gamer has remained this consistent home for that stuff. And I totally agree on publishers getting better at putting their stuff out there. Like it's never been easier.
If you want to play like old Metal Slug games or Capcom games that are largely forgotten about, it's easier to get hold of that stuff than it's ever been. So yeah, I agree that's a huge part of it. So yeah, but obviously the mag is excellent as well, Darran.
That's a huge part of its success. So you've been on the mag for a long time. Can you talk about how you ended up working on Retro Gamer?
Cause I remember you telling me you had a civilian job before that. And I think you'd paid off your mortgage and you were like, right time to do a silly job. That's how I remember you explaining your career to me.
But is that accurate or am I misremembering?
It's slightly different, so I basically after school, so I left school when I was 15 because that's what you did back in the 80s. And I didn't go to university or anything. I just went straight to a job.
And part of the reason that I didn't go to university or college was that the places that I was able to go to were too far away and I was scared to leave home. So I basically thought, well, if I carry on doing the job I'm doing now full-time rather than part-time, I'll have loads of money. And I had this very short term idea of what was important.
So I was basically working full-time at Gateway, which is a supermarket chain that no longer exists. I then did a power move to Tesco, where I realized that, hey, this place is massive. And if I got a job here, I wouldn't have to do anywhere near as much work because there's 16 people behind the counter, as opposed to three at Gateway.
So I moved there. And then I did a few bits of management training there and that was okay. But again, I didn't like the moving around.
I don't like a lot of disruption. So I eventually found myself working at Liverpool Victoria, which is a car insurance place. And while I was there, I started honing my writing because I'd always done a lot of writing because I used to play lots of Dungeons and Dragons.
And basically that gave me, because I was a dungeon master, you're always writing scenarios and adapting existing scenarios. So I quite enjoyed writing. And then I started doing a lot of writing at Liverpool, Victoria, because they had like their own private place where they had a magazine that they released all the time.
And I then went on to various websites to find work. And I found a great little place called GameStar, which is still around today. And they took a chance on me.
And that led to me applying for several jobs at Highbury, none of which I got. So I redid my CV and a job came up for XBM because I loved the Xbox. And I really wanted to get on to XBM.
And because at the time I was making good headway with PRs at various companies because I would get all the discs that would be sent out to preview for GameStar. And I had like, I've been speaking to Rockstar, Electronic Arts, lots of companies that typically wouldn't give small websites disc coverage. They decided that they wanted me to go on to GameStm.
So I ended up on GameStm as news editor, massively out of my depth because I just wasn't good. I wasn't good at writing to Target and writing to Spec and the sheer pace of magazines. I always remember the first day I was there, I was given a game to review.
I think it was Lost Kingdoms and they were like, yeah, you'll need this finished by like three o'clock. And I was like, well, it's an RPG. So I'm not sure if I'll get it finished.
Oh, no, no, no, we mean you'll need the review finished by three o'clock. I was like, all right, so that's what games journalism is like. And then after that, I quickly moved on to the retro section because I guess that's where my true passion was.
When the late Keith Edwards left, I was asked to take over, which I think was around issue 18 because at the time I was getting quite disillusioned and I wanted to go on to DVD next because I love films as much as games probably.
What snapshot of the past that is, a magazine DVD next?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used to love DVD next. And so they offered me the editor of Retro Gamer.
And then when Imagine was a thing, I got Headhunter to basically be the editor of Retro Gamer, which was from issue 19. And we're now on issue 250, no, 261. So I've been there ever since.
That's amazing. That's amazing. Such a ridiculously long time.
Were you particularly passionate about Retro Gamer when you moved on to Retro Gamer? Or was it something you had to accumulate over time?
Oh, no, I've always... So I was the kind of sad sack who was trying to get all his mates to play Double Dragon on an emulator in 1996 when, like, Tomb Raider and Super Mario 64 are out. So I've always enjoyed living in the past.
And as I'm getting older, I'm enjoying it even more because the present is just so depressing.
Funny thing is, Darran, to me you're always... you're always sort of frozen in amber, like, in my mind. You've always been about somewhere between, like, 38 and 42.
And, like, just nowhere... Like, I just can't really picture you at any other point in time. But then I realised...
I think you posted a picture... I think recently you posted about how maybe one of your daughters is a DJ now. And I remember, though, meeting your daughters at, like, one of the Imagine Summer parties.
And it was extremely... They were extremely tiny people. And now the idea that they're, like, adults doing stuff or...
That just really maybe underlined the passage of time to me and freaked me out slightly. So, yeah. Amazing you've been on there for such a long time, though.
I'm really curious to know how you think the magazines evolved over that time. Because I remember when I was working with you at Imagine, you had a lot of anxiety about the idea that you couldn't really repeat covers. This is kind of like a bit of an editorial edict, maybe, but you couldn't tell the same story over and over again, and you had to find new things to talk about.
But there's also this tension with the readers where a certain generation of them doesn't want to hear that PS2 is retro or whatever. So I was curious about that journey creatively with the magazine.
Yeah, it is a fine line to walk, and it's also one that you gain with experience in so much that when I first started in magazines, particularly on Games TM, I was very, very defensive all the time of anything that was ever said about the magazine. This was Games TM and early Retro Gamer. You take everything to heart, and one of the things that you probably know yourself is that ultimately, if you're going to offer criticism on anything, you have to expect criticism to come back on you, and you just have to develop a thick skin.
It took me a while to gain my hardened tortoise-like shell, which I now have. Yeah, it was difficult. Yes, one of the really fascinating things about Retro is that while everybody largely comes to terms with the fact that Retro games are the games I used to enjoy when I was a kid, people don't necessarily seem to realize that people are different ages.
So they played newer games when they were kids, which are Retro to them. And so you kind of... Not tune it out, but you kind of have to be strong enough to set your tenet of this is what we feel is Retro, and you stick to it.
And we kind of go with a 15-year cutoff point. It used to be ten, but the lengthy success of the 360 and the PS3 kind of changed that. And the reason we've always gone for kind of like the 15 years is that even if you can't decide on time, typically most people will accept that a system which is like two generations old is going to be considered old.
So that's kind of how we get around it. But even today, we still have people saying like there's anything beyond 16-bit I'm not interested in. And it's like, well, that's fine.
And luckily, the market has changed so that you have got a few other magazines like Pixel Addict, which is more catering to home computers. And you've got Crashers come back, Zap64 have come back, so they kind of take care of the homebrew. So we can just do our thing.
And it is hard that the length of time is expanding. So, you know, 10, 15 years ago, we only had to worry about the really old systems. But now we're covering around 40 years of potential content.
So the wider it gets. But on the other hand, because the magazine obviously is still going along, we're kind of like an amoeba, which is absorbing all the new stuff. So it could easily get to a point where I'll often go through old issues of Games TM, see a preview they've done with interview content.
It's like, right, that's going in the magazine as a making of, because that stuff is now old and it's something that you can talk about. So we're very lucky in that respect in that theoretically a magazine like Retro Gamer could just trundle on forever because it's just only going to get bigger as it, as it absorbs all these new consoles and can then spit it all out.
I think the key thing is as well, whenever you pick up a copy of Retro Gamer, the eras represented are always incredibly varied and that seems by design. So you'll never have an issue that's just like Halo 3, Assassin's Creed 2, you know, kind of thing. It's always like you might see one more feature on one more recent game, but then you'll go further back and you always kind of run the gamut.
Is that by design as well to make sure each issue has a variety of eras represented?
Oh, yeah, that's absolutely intentional. I mean, one of the things that I do try and do with it is if you do flick through the mag, you will literally... every issue is a timeline.
So we start off with the 8-bit stuff and you'll gradually... It's very, very rare that you'll get to like page 90 and then you'll see, aside from our in the chairs that we always stick at the back, it's very rare that you'll see like a Spectrum game at the end of the magazine. We have this nice structure.
And one of the things that we've often been asked about is, you know, why don't you actually divide the magazine into sections? And while that's an okay idea, all it's really going to do to a reader is highlight the sections of the mag you're not interested in. So if you were suddenly at a point where you're like, hang on a minute, I love like this spectrum, but there's only 10 pages of 8-bit coverage in this 116-page mag.
Why am I buying it? So yeah, we've always stayed away from making it that obvious, but I do kind of see each magazine as like a capsule where you're just travelling through the retro gaming timeline.
I was curious when it comes to covering more recent games and you get to games from major publishers that are still around. I wonder if you maybe sometimes encounter the kind of like the same sort of barriers on getting access. You know, I'm kind of familiar with this from both sides of the fence, but I was curious if that affected you.
If you wanted to do something on Assassin's Creed 2, for example, how much harder is it to get the access versus a Spectrum game from decades ago?
So generally, I tend to bypass a lot of PRs in so much that with a game like Assassin's Creed 2, there's going to be enough people who have left the company that you can probably get an interview with. And we do obviously work with PRs, and as you know, some PRs are a lot more helpful than others. But the thing, the most important thing that I've learned is that if you do want to work with a PR, it's always best to basically talk about something which is near a release of something they've got coming out.
So you'll often see that when we have certain covers, they'll typically coincide with the release of a big game, like a big Zelda game or something like that. And because it just gives you, you know what it's like, you need ammunition and you need to make your magazine seem desirable. And in all honesty as well, lots of PRs still don't necessarily link what we can do in Retro Gamer to their new product.
So sometimes you'll just explain and say, well, you know, if you allow us to talk about this, we can do like a page or two pages on your new game because they are tied together by like a 20 year history. And they're like, oh, yeah, okay, then that sounds really cool. So you just have to take the opportunities where you find them.
But I have found that it's like all these PRs are in big fortresses and it is getting tougher to get over the battlements and get what you need. But, you know, there's loads of PRs out there. Companies like Sega, Capcom, Nintendo, they're all massively helpful and they'll always try and do stuff.
But the other fact of the matter is that when you look at how the industry is now, there just isn't necessarily the people you need to speak to at those places anyway. So you often have to go down the LinkedIn route or the Facebook route, Twitter, and from there.
Yeah, that makes sense. I remember when one of the last issues of Games TM I worked on before I left Imagine was I remember at the same time we both did Wind Waker HD covers and we both got lovely foil covers. Yours was blue, if I recall, and mine was gold.
I think we both got A&M Re-Access off the back of that. And it felt like a real win. So I'm pleased that sort of thing is still possible.
You know, I'm glad.
And I think that came about because obviously we were working together. And it's that whole thing of if you pull your resources and you can go to a publisher and say, well, look, if you can get us access to these people, we'll be able to put the mag in like, we'll be able to put the news in like four or five mags. That becomes a lot more enticing a proposal.
Yeah, absolutely. That makes sense. I was curious, Darran, what were your memories of working with me?
What do you remember about me in the office? I was very irritating, if I recall. What do you remember about me?
I remember you being very, very sure of yourself, very confident, not in a cocky way. I don't know if you can remember this, but the first couple of weeks when you were there, I often used to take you to places like Game Station and show you where all the good game shops and stuff were. I remember you being...
You knew what you wanted to do, and you were good at it. I think it's testament to that, that if you look at how much stuff you've done in the short time you've been in the industry, that's pretty amazing. But yeah, very, very confident and not afraid to learn.
I can always remember you saying that you've never seen the Star Wars films and stuff, but then when you obviously moved on to sci-fi now, it's just like you would consume everything you needed. You were like, I'm Johnny Five from Short Circuit where you just somehow acquired all this information and you could always talk with authority on a subject, even if you might have only seen the film or the game in question a few weeks before. And that's quite an impressive thing, I think.
I mean, I will just correct you and say Star Trek, not Star Wars. Star Wars I did see before I joined.
Fair enough. I always remember thinking, what? And it's like, oh, yeah, well, yeah, another whipper snapper.
No, honestly, I didn't know that much about film when they moved me on to Cypher now. That's why it wasn't ideal. The thing is that the expertise you've got with a lot of games, sort of like Generations, I've only really got with PS2 Generation onwards, and that very much felt like my strength.
So I remember when I was moved on to Cypher now, I was a bit like, why are you doing this when this is the one thing I clearly know loads about? But yeah, it's funny to hear your perspective of that. But yeah, Retro Gamer is the last mag standing from the old Bournemouth Imagine office, at least on the game side.
Do you miss being around all those different mag teams, or is it nicer to have a quieter life without loads of boys in their 20s yelling all the time?
I kind of conflicted on it, because the early days of Imagine was excellent, in so much that, because of obviously the way the company was run, everybody kind of like pulled together, and everybody was in the same boat, and even though I didn't necessarily go on the same kind of trips and stuff as the other mags, it was always great hearing about the anecdotes, and seeing that there was just a huge amount of creativity, and it's rather sad that all that's gone, because I work from home now. I've been working from home for the last four years since COVID. Yeah, I do miss the interactivity, and this is going to sound really cheesy, but I'm going to say it anyway, having all the youngsters around just made me feel.
Young, if that makes sense, because at this point, I had a mortgage, I'd been married since 1998, so I was pretty much like a dinosaur, I still am, and I got into games very late. I was 30 when I first started on Games DM, and by that point, everybody my age was already an editor or higher. So I kind of did this all back to front.
Most people start when they're very young, or leave in uni and go from there. So I was always quite envious of all the shenanigans you lot used to get up to.
It was very, very boy-heavy environment. I mean, not the office generally. There was quite a broad mix of editorial teams there, because you had basically photography and creative arts magazines that were staffed entirely by women, and then games magazines staffed almost entirely by men, and they were just next to each other.
I've not really been in an editorial environment like that, because when it got to the future, all the games mags were together. There were a few more women in the teams, but it was otherwise still mostly a kind of a blokey environment. But yeah, I missed that too.
There was a lot of great talent. I felt like Imagine was great when I got there. And then over time, I had the thing where people leave, and then it doesn't quite feel like the same environment anymore.
And then a couple of the mags closed, and the mag sales got a bit harder after the recession in 07, 08, 09. So it just became a bit more tricky. But it's funny, because at the time, I remember thinking, well, obviously the pay was not good at Imagine.
But I do remember thinking that it was like, I think at the time, I thought this is quite a strict atmosphere and workplace and stuff. And now I've actually worked at other places. That was not true at all.
Imagine was actually really relaxed, and people could bollock on, behave however they wanted in the offices, basically. It was very sort of like loose, casual environment. And I think that was mostly a good thing.
So yeah, I miss it too. But I will say, Darran, for somebody who's been around for so long, you are so switched on. You sound incredibly switched on.
I was curious, what's coming up in the next couple of Retro Gamer issues, Darran? Anything you want to point people towards before we get started on the subject of today's podcast?
Yeah, so the issue which is literally due out next Thursday has got Nintendo innovations. So we're doing all the cool Nintendo innovations from a hardware perspective that they've done over the many years. Even some of the ones which weren't as successful like The Virtual Boy.
And that also comes with a nice 32-page book about the Metroid series because we've just done a Super Metroid cover. So that should be quite cool. And then we're currently working on our next issue and the cover for that is going to be Metal Gear Solid.
Because amazingly, despite being around for 20 years, we have never done a Metal Gear Solid cover.
Were you able to get Kojima? Did you try and get him?
Do you know something? I've kind of given up. I mean, I have quite a difficult thing with that because we did get Kojima once for an interview and I sent all of my questions off and I was so proud.
And then the latest issue of Official PlayStation Magazine came out and they had all of my questions and answers in it.
Oh, right. Oh, controversial. And I remember because you know me, Sam, and I'm not the most tactful of people.
And I remember giving the editor, I can't remember who the poor guy was, but I told him exactly what I thought of him stealing my content. And he knew nothing about it. And apparently there had been a mix up in Japan and they thought that the answers were supposed to be for Official PlayStation.
So we got ours back and we had a really good interview, but it was somehow diminished a little bit by the fact that it had already been printed in another magazine. And you know, there's not really much crossover between Official PlayStation Mag and Retro Gamer, but it still felt like such a huge get. And then to see it appear elsewhere was a bit upsetting.
So I have tried contacting them several times since, but to no avail. But one of the things that you probably know yourself from the mag and the work you've done on it is that you don't necessarily need the original creators to tell a good story. So if you can't get the people who put together Super Mario 3D, there are more than enough developers out there who have made 3D platformers who understand why this game is important.
So you might not want to hear my opinion on why I think Super Mario 3D is great, but you're going to listen to the guys who worked on Banjo-Kazooie. So you just learn to adapt, ultimately, and find ways to make the articles you want to make.
You know who's a great interviewee on Metal Gear, actually, is David Hater. I spoke to him about a decade ago for the six-page feature, and obviously he played the character, but he also had a go at adapting the games for the screen at one point as well. So he's quite an unusual interviewee.
But I imagine you've probably filed the piece now, Darran, and it's all done and ready to go.
Pretty much. Well, that's the other thing, isn't it, about working on Mags. Everything is so, everything is so far ahead.
And yeah, it's a non-stop train, isn't it? You finish one issue and you jump right on to the next one. I wouldn't change it for the world.
It's just even now, I've been doing this for quite a while now, and I still get a huge kick about seeing the magazine on the shelves and stuff like that. So hopefully that's never going to go.
So Retro Gamer, Darran, people can go and get this from WH. Smiths or pretty much any newsagents in the land, but where can people get it online if they want to go subscribe or track down a copy?
The easiest place is magazinesdirect.com and you'll be able to buy directly from there.
Nice, it's not called My Favorite Magazines anymore then. That's a better name, so I like that. Okay, awesome Darran, but we'll take a quick break and we'll come back with the PSP draft as promised.
And in between here, I'll put in the lovely PSP sting sound that plays when you start up a game on the machine.
Oh, nice. Nice.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, here's the PSP draft portion of the episode. Brought Darran on because he knows the console incredibly well, and yeah, I think between us we'll come up with some good draft picks, but as ever, we always set the scene for the different hardware we cover in the draft episodes before we get started.
So, to set the scene, Darran, do you wanna talk a bit about the handhelds that tried and failed to break Nintendo's domination of the market? What did they all get wrong?
It's interesting because the PSP pretty much went down the same route as all of these other consoles. So, when you look at the Game Gear, you have the Game Gear ran out at the same time as the Game Boy and the Atari Lynx. And both of those opted for power.
So, they were full color. They were basically pretty impressive. Like the Master System at the time, the Game Gear at the time, so it was effectively a handheld Master System.
The Lynx was a real powerhouse. It was really, really quite technically impressive. And it had all these crazy things.
Like it was obviously backlit and you could like turn the machine round and use either side to play depending on whether you were left or right-handed. And you could even play the games vertically. So, effectively a tape mode for some of the ones that would support it.
But it turned out that you didn't need power and all you needed was great games. And while both like the Game Gear and the Lynx did have decent games, they just didn't have the support that Nintendo had and they didn't have the range of stuff that Nintendo had with the Game Boy. You know, the fact as well that they had obviously Tetris, which is like one of the best packing games ever.
Like I always remember, I would go around like my friend's house and their mums who were like really ancient. So probably like 40 or 50 at the time. And they were like, they were playing on Game Boys.
And it just seemed that everybody had one because you know, a single double, a couple of batteries would last it forever. And these other ones were going for power and they just didn't really have the game libraries to sustain interest. And that happens, that happens every time.
It's like anybody who went up against them didn't really learn from those mistakes. And then you get to the PSP and then things get really, really interesting because even though they also do have that power, I think the most important thing is that they have the brand power of PlayStation. And it was like, it was this immense juggernaut that was just, it was tearing through the games industry.
And it showed that they could apply that to the handheld market. And I think Sega just didn't really have the same pull and Atari certainly didn't have that pull because they were pretty much on their last legs during the late 80s, early 90s. So I think Nintendo have always striven to focus on the games rather than her hardware.
And that's always worked out really well for them.
Yeah, and they've just had such, well, but the original Game Boy had such a long lifespan as well. So you just must imagine the margins on making the hardware and selling the games was bound to be huge because it had been around for so long, was so low powered versus what you could potentially do with hardware, handheld hardware at that time, that it was, yeah, they were just raking it in. And I think that makes complete sense, yeah, that no one had the resources to deliver on the game side ultimately.
So PlayStation Portable gets announced at E3 2003, we covered this in the Best Games of 2003 episode recently, for release in 2004 by Ken Kataragi. It's like the one big reveal at the end of the Sony conference basically. And this is as the PS2 is on top of the world and the GameCube is struggling.
Xbox is doing okay in North America, but it's not exactly thriving. PS2 is completely dominating. So this is definitely PlayStation at one of the peaks of its powers.
They announced the UMD, Universal Media Disc at the same time. This will be the small encased disc that would play the different games on there. They promised it would be more powerful than the original PlayStation and that it could run 480 pixels, 16 by nine video.
It was described by Kataragi as the Walkman of the 21st century. And there's a slide in the presentation that says exactly that. The first critical reaction was quite positive.
People in the theater sound really excited by it. Do you remember much about this reveal, Darran? And do you remember more generally how the PSP was perceived versus the DS in the run up to their launches?
Yeah, I kind of remember this fairly well because I was news editor on GameStem at the time. One of the things I can remember, I think shortly after this, they released that press image in one of the conferences in Japan where it had the flat buttons and the design was slightly different. And I remember trying to get images of it to go in the magazine for our main news story, only to be told by Sony that because those images were only in Japan and there was no official date announced for the PSP in the UK, it effectively didn't exist.
That's such a load of PR nonsense. I got to admire that.
That's incredible. Oh yeah, it's like amazing. So I was always well aware of what the PSP could do because there always seemed to be so much interest whenever we were running news stories.
And eventually we had that image and we just used it all the time. I think they did really well because, like you said, the reaction was really strong. There was a lot of whooping, a lot of cheering.
The PlayStation brand was at the height of its powers. And yeah, it made perfect sense to release a handheld. And I even liked the UMDs because it reminded me of mini discs.
And mini discs were cool. I was rewatching the 2004 actual reveal and I don't know about yourself, but I found that to be a bit muted in comparison. And like it didn't seem to be eliciting the same types of whooping and cheering when it came on screen.
And the actual games they were showing off felt a little lackluster as well. I mean, you have things like Frogger was one of the first games that they showed. Like they showed Frogger before Metal Gear.
And I don't know. It was obvious that they had a lot of money to throw into it. And it was obvious that this was a powerful machine.
And they had like a huge back swell of support. I think there was like close to a hundred developers on board. So it kind of felt big.
And there was already this kind of like, not apathy towards a DS, but everybody seemed to be excited about the PSP. Because the PSP was kind of being described as PS2 level graphics. Whereas the DS was obviously focused on like N64 level.
You know, some people felt the DS was going to be too gimmicky and everything else. So I definitely remember people being more excited about the PSP on the Mag than the DS. Although I think Martin Mares was really into the DS because he was a huge Nintendo fan.
And as it turns out, obviously the DS has become like the best-selling handheld of all time. But you know, the PSP was no slouch.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, first of all, that concept PSP design from 2003, I've not seen that for a long, long time. Until you just mentioned it, it triggered a memory of the thing.
And yeah, just flat everything. It just doesn't look right or practical. And yeah, it's good they went in a slightly different direction with how it ended up looking.
But yeah, that's what I remember. I remember that people just didn't know what to make of the DS interface, the idea of the two screens. And I just don't think people could imagine how it would work or what benefits it would bring or what kind of games it would really...
why that was more interesting than having a traditional handheld. And obviously, I think it took the DS releasing and for there to be that such strong first wave of software on DS that just immediately won people over. And I think, like you say, there's a slightly flat quality to the reveals at E3.
Like, even when you get Metal Gear, you don't get a full Fat Metal Gear, you get a turn-based card game, Metal Gear Acid. And they're kind of doing the thing that Sony would later do with the PS3, where they are talking up the PSP as a multimedia device, as opposed to just being a handheld games console. And so I think that means you get the slightly unusual thing.
We have basically at E3 2004, they have Spider-Man 2 and Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children being showcased as UMD movies, and they get quite a lot of attention there. And yeah, the games have like, it's a bit of an odd mix, Frogger, Ape Escape, Wipeout, Metal Gear Acid, Spider-Man 2, Siphon Filter, Medieval, Dynasty Warriors, Ridge Racer, they're all in there. It's a big mix, but there's not necessarily, well, Wipeout aside probably, not necessarily one or two massive standouts and also not necessarily something that would be like a system seller on the scale that the PS2 was used to with the likes of, you know, like Vice City or Metal Gear Solid 2 or those kinds of like mega, mega hype games.
It doesn't really have one of those. It has a lot of like mid-level games to kick things off. So I think that's a fair assessment.
I was just going to say one of the things that I found quite interesting when looking on Metacritic, not that obviously Metacritic is a B and O for analyzing this sort of stuff, but there are only two PSP games which got more than 90% which I find absolutely astonishing because the PSP's library is pretty rock solid and it had close to 2000 games and there are a lot of good games on there and yet there are only two games which got more than 90%. One of them was Chinatown Wars with 90% and the other one was The First God of War.
Yeah, but meanwhile, the DS has seven, which still doesn't seem like that many for how good the DS library is.
No, that's a fair point. See, Metacritic, not as useful as I hoped it was going to be.
Well, I think something did happen with the PSP where it fell into this awkward part of end of the PS2 generation and start of the PS3 generation. So you had this one-to-one thing of, why would I play, maybe some people thought, why would I play 3D games on this handheld when I could be playing it in HD games or whatever. I wonder if that was maybe part of it.
But I agree, that is a bit strange that these games are so lowball because, yeah, they end up with some pretty amazing stuff as we'll get into. But yeah, their strategy for games was a mix of new IP, extensions of existing franchises and interoperability with PS2 games, which I don't think really happened. And they were big on wireless gaming as well, since it supported Wi-Fi.
In general, I think the DS and PSP reveals have big, sort of like pre-smartphone era energy, just sort of like big emphasis on physical media, big emphasis on, yeah, this console can do everything kind of approach. Whereas now I don't think, you know, no one's really selling you a Steam Deck or a Switch based on the fact that you can watch video on it, for example. But it's a much bigger deal here.
I think probably the last, and I might be wrong here because I am nowhere near up to date on current events as I am with old events. But it does feel like the Xbox One was the last big console to like push the, it can do everything as well as play games.
Yeah, I think that's right. And I don't even know exactly what the PS5 can do on this front. I don't know if it can play MP3s, for example.
I have no idea. Or I don't know what happens if you put a CD in that thing. That's a complete mystery to me.
I don't think CDs work on it. Right, yeah. I could be wrong.
Again, I have got a PS5, but I very rarely use it. So yeah, I genuinely wouldn't know.
Yeah, for sure. So it's interesting to see the differences and the different ways in which these things are sold at the time. So the PSP launched in December 2004 in Japan, then March 2005 in the US and September 2005 in Europe, which is a long way even for the time.
It was $249 in the US and 180 quid in the UK. These are the George Bush years of the dollar being in the toilet. It was a great time for importing stuff, I will say.
It was the fastest selling games console of all time in the UK, and it sold out at Christmas 2005. I remember my parents tried to get me one that year and they just could not get hold of one. Do you remember much about its early days, Darran?
What sold it to you?
What sold it to me was the fact that if I got a PSP, I could write reviews for other magazines. I've always been quite mercenary, and since I've been in the industry, I will generally buy a new system as soon as it comes out. I don't do it now because the magazines aren't around, but you'd buy a system because the editors of their respective magazines would be desperate for coverage, and if you've got a console, you become useful.
I actually had a PSP from the Japanese launch. I brought a Japanese PSP and it came with Darkstalkers and I want to say Luminous, but I think that was a UK release. I definitely had Darkstalkers.
Oh, and I also had Metal Gear Acid, because I think I got mine quite a few months into the Japanese launch, but it was obvious that it wasn't coming out in the UK any time soon. Oh, and there was a tower game by Konami, which wasn't very good, but there wasn't really a lot of stuff around, and I mainly wanted Darkstalkers because I do like fighting games, and at the time it was the best handheld fighting game you'd ever played, even with its, like, NAF loading times, because there were quite a few early PSP games that did have trouble with bad loading. I was always massively impressed by the machine, and the fact that, because everybody on Games TM, most of the designers, they all had, like, iPods, and they'd be listening to music while they were designing, and I was there, and I could, like, watch Spider-Man 2 while I was working.
I actually got told off for that because somebody said, you can't watch films during work, and I said, but I'm just listening to it. It's no different from... You can imagine how basically belligerent I was.
And, yeah, basically, I loved it. I loved it so much that when I'd had mine for about six, seven months, and I accidentally sat on it and broke it, so I just brought another one, and they weren't cheap. I think the biggest takeaway at the time was how much the actual storage capacity cards were.
So I brought mine, I think, from Lick Sang, and a one gigabyte memory card was 100 quid. So I had all the cost of the PSP and the two or three games I brought for it, plus 100 quid just so I could save my games.
Yeah, buying the SD card, that was the first time I'd ever had to do anything like that, basically. I imagine it was the first encounter for a lot of people with that sort of flash storage media, basically, and just needing to think about that as an element in buying your console as opposed to buying the proprietary memory card at the end with the PS2, or it was built in as it was with the cartridges on the SNES or whatever. It was, yeah, that was a consideration for sure.
I vaguely remember, I don't think it was massively on my radar, the PSP, because I looked at, of all the games that were coming out, the one that would have appealed to me the most was Metal Gear Asset, and the fact that it was a turn-based game, I realized that turn-based games, I feel like have only really grown in cache since Metal Gear Asset. It's a huge, huge, RPG strategy games. They're a huge part of the modern games mix, and there are so many of them, but at the time, I remember thinking Metal Gear Asset seemed incredibly unsexy, a sort of like card turn-based game.
It just wasn't what I wanted as someone who was like, you know, this was like MGS3 era, and such a phenomenal game. This was such a different proposition. And I wasn't super excited by the stuff Sony was making, even though Wipeout Pure looked incredibly impressive.
But the thing that sold it to me was Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories. And so when that came along, it was just such a kind of like amazing showstopping thing to behold. Because I'd heard the screen was really impressive, the PSP screen when reading about it in magazines.
But I don't think I really understood it until I got one on Christmas Day 2005. I popped in Liberty City Stories. I just saw how bright it was.
And it was seeing this game changing open world of Liberty City crammed onto a handheld and seeing these Rockstar cut scenes to more or less the same visual quality as the PS2 games. That was truly amazing. I genuinely remember where I was sat in this holiday home in Spain when I first saw that.
That screen was so, so amazing. And paired with GTA, that felt like it was a real trump card for Sony to have Rockstar support. They were obviously very close with Rockstar at the time.
And Liberty City Stories would go on to be the best selling PSP game of all time, more generally. It was the biggest selling one. And I think for a lot of people, particularly in the UK, GTA was the thing that made it sell out.
It was just like, I've got to have the full-fat GTA experience on a handheld. That was such a powerful proposition. But the rest of the games, not so much.
Didn't really do it for me. So, Darran, I was curious what... Do you remember when you first saw that screen?
Do you remember how impressive that just seemed to someone who had only ever played like the GBA or whatever it was?
Yeah, so like I said, it's funny you've mentioned this now, because I now remember one of the other launch games I brought, and it was Ridge Racer, because the editor of DVD Next would keep coming over to my desk to look at Ridge Racer, because he couldn't... he couldn't comprehend how amazing it looked. And yeah, the screen was incredible at the time.
You could make the argument now that obviously it does feel like it's a little washed out and underpowered, but at the time there was nothing like it. And the Darkstalkers game I mentioned, that just looked great, because it had like these really vibrant sprites, and games like Everybody's Golf would just seem to pop.
And you know, it really was a fantastic device in so much that it did feel really, really cut an edge. You get all that stuff where you'd read about the PS Vita and everybody would be like, that screen. And while obviously the PSP's screen can't compete with the Vita's OLED screen, it still had that energy about it, that that was the kind of thing that most reviews at the time, that's what they were focusing on because there just wasn't anything else like it, like you said.
Yeah, it was just truly desirable tech. And I think you're right. There's one thing I think that's common across so many PSP games is that the PSP games in 3D is that they do seem a bit washed out.
For whatever reason, the way the console renders 3D visuals is just a little bit kind of cardboardish and a little bit, by today's standards, just not quite... The colors just don't quite pop the way that you obviously are used to from playing something like the Switch or the Vita. But yeah, it's that thing of, relatively speaking, the PSP screen at the time was more impressive than the Vita screen was during its time.
It was just that thing of, I've seen nothing like this before. This is just out of this world. So yeah, handhelds will never be able to replicate that feeling again.
It's amazing to see the jump, to play something like God of War on your Steam Deck and to see something like that running on a handheld. That's still impressive, but it's just the leap at the time felt enormous. So we touched on UMD movies, Darran.
They're a big part of the mix, at least in the initial parts of when they were selling it. E3 2004, like I say, Spider-Man 2, Advent Children, they were big parts of what they were trying to get people excited about. In retrospect, UMD movies seem quite quaint, but the PSP awkwardly launched before the age of downloadable movies and smartphones, so it made more sense in the moment.
What did you think of UMDs at the time, and do you still have any UMDs?
I don't have any anymore. I did used to get quite into them because it was rad to use a 90s term to basically watch stuff. Because again, there wasn't really many options to watch films on the move, like you obviously have now.
I picked up quite a few, and it was more focused on the big-budget AAA movies, so I'd imagine that if it had been around at the time, I'd have had possibly a half-complete collection of all the good Marvel films on it. But I've still got my Spider-Man 2, and I literally booted it up yesterday, and it still looks really good. I think they were going for 720p, and one of the things that you mentioned earlier about how good GTA looks is one of the benefits that handhelds have in general anyway is that because everything shrunk down, you don't really see the deficiencies in the way if you were playing it on a bigger screen, so the small size of the screen does a lot of the heavy lifting in how it actually looks.
I thought they were really cool, and I think you can still pick them up for next to nothing now. So if you did have this mad desire to own every movie, and I think there was a good 400 or so released, you'd probably be able to get them at a decent price. But yeah, they were amazing at the time.
But as you said, because it was before the advent of proper downloading, it never seemed practical to walk around with five or six films in your pocket. Because that's what I used to do. I'd catch the bus in and I'd watch 10, 15 minutes of a film, and then I'd finish it off during my lunch break.
Once I was no longer allowed to watch them during work. I don't understand that. If you're just listening to music, how is that any different to just listening to a movie?
I obviously have a hard thing letting things in the past go.
Twenty years ago, still a man about it.
But it was cool.
And in all fairness, despite all the bullshittery stance of this is going to be the Walkman for now, it genuinely did feel like it could do everything. And not only that, at the time it did everything as well as you could possibly expect it to.
Yeah, it was just so... It was cut against, that's the thing. I think UMDs in general don't...
The thing is when you compare UMDs to a DS cart, for example, DS carts, just a standard test of time is a nice thing that you want to keep. Whereas UMD movies in their weird little plastic case and the fact that when you eject the disc at the back of the PSP, it's that spring thing where it feels like it's going to break every time you open it, basically. It feels slightly rickety as a sort of format.
It does feel very dated. But yeah, at the time, like you said, the video was of a really high quality. I had advent children on PSP.
I don't know if I had many more UMDs other than that. I'm shocked to hear that amongst your PSP collection, you don't have Little Britain Series 1 on UMD, Darran. That's disappointing.
But it is really funny to see the kind of films that were on UMD, the kind of era it represents, just like everything from like Dodgeball to like Rain of Fire with Christian Bale or whatever. It's just such random nonsense on there. But yeah, there was a hot minute where it seemed like UMDs made sense for sure.
So the PSP ultimately sold 80 million units. I feel like its success was quite staggered, especially given how the DS took off like a rocket when the DS light hit. And Brain Training was a huge success, and Animal Crossing was a huge success, Mario Kart.
It seemed like the DS got the software right straight away, whereas the PSP, it took time for them to find the right software. And I think that its success was gradual. And at the time, I think people maybe thought the PSP was a bit of a failure, Darran.
But what do you think? Do you think it felt like a success while it was happening, the PSP?
It's weird, isn't it, because lots of people still refer to the PSP as a failure. And it sold 80 million units. It sold nearly as many as the GBA.
It basically outsold the N64, it outsold the Super Nintendo, it outsold the NES. And they are not consoles that you would consider failures. And I think it doesn't help that as valiant an attempt Sony made.
Because 80 million is nothing to sniff at. But when you obviously look at it next to the DS, which did something like 140 million or something, it does feel like it was this distinct runner up. But again, my perception is obviously slightly warped, because obviously I was on the game side of it.
So pretty much everybody who was on the PlayStation mags had a PSP. Lots of people on Games TM had PSPs. I can remember that I would get together at lunchtimes with some of the guys on XPM, and we would play multiplayer Liberty City stories.
A few of my friends had them as well, but there did seem to be more people with a DS. And I do wonder if a lot of that was more down to the fact that it did genuinely offer something different, because I think one of the biggest strengths of the PSP also turned out to be one of its biggest weaknesses, and you touched on it earlier, in that while it was incredibly impressive and while it could give you these experiences that you could play on your big TV, you could still play them on your big TV, and they were still generally better, whereas the DS, you couldn't experience those games any other way than on that console. And again, going back to the whole power thing, by targeting a previous gen, I'd imagine the costs for the DS were nowhere near as extravagant as the PSP, even with the dual screens and stuff.
I remember a lot of action around the PSP, I don't know if you remember this Samuel, 2009, and you had the big triple hitter of LittleBigPlanet, Assassin's Creed and Gran Turismo, and they all came out within a few months of each other, and that seemed like there was this big effort from Sony to keep the machine relevant.
Yeah, I remember that, and I remember before that slightly, it might have been 08, maybe slightly earlier, it had Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection on there, which is a real powerhouse showcase of what it could do. And yeah, and Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII as well, which is lots and lots of Square Enix bank poured into making that handheld game feel like a huge deal on PSP. So yeah, I think it was slowly accumulating, I think in that 05, 06 window, other than the likes of Liberty City Stories or another game I'll discuss shortly actually.
But like, there just wasn't that much on there. And I remember owning one, looking around and thinking, oh, the more exciting stuff's happening on DS. But once you get to 09, 2010, Nintendo's...
DS is still getting good games, but it's not at the same clip that they were in the early part of the DS's lifespan. There's just so much upfront, amazing, timeless stuff on DS. Whereas, yeah, PSP, very slowly earned.
Obviously, a huge part of it in Japan was Monster Hunter coming out on PSP, and that becoming a huge kind of like LAN, sort of like local multiplayer kind of experience, not local, what's it called, like wireless, you know, sort of like co-op multiplayer experience.
The LAN, wasn't it like wireless LAN or something?
Yeah, exactly, WLAN experience. So that just, that became a huge deal for it in Japan. The other thing that did happen that I do wonder if maybe this is part of why PSP is not remembered as a success, it was absolutely ravaged by piracy, particularly in the second half of its life.
So there were just games that were, I think it was something like the original God of War Chains of Olympus sold like several million copies. And then when they did Ghost of Sparta, I think it struggled to sell like one million copies. And it was basically just down to the fact that it had been cracked and every new game, day one was basically just out there to be pirated.
So really hit badly by that. Obviously the DS was hit by this too. That was part of I think why they thought Chinatown Wars flopped on DS was because piracy was so bad at that point.
But yeah, it's interesting. Like you say, I think there's a bit of, it just seems like such an obvious runner up next to the DS. But, you know, to look back on having both of these consoles at the same time offering such different types of software, this is kind of a golden age of handheld games consoles.
They were both great to own. You always had something to play on both of them. Past a certain point, the PSP had a regular clip of good software and I think what we pick in the draft will be testament to that.
So the PSP could do quite a lot as a multimedia device. You could use it as an MP3 player. You could rip a video from DVDs and dump them on there.
And eventually became one of the first proper emulation handhelds as well. I remember giving mine to an unnamed person in the office, Darran, and then putting Snatcher on my PSP. That was very exciting.
Didn't finish it, but really cool to have on there. I was curious what your personal relationship to the PSP is, Darran. You mentioned that obviously you bought one to get freelance at the time.
That was very savvy. I do remember you doing that with every major console release now that you mention it. But what do you make of it looking back?
What was your personal connection to it?
One of the things I personally love about the PSP is that it's such a retro games machine. And what I mean by that is... Because we actually cover the PSP quite a lot in Retro Gamer.
Because if there wasn't a compilation coming out, there was a remake of an old franchise or there was a brand new game based on an existing franchise like After Burner. Or you had basically arcade style, retro style games like Pursuit Force. So it just really spoke to me as a console because it kind of offered...
Because I've always said that. I didn't see the point in Console Wars and like back in consoles. It doesn't matter who makes the consoles.
It matters what games are on it. And the PSP, and the DS for that matter, the PSP just had loads and loads of great retro themed games. And, you know, I'm looking at my collection now and I've got things like Wipeout in it.
I've got R-Type, I've got Ridge Racer, I've got Ace Combat, I've got Activision Compilations, the Afterburner game that came out.
So it just felt to me like it could do everything. You had the big AAA stuff in the forms of GTA and Monster Hunter and all of that, but you just had these really quirky, interesting games. There was Ultimate Ghouls and Ghosts, Mega Man powered up.
So yeah, I still love it. I think it's a great system and there are certain games which even now I'll still fire up once a month to play.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's a funny one because my connection to it over time, I actually did note at the time that there just seemed to be a lot of ports or compilations, like you said. I had a quite average Mega Drive collection on PSP.
It was just all right, if I recall, but there was just so much of that stuff around, really nice versions of something like Final Fantasy IV complete collection, for example. It was the only place you could get both those games with original pixel art, visuals, and then also the FMVs they added, I think from the DS version they'd made. It was just a really nice package, and it was only on PSP, and that would happen a bunch of times.
So, yeah, looking at games, there's something I'm not going to pick, Darran, but I wonder if you might pick. It's like the Gradius collection that's on there, for example. It's just, you know, that level of stuff is...
Yeah, it's quite unusual for its time, really, to just have that much retro stuff but also only come to this handheld and not anywhere else. Quite interesting. So, yeah, so my personal connection to it, my parents imported one, I think, from Hong Kong.
It was like a white one, and you couldn't get it in the UK at the time. I think they paid something like 190 quid, so slightly over the odds to get it imported. I loved it.
And when I played Liberty City Stories, I was incredibly impressed by it. But I do remember it feeling like there was a proper software drought in that first 05, 06 window. And then I remember reading online about a Japanese-only demo for a game called LocoRoco.
And then downloading, I remember specifically hooking up to the Wi-Fi in my sixth form library and downloading this 8 megabyte file that was the LocoRoco demo and just being overwhelmed by how lovely it was and how perfect it was for the system. And I felt very hopeful off the back of that. And then it sort of like it did slowly snowball.
Like I became because I got it was after I got the PSP in about, I think it was March 06 around that time, I bought a DS Lite and I bought Phoenix Wright and Animal Crossing Wild World and those that just became the sort of like Vanguard of my handheld affections for a while. But over time, I think the PSP really paid off as a purchase. I remember huge moment when Chains of Olympus came out because that seemed to be like there.
There was like Daxter before that, the Jack and Daxter spin off, which was also by the developer Ready at Dawn. It's this very impressive console-like experience on a handheld. But Chains of Olympus was the one where it was like slightly bigger, sexier, more mature and really, really impressive.
And I think by the time I was on Play Magazine in 2007, I didn't have... When I first started, I was on a desk next to a PSP debug unit. Do you remember that thing, Darran?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact, I think I've got one up in my loft. Because obviously when the offices shut down, we obviously had to clear everything out.
And I think one of them definitely went to the bath office. And then I think I might have one because again, working from home, so we may need to use them at some point. But yeah, they were kind of like big PC towers.
And then they had that weird appendage coming out of them. Because the PSP was on it, wasn't it? Or did you add it?
It was a UMD drive that was on the unit itself of Oracle.
Yes, that's right.
And there's a big dark wire that connects the PSP to the machine itself. It was a really cursed looking thing. But it was fascinating seeing the UMD drive on the side of one of those old school beige PC tower sort of things.
It was a really unusual thing. But it was quite easy to take screenshots of it, if I recall.
You got decent ones as well, didn't you? Because it was still that cursed area of games journalism where most of the actual systems obviously didn't have ways to take their own in-game screenshots. And most of the actual stuff that you were using was often putting out really ropey looking S-video.
And yeah, I recall the PSP grabber being fairly decent.
Yeah, it was pretty good. But yeah, I'm glad you remember that because it was a very strange thing to wrangle that. But it worked way better than the fucking PS3 capture screenshot thing.
Nothing ever worked. That was a horrible, horrible nightmare. That software we had for that PC in the corner behind the sofas where all the cover meetings would happen.
So you'd just be there trying to get fucking heavenly sword screenshots while someone's cover is being ripped to shreds basically.
Yeah, yeah, hearing someone crying outside.
Exactly.
One thing, I'm sorry Samuel, one thing I did want to quickly mention about, because when you were talking about the UMD, the actual discs, is that they haven't weathered time very well in that they'll often split. So when you look at obviously the cartridge design of the DS, that's really nice and solid. And I do think one of the things that I've got so many PSP games which are held together by tape because the glue that was holding the two sides together has just started to come away with time.
Yeah, that's interesting. Mine are okay, but they've all been inside this one little wallet thing I've had for a long time. I kind of regret not keeping more of them.
I think maybe when I had to move twice, I threw out a bunch of the old boxes. I don't have those anymore. But I've kept about seven UMDs.
They're just about hanging in there. I can see there's some dirt under the disk of one of them as well. I'm like, what a fucking nightmare to clean these things are.
They are a bit dated, like you say. The only other thing I was going to say was, to me, it really felt like... I think you are right that the PSP was following the blueprint of the Game Gear and shrinking all other earlier handhelds, shrinking down the console experience into a handheld.
But the fact that it was an online games console, it must be one of the, if not the first, one of the first handhelds you could download games onto. Like, it had the PlayStation Store on there. The games had DLC as well.
Yeah, and you had the PlayStation Classics. Yeah, exactly. PS1 games you could get on there.
It was ahead of the DS on this. Obviously, that launch with Online Play, they had that, but they didn't have, until the DSi, a digital store on there. So it was quite a contemporary thing.
And the media player side of it, I really envy the amount of time I had as a sick former to just sit there and burn Simpsons DVDs to my parents' PC, fucking shrink them with this program to work on my PSP. And when I played them on there, the audio to be slightly out of sync. To the afternoons, I would waste on that kind of bullshit.
In some ways, I think it was one of the first hobbyist tinkerer kind of hand helds, you know? It's sort of…
Yeah, absolutely.
And that side of things is just really interesting.
And, you know, we obviously mentioned piracy, but that did play a big part of it. Like, if you look at the PlayStation, the PlayStation was very easily piratable at the time. And that didn't…
That seemed to accelerate people wanting to get it. And the fact that, like you said, you can do so much on the PSP. And even now, it's got a vibrant homebrew scene.
And the sheer amount of emulators, the sheer amount of… It's just a very, very versatile device.
Yeah, absolutely. And so, yeah, I think to look back on it, it's sort of like, yeah, I'm very fond of it for a bunch of different reasons, but its versatility was definitely a strength. You know, I wouldn't use it often as an MP3 player, but I think it did have a couple of albums on there in case I was on a press trip and I just needed to listen to some music or something.
So yeah, lots of affection for it, lots of affection for that home screen. And it was a little bit dry and a little bit like, they saw it as a kind of lifestyle device. You could tell that, I think, in the way the interface was designed.
But it was, yeah, a super nice system. I really liked it, held onto it, still got mine now. It is in the filthiest, like, white sleeve.
I should really give that a wash, but it still works. And yeah, I make sure I recharge it every now and then so I don't get the big battery explosion thing that a lot of people seem to be getting recently.
Yeah, I was going to ask you about that because that's one of the things that I'm always checking and thankfully mine's okay. Did you end up getting one of the later versions? Because obviously they did do quite a lot of iterations of the PSP, including the PSP Go, which is like, that was hugely ambitious and it flopped big time.
I think there's one of the later versions which you can connect up to a TV with component leads and stuff. There was loads of different models and that. They really did go for it ultimately in trying to usurp Nintendo.
I think they took a damn good stab at it.
Yeah, for sure. Did you have a PSP Go, Darran? That seems like the kind of bullshit you would have had.
Yes, I've literally got it here in my hands now. I've got this amazing video on YouTube where I show people my PSP Go collection. It's just literally me pointing at a shelf.
An empty shelf with nothing on it going like, this is Grand Theft Auto, this is Monster Hunter, blah, blah, blah. I think the thing with that is I just like the design because they'd obviously based it on their phone. And I love the way you could flip it up to get to the controls underneath.
But generally, it was obviously, it was far too early to consider a digitally hand-held.
Yeah, I'm trying to think in retrospect, what could they have done differently? The one big thing was there were so many games that were not on the PlayStation Store from PSP, particularly from third-party publishers. So they never put Crisis Core on there, they never put Kingdom Hearts on there.
Some of the other Final Fantasy games were on there, like FFIV and Tactics, War of the Lions, they were on there. But yeah, it was a lot of stuff missing. And yeah, like you say, too early.
It was a bit too expensive as well. It looked really nice though, a really lovely looking thing. And I kind of wish I had one these days, so I'm a little bit jealous.
But yeah, they had... I didn't have any of the other late hardware revisions, but yeah, they tried to get a lot out of it. So on the peripheral side, they had the GoCam, which is quite a nice little nifty camera thing, not massively consequential in the age of obviously smartphones having cameras built in and stuff.
But another interesting thing, you literally had little screws so you could screw it on to the top of your PSP in the USB slot. There was a microphone they had for Talkman, the translation software that didn't seem to work very well. But it's quite an interesting artifact of the early PSP years.
There was a TV tuner. Even Metal Gear Acid 2 had this sort of like bullshit 3D glasses cardboard thing.
Oh yeah, the Perf camera.
So it was just a very of its time kind of attempt to extend what it could do. But pretty cool in retrospect. It was a bit of a jack of all trades machine.
Who do you think the real winners were on PSP, Darran, both on the developer and publisher side?
Well, Rockstar obviously did really, really well on the system. So they're the ones that instantly came to mind. But also Capcom, Konami released some great stuff on it.
And even though it's more casual, EA was quite the force on there. It's weird because as much as there are some really good first party games on there, like Wipeout and stuff, I tend to think of the third party. And Ready at Dawn was probably one of the shining jewels in that.
Like you said, you had Daxter, which was amazing. We did a making of that recently, actually, which was quite interesting. And the God of War games were like spectacular.
So they were really pushing what the machine could do. But yeah, I think it was interested in that companies like Capcom felt a lot more important on it than Sony did, if that makes sense. To me, at least, anyway.
No, I completely agree. I think if there's one thing that separates the PSP and DS generation from the Vita and 3DS generation, it's that third party Japanese publishers just invested loads more in PSP and DS. And it really shows in the depth of the library.
So like Konami, Capcom and Square Enix, they all have amazing stuff on PSP. And that just changes. And handhelds are not the center of the universe by the time the next generation comes along.
And I agree, Ready at Dawn really up there, Rockstar really up there. I think as well, Sony's Japan studio, they're just between the two-hander of LocoRoco and Patapon. Just really, really great ways to sort of use the user system.
And yeah, some of the series that they did port over to PSP just worked really well. Like Little Big Planet was a very lavish feeling thing. It was slow for some of the big series to get onto there.
But once they did, they just always came in like all singing, all dancing sort of packages.
Yeah. Well, look at Gran Turismo. Look how long that took to come onto the system.
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Oh, nine.
So long, long time. Long wait for that one. And yeah, like I think in general as well.
Like Kojima obviously had a lot of affection for this. So Kojima Productions, the amount of Metal Gear that's on this thing, relatively speaking, is really like this. I think technically there's three Metal Gear games on on PS3, whereas there's like four or five, if you count the graphic novel one on on PSP.
It's just obviously like a lot of support for it from him specifically. He seemed interested in it. So yeah, that's like a big deal.
Yeah, there's just plenty of people just found success on the system. Obviously the PSP's successor, like I say, is the Vita, which is not nearly as successful, doesn't sell nearly as well. Is there anything you think the PSP did better or worse than the Vita, Darran?
It had better games. Yeah. I mean, ultimately, consoles live or die by their games.
And while the PS Vita had some astonishing stuff on it, it just didn't feel like it had the support that PSP had. So I loved the Vita. I had one on launch day.
I had five or six games for, again, freelance opportunities. And it is a great console. And at one point, I had a silly amount of games for it.
I got onto a real collecting vibe with it. But ultimately, yeah, it doesn't really have the range of genres that PSP has. And it certainly didn't get the big hitters.
I don't think there was ever a GTA game on Vita. So I could be wrong about that. But I don't think there was.
But no, I think by that point, because again, you were effectively trying to sell it as a PS3, people didn't seem to be as excited as they were about having a handheld PS2. Which is obviously how the PSP was pitched.
Yeah, by that point as well, you've also got smartphones have just changed that landscape massively. And so, yeah, just the handheld side of games goes on a bit of a... It's on the back foot a little bit.
The 3DS does pretty well, but not nearly as well as the DS. And yeah, they just don't find the same casual audience on there. But obviously things have swung back around.
And these sorts of handhelds are in vogue now. And the funny thing about the Switch is, it's sort of like the Switch has got more in common with the PSP and the PS Vita than it does with the DS, arguably.
Yeah, yeah, I'd agree with that.
Yeah, just in terms of form factor, obviously, but also just the sheer amount of retro stuff that's come to Switch. It feels like that's a big part of the PSP's DNA, like you said earlier. So yeah, super interesting.
Any other thoughts on the PSP, Darran, before we move on to the draft?
No, I think we've done a good job of covering all the aspects of it.
Yeah, I think so too. It starts in, say, 04, 05, then runs to about 2010. Basically, the PSP has run out of steam.
But in that life, it has a consistent array of great stuff, many of which is bound to come up in the draft. So let's take a quick break there and I will come back with the PSP draft finally after an hour and a half.
So, it's BSP draft time after an hour and a half preamble, as it's pretty standard on this podcast at this point. We come to the PSP Draft. So, a few things to note.
We're going to pin the poll on Twitter again this time. No, it's not because I lost the game Soundtracks Draft. It's because I want Darran's followers to be able to find the PSP Draft voting quite easily.
We do also get a lot more votes on Twitter as well, so that'll be pinned at Backpage Pod on Twitter for a week, so you can vote for the winner. Darran, I'm curious as someone coming into this draft for the first time. I think you're the first ever guest who's been part of a draft.
How have you found that process of deciding for the different categories?
Terrifying. So I've been doing research on previous drafts and I'm re-listening to them again, and I feel like I'm David going up against Goliath, but I've actually forgotten my fucking sling shot. Because you're really fucking good at pulling unexpected upper cuts from nowhere, so I'm not looking forward to being on the end of those.
Well, look, people always vote against that kind of bullshit though. Like the N64 draft I lost, people were angry that I picked Golden Eye and Perfect Dark, even though it's meant to be a competitive draft.
Exactly.
People were angry about that. They were angry about me picking Smash Bros for the game soundtrack's draft. They reckon that was cheating and voted against it.
That was annoying. People told me, oh yeah, you can't just win based on that and then voted for the We Shop channel music instead. And so that was very annoying.
So anytime I've done that kind of chicanery, it's always blown up in my face. The listeners are like, no, this is a vote against your lack of morality. And I'm like, right, fine.
I was curious, actually, were there any kind of like draft picks or draft votes? Were there any kind of particular drafts where you thought we were out of our depth or any you thought were better than others? Because there are definitely some systems we know better than others.
Like, I was curious what you kind of made of them overall.
No, not really. The only thing that I sometimes have an issue with and is a very minor thing is when you obviously, when you do your game court shows and you talk about like, this is too much for like a game and stuff and it's like, yeah, it absolutely is too much for a game. But unfortunately, that's the game market now.
And I do feel sometimes that maybe you guys should be a bit more linear on the fact that yes, £120 say for this game is stupid. But if that's the going rate, if you want to own that, you don't really have a choice. Particularly if you can't get it on another system.
I do like, though, how you're both very good advocates, again, going back to the Games Corps, you're both very good advocates of just get a version you can play. And that's not piracy. But if there's a downloadable option, go for that.
Because why pay £160 on a PS1 game when you can get it on the PS3 store? But yeah, like I said, I haven't listened to every episode of the show because there's a fucking lot of them. But I'm getting through them.
And they're the aspects that I enjoy. And I've never, like I said, apart from Last of Us, when you were discussing the game and the TV show, and I know Matthew's obviously not a huge fan of Naughty Dog games, generally, that's the only time when I was like, ehh.
He does like Naughty Dog games. He just doesn't like the ox patting. And I think the funny thing is, I've got this weird thing with The Last of Us, where I think the first one, I find the first one quite self-important.
And then the second one, that game, I really vibe with how kind of violent it is, and how just like nihilistic it is. That's actually, that appealed to me in a way. I didn't think it would.
So I weirdly have a lot more affection for that second one than the first one. But anyway, yeah, it's interesting to hear that perspective. And we don't always get things right.
Like there was, on the PS1 draft, I mentioned I've never heard of the game G Darius. I went and played that recently, and that's a fucking banger of a shooter. You all obviously know that game very well.
But obviously, later on, you heard me talk about Einhander on that episode, which is in the same genre. And arguably, that's where you have the knowledge gaps of like, no, I didn't play both of those games. But, you know, we're always trying to learn on this podcast.
We're always trying to move forward. But as for the sort of like David versus Goliath thing, I'm going to go easy on you, Darran. You're a guest.
I'm not going to do any bullshit. I've got a solid array of picks here. But I'm not going to try and take things that I think you might take because you have areas of expertise that I definitely don't, especially on the kind of like retro front, either retro adjacent or the compilation and the ports that came to PSP.
So it's all good. All I'll say is just try and enjoy it. Feel into the things that you love and I'm sure it'll all be okay.
So we come to the old coin toss. Actually, no, that's not true because I've got to read out the categories first. I've forgotten how I do this.
So I've got 10 categories here. Actually, that's another question I'll have for you, Darran. What did you think of the categories here?
Do you think I got the PSP represented well here or is the focus a little bit wrong? What do you think?
I think it's fine. I mean, I was thinking of suggesting maybe we should split up the racing slash sports because there are so many banging racing games on PSP. And I was struggling at one point with the music based game category.
It felt a little underserved compared to the others. But yeah, I mean, they're all solid. I think the Rockstar one, even though I'm not a huge fan of Rockstar, I think you've got to have that category.
I think because of obviously the way I am, some of the categories I might try and get some wiggle room on because shooter to me could be any range of things from Gradius Collection to a Call of Duty game.
Yeah.
But yeah, no, I think that's some good stuff. And I also like the fact that we've got two free picks.
Yeah, yeah. OK, here's my suggestion then. And I never normally do this.
What if we get rid of music based game and we do break racing and sports into two different categories? And then if any music based game can be picked up in the other categories, would that be too wild if I change this on the fly?
I've got my choices, so I am quite happy to keep them as it is because the other suggestion was to have 11 categories and that's crazy. So I don't want to break the system as the first guess on it. I was thinking though that this has got the potential to be like two really strong mini systems, but an overall system because I know that obviously both picks get combined together into like an ultra mini console, but a less impressive ultra mini console.
Yeah, I've definitely got about 15 to 20 picks overall and backups for all the different categories. And yeah, there's some genres that are really well served on there. I did think the same thing about racing and sports when I was going through the picks.
I was like, oh, fuck, there's so many racing games on this thing and lots of good sports games. You can even have fucking tennis games as a category on this console.
Yeah, absolutely, because Virtua Tennis and then obviously Hot Shot Golf is really, really good fun.
Yeah, so there's loads of stuff. So people might disagree with some of the... Music based game is interesting.
What I'll do just for the listeners then, I'll just give them the context of what these categories are. So category one, perfect for PSP. So I think that's implied by the title, but it's built very nicely around either the interface or the strengths and limitations of the PSP.
Category two, console level blockbuster. So this is something that mimics a PS2 scale experience or is in a series that is otherwise best known for being on a PlayStation console, home console. Category three, port, remake or compilation.
Category four, RPG. Category five, shooter. Category six, the Rockstar Games category.
So any game made by Rockstar published on the system. Category seven, racing or sports game. Category eight, music based game.
Category nine, free pick one. Category 10, free pick two. So yes, I think sometimes as well with the categories, some of the drama is in having some where you can only pick one or two things just to kind of like create a bit of competition there.
But yeah, I think it will shake out to two good lists regardless, Darran. So the free picks gives you a lot of leeway, I would say, to make things happen. Okay, all right, anything else you want to note before we get started?
Or should I do the coin toss? No, I'm all prepared. Let's do it.
All right, I'll do the coin toss, Darran. I'm going to let you decide. So what would you like, heads or tails?
I'll go for tails, please.
It is tails. So you can decide whether to go first and have the first pick or to go the second and third picks, basically. It's up to you.
So I've played this scenario over in my head so many times.
It's like Edge of Tomorrow.
Yeah, I'm just a less handsome version of Tom Cruise. And I'm going to go second because while I'm pretty sure that you're going to pick a game that I really want, I can at least, hopefully, use the second to get two of my heart picks in.
Yeah, fair enough. The thing is, the reason I don't sound too cut up about losing a coin toss is I think similarly. There's a lot you can grab in second and third.
So I don't mind going first. There is something I think needs to come off the board. So fair enough.
Okay, so my first pick is going to be Category 2 Console Level Blockbuster and I'm going to take God of War Chains of Olympus. So played for you both this and Ghost of Sparta for our God of War episode in 2022. As mentioned infamously during the death of Queen Elizabeth II, I was playing God of War Ascension when that happened.
That was quite a strange moment. Yeah, so Chains of Olympus was the first of the two games to come to PSP. It focuses on a bit of Kratos' lore that hadn't been explored by the Consuls, which is what happened with his daughter, essentially.
Like what it does into Kratos' family in a way that obviously the PS4 game were doing a lot more sort of like detail with his next family, essentially. But this was such an amazing out of the gates showcase of what the PSP could do. The sort of like opening sort of like siege set piece just feels so enormous in scale.
You just have the kind of like big God of War monster experience straight out of the gate. You have the QTEs, you have the abilities, you have the similar weapons, but not exactly the same weapons from the PS2 games. Just a really confident, amazing system seller of an experience.
And it's like it's not massively long. You'll finish it in about five or six hours. But in that, you'll get so much of the God of War spectacle.
It feels so close to the real thing, quote unquote, on consoles, that it's just really up there. And in some ways, I think it's front-loaded. Like that first set piece is as large scale as it ever gets.
And that was like the demo of the game that they would use to sell it. But holy shit, what an amazing way to sort of like convey the Kratos, the PS2, PS3 era of Kratos onto the PSP. And so, yeah, Ghost of Sparta definitely has its moments and definitely is visually ambitious and different in quite a lot of ways.
But Chains of Olympus was just the one where I was like, they've finally done it, they've finally done that console experience on a handheld in a way that doesn't feel like a rehash necessarily, which the GTA games arguably do, because you've seen those settings before. An original God of War story in your hands. Really impressive for the time.
And like Darran said, the top-reviewed game on the system. What are your thoughts on this pick, Daz?
It's a really, really good pick. And it's not the pick I thought you were going to make, but I think I know the reasonings why you won't pick it. But yeah, I mean, and this is what I mean about at the beginning of the draft, where yes, it's annoying that you've taken Chains of Olympus, but I could look at taking Ghost of Sparta, and we're both going to have genuinely great God of War games on our little pretty small PlayStation.
So I think there's going to be a lot of that because there are so many good quality sequels that, you know, I can't get upset that you would take that because it's like it's an obvious one to go for.
Yeah, absolutely. It's like there are some, there are very few categories where there's only one pick for that category. In fact, arguably, there are arguably none of those because some genres are just so well served on this handheld.
But the thing is, Ghost of Sparta was the one where I couldn't reasonably make a case and be like, I love this game. I found it a bit of a pain in the ass when I played it. So particularly towards the end, when you're fighting endless lads on boats, that just did my head in.
And I slightly prefer Chains of Olympus. So yeah, listen to our God of War episode for more of my thoughts on that. But what's your first pick, Darran?
Right then. So my first pick, I'm going with Shooter. And I'm going with Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.
Yep, great pick.
So this is one of the ones which I thought you might go for, but also because of obviously how you typically approach these things, that I'm well aware that this game is available elsewhere and it's greatly improved in the controls department. But this is such a solid addition to the series. It's got literal world building because you create the bases of Outer Heaven as you play, and you can obviously employ all these soldiers and even like, rank bosses and stuff to help you.
It's got a strong, and it's only slightly bonkers in the story department at its core. And it introduces the mission structure, which you could argue paved its way into Metal Gear Solid V. So, I don't know, in some ways for me, this feels like, I've heard very hushed corners of the internet suggest that this has the story that Metal Gear Solid IV should have had.
But I'll never know that for sure because I've never been able to get past that painful cut scene in Metal Gear IV where Otagon Professors is love for one of the other characters. But it's just really, really good. It's perfect for pick up and play.
Some of the missions can be done in very little time. There's a lot of flexibility to how you approach the game. I love the way the story is told through the panels There's just a lot to like about it.
And I'm not the biggest fan of the stealthy side of the series, but I don't feel that that's as important here. The flexibility of it allows you to brute force your way through if you need to do that.
Yeah, it's really impressive. This is a good pick in the sense that I think Portal Blobs is a bit of an underpowered pick next to this. That's kind of like a test run for what Peace Walker would be, I think.
It does all the things that you want from a Metal Gear. And then, yeah, like this is like the... In some ways, I think this is basically a Metal Gear solid numbered entry in all but name, because it's just the format of it is a bit different.
Like it is smaller levels, obviously, and you do have the space building aspect, which Five would later build on massively. It is a bit... It's not quite as straightforward a Metal Gear experience as MGS4 is, but it is, like you say, an incredible system setter on the PSP's, amazing production values.
And yeah, the Ashley Wood animated cut scenes, really, really strong. This is a great pick. Maybe I should have picked this instead of Chains of Olympus, because there is nothing else quite like it, quite as good.
Well, I respect it, Darran, it's good.
You know, I just thought, again, it was gonna be one of those things, because you do put a lot of thought into these lists, and I just felt that you'd maybe rule it off the table, because, you know, there are better ways to play it now. But, you know, if you're doing a PSP portable, portable, then you want, it feels like you want to have all the, as many heavy hitters as you can, and that to me did feel like one of the big games on the console.
Yeah, and I don't want to get too in the weeds of that. Is it available now stuff? Because we did that, we just did that too many times.
It just became, you just weren't representing the system well enough if you were going too much down that route, I think. So I agree. So I think we just, you just treat it as what matters on PSP, like what is the key thing?
I think that's how to approach it, which software matters. So what's your second pick, Darran?
So my second pick, I'm gonna go with my free pick two. I mean, theoretically, I could just say free pick one.
I know, that's how you plan these things, I get it.
And my free pick two is gonna be Metal Gear Acid 2.
Okay, well that I'm upset about because that was gonna be my next pick.
Right, I love strategy games and I love card games. So this is a no brainer for me. And again, it's one of those things where, yes, if you'd got Metal Gear 2, I could have just taken Metal Gear.
But I really do feel that this is a masterful improvement over the original game. It feels a lot more assured. There's a lot more nuance to its combat mechanics.
And one of the things that I really enjoyed about it is that as great as Acid was in terms of like, it's got this batshit crazy story and it just thematically works really well with the integration of the cards into the actual game world. It feels, even though it was obviously very odd when it was first announced, it feels like it has all the core aspects of Metal Gear fused into it. And, but one of the things that I did find with Acid is it did have lots of little niggly things I didn't like.
And with the sequel, it felt like Kojima had like stealthily crept into my brain, possibly with a cardboard box, who knows, and extracted all my issues that I had and said, right, Darran's really upset about this. So let's fix him for Metal Gear Acid 2. And he did.
I mean, it's got a really engaging story at its heart. I feel the story is a lot better than the first one. The cards still work really well.
And it makes, they make perfect sense, the way they mesh into the game's world. Everything has been generally sped up and streamlined. So there's less downtime when you're playing it.
The perf box that comes with it does feel completely unnecessarily. And the only, I think the only real issue with the game is that for some reason, it's never made the leap to other consoles. Like it felt like it would have been perfect to do a Metal Gear Acid double pack on like the, on PS3 or even PS4 and we've never had it.
So hopefully my pretty small PlayStation will change that.
Yeah, I mean, this is a great game. And I remember you making the case in the office several times, like why the fuck haven't they just put this on XBLA or PSN?
Yeah.
Because it's so true and especially Switch. This would be so perfect on Switch. But again, I think because this happened before this sort of like Fire Emblem XCOM renaissance of interest in turn-based games happened, which feels like it happened just a few years down the line from this, like in the early 2010s.
It just means this didn't feel like it was in vogue at the time. People just weren't up for it. Also, I think because this released before they'd done that full fat Metal Gear experience, first in Portable Ops and then in Peace Walker, I just don't think there was enthusiasm for this.
And yeah, like you say, this is much improved over the first one. The first one is perfectly okay, but because it has the sort of like, mimics the PS2, PS1 Metal Gear aesthetic, it just doesn't pop off the screen in the way the second one does with the revamped visual style and the slightly more out there storyline because it's firmly in like alternate universe Metal Gear stuff basically. I think all of that combined with the, you know, like the increased amount of cards, just yeah, makes it a true classic.
This is a great pick. And I would say that, you know, like if there are any, any sort of like older boys in your life who can sort you out with this on Steam Deck, I've heard it looks amazing on Steam Deck because you can blow up the 3D graphics and stuff. So...
Oh, wow. Yeah, I could, I could well imagine. I mean, to be fair, Konami does seem to be in an era at the moment where it's releasing a lot of retro.
Yeah.
So hopefully they're listening to this podcast and they're like, you know what? We did the Karabunga collection. We did the Contra collection.
Yeah, let's bring Metal Gear Acid 1 and 2 back on Switch.
Yeah, these are ripe to be rediscovered. These are very like card games and fucking turn-based games. It's never been a hotter time for them, but it was not a hot time for them in 2005, 2006.
So yeah, I think a lot of people played that first Metal Gear Acid and no one played the second one, but it is a real classic and it's perfect for PSP. It's a great pick, Darran. I think there's a possibility you've won it with that one-two punch, but we'll see how it goes.
Long way to go, I guess. So my next pick then, I'm gonna take category eight music-based game. I'm gonna take Lumines.
This is an interesting one in the sense that you can play Lumines on other systems, but everyone seems to agree this first one is the one. Like the choice of music. It's basically a block-dropping, block-matching game, but there is essentially a bar running alongside, that kind of like, basically like your score is validated as the bar goes past and then what you've kind of like, the amount of blocks you've kind of matched it, essentially you will score at that point and then the music will change in time with the game as you play.
And so music is a really key part of it as it is with all of Mizoguchi's games. This is like PSP as fuck this game. It just, the way it looks, the way it feels, the amazing sound.
It was one of the launch era, launch window games that really defined the system. There are definitely other cool music based games on the system. I did think a bit about Patabond for this category, for example, which are great games.
I might pick them elsewhere. I guess we'll see. There's three of them on the system though.
So maybe not quite as urgent to get off the board. Luminase though, fantastic. The music is just so iconic.
There is a really lovely version of this you can play on Switch these days, which I believe is only remakes the first game, only re-releases the first game. What do you think, Darran, of this as a pick?
Yeah, I was right. This was a launch game. So it would have been one of the ones that I picked up.
When I got my Japanese copy. And yeah, this is what I wanted. There is Luminous 2, but it doesn't feel like enough of an iteration like Metal Gear Asset 2 was over.
So yeah, you picked a really good one here. And yeah, it just, again, like you said, it really highlighted that screen. And it looked amazing, it sounded amazing.
The actual way, the fusion of obviously the puzzling with the music drops works really well. Yeah, I mean, it's a fantastic game. And I've got a lot of time for it.
And yes, yeah, it's in my, I mean, I've largely picked stuff which I've still got in my collection, cause it's like, well, if it's in my collection, it must be good enough to go on a PSP portable. And yeah, this is in my collection, but sadly it won't be on my little PSP.
Yeah, some of the music choices I made in the second Luminaire seemed to be a bit contentious. Whereas I think everyone fondly remembers the music here. It's that thing as well where I think it's like a really good puzzle game rather than like an all-timer puzzle game, but the music element just elevates it to that all-timer status, I think.
So, which is, you know, sometimes the case with Mizoguchi's games. So yeah, yeah, glad to hear it, Darran. What's your third pick?
Right, so my third pick, I'm going for Perfect for PSP, and I'm going to take Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.
Interesting.
So I'm going for this because you have to have a Monster Hunter game on your PSP. It was like, it didn't, this was the one where it did kind of come of age in the West. Like, it still didn't have that mass popularity of like, what world would go on to have.
But I remember at the time, reading in every week, we used to get an industry magazine come through. I can't remember what it was called now. Yes, MCV.
And I can remember that Capcom were pushing the shit out of this in terms of like the connectivity. Because apparently in Japan, it was a really big thing that everybody would like get together at various locations and they'd all get together to play the game. Whereas obviously we tend to, in the West, it seemed like we were more embracing the online side of gaming rather than the social side of like local couch play as it's called today.
But yeah, this was an absolutely ridiculous time sink for me. And while I didn't clock up as many hours on it as some of my friends, like I think Luke Halberge spent an insane amount of time on this. It took up a large point of my life.
And the reason why I feel it's perfect for PSP is it does that whole thing where it is a game which is largely built around playing for, you do your little short mission like with Metal Gear Peace Walker, and you're constantly improving your runs. And when you're first starting off, the monsters are ridiculously tough and you won't get very far in it. I mean, I was at one point thinking maybe I could get away with this as an RPG pick because I really don't like RPGs, but it's effectively just a reject version of Monster Hunter Freedom 2.
So if you'd chosen this, I was gonna go for that so I could get a Monster Hunter game. But it obviously introduces numerous new elements. Like you've got the FeyLine Comrade system.
So if you don't wanna team up with other people, you can obviously have one of the little cute cats to help you when you prefer playing solo. They just introduce loads of quality of life improvements over Freedom 2. There's several new monsters to battle.
You've got a crazy number of new materials so you can make new weapons. There's a staggering number of quests to it. And that's before you can even consider the DLC ones, which are free, because I'm guessing that because this is kind of like the ultimate PSP console, you'd have all the DLC as like standard with it.
Okay, that's cool. So yeah, so while I... This is kind of like one of those retroactive things where kind of like Yakuza.
Yakuza wasn't big at the time when it first came out on PS2 and stuff now, but it's so fucking huge now that you'd be like, oh yeah, yeah, what? Oh, there was a Monster Hunter on PSP? Oh yeah, I'll have some of that.
So that's what I'm hoping for. But I do think it's like one of the premier titles for me because I just, along with This and Everybody's Golf 2, which was my other choice, I've sunk so much time into both of those games on the system.
Yeah, I mean, do you know what? I was not even on my radar to pick a Monster Hunter game. It's just not a series I know or understand.
I will try and rectify that with the new one that's coming out. But I will confess to it, just it passing me by, one of my many games, Journalism Crimes, was reviewing Monster Hunter Freedom 2 and giving it like 67% in play after playing it for probably about five or six hours. Just not something I understood or got to grips with.
I think the thing is that I remember people bringing their DSs into the office, Darran, but I don't really remember there being much of a scene of PSPs in the Imagine office. Like it was past a certain point, I just don't recall there being that much of it. But I mean, maybe it just happened on the download and I was kind of missing it.
But Monster Hunter, I just missed as a craze. However, you are right in that this is perfect for PSP. It literally sold the system in Japan when they, arguably one of the weaknesses of the Vita is that they didn't have it.
They moved it to 3DS. So, you know, that's tough. That was tough for Sony that that happened.
Yeah, yeah, great pick. And yeah, I'll let you have the DLC. It's all yours, pal.
So, yeah. Okay, good stuff. What's our pick next then?
Guess I'll take my perfect for PSP. I'm gonna take LocoRoco 2. So, the interesting thing here is you could take the original LocoRoco, but the second one really is just the first game, but with more variety to it and slightly more going on outside of the main game with a little house building element of the little blue lads, the wee wee boys, whatever they're called.
So, yeah, I love the original LocoRoco. Again, when we're talking about perfect for the system, this is a platform entirely controlled with the shoulder buttons. And the shoulder buttons and the PSP were lovely things, just like one on each side, just these clear handles that you just push down.
And it just felt really, really nice. And this was a game that basically you tilted the entire world of the game using those shoulder buttons. And the first time I experienced that on a PSP was the first time I had that kind of moment of like, oh, they get this, they actually get what this system is and what it can do and how its interface differs.
And why, you know, there's a reason that this is on PSP and not on PS2, it makes perfect sense here. That combined with the very simple kind of like cutout art style, but very like cute little blob guys rolling around these, it's like a simple but elegant art style that works really, really well. And so LocoRoco 2 has more going on to it in terms of variety.
So I guess could take the first one, maybe more people played the first one, I'm not really sure, but second one's a more complete experience. But in general, I think you gotta have a LocoRoco game to really explain the PSP experience and how the different ways in which some devs really got their like claws into it in terms of understanding what it could do. What do you think about this one, Darran?
Yeah, so I'm still kind of torn about whether to use it as like my music based choice. But I mean, you're quite right, it is largely, it's a platformer, it's just got like musical elements really. But I actually completed it fully during lockdown.
And because I was kind of like, PSP games were still relatively cheap in that I could like fill in some of my missing gaps. And I really loved LocoRoco. And so I picked up the second one.
And you're right, they are sure. But it's a really solid experience. And in some ways, it kind of reminds me of what Annapurna do now.
I don't know a lot about Annapurna. But I picked up its recent, they did that ostentatious Switch compilation with loads of their games on.
Oh, yeah, sold out, didn't it?
Yeah, so I picked that up for a small fortune recently. And one of the things that I've often used to see as a negative was that the actual games, a lot of the games on it, are really, really short. But what they offer is this kind of like visual overload.
And it's kind of selling you not as just like a game, but as an experience. And I really think like with the LocoRoco games, that how you approach those, they've got this really great way of like immersing you into what you're doing. And like you said, because the controls are just literally, you're just using the shoulder buttons.
You don't need to really think about anything and you can just enjoy this like all this visual piece popping out at you as you roll through everything.
Yeah, and you know, you're right to highlight the music. The music is incredible in these games. Just the little sort of like blob lads singing along and stuff.
It's just, yeah, just such a specific vibe. And again, like weighed up pat upon for this category as well. I assume you take one of those to the music based categories, Daz.
But that's the tricky thing with both this and Pat upon actually is deciding which one to take. Because I think LocoRoco 2, because it has like quite a lot of stuff to unlock as well. So it's like it does have more variety.
I think it is the right one to pick of the two. Pat upon between like two and three has completely different sort of behind the scenes systems going on. And it's quite complex games.
It is tricky to pick one based on that, I think. So yeah, LocoRoco 2 is what I ended up with overall. What's your next pick, Darran?
So I'm going to go with racing slash sports game. And I'm going to go with Wipeout Pure.
Fuck! That was my pick too.
And again, before you said about the not worrying too much about whether you can play it elsewhere, I was thinking that well, the Wipeout HD collection on PS3 kind of makes both these games pointless, but you can't fit a PS3 in your pocket. So I don't know. This to me was like this and Ridge Racer were like one of the big reasons why I wanted to get one.
And I remember we interviewed developers of the early Ridge Racer games. And they said that one of the reasons why they always strive to get a Ridge Racer game on a system at launch was because they felt like racing games were a great way of showing off the strength and power of a console. And I think Wipeout Pure is one of the games on release which highlighted just how good this was.
You look at this compared to anything on the DS. And if you were as boring enough to just chew sheer graphical grunt over performance when you're choosing a handheld, this was the kind of thing that helped sell it. And I love the fact that the Zone Mode, which was obviously first in Fusion, had come back to it.
It's got some genuinely excellent track design. But one of the things for me was there was so much good downloadable content for it.
And it was like free.
It was kind of like before publishers realized that they could make money out of that side of it. And it was all given away free. I'm not sure if that was to do with the fact that there were a few launch issues or something.
Yeah, I just think this highlights, again, if you're going to have a PSP, you've got to have, it feels like you've got to have a wipeout game. And I think, well, I guess you could make an argument that Pulse is probably slightly better because it's obviously the later game. This is the one that really made an impression on me at the time.
And it just feels like there's an unwritten law that you have to have it and that would have been etched onto a stone tablet if Sony was around during biblical times. It's like, it's a really fucking good game.
Yeah, it's a proper sort of like system seller to just see it in action. It's just an amazing technical showcase even now. You would look at it and think it could be the PS Vita version of the game.
It's just so crisp and the tracks look really nice. And even though there's some flat 3D visuals in the PSP's back catalog more generally, not in this game. They're just so, the color palette is so well chosen and the lighting effects look so nice.
Yeah, it's a full fat WIPA experience on a handheld. Really impressive. And so yeah, it's sort of like I've got Pure Opulse written down for this category, but I might go a different direction with it instead.
So yeah, good pick, Darran. And I think for a lot of people, this was their first touch point with, look how fucking good this screen is. So yeah, good choice.
Right then, what do I take next? I'm going to take, this is a bit unusual. This might seem like a left field pick, but I think there's nothing else quite like it on the system.
For category 4 RPG, I'm going to take Jean Dayarc.
Oh, you bastard!
Yes, that's what I wanted to hear. So you're familiar with this game then, Darran?
You've taken my choice, Samuel. This is outrageous.
Yeah, so this was, PSP was great for importing games, obviously because it was region free. I remember my local shopping gospel had this in. I was anticipating it for such a long time because there was this hot moment where obviously Level 5 was making Professor Layton, they'd made Dragon Quest VIII on PS2 as well, Rogue Galaxy, Dark Chronicle.
Their cache was quite high. And then here was this turn-based tactical, strategic RPG with cell-shaded graphics based on French history, essentially, like a fantastical version of French history, that looked really, really tasty. Came out of Japan.
They did bring it to North America, but chose not to bring it to Europe, which broke my heart at the time. I thought PSP was kind of... There was like a window where they were lacking for RPGs.
They got a whole bunch of them eventually, but it took a bit of time. And then to not bring this out in Europe was a bit outrageous. But this is a really nicely made, like high production value, great RPG.
And again, like it's a genre that was not necessarily like the hottest thing at the time. But this is a great example of the form. So still really, really good.
Still looks really, really nice. And hasn't been released anywhere else. And again, like the French element of it does give it a slightly different flavor, I think, to any other RPG on the system.
It's not quite the same kind of thing as like a Square Enix game or what have you. And yeah, so just something, again, that was perfect for PSP and just was some like RPG masters really sort of like showing what they could do at the time. Feels like the right pick.
And if you were going to try to attract someone to, I guess, like a, you know, like a re-release of the PSP or something, this would be one of the games you'd pick, I think. What do you think, Darran?
Well, like I said, I think you're a bastard, Samuel.
Well, that's well documented on this podcast, so that's fine.
So no, I completely agree with you. And so I have this really weird thing where I don't really like turn-based RPGs like Final Fantasy, but I do like turn-based strategy RPGs. And so I love Fire Emblem.
And yeah, the thing that stood out for me was that it does feel so different from pretty much everything else on the system. I think the closest you could probably get is Riviera, which is also an interesting take, but I think that also came out on GBA. So it's more of like a straightforward port.
But yeah, one of the interesting things with it is it doesn't really do anything new. So it's still riffing on the same rock, scissors, paper approach that Fire Emblem has been using since the NES days. And obviously some powers are more effective than others against, and you've got this like triangle.
But it's so polished, like you said. The actual core mechanics of it are just really, really strong. There's loads of interesting characters.
Yeah, and you genuinely care about the characters. It looks great, as you mentioned. And again, I always kind of like stuff which feels a bit different.
And the fact that it's obviously set in this alternate version of France and you've got like all these demons about and stuff is really good. Going back to what you were saying about Europe, the only thing I could possibly think of is that it did, and it might be my memory misremembering this because it has been a while since I played it, but it did feel like there were quite a lot of French slurs in it. And that's maybe why maybe they thought it wouldn't work in Europe.
But yeah, I think it's amazing. Like I said, this was my heart pick, and I'll probably now have to choose a game which I not play, but I know it's good.
I hadn't really considered the French slur aspect. That's a possibility. They have this thing with the voice acting where it's English, but it's French-accented English basically, and then I think there are some French actors in there as well.
It also does that thing that I love when Japanese RPGs do this of having anime cutscenes as well, just to make it feel like the production values are a little bit higher. So yeah, quite a lot of story in this, and I do think if it was excavated in any form, probably Switch is the best location for it. It would be much loved, and I think the people who did discover it on PSP really loved it.
So yeah, I'm pleased. After losing Wipeout, I was a little bit bummed out, so I'm pleased to hear this has taken a piece off of you, Darran. That makes me happy.
Yeah, I do. Well, LocoRoco, too, as well. That's a great choice.
There's nothing else like this one, is there? It's like a one-off. That's the thing.
I guess FF Tactics, War of the Lions, probably as close as you, other than Riviera, like you mentioned. But anyway, what's your next pick, Darran?
So I'm surprised this has been floating around for so long, so I feel that I've got to take it. So I'm going for the Rockstar Games category, and I'm going for GTA Vice City Stories. And the reason, to clarify, I'm not really a huge fan of GTA games.
I've not even played GTA V. In fact, I've got an unrunning bet that I'll never play it.
How are you going to win that bet? How are you going to win that bet, when you die?
Well, apparently when the guy dies, they're going to hand me the tenner then. But I always like the ambition of GTA games. But I guess because I spent so much of my youth playing Japanese import games from the age of 15, I've always really loved tight gameplay mechanics over anything else.
And I always find the GTA games to be a bit like fumbling and stuff with the way they implement stuff. Having said that, I do think both... Well, I think all three GTA games on PSP are brilliant.
And if it wasn't for the fact that Chinatown Wars was so clearly designed for the DS, I would have picked that because the story is excellent. The actual drug minigame in it is absolutely phenomenally good. And that was a real time sink for me on the DS.
But I'm going for Vice City Stories for no other reason than I really did enjoy the original. And obviously you're carrying on with one of the characters that's from that game. And because it obviously came after Liberty City Stories, it just feels that little bit more tightened up and polished.
Yeah, it does a couple of things that Liberty City Stories doesn't do. It has some helicopters in it. I think aircraft more generally you can control.
You couldn't do that in the other PSP one for Liberty City. So that's one way it changes. It's got Phil Collins in it, like actually Phil Collins.
They even made the Rockstar colorful 80s art for Phil Collins, which is great. I want to have that. They should sell that in the Rockstar store.
And then I'll have that framed. Just GTA Vice City Stories, Phil Collins. That'd be good.
I think it has Easy Lover on the soundtrack as well, which is an absolute banger, obviously. I think it's a good pick. Honestly, I think Rockstar made six or seven Rockstar games on PSP.
And there's such a strong mix of ports and, yeah, like bespoke versions of different series on there. It's really, really strong. And so, yeah, I think Chinatown Wars would have been a great pick, Darran, because it looks totally different to the DS one.
It has a completely different art style, but I also understand it's more closely linked with the DS as a DS-specific experience. I think it did come up in the DS draft, so I understand that makes sense.
It loses a little bit as well because you don't get, like, you're not doing the tap, tap, tap in, and the way you're manipulating the stuff doesn't feel, it does feel a little shoe-horned in, where it felt obviously a lot more natural on the DS. And obviously Vice City has got, like, as you said, it's got a banging soundtrack. It's from one of my favorite eras, so I think I was always, hopefully, going to choose this over Liberty City.
However, I do have a lot more fun memories, like I mentioned earlier about, we did use, there was three of us, and we all used to play Liberty City Stories at lunchtime on the multiplayer, because it was just so much fun. But going back to what we were saying earlier, there are so many similar games on the PSP that even if Vice City is gone, there's two perfectly great GTA alternatives on it.
And The Warriors, a great port of The Warriors.
Yeah, The Warriors.
Yeah, it's just the full game of The Warriors is exactly the same as the PS2 one. Just really, really good.
Sorry, one of the other things I was going to mention as well is that going back to that whole PS2 experiences in the palm of your hand, they were all ported to PS2.
Yeah, it's true. And then when they did, I think people were a bit like, I've played this before, kind of critical vibes about it. People weren't quite as into it.
But yeah, that's why they were so perfect for the PSP. Because the novelty of having Vice sit in your hands in 06 or 07 or whenever this came out, I can't remember which year it was. Really, really impressive.
So yeah, makes total sense to me. Okay, great choice, Darran. Next up then, I'm going to take my free pick number, category number nine, free pick one.
I'm going to take Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. So I doubt you would have picked this, Darran, because I know these games are not necessarily your wheelhouse. But if we're talking about games that were ambitious for the PSP's capabilities, this was really up there.
This was essentially the third full Kingdom Hearts game. It was this kind of era of slightly odd spin-offs. The difference with this one is that as well as having an original story, it had original worlds in it as well that you hadn't seen in the spin-offs to that point.
They tended to just take the levels that were already in Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 and kind of like blow them out. This has some slightly different settings. It took you to Lilo and Stitch, basically.
It took you to Sleeping Beauty. I think they also took you to the Disney Castle area as well, which might have been in the other games, but here was represented a little bit differently. It's a prequel to the other Kingdom Hearts games.
What they did that was a bit different is they have three different storylines you play through, each tied to these different characters. Then you would go to the same worlds, but their stories would be different, but they'd occasionally cross over or you'd meet different characters that appear in the different ones. It was like a full-fat Kingdom Hearts game in the palm of your hands, this sort of third-person action RPG.
It was really, really strong, had its own great Yoko Shimomura soundtrack, a couple of other composers involved as well. Had your classic cameos chucked in from both Disney and Square Enix side. You get a bit of Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII and Crysis Core in this game.
Really, really strong. Ended up being quite a pivotal part of the overall Kingdom Hearts story, which I won't lie, I did get a bit lost in. I didn't finish all three storylines of these characters.
I did do the Terra and Aqua storylines in this. Really strong. Guessing Kingdom Hearts is not really your sort of area, Darran, but this was a pretty big blockbuster deal for the PSP.
Any thoughts on this?
I don't have too many thoughts because, yeah, you're quite right. It's not a game I've played. I did get quite into the first Kingdom Hearts.
And that was largely because my daughter at the time, she obviously wasn't very old at all, and she was absolutely obsessed with the launch trailer. So I ended up getting the game at the time. Because when you were playing the God of War games all through, I was doing the same thing by complete accident.
And after I finished all of those, there's this Kingdom Hearts collection on PS4, which has kind of got everything. And then it's got, I think, the story versions of the 3DS game and the PSP game. And I completed the first one, and I just stopped because I didn't know what the fuck was going on.
I found it very confusing. And while I loved the Disney side of it, again, I've never been a big RPG fan, so the Square side of it never really done much for me. And yeah, it's one of those ones that I don't really have much knowledge of outside of the GBA game, which I quite like, because again, it had card elements in it and the original.
So yeah, I trust you when you say this is a really good game.
Yeah, it doesn't make sense on PS4. I've played the HD version of this, and it's nice that they excavated it, but it was made for PSP and it feels PSP scale. It's not quite as good as Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2, I'd say.
The cool thing about the story is that you are basically... I think the whole thing with it is that your mentor in the game is basically the villain as well, and so your characters all come back together at the end to fight him in this massive post-apocalyptic graveyard of all these different... I mean, again, it sounds silly because it's Kingdom Hearts Keyblades basically all stuck in the ground, and it's like they're wearing this rad armor and they're all fighting their mentor at the end.
I think that's what happens. It's just quite interesting, even though it definitely contributes to the overall lore messiness that becomes the overall issue with the Kingdom Hearts series. But yeah, I think it's more picking it to just say, again, this was someone doing something shit hot with the PSP's capabilities.
2010, so quite late for a PSP game. And there it is, Darran, that's Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. So what's your next pick?
It's getting tricky now, actually. Do you know something? I'm going to go for a music-based game.
Yeah.
And I'm going to... I do really want LocoRoco on my system.
Yeah.
But I do really love this game, and I just don't think... I think it's the kind of game you're not going to think that I'd pick. Okay.
So I'm going for Rock Band Unplugged.
This was a great game, and I did think about this.
So, you know, Harmonix were like... they were obviously masters of the rhythm action genre at that point. And what was interesting about the PSP version compared to the DS-like music games that came out is that there were all those crazy add-ons wasn't there for the DS.
So they tried to make it like a mini version of the Qatar. And the PSP wasn't having any of that. It was like, no, we're just doing a proper fucking music game.
And they obviously... Harmonix basically took all the elements of amplitude, which I absolutely adore. And there's obviously a little bit of frequency in there as well.
So it's got the same frenetic butt impression of those games. You've got a really good strong mix of core songs. I think they were all licensed at the time.
There's just over 40. And there was loads of downloadable ones. Again, I think you had about 50, and I've probably got about 20 of them on my PSP still.
And yeah, I did like the idea of Luminous, but I thought it was going to get taken off the table. And I still wasn't too sure if I could get away with LocoRoco as a music game. But I've always been really impressed with how well the original amplitude used to fuse the different harmonies of the tracks together.
So you could be just playing along to the drum beat, and then all of a sudden the song will just kick in on the chorus, because that's where you've activated it. And I think if you have this, even though it probably doesn't feel as obvious a pick, there's more than enough strong tunes on it, which I think would appeal to a casual audience.
Oh yeah, this was really good. It's a little bit forgotten, isn't it? Because there were so many music games at that time, and this was just one of many.
It was the one that didn't have any kind of plastic instrument stuff attached to it, so easy to ignore. But I did have this, and I thought it was really, really good. Some great music on the bass game.
You've got, basically, You're Living on a Prayer by Bon Jovi, You're Mr. Brightside by The Killers, a millennial kind of classic, Pimble Wizard by The Who, What's My Age Again by Blink 182, White Wedding, Billy Idol. All these songs would have cost them an absolute fortune to license, so they really went for it. Yeah, so I think this is a great pick.
Really nice production values, and you're right. It connects this series back to its lineage on PS2 with frequency and amplitude. So I think this is really strong, Darran.
And yeah, I didn't think you would pick it, but I also think it's a good choice. The other thing I was going to say is I had two other choices for this category. Everyday Shooter, which was ported from PS3, and it's a really, really...
That's a great sort of like twin stick, not PSP obviously, but twin stick shooter with the music plays in time to what you're doing on screen by Jessica Mack. That game, really, really good. And Guitario Man Lives as well, which I thought of out for both this category and port remake or compilation.
Guitario Man, a great game. This is the only system it was ported to after PS2, I believe. So PSP would have been good for that too.
But unfortunately, there's a lot of other things competing in that port remake or compilation category. But a good pick, Darran.
Yeah, it's one of those things that now you've just easily strung off a load of games and you realize that, yeah, music based games, that was a good category to choose.
And Patapon. Yeah, Patapon's fucking amazing, but I don't know if I've got space for it.
Patapon was on my list as well.
Yeah, that's like an amazing, again, that's an amazing use of what the PSP can do. Just face buttons, tapping them in time to the music, really, really good. Yeah, it's...
And there were three of them, weren't there, on PSP?
Yeah, and all a little bit different from each other, despite using the same basic interactions. But I don't know, I don't think I've got space to pick it now. I've got other stuff I need to grab.
So, yeah, I kind of saw it as I was either going to take LocoRoco or Patapon for perfect for PSP, and yeah, unfortunately Patapon might lose out here.
But I do feel bad about it. They've got similar, even though they're obviously different types of games, they've got a kind of like shared DNA, if that makes sense.
Absolutely, yeah. Yeah, so it should be... Yeah, it's a tricky one, but I do want the listeners to know, I recognize Patapon.
Wasn't it given away free when there was that PlayStation hack?
You might be right, because I was trying to think how I first encountered it. So remember, this is on our radar, because we knew it was from the same people as LocoRoco, basically it was that Japan studio and the aesthetics kind of similar. But yeah, I think you might be right.
I only remember the PS3 games I got out of that, which was Dead Nation and Infamous, I think it was, the original Infamous. But yeah, I think you might be right. All right, my next pick then.
Right, I'm going to take my second free pick, so category 10. I'm going to take Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII. So again, sort of like getting my Square Enix stuff ticked off here, which won't be a surprise to any of the listeners of this podcast.
This game I think could have gone for console level Blockbuster 2, because it's a prequel storyline about the character Zack Fair in the Final Fantasy VII universe, who is essentially the character whose life cloud, spoiler alert, basically steals in order to forge his identity when he emerges at the start of Final Fantasy VII. That is all covered in the base game, but you don't get that in the original game, but you don't get that much Zack in there. He's a pretty minor character.
This basically tells the story as a kind of like doomed puppet of Shinra, and it's nicely done because it has really well developed romance between him and Aerith in the game. So you get a good slice of like Zack in Midgar, and then the structure of the game is him being dispatched on all these different missions on behalf of Shinra basically. And so as this kind of like story of Sephiroth's downfall plays out, it's really nicely magnified in this game.
It's a really iconic moment in FF7, but here they blow out in this really cool way. They explain how like Cloud comes to be part of it, and then it all leads up to this extremely devastating ending where Zack is basically shot dead on this cliff outside Midgar before he can get back to Aerith. A very, very sad ending.
Quite cheesily rendered, as you might expect, with the music and the anime-style presentation of it. But this really, as someone playing this, when I was like 19 playing this, it just really knocked my socks off. I was like, wow, I can't believe they've made something this legitimate in the Final Fantasy series on PSP.
So yeah, in it goes. Honestly, this probably should have been my number one pick in terms of my personal preferences. I kind of expected you wouldn't pick it though, Darran, so I felt like it was pretty safe to put it here.
It has obviously been put on modern systems now finally, and plays a really key part in the recent Final Fantasy Remake series too. Any thoughts on this one?
I have no thoughts.
It is like Matthew's here.
I really do not like Final Fantasy VII. I just, I never understood it, I guess. I managed to, I thought it was really incredibly impressive at the time, and I did buy it.
And I managed to get to, I think, where Cloud dresses up as a woman to get into somewhere. But it just never grabbed me. And I love Final Fantasy VIII.
I think that is really cool, and I know that that is generally considered to be not as good as VII. So because, even though this did look amazing at the time, and even though there was obviously loads of hype in the office, my kind of disinterest in Final Fantasy VII just put me off this, because I just assumed it was going to be like a remake of a game which I wasn't going to enjoy. And as it turns out, I was clearly very wrong about that.
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting to hear your journey with it. So, yeah, all these RPGs have felt relatively safe, but I'm glad I grabbed Jean d'Arc before I grabbed these ones, because that seemed like there was the right order to do those in. So that's good.
What's your next pick, Darran?
Right. This will be a fairly short one, but I'll go for Console Cousin Blockbuster. And as I mentioned before, I'll go for Ghost of Sparta.
And the reason I'm going to go for it is because I'm all about the razzle-dazzle. And while Ghost of Sparta is in some ways, like you said, probably not as strong as Chains of Olympus, it's far, far, far better on the sheer scale of how it's pushing stuff. One of the things I noticed with it, because I actually sold my copies of both God of War games on PSP during my playthroughs of the God of War games, because they felt a little too constrained on the system.
I ended up picking up the PS3 ports, which I think they were by Ready at Dawn as well. You obviously picked Chains of Olympus, which was a fantastic showcase of what the PSP was capable of, but you can't really go wrong with either of them. One of the things that I do like about the God of War games, and I think it's particularly true with Sparta, is that even though his adventures are shrunk down onto that tiny screen, they don't lose that sense of impact.
Because like you said, they've got the same sense of scale and the set pieces aren't as dramatic, but you still really feel like you're on a one-man mission to take down these impossible things and you're able to do it. And I actually enjoyed it a lot more playing it on the PS3 because while the graphics obviously do look a little simplified, being upscale to those higher resolutions, you do understand just how technically impressive it was for a PSP game. And isn't Sparta the one with that really cool minigame where you've got to push your child away?
No, you're thinking of... that is Trains of Olympus.
That's the best part of that game because you've got all those crass sex minigames in the other ones and you've got... See, that's my memory. I literally thought that was in Ghost of Sparta.
No, this is the one where you... Don't you drown Atlantis, basically. That's what happens in this game, right?
It kind of gets... It goes under water. You cause the drowning of Atlantis to fall into the sea and then the whole game is basically about that.
I think that's what happens in this one.
Yeah. I just really thought the Pushing the Girl minigame was in this one. And I've obviously...
See, this is what happens when you play two very similar looking games, back to back.
Yeah, it does happen that way and I didn't have as much affection for this, but it maybe even goes a bit further with the big set pieces than Chains of Olympus does. But yeah, that daughter stuff is kind of what sets that one apart, I think. That's why I picked it.
But yeah, this is still pretty good. I mean, it's still very visually impressive. I also say as well, the HD editions are good.
I think playing this blown up with a PSP emulator or so an older boy tells me, that's actually a really great way to experience these games because you can just do resolutions a PSP could never do, but you can still see it on a handheld and that feels like the right way to enjoy it to me. But yes, again, an older boy told me that.
Yeah, I've experienced it by playing on a PS3. So I think the default scaling is 720p. And then because I'm a massive nerd, I've used a Retro Tink 4K, which then can scale the image up properly to like 4K.
So yeah, the textures do obviously look like a bit flat and washed out. But yeah, it's great. And again, you just get a better sense of how impressive they are mechanically.
But again, they've lost none of that sense of scale. One of the cool things about the original God of War is when you've got that... So, we're going to start that sequence with the big titan, and the way the camera does these dizzy and pull backs, and that's still on the PSP.
And they're not obviously to the same degree, but they're still mightily impressive, and it does feel like these were good potential ways of showcasing what this machine could do.
In which case, which category was that you picked?
That was the same category you had for Console Cousin Blockbusters.
Yes. Yes, category two, right, that makes sense. Cool, okay.
It comes back to me then. Right then, let's take this really tricky category seven racing or sports game, because I agree it doesn't really make sense to take Wipeout Pulse. I think Pure actually has slightly better track design overall as well, if I recall.
And again, it's that thing of like the first impression of it was kind of the magic of it, and then Pulse felt like it came and went a little bit more. I'm gonna take everybody's tennis portable. So there's a lot of like different sports and racing games on here.
I did think about Out Run 2006 on here. I did have that, and it was very impressive how they managed to shrink that down. But tennis, it's like perfect about having tennis in your hands, and it was another great thing about, another great breakthrough of the PSP is having that 3D tennis game experience in your hands.
Virtual tennis is really good on here. I think playing this, playing them side by side now, I slightly prefer this, so it's a spin-off of the Everybody's Golf series, or the Hot Shots Golf if you're in America. But it's just a really fun, vibrant, beautiful looking tennis game.
Plays really well now, and this series, I think, has stood the test of time. People still really enjoy these. And yeah, this is a great, maybe slightly underplayed tennis experience on here, but again, the art style maybe just matches what the PSP's capabilities are really well.
Really fun, easy to pick up and play, but quite a high skill ceiling to it. I don't know if you've ever played this one, Darran?
I've played it a little bit, partly because I really did enjoy the Everybody Golf games on PSP. So when this came along, I had my interest. I was more of a virtual tennis player at the time, but I do think you're right.
This has just aged better because obviously, there's no licenses to worry about, no tennis players who are no longer around. It's mechanically really solid. I mean, for all their cartoony looks, the Everybody Golf games were always excellent.
And again, it's got that same pick up and play that the Everybody Golf series has got. So yeah, I think it's really good. And I'm kind of going to lose out because I'm not going to pick Everybody's Golf for my other first pick.
So I'm not going to have any sports games at all. And I do feel like in terms of genres, a sports category is a good thing to have.
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, the other barrier I had with Virtual Tennis, right, is I've been playing, listeners will know this, the Dreamcast. We did a Dreamcast episode recently.
And I can't get out of my head just how superior those Dreamcast Virtual Tennis games are. And then anything else that comes after that, that's not necessarily built for the arcades first, it doesn't quite have the same magic to me. So that's something I just can't get out of my head is the incredible presentation of those Dreamcast games and comparing them to any other game in the series.
It's quite tricky. So yeah. Okay, cool.
What's your next pick, Darran?
So I'm going to go with RPG. Yeah, I'm not going to go with Jeanne d'Arc because it's off the table. So so part of me to appeal to like the masses.
Yeah, it feels like the most sense to do is to go with Persona 3 because Persona is like obviously huge now, but I'm not going to do that. And I'm actually going to go for Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions. I guess you can make the argument that this could be like in the port category because there's obviously a bit of flexibility.
But again, it's a strategy RPG. I love them. Although I always found it hard to get into the traditional Final Fantasy RPGs, I've always enjoyed quite a lot of their spin-offs.
And I think this is really strong in that obviously there's a bunch of character classes. The actual maps are really, really well designed. And I kind of got into this off the strength of Final Fantasy Tactics on GBA, which I sunk hundreds of hours into.
And I think they changed the graphics slightly on this one, which didn't go down as well when it came out. And I do think it did feel like a few people weren't as hot on it at the time because it was kind of like a remake rather than a brand new game. But I think they did enough to basically make you want to go back to it if you have played the original.
One of the other things for me as well is that when we reviewed it in the MAG, we had a really dodgy font. So it actually read like it was anal fantasy tactics, which has always made me chuckle because I'm a bit crass like that. But yeah, I think you have to have some sort of Final Fantasy presence on your PSP because there were, even though there weren't traditional Final Fantasy RPGs on it, there were obviously Final Fantasy was a big presence on it.
And so I think that seeing that my heart picks being taken off, I think probably my second most played RPG should probably get chosen over something which I know will appeal to people now because persona is so big.
Darran, I never forgot how your story about how you did your back in and played Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. It was a non-stop, like that story has stayed with me in the 11 years since we last worked together. So, yeah, yeah.
I was waiting for you to pick this one because I don't have that much experience with Final Fantasy Tactics, but this hasn't been other than like mobile. This hasn't been ported anywhere else. And so PSP is still kind of the definitive version for it.
So I think that's a really good choice. Yeah, no notes there. That's spot on.
And so yeah, I'm glad to have it represented here. I think that makes sense. Okay, next up, I'm going to take my category three, port remake or compilation, and I'm going to take Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.
And the thing is, like Darran, I weighed up Persona 3 Portable as well, but I think I've got a bit too much in that RPG sort of like area ticked off already between Crisis Core, John Day Arc and Kingdom Hearts. That's all kind of either JRPG or JRPG adjacent. So I'll take one of the things, the first things that knocked my socks off on PSP, which again, like to try and summarize the appeal of the console, it's just looking at our screen and being like, that is so close to the PS2 experience, but in my hands.
Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection was a port of Tekken 5, really comprehensive one, looked absolutely amazing. Basically just was a complete Tekken experience. I was a big lily head at the time, being a teenage boy playing this game, but it just looked fantastic.
And I think Tekken 5 generally was regarded as a bit of a return to form for the series after Tekken 4, which people didn't seem to like that much. But just a really strong version of a good fighting game on PSP. Any thoughts on this one, Darran?
Yeah, this is an excellent choice. And again, it highlights the power of the machine. There's a huge number of playable characters on it.
They obviously didn't introduce too many characters, but you had so many that I don't think that really matters. I want to say, did this get re-released on PS3 as part of a compilation?
I think it was released on PS3 as a PSN game at the start of the PS3's life cycle.
Ah, that makes sense.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, because I'm sure I played it on PS3 as well, but I can't remember. And you're now kind of highlighting as well that I'm probably not going to have any fighting games on my system either. Because there wasn't really...
One of the things I remember about the Vita is that it did have a lot of really good fighting games. And you had obviously Darkstalkers on PSP. But weirdly, Capcom never did any new Street Fighters, did they?
It was kind of like you had the Alpha 3 Max, and they never really did anything. So Namco's Tekken really stood out because it just felt so badass compared to most of the other fighters that were on the system.
Yeah.
And it didn't really have any loading issues or anything like that. It was quite a nippy game.
Yeah, for sure. It was very, very high end. Yeah, you're right.
Capcom, probably because they were preoccupied with Street Fighter 4 at the time, just didn't, yeah, it didn't really get many of those kinds of newer experiences. So yeah, quite interesting in that respect. Okay, cool.
Well, I feel pretty good about that, even though Persona 3 being on the table kind of sucks. There was a huge moment for that series and the path to Persona becoming as massively popular as it is now. But what can you do?
What's your next pick, Darran?
So I'm going to go with free pick one, even though I've obviously done free pick two. And this is probably my favourite PSP game, but I haven't picked it because I was pretty confident it wouldn't get picked.
Yeah.
But it nearly did. So I'm going with Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast.
Nice.
And, you know, yes, there's a lot of genuinely great racing games on PSP. You've got like the Ridge Racers, Burnout Legends is phenomenally good stuff. But I just think this is incredible.
And you could kind of put it in various categories, because I think you could put it in like the console blockbuster, because it does genuinely feel like it's on par with its big console cousins. And sure, the performance is not quite as good. I think you had to like overclock your PSP to get that little bit more out of it.
But it's still incredible. And I still play it now. I'll normally pop it on once a month.
And because I love the way that you can obviously you can just do a course and it takes roughly five minutes. I love the reimagined Europe and American settings of like both the original Outrun 2 and SP, which are included on it. There's a huge amount of missions to go through.
Some of them are like really well structured. It's again in that era of PlayStation, well, gaming, where there were lots of cool things to unlock rather than relying on DLC. So there's a massive number of cars.
There's a massive number of like extra music. It's got some banging tracks, some great reinterpretations. And it's just astonishing how, like when you consider the difficulties they had porting the PS2 version, because the PS2 had a significant lack of RAM compared to the Xbox original, because Xbox Outrun 2 was like obviously designed on an Xbox style Chihiro board.
And so the fact that they were able to get a really impressive port of Coast to Coast on the PS2 was really good. And then that they could go down to the PSP just felt astonishing to me. And I think if I have one criticism about the game, which I totally understand is that it was a bit sucky that you really needed to have the PS2 version in order to unlock everything because there was a few interconnected bits to it.
But I've got the PS2 version anyway. So I've got OutRun 2, I own more versions of OutRun 2 on different systems than any other game. And I really want to get the Japanese release, but it goes for about 400 quid, which just feels like too much money to own a slightly modified game of a game I own so many times anyway.
So I do realize that I'm like doubling up on racing games to a point. But I do think, again, this is an amazing showcase of just how much grunt the PSP had. And it's still timeless today.
And the fact that so many people on places like Roamark are still asking for an OutRun 3, I reckon they'll be like, oh, well, I can't get OutRun 3, but I can get this on my portable PlayStation.
Yeah, this is one of the UMDs I stole off of Nick Jones' desk in the office and just went, took home and played it when he went home on a Friday afternoon to the pub. I was like, it's going to liberate God Hand and a couple of PSP games from this pile of games. No regrets about doing that.
Yeah, super, super good. Yeah, it was just really, really sharp and just amazingly fast, considering it was on a handheld. I did think it would come up, Darran.
So yes, you've got loads of racing games and I've got none. So this is quite a contrast in our systems here. Okay, good stuff.
All right. Category six, the Rockstar Games category. I am going to take GTA Liberty City Stories.
Much like the reason you picked Wipeout Pure, it was that thing of like, I just have to pick the game that made me fall in love with the system, that blew me away. And listeners of this podcast will know that I'm a bit more GTA 3-aligned than I am Vice City-aligned. It's a bit more, because it's the first one I played and I just played it so aggressively, and I just love the kind of like weird vibes of the slightly spooky New York that Liberty City was.
This has really appealed. I think it was like, compared to the PS2 games, it's not quite as good. It doesn't quite have the same ceiling in terms of level design.
It is a world you've seen before, so in some ways, it will just never have that majesty of playing a GTA for the first time and it just blowing you away with this new location. But it's still a great representation of what the 3D GTA games did. It's a prequel story that slots into GTA III, reasonably elegantly.
It's not like a huge, hugely consequential story. But again, the slightly late 90s vibes of it are represented quite well by the radio stations. I do think that musically Vice City Stories has the edge there.
But Sony just loves Liberty City and love the idea of repeating the experience of like, here's what an open world game is for the first time with GTA III on PS2 in 2001. But having that, replicating that feeling on a PSP five years later, which is just so, so magical. Four years later, rather.
So yeah, Liberty City Stories is it does. So yeah, that kind of makes sense, doesn't it?
You've got to have a GTA game on a PSP system, I think. Because it just felt, like you said, it was such a huge deal. And I do think, and again, because of the way they are with their mission structures and they're not particularly massively long.
I do think it fared less when it was on PS2, because obviously you could see some of the flaws that weren't quite as evident on the PSP originals. But the PS2, I think, was one of the first systems to do that, because it had quite a few games that were upported. And then you kind of got a similar thing on Xbox 360 where you started getting a few handheld or digital games being upgraded.
So yeah, I think you've got to have a GTA game. And like I said, the only reason I went with Vice City is because it's 80s and I'm really old.
So we come to your last pick. Is that right, Darran?
Yeah. So I'm going to be a bit sneaky with this one. Initially, I was going to go for the Mega Drive collection, because I was just thinking, oh, you could have, you know, it's like loads of games.
I think there's like something like 30 odd games on it. And it's actually got some really good behind the scenes documentaries and stuff. But I'm actually going to go for a port.
And what I'm going to go for is Castlevania, The Dracula X Chronicles.
Good choice, yeah.
And so this is basically a remake of Rondo of Blood, which is genuinely acclaimed before Symphony of the Night came along as the definitive Castlevania experience. So it came out on PC Engine CD-ROM, and it took all the mechanics that had started to be woven into Dracula's curse on the NES. There's different pathways you can take.
There's a lot more dramatic focus on storytelling, and the PC Engine original had these astonishing, anime-styled cutscenes. And it's just a really, really good game. And it eventually found its way over to systems like the Wii via the Virtual Console.
But this was a remake, and it kind of fell under the radar of a lot of people at the time, because it's got, I guess you could call it a questionable art style, where it's not the best. I actually quite like it, but a lot of people feel it does look a bit plasticky. And the developers at the time, they said that one of the real big difficulties they had was actually converting it mechanically, so the jumping doesn't feel quite as tight as it does in the original game.
But Konami did some really great stuff on the PSP, as you can obviously tell by my list. And so the sneaky element of this is that while it's got this very decent remake of a fantastic Castlevania game, it's also got the original Ronder of Blood as an unlockable, and it's also got an enhanced version of Symphony of the Night, which is fucking brilliant. And again, you can play Symphony of the Night easy enough on modern systems, and I think they're both now available on a PS4 double pack, but this was like, how can I offer even more value for money?
And it's like, oh, I know, I'll go with some of the best respected games within their genre and get them all together in a single package.
I was aware of this because I recently did play about half of Symphony of the Night. Brilliant, by the way, still really stands up. And yeah, it was weird to read about this because people didn't seem massively keen on the actual thing they were selling, this 25D remake.
But they did really like the fact that those two other games were bundled in. And therefore you get this weird thing in the review scores. I think it landed on an 8 out of 10.
And people were sort of like, some reviewers are a little bit cooler on what the base game offers. But they're like, well, as the overall package, you can't really complain. It's got so much great stuff in it.
So I think this is a really savvy pick. I do like this. Yeah, it's a good choice because again, this is actually not a genre that's massively well served on the console.
Like the Metroidvania kind of like, you know, sort of side scrolling kind of games. It's not really, there's not like an abundance of those. In which case, I'm going to go a bit different with category five shooter, my last pick.
And I'm going to take Pursuit Force.
Oh, that's such a good choice, Samuel. That's, and again, going back to what I said earlier, it's the arcade. Good choice.
Carry on.
Yeah. So is it Chase HQ? This is kind of like riffing on Darran, is that right?
Yeah.
Yeah. So basically just like, you are the cops and there are perps going down the road and you have to jump on their cars and take them out basically. And that's essentially all the game is.
It's quite tricky, but very well suited for the PSP, I think. And yeah, there's quite sort of like exciting, muscular action. Yeah, car chases.
It's just a cool, interesting thing that you sense that they never would have made for a PS2, but makes sense as a kind of portable experience, and they did like port it back to PS2. But again, this is just kind of like one of those things that came along and people were like, oh, this is a bit... This isn't really like anything else people are making right now, but it's actually like a really nice fit for the handhelds.
And then yeah, there's a sequel as well. I think people do slightly prefer the sequel, but I think people probably played the first one and not the second one, and there's not loads in it. So original Pursuit Force it is, Darran.
Anything to add on your side?
Yeah, I think you're quite right in that this is the version that many will pick. I mean, I think the biggest takeaway with Pursuit Force 2 is that they did basically tweak the difficulty because there are some brutal spikes in the first game, which can be a pick to get past. But again, where the DS obviously had its innovation in the touchscreen and all the rest, again, this is one of those games where it's got sheer graphical grunt, which is allowing it to do something which you just wouldn't expect to play on a handheld.
And yes, you could make the argument that it riffs off Chase HQ, but it's highly likely that most of the people who would have first experienced it would have never played that game anyway. So it just feels like a really interesting hyperkinetic action game. And yes, it's one that I wrestled with included, but I had to get my outrun too in there.
I just love the mixture of car chasers in this, and then you jump onto a vehicle, dodging enemy fire, and just trying to basically, not really arrest the perps, just blow them up on the motorway basically. And it looked really nice as well. It looks very kind of like arcade-y in its presentation.
So yes, I'm glad that was well received by you, Darran. That was a tricky category to weigh up, actually, because, yeah, there are some size-scrolling shooters on there. There's also the bunch of the Sony Bend games that are on here.
I think it's two Siphon filters and one Resistance game. But I think the fact that there's no second analog stick on PSP meant that I was a little bit rehearsed about picking those. So this kind of made sense, I think, Pursuit Force.
In which case, Darran, we finally got to the end of the draft. Shall we recap the categories?
Yeah, absolutely.
Okay, cool. So for category one, perfect for PSP, I picked LocoRoco 2.
And I picked Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.
Category two, console level blockbuster, I picked God of War Chains of Olympus.
And I picked God of War Ghost of Sparta.
Category three, port remake or compilation, I picked Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.
I went with Dracula X Chronicles.
Category four, RPG, I picked Jeanne d'Arc.
I went with Final Fantasy Tactics War of the Lions.
Category five, shooter, I picked Pursuit Force.
I went with Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.
That one hurt. That really hurt that one.
Sorry.
No, it's fine. Category six, the Rockstar Games category, I've got GTA Liberty City Stories.
And I've got GTA Vice City Stories.
Category seven, racing or sports game, I've got Everybody's Tennis Portable.
I've gone for Wipeout Pure.
Category eight, music based game, I've got Lumines.
I've got Rock Band Unplugged.
Category nine, free pick one, I've got Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep.
I've got Outrun 2005 Coast to Coast.
Category ten, free pick two, I've got Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII.
And I've got Metal Gear Acid 2.
Brilliant. That is a fucking great pick. Acid 2.
Those two Metal Gears are like... If you win based on that, I think it's fair enough. That's like so much genre you've ticked off with two picks there.
It's really... I've got to admire it. It's very, very good.
I can see why you went second. That makes sense. Okay, so you can vote for the winner at Back Page: Pod on Twitter.
And I'll pin that. So yeah, vote for me or Darran. And yeah, I'll add the winner to the explanation of the episode, like the summary of the episode in the future.
But Darran, I just want to say thank you so much for coming on. It's been an absolute pleasure.
Thanks for having me, Samuel. It's been... I've long secretly wanted to come on and have never had the courage to ask for fear of being turned down.
So this has been great.
No, I'm trying to get everyone we worked with on here at some point, basically. I'm just like... you know, the quicker I have them on, the fewer new guests I have, I can still bring on to the podcast.
So it's sort of like I'm sort of rationing them out. But it was a pleasure. Thanks so much for the time and your expertise.
And yeah, it was greatly appreciated. Is there anything you want to sort of plug? Like you want to send people to your social media or pick up Retro Gamer, that sort of thing?
Yeah, so you can obviously, as we mentioned, you can buy the magazine from... I can't even remember. You can buy the magazine from...
.magazinesdirect.com. And I had them, they're great digital. And on Twitter, you can find me at RetroGamer underscore Daz.
One thing I did want to clarify though, Samuel, is you've said a few times about my expertise. I don't have any expertise. I'm just really fucking old and I've just lived for all these generations, so I haven't forgotten stuff.
So it's not... There's no like... Yeah, I'm just really old, man.
No, you look at your game collections, the stuff you've hoarded over the years. I think people realize that you are monstrously knowledgeable about this stuff. So don't talk yourself down.
I think it's been a pleasure to have you on and I'm glad we were able to make... give the PSP the sort of like justice it deserved. I think we gave it a really good run here.
Yeah, I feel so. I think... Yeah, like I said, we didn't have as much crossover as I thought we might have ended up with because there was definitely a distinct possibility of it.
But yeah, I think we've got a pretty small PlayStation that everybody would be proud to have in their collections.
Yeah, so it's a PSP Portable. So PlayStation Portable Portable. It's an extremely tiny handheld with some games on it.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts on Twitter. Just want to give one shout out to Half Minute Hero, the RPG on PSP, which is my backup RPG pick and my brother was obsessed with that game, just racing through the fundamentals of JRPGs, just really brief fashion.
That's also on Steam if you want to play that. And yeah, the podcast is Back Page: Pod and you can support us at patreon.com/backpagepod if you like what we make, want to get extra podcasts. That's it Darran, thanks so much for coming on and catch you soon, hopefully in real life.
Thank you very much Samuel.
