It's an overcast day in Bath, Somerset, a city of beautiful Roman architecture where there's plenty to do, assuming you're not planning on staying for more than one day. I've travelled down here from the clearly superior metropolis of Sheffield to meet some of its most famous residents. No, not Anthony Stewart Head, though that would undeniably make for a more interesting interview.
I'm here to speak to Matthew Castle and Samuel Roberts, the two hosts of The Back Page A Video Games Podcast, a moderately successful venture that has found an audience of societal outcasts who collect six out of ten PlayStation 2 games on Vinted. I decided to make the journey down here after receiving an anonymous tip-off. In recent times, as the podcast approached its landmark 200th episode, word had reached me that the two hosts had a cataclysmic falling out, one that threatens to shift the foundations of the video games chart on Apple Podcasts, specifically in the UK for several weeks.
Good news for those chances at TCGS, but bad news for the show's 35 loyal listeners. Could The Back Page really be over? Over the years, having appeared on the back page as their token northerner and PC gaming punching bag, I've come to regard the pair, often referred to as the two giant men of Bath, mostly by themselves, as acquaintances.
I wouldn't say friends as such, because I'd consider that a gross violation of my personal boundaries, but some might say I'm the ideal mediator between the pair of them. I have a northern accent, for one, which makes it more unreasonable to contradict me. But this rift and the grim truth behind how it went down has never been revealed to the general public, until today.
With each host refusing to speak to the other under any circumstances, it's my mission to reunite these two giant men of UK podcasting and remind them of the many delightful horrors they've unleashed upon the unsuspecting public, whether it's Gamescourt, Samuel's dad playing the oboe, or Matthew's anecdotes about his childhood in Winchester that didn't really go anywhere. So join me, Games Media's own Jeremy Peel, as I go Behind The Back Page.
Part 1â€“ Beginnings The Back Page's two hosts are former games journalists, forged in the fires of print media. Each started their careers in the latter half of the 2000s, and both rose through the ranks from humble staff writers to editors of commercially unsuccessful video game magazines in the UK. The following testimonies from Matthew and Samuel were recorded separately in the back room of an unnamed bath sandwich shop.
They've been carefully edited to provide a documented history of the podcast and its eventual demise.
They stick on me the closer because of all the magazines that got shut down on my watch.
Every magazine I've ever worked on has either been pulped or widely condemned on LinkedIn. Matthew Castle cut his teeth on NGamer, the last independent Nintendo magazine standing in the mid to late noughties. Reviewing countless dreadful Wii games on a standard definition TV stained with yoghurt, he became synonymous with the unofficial Nintendo magazine scene.
And by scene I mean a single magazine.
On NGamer I took on this goon persona, just praying to God that the readers didn't discover my dark secret that I hate rare games, unless the rare social media manager is still listening, in which case Jet Force Gemini 2 went?
Matthew eventually became editor of its short-lived successor, Nintendo Gamer, until The Closer struck again. Down the line, he worked on official Xbox Magazine, the official Xbox YouTube channel and Rock Paper Shotgun, before single-handedly driving each of them to economic ruin.
Those were tough years on OXM. If I had a therapist and I simply could not afford one on my future salary, I'd relay the trauma of pretending to like KJ and Ofuni's Rekor. You really don't bounce back from a thing like that.
Samuel Roberts began his career on problematic independent PlayStation Magazine play, writing Niko Bellic fan fiction and pretending that Resistance 2 was good, all while eating 2.99 whole chickens from Lidl in Bournemouth. I'm not saying the economic crash of 2007 and 2008 was linked to me entering the world of print media as such, but it really kind of helped. In many ways, I was the ultimate toxic asset.
Samuel then pivoted to numerous doomed print publications before landing on PC Gamer. After working tirelessly to lower this long-respected publications' editorial standards, he was paid handsomely to update the best Netflix show's SEO article at TechRadar for two years before transitioning into GamesPR. Back on PC Gamer, I pioneered making the hardware section look a bit prettier, just so that reading reviews of SSDs didn't make me want to die anymore.
I asked both giant men about their memories of meeting one another, but with their recent feud front of mind, neither could be civil.
I thought, who's this techie bastard with less editorial talent than me?
I said, who's this game-new looking motherfucker? I asked them to try again, but this time without shitting their pants. Do you remember your first meeting with Samuel, Matthew?
Vaguely, but my memory is like a sieve these days, as Back Page listeners well know. Weirdly, we both existed in the same games media sphere for years, but didn't meet properly until O&M shut down and I moved back to Bath to run OXM. Every now and then, late in the office, we exchanged our tired thoughts about trying to make a living in the dying embers of print media.
He was a bit of a young hotshot, maybe too big for his boots, which were cheap because I know Samuel didn't make a lot of money down in Bournemouth. We used to bond over Deadline Week meatball marinara's at Subway, hence two giant men were born, quite literally based on our expanding waistlines.
Samuel, do you remember when you and Matthew became friends? I remember exactly when it felt like we'd become pals. It was 2015 and we were both in the office on a Saturday, I think.
I was working on the PC Gamer redesign and Matthew was doing something for OXM, probably a retrospective on Fusion Frenzy or a 10-page feature on Rise or something. We went to a small pub in Bath called the Curda Lion. It was at this point that I started to learn that Hotel Dusk on DS was the basis of his entire personality.
We grew even closer when he fell over and shattered his knee at Gamescom 2016. Great days.
If I should die, think only this of me, that there's some corner of a foreign car park that is forever a bit of my knee.
It's safe to say that we hit it off. We each had our own personal baggage to deal with. For Matthew it was the failure of the Wii U, for me the opening years of the PS3.
That sort of shared trauma. Combined two men together. Who knows, maybe one day there'd be a crate of outlet for discussing that sort of thing.
Coming up next in Behind The Back Page.
He said fuck Northern Exposure, so I shouted fuck Onimusha, and that's when he tried to get me into a headlock.
I still reckon The Boys Across The River Drowned, and The Castle Family Fortune made the inquest go away.
Rumours about Alexa Chung's restraining orders are just that, rumours.
Part Two, Further Beginnings. As each exited print media and explored new career paths to varying success, both couldn't quite shake their unyielding passion for the medium of print. Every time I look at a back issue of a magazine I worked on, I'm reminded the piece of me that died forever to make it.
It's true, I really missed working in print, especially when the Nintendo Switch took off. If I could just have launched an unofficial Switch magazine, then got it closed down within 10 months, it would have been the perfect send off for the closer.
Move over, Wii U, it's the Nintendo Switch. But with both men having passed the age that a career in print media becomes physically and psychologically impossible to maintain, 30, they decided to explore other creative projects together. In February 2020, at the Garrick's Head Pub in Bath, Samuel first pitched the podcast idea that would become The Back Page to Matthew and his wife, Catherine Castle.
I was feeling sorry for myself after a very bumpy 2019 where I changed jobs three times and I was determined to drag Matthew down with me. I took a sip from my pint of overpriced session IPA and laid down the vision for what would ultimately become the podcast.
I remember Samuel being a bit down in the dumps that evening, but my wider recollection is that he ruined a perfectly good pub dinner by banging on about a podcast where he could bore me to shit about Onimusha 2. I'll be honest, it didn't sound like my cup of tea and I was running the Rock Paper Shotgun video channel, not into the ground I will hastily add, so I was already getting games out of my system in my day job.
What do I remember about that evening otherwise? I recall Matthew nodding furiously and saying mmm over and over again while shoving three chips into his mouth at a time. But that's the thing about Matthew, mmm is his response to everything, even in a text message.
You never really know if you're getting a good mmm or a bad mmm. I decided to quiz Matthew on his use of mmm, as it comes up in the podcast rather a lot. What's your response to that Matthew?
The larger idea was that we can make a podcast where we told war stories about working games media just after the golden age of print ended, and in doing so violate numerous NDAs, betrayed personal confidences and shattered libel laws. It was also a chance to give a powerful voice to that perennially underrepresented group overweight white men in their 30s who enjoy computer games.
I wasn't yet convinced there was a podcast in it. Samuel sent a long follow up email to myself and Catherine that I never responded to, which isn't actually that unusual for me. I should have just probably responded with, hmm.
I'll read the email out for you Jeremy. We've never actually revealed this on the podcast before, but it was meant to be the 200th episode, so I'll just go for it. Hey both, I said I'd put this in an email and now I finally have.
Sorry it's so long. I basically want to make a podcast where we can tell a few war stories and demonstrate our expertise in a way that old magazine reader types will appreciate. My current thinking is we pick an era or subject and frame it like a magazine feature.
We talk a bit about the climate of games at the time, a bit about the behind the scenes stuff, but mostly about the games. I figure this approach would be interesting because you bring an angle to it rather than just talking about one game like a lot of retro podcasts do. Truth be told, Catherine, I was just talking to Matthew about this originally, but I'd love to have your valuable perspective too if you're up for it.
I would, after all, probably want to record this in your house. Brackets, you own a blue yeti, right? Well, if we want to refine the format, we can do that as we go.
I'll prepare some notes before each episode, so you've got some reference materials. I'm also prepared to edit it. Brackets, in the lightest possible sense, and pay to host it.
It would be cool to have a couple of magazine style back section ideas, too. They don't even have to be tied to the episode idea. They could just be runners to break up the conversation.
I think each episode should be an hour long. That way, if we record for two hours, we've got two weeks' worth of stuff at a time, broken into parts. I don't have a title or anything, but can the creators of Barrel Watch and Orange Is The New Track really do wrong in this area?
Ah, memories. Matthew didn't give a flying fuck.
It goes on a bit, doesn't it? Yeah, you can see why I wasn't dying to jump in. I had other things to think about anyway.
It was the start of the year, 2020, and I had an oddly good feeling about the months ahead.
You know what happened next. Furloughs, toilet paper shortages, sourdough starters, John Krasinski hosting a nice news show, sitcom casts reuniting on Zoom, Gal Gadot's cover of Imagine, Eat Out to Help Out, Tenet, The Horror, The Horror. As the pandemic shut down the world in March 2020, the Deliveroo debris stacked up and the two giant men grew ever larger.
Now inflated by two additional waste sizes, Samuel was able to pressure Matthew into starting the podcast in November of that year. I had a stroke of great fortune. Matthew was laid off by Rock Paper Shotgun.
Yay!
So I had him corded. He had to make the podcast.
We agreed to record a couple of episodes just to see how it would go, but if no one listened, I was fully prepared to disown it, tell GamesIndustry.biz that Samuel made me record it against my consent.
So I knew Episode 1 had to be something super mainstream, and I spent most of my year on TechRadar updating boring SEO articles about the price of the PS5, so covering the new consoles felt like the right idea to kick things off. Even though I find industry commentary tedious as shit, I was willing to pretend I cared for one hour. But to give it this print media flavour I'd always envisioned, and by always I mean since February when I sent that email, I came up with the idea for Episode 2, Game Review Scores We Got Wrong, which helped explain what the podcast was to Matthew.
It was a chance to audit lots of dubious writing about Wii and Xbox 360 games for cheap laughs to an audience of about five people. And yet when I said this bit aloud to Matthew as part of my pitch, he still raised an eyebrow.
Fortunately for Samuel, by the end of 2020, I was finally as miserable as he was. I saw the shape of what he had in mind and reluctantly went through with it, despite already serving as comic relief on two existing podcasts.
But where did the name The Back Page actually come from? The answer will neither move nor surprise you. They dumped a load of nonsense suggestions into a spreadsheet.
Matthew actually came up with the majority of the suggested names for the podcast. My one suggestion was the thick old Games Magazine Men podcast. That's thick with two Cs, by the way.
In the comments part of our possible podcast names Excel tab, Matthew sarcastically wrote, You nailed it and won.
I haven't actually looked at these for four years at this point. The back section, free gifts, back compat chat, backwards compatible, update required, patch notes podcast, good god.
Nestled among those was The Back Page. It was a clear winner to me because it summarized the legacy of jokey back pages of a video games magazine and therefore the tone we were trying to go for. Also maybe there's a poignance to it being the last page of the magazine and neither of us is working in print anymore.
Update required is particularly embarrassing though. I wouldn't be showing my face around Bath City Center if I'd been pitching that.
The iconic back page logo of two blokes about to kiss over a microphone was the cherry on top.
The first episode of The Back Page, PS5 vs Xbox Series X, was a notorious flop. A lukewarm analysis of the two then-new consoles, neither seemed particularly engaged in discussing SSDs, framerates and other tedious nonsense that only lonely lads on Reddit are invested in. Instead, the pair found their feet in revisiting petty nonsense from the 2000s.
Onstage gaffes from E3 2006, Wii games that Matthew awarded 93% before they landed a 3 in Edge, or brown first-person shooters that the rest of us would rather forget. Despite my best intentions, I knew the first episode was poor, which is why we had the second one ready to go before we'd ever told anyone about the podcast's existence. We recorded both episodes at Matthew's house, technically violating lockdown laws if I recall correctly, but no more so than the Conservative government was doing at the time.
Really, we're just lucky that Scribs and Tamora tweeted the announcement post for the podcast otherwise no one would have given a shit.
The Back Page was off to a flying start. Immediately finding an audience among those who remember the good parts of print media in the noughties, and not the lack of diversity in writers and editors, the frequently pornographic classified ads at the back of each issue, or the often problematic Lads Mag style writing that throws women out of the industry by design. Across a variety of themed episodes, both men set out their stalls.
Matthew went to bat for dregs on Nintendo platforms that no one else agreed was good, while Samuel recalled his experience with the early days at the PlayStation 3, like a victim of Stockholm Syndrome. Offhand remarks would become sweeping ideologies. Metal Gear Solid 4 is bound to the PS3 and should never come to other platforms.
Metroid Other M is quite good, actually. Such teachings form the church of The Back Page. Blokes in their thirties worshipped them.
My content strategy was incredibly complex and required a gentle touch. What I would do is listen to other podcasts and then steal their ideas.
Samuel took everything from The Big Picture, a film podcast I introduced him to. The only exception was Gamescourt. His one original idea happened to be the worst I'd ever heard, and seemed to be a labyrinthine justification for his obsession with hoarding bullshit and his failure to secure a mortgage.
I went along with it to keep the peace, safe in the knowledge that I already owned a house.
But despite its gristle level nutritional value, Gamescourt, in which Samuel would make questionable second-hand purchases of games, then justify them in a fictional courtroom, was a hit format with the listeners. And Matthew found his popular alter ego, Judge Castle, was the centrepiece of the growing fictional universe that surrounded these episodes.
I have no further comments on Gamescourt. There are relatives who won't look me in the eye after listening to these episodes.
Gamescourt was me playing to Matthew's characterful strengths. He only does his very best work when he's at his lowest ebb. And I just knew that making him talk about the time I bought, say, Sonic Chronicles The Dark Brotherhood for Â£4.77 would break him.
The best content came in pushing his resolve to the limit. That's because Matthew's always been a cult figure in the games industry, sort of a quasi-intellectual clown who's in on the joke. He has big but doctor I am pagliacci energy.
He's Jerry Lewis in The King of Comedy, a kind of dour funny man who's got a Luger tucked under his hotel pillow. He's a podcasting goldmine, frankly.
Respectfully, and please make sure he only hears us when the documentary goes live, Samuel is a giant fucking baby. He gets tetchy about the smallest things imaginable, like if you make a joke about his categories in the Draft episode, or query the wisdom of purchasing Leia on PS3 17 years after its release. I was railroaded into all sorts of podcasting travesies, and I never complained just to stop him from having a tantrum.
That's because I'm the most conflict-averse person you will ever meet. I'd crash my own car to avoid having a difficult conversation. Well, I'll actually get Catherine to crash the car, because she's technically my chauffeur, as previously established on past episodes.
It was a two-sided and mostly polite creative partnership, but if I wasn't happy with the way Matthew responded to my episode ideas, I wasn't above yelling that he was a cock in the middle of an episode recording. Despite the inherent tension in the creative partnership, each was about to experience a level of credibility among their peers they never previously established.
Coming up in Behind The Back Page...
My concern was that Samuel wasn't taking the works of Kago Kikushino seriously.
He just wouldn't let the Borgon tweet go, and when Jeff Keighley's legal team got in touch, I knew that was the beginning of the end for us.
Blorko really created a schism in the partnership, and I think it killed Samuel that he never had a tweet pop off like that.
Part 3, Hightening Tensions. As the podcast entered its second and third years, it found a steady audience of around 6,000 weekly victims, I mean listeners. The ups and downs of the podcast, emphasis on the word downs, became moments of legend.
Whatever went down in any given episode, I was committed to keeping my cool, especially during the draft episodes.
Uh, I'm gonna take Star Wars Tie Fighter. Oh, fuck!
Oh, that sucks!
Yeah, I would try never to get upset over something completely trivial, if I could avoid it. It is another Mario Kart, isn't it? It's a whole Mario Kart game of campaign.
Yeah, the campaign. Story mode, I'm sorry about you.
Wait, what do you call it in a fucking Mario? You know, the thing that you do, the career? It's another career in Mario Kart?
Generally, I think we hit a positive, creative trajectory with the podcast. The listeners seemed happy. Our peers guested on occasional episodes out of pity, and I dragged Matthew along with whatever bullshit idea I came up with.
Once we got some level of popularity, it was time to rinse the listenership for all they were worth. When The Back Page Patreon launched in April 2022, the hosts were shocked to learn that people actually wanted to give them real money to support the podcast.
The Patreon has allowed me to eat pret sandwiches 7 days a week, and for that I will always be grateful.
I spent the money on Rare DS games, cheeseburgers from Magoo and Bath, then on funding an armed rebel militia in a nation I'm not at liberty to name. The podcast would eventually celebrate its 100th episode, an inaccessible self-referential catastrophe, composed of clips from fake episodes. It was an idea stolen almost completely from an episode of the sitcom Community.
The first cut of episode 100 was a fucking disaster, I will own up to that.
I let Samuel lead the way with the script for episode 100, and that's why it was a debacle to make. But once I cut about 90% of the jokes out, I think it reached a level I would describe as adequately satisfactory.
The Hitman bit at the start was good at least.
Good evening, 47. Your destination is the quaint British city of Bath. Your target is Matthew Castle.
Former journalist turned podcast baron and his morally corrupt associate, Samuel Roberts. Known as the Two Giant Men of Somerset, they turned small-time magazine careers into a thriving, low-effort media business, blackmailing their own followers into funding an extravagant lifestyle of meats and sandwiches. Both are due to switch on the city's Christmas lights, celebrating their dubious contributions to journalism.
I'm sure you'll leave a present or two in their stock in 47. After all, they do say print is dead. Good luck, agent.
That was the best thing I've ever written. I'm not even joking. It took me four months with a team of eight writers to crack it.
It's a real testament to what a podcaster can achieve with Â£72 and an actress working under duress. Episode 100 drew acclaim from the podcast deranged listenership. Buttered up with Patreon cash, the two giant men reached a level of creative success they'd each longed for, even if the podcast was theoretically keeping Matthew and Samuel from achieving their actual dreams of writing three-star detective novels and dubious Batman comics, respectively.
But the good vibes would soon curdle and tensions began to emerge as the pair recorded some of their most memorable episodes.
In general, the draft episodes where an element of competition is baked into the premise brought out the worst in us. Tie-fire hurt me bad, Jeremy, but the content was undeniably great. The listeners were hooked.
Unfortunately, things only escalated from there.
I think we can pinpoint the Nintendo DS draft as the beginning of the end for The Back Page.
Do you think the DS draft was a turning point for your partnership, Samuel? I think there's something in that. It was the most I've ever hurt Matthew on air.
And I want the listeners to know that if I could take back what I did, I wouldn't because it was extremely entertaining. Samuel went weapons-free on Hotel Dusk Room 215, a 2007 Nintendo DS mystery game long considered one of the key techs of The Back Page, and as he'd long known, a fundamental component of Matthew Castle's identity. Indeed, Matthew's frequent endorsement of the game on the podcast shook the United Kingdom CEX economy to its core.
Content warning, the following clip features a man's heart being broken. Looking into the mystery of what happened to some guy he's on the trail of. His former partner, is that right Matthew, when he used to be a cop?
So yeah, and then you have lots of like languid discussions of characters.
Stop saying languid.
And then you have, that's true though.
A lot of damage was done that day. Damage to me, damage to Carl High, damage to the Touch Generations brand, damage to the memory of Sing.
I don't know what to say. Hotel Dusk was simply not very good. At least Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, another series that Matthew has used, is the basis of his entire personality, has this level of quality that justifies its cult appeal.
With Hotel Dusk, it was like someone was telling me Midsomer Murders is as good as The Wire. Brother, it isn't. I share Samuel's reflections on what's now known as Languid Gate with Matthew.
Well, that's why he's not on the fucking Castle Family Switch Online membership anymore.
I won't lie, now it's been taken away from me, I do miss having access to Jet Force Gemini.
After Samuel's public execution of Hotel Dusk, I knew I had to get him back and I knew the Draft episodes were the place to do it, but it would take time well over a year before I worked out exactly how to do it. I had to nuke his home turf just like he dropped a big old dog turd on mine.
What happened next would break the podcast apart, creating ripples in the UK game podcasting scene for literally two hours. You see, it's the slow knife. The knife that takes its time.
The knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between the bones. That's the knife that cuts deepest. Tally-O-Gull, The Dark Knight Rises.
Coming up on Behind The Back Page.
After the Batman Begin tweet, it no longer felt appropriate to make fun of Michael Caine.
Matthew never got any of the end-game redditors on the podcast because they all think he's a dickhead.
Castle Island, all fun and games until it sparked an international incident with the Chagos Islands.
Part Four, The Incident. As The Back Page entered 2024, the podcast maintained its waning and predictable mix of series retrospectives, numerous unwanted mailbag episodes and questionable drafts, where Matthew pretended GTA V was a PC game. No, I'm not bitter for coming a distant third in that one, Orcs Must Die Forever.
In late 2023, we took a break from the podcast, as people know, and while we told the listeners at the time that a pause was needed because we were both exhausted, the truth is that the tension behind the scenes had gone out of control.
What started with Hotel Dusk in the DS draft had snowballed. The second a recording ended, we basically ceased contact with one another. The Back Page became pure kayfabe, like the Attitude era of WWE in podcasting form, and our dynamic was just a facade.
But at the same time, it was just too big to fail. The Patreon was keeping us both in artery clogging cheeseburgers and sweaty fried chicken.
I boarded a plane to Japan, just to avoid bumping into Matthew and Bath. We could no longer look each other in the eye, it was this sad but inevitable end point of two geniuses colliding. Like when Jarvis Cocker slapped his own arse at Michael Jackson's Brit Awards performance.
Matthew is Michael Jackson in that analogy, just to be clear. The truth behind what happened next has never been revealed. Until now.
It was late October 2024, we were recording the long-awaited PS2 redraft episode. We'd been on a bit of a roll that summer with draft episodes and we got a bit drunk on the idea of bringing in a third guest to amp up the competitiveness of the draft. Looping back around to the PS2 for our 200th episode felt strangely appropriate to me.
The third drafter on that PS2 redraft episode can't be revealed as a result of a witness protection order from Bath Crown Court.
But things had already started getting frosty in the weeks leading up to this. Matthew pretending GTA V and MGS V were native PC games was a slight I just couldn't let go.
I can now reveal that those draft choices were all a ruse, part of my long term plan to strike back at Samuel for Langrid Gate. Carl Hyde would be avenged.
I guess that week drafted first, he took GTA Vice City, which is a bit basic bitch as a pick if you ask me, but Matthew was second and he had two picks to make. He took Silent Hill 2 which I thought was wise, but then he took Final Fantasy X, which a lot of listeners know is my favourite game of all time. We both knew that this was a shot across the bow.
It's a draft, we're all trying to take things from each other. I've watched Catherine play Final Fantasy X, it was a totally valid pick. But I will fess up, I've long known this game means a lot to Samuel.
This was his home turf, his Carl Hyde. But it wasn't enough to take the game from him, I had to demolish it brick by brick, salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again. Nothing less than causing the tantrum of the century was going to do, even if I knew it would doom The Back Page.
In Final Fantasy X, players take on the role of Tidus, a young man who's catapulted into the future by a big time travelling whale that turns out to be his dad. Spoiler alert for the preceding sentence. It's a Japanese RPG.
This isn't my area whatsoever. It's probably best you just play the clip Jeremy, it hurts to talk about it.
So for my next pick for category 6 RPG, I'm going to take Final Fantasy X.
Oh you motherfucker. What for pick number 2?
I'm taking this Samuel to demonstrate to you that the things you love do not belong to you. They are fragile. They can be destroyed.
Do you recall the time you called Hotel Dusk on DS a languid?
That was more than a year ago.
Do you recall, Samuel?
Yes, I remember. That was a hotel of bad hangs, mate.
Well how did you sleep at night knowing that you called the game languid?
I slept like a fucking baby. How did you sleep at night knowing you picked TIE Fighter to win the 90s PC gaming draft when you'd ever even fucking played it?
Where to start with this game's war crimes? The voice acting? Terrible.
The main character? Just an unbelievable twat. His best friend?
Another unbelievable twat. Just Bender from Futurama doing a Jamaican accent. That big blue guy?
Third unbelievable twat. And it just takes forever to get going. The battle music is mead, Eunice, like this fucking wet blanket, it's religious metaphors, subtle as a punch to the face, and it's great as sims, Samuel.
I'm not talking about the fucking whale who's his dad or whatever. Blitzball. I'm talking about Blitzball.
This is the single worst minigame I've ever played in a game. Fuck it. Fuck Blitzball.
And fuck you. This is a languid game.
Stop the recording. This podcast is fucking done. And fuck Kyle Hyde.
Oh, is that it? I thought you fell out over something serious. You ended the podcast because you didn't enjoy a final fantasy game you like.
Well, yeah, I mean, the fuck you wasn't great either. But there's thousands of pounds in Patreon funds on the line. You walk away from all that for Blitzball.
Did we learn nothing from the cycles of violence as depicted in The Last of Us Part 2, Jeremy? Man hands on misery to man. Philip Larkin.
I like that he quoted Philip Larkin and Talia Al Ghul, when we all know he really only understands one of those things, the dumb cartoon one.
You think you went too far that day, Matthew?
Shouting and fuck you at Samuel might have been a step too far. As it reverberated around the overturned coffee table I use as a recording studio, I did think it was a little out of character for me as the more reasonable host of the podcast. But the draft episodes, they're epic operas of violence and death.
I was just giving the listeners what they thought they wanted. People love it.
But people did not love it. The podcast was put on hold. And as the hosts deliberated privately with their friends and family members about what to do next with The Back Page, a source tipped me off that something unpleasant had occurred between the two giant men.
I actually emailed Jeremy and tipped him off because I thought the whole thing was quite embarrassing. But I went under a pseudonym so he would never know it was me. Pesto underscore Basil underscore Mister at outlook.com.
He'll no doubt be shocked to learn the tipster's identity.
I'd like to say we ceased all contact following the falling out, but the truth is that we started airing all our petty grievances towards each other. The 200 episodes of Repressed Rage boiling to the surface in a string of WhatsApp barbs. I told him Skyward Sword was an Edge 7.
I told him his dad only plays the saboteur because he's downloaded the DLC Tits.
I told him Big the Cat was based on him.
I told him he was too intellectually deficient to understand the majesty of Tears of the Kingdom.
I told him we only disliked metaphor refantasio because it didn't have any Japanese schoolgirls in it.
Eventually we just stopped exchanging messages altogether and since then, which was four days ago, we've not spoken. Samuel deleted me on Instagram. I don't even post on there.
I even went as far as deleting all the pictures of Matthew off my phone. That was painful actually. Though I did hold onto the foot of him eating a big sausage at Gamescom in case I ever need to blackmail him or hike up the premiums on his health insurance.
Coming up next on Behind The Back Page. Is there any hope of reconciliation between the two giant men? Or is it curtains for the moderately popular UK Gaming podcast?
Plus all of this to come. By the fifth time he said psychology of a goomba, I was ready to send Matthew to the morgue.
Samuel took my jives about Evangelion body pillows far too seriously.
After the listeners criticized my laugh, I genuinely considered hiring large men to break their legs, but by that point I had already made the down payment of my new gaming PC.
Part 5. Reunion? When I was first roped into the Behind The Back Page documentary project, my intentions were to reunite two old friends, who I knew had respect for each other at their core.
And yet, as I've looked deeper into the fractures that have emerged between Matthew and Samuel across 200 episodes of The Back Page, I've merely observed a modern parable of fragile masculinity. The two men who just can't bear to apologise to each other and would rather hold a grudge than accept mild criticism of their respective Japanese computer games. The modest success of The Back Page has completely and utterly gone to their heads.
The world around them continues to spin, the human race oblivious to their petty squabbles. And yet to them, this is a saga of great nations at war, of Olympian gods battling for supremacy. Is there anything Matthew could do or say that would heal the rift between you?
I think if he apologized to me, to Blitzball, to Yoshinori Katase, to the Bersaid Oryx, they're a Blitzball team, that would begin to fix things. I think in general, we need to reset the dial on the draft episode so we can keep doing this. And maybe Matthew can apologize for picking TIE Fire that time without having played it, and for picking GTA V and MGS V in the PC gaming draft and pretend they're PC games.
They're just not really PC games, are they? Can Samuel say anything to you to put things right?
Well, he's the one who's angry. I've made my peace with Hotel Dust being languid. Many of the best things in life are languid.
Waiting for lovely food at a restaurant, museum exhibitions, French cinema. I've learned to love languid things.
How do you respond to Samuel's comments about apologizing for past draft episodes?
Look, Samuel's issues with GTA and MGS not being PC games are between him and his psychologist. That's a hard line for me. But I will be willing to apologize for the Final Fantasy X thing, even though Blitzball was total arse.
And I might even throw in a sorry or two for the Tie Fighter, but he has to pay for what he's done to Hodel Dusk. We need reparations on both sides.
I plan to bring the host to a neutral location in Bath, JC's Kitchen, an infamous eatery mentioned many times on The Back Page. Unfortunately, the weather forecast likes showers, and the tent where JC's Kitchen is usually based is nowhere to be seen. We go to a nearby coffee shop instead, where a latte somehow costs 8 quid.
This is why I try to avoid the south.
It's been a long time, Matthew.
Yeah, days.
Say it, Matthew.
Samuel, I'm sorry for what I said about Blitzball, and I didn't mean what I said about Final Fantasy X. I mean, yes, the voice acting is bad, and it's rife with bad hangs, and I don't even think Blitzball is tolerable, but I can acknowledge when I've overstepped the mark. Maybe shouting fuck you was a step too far.
Samuel, I don't really give two shits about Japanese RPGs as established many times, but do you accept that? Yeah, I do, and I'm sorry for what I said about Hotel Dusk. I hope they do add Kyle Hi to Smash Bros.
one day, just for you. Right around the time they add Gino, who I know you've grown to respect since the Super Mario RPG remake came out last year.
Yeah, well, you know, don't push it too far, but listen, apology accepted. What do you say? Shall we restart the Patreon?
Old Castle's Deliveroo debts are getting a little spicy. They're threatening to send guys around.
Yeah, why not? I think it's about time that this has brought me an import WonderSwan color anyway.
Oh, I only would have been ashamed to break up a winning partnership on the 200th episode. We should get to enjoy this victory.
We did build something from nothing, and I am proud of the podcast for sure. That's the thing about me though, I am petty enough to walk away from something valuable I've created over the most minor bullshit imaginable. It's one of the many personal weaknesses I confront on a daily basis.
That and being prickly and complicated, punishing myself for never working hard enough, drinking two Monster Energy drinks a day, being psychologically warped by the pandemic, being addicted to sandwiches and fried chicken, nuking the listeners on Discord from orbit over slight so minor, they can hardly be said to have existed at all. Well, the list goes on basically.
Isn't that okay, Sam? We are known as the two giant men, not two perfect men. I'm not without my faults, leaving basically all the podcast admin to you, not realising episode plans have been going into my junk mail for an entire month.
Forgetting to pay me the Patreon funds, staying up until 2am, writing freelance, then punishing yourself for no longer being funny enough in your copy, being emotionally dependent on sweets. Well, again, the list goes on really, doesn't it?
Yeah, but that's alright, isn't it? We make something great and people continue to give a shit, which is the greatest privilege of all. So let's keep descending down into the darkest tunnels of mementos deep beneath Bath.
Yeah, fine. Or as you would say, hmm.
Now kiss.
Epilogue, the future. My work in Bath is done, and The Back Page, a video games podcast, is saved. I can return to the far greater city of Sheffield, but how long until the hosts fall out over something else that's totally trivial and pointless?
I'd leave Somerset with the lingering feeling that these two giant men are only ever one contentious Mario spin-off away from having a full-on meltdown. But until then at least, the podcasting magic, the words of some strange men on the internet, not mine, can continue.
Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Sam Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, first of all, how's the toe? Still discoloured?
Fine, I think it's getting there. The good news is it's no longer yellow.
Lovely stuff. Matthew, let me just say, it's great we were able to put that unpleasantness behind us and get back to doing our best work on this podcast.
Yeah, hear, hear, Samuel. It is a pleasure to be able to do this again.
So, in this week's episode, we're ranking the 100 horniest Hideo Kojima tweets. Matthew, how are you feeling about it?
Well, let's just say it wasn't easy to get it down to 100.
Hello and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast, the real version of this episode. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. We're in the strange position of recording this bit of the episode before people have heard the first bit. People will know what the first bit is by now.
It doesn't require much explanation, really. The title of the episode and the last 35, 40 minutes, however long it took to record that whole thing. It tells the whole story, really.
But I just want to ask you, we're recording this before that first bit, like I say, how do you think that will go down?
Well, I hope it will go down well. I have some nerves about it, not about its quality, but about my ability to deliver on it. So you wrote the script, which I absolutely loved, really made me laugh when I was reading through it.
But the whole time I was like, oh man, I hope I make this work to a level that doesn't undermine it, because it's parodying such a specific thing. So I don't know how successful it's been, because obviously we haven't done it yet.
That is the question, isn't it? It's like on paper, I can hear in my head what it should sound like, but then it's three people who have never acted, who have to act it out basically.
There's the acting element and there's also professional podcast producers who paid loads of money to make these podcasts sound really good, and I really muddle my way through that side of things. So the ability to weave in music, I guess that's a thing that's happened. You'll know as you've heard it.
But yes, I just hope it wasn't, I hope it wasn't ironically the thing that ends the podcast that you were so unhappy with the edit, that this podcast is now canceled.
I think it'll be all right. I think it's, I've got in my head that we should just approach it in this quite naturalistic way. I was going to get Jeremy to do it in this kind of like John Ronson kind of way, where it's just a little bit like it's quite formal and sort of polite, but a tiny bit stern.
Those are the directions I'm going to give him when people are listening to this. So Jeremy is really key to the whole thing. And we gave it an extra week.
So I mean, it probably makes sense to people now why we needed the extra week, because we've kind of done two episodes worth of work back to back, arguably a bit more because, like Matthew says, I wrote the first version of the script back in January on my, so sort of week off before I went to work at Bethesda. And then, yeah, I've redrafted it twice over the course of the year, and each redraft like killed me inside. It was so hard to do.
But hopefully people have enjoyed it. I've certainly enjoyed writing jokes for the three of us anyway, so.
Yes. And this is so meta that we're, people are used to us saying the episode's bad as we're doing the episode, to have us getting nervous about the episode before it's even been done, but people have already heard it.
Yeah, it's ridiculous. It has almost no value. It's a bit of insight, really.
Anyway, I hope people enjoyed that idea. I came up with it. I mean, it's a rip-off of the Behind The Music, but more specifically, The Simpsons parody of that, Behind The Laughter, the sex, drugs, lies, Millhouse.
That was very much the vibe I was tapping into there with the script, and basically every kind of the last dance style, talking heads thing you can think of from the last 20 years of media, basically. So lots I was stealing from there. But yeah, it was fun to do, Matthew.
At least at this point, it's been fun to do. And we'll know when we're listening, when you're listening back to this, whether it went down well or not. So good stuff.
Episode 200. OK, well, we are recording this, Matthew, on the most overcast day in Bath history. I think I woke up and thought, fuck, I've got to have the big light on while I'm recording a podcast.
Never ideal, really.
So I'm sitting in the dark with my head in a coffee table.
Yeah, great. Like a Silent Hill enemy of some kind. Just something fucked up.
You see down a corridor. What is that? It's recording studio head.
Here he comes. Really stretching that joke to its limits these days. So how are you feeling about all this after 200 episodes, Matthew, after almost four years and over a million downloads now?
A million downloads. That's crazy. Yeah, I am feeling good.
It's been a weird year this year for me, just because I changed my job last year and got back into the YouTube channel management game, which friends and family have told me is never me at my best self, because it tends to be a bit all-consuming.
Yeah.
Yeah, it does. Yeah, I've been down those mines for a bit. I've literally as of this week emerged from those mines, so I'm in recovery now.
So yeah, the last couple of years have been a little blurry, but people seem to be having a good time, so I think it's good.
Yeah, we've now produced so many podcasts that people will mention ones we've done, and I don't really remember recording them. I think I've got a strong enough top line memory of all the different ideas we've done, but they were mentioned specific bits or things we talked about, and those are starting to become a bit blurry because yeah, we've done 200 regular episodes, and on Patreon we've done I think 59 or 60 episodes as well. So that's like fucking loads really.
It's been a busy old time. I've enjoyed it. I've enjoyed having something to pour my creative energies into, and we both had quite a few ups and downs during the podcast.
You said something really insightful last week when we were playing Mario Party. Really? Yeah.
What was it you said about the pandemic? Because we're talking about this as one of the few good things that really personally for us came out of the pandemic, but you said something about how the pandemic screwed one part of everyone's life, at least. Like, I can't remember exactly how you said it, but I just thought it was eloquently put.
Do you remember exactly what you said or is that a lot?
No, it sounds profound.
Yeah, you said something about how, you know, no matter who you are, the pandemic fucked one part of your life, whether it was your social life, your marriage, your job, you know.
Yes, yes, I can't repeat it with any eloquence. You know, a married party put me in a certain headspace, clearly.
Cutting meat will do that to a man.
Yeah. No, it was more that in the year since, I've just yet to meet anyone who was untouched by it, which obviously sounds a bit trite. But the thing that struck me was how, yeah, it was always like a different part of their life, you know, whether it was their job, you know, their health or their relationships with family or friends.
It felt like no one got out with all three of those things unscathed. Some really unlucky people got knobbled on like all three fronts and their lives are like transformed. I would say luckily for me, it was just the job, you know, that took the hit, which I'd say of those three things is probably the one that you, you know, is like least damaging to you in the long term, I think.
And also kind of, you know, bought me a bit more free time to do the podcast, which was obviously great. But yeah, it's definitely a kind of, the podcast sits in an odd space in my life, where it's in like a constant tug of war with the headspace I have to give to my job at any given time. And the changing nature of the job has just meant like, I've had periods where I was able to like, phone in a bit more and the job there is, and it's where I've had to like, phone in the podcast a little bit more.
Luckily, you know, I don't think, I don't think people have necessarily noticed, which is good.
Well, I think it just, is that a, no, I don't think it has.
I disagree.
Well, because I have, I have basically, I think, I would say that the, the one thing that's probably the most noticeable change, and I don't think it's like a massive, massively to the podcast detriment, because we've, it's changed a lot anyway, is that in the first couple of years, we did a lot more deep dives than older series and stuff. So you were like, you had your sort of your gap year, as it were, and you played through all the Zeldas, you did that episode, like you had the Kirby deep dive, and you did that, we did that episode, and like the Ace Attorney one as well, and we did God of War together as well. Those episodes we've done fewer of, but there's a few reasons for that.
One, I think we have not quite had the same amount of time to dedicate to deep diving on a series like that, but also I had to remind myself in scrolling back through some of the episodes we've done in the years prior, that 2021 and 2022 were affected by the pandemic in terms of video games not really coming out at the same clip. So it actually made more sense to do that because the blockbuster, blockjam of stuff that we're now playing this year, and last year in particular, it really sort of converged, didn't it? It means that we've kind of switch tack to covering contemporary games a bit more than dedicating our time to deep diving on older games, which makes sense when there's newer games to talk about.
I think that's been a perfectly fine transformation. What we've been playing episodes always seem to go down very well, Matthew. So yeah, that's one way it's changed, but I don't know if you really notice any changes otherwise, but I don't know, maybe you disagree.
You don't get a Mario deep dive because I had to play Stellar Blade.
Yeah, exactly. So that is different. I think the podcast has benefited in different ways from that, though.
You're so up on contemporary games. You have been for the last year or so. So we've done okay out of it.
And besides, I don't really mind making episode plans anyway. I think I feel a bit better about it when I've got my hand on the tiller, and I don't have to depend on you to do it.
I always think if there's ever been a very rare episode where I've written bits of the plan or the questions out, I think you can always tell when you're reading it that it's not you.
I think I make it too obvious on purpose, probably.
You can hear it in your voice like, what the fuck is this?
There was an episode you did with Rich though, just you and Rich. That was really good. I thought that plan was...
That was really stressful though. That was so edited down because you're so in the rhythm of running it and starting it. It gets to me and I'm like, how the fuck do we start this podcast?
Both that one and the one that I did with Stu. I think they get better as they go on those episodes, but at the outset, they're a little stilted because I literally don't remember how to say hello and things like that. Until I've heard my name said and I go, hello, I can't really lock in.
I understand that. It's not necessarily the simplest. When we started, I didn't even really think of myself as the host.
I thought we were going to share hosting duties or something, and then we just found that rhythm. I felt like for a while at the start as well, I was still trying to pitch you that doing it was a good idea, and you just weren't convinced. That's something obviously I've written into the script that people have listened to, the idea that I had to pitch Matthew on it, and that pitch e-mail that was discussed in the script was real.
That was a real thing that I sent to Matthew before. In January 2020, what's the worst thing that can happen this year? I realize now I made all those jokes in the podcast, but yes.
That one also makes... I should probably point out for people who've just listened to that first part of the episode, that e-mail probably makes it sound like Catherine was cut out of the Back Page story a little bit. It does.
She was on the initial e-mail, where I think it was because we had talked about it at the pub, and we definitely talked about it when Catherine was there, and I think it was more of a polite, hey, we were all there while we were talking about this. I think that was the pitch. I think it was always going to be us two.
I just wanted to put that out there, that it wasn't anything sinister.
Yeah, I realized that the optics of it maybe aren't great, that we've cut Catherine from history or something like that. But yeah, it was something we previously discussed and then discussed again. Also, I was just mega-depressed.
I think a really key part of the gestation of the podcast that we never talked about was my 2019. I mean, you were there for this. It's just an absolute fucking blast zone of a year, basically.
So I left. Should I tell this story?
You can tell your own watered-down version of it if you want. But yeah, it's interesting.
All right. So what happened was is that it was okay. This actually starts of Black Friday 2018 and an e-commerce graph that was down on the previous year.
I think I didn't realize I was responsible for, and then I drove myself absolutely nuts over Black Friday weekend trying to get this graph up. When I did, I think the guy just emailed back and went, yeah, nice, your graph went back up. Cheers, and that was it.
I was just like, this was genuinely the worst. In fact, I remember the exact day we got the email. I was in a KFC with you and Rich Stanton after that Rezzy 2 hands-on event in London.
Oh yeah, by Paddington.
Yeah, and I got that email, and I was so like, just felt the blood rise and then the panic rise. When I was there, the UK team just did not have enough staff to do everything, and I was just doing everything basically, apart from the news. And it was just, that happened, and then I was, I remember going for like a meal on the Sunday afterwards, and just being like almost a little bit emotional when I was out with my ex.
It's a bit like, I don't think I can keep doing this job anymore. That's like, this is...
I know, I've had a couple of those dinners.
Yeah, and that kind of cascades. So I start thinking about moving on from PC Gamer at the end of 2018. That is the inciting incident.
That's why I moved on. What I actually should have done is just told my boss. I'm really struggling here.
You need to hire more staff or I'm going to leave, but I didn't do that. I would absolutely do that now working at a job. I didn't do it then.
Okay, so that leads to this job comes up at Readpop, who used to own Eurogamer and a bunch of other brands until they decided to offload them this year. They're now owned by IGN. Basically, they had this job to be head of content at MCM Comic Con.
I would say that... So this job was down in Brighton. It required me to move from Barth to Brighton.
I got the job and made the move in summer 2019. And my boss, Tim, was really cut up about it when I left. When Tim came on that episode, people probably got the sense that I had gotten really well with Tim.
He went to bat for me for so many years on PC Gamer. When I moved to the website, he was really supportive of that. And he always treated me with so much respect as well.
I wish I had been in retrospect and given him more thought. I went and did this job. And I would say that it was just that the team there were really nice at MCM Comic-Con.
I really enjoyed working with them. They were really cool. But it was the wrong job from the off.
It just felt like the wrong job. It was the big point of attention was that they used to have someone who booked talent, like a talent manager. Talent is really the lifeblood of all these conventions.
You obviously see, I think they've got Ella Purnell from, they've had, by the time you're listening to this, they had her at the one they just did in October. So fallout, big guest. And so I got there.
They didn't have this person in place, so I had to book all the talent basically from scratch. And they had three shows coming up. They didn't have any headline guests and I had to, and they were happening.
I got there in July. They were happening in September, October and November. You really need about six months notice to book good, to book great guests.
Again, the team were just really, really nice, but I just felt so like I'd moved my entire life down to Brighton.
You did bring your contact book of Hollywood talent with you.
Yeah, I just gave, just gave Simon Pegg a bell and was like, hey Simon, can you come down? After like one week, I immediately started plotting my return to future. And so, I have no beef whatsoever with Readpop or the people that work there, just to make that clear.
Gareth Beavis on TechRadar was creating this entertainment channel. They were launching Disney Plus, and obviously Disney was at the end of 2019. So running a channel from the UK that could make traffic from that, they were really good to me on TechRadar, and I moved back.
But when I moved back to Bath in January 2020, great stuff. I'm sure the year ahead is going to go fantastically. I was so wounded by the whole thing.
I was also like fucking lost loads of money moving as well. So came back to future and was really wounded by it. I like working on TechRadar, but I did miss writing about games a lot.
Then the pandemic as well, it just became very grueling to do website work. It was just chasing constant trends of like, people are at home, so we got to do this, we got to do that. Then everyone on that TechRadar team basically left.
They were just burnt out really because it's just knackering to work on a site during the pandemic. Basically, I just thought I was slicking my wounds. The podcast came out of that.
I forced Matthew to join me down this road essentially. But it was my baggage, it was my problems really. So I think you're very polite really to even go along with it.
Yeah, I've been polite to the tune of 200 episodes.
Do you have any insights on that Matthew? Because you were my pal the whole time, you saw me going through all of that. And it was not an easy time.
And the reason probably that the podcast exists ultimately, but I don't know.
As someone else who's gone to RPS and Reapop and was part of that business family or whatever, to see someone else come along and join it and not have a great time.
I think the interesting thing is a lot of people had some kind of creative project they spun out of the pandemic, but ours wasn't necessarily pandemic related. It just took until November for it to really happen. But we had been planning it previously.
Either way, I'm grateful that you put the time in to giving it a try.
No worries.
Who knows how much of that will trim out by the time people are listening to this. It might end up just being a very skeletal version of that story. It probably will be, to be honest, just for my own peace of mind.
But in any case, yeah, those are the weird, that's the weird sequence of events that led to the podcast basically. So here we are.
That's the story behind the story behind the podcast.
Yeah, there are no more layers of meta to explore at this point.
Well, we can. We can just keep going back until we get to our birth.
Okay, yeah, it's the creation of the universe, the Big Bang and then-
That's the Terence Malick version. A tree of life shit.
Yeah, it's the dinosaur looking sad on an iceberg or wherever. Okay, so do you remember when your genuine skepticism about the podcast subsided, Matthew? Do you remember any particular moment where you thought it was a success?
I thought it happened quite quickly, but obviously, I don't remember that clearly. I was definitely into Pears being into it, but I think once people outside of my very small Twitter social circle started listening to it, following me on social media, commenting to me on it, I found that way more satisfying. Not to do that circle down at all, like I really, really appreciated the early support from Pears, but it's easier to get a pat on the back from your friends.
And there's quite a lot of that. There's quite a lot of projects which are like buoyed by just having like a band of loyal colleagues or whatever, and for it to kind of have a bit of life outside of that and break out of that. I still have friends and work colleagues who listen to the podcast all these years on and are really supportive of it.
And that's quite nice from a professional point of view. We think, oh well, these people who I respect professionally still like it, and so that's a good sign. But when you get to the point where a group of random listeners travel to Bath to hang out with each other and we popped in to say hello, and you do have a little moment of like, oh well it's quite crazy that we sort of manifested this meeting of these random people through the podcast.
So it's probably shameful that it's not some sort of personal inner satisfaction, but the fact that it's an external people liking it and getting approval that makes it worthwhile. But that is a big motivator for me. Whether or not that's healthy or not, I don't know.
Then we sustain that with the Discord and all that. I struggle to remember the pre-Discord, pre-Patriot years a little bit.
Well, it wasn't that long really. It was like 18 months really.
That's quite a long time. I'm still really pleased that we did it that long before going down the Patreon route, and I still think that's part of its success. I think it really proved itself first.
Again, I'm not doing anyone down who does do it this way, but so many things launch Patreon first, which is just like, give us your money and trust us, which I'm never that comfortable with unless I really know the person well. I don't think we had that kind of footprints. That just wasn't on the cards for us.
I guess in terms of truly solidifying, putting a nail in any sort of skepticism coffin, the Patreon and people being willing to throw it some money every month is quite a powerful thing.
Yeah, it is. I'm very, very grateful for it. I'm grateful for the podcast for a few different reasons.
I just had a busy week before I recorded this. Then as soon as I was off, the busy-ness ended. I was like, it's really nice to have something I can just flip my focus to, and then I realized it's had a bunch more ideas in my head because I just hadn't thought about the podcast for about a week and a half.
Then it was just like, it's really easy to be able to pull this together and really satisfying to be able to pull a plan together. I agree, it's the first thing I think I've ever had peer sort of respect for or peers being actually impressed by it. I mean genuinely and not just giving you a pat on the back.
Because I think people just who I didn't really know in UK games and thought I was just one of 40 guys who look exactly like us, who worked in magazines at some point, they're just like, yeah, whatever. I didn't really think about me at all. We're like, oh yeah, I really like this thing you make.
And it's incredibly flattering when people say that. And every now and then me and Matthew will encounter someone in the wild in the games industry will tell us how much they like it. And yeah, I feel very grateful for that.
And that's what, that as much as the Patreon stuff is like, why I'm so motivated to do it. Because I like making something that people engage with, I like making something people have an opinion on. And I think at first the concern was it wouldn't fulfill any niche that wasn't already being fulfilled.
But I realized that it is giving people something very specific they want in terms of like British games journalism. Do you know what I mean? Like it's, there's some box that's ticking.
Maybe it is the whole spirit of old kind of unofficial mags thing. But something they weren't exactly getting elsewhere. So I feel, yeah, I'm enormously grateful and happy to keep doing it.
And I really did worry that by now people would be burnt out on it. But the podcast is actually in terms of Patreon pledges and about as high as it's ever been, in terms of actual listeners as well. Like it's pretty close to our all time high, where we're currently at as we're recording this.
So people still really like it and engage with it. And yeah, I'm enormously grateful. It's been really good.
Here's my other question, Matthew. Do you think it's the same podcast, Episode 200, as it was when it first started? Or has the emphasis or attitude changed at all?
I think it's mellowed a little bit. But I think that's probably part of aging over four years. Maybe just from the fact that it is a dialogue and we're in constant conversation and kind of encourages you to be a bit more polite and open to things.
Certainly for me, you know, like often when I look back on my earlier things, like NGamer or whatever, you know, while I'm really proud of it and I had such a good time doing it, there's like a strand of snotty-ness to it at times. That I'm a little bit like, that was very me, you know, 15 years ago. Likewise, with like my extreme Nintendo zealotry, that persists, but I am trying to be more well-rounded.
And I feel like while it's always be celebratory, that's, that's, but it feels like there's more and more of that as it goes on. You know, like we don't take a huge amount of pleasure in dunking on stuff. We don't do, you know, big negative dunkathon episodes.
There's a lot of comedy in absolutely shitting on things. And I've definitely played stuff which I've hated these last few years. And maybe it's cowardly to then say, well, I didn't really want to cover it because it would just be me taking big shit on something for 10 minutes and that doesn't really interest me as much anymore.
And I think that's partly tied to doing the podcast. And you feel a bit more, you know, when it's in your own voice, as in your physical voice, you feel a bit more responsible for something. Like it's kind of easier to write something and to send it off, you know, and not have to kind of answer for it as much because there's a bit of distance.
But here it's like having your own unpleasant opinion played back to you or listening back to it. It's like, oh, yikes. You know, I kind of wish I hadn't said that.
And, you know, we're even just editing the podcast. I occasionally think that was a bit rough, what I said there or, you know, I wasn't kind of into that as much. So, you know, that's like a general shift.
I hope it isn't becoming like sort of safe or fence-sitting or kind of hand-wringing. You know, I'm not really into any of that. So-
Weirdly, I think it's become less that. Well, just I think about, but not in a way that where we are like, it's not a dunk thought at all. But I thought about how the conversation we had about Echoes of Wisdom a few weeks ago, was the sort of conversation we probably wouldn't have had as much when the podcast started.
Just sort of like really granular explanation of why something works for one person but doesn't work for another. And I think that's something that we've gotten more confident at. I think we just found our critical voice in podcast form.
Yeah, that's probably right. And that's one way in which I think it's definitely evolved. And I think it actually gets people's pulses racing a bit now when we talk about new games because they like our perspective.
And when you read a magazine review, you don't get a back and forth between multiple people. But that's something the podcast can offer that you don't get from that, obviously. So, yeah, that's one way to change it.
Unless it's a bit where I was talking about the Centennial Case.
Oh, yeah, that's it. I'm actually surprised that when we do our list shortly, that you don't have... I don't see the Seven Mysteries of Honjo anywhere.
I actually... I did think of putting it on there just for... not for a joke, but as indicative of a certain strand of games.
No, that's fine. Yeah, so, yeah, I think it's changed in a few ways. So, like you say, the form of it...
We sort of created our own formats, right? And started doing those, like Gamescore and... Well, actually, that is probably the only format we've created.
The rest we did. Stole Hall of Fame and the drafts from The Ring, obviously. And we did loads of lists when we first started as well.
I think we've dialed back doing lists as much, which is good, because I think that we... In doing the best games of the different year episodes, which we will return to next year, we'll do 2004, and we'll do 2017 and 18 at some point as well, is that we ended up, I think, setting out our store quite early, if these are the things that matter to us, these are the things that shaped our game taste during these crucial years, we're working in games media. And so, if you do too many lists that crisscross, you end up repeating yourself or doing the same thing too many times.
And I'm really keen to avoid doing that, because I think it's just something you can easily do as a retro gaming podcast, which is not exactly what we are. It's like part of what we are, though. So, I didn't want to have situations where you had to talk about, well, actually, I say that you have probably talked about Mario Galaxy and why it's good about 10 plus times at this point.
But it's sort of like, rather than doing endless list episodes where the same few things come up, I think we found ways to just keep things varied, keep playing new things as well. That's one thing that's changed as well. My appetite for playing new games has spiked enormously since doing this podcast.
I like topping up my takes basically, having new things to say. You are always good at this anyway, but I think it's more formally made me conscious of, well, I have to play this and I have to make sure I understand what this is. Do you have that as well?
Does the podcast put that urge in you?
One of my most oft-repeated lines on this podcast is how thoroughly broken I am by all these years of covering games and not really being able to cover games without an objective. I have been lucky in that the work I do for a day job does involve playing a lot of games and asks me to be on top of a lot of games. But when that day job changes or those needs lessen a bit, the podcast is there to get me playing games again.
Whatever I'm doing, I can always say, well, there's a podcast episode in this. Or there's, like you say, topping up your takes. Nothing's going to go to waste, which is maybe a grim way of thinking about it.
I still can't just play things for the sake of playing them, really. But that's just me. I'm afraid that's what 16, 17 years of this does.
Yeah, that's true. Isn't it 18 years? Didn't you just pass the 18 years?
Yes, I always forget the 18 years since I joined NGamer.
That's crazy that you could have raised an adult in the time that you were working that whole time.
Yeah, maybe I should have done that instead.
Well, I'm about to hit the same anniversary in March as well. Because I'm 36, that's literally half my lifetime. I say that, but I haven't been working in games media for now for five years.
So it's not really, I feel like in my head there's continuity, but there's not really. I'm just sort of, I've ambiently existed around UK games media that whole time, I guess. But yeah, so I agree.
There is definitely nothing goes to wasting. I stopped playing live service games as much after we started the podcast. That's a good thing, I think.
I just seeking out more varied experiences. Destiny and playing through all those raids is very much like a pandemic era concern. I do wish I could see some of the raids I've not done in Destiny, because I was thinking about what magnificent clockwork creations those are and how it might be nice.
That's just life, though, isn't it? Getting older, looking back and thinking, and all the raids not taken.
Very good, Matthew. My last question, before we get to our list of, I haven't actually explained what this episode is, because it's called Episode 200, Behind The Back Page. I realize people don't know what we're actually doing in this bit, other than me telling stories that are making me do that.
Shake, you know, the kind of like vibrating head emoji. That's like me after telling the story of like 2019 to present, basically. Who knows how much I've redacted though, so I don't know.
But-
There's so much theoretical in this episode. This is very much like the Schrodinger's Cat of podcast episodes. We haven't recorded yet.
It may either be good or bad. We literally don't know until someone opens the drawer.
What do you think the next 200 episodes will hold, Matthew, if we get that far?
Fucking hell. That's another thing. Will I be alive in 200 episodes?
I definitely have to just start doing some exercise. That's like a bleak truth, but not until my toes healed. So right now, I'm just like snacking like a bastard, just wolfing things down.
Some new formats, I'm hoping.
That'd be good.
I'd be less reliant on Games Court. Games Court, it will sour at some point. I'm amazed it hasn't happened already.
Yeah, but we've put massive gaps between the episodes. That's why. There's like six months now between Games Courts.
Yeah, I'm always nervous about any of the episodes where it's sort of quote unquote funny. But people seem to give them a pass.
People love it.
Yeah, that's fine. Well, we'll see. We've just started the era of the multi-person drafts or the redrafts.
I think that could be a lot of fun. I was going to say lucrative, which is pressing way of thinking about it. But that could be jolly.
There's definitely some stuff I want to go back in. I think drafting with people kind of reveals as much about the platform as the person. It's actually quite an interesting exercise to kind of get a sense of someone.
We learned about Dave's emotional Spider-Man connection, for example, Miles Morales, which was very winning. So yeah, I think people, they lay it all out when they draft, which I like.
It reminds me of the time that my mum had a tummy ache when I played Glover on N64. There's a lot of that in our future.
But an opportunity to get some old favorites back on. I really enjoyed the episode we did with Jay about Japanese games. And however you'd categorize the episode, it would be great if we could do all of those kind of sort of topic discussions, I guess.
Not quite industry commentary. It's something a little bit more wide reaching than that.
Yeah, yeah. I also, I really loved the episode we did with Jamie about the developer, his developing past and like the developer, developer tricks and developer quandaries. I'd love to get him back on at some point and dig more into other behind the scenes things.
Yeah, okay.
I mean, that won't fill 200 episodes.
No, that's fine. There'll be a few mail bags in there, I'm sure.
Oh yeah, some mail bags, some what we've been playing. Like, due to change of job, like I hope I have a bit more like game playing time to do some deep dives again. I know we've been talking about maybe Tomb Raider.
Tomb Raider and Gears of War.
Yeah, which I think those would be really good. You know, at some point we'll tackle Mario in some form. Maybe split the 2D, 3D Marios.
Yeah, I mean, it's probably a 3D one next year, isn't it? With the Switch 2 launch, I would imagine.
Yeah, we hope so. Yeah, the Metroid Deep Dive.
Oh yeah, that is definitely one. But that's one that Jake can come on as well, actually. He's played every single one of those games and has some thoughts on those.
That would be good. Yeah, I would like to do more of those too. I've got the weird feeling next year we'll be a bit quieter for games.
I think it's sort of like, I saw an article this week trying to dial up, oh, there's loads coming, it's like Monster Hunter, blah, blah, blah. And like, there's definitely a few big things coming next year. But then I think there will be a certain point where it's actually going to be a quieter year.
We are due a quieter year of blockbusters, I think. And even this year, like a few things just ended up shifting at the last second, and it's not been quite as busy an end of year period as it otherwise might be. So yeah, I think we'll have a bit more capacity for that next year.
Whether we'll get to all those, I'm not sure, we might just do one or two of them. Hard to tell when that next Tomb Raider game is coming along. I think that could end up being the year after, who knows?
Maybe we'll revisit James Bond games, Matthew, and that we finally learn more about that from IO. Yeah, there's that, I think, in the future. Like Matthew says, I would like to experiment with more formats for episodes.
I think the J episode was good because the topic-based thing, you can potentially do with so many different things, and we already have a second episode with J in that style that we are planning for November. In fact, people probably already know what it is, by the time that they're listening to this. So yeah, I will definitely give that some more thought.
I'm curious, which consoles would you like to redraft, Matthew? Is there anything in particular you've got the appetite to go back and talk about?
It's just fun going back in once you've established your drafting relationship with the previous episodes. Obviously, I'm on firmer grounds with Nintendo.
N64?
Yeah, N64. It's more about trying to stretch the library of DS, perhaps.
Yeah.
That would speak to me.
Did we do like 20 picks or something ridiculous for that when we did that? It was a larger draft because there's so many games.
The Vita one was huge.
Yeah. That was like five PSP picks alongside the- That may have been conceptually flawed when I look back on it.
I'm not sure the Vita's got enough games for a redraft necessarily. But what about Wii? Think Wii's got it?
I don't know.
You have to get someone who gets the Wii. A lot of people have quite a shallow relationship with it if they weren't really in the trenches covering it.
Ash Day. Ash Day will get it.
Yeah. That would be good, actually.
That'd be good. I think we're coming up to like four years since we did some of those drafts as well, because those drafts started in 2021. So I think PS2 was first that we did.
Yeah.
So yeah, that will be redrafted at some point, and that will be redrafted with two people. We just need to figure that out. 360 redraft would be good.
That's probably a little bit less of a rush on that one, because it doesn't feel like it was that long ago since we did the first draft. 90s PC gaming. I think we can redo that with Jeremy Peel.
We could probably do noughties again with Jeremy Peel as well. Yeah. I think so you got all that ahead.
Honestly, I thought I would run out of episode ideas by now, but I haven't really struggled for it. There's always more guests we still want to get on as well. There's still about 10 to 15 people I'm still dying to get on the podcast, people I used to work with, people Matthew used to work with.
It's just a slow process of trying to get them. One guest we really wanted for this episode turned us down. That was kind of gutting, but what can you do?
That is their right to do that, so fair enough. But yeah, lots ahead and don't worry, I'll still make Matthew do Games Court, much to his chagrin. Matthew, shall we take a quick break and then come back with our games that we're discussing in this episode?
Yes.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, in this section, we're gonna talk about some of our favorite games we've played since the podcast started. This is a little bit of a, seems like a bit of a vague kind of description of what we're talking about, I guess, but because the podcast comprises new games and old games we've discussed over the years, I kind of see them almost as like markers of like moments in time that represent a certain like era of the podcast, so just remind you fondly of recording it at that point.
And we have enough distance from, you know, the start of the podcast life now that I do actually have a little bit of nostalgia for the things we did play at certain points. So, yeah, it's an interesting, it's interesting in that respect, but yeah, it's just also quite shocking that some of the games are talking about like three years old, for example, that too is quite upsetting. But yeah, I think it will make sense when you hear it.
It's a mix of old and new and some favourites we talked about probably in the recent past and some we haven't discussed for quite a long time. Yeah, it's a good old mix, Matthew. So why don't we start with you?
Yes. So yeah, I kind of tackled this for like favourite games slash things that were like quite meaningful to, when I think of the podcast, I think of these games. Yeah, that makes sense.
So the first one, the most obvious thing in the world, well, I've put it down as Hitman World of Assassination. This is what the Hitman trilogy is now known as, but I'm probably talking about Hitman 3, which came out early in 2021, and was a game both of us were into. We've done a lot of Hitman content on the podcast.
We've ranked the levels twice, unnecessarily so, you be the judge.
I like coming up with the fake Hitman levels ourselves.
Oh, that was really good.
Yeah, it was fun.
I think the podcast is like a quietly like excellent strand is like imagine a thing, but it's in Bath or it has us in it.
Yeah, the Bath Christmas Lights one really stays with me. That's a great, that's great. Yeah, also like Hitman, I weirdly associate that with the early part of the podcast life more than the recent past, just because Hitman is subsided a bit.
I think we enshrined it as like an important game in the early episodes. So it almost doesn't need to be said. I think why it's in a way, I think of it as the perfect back page game, in that it's a series which has basically been around the whole period that we cover on this podcast.
So from our teenage years forward, there's always been Hitman. We've always been into it. It's arguably in its best form now, and the form it's ended up in, there's so much variety to it, and so many different approaches to it.
It's so generous. It's got a weird sense of humour, but also a great design sensibility. It exists in that quite filmic space.
I think it speaks to a lot of our pop culture interests. I think unlike a Venn diagram of just all our shit, Hitman, The World of Assassination is just somehow like bang in the middle.
Yeah, it's very true. It does just reward everything that I think we think is important in terms of like the presentation is extraordinary. It's really funny at times.
It's really creative and the sense of place in all of these environments is incredible. Over the years, the way they packaged it into this trilogy of just all these very dense levels back to back, it's the best deal in the history of video games really, that you can get all these levels for something like probably about 30 quid to get all of it if you buy the DLC levels as well. You can't argue with that.
It's one of the most wonderful packages to just discover in games. Even though it started like eight years ago, games haven't gotten any better looking since then really. So it's still to play now.
Art design is just so spot on that they can add shinier passes to it, but it will always be rock solid at its core. If you are into making lists, which we are, it's just so great for that. You can argue about it.
It is a little bit like the James Bond of video games in that podcasters of a certain character can just lose themselves in it forever. Maybe a bit of an eye roll if you are outside of that group. But if you're inside, like I will always want to hear a Hitman level ranking.
I'm always up for it. I just saw one yesterday actually, they were doing the rounds, I think Josh Sawyer of Obsidian fame had put out his top 10 Hitman levels from Blood Money and the New Trilogy.
No Hokkaido, Matthew.
No Hokkaido. I got cross about it and I was sitting here about it for like 10 minutes. I didn't put any justification, he just listed 10 things.
I was sitting there with the sofa fuming at the bullshit of no Hokkaido. And like, oh, lo and behold, what's number one? Was it Sapienza?
That's original.
And then Colorado was in his top 10 as well. That's mad. Again, no ill will towards Josh Sawyer whatsoever here.
Simply his Hitman level choices were...
I mean, Colorado, I mean, that is... I would love to hear the justification for that.
Well, I think it's... I never really forced myself to go back and play loads of Colorado after doing it the first time. Like I did all the different sort of like event kills basically, the little...
and then after that I didn't really... I never tried to do any Colorado revisionism, you know?
Yeah, I don't know. Like is Colorado the alien three of Hitman?
Let's not let it get to that point. As a society, nip that in the bud and say, no, I will not accept that. I will not have blokes going, I think Colorado is actually the best one.
I don't know why the Northern accent there, I do apologize. But there's no particular commentary in me doing that. But no, we can't allow that to happen, even with the cool shooting the Scarecrow supernatural, was it the bells?
That's the bells, isn't it? And then something supernatural happens.
The bells sap it into and then the cracking comes out of the scene.
That is fucking cool. Yeah. But it's sort of like, yeah, even that Easter egg for Colorado cannot make it good.
But I agree, Bond movies is a good comparison, I think. Yeah. Except I'm not sure there are more than five great Bond movies, and there are definitely more than five great Hitman, World of Assassination levels.
So, but hey, we talked about that enough. Yeah, I love Hitman 2. I sort of, I think that my deepest dive with it was in late 2018 when Hitman 2 came out.
That's when I played, I rinsed those levels back to back. But I did enjoy revisiting them for that Excel episode. And it is always like fun to discuss.
And I can't think of, yeah, like a sort of a better use of 100 hours than just like living in those levels for a while. It's still one of the best experiences in games for sure. Okay, Matthew, my first pick then is Yakuza Zero, which I played in 2021 around the time that Phil came on and did that excellent Yakuza episode with us.
I should find another excuse to get Phil on and that doesn't have him explaining Destiny Guns to me. He used to love making podcasts for Phil, so I'll find a reason to get him on again at some point. So yeah, this was interesting because I was one of the OG Yakuza owners on PS2.
I had that version that had Michael Rosenbaum from Smallville and Mark Hamill in the voice cast, and I thought it was a very mediocre game. Even if you take the localization stuff out of it, I don't think there's a lot to love. I actually think that Yakuza Zero is...
No one really wants to say it, but the original Yakuza is not very good, and it's not even very good in its Kiwami form. It's a very basic beat-em-up with a bunch of story stuff that happens in between. Like the side content is not particularly substantial in the original Yakuza either, but the side content is what brings Yakuza Zero to life.
I actually had to really... I mean, it took me 15 years to get to the point where I was ready to try again and be like, well, maybe there is something to this game, and maybe I have just been too cynical about this series, because a lot of people just adopted this as their cult hit game of choice, and I just thought, well, I played the original and it wasn't much cop, and the combat is still exactly the same, so what can change? The answer is that the character of it has expanded so much in terms of the side quests and the different situations you find yourself in.
The tonal range of the storytelling, Yakuza Zero has got a lot more in terms of funny sections and touching sections. I would say the original is quite a conventional gangster narrative. It's a kind of like fall and rise story.
The fact that it's set in Japan is, I guess, an interesting wrinkle to it, but the actual beats of the original Yakuza story are not that surprising as a friend who betrays you, there's going to prison, taking the fall for something, then there's coming back and assimilating and rising again, and then it's all very conventional stuff. Yakuza 0 is much more like, oh, we were best pals in the 80s, and oh, there's just loads of fucking money. It's a good money times in Japan, and here's fucking Mr. Shakedown walking around.
You just realize that all those wrinkles are what make it spectacular and what they've leaned into more and more as the series has gone on. So just to discover that fresh during lockdown, you couldn't go anywhere, it was really, really cool. I really love this game, Matthew, and I don't remember when did Yakuza happen for you?
Do you remember?
Oh, yeah, it's kind of, it's a start. So I definitely played Yakuza PS2 Yakuza. I owned that way back when, you know, so pre-played that whenever I came, what, 2007 was that?
2006?
Six, I think it was six.
Yeah, and then it's, I dipped in again on, I want to say Yakuza 4 was the one, like randomly on PS3 and felt like, oh, I had a great time with it, but I was missing loads of stuff and I'd come in on the middle of this big soap opera. Then I just started absorbing it via osmosis. And yeah, definitely Yakuza 0 is the one which kind of gets me in in a big way.
When it came to PC, that's really when I played it during the RPS years. And since then, you know, I've been quite sort of religious about, you know, the newer ones, you know, which I've played all absolutely, you know, to destruction. And going back by playing Yakuza 1 and 2, Kiwami, yeah, still got gaps to fill in for sure.
3, 4 and 5, have you done those?
No, no. If I have, I definitely haven't finished them. You know, I have, like, little weird memories from different games where I'm like, well, I must have played some of this because I know some of this stuff.
But yeah, the recent run of, yeah, the mainline Yakuza games, Like a Dragon, Judgment, this has just been a huge part of my gaming diet for the last five years. And they're absolutely massive games. So they always eat up like a considerable amount of the year.
And just Headspace, I think it's just a really elegant way of stretching not a lot quite far. They know where to dial things up to make sure the story lands, and where that they can skimp a little bit in the name of quite abstract humor. The fact that not everything has to be fully voiced if the scenario is funny enough, or they're happy to just reuse some like, well, we made a monkey for this scene, so in this set piece, the same monkey steals a digger, and they're like, yeah, why not?
We'll just put these two things together. And I actually think, you know, I don't want to call it cost-cutting, but that efficiency has lent it such a specific character. And it's a character with so much like humor and warmth and creativity.
Yeah, I just love how much of it they've made, you know, to be a fan of this thing is just so rewarding, just so much of it, and it is all pretty great. Yeah, like I just, yeah, I wish, I wish, you know, fans of all the series wish they could be so lucky, you know.
It's one of those great video game success stories. And it's just played out kind of in parallel to Atlas' success as well. So you just suddenly have this, I mean, they're both owned by Sega, but like this, yeah, this, I guess, like not even like really related, but hardcore series that or like overall franchises that are just serving this audience so, so well with this stuff.
And they're also showing that you don't bank breaking production values to get an audience really excited and to reach like a large number of people. And so, yes, one day I will get to the more recent entries in this series. I just need things to stop fucking coming out for maybe three months and I can play play through 2020 like a dragon.
Then this year's one, which everyone seems to suggest is a game of the year contender. So I should get to that at some point, Matthew. What's your next game?
My next game is everyone's favorite. It's 4 to 8 Shibuya Scramble, which I played in 2021, I think, but came to PlayStation a few years before that. Maybe 2017 was a Wii game, an early Wii game that famously scored 40 out of 40 for Mitsu, but was never translated.
Probably understandably so. It's a vast visual novel with millions of words. Probably a bit of a gamble back in 2006.
I think there was maybe less appetite for it, but I think that appetite definitely exists now. I picked this because, A, it's a game I played while we were doing the podcast, and I feel like it's come up on the podcast quite a lot. I've tried to kind of champion it, and I guess it represents that corner of the podcast where we are able to kind of indulge ourselves and endlessly bang on about something incredibly niche with absolutely no indicator whether or not it's ever landing.
But I like that I have a kind of soapbox to chat about this game from, and I will keep selecting it for drafts even though literally no one ever cares. And the only feedback I ever get is like, oh, I don't even know what that is, so I'm just not interested in it. Rather than, oh, I'll take your recommendation and play that game.
That's not true. I think there's a real strand of Matthew Castle favorites that a bunch of our listeners quite vocal check out.
Maybe. I'm feeling quite wounded on this one because I feel like this is the one which hasn't broken through, which is maybe why I picked it over, you know, talking about like Hotel Dusk again, or Ghost Trick or something like that. I feel like this is the one which, you know, if you trust me on anything, trust me, like this is way better than Hotel Dusk.
Like, this is genuinely amazing. Well, Hotel Dusk is meaningful and I really like it. But I wouldn't say it's anyway near as good or interesting as this.
This is better than The Centennial Case. This is better than Paranormal Sight. You know, it is, you know, of that kind of ilk of games, I guess.
The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, Matthew.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I should say it's one of my favorite games just from what we discussed over the years for that one joke.
Yeah, I just like saying it. But yeah, I wanted to include it as that kind of tier of of lesser known things that we're able to champion. I didn't mean to come across too sour that it doesn't ever win me any draft picks.
I know what I'm doing when I pick it.
But you were close to winning that PS4 draft.
There was an initial surge. Once the lists went up, I feel like I quickly pulled back into third place.
Yeah. The weird thing is that Dave picked Bloodborne, obviously, and ruined the draft, at least at first. I'm only joking, of course, but we both gave him shit for it.
He was number one at first, and then Dave took over and was dominant. Then the lists went up and then I suddenly surged quite a lot, which made me wonder if the overall 10 that I picked was the winner there. But I also don't think that the reason you lost the draft was because you picked this.
I think that was like-
No, no.
Everyone had at least one game where they either whiffed it or picked something that wasn't quite as tasty as the other things on the list.
Yeah. 428 Shabir Scramble is much better than Bloodborne. I genuinely think that.
I would never play Bloodborne again. This I will absolutely return to. I have way more respect for people who can see the quality in this than Bloodborne.
But unfortunately, that's the lot of the souls not enjoy in the 21st century.
Did you consider putting Elden Ring on your list, by the way? Because I did think about it. It was a very fun 24 hours playing that game.
I just didn't finish it at all.
No, because I think if I really enjoyed it and I had true fun, I would have played more of it and I didn't.
Yeah, that's true.
I just got to a point where I was like, I was in the land which is all pink and plague and full of giant dogs. I just thought it was really shit, that area and I was like, nope, no more. Whereas 428 should be a scramble, unless you play as a freelance journalist, running around Japan having crazy hijinks in a very busy day.
It's one of the truly hilarious video games, one of the very few genuinely funny video games. Yeah, I've hijacked this episode to try and get another one person to play it.
Yeah, I did buy off the back of your recommendation, I think on PS4. At some point, maybe I should. Why don't we do a game swap, Matthew?
I think that's something we're talking about.
It's huge, it's big though.
Yeah, that's the problem with all of these visual novels. With the exception of maybe a few of the indie ones, they all end up being fucking 25 hours plus.
Yeah, but then you can, if you enjoy them, you'd enjoy a good book.
That's true.
Do you enjoy a good book?
All my books have Batman in them.
Yes.
That's not true. I'm probably on a bit of a cold streak of reading like five novels a year at the moment. It's not many, I'll be honest, and I know you get through a lot more than that.
Although all yours are like blokes who have been killed in novelty houses in Asia. So like, which is fine, but I'm just saying. Okay, good.
Well, I like you talking about that still, Matthew, and I never try and like dismiss the things you talk about as well. Because there are definitely areas of games you have an interest in where I just simply do not have the same passion. But that's what we do in this podcast.
We hear out each other's bullshit. So yeah. Okay.
My second game that I picked is Deathloop, which I played in 2021. I picked this because this generation, I still don't think any game on the newer consoles has got me more excited about those consoles than this game did at that moment. It's that thing of like, it was a blockbuster that just does something that no other blockbuster did.
It was like it dared to have this unusual structure of it feeling like there were like a million pieces in front of you and you were trying to figure out exactly how to get to the one solution of how you kill all of these different targets in one day, basically. And I think once you reach the solution, it's fairly straightforward how you do it, even though I think the finale of it is quite spectacular. But it just felt fresh in a way that blockbusters just haven't for me this generation at all.
Like, it's been a very, like... Genres that were established as being big hitters on PS3 and then became, like, you know, massive deals and more polished on PS4 are still the genres that dominate. A first-person immersive sim slash stealth game slash FPS, you know, however you want to play it, basically.
Just with this kind of structure is just so novel with the invasion element. And just like the idea of it being invaded by the players and having to fend them off and adding this sense of unknowable sort of danger to it. Really exciting, this unusual kind of back and forth between the two characters as well, constantly talking over radio comms, great voice acting, amazing style to it as well.
Just like the sort of posters and the fashion and things like that. Just a true original, this generation. And just one of the few games I've actually reviewed in the last like 10 years, really.
I haven't done many of them. Just really got deep into it, played it for loads of time, thought it was really cool. Yeah, well, what do you think of this pic, Matthew?
Yeah, I really like this. I think you liked it a little more than me, but I definitely associate it with the podcast as one of the bigger releases that came out while we were doing the podcast. Yeah.
And our first attempt at covering a big game release and both playing it and talking it through. And yeah, I've got a game from a similar period on my list for similar reasons, really. And that it just makes me, you know, it makes me think of a particular period of the podcast.
And, you know, it's that early run of a console, The Next Generation, where they all seem very exotic. And, you know, everyone's trying to use all the features. This used the PS5 DualSense with all the speaker and the haptics inside to kind of mimic the ammo in your guns and things like that.
It's just that kind of honeymoon period is always really good fun. Like, it's a period of, like, I always look back very fondly on my magazine years, you know, of just that early kind of promise of a machine. I think it also factors into it.
It's like, yeah, this is, I agree, that honeymoon period. This kind of sums it up quite nicely. What's your next game, Matthew?
My next game is, well, I've bundled together Final Fantasy VII OG, Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. As a general, I discovered Final Fantasy VII, or I finally got to grips with Final Fantasy VII and the wider Final Fantasy VII projects during the podcast years. Primarily-
This was nice to see play out from my perspective. I enjoyed it.
Yeah, it was fun. You know, again, I only played a little bit of, you know, years and years ago, but had absorbed so many takes via osmosis that I almost felt like I kind of knew it and hadn't played it and needed a good reason to play it. This podcast gave me a good one.
I really enjoyed the episode where we talked through Disc 1. I haven't finished Final Fantasy VII. I've played a little bit into Disc 2 for the inevitable two giant men played Disc 2 of Final Fantasy VII, whether that will be tied to the next chunk of the re-
you know, the last chunk of the remake, I don't know. But yeah, just finally getting to grips with it and seeing what there was outside of the kind of couple of beats or stretches of the game, which I think kind of define or dominate a lot of the conversation. You know, to talk about this game or to have read about this game for the last 20 years, there's like a lot of Midgar chat and a lot of Sephiroth chat and a lot of Eris Dying chat.
And you're like, that's fine, but there's like so much beyond that. And discovering that was a real treat both in the OG and in the two remakes, which I think I ended up liking a fair bit more than you, weirdly, given that you have a much longer relationship with this series, isn't really the outcome I was expecting.
Yeah.
But I think that's less to do with nostalgia and what these games mean to people and more that what they are doing with the remakes outside of their relationship with the original game is just so overblown and maximalist in a way that I quite like and speaks to a lot of my tastes. What I like about Rebirth isn't necessarily that it's a clever redo of Final Fantasy VII, but that it is just one of the most excessive things ever made. For what it is, that really speaks to me like the mad lush soundtrack and I didn't hate the thousands of minigames and the fact they've taken a 10-hour stretch of game and turned it into 100 hours or whatever preposterous stat is.
I'm kind of into the madness of it.
Yeah. It was cool to see you go on this little journey, but you're right that my relationship to FF7 is very different to yours. I mean, the peak of my interest in FF7 was when Advent Children came out, which was a long, long time ago now.
That was 06, I think, and at that point they had like... They were doing the compilation of FF7 spin-offs and stuff, but the difference is they were taking it really seriously. They were taking FF7 as this really serious bit of fiction and all this sort of stuff, but I think that the remakes weirdly embrace the campier, cittier sides of the game, which are absolutely as key to it as the more dramatic moments that maybe set the tone of Advent Children as being like, yeah, everyone's got a disease and we're all a bit fucked basically and the environment is screwed.
I think there's a better tonal balance in the remakes. I find them hard to love and I can't quite pinpoint why. I wonder if it is because I just, like I say, I did get FF7 out my system a little bit.
But I too appreciate the maximalist approach to those games. I do think that a lot of the stuff in Rebirth comes off as a little bit superfluous, but there's no arguing with the fact that those open-world environments look fantastic, and coming across locations, you remember even minor locations and seeing them blown out with loads of people around. I mean, the opening area of like Calm just looks fucking incredible.
Calm was such a non-entity of a town in my head. It was just like the joke I always made was, why would you live in Midgar when you can commute from Calm? It's like a pretty average gag, but I like to wheel it out for a tweet every five or six years.
Yeah, they just turned it into like, I feel like I'm in Disneyland right now. I feel like I'm in a themed area in Disneyland. There's so much going on.
There's a fucking Shinra airship up there. I know when I walk outside the town, I can see the town at full scale from the open world. I love that about it.
It's actually probably, quietly the most next-gen thing there is, FF7 Rebirth. It's sort of like other than maybe-
It's definitely up there, for sure.
Yeah, yeah, the production values are probably too excessive. They were probably expecting it to sell many more copies than it did. But I can't argue with, for the asking price of 50 quid, you get fucking loads and loads of game for your money.
Yeah, that's what I'm all about.
So yeah, I think it's because I've got a personal want to see Final Fantasy be on top when it comes to original games again, like I really like 16, but I want Final Fantasy to be the king of RPGs again. I really believe in that. And I think that personally, I would like to see that future happen in like original games rather than remakes.
But I wanted this game for so long. And when it arrived, I'm just being an ungrateful motherfucker about it, just because I'm a lot grayer and heavier than I thought I would be when a remake was going to roll along. But alas, I'm really glad you discovered these, Matthew.
It's cool. Okay. So my next game, this is a bit unexpected because it wasn't on the top of my list of the year it came out.
But I picked Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, which I played in 2021 and then going into 2022 as well. I didn't finish it in time for that Game of the Year episode. I in my head have these little boxes of pandemic era content that I'm quite fond of because it somehow mirrors the time a little bit or there's something about it, that it being quite poignant or its themes tying into the headspace the pandemic put you into somehow.
I think that weirdly this game does that. But there's actually a couple of reasons I've picked this. One, I really like the story of this game and it came along at a time where I couldn't have been less interested in Marvel really.
It was after Black Widow came out and our beloved Eternals, Matthew and Shang-Chi, which I really didn't like. I just wasn't really feeling it. But this game fights the fact that you have Chris Pratt and Dave Batista and all those actors in your head.
It has to fight that, it has to give you new versions of the characters to love. It succeeds at doing that. It's not exactly the same take even though I think it comes from a similar spiritual place.
But it just makes those characters so endearing. It makes the Milano, the ship that they're on, just feel like this real space that all these people have to share. And so you get this, the interplay, the back and forth between those characters really just brings them to life as a team.
And like gives it a greater layer than I think the films have, which is this very novelty, well hey, wacky space guys kind of stuff. And occasionally some dad issues. And just, you know, I think by the time the third one came out, I was a little bit burned out on that.
And then weirdly played this game and thought, oh, these game developers up in Canada are doing a better job than James Gunn. And I don't, that's crazy. That just seems so unlikely to me as a thing because people were so skeptical about this game.
They had one bad trailer and people used it to kick the game until it came out. And then it came along and this, because Naughty Dog has not made a game this generation, this is the best Uncharted style experience of this generation in my opinion. I don't think there's another game that ticks these box in the same way of like third person quip set pieces, gets the blood pumping, really exciting, like funny.
It's just, it doesn't quite have the stuff when it comes to combat. It's a pretty, pretty samey kind of combat experience, but it's still, it's still pretty fun. It's like a really solid eight that would probably give like an 8.5 or something.
I just think that this is, this really deserved to do better than it did. And yeah, I think it's sort of like, it's the themes of its story, how it explores loss, I thought was pretty nicely done for a game that is based on, you know, on these characters. What do you think of this pick, Matthew?
I definitely see all that. I think it's one of those, like, like you say, you sometimes get these, like, eight out of ten. So you know in your heart, or your brain, that it's an eight out of ten.
But it comes on at the right time, or it surprises you in the right way, or it, you know, what it does get right isn't necessarily what you expected to get right. And because of that, it ends up meaning a bit more, you know? And you kind of carry it with you, and you always look back on it, and you're like, you know, if I was to redo my Games of the Year that list, you wouldn't put it, probably wouldn't put it higher than you did, but it's the kind of perfect game for a list like this, you know, it sort of has resonance, and it was meaningful, and I would take like an uneven surprise over like a quality, sort of something I expected to be quality, you know?
Yeah, definitely, and it is a bummer that it's like, Todd, with slightly the same brush as like the Avengers game, kind of, you know, these aren't the proper Marvel things, and so people aren't interested, and you're like, well, more for you, this has got a lot of interesting stuff going on in it.
Yeah, Avengers is a really key part of the narrative of this game, actually, I forgot about that, it's like, just because that stank out the joint, I think it just made it harder for things to spread.
Well, that's it, and you're like, oh, it's exactly the same as that, it's the knockoff things, it doesn't look as right, so it will be a bit wrong, and even the Avengers had like some stuff going for it that people didn't give it credit for, and it wasn't good, I don't think, but it had some moments.
Three or four great scripted story missions, that's what the whole game should have been, because those were really good. And yes, the character designs were a bit off, but the animations were phenomenal.
Yeah, yeah.
So yeah, but I agree, just if you, the universe, I'd love to see the universe where this goes first and Avengers go second, and just see if it maybe plays out differently. Yeah, Eidos Montreal, all-timer studio that never gets the credit it deserves, like those Deus Ex games never like were like blockbusters, never sold like well enough. They, this didn't sell well enough, so they, and then they were making a Deus Ex that was cancelled, like fucking give that studio a break.
They're so good. They've made so much good shit over the years. So yes, feel strongly about this one.
And it's always on sale. I'm sure at some point they'll take it off sale. So when it's like 10 quid, definitely hoover it up.
What's the next pick Matthew?
Well, I believe you've also got this on your list. I've got God of War 3.
Haha, yes, I love it. God of War 3.
Which I had played before, but I replayed in 2022 when we were doing our God of War ranking episodes. And I think I picked this one as it's the perfect example of a game which I kind of reassessed, re-evaluated a bit on replaying it. Like I had an idea of it and I thought it was sort of, it was sort of fine in my head what I remembered.
You know, like, I think people are hoping for some absolute, like, 10 out of 10 PS3 exclusive. Like there was a lot of weight on God of War going into that generation. And it didn't quite deliver that, although it didn't feel like there was as much excitement around God of War 3 at the time.
And I kind of played it and thought, yeah, that was fine. And replaying it, I think, I just appreciated, like, how coherent it is as a journey. Like, I think it is one of the great, like, 10-hour campaigns in terms of, like, the amount of stuff you chew through, the size of it.
But also, the... I don't think I ever really got the whole, as he's killing the gods, he's kind of, like, dooming the world and the momentum of that journey up the mountain and the idea that you're just, like, dragging everything to hell with you, which is, like, such a clichÃ© in, like, epic blockbuster filmmaking, storytelling, game making, whatever. But this game, I think, actually really does deliver on this, on quite a cartoony version of it.
But that kind of wowed me a bit, was this sense of, oh, well, it is just this stupid, like, hack and slash action game, but there's, there's, like, real, like, artistic intent behind it, and I think it really delivers on it. Maybe I appreciated it a bit more in light of newer God of War being, like, a bit better behaved, a bit more polite, kind of reckoning with slightly different things, thinking about Kratos as this, like, real psychological being, and actually I enjoyed spending time with this sort of simpler version again. But for whatever reason, it just really landed for me that time.
And, you know, I know it's a bit of a problematic game, and some people think it's, like, a bit a bit mucky and sort of, like, you know, unpleasant in a kind of teenage minded way. But I do think there's there's, like, real heft to it. I think it's great.
Yeah, absolutely. It's like a problematic 70s movie or something that you like. This is amazing, but it was directed by Roman Polanski or whatever, you know, like it's, it's like, it's just, yeah, it's got, it's got that sort of vibe to it.
It's, like you say, there's something about discovering it now when you've played the better behaved God of War's and it, like, really busting the cobwebs. In fact, I remember in Nathan Brown's Hit Points newsletter, he had the similar experience of not really getting on with Ragnarok and then going back and playing this. And then, yeah, you like beat a god to death in the first, like, 10 minutes of the game.
And it's like, it's such a different beast. And, yeah, like, the baggage I had at the time was the PS3 was struggling and everything it had needed to be massively significant. There needs to be this generational leap from PS2.
And gameplay wise, there isn't really a generational leap. There is a graphics leap. But it is the best version of the type of experience they had on PS2.
It definitely, yeah, for whatever reason, just I think it's sort above 1 and 2 by just having these grand narrative stakes and the feeling that everything around you was mega fucked. And it's actually like a tone. You just don't really, a nihilistic tone, you don't really encounter in blockbuster games very often.
So it does stand out. And yeah, I actually do also think that the way that God of War 2018 reckons with the events of this game, actually they oddly enhance each other. You know, they just, it's like, yeah, there's an exchanged kind of significance there.
I can't quite explain it. You just have to play them both and they are, they weirdly work incredibly well as a pair. So yeah, I agree.
This was such an exciting thing to discover. I never thought this was gonna be a good game. I thought I'd play it and be like, oh yeah, more God of War.
Because that's how I started to feel about like, you know, Ghost of Sparta, for example. It's like, I know what this does. I know how this behaves.
But yeah, it's disruptive, as the kids say, Matthew. Yeah, good stuff. Okay, so yeah, that was one of mine as well.
My next one is definitely not one of Matthew's. This is Sonic CD, played in 2021. So I put this down because I did, I've got a lot of 2021 games, actually.
And I think that's because in the first year, we definitely like blew through a lot of ideas that I really wanted to do. Or this is when I just started changing how I was playing games in order to facilitate episodes of the podcast. So I played through all the 2D Sonics, the way, let me rephrase that, the non-game gear 2D Sonics to do the episode with Jay, the best Sonic games episode, which was a lot of fun.
And Sonic CD is the one that was probably the biggest revelation because such an unusual game in that series. Sonic 3 is technically a better game in terms of level design and stuff. But Sonic CD's music and style is just quite wild and cool and night clubby in this way that the rest of the series isn't.
You can almost imagine this future where Sonic becomes like these, like when you see the weird synth wave backgrounds you see on YouTube, when you put on an hour long playlist of just a bunch of music. Weirdly, Sonic CD gets closer to that aesthetic than any other game in the series. I always wish they had gone down that direction than the fucking Big the Cat, Cream the Rabbit, Oak Cutesy, Character Overload.
Side note, the original Sonic Adventure, one of the five worst games I've played since doing this podcast. This had such a massive impact on the outside of it as well. I got to the end of 2021 and because of Yakuza 0 and Sonic CD, I think the Sega sound team was my most listened to artist on Spotify.
There was a point where Sam Robson who worked at Future, someone I worked and really liked, just came up to my desk and went, did I just see you listening to Sonic music on Spotify? I just saw the thumbnail and I was like, yeah, that's the thing that's happened to me this year, proper deranged pandemic behavior. Yeah, enjoy playing this.
I can't remember what if you'd ever played this one Matthew, but I know how you feel about Sonic.
So yeah, no, not really. But you know, I wish you well. And I'm glad that you had, you know, a good time.
Like the Spotify thing, I completely understand. Like I've had so many like phases of things with this podcast where I've listened to things on Spotify, which then when I get my my review of the year, it's got some absolutely baffling shit on it. Like when we were doing the Ace Attorney episode, I made a playlist of just the pursuit themed from all the different Ace Attorneys.
Yeah. And listen to that endlessly. So yeah, like Capcom's sound team is always like super high in my list of of things I've listened to.
Do you want to know why? The worst thing that I've listened to a lot of because of this podcast.
Oh, go on.
The Paul McCartney song from Destiny.
What?
What? Yeah, I listen to that all the time on YouTube. I really like that song.
OK, I'm so confused by that. You've got to be the only person who who likes that.
I like the music video is so shit as well, because it's that holographic Paul McCartney over like what looks like quite budget Destiny footage of like we just turned off the HUD and then and then like zoomed out the camera a bit. And he doesn't really know what to do with himself. He's not really dancing, but he's still sort of standing there like gesturing with his hands quite a lot.
Yeah, hope for the future, man. That's a banger.
Oh my God. I mean, it's definitely I wish you well, frankly. That's like definitely not what I agree with.
But yeah, I had like I briefly had a Destiny music obsession, like the the Prophecy Dungeon, which is one of my all time favorite bits of Destiny content. And it's like it's it's hard to be able to recommend bits of Destiny because you had to play any chunk of it, you have to play loads of it. So it's never something I would really pressure any listeners into doing.
But that's the one where it's like you're going through this like pink sky, desert and stuff. And this is really spooky music playing. That's really, really good.
But I hope for the future, I just I cannot endorse that. But that just sums up the kind of like unknowable nature of the Matthew Castle's music taste is definitely like, it's like a low key sort of fascination of mine and has been the whole time I've known you.
So it's just a Paul McCartney song, right? And I quite like it.
No, it's just so bad.
No, it's alright. It's honestly, it's alright. Apart from at the end where he runs out of lyrics and it just ends with him going, ooooh.
I just don't know what else to say.
Well, that's very Paul McCartney sort of songwriting.
It says, hope for the future, hope for the future, hope for the future, ooooh.
Well, it's no Palm Tree Panic G-Mix, Matthew, which is an absolute banger. Or the P-Mix actually is probably the real winner out of those. But yes, I wish you well, you wish me well, all is well.
What's your next game?
Resident Evil Village, which I played in 2021, we both played in 2021. Not a favorite in terms of like, oh, it's a 10 out of 10, I'll play it forevermore. But in terms of when I think on the podcast and I think of us both playing that game at the same time and then talking through it, and that being one of the earlier examples where we sat down to chat through something, and it's just such a rich fun game to talk through because of the variety of the campaign and the way that every quarter of it has a slightly different flavor to it.
You've got the pursuit of the giant lady around the castle, then you have the all-timer spooky house. What the hell's the name of the house again?
She's Lady Demetrius. Oh, sorry, you mean the puppet house. Yeah, well remembered.
Yes. And then the less good... There's loads of fucking wolves coming in where it all becomes like werewolf, Resident Evil 4, Siege, endlessly it seems.
But yeah, I just really like the variety of it. It was just a really fun game to talk about, really mix things up. It has individual bits, like the house Beneviento, where you can dive so deep into it.
And it did something so specific, so well, just for a short little bit. I felt like I needed a Capcom game on this list. Capcom, a hugely important developer, publisher for this podcast, like very much like our bag, like Hitman.
Maybe I just wanted some Resident Evil in the list. I feel like Resident Evil 4, it was great. And we both loved it and talked about it loads.
But for some reason, I come back to Village as maybe the lesser game, but one which I feel like we maybe had more to say about on the podcast.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like it's, Resident Evil 4 remake is unquestionably fantastic, but this is a game that takes more chances. It is an original game. And again, like I think it's almost always worth celebrating over a remake.
And so, yeah, I agree. I have fun memories of playing this. There's a lot of different sort of ephemera in this game that was fun to latch on to.
Big woman aside, like the chubby retailer guy, the shopkeeper discussing his belly button. That was a funny part of that episode, I remember. Like how much air that belly button was getting.
That amuses me to reflect upon. Just a really good evolution of what Resi 7 did as well. Resi 7, a bit of a 7 out of 10 game in my head to reflect upon.
This just pushed it further and it's a pretty healthy strand of new Resi. I hope the next one is just as good as this because it's just cool. It's like you say, Capcom, really important to us.
It was a key value to establish in the podcast that Resi is quietly the best series of games in terms of where it's at now and where it has been. Historically, it's one of the most interesting series to dissect in terms of its ups and downs as well. I loved it too, Matthew.
I reflected it fondly. Good stuff. My next game is Deus Ex, which I played in 2021.
It was for the first time. I remember towards the end of my time on TechRadar, I really got into this. I always thought of all the different key games from this period of PC gaming history.
Deus Ex was the most egregious one that I didn't have. I hadn't ticked off or played properly in any form. I think I'd previously played up until I played maybe the first two or three levels of it.
I just thought I would slap on a few mods and go through it and just see if it still had the stuff in the modern day. It really does. The canvas they're working with is why the game can be as multi-path and allow you to mess with it the way you do, because it's now just too expensive to really make optional content in the same way.
It was the perfect time for it. But if you can get past the shooting, not necessarily being best in class these days, it's got so much to offer and its world is so nicely constructed. It really is this pile up of different bits of pop culture really, like there's X-Files in there, there's Illuminati stuff in there.
It's like a patchwork of things you might know, but still feels very original in itself. Then just some of the permutations I didn't really understand till after they happened, like how you can help save Paul, JC's brother if you stick around when their apartment is being raided. But he tells you to leave, and I did leave straight away and then the game was like, oh, Paul's dead, you left Paul to die basically, and then read that, oh no, if you stay and you help Paul fight, Paul survives.
Just that sort of stuff was still amazing to discover in the modern age. I don't know if you had any thoughts on this Matthew, if you remember me playing through this, but I don't know.
Yeah, absolutely. I remember thinking, oh, I need to replay it because I played this when I was a teenager, when it first came out on the back of that crazy PC Gamer review. And there's definitely big chunks of this game I didn't necessarily appreciate from a design perspective.
A lot of the story went over my head. It's a relatively grown up world and piece of storytelling, some of the stuff it's interested in. I've never really been big into conspiracy theory stuff, which I know is such a huge part of this game's DNA.
But I do think playing it now with a more mature mind would probably result in a different experience. I just need to find the time, but I will go back and play this at some point. Maybe I could do a big Deus Ex episode.
That'd be cool. If they ever make another one or something happens, maybe they get Nightdive to redo this one for modern platforms or something. Yeah, really loved it.
Okay. What's your next one, Matthew?
Cobalt Core, quite a recent one. Played in 2023, towards the tail end of it. I've included this as an example of games that I've played to try and find something interesting to talk about in the Game of the Year Top 10, so you're not just wheeling out the same things.
I think you feel similar in that there's a bit of pressure to deliver in those episodes, or to have something interesting or surprising.
Every year I've fucked it to some degree. I think it was last year I had Dorf Romantic in there, which I liked but didn't really love. This year will be the one year I have 10 games that I've played and I properly like.
Oh, that's good. But I agree that that's because I feel the pressure to perform.
Yeah, but in that pressure occasionally, maybe it's a weird way to play games. I'm not just playing games specifically to try and populate an end of the game list, a tiny bit. There's a bit of that.
But there is a sense of, like around this time of year, something kicks in and I'm like, I'll be good if I could find something a little off the beaten track. And so I try to go off the beaten track, whether that's just randomly playing stuff on Steam or trying to find sites or journalists who are good for surfacing this kind of stuff. And every year, you find a couple of things and then I get to pass on someone else's recommendation as my own recommendation and make my list look a bit more interesting, which is nice.
But Cobot Corps is probably one of my favorites of that kind of category of game in terms of its deck building space rogue-like, I guess, where combat is space combat, two ships got sort of dogfighting, and it's defined by different cards you draw that kind of let you move your ship around and fire certain weapons. I just thought it was a really fun translation of space combat and that idea, you know, into a form which could be played with cards. So, you know, I really liked how, you know, that you could sort of build up different elements of your ship, you know, whether it was like having something just incredibly nimble, which no one could ever land a shot on, or kind of like powering everything into just some kind of like mega weapon, or the way that you manipulate the space between you and another ship, you know, kind of has, you know, it's a relatively simple setup, but there's lots of different approaches to it, which, you know, is always kind of crucial to these rogue-like games.
You know, you want the idea of, like, there are lots of different paths to victory that exist in this system, and this one definitely ticks that. Also, just, I think the, you know, the storytelling in the world of it was really nicely done. Absolutely incredible soundtrack.
My second most listened-to thing on YouTube, after Hope for the Future by Paul McCartney. So, yeah, I listen to this co-op course soundtrack all the time. A good soundtrack really can, like, change my mind on a game.
Like, there's loads of games that I think I like, 10s, just because I really like the soundtracks, and will happily listen to them over and over again.
Almost like Norco on my list for this reason, actually. Just like, it's a music that captures a real feeling of how I played it, how it felt to play at the time.
Yes, yeah. Yeah, Norco is absolutely like another of one of these kind of games, you know, where it kind of came along, played it, really loved it. Signalist, to an extent as well, was like that.
Yeah, just, it's nice having a reason to try and sort of aggressively find something a bit odder for that game of the year choice, for that list. Yeah, some of my favorites every year come about through that process. So it may be a bit of a weird way of doing things, but it works for me.
No, I agree. It's sort of, it's just, it's good to just force yourself to like look a bit further afield than the five or six blockbusters that came out that year and force yourself to just find something that you might love and in doing so, like stumble into something that you do actually love. And I think Cobalt Core was that for both of us, for sure.
Yeah, I really, really loved it. Always meant to like play definitively and finish every single like loop with the different types of ships and to find all the different characters. But I didn't quite have the time to do that.
But the 30 hours I played of it or 25 hours, something like that, you know, I felt very nourished by, I thought they made something great. Maybe at some point I will go back to that. Maybe it'll be like FTL where I do just swing by every few years, give it a go, play a few loops.
Good pick, Matthew. Okay. My next pick is Metroid Dread, which I played in early 2022.
This missed my best games of 2021 list. Should have been in it really. And I just didn't quite have time for it before the end of that year.
I picked this because it's an example of a game where a series and genre that I knew and had engaged with before, but never really loved, finally clicked into place why this thing is great and why this thing is my sort of thing. I think it's really interesting to play Metroid Dread, then go back and play other Metroid games and then realize that this game does push that 2D Metroid formula forward a little bit, certainly in terms of movement and difficulty. I think there's to make a few choices that can be a little bit controversial.
The ME attacks, for example, those sections very contentious, having to very precisely time a counter in order to not be killed by these very difficult enemies. But just thought this was one of the best Switch games ever because it just had that level of production values you really wanted. It could be spooky, it could be exciting, but all the different areas of the world felt just so lush.
Then just silent Samus going through this spooky sci-fi world and then getting all those abilities and then trying to unlock all of the extra stats boosters, basically just by pulling off ridiculous, is it Spark Shine kind of moves, Matthew?
Where you run and then fire yourself up and all that jazz.
Proposterous combinations of things that look impossible, but then you do eventually learn how to do them. Just had that level of mastery you want as well. Yeah, just felt significant in the lifespan of the podcast, Matthew.
I know you love this too.
Yeah, and it was a really pleasant surprise because I think it came about quite quickly. They announced it and then it was out a few months later. A game which looks so good in the hands compared to how it looks in trailers.
It just looked a bit basic, I thought, when they first showed it off. You were like, I don't know about this. But yeah, also I find it quite hard to untie from, because it came out along the OLED Switch and was a really great showcase for that as well.
I don't know if I've actually ever played this on TV.
Yeah, me neither, and I never will. I feel that way about most Switch games really. I think I judge the aesthetics by how they look on a handheld, which I think is really the right spirit of the Switch.
So yeah. Okay, good stuff. What's your next pick, Matthew?
A Castle classic, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, which I played in 2022 when it came out. Xenoblade has been just a really important game to me, like, throughout my Nintendo magazine career. It kind of came out of nowhere, got me into a genre which I hadn't played masses of, you know, not like Mr. JRPG at all.
You know, I've played a lot more since then, but I feel like I have the relationship with Xenoblade that other people seem to have with the kind of formative JRPGs of their youth, like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest or Vagrant Story or whatever the fuck people were into. So this was, yeah, I just, you know, I really love this character, I really love, you know, this series, you know, its mix of open world exploration and slightly kind of MMO-y combat, I guess, is how you'd describe it. Also this huge, mad anime story, kind of embedded at the heart of it.
Really, really overblown, but kind of an opportunity for a big thinker and a really ambitious developer to sort of really finally kind of deliver on their sort of vision and have the budget and time to actually land one of these games. And I was always just amazed at how, you know, I really love all the Xenoblade 1, 2 and 3 sort of equally. Like, as a ranking exercise, it's difficult because, you know, they're all, they all have like quite distinct sort of spoke mechanics and characters and settings and stories.
But yeah, that this one just happened to land in our kind of podcast time and, and, you know, deliver as much as, you know, the previous two. It's kind of here of relief more than anything that it didn't sort of shit the bed because that would have been heartbreaking. But yeah, just a kind of a huge continuation.
And it was really fun having the opportunity to do an episode to kind of like talk about the Xenoblade experience, the Xenoblade thing, and try and kind of introduce people to it if they hadn't played it. And, you know, it's always nice to see people pick this game up, you know, on Discord or Twitter or whatever and say that they're playing it because they listen to it on the podcast. I mean, you know, it's a huge game.
This is kind of a different situation to, to, you know, 428 or ParanormalSite or whatever. Like, I'm not going to claim kind of any success for getting Xenoblade Outlet because it's huge anyway.
But you are one of its, like, few sort of like exponents in the media. There's not that many people in the media who are like, this is the thing.
I guess, like, it pretty plays on my mind, like, you know, between games more than it does for most, I guess, you know, and we try and talk about it at every opportunity. So, yeah, maybe that's that's fair. But, you know, a fun thing to be part of, and, you know, I hope it kind of continues.
I'm really interested to see, like, what Monolith Software does next, because it felt like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and its DLC felt like kind of an ending of sorts for the whole thing. So whether they'll just make a new series now, I don't know. Be curious to see what happens.
Yeah, absolutely. I imagine we'll find out in the next year or two, you know, given their usual work rate. Yeah.
Okay. Good stuff, Matthew. I did always mean to play these.
It's just, just need another lifetime, really, in order to get through the work.
Yeah, yeah. It's only as a proper, like, you know, you've got 300 hours kind of job, which is tough.
I always intended to get through Definitive Edition when that launched in the pandemic. That was like, I had nothing better to do then. I should have played it instead of doing Destiny Dungeons over and over again.
That's on me. But yeah, such was my headspace at the time. But yeah, it's been cool hearing you talk about a genre that you're not necessarily, you never really think of yourself as an authority in Japanese RPGs.
But there are some things that you just understand incredibly well and articulate very well. I think discussing these games and their appeal is definitely one of those things, Matthew.
Thanks.
Okay. My penultimate game that I'm going to discuss then is My House.WOD, the Doom mod that came out last year, made by a mysterious creator as a fake tribute to a deceased friend, the house that he used to live in, and actually turns out to be a multi-layered horror masterpiece. Pick this because this was an example of something that everyone said, you got to play this, don't read much about it, just go in and see what it's about, and then being rewarded for that curiosity with just so many amazing ideas.
So essentially, the first phase of it basically is that you are in this house. This is roughly like riffing on the book House of Leaves, which I did pick up and honestly just thought was very pretentious, and probably should have read it when I was 18, if I was ever going to read it. I feel a little bit too old now for it, it's this high concept, what the fuck is wrong with this house story?
But this uses that as a starting point basically, because this house, the layout of it keeps changing over the course of time, and it's like you exit and then you look around the sides, and you see a load of monsters inside, and you realize the layout of the house has changed, and there's a corridor here that goes nowhere, and then the house changes again. It keeps messing with your head in all these amazing ways, and then it becomes even more abstract. I guess enough time has probably passed here, but I will say, putting some spoiler barriers up here for about a minute while I talk about some of the stuff in here.
Matthew knows a lot of this already. Like going into a, seeing like a, you're in like a kid's, basically like a nursery or like a preschool of sorts, and then there's like a big image of Shrek on the wall, like you might see a kind of like colorful character there, and then you mess with something, and the image disappears, you go out into the garden, and then this figure emerges from the shadows, and you are fighting Shrek in this kid's play park, but it's like quite frightening because it's like Doom, pixel art, Shrek, and that's just one of like many crazy things that just happens in this game, and like there's like a whole perspective shifting area, where it's like Alice in Wonderland style, things will shrink or grow depending on like how you've entered this space. In the regular size version, there's this little dog that follows you around.
In the shrunken version, the dog is a giant Cerberus that attacks you, and you can kill it. It's really fucking hard to kill it, but you can. But if you don't kill it, when you get to the very end of my house, and you're on this beach basically like to celebrate your victory, the little dog is still there in a life, but if you kill the Cerberus, the dog is not there.
That's tough.
Tough break for the dog.
All these fucking permutations in different roots and past to nowhere, that's only really describing about probably 25% of the content in this.
I just like that you say horror masterpiece, and then seconds later you're talking about fighting Shrek.
But that's the thing. It was just such a great little mystery box to unravel, and I just think of it as a really meaningful experience. I know you've heard me bang on about this loads, Matthew.
No, it's great. I mean, it's part of this trend of fourth-wall breaking meta, bizarro games, I guess a bit like the- Description.
Yes, yeah, and Pony Island and that stuff. That's really fun to see people kind of fuck with the form that way.
Yeah, and you can just play it for free if you have any copy of Doom on Steam, basically, you can just easily install it. It's incredibly generous. If the creator ever did break cover, I'd be like, man, it's 10 quid for all the joys this gave me.
You deserve it, but no, made it to be appreciated by the world and for no other purpose.
What if I was to tell you it was me?
I would be like, I'd be like, wow, I mean, that explains why I've been doing all the podcast plans anyway. It's like he hasn't been writing scripts, trying to be funny about Assassin's Creed this whole time. He's been programming Doom mods.
That would be like an amazing twist, to be honest. Did you create myhouse.word, Matthew?
Yeah, if you go into the attic, you'll see Paul McCartney singing.
And on that note, we move on to your final game.
The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom played in 2023. I don't know if it's a contentious one. It's definitely a game you and I are not in agreement on.
Probably one of the more aggressive golfs in our opinion.
Yeah, but really interesting as a result.
In that I think it's like just another masterpiece and you don't. Yeah, I'm so much kind of curious about this game. The idea of a direct sequel in the same landmass.
What could they possibly do to kind of spice that up? You know, Beyonce, Ada, Sky in the underground realm. I'd say that's those are those are grand changes, but also slightly superficial in that, you know, it's it's, you know, it's kind of decoration on this this land, which is already familiar.
I think the stuff actually resonated with me more was, you know, seeing how, you know, some of the characters or communities had kind of moved on the more kind of subtle storytelling beats, you know, going back to Goron Mountain, seeing that they were, you know, basically in the grip of an opioid crisis, which was which was crazy. And, you know, those those kind of changes, I thought there was a lot of magic in it, you know, from a nuts and bolts, Zelda perspective, I thought that they found a little bit more of the kind of missing dungeon magic from from the previous game, you know, to Breath of the Kingdom, you know, one of the Breath of the Wild, one of the kind of criticisms aimed at it is that for all it does right, it doesn't have a lot of like the really kind of trad sort of Zelda dungeons. And this, they're still not quite there, but the kind of roots to them and the definitely the bosses at the end of them, I thought they ticked a lot more of my boxes, Zelda boxes, and crucially I really, really liked the building and crafting system in this, which is not something I'm normally into.
And I know people go, you just like it because Nintendo made it, and that's fair enough. If people want to see it that way, they can see it that way. But I thought the kind of playfulness and experimentation of building contraptions and vehicles, the relative ease, definitely messy by Nintendo standards.
The Hold Your Hand is not the absolute kind of like 10 out of 10 implementation you might be hoping for. But compared to, you know, other contraption building games, this was welcoming enough that I really got into that and really kind of connected with that element of kind of playfulness, the mad kind of physics sandbox of it all. I found that the game in this very familiar world was kind of completely unfamiliar to me and what I was doing and how I tackled it, you know, was really eye opening to me.
So, yeah, a really, really special game to me. Do find Breath of the Wild a little sparse compared to this now. And, you know, I think enough time has passed that I can sort of more comfortably say that I think this is the one for me.
But I, you know, also always with a tinge of sadness that I know it's not just you, but like there's lots of people out there who don't quite sort of see it that way, which is fair enough.
Yes, it's really interesting how I will observe as someone who has made this podcast with you, how your love of Nintendo is like 90% a blessing for the podcast and 10% a curse. It just means that every now and then you'll say something like, you know, you'll be into the system like the Ultrahand stuff here. And then, yeah, you do have to endure a little bit of like criticism of, well, you only like it because Nintendo does it.
And it's sort of like, I know that you are able to be objective about games. And I probably did say that to you when we recorded it. But I think it's quite interesting to hear your thoughts now in that the sense of like, there's a slightly messy side to this game.
It's not quite as polished or neat as it maybe could be. But it still succeeds in spite of that.
I just think if you meet it halfway, the place it takes you is such an interesting place that it's worth doing. And that isn't true. There's lots of games that ask you to meet them halfway for fucking nothing.
And this isn't that.
Yeah, that's fair enough. I think as well I'm looking forward to the Michael Keaton series, Dope Sick 2, colon the Goron opioid crisis. I'm like, that's gonna be a real banger on Disney Plus 2025.
Should be good. Yeah, I did go back and play this after we did the episode. I played about 30 hours of it.
I just haven't fallen in love with it. But I don't know, a lot of the best things in life are acquired tastes. And that's probably just a symptom of the game taking chances, which it definitely does.
And that is far more interesting than if they just done Breath of the Wild again. I think the one thing that I would say about Breath of the Wild is, once you've done it all, there's not really a reason to play it again. It's not that kind of game.
It's like you discover everything and then you're done. And I think that's it. Even though it's got systems that suggest you could play it forever, I don't think that's how I feel about it.
I think the discovery is the magic of it. And once you've used it up, there's not a reason to go back. I would probably never replay Breath of the Wild.
I'm happy to reflect on it as a great 75-hour memory. The fact that Tears of Kingdom does try so radically to do something else is to its credit. No, it wasn't for me, but that's okay.
And I'm glad you liked it as much as you did. And I think it's interesting to end on your last Game of the Year for your final pick here, Matthew. So good stuff.
All right. My final pick then is Star Wars Jedi Survivor, which was my Game of the Year pick from last year. I chose this not because I've historically talked about Star Wars a lot on this podcast, which I have.
I think we've done three, four episodes now that are about Star Wars. Don't worry, I won't do another one for a while now. But I picked this because it's still my platonic ideal of the great modern blockbuster.
It's like a campaign that respects your time, but there's loads of other cool stuff to go and do if you want to keep playing. I think there's just a judiciousness to the way it was made, that I think is actually quietly in plain sight, the way it should be done. It shouldn't be, you have to do reams and reams of stuff in order to progress.
It should be like, if you just follow the critical path, you will be absolutely rewarded for it. And along the way, all of the set piece design is so, so good. Again, much like Guardians of Galaxy, I guess, it probably gets closer to that big scripted Naughty Dog moments feeling than any other game does this generation, way more so than Jedi Fallen Order does.
Jedi Fallen Order doesn't have these moments quite as much, but the way they use platforming or a big boss will be implemented, or just a really exciting one-off set piece. This game has probably four to five really good versions of those. Really, maybe quietly the most improved sequel as well of any recent series.
I was very fond of Jedi Fallen Order, but think it was flawed as a combat game, and definitely felt like a first effort at doing something. This is the real deal. So yeah, as well as being a great Star Wars experience, weirdly I think it's better at all the other things than it does in terms of combat and world design and set pieces than it is at being a Star Wars story.
I think it's only moderately interesting as a Star Wars story. What do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, I mean, I did enjoy the story, and I think it's got some good characters in it, and made me buy into that cast of characters. A lot of that stuff washed over me with the original. I don't know if there is a fondness for them, but I thought they kind of landed more successfully.
Yeah, I just really like the 3D Metroidvania thing. I thought the way that that central planet opens up as you have repeat visits, not just opens up, but even though you unlock the powers, there's still quite a nice challenge in actually using them. A lot of Metroidvanias, they're a little bit like, oh, you go back to this place and this power will get you through that hole and you can just pick something up, and it's quite kind of boring, locking key stuff.
We're actually here, you end up platforming to places you're like, oh, I didn't really know there was a level here. That's kind of cool. It really kind of blossoms in that way, which I think the best Metroid, Metroid-y games do.
So yeah, I really like this. I thought it kind of delivered on the good ass action adventure game, but also quite a compelling Star Wars game. I liked how much different Star Wars there was in it, because it has some sort of throwbacks to the prequels in some quite fun ways, but also has all the classic trilogy stuff that you want as well.
It's quite a rare transmedia Star Wars project that actually makes the best of different worlds and different eras. Yeah, it's just a really good game.
Yeah, both these games as well just have the spoiler alert, so here's your pull over and fucking whack pause notice, the big Darth Vader moments. Weirdly I think the Darth Vader moment in this is slightly too frustrating to be...
To fight his heart. I mean, he is meant to be Darth Vader.
That is true. That is true. But it does...
They do hit the spots of like as like dramatic beats. It was like establishing him as the ultimate threat. And I assume there will be a, you know, they're making a third game in this trilogy.
I assume there will be a final Cal Darth Vader encounter at some point to look forward to in that game. But yeah, well, this team is great. Assembled an amazing team to make this stuff.
Their expertise is, I know, it's really valuable. But no one else is doing it to this level, in my opinion, at the moment. So yeah, fingers crossed.
Okay, Matthew, we are done. That was episode 200. It was lengthy.
It was ambitious. But I hope people enjoyed it. And we will keep doing them.
But yeah, it was really fun. Thank you for going along with my script to mull my silly bullshit, Matthew. That was your game as ever for any nonsense I throw your way.
It's been a pleasure. And I'm excited to keep doing this. Hopefully we'll just keep doing this long into the future.
It feels like really good rhythm, doesn't it?
So yeah, for sure.
Yeah. All right. Well, that's us.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzill underscore Pesto on Twitter and at MrBazzillPesto no underscore on Blue Sky, where I've seen a surge of followers recently, which is nice because there's no content there.
Yep. As Twitter is further fucked into the bin, Blue Sky becomes more of a concern. Indeed, the podcast has passed 400 followers on there.
So we are posting on there. You can now post videos on there as well. So when we post audio clips of the episode, then they'll go on there as well as Twitter.
So if you didn't want to leave Twitter, you'll get all the same engagement from the podcast on there. But yes, I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both those platforms.
The podcast is at BackpagePod on both as well. There is also the Discord you can join. There's a link to that in the profile on Twitter and Blue Sky too.
So that's available, backpagegames.gmail.com, and of course, patreon.com/backpagepod. If you like the podcast, you would like to support it financially. We're very grateful to everyone who does.
Matthew, let's get out of here, goodbye.
