Ho, ho, ho, welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello, ho, ho, ho.
Also known as Games Journalism Santa Claus, Matthew Castle. That's not actually true at all. But will any editors be receiving a gift in their stockings from you this year, Matthew?
I.e. a great pitch for a feature next year, or?
No.
You're out of that game, you're done.
I'm very lazy. I don't think so. I think you're the father Christmas of this podcast.
You think so? Yeah, I mean, certainly I'm gaining the weight against. That's good.
Not in terms of that, just in terms of as you kind of lead it, I'm more of like Dudley Moore, that elf in Santa Claus, the movie.
Okay. Well, that's a great cut. Fair play.
I don't know if I consider myself a Santa Claus, I'm sort of like a cursed Santa figure, more of like the kind of Krampus figure where I might argue with the listeners every now and then. Actually, it's been pretty civil with the draft. The draft that went up last week, the sub-80 Metacritic draft, is currently about 60% me, 40% you, and it's interesting to see some of the discourse there.
I don't feel like it's been as fiery and competitive necessarily, but it's quite interesting to see people weigh in what they consider viable, what they don't, Matthew. What have you made of that so far?
I think I had too many heart picks, to be honest. I had plenty of opportunities to take some of the things that you eventually took, but I didn't because I thought they wouldn't mean much to people, but as always with the drafts, just pick what people have played. That's always the key.
People just not interested. They're not using this as a buyer's guide for something new. They're just using it to reinforce that they've already got good taste.
So what can you do? I'm not bitter. What can you do?
You're a bad Santa. That's the Santa I am. I'm Billy Bob Thornton.
I think you had a mix of heart picks and things that you thought people would like in there. And I think that was not necessarily a bad shout, but like, yeah, I think the, I think maybe the likes of Prey and Mirror's Edge were more battleground games than maybe you anticipated a tiny bit just based on those two ideas come up, you know, over and over again.
I picked some games which are famous for being overlooked.
Right.
And they were overlooked. So that is on me. The Wonderful 101.
Again, not being appreciated. This is just history repeating. Centennial Case.
Oh, that's fucking madness in hindsight.
Centennial Case versus Hotel Dusk is tough, but I think you kind of trusted that the listeners would believe in your pick there. And you know, there are some passionate Matthew Castle supporters who have come out for you. You know, like when John Major's leadership was challenged in the late 90s.
Someone, I don't remember who, had a good go at taking them down and they didn't win, but you know, it was enjoyable nonetheless.
It's the people who vote for you or vote for one person and then try to sort of throw the other person a bone on Discord, like that means anything. Where they're like, oh, but I'm sure this is also good. And it's like, I don't know if I can give me that.
You know, it's, we should have the new condition that the other 10 games you didn't vote for are deleted from you forever and you will never be able to try them.
That's a nice idea.
You're all in on nothing.
That's a nice idea, actually. Maybe we should impose that more in the next, in the PS2 draft, like vote for the 10 you want to keep because the rest will be lost to history forever.
So it's not like, oh, I'll try that. Give that a go, you know, some other time. It's like, no, you had your chance.
If you were genuinely interested in trying the fucking Centennial case, which no one said they were. You know, they...
A sentence never uttered to date.
It's over, man. You had your chance with the case. And the mystery of what happened to the Shijima family will never be known to you.
Amazing. But you know what hasn't been deleted from history is all those other games that Matthew likes. Paranormal Sight is still out there.
That's still there to be enjoyed. So that's good. The Seven Mysteries of Honjo.
Yeah. It's funny to hear you say that. I mean, you're in the position I was after like about a year of draft losses to you.
I lost something like six or seven drafts in a row to you. And I think at a certain point I got paranoid the listeners were just doing it because they liked you more than me. And then now I've learned two things.
One, you cannot present yourself as the villain during the draft or they will vote against you even if you pick the best games. That's like, that's definitely true. And secondly as well, I think you just got to be locked into the head space of like, I'm just going to be completely neutral throughout this draft anyway, just so people don't think it's getting to me when I lose a certain game like Anthem or whatever.
And I was pretty neutral during that draft. And I think that helped. I'm glad because the foot is off the gas a little bit for the PS2 draft in January.
So I can go into that a little bit sort of like fresh and not too worried as Ash picks lots of like strange mech games from Japan I've never heard of. I saw him posted something on Blue Sky the other day. It was like some kind of super dandy robot game or something like that.
And I was like, he's going to pick that and David Scarborough is going to pick fucking Medal of Honor Frontline and it's going to be... I'm so excited about that contrast. I think it's going to be a good podcast in our future.
I have something else to note for you, Matthew. I went to Slim Chickens in Bath today. Are you aware of Slim Chickens?
You've talked about it, but where is it?
It's where GBK used to be. GBK is one of the latest...
Oh yeah, to the bottom of town. Sure, sure, sure.
Yeah, right near... in that sort of Southgate area where I feel like I've never had a good meal in Southgate. Franco Manca is alright, but a lot of mediocre chain restaurants in that Southgate area.
But this has opened up. It's a chicken chain, like one of these premium chicken chains that's popped up. And I've got to say, it was quite a cursed experience.
Went in there, there's like three self-service booths that you order at. Two of them were not working, so that was good. There was a lot of families, I would say a lot of families sat around waiting for food, and it was taking ages.
And I saw like at least like two sets of people go up to the counter and say, where's my chicken? That was unfortunate. The person I was with, she sat down on this row of chairs, and it created this kind of seesaw effect where like the other end of the chair sort of like went up because it didn't appear to be nailed down into the actual like where it's supposed to be.
The Chuckle Brothers built this place.
And I would say the decor, it's very close to what I would describe as a restaurant that would be built into a bowling alley. That was kind of the vibe of it. I would say slightly unconvincing.
And the chicken was just all right. The person I was with said to me, I think that M&S do better tenders than this. Have like a box.
Ouch. Yeah. The one thing they got on their side though is they have a large variety of sauces.
Went for blue cheese and buffalo, of course, but and honey mustard, actually. Those are all great. And I felt like they were banking on the sauces to disguise the absolute lack of flavouring or spicing in the coating of their chicken.
So it's a five out of 10 from MeDog.
Thank you for that update. And to any listeners coming to Bath, Slim Chickens is one of the first things you will see leaving the train station. So just don't be tempted.
Yeah, indeed.
Culinary delights await you if you only cross the road.
Indeed. Or if you take the, go across the bridge to the left and go to Magu Burger instead at the Nowhere Pub. That's like the best burger place in Bath.
Actually, where are you at with burgers these days? Do you agree with that? Take Bath or do you still think that there's a better burger out there?
I find there's something a bit full on about Magu Burgers. I feel like we're not quite on the same page with that. It's a similar complaint that I have about your beloved Taylor's Bagels.
Oh, yeah. You're on the wrong side of history there.
I just think there's just a little bit too much.
It depends on the one you get. Taylor's has a cream cheese smoked salmon one that I think is absolute bonanza, but it also has a sort of pulled meat one that has a load of melted cheese on it. That is a bit much, I would say.
And I would say that you want to go for one of those bagels. It sounds like it won't be. I mean, for example, there's literally like a Christmas dinner on a bagel at the moment.
And I can't recommend that. I mean, I'm sure it's like very tasty for a person who's after a Christmas dinner in the form of a sandwich. That person is not Samuel Roberts.
But the bacon, cream cheese and chili jam bagel is absolutely wonderful. It's a breakfast bagel. That's great.
And the smoked salmon cream cheese one gets my highest approval rating. Yes, I'm fond of Taylor's Bagels, Matthew. But where would you even go for a good burger and bath now?
I feel like since Milk Bun disappeared, they've only got that little sandwich shop open now. You used to have them and Magu right near each other, like an absolute, like a perfect dyad of beautiful burgers, but quite different burgers, and now one's gone. So where are you going for your burgers these days?
I'm just not having burgers. I mean, Schwartz Brothers.
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, that's classic. Yeah, of course.
Yeah. Okay. That says it all, really.
Sort of like Matthew Castle's, I don't want to say pedestrian, but like more civilian level burger experience. Kind of what you're after, isn't it?
Fuck off. Civilian level.
Well, he gave me with Schwartz Brothers and no further explanation. So I thought, well, okay, I'll keep talking then. In the absence of words from Matthew Castle, I guess I'll just say more words.
So that was good. Okay. This episode then, the Alternative GOTY Awards, or The Back Page Holiday Special, I can't remember how exactly I advertised it.
This seemed to go down quite well last year. So here it is again with a little bit like I was underselling it there. But you've got a mix of game specific awards in here, kind of like Jokey Awards, I guess.
A lot of websites have seen doing similar kinds of things at the moment, maybe more of a British games journalism thing to do some Jokey Awards. And in the midst of that, we'll have some of our favorite guests from this year who are popping up. Well, we asked all of the guests from this year if they'd like to participate.
There are no favorites here. We haven't cut anyone out. So it's all whether they responded or not.
Matthew's been handling that admin side of things, which I'm relieved about. So we'll have those in amongst the awards. Anything to add Matthew before we get into these?
We don't know at this point what a lot of those things are going to be. So we can't react to them specifically. So it will be the usual mix of us going, who's this?
We don't know. And then Great Pick, which we didn't hear. So, yeah, you just got to roll with it.
This is quite a hazy episode last year, because I went to Japan straight after recording it and listened to it. And it was actually like did have a bit of the Star Wars Holiday Special vibe where there were whole bits that didn't really go anywhere and strange little pacing bits like when Ellie Gibson was in a car recording her bit. It really did have the energy of some Ewok children watching some little chess guys have a fight or a little dance, whatever it is, the fuck is going on in that thing.
It's been interesting actually. Some people are just like, yeah, that's fine. You know, when you ask and then some people need like a bit more information, like they think I'm going to stitch them up or something.
You know, like there was a hint of suspicion to some of the replies.
Oh, interesting. Okay. Yeah.
Well, I did describe it as you're like guests at Noel's house party. So it's like ding dong. And then you come through and do like a little bit for a minute and then leave.
Yeah. I mean that reference alone, I can only think of at least two guests from this year who would just probably plain not understand that reference at all. But you know, that's interesting to hear, Matthew.
Maybe they're just freaked out by you doing like pod admin. Maybe that just was like, oh, Matthew is emailing me. That's I'm not used to this.
That's me taking a joking dig at you.
Feels like I've gone rogue and I'm setting up a second podcast or something. They're like, is this legit? This doesn't feel legit.
This is really back page related. It would be something about this guy. What's happening?
Yeah. Welcome to the Inside Back Cover Podcast. This is Matthew Castle and Jeremy Peel.
I don't know who you'd do that podcast with, but...
Who would you be most wounded if I set up a podcast with?
I don't know.
Who would?
I'm not sure.
No, I don't know. I think I just wish you well. I don't know in a genuine sense.
I'm not sure.
I'm not going to do it. I'm just far too lazy.
Yeah, that's it. That's the thing. I can't take the threat seriously because there is no threat level.
That's the problem. It's just not plausible enough for a thing to happen. Anyway, enough digs, Matthew.
Let's get into these awards then. So you have curated them this year. Some of them were carried over from last year.
Anything you want to say about them before we kick off?
I'm worried that I've gone in too sincere with a lot of them. I just thought about them rather than try to do them as punchlines. So I guess we'll wait and see what happens.
Yeah, that's it. I mean, it may be funny. It may not.
Either way, a podcast will happen before your very eyes slash ears. So first up, then, is Best Hang, Matthew. Who have you got for Best Hang?
Annoyingly, I haven't played this game. I picked the little bat guy from Metaphor Re-Fantazio, Heismay.
Oh, right.
Heismay, I think he's pronounced. I've been playing with the Japanese dub, so I never actually hear their names spoken that clearly. Ala Persona.
He's like, a bit unfair to say he's this game's Teddy or Mona standing. He's like the animal one. He's a tiny little bat.
He's got a very deep voice. I listened to the English dub a tiny bit, and his voice sounds like Alan Rickman. So he's kind of like a very sly bat assassin.
I feel like a fan favourite, because he's got a bit of edge to him. He's a little bit sinister, and that's what people like. He's not a thirst trap, because he's again a two-foot bat.
That's a great... The animal companions in RPGs, or animal sidekicks in RPGs, would be a fun list to do. I feel like a Hall of Famer would be that little Welsh lad in Nino Cooney.
He's sort of like...
Oh, Drippy.
Mr. Drippy is up there, right? He comes up loads when we're talking about this kind of thing. I feel like 40% of all Nino Cooney discourse is about Mr. Drippy being Welsh.
I'm certain of that, but okay.
That's because most people's only interaction with it is the trailer, where you hear his voice quite clearly. So it's quite easy to go. If you had to fake that you've played Nino Cooney based on the trailer, you'd just lean into the Welsh stuff for five minutes.
Yeah, that's true. I just picked Yuffie for this, Matthew. I was trying to think of the FF7 Rebirth cast member I like the most, and I think it is probably her.
I think she's the most consistently fun. Her and Barra are quite fun together, actually. That's a pairing they lean on for some quite good dialogue throughout the game.
So I like her going around and occasionally threatening martial arts people. That was quite good. Yeah, she was alright.
Also, runner up here, the two lads who follow you around in Space Marine 2. They seem like pretty good dudes. Quite enjoyed spending like 7 or 8 hours with them.
They're also in there. I have many more selections for Worst Hang, though, as you might expect. So who have you got for Worst Hang, Matthew?
My Worst Hang, and this may be recency bias, is Harding, Scout Harding from Dragon Age The Veilguard, who was like a sort of dwarf helper in Inquisition, who's been elevated to full-on companion. Just very twee. Her kind of dilemma or the kind of problem she's dealing with in the game is that she absorbs a magic blast, which gives her like rock magic powers, and dwarves aren't traditionally a magic people, so she's kind of wrestling with this.
Every time she's around, the game sags a little bit for me, and the second I could get her out of the party, the second there were more than two companions basically, she was gone. It's like a real, be careful what you wish for, like people had a fondness I guess for this character in Inquisition, I didn't, and so they went, oh yeah, that's really double down on her, she's just like nothing, you know?
Yeah, yeah, still yet to get to this, but seems like people being turned off by some of the more twee or like more conflict-averse content in Dragon Age Veil Guard, it's been one of the persistent criticisms of it.
She's just kind, that's her character, and that's just not an interesting thing to see in a game.
Yeah, I think kindness in general is, I think there's maybe a bit of a slight overdose of this in media in recent years as a response to how hostile going on, like the internet feels or how grim the future feels, like I think that's happened, but that's not interesting, unfortunately. Conflict is genuinely interesting, and that always has been in storytelling, and kindness has never been interesting in storytelling, really. I think it's okay to have a bit of conflict in there.
You need some bad boys.
Yeah, I think so. Dragon Age has always had that, so it sounds like some of the other companions do tick that box, though, Matthew. So, maybe Harding is just the exception.
Any others, Matthew, or is that your main one?
That's my main one. I want to hear your long list.
Yeah, I've got a few here. So, I'd say any of the NPCs in Silent Hill 2 remake, but especially Eddie, that guy is like, anytime he turns up, you're like, oh, just the vibes of Eddie are just so grim. Just this very unhinged overweight man who is overeating himself, and his aura is not good.
I mean, the aura is bad for all of the NPCs in this game, but Eddie is the hall of famer there. I wouldn't count Pyramid Head here. He's not really a hang.
He just sort of turns up. Randy Newman in Dragon's Dogma 2. You know, he went on an epic adventure with me.
I did grow to love him eventually, but I would say 40 hours of that journey was, I was me thinking, this guy's a tough hang as he was going, we should go over here. When I was here with my master, I went over there. All that kind of stuff.
I spent, I reckon I spent more time with Randy Newman this year than real friends in my actual life, which is tough. So, him, Matthew.
But I made him, I made him as good as he could be to make that time special.
Yeah.
I love that because I was doing a lot of video capture for PlayStation Access this year. There's loads of PlayStation Access videos randomly with Randy Newman in them. And it just says Randy Newman on the screen and it just must be so, if anyone has any idea who that is, it must be very, very baffling.
Why he is in like the official PlayStation UK YouTube channel.
Yeah, the best part of it was when Jeremy Peel thought you'd basically designed him in the game. He really does.
He looks more like Jeremy Peel than he does Randy Newman.
Yeah, he does. Yeah, he's like short Jeremy Peel. Okay, that's it.
That's that myself and Helldivers 2. Actually, I'll tell you something that's happened this year. My pals who I play at Frontier, who I play games with, told me I was a tough hang the two times they played Helldivers with me, and didn't invite me back when they started playing CFVs on PS5.
That's tough.
Oh, that is brutal. CFVs is quite hard to be as troublesome as you can be in Helldivers, I would think.
Yeah, I think they just caught me on a bad day, but I did like the idea of nominating myself for worst hang. Also nominating my friend Will in Helldivers 2 for all the times he called in mines for no reason other than to blow us up for no reason. And finally, Chadly in FF7 Rebirth.
Stop trying to make Chadly happen, Scrooge-X. He is a net loss for the FF7 experience. Any thoughts on Chadly, Matthew?
Chadly is rough. He just doesn't really fit in anywhere. And like there's hints that there's like some deeper story with him, but I'm just not interested.
I hope they don't elevate him to like some weird extra party member or something.
He's got, he's like, this could be an email, but in character form, I would say. He could just be a menu screen. You just go into like a go to a computer terminal and then dial up the simulator or create to make Mako.
It could have just he could have been built in to every save point that you find around the world, I think. So Chadly is a net loss. Glad the voice actor who plays him is making some bank, I guess.
But everyone else is losing out in my view. Catch Heath as well would be here as well. Just it's a bit much really, isn't it?
And also also Red 13 in the second half of this game as well, Matthew. I think that's yeah.
That's why that doesn't have a toggle option in the menu to like revert. I don't know.
Very upsetting. There's a litany of catastrophes in the second half of that game that I'll talk about in the next week's podcast. But anyway, otherwise I'm enjoying it.
Next one then Matthew. The Critics GOT THIS ROG Award. What have you got for this one?
There haven't been any major, like major, major howlers that I could think of.
Agree.
I think Star Wars Outlaws got a bit of a dud deal. I think it's a little bit better than people said it was in reviews. I think a lot of people rushed through the single player campaign because actually I think when you slow it down and take your time, there's a bit more going on in that game with its faction systems.
And it didn't just feel like the same Ubisoft Open World to me, which I always find a very lazy criticism of quite kind of down on people who just say, oh, it's just that. And you're like, well, there are some keys to this. Likewise, Rise of the Ronin, which I quite liked on PS5, you know, which is sort of what if Assassin's Creed had like genuinely lethal team ninja combat.
It is quite a lot of exploring an open world and clearing out outposts and all that kind of stuff. But at the heart of it is, you know, very, very sharp, violent combat, which I really liked. Also just has a wonkiness to it.
It's not got a romance system per se, but like there's a friendship system and you can basically sort of hang out with all these historical figures and give them presents to make them like you. And the idea on kind of sort of going on a date with Commodore Perry made me laugh. Like it's just some odd stuff in this game.
And like there's characters that if you choose to spare them, they then join this friendship pool. And the idea that they were like one decapitation away from just not being in the game anymore. But then here they are and you're giving them a box of chocolates and to make their heart meet to go up.
Damn, it's like Deus Ex.
Yeah, I thought that was… It deserved a second look. Not a game I think people got wrong in that.
I know they like it, but where I probably differed most from critics was Thank Goodness You're Here.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Which I just… I just don't get it. I just don't think it's funny.
I've tried and I sit there stony faced and there's nothing worse than being like the one person who isn't laughing. You can't be like, all these other people are wrong. They can't be wrong.
They're all laughing and having a great time. So you just sort of have to shut the fuck up and just not be like a negative presence. No one wants to hear it.
Yeah. Apart from on this podcast. Yeah.
It was funny when we talked about it and I did the whole, some of my best friends are Northern joke when discussing this. Yeah. I almost had that in the I Wish You Well Award for I Won't Be Participating In This kind of thing.
But I guess I did actively participate. Thank goodness you're here. I don't think the critics got that wrong though.
I think that comedy is just an acquired taste and you either will click with it or you won't. I didn't quite click with it but I absolutely support its existence. I believe in something like that existing, something idiosyncratic like that in a tonal way.
So I don't regret chucking money at it at all. I'm glad to have given it a go. Yeah.
So I agree with Matthew. Star Wars Outlaws is my main one for this. I think this is a good AAA game but press were quite down on it.
I mean, they have polished up since then. I'm hoping that leads to some kind of reappraisal for it. Maybe like if it would come out like two or three years ago, the reception would have been a bit different.
But yeah, I quite like this. I've not finished it still but I've played, I think 22 hours of it and I really like it. Again, if I could, if I'd finished it, it would have been a candidate for my top 10 for the year.
It probably won't get on there but I think it's probably an eight where most people gave it a seven. Then the other one I was going to mention was the other way around. I only played three hours of it but I think Animal Well was the biggest Emperor's New Clothes moment for me this year.
That was a proper like, the critics all got on a Discord and had a great time and then gave this like nine or ten out of ten and I just do not see the magic of this. It's a rudimentary Metroidvania to me. Like with, I don't know what, some secrets that are buried ten plus hours into it.
I mean in the immediate future I just see some Metroidvania drudgery. I don't really see it. Nice art direction though.
Go on Matthew.
Yeah, I mean I can sort of see how you've come to that conclusion and I get that the Discord thing was smoked. I was part of that Discord and came to dislike quite a few people in there because it was so smoked. And the people who then wrote articles about how fun it was to be in the Discord, I mean that was kind of grim.
Great marketing though.
I didn't have much time for that. But I do really rate that game. There's a good chance it will be brought up in our next episode so we can relitigate that then.
Yeah, fair enough. So yeah, I thought I'd put that in for a bit of balance. It's a game I really just did not click with this year.
Yeah, that's fine.
But you know what was cool? The spooky animals and how damp it felt. Those things were cool.
It does have nice pixel arts. So I will definitely give it that. OK, Matthew, then let's cut to one of our guests talking about one of their favorite games from this year.
Hey, Jay Bayless here, game designer, friend of the pod and Sonic the Hedgehog lore understander. My game of the year is Bellatro. It's tough to talk about Bellatro without saying things that you've already heard before.
So I think the thing that I like the most about Bellatro is that it shows that game design is not like a solved problem, you know? There's still amazing ideas out there just waiting to be conjured into being. Bellatro is something that could have theoretically existed like 30 years ago and it simply didn't because no one had thought of it yet.
I don't know, I just find that really inspiring in a way. It's also the only game that I've ever played so much that I gave myself severe eye strain playing because of all the tiny Joker text, so much so that I had to book an eye test at Boots. So yeah, Merry Christmas everyone!
Welcome back to the podcast. Here's an award that I have jammed in here. The Nintendo Heads Award for Most Offensive Customers.
Anyone who bought a LARMO for 90 quid then claimed it was for their kids. People got so defensive about buying a LARMO and being like, well actually it's not just a clock, it plays up to 10 different tunes or whatever. I was just like, nah, that was a hard no from me.
Where do you stand on a LARMO, Matthew?
There's a chance I might get one for Christmas. I don't know. I haven't asked for it.
There's a chance that might happen, so I'm not going to dunk on it. If one presented itself to me, I wouldn't say no. Yeah, like, it's an alarm clock that does Nintendo sounds.
That's fine.
This is a kind of overpriced frivolity you'd normally rally against, I think. It's sort of like, I feel like it'd be Nintendo maybe counting it break.
As someone who has really struggled to think of anything meaningful to ask for for Christmas, the idea of a goofy Nintendo alarm clock, that's the only time I would ever accept it as a gift, you know? Right, yeah. But I think you are right.
Did you, I don't know if you follow or have followed this year's computer game show Game of the Year shenanigans?
I haven't listened to the draft yet, but I do, I did read that Alarm OS was in the draft as a wildcard, is that right?
Yeah, so Alarm, yeah, well, it was in the draft as a wildcard and I think it won the wildcard draft.
That's pretty funny. That's good.
So that definitely goes through, but I think the other games in the wildcard draft were like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, so that's out. And, I understand, the other three were quite legit and now they're just not in the conversation, so fucking Alarm-o.
It's Alarm-o there, but like Astro Bot's not. Now Astro Bot will win from them.
That must have been through. I can't remember what the other wildcards are.
Amazing. Yeah, I always enjoy those episodes. I'm going for a walk after this podcast.
I might listen to that as I walk up the bath one big hill.
Well, I'm sorry to have spoiled some of the drama of it.
No, it's all about the interactions, isn't it? So the sort of like Dave Turner's psychological warfare. That's what I'm tuning in for.
So it's all good, Matthew. Yeah. Okay.
So that was my one, Matthew. Another one here is most surprising game of this year for better or worse. This is a nice idea for an award.
This might have been last year as well. I can't remember. But what did you get for this?
So I had two things. One was my reappraisal of The Last of Us Part II. I just thought it was a bit of an eye opener playing the remastered version and actually having a much better time with it.
Now that I kind of knew what was coming, I think the first playthrough, also in the midst of like COVID chaos, I think there was just a lot of stuff going on around when that game came out. I had a lot more appreciation for it this time and I absolutely devoured all the special features on that remastered version, the commentary and the deleted scenes. Like I just, I went all in on it.
It's not a surprise that that's a good game. I knew it was a good game, but I kind of finally kind of locked in on it, which was nice.
Did that remaster come out this year? Is that out? Is that like available?
Yeah, it came out in January.
Oh, did it? Oh, sorry, I missed that.
It was like one of the first releases of the year, I think. It was like January the 10th.
Oh, maybe I did know that. I just forgot. That's probably the case.
I think I maybe got confused with the last of us one redo they did. Yeah. Anyway, carry on.
Sorry.
So that was good. Most surprising game, for worse for me, was Metaphoric Fantasio. Just how little it moved the needle on Hashino's established formula.
And I've seen some people dismiss my dismissing of it as, oh, that's someone who just likes Japanese teenagers in school. And that didn't really, I think that that didn't quite kind of grasp what I was talking about. They didn't quite understand and understand what I was saying.
I don't think anyone who thinks that doesn't know you, frankly.
I specifically think the time structure and the social calendar aspect of this game, which is underpins everything in it, makes way more sense in a contemporary situation where time is sort of your enemy a little bit when you've got lots of shit to do as a teenager. And that's the only point I was making. I just think this is a really drab fantasy game.
It's got enough intrigue going for it in its overarching story that it's kept me playing through it. I haven't quite finished this one yet. But I just felt it so flat in so many ways and then to hear people just lauding it and saying how sophisticated it was, it became stuck in my craw a little bit.
Again, it's like the not quite getting, thank goodness you're here, but on a way bigger scale and having people lecture me on how sophisticated this was when people tweeting like, if only we could have games as politically sophisticated as this, and then a screenshot of a fucking man who's half man, half dog going, oh, I hate it that we look down on others. And you're like, oh, yeah, that's so grown up. Thank you for this sophisticated political discourse.
The celebration around this game has just been a really bad hang. I've been listening to some gaming podcasts, and when it comes up, just hearing people go gargoyle for it, I'm like, I just don't get it. This is my Emperor's New Clothes Awards.
It's yours as Animal Well. This is mine, like 100%. Very frustrating, because it feels like just an invitation to continue on like this, where actually I needed people to say no, so that he goes and makes the amazing game I'm sure he's capable of making.
Interesting, because I think the difference between this and Animal Well is that I have played three hours of Animal Well. You have persisted through metaphor. You've played tens of hours of this game.
You've properly put the time in. So it's a very well-founded take that you have here. Yeah, I did wonder in the moment whether it would get all those nines and tens and then maybe perception of it would dim a little bit as time passes on.
Whereas I feel like the Persona 5 thing was a bit accumulative in terms of reputation. I feel like that snowballed as it came to more formats and more and more people discovered it. I don't know.
But yeah, interesting. I've still got it to play at some point, Matthew, but it's not, thanks to you, it's gone to the bottom of the pile.
Well, lots of people will tell you that's wrong. I just think it's wrong. I think if we had an alternative award for best publisher or best studio, whatever we're describing it as, I think Atlus has had an otherwise incredible year.
Yeah. I think Shin Megami Tensei V, Persona 3 Reload, Unicorn Overlord. They've made four massive amazing RPGs according to everyone.
I just think metaphor is the weakest of them.
Yeah. Persona 3 Reload is a game that I just didn't play because I've played enough of three that I didn't feel an urgency to play this. But I did about three hours of it on Game Pass.
It's such a generously rendered redo of that game. It gives you everything you could want from it, I think. Maybe other than the female protagonist.
Is that a thing in the Persona 3? One of the versions they did? I can't remember.
Yeah, it doesn't. Yeah, that was something. Some people had beef with that game because they feel like it wasn't the complete package.
Right. But for most people, that would be close enough.
But I didn't have a huge amount of experience with it before, so I was just sort of, you know, wowed by all the music afresh and, you know, the set up of it is quite weird and the central dungeon striking. So yeah, I had a pretty good time with it. I still need to finish it, I will add.
Okay. Well, that's okay, Matthew, because you finish every other game from this year. So that's all good.
Okay. In which case then, my most surprising game of the year, I've only got one here for better. I have to give this to UFO 50, because even though this was what they sold, it was 50 games for a fictional console, it constantly surprises you, because the variety of the games and the richness of them, and the fact that some are just easier to love than others.
I think it's just so generous in terms of content, but also generous in terms of spirit this game, I think. It's just very spiritually generous, if that makes sense. Just that kind of thing of like, we've curated something amazing to delight you constantly, and to, you know, for each disc or cart you dust off to offer some kind of like, fresh, you know, even every time you'd sort of go onto like, the menu screen for these fake games, it feels exciting.
And I think that that's why it deserves to have this particular award, Matthew. Wish I had a jokey one, but I don't, UFO 50, pretty cool game, so here it goes.
I'm struggling with that one a little bit, with the Game of the Year episode.
Because it's hard to have played everything in it.
I haven't played much more of it from when we first talked about it, just because of the time commitment element. Like it's that, or five other games. Yeah, I don't really want to do with it, to be honest.
Yeah, I see it as this, I considered it qualifying, if I managed to get, I think it was gold, on at least two of the games, and I have managed that. So that, I think means that, I think that's like engaging with it enough to feel like you can put it in there, but I totally get that. It's not a game you can easily get your arms around, but it's okay also to pick two favorites and be like, it's really cool that this happened this year.
That's worth celebrating. It's not worth overthinking, but yeah, definitely the most surprising. Okay, Matthew, time for another recommendation from one of this year's guests.
Hello, lads. It's Cass here. Thank you so much for having me on the pod the other week to talk about my mag and other bits and bobs.
And congratulations on yet another fantastic year of two lads with a microphone goodness. Matthew asked me to say a little bit about what kind of game I was thinking were good this year in terms of like game of the year stuff. I thought rather than pick something that would be a bit more obvious, I'm going to pick go with a heart pick for this year.
So I'm being vulnerable with you guys right now. And that game is Sonic X Shadow Generations. Now before you will burn your copies of A Profound Waste of Time, just please hear me out on this because that game is, it's just really nice to have a Sonic game that is unambiguously good.
And something I've had to sort of reckon with is that, okay, look, we're all going to have to sort of reconcile at some point, us as a society, that a whole generation of young children, very impressionable children, played Sonic Adventure 2 when they were very young. And they got to the end of that game and they heard Live and Learn, the soundtrack to The Final Boss, and their brain chemistry was changed forever. And I'm sadly one of those kids, is what I've had to reckon with.
And it's very debatable whether an edgy black and red hedgehog, who dealt with government conspiracies and dead, immunocompromised children, should be part of the Sonic franchise in the first place. But there's no putting the genie back in the bottle now that that's happened. So I guess it's quite fun seeing Sonic Team transition into this kind of like new era, where they seem unashamed about the history of the franchise.
In fact, they're sort of embracing it in quite a nice way. And in the spirit of that, I'm trying to be unashamed and embrace the fact that I did unironically really enjoy that game this year. Anyway, I hope you'll still talk to me next year after that little reveal.
And I'm just wishing you and your listeners a really fantastic Christmas and New Year. And I'll see you guys in 2025.
Back to it then. Most spectacular set piece, Matthew. What do you got?
Well, actually, having just dunked on metaphor, I will say when it kicks off at the end of the prologue, which you can play in the free trial, it sort of establishes what the story is going to be about. There's a failed assassination attempt, but what stops that assassination attempt is quite bizarre. And you suddenly get sort of four or five quite strange plot revelations all at once, and you finally understand the shape and stakes of the game.
In that moment, I was like, oh, this is this is just banging. This is great. I'm having such a good time.
And it took a long time to get to another moment where I thought it had any any kind of like concentration of ideas that were that interesting. But that was admittedly, you know, it was very good. It's still a good game.
That's what I should keep saying. It's still a good metaphor. It's just not the ten that people say it is anyway.
Really, I think the most spectacular set piece is one which is hard to talk about without spoiling. It's in Indiana Jones. I'll say it's the Himalayas set piece.
And what follows directly after that? Again, it's kind of where the plot of the game, you know, like the MacGuffin sort of reveals its hand. And you suddenly understand what the stakes are a little bit.
It also does something which I think if they did it in the films I wouldn't necessarily have liked it. Like, it's quite a big swing. But there's something about the, like, the unreality of being in a video game that actually allows this particular plot development to, like, for you not even to blink that it's happened and just enjoy it.
Yeah, it's like a… in a game which really takes its time, it's like they suddenly throw loads of budget at, like, one 10-minute sequence to make it absolutely balmy. And I thought that was, like, really, really spectacular.
Interesting, Matthew. I hear it's a good game.
Yes, I know Indiana Jones is a tricky one. Sam's closeness to it. But I will be its sole cheerleader and, yeah, tell you it is good and that it might be appearing in our next episode.
Okay, so do we count level in this award, Matthew, set piece? So does that come later?
It has hub, hub slash best level down the line.
That makes sense and that's fine. Okay, set piece then. I got to say this, I think it's the last level in Space Marine 2 has both these bits in it.
And I will say there's some spoilers follow here. There's your spoiler warning for Space Marine 2. If you've not played it, go play it.
It's absolutely great 360 era scripted set piece throwback. It's full of like great moments, I would say. There's a bit where a dreadnought crashes through a wall.
That's really, really cool in this game. But the sort of king set piece is there's a bit at the end where this like Lord of Change chaos thing comes through a big portal. It's like Kaiju sized in the distance and loads of like Ultramarine lads basically like former kind of like battalion and unload loads of gunfire at once while holding this flag up.
Like it's a Civil War painting or something. It's ridiculous, but a very sort of like fun moment that I imagine for Warhammer 40,000 fans was probably quite cool to see rendered just with the sort of like budget they've put into it. I really love that.
I think Space Marine 2 is great for set pieces. It's got some really, really good ones. At first I thought the first couple of levels I wasn't quite feeling it, but I really locked into it.
And yeah, certainly by the end, I think it really gives you everything you want from that that kind of experience. So that gets it, Matthew. I haven't got anything for the next award though, which is best bit in a bad game.
I don't think I played a bad game this year. Did you?
This first game isn't outright bad, but the absolutely batshit crazy ultra-violent epilogue to Eme Over Smiling Man, a Famicom detective sequel on the Switch that is incredibly sedate for the meat of its 12-hour runtime and then kind of gives you a bit of a sort of trigger warning at the end and then really goes for it in a way which I've not really seen in a Nintendo game. We talked about this in what we've been playing. You can go back and I tell Sam in more detail if you want to hear about it.
But that was a real pleasant surprise. I think for me that for the best bit against bad game, I kind of feel for this game a little bit. But I thought Suicide Squad Kills Justice League had some really good moments where they sort of sell the power of the Justice League.
I think whatever happened with the overall design of that game and whatever Rock said he wanted to do, they were always very good at capturing the fantasy of being Batman and nailing the characterisation of certain villains or their interpretation of the villains was really neat in those games. And I think they kind of applied that eye to the Justice League. Obviously, the Justice League are evil.
So there's this constant thing of like when they turn up in cutscenes, there is always this like wonder at the Justice League paired with a, oh shit, it's this guy, like there's a bit with Captain Boomerang, where Superman first turns up and does something very sort of superman-y. And Captain Boomerang is just like, oh my god, it's Superman. And he's like a child again.
And then he's instantly like, oh shit, it's Superman. This is the guy we've got to kill. And in a game about killing the gods of comic books, I think that was like a really crucial ingredient.
So for all its flaws, I thought they really nailed that element of it.
How's the Green Lantern set piece in there? So I imagine that's got quite a lot of video game potential. A hard character to nail in live action, but I imagine probably pretty good in this game.
The fight itself is okay. A lot of giant green things.
Sounds like Green Lantern.
Oh, there's a big machine gun in the sky shooting at you and like, I think he magics up some sort of planes to do like a bombing run on you and stuff. Like at the end of the day, it is like an arena based boss fight for all these things. We're just jumping around, dodging their attacks.
Like weirdly, it's more of a cut scene thing.
Well, Green Lantern Hal Jordan is a test pilot, Matthew. So him calling in planes makes sense. Show a bit of bloody respect.
Sorry, my fad. The Wonder Woman is really good in Justice League. She's not turned evil.
She's trying to kill the other members of the Justice League. And she has a really good fight with Superman, which I just really enjoyed. You know, in the game, those were the highlights, which is very rare for me that I'm looking forward to the cut scenes.
Yeah, well, it's nice that some of that Rocksteady DNA is present in there. I feel like that game had such a tough time this year. And here it gets put in best bit in a bad game by Matthew Castle.
No, but that's why I don't like it if anyone from Rocksteady is listening to this. It's really said with utmost respect and love.
Yeah, I meant to play this because people said the open world was pretty impressive as well. The way you navigate it is quite fun and very Rocksteady-ish. So yeah, I meant to get to it, but I just prioritized other stuff when it got...
A lot of things came along quite quickly this year.
Yeah, it's hard. And you read the stories about the concurrence and you were like, hmm, probably shouldn't.
The fucking concurrence stories, the scourge of the internet, Matthew. Okay, in which case, Matthew, let's have another quick break there for a recommendation from one of our guests.
Hello, Back Page friends, this is Andy Kelly and my Game of the Year is almost certainly Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. I didn't really know what to expect from it. I was gearing up for a kind of first person uncharted, which would have been fine actually.
But instead I got this weird, unexpected mix of genres and gameplay styles with elements of Dishonored and Hitman and Escape from Butcher Bay and Broken Sword-esque point and click adventure puzzles, which wasn't a nice surprise but I really should have expected it from Machine Games. I mean, look at what they did with Wolfenstein taking this established series and giving it a completely fresh and unique twist. And the fact that it's all wrapped up in a really fun, rip roaring, classic Indiana Jones, globe trotting adventure is just a bonus really.
It's clear Machine Games loves the source material and that just shines through in like every second of play. I honestly think it's the most interesting licensed game since Alien Isolation. And yeah, well done Machine Games.
Welcome back. I keep saying that in quite a solemn way, the let's have a cut to one of our guests.
We just had some fun input.
Yeah, that's it. Some nice input. I think this is because I could, I think last year we went, we overdosed on the ding dongs and all that stuff.
And I think it was a little bit too sort of like Noel's house party ish. And I just wanted to dial that back by about 20% to dee-lobby it by 30%. Okay, Matthew, we have a worst bit in a great day in the inverse of our last award.
What have you got for this one?
The lava level with the duck in Astrobot.
Oh, great call, great call.
That's the only genuinely ranked bit of that. To power up, that doesn't quite behave and you've got to use it in an incredibly precise level. It's a duck that sprays water that hardens lava, but the arc of the water and the physics of that hardening, it's not where it needs to be for the challenge presented, I don't think.
It's the only bit of that game where I was like, oof, this is quite off.
Yeah, I'm glad a bit of time has passed since I finished Astrobot before we do the Game of the Year podcast because I can reframe how I feel about it again a little bit with a bit of hindsight. I've played that Christmas level this week and I thought it's quite delightful, reminded me of why that game is so good. But yes, this level is bad.
I think that the duck thing, I think what would help is if the duck had a very precise arc and you could see exactly where it would land, like with 100 percent accuracy. So the area of effect you felt like you had a complete understanding and control of, but yes, the edges are a bit odd and it doesn't seem to always cover everything as much as you want it to. It's just that first bit with the two spinning fire things, and that first bit is an absolute fucker.
Yeah, I'm amazed I got through that without destroying a PS5 controller this year, to be honest. So great call, Matthew. Great call.
I've got a couple for this. This is recency bias. I just did a room full of bugs in Silent Hill 2 Remake's prison, Toluca Prison bit that I fucking hated.
Do you know the room I mean, Matthew, where the door locks behind you, and loads of bugs turn up, and every few seconds, there's a flash of light and then more bug enemies turn up to attack you?
I think you're a little bit ahead of me now in Silent Hill 2.
Oh, I thought you finished it. Have you not?
No, no.
Okay. I majorly misjudged that. Yeah.
The solution to the puzzle is quite straightforward, but I would say the game gaslights you into thinking. There's a different answer to it because there are these bits of light. There's a puzzle earlier in the game where you're looking for some glowing writing on a wall to solve a puzzle, and I thought that was the solution here because there are these bits of lit surface that pop up and keep moving around the room.
I kept looking at those thinking, is the number going to appear there somehow? But the solution was actually way simpler than that. That bit was genuinely the only terrible bit of that game so far, I think, so that's one I've just picked.
But I also did want to give a shout out to the final boss of Peppergrinder, a game that's not going to be in my top 10 for the game of the year, but a game I really liked from this year. I think the difficulty for this game is completely well judged and then the final boss is an absolute pain in the dick, so that has to go in here. I would say that boss ruined a Sunday night for me this year.
Obviously I was expecting some Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in here. I also wrote down the worst bit in a great game, I mean you have many bits you don't like about it but one bit for me was Kate Sith in the Shinra Mansion.
I still think the bit with the G before that was worse than that bit.
Oh, there's one fight in Shinra Mansion, it's not even a boss, it's just an enemy, it's that thing which is like a scales, it's like an adjudicator or something and it just has an instant kill move and the combination of me not really understanding what it was doing and me not really understanding how to use Kate Sith because I hadn't used it at all for the rest of the game, it was just…
Horrible.
I died on that room against a common enemy more than I did any boss in that game.
Yes, the adjudicator was bad. The Yin and Yang boss fight that follows, the two-headed lad, almost dropped the difficulty with that one but didn't in the end, stuck to it and against my better judgement. Yeah, there's been a few this year for this one Matthew, so that's good.
The Did This Need A Remake Or Remaster Award, what you got Matthew?
Shadows of the Damned.
Oh yeah, that's a good one, it's already on backwards compatibility through Xbox, it felt like that was fine to me, and it didn't seem like it was much of an upgrade either?
No, just like a huge shrug and no one cared, and they got Suda 51 and Macami over to Gamescom for it. A weird amount of noise around something which is like remastering a 7 at best, I just don't know what they thought they were going to achieve with it. It was weird because this year also had Lollipop Chainsaw, it's been a bit of a Suda 51 resurgence, but neither of them sort of made a splash I don't think.
I put Lollipop Chainsaw for the simple reason of if you don't have the music there's no point in doing that remaster. Like the music is part of the DNA of that game. So that is the most pointless remake or remaster to me.
I will say I thought you would put Epic Mickey for this, but I think that actually was worth remastering. That's a bit of a curio that people who didn't have a Wii at the time would probably want to check out I think, but I know you're not the fondest of it.
I think they've given it quite tidy controls as well. Like people think it plays just a bit better and they've done quite a nice job polishing it up.
Yeah, good, cool. Suda is kind of like the winner of this. I don't think he has any involvement with our Lollipop Chainsaw, to be honest.
So I don't want to pin that on him, our guy Suda51. In which case, Matthew, how about one more recommendation from a contributor from this year?
Hello, first man. Hello, second man. It's me, the third man, Jeremy Peel.
I'm here to recommend one of my favorite games of this year. It's called Wild Bastards. And it's a Roguelite FPS from one of my favorite indie studios, Blue Manchu.
It's directed by one of the co-founders of Irrational, John Chay. And basically you're guiding a team of outcast cowpokes through the galaxy, through the squabbles to bring the gang back together. And you do that by having a bunch of tiny FPS battles across a big tactical map.
Even though it's a shooter, it really captures that XCOM feel of enemy unknown to me. And you gradually get to know your opponents better. And it's a really great sense of mastery that comes with that.
You shouldn't take my word for it. PC Gamer gave it 91% and called it the best Blender Vroguelike in FPS since Deathloop. And I've just checked the byline and that was me as well.
Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas one and all.
Onwards then. The What a Cool Mechanic Made Just For This Game Award. What have you got Matthew?
I really liked the XP multiplier combo system in Flintlock. A sort of acrobatic Souls-likey type thing, which like Souls-likey games, has a currency that when you die you lose. But on top of collecting the currency, every different move you do adds like a combo multiplier to that amount.
So you're encouraged to really mix up long-range combat, close quarters combat, your acrobatic skills, and also go as long as you can without banking those Souls. It's not just when you die, it's you choose to like bank them yourself. And I just thought that made you think about all the moves in the game.
I thought it added a risk reward beyond simply if I get hit or I die what happens. I thought Flitlock had some… It was clearly the work of a team who are really into that genre and had thought very hard about how to mix it up.
Maybe didn't quite find the right imaginary world to hook people in or anything, but certainly not a disaster, like an interesting game. I think it was a Kepler one that. And they're like the home of lots of these games you go to for ideas, which is cool.
Like that, Ultros and Pacific Drive.
Yeah, like Sifu was one of theirs as well. That's like the crown jewel of theirs.
That definitely landed it.
Yeah, Pacific Drive was an interesting game. I think that game did land for people who liked that sort of more pernickety customization stuff. I think that's what it comes down to.
If you have the patience to engage with that, I think Pacific Drive is a very rewarding game. I think Ultros is a very rewarding game if you go on the journey with that as well.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, I think Flitlock was the one that probably got the coolest critical reception out of those. But also it was stepping into the most competitive genre, wasn't it? So it was tricky work.
Yeah, it's quite a bid for mainstream success, I get. And it still had a lot going for it. I really liked the movement in it and flying around that world and the way the world unfolded, because you had this strange almost gliding teleportation warp.
And it meant you ended up going really high above the levels in places that you didn't think you would go. And not a boring game. I thought that was neat.
I also liked the slow-mo power in Astro Bot. I mean, it's a bit basic bitch, like bullet time, but the stopping the level and having lots of fast moving level effects which you suddenly reveal the truth of them in slow motion and hitting enemies and watching them. The sort of slow-mo particle effects of spit leaving their mouths and things.
I just thought it was really, really well executed.
Yeah, I agree. That felt like you were seeing another world that was occurring between the seconds of the rest of the level, which feels like a special effect in and of itself. So I really like that as well.
I actually picked the dropping in Helldivers 2. Just landing on an enemy or a friend on the way down like this.
Or a friend. That was a very earlier point about getting kicked out of friendship group.
Well, it's that thing of everything in the game feels like it's tailored to just add to the joy of playing with friends and enjoying that kind of co-op experience. And this feels like just such a well-judged addition in that respect. You could have had such a blander way of respawning, but obviously they are Helldivers.
They do drop from space and it just fits it so, so well. So this felt like a good fit for that reason, Matthew. It also feels exciting.
It means that when you die and you come back, you don't feel like a loser. You feel like empowered to rejoin the fight and you have, you know, you are a weapon as you come back into combat. It's just a very well-judged mechanic to me.
So yeah, I like that one. Best hub world or area slash level, Matthew. There's a lot going on here, but basically a level kind of award.
What you got for this one?
Yeah, I really like the bathhouse stage in Astrobot, the one where you turn into the big sponge lad.
Oh yeah, that's good.
You sort of inflate by absorbing water. This game has some like crazy water physics. It has bits where water goes down a ramp and cleans away mud, which was just a crazy sort of playful, tactile bit of sort of alchemy that I really enjoyed.
As someone who struggles with smaller baths in most places, just a fantasy world where all the baths could absorb and take a giant man. That's the dream, isn't it?
Yeah, that's a good call. I was going to put the casino level here for Astrobot. I think as like a proof of concept of why should this game exist, it's the best reason you'll find.
I was showing someone the other day like, oh, I think you'll like this game and here's why I think you'll like this game. I just loaded up the casino level and it's just so dazzling. There's just a few signature levels in Astrobot that really show what it does better than any other and I think in some ways those levels are so good they almost expose some of the cracks in the other levels that don't quite reach that same standard.
Right. But that's like a bit of an unfair criticism to level at it because I think it's very good at accentuating the good things about it. But yeah, there's just a few highlights in there, isn't there?
I wanted to call out the Call of Duty Black Ops 6 level Emergence, the aka the control level set in a lab. Hard to describe without spoiling, but I would say...
You should do it. I just want to hear about it. Just tell me.
Okay, I'll just tell you. So it is like control in the sense that you are in this sort of clandestine government organization sort of building. I think the setup is you are looking for these four key cards, which have been sort of looked after by these different commanders or officers who are in this facility, and then you go off and get them.
And they are basically, again, spoilers here, supernatural fights essentially. So the most memorable one is this room full of these dummies slash mannequins that when you don't look at them, they run after you, you can hear them running after you. And it's very, very unsettling.
You just hear this sort of clutter of noise turn around and there's like 30 dummies running towards you. And it's like, when they get near you, they just start battering you to death basically. There's a few genuinely monster battles or Bioshock-y kind of enemies in there.
You got all that mixed with like, it's a game where they, it's a level where they debut a grappling hook. And what happens is, I think it's strongly implied that you, the protagonist, come from this facility. And so it's you returning home to where you were made, basically.
That's the suggestion of the story, which I thought landed really well. And it just, basically, they just use this as a, a chance to have like a really big swing and do something a bit different. And the last enemy you fight is like contained in this, this is where I felt really Bioshock-y, like in this water kind of feel like a prison in the middle of water, almost like kind of like Magneto's plastic prison in X-Men, but like in the middle of water.
So you know that when you drain this and the enemy comes out, you're basically like chaos is going to ensue. It doesn't quite get to that sort of like 10 out of 10 level in a mechanics way, but as something that really stretches the boundaries of what you can do with Call of Duty, I think it really deserves a kind of, you know, a bit of a claim. And I think it has been called out as like one of the highlights of the campaign.
So I really like that. But the Mannequins are the most memorable because I think there's just a few of them at first, and then you don't quite realize what's going on. You think it's some kind of like weird simulation setting, but then you start to notice them moving, and it's just very effective.
It's like a kind of the Weeping Angels thing, you know, but it worked really well.
Yeah, I was going to say it sounded a bit dog's a hoot.
Yeah, very much so. So definitely a bunch of influences going into it. But yeah, it's like it is Lydia, but it's a bit more structured, a bit more like a persistent space because you go back and forth to some of the same areas different times with the grappling hook and different paths open up and stuff.
And yeah, I don't know. It was cool. So that goes in there as well, Matthew.
Anything else to call out here or should we move on?
Let's move on.
Okay, should we have another break here and have a guest drop in?
Yeah, let's do that.
Let's go. Ding dong. Here we go.
Hey, this is James Milky and this is my Game of the Year. I actually had to go into my Steam year and wrap up for a little help with this because I honestly couldn't remember which game I played the most of. But as it turns out, and this completely makes sense to me, it was Dragon Quest XI.
I do realize that this game is many, many years old, but this was the year that it finally clicked for me. I actually tried to get into Dragon Quest XI probably about, I don't know, three or four times. And I always just bounced off it pretty hard because the opening bits are a bit tedious.
And I don't know, I have a short attention span. But this year, it finally clicked with me. And up until this point, my favorite Dragon Quest had actually been Dragon Quest IX on DS.
Because I was really impressed with how Diablo-esque that game was. And with all those little 3D models, changing any of your gear or whatever was reflected on your character. But with Dragon Quest XI, while you don't really get a lot of that cosmetic stuff, the depth of the game is so tremendous to me and the amount of side quests and contextual things that unlock as you're playing it.
Just the constant sense of adventure and things to do. I mean, I really, really began to appreciate how, on what level Yuji Horii operates. And it's really incredible to see all the systems baked into that ever evolving and improving series.
It went from a game that I bounced off of three or four times to a game that's easily in my top 20, possibly top 10 games of all time now. And I remember that I still need to go back and finish it on Steam. I've finished it on Switch, probably put a couple hundred hours into it on Switch and have done the same on Steam Deck just because it looks way better.
And I need to go beat that final boss. But Steam Deck really transformed the way I play that game. It looks so nice and it was always fun to pop in, grind a little experience out and just get my level up and go through all the really cool dungeons and encounters.
I don't know, I could go on for an hour about that game. But honestly, that's the game of the year for me. I'm a little late to the party, but I think it is absolutely fantastic.
And I think I'm going to get back to it now. So thanks for reminding me.
OK then, next up, best boss fight. I didn't even have one for this. I'm not sure I've fought a good boss this year, Matthew, which is a brutal thing to say.
There's some really good ones in Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown. They're really like Dragon Ball Z-esque kind of fights. But most of the time, I was just so angry at how much I was dying or so locked in to just trying to beat them.
I couldn't really appreciate them. But when you watch them back, some of the animations are really spectacular. Just these like crazy kill moves and just really big showy sort of like posturing effects and QTE attacks and stuff.
What have you got for this?
I picked Like A Dragon Infinite Wealth. Small spoilers, but I imagine if you care about these things, you will have played this game. You fight, as Kiryu, you end up fighting sort of three figures from his past all at once.
Majima, Tiger, Sejima and Dago. These three guys turning up, it's a bit of a kind of Avengers sort of mic drop moment when they turn up in the game anyway, because you're like, oh, these guys are here. And you have this fight with them and there comes a point where each of their health bars is low enough that Kiryu kind of goes into sort of drops his turn based battling and switches into just like his old school brawling and brawls with them for a bit.
But you're shifted from the arena you were fighting in to this sort of dream space where the sky is lit up with scenes with those characters from all the past games. It's like literally like your lifetime with this specific character flashing in front of your eyes. And it's just incredibly epic.
A lot of Infinite Wealth is like a huge victory lap for Kiryu particularly and his relationship with certain locations and characters and for them to really find a way to kind of communicate that in this boss fight. I thought I just thought it was it was so good. I was like, oh, this is this is genuine art.
That's cool. I like the idea of that a lot. And that has shades of fighting off slot at the end of MGS4, Matthew.
Yeah, very much like that, actually. It's kind of tapping into the same thing. It's not the hardest fight.
I didn't find it, you know, nightmarishly hard. But there's a fight with Majima in Like a Dragon before Infinite Wealth. And it's like a horrible difficulty spike.
And so the joy of him turning up instantly turns to absolute misery. You have to go and grind for hours. And this one, the joy of them turning up is then matched by the quality of the fight.
And it just works much better.
Nice. That does sound cool. At some point, I'll get through these two latest Yakuza games.
Oh, they're so long.
They are long. Yeah. But it would be nice to be able to have some kind of grounding with them, just because this year's one got so much acclaim.
So, OK, good call, Matthew. I decided that the next category didn't have a good enough category named Banger on the Soundtrack Awards. So I'm renaming this the Hope for the Future Award for most banging tune, Matthew.
So for the future.
So obviously, that was your biggest musical revelation of this year. But what else did you have here?
The extraction music in Helldivers 2.
Oh, that is good. Good, cool.
It's like proper Mission Impossible. That brass band begins to be got three minutes or wherever it is. And it's going to be rad as shit.
And then we're going to get out of here. Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. And you're just like, this is this is great.
I think that's an MCU coded soundtrack personally.
Very much so.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I actually really like the music in Bellatro. And I don't know if that's Stockholm Syndrome, but that dreamy background track is just something I've listened to, obviously, for a stupid amount this year playing Bellatro.
And when they played the orchestral version of it at the Game Awards, as part of the Game of the Year nominee medley, right, it sounded so fucking good. I was just like, that's all I want to listen to is that tune played by an orchestra. Like, if they don't patch that in somehow, it would be a crying shame.
My one observation about that is it's both. It is a great tune, but it is also Stockholm Syndrome. Like it's those things combined.
That is your relationship with that music, I think. But it does deserve calling out, I think, for that reason. Like it's really hard to design basically one piece of music to play for hours and hours and hours without it driving you completely mad.
And that is arguably one of its signature achievements that they're able to do that. So yeah, well done to them.
That's a good call, Matthew. Anything else you want to put here? And music is something you think about a lot when you listen to games, to play games.
I think Rebirth's got amazing music throughout, I agree, but I love the Cosmo Canyon battle theme, where the Cosmo Canyon turns into this really big jaunty number. I like all the music in that, Queen's Blood, I like that music.
That's good music.
I like the weird Earth song of Gongaga.
Yeah, I think I like the regular Cosmo Canyon music quite a lot. One of my personal favorite bits of music from FF7, the original, and it is in Rebirth as well, is the motorcycle chase music from that one set piece outside of Midgar. I fucking love that music from the original.
I don't think that's ever really called out as a favorite, but I love that. The Costa del Sol music is great as well. I probably slightly prefer the original version.
I think I quite like its slightly midi-ish, plinky-plonky quality.
Purist, eh?
Yeah, so I agree. I think Rebirth does deserve a special shout out here. But my number one by default has to be Hit Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears in that particular Beat Saber pack.
Just a great bit of content from a game that is very well supported by good DLC. Not even remotely interested in the Metallica one that's just come out, but Britney Spears, I was there day one, man.
Swinging your arms, praying no one looks at you through the window.
Praying I close my curtains and that I remember to put my tracksuit bottoms on before playing. Lots to think about there, Matthew. Okay, a non-Hitman game location that would make a great Hitman level, Matthew.
I only added this because when I played a bit of Dead Rising Remastered, I was suddenly thinking why has there never been a Hitman level in a shopping mall? With all those objects to pick up, there is no more depth to my thinking than that.
Dare I say the Vatican in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?
The Vatican is a great level and people keep likening it to Hitman as well for a reason, like the social sort of stealth of it.
Well, in which case that makes sense. I don't really have one here, so that was my token suggestion to chuck in there.
Yeah.
Hello, Matthew here. I'm not trying to hijack the part of the episode intended for the guests, but I am here to tell you that the voice you're about to hear belongs to Dave Scarborough. Let's see what he has to say for himself.
Hello.
Thanks for having me back. So Game of the Year. I thought a lot about this in the last 12 minutes since I read your email.
And a lot of my favourite games I've jumped into over the last few months. So it's like Bellatro and Astro Bot and Indiana Jones. Those all I've only been playing recently.
But a game I absolutely adored and is the Game of the Year was probably also my Game of the Year back in 2022. And that's V-Rising, which had its 1.0 launch, I think, back in May this year or April. For me, this is the quintessential survival game.
I've fallen in love with this game several times over now. I've jumped into it for dozens of hours each year since the early access. 1.0 really impressed me just by the number of features they added, the amount of polish that went into it.
It felt more intuitive and streamlined in all the right ways. I just find it immensely addictive. And I love roaming around its Gothic fantasy world and slaying a bunch of gnarly monsters or sucking the blood out of helpless villagers.
It's just endlessly enjoyable for me and really gratifying. I will say there is a bit of a carrot and stick situation to it all, you know, where there's always just something better around the corner, whether it's a better weapon or better power or, you know, new carpet for your castle. But I also think it's just a really cosy game as well, something that you can just sort of kick back and spend hours just perfecting the eerie vampire castle that you're building.
And honestly, the only thing sadder than how much time I spent putting it into my vampire castle with its little indoor garden that I made was losing the whole thing when I forgot to keep my castle heart topped up, which was, yeah, that was really disappointing. I really, really enjoyed this game and I think it deserves more plaudits as I think it's kind of been ignored or forgotten given when it came out. And in fact, it was a 1.0 launch, but yeah, this was definitely my highlight of the year.
Game I played for 10 minutes on Game Pass and no more than that. So what you got for this one, Matthew?
Dungeons of Hintzeberg.
Yeah, I played this for about two or three hours, but I think this probably qualifies Kinnitsugami as well, is this for me as well?
I played Kinnitsugami, a decent chunk. I went to a preview event and I played a chunk of it at home. I haven't finished it.
I do dig it. I think it's cool. I'm just quite shit at it and I find it quite stressful.
Dungeons of Hintzeberg. I didn't really get what its deal was. I didn't really know if it was trying to be a platform or action game.
None of it was quite landing for me.
It's got a bit of Zelda, a bit of Persona, a little bit of a Kami in the look of it.
I don't think it does enough at the start to grab you with it. I feel like you have to maybe commit to it.
Yeah. I don't want to be mean to it because I feel like the setting really comes from a place of love. To pick the alps is quite an interesting idea for a setting and to get away from it all in the city, but it's quite weird, corrupted tourist space as well.
I liked it in theory more than I liked it when I played it. Okay. That's a good one, Matthew.
Best tip we can offer to improve any one game. This is a great idea for an award. I assume you put this in, Matthew.
This is good.
Yeah. Well, this is a tip I'm giving to people who are going to play a game.
Oh, I thought it was to the developers to change the game. That's how I interpret it.
You can interpret it however you want.
Okay. Sure. What do you got then?
There's a lot of Indiana Jones in this list, because that's what I've been playing recently. But if you are yet to play Indiana Jones, don't buy the guidebooks at the outset in Indiana Jones, because it puts all the hidden things on the map, and it becomes a bit more of a map clearing game, where actually part of the fun is being in those environments and looking around them, and finding things of your own volition. By all means, buy the guidebooks when you're mopping up in the end game, or once you've finished the main story of a level.
There were things I would have felt a bit miffed about if a mapper told me to find. So that is my tip to you.
Good call Matthew, that's good, yeah, I can see how…
It does mean you never use the currency. It means the whole currency system of the game is for nothing, and you've got like six grand in your pocket all level, which is weird. I think that's a small price to pay.
Well, I look forward to more of this slightly awkward meet it turd around this discussion next week.
Sorry, so I don't mean to keep putting you in there.
No, it's fine. So for this one, this is more tips to the developers, or at least things I would do, things one thing I would change to like two different games to improve them. At no point do I ever want my attacks cancelled in FF7 Rebirth.
That sucks, just because that exposes the weakness of the game's colliding turn-based combat and real-time action combat. That's where the game has not baked into the RPG mechanics, but because this boss has a bullshit animation, it cancels one of your attacks even though you spent the ATB bar to do it. Never cancel my attacks.
Even if you knock me over and I get up again, I should be able to use the move that I previously banked. That's how I feel about that. When that happens in the game, it's so frustrating.
It just really makes you feel powered down as a player. Because you didn't select the move out of the way of a bullshit animation by this enemy, you were punished for trying to use the move and didn't get to use it at all. I think it really betrays the RPG systems underneath it.
Deeper into the game, I found that more and more frustrating as it kept happening, Matthew. So that's one. The other one is, give Echoes of Wisdom shortcut keys for the different items you can summon and proper menus.
That's the one thing I'd change about that game. Is that fair?
Yeah, that's a much better use of this category than me telling people not to use an inbuilt guide system.
Mine should have been called the Backseat Game Designer Award for advice the developers never asked for. That would have been good. The Oh My God I Hope No One Walks In While I'm Playing This Award.
Brackets can be for prudish or cringe reasons. What have you got for this one, Matthew?
Stellar Blade.
Same. I also got this for shiniest ass in Unreal Engine 2024. So yes, Stellar Blade.
Is this the only award it comes up in this list, Matthew? It's not going to be a game of the year, but it was pretty good this year. I feel like if people bought this game, having bought a PS5, they'd have a pretty good time and feel all right about that purchase.
It was like a seven, right?
Yeah, as long as no one walks in.
Yeah, it's true.
That's the condition for enjoying it. There are costumes you can get that cover her up a bit more. There's a bear costume where she basically looks like a theme park mascot.
But there are other things which are, you know, it's very stylish, but a bit less scuzzy. So much of this game's like economy and unlocks are about buying, like, really grim costumes or costumes that certainly weren't to my taste. Which is annoying because, like, the more you play, you just realise that you're working towards maybe a quite a big chunk of the game you don't necessarily want to engage with.
But whatever. I thought this was a pretty decent Bayonetta alike, I guess. Had some good boss fights and I'm pleased I finished it.
I think that the last third of it's pretty strong.
Yeah, I wish I'd finished this. This might be, this is a candidate for me reinstalling it to go back to. I think I got probably about halfway through it.
Yeah, and I thought it was decent. I think like the slightly cutie-ish bits were where I was, a little bit more down on the combat for like some of the finishes and stuff, but I thought they got the combat basics down pretty well. The worst thing about Steleblade were the people talking about it on the internet, to be honest.
So, such as it is. Okay, Matthew, the Good For You Award for a game we acknowledge is good while choosing not to participate. What do you got for this one?
However you pronounce caves of quad.
That's great.
Cut.
Yeah. Quad. Quad.
Quad. Quad.
Quad. Quad. Like I get that it's the most amazing emergent experience ever, but it's just, I have the same thing with Dwarf Fortress, I just can't.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I haven't got good enough imagination to enjoy it.
Yeah, I like that. I've got Sheeran the Wanderer for this. This is a game for people who have bought all other video games.
That's my theory. I think they're like, this is the game that will somehow blow my brain wide open, because I've bought every other game and I'm not sure. I need something that's really going to stimulate me.
I looked at this and I was like, yeah, I can see why a subset of people I follow on Twitter are kind of into this, but I choose not to participate. You bought this, didn't you?
I got it for my birthday. I really like this. I don't think I've played enough of it.
I haven't got the right mindset or patience to really dig into it in the way that I think you need to be able to beat it and really get your head around it. But I really enjoyed the cheerleading of this by like three people. I'm there the reason I put it on my birthday list and I have had a good time with it.
But I don't know if I missed the boat in terms of that initial wave of excitement of everyone playing together and like saving each other. When you die, you can kind of put out a sort of beacon and then other people can come and take on that dungeon to try and come and save your character so you can come back to life. But I've got like no friends on my Switch.
So it's just like Sheeran corpses everywhere.
That's tough. Well, I was also going to put Sollium Infernam for this. Just something I didn't really.
I saw it and I was like, that looks like it would be cool if I was going to live for 150 years, but I think I'm probably going to live for somewhere between 36 and 70 years. In that remaining 24, 34 year period, I don't think it's going to happen, unfortunately. So some good choices there, Matthew.
I enjoyed that. Most Cursed. What do you got?
Funko Fusion.
That game had a tough time this year and I felt bad for the devs.
I was sort of surprised by the level of… Well, not the level of… Maybe the quality of licenses they got.
It's kind of like Lego, but for Funko. So it's kind of got that Lego license thing. It's a bit like Lego Dimensions in that it mashes together lots of bits of the Funkoverse.
But like, you play a campaign based on Hot Fuzz? That's weird. In a game?
Like a Hot Fuzz licensed game exists inside Funko Fusion? That I think is quite cursed. Playing as a Funko, Simon Pegg.
Biggest existential crisis trigger. I didn't have one for this, Matthew. What do you got?
Well, this is after the episode where Jay told us about how irrelevant our interests are in the grand scheme of things.
Yeah. Since then, I've decided the bubble is no longer worth talking about. I've decided the bubble is for self-hating liberals.
You know, Trump supporters never talk about their bubble, Matthew. It's for people, liberal people, who want to talk themselves out of ever having a relevant take. That's all it's for.
Don't let it worry you, man. It's just…
Okay.
Yeah.
I like that after the episode that we talked about that, someone looked up to see if more than one person was playing Jedi Outcast and I think like fifteen were or something. So that was nice.
I will confess to looking up how many people were playing Supreme Commander and I think it was over a hundred. There was actually like a… Yeah, it was quite persistent.
I guess they don't really make RTS games these days, so that makes sense.
Maybe we should ask all our listeners to all get on one game at one time and like push it back up into relevance. Every year we should nominate one game to sort of be going to save.
Yeah, I guess my existential crisis would probably be after episode 200 where I'm like, how do I top this for 300? That was… Just thinking about that feels insurmountable because I had the idea for episode 200 as soon as we finish episode 100 and I don't have one for 300 yet, so it's a bit more like, I don't know what the fuck that's going to be, so that's not ideal.
My existential crisis was recording episode 200 and you saying repeatedly, that's too readily while I was reading. Going, what does that mean?
But it was too readily, I was right. When you listened back to the takes, was I not?
Yeah, we were… I know, but it was just… I was like, oh no, I'm not going to be able to do this.
Oh god, I'm wicking out, I've got to like, I've got to kind of pull myself together.
The funniest and most cursed thing I think I did this year was when I listened back to that edit that you did for Episode 200, which really made it, it was an amazing edit. It was your line at the very end, I just started repeating to myself as you said it, well I was just saying it was difficult to get it down to 100 for the Hideo Kojima corny tweet joke and I just, that was a cursed thing that happened to me this year. So yeah, good.
Best Bolatro card Matthew, Bolatro.
This sucks, this category. I was just playing Bolatro, I thought that would be funny. I like Supernova.
What's that one?
Supernova, it just adds the number of times the current hand has been played to the multiplier.
Oh yeah, that's a good, simple, always good.
So I think it's retroactive, so if you've played 50, or not 50, 15 duos, it comes preloaded with like 15, because you've already been doing that. I don't know if the Bolatro Jokers have necessarily the kind of, they've seeped out culturally enough for this award to work in anyway.
It's a real heads no kind of situation, I think. I think Egg is a great one, the little egg that's got the Joker face on it, that's really good.
Yeah, it was sort of more about the design. I like that one with the baseball player, whatever that is.
Well, I know, you got to pick the jokey ones too. I want to pick a business card with Joseph J. Joker on it.
I want that card made in real life and I want to go to PR events and give that out as my business card with no other information on it. I just think that would be a great bit for about two months at most. At least one Gamescom.
I mean, I'm sure Bellatria will still be big next August, right? I mean, I'm taking a risk here, but...
Oh, I think so.
Yeah, I think a lot of those Joker cards are beautifully done. So, okay, good. Next up, then, Matthew.
I've thought of a new Recipe Award for Best Virtual Food. What have you got?
Biscotti and croissants and Indiana Jones. Again, it's Indiana Jones, but they're fucking amazing.
I put biscotti as well. Like, it's such good biscotti, man. You got to, like, ray trace biscotti.
It's pretty good.
It's just so funny that every level has, like, its own food ecosystem, like, food specific to the region. It's really funny that in a fight, Indiana Jones is eating, like, whole star fruits and bananas to regain stamina. It's good shit, that.
It's suitably dumb.
Yeah, okay, good stuff. Yeah, the only other one I'm going to put is, I really like the bottles of health drink in Silent Hill 2 Remake for the simple reason that they look like the little bottles you get at Japanese convenience stores.
Oh.
They really have that kind of design to them. I would say that game's got a lot of, like, good 2D art in it in terms of, like, little bits and pieces you find around the world, like the owl design that's on the rifle bullets you find later in the game. It just speaks.
I can't remember if anything like that is in the original game, but it's a nice touch nonetheless, so I like that one. We'll take a break, then, Matthew, for our last of the recommendations from this year's guests.
It's me, it's Alex Wiltshaw. Game that really appeared to me just in the last few days as being my game of the year and normally I wouldn't be so rushed to come to this conclusion. But Indiana Jones, what a game.
The world is beautiful. There's lots of things to look at. The things, the relics, the things on the floor, the things in your hand.
All the things, great big interconnected levels, tight, you can't wander very far, but within that tightness, so many little passageways and ways to get from here to there. Things hidden, which is important to a game like Indiana Jones. Things to discover, lovely.
Amazing voice acting, cutscenes you actually want to watch. Can't remember many games that really make me feel, oh, what if this is the last level? I'm only on the second area now.
And I'm thinking, well, if there's only one more level after this, I'll be so sad. I mean, I've got my money's worth, my Game Pass money's worth, because I've spent so long in the Vatican. I was playing Jedi Survivor earlier this year, and I just went on and on and on.
I couldn't wait till the end. I just wanted closure. This one, I wanted to go on forever right now.
Great Christmas game. It's the end of my Game of the Year. Well, thanks boys.
Welcome back. Thanks to our guests for all their contributions, for once again being associated with this podcast. It's nice to not be seen as a source of great shame, by the people who have come on before.
Least satisfying side content Matthew, I don't have one for this.
Marion Luigi Brothership. The side quests are absolutely miserable in that game, because it sends you back to very tiny levels, which were only designed to be explored once, but you have to explore them like four or five times each, and on each subsequent return you are just so, so done with that shit. Marion Luigi Brothership.
I think I over-review, I think I over-scored it a little bit in a review.
Oh no. Well, you know.
Yeah, if you don't review I keep thinking like, ah, I don't know. It ends strong, but then, because it ends strong, it makes me sort of forget about all the sort of miserable bits that I didn't enjoy along the way.
That's like my four-star review of Long Legs on Letterboxd. It keeps eating away at me. I know it's not a four-star film, but I got very immersed in like the Long Legs experience this year, and I think that's what the extra star was for that.
But that's like a three-star film, I think, at most.
That's tough, but you've got to live with these scores.
Yeah, indeed. Yeah, I would actually like probably chuck in... I would say that the summons in FF7 Rebirth are so onerous.
You have to fight them in order to beat them, but then you have to fully level them up, go to these stones and do a little rhythm action puzzle thing. I think that just feels like a waste of time. Just give me fucking Odin.
It would not be improved in the original FF7 game if they added all those steps. They just gave you the summon material and it felt good.
I think the summons are a part they still haven't nailed in either of those games.
No, they're not powerful enough.
The way you get them, the way they behave, I hope they take another swing at them.
I wish they were more like how summons are used in FF13 where they're there basically instead of the party and then they just do loads and loads of fucking rad moves in a row and then disappear. Instead, they just sort of linger and hang around and you don't really feel the weight of them. So yeah, that's not that satisfying.
But generally speaking, I do like FF7 Rebirth, Open World stuff quite a lot actually. I think it's quite nicely laid out. There's not too much of it.
It's all right. So yeah. Okay.
Worst discourse, Matthew.
Anything involving Sweet Baby.
Oh, I mean, that's the actual winner, of course. Yeah.
So grim. This year has just felt like super ugly and depressing, and you can only block and mute so much, it still somehow gets into your feeds. Though I am actually finding the last few months of Blue Sky a bit more chill, a bit nicer.
Yeah.
I think that gradually they're trying to migrate all of the right wing scumbags onto Blue Sky, but there's also a lot of block lists you can add to just get rid of a lot of the people. So I agree, it's a bit more like old Twitter in some ways.
Yeah. I feel like I care. I'm trying to make new content.
Yeah.
That's the real winner, I think. I think some of the discussion around Stellar Blade, but the non-serious one is, why isn't Dragon Age Veilguard like old Dragon Age origins? I hated that this year.
In general, I think Veilguard really got a kicking before people even played it, and that was kind of depressing to see. You can give it a kicking when you've actually played it, if you feel that way, but I think I would say some corners of the internet did not want to give that game a chance.
That is true.
Anything else, Matthew?
No, I'm just chuckling at the next category, so directly after this one.
Oh, God, yeah. The If I Was a Thirsty Overly Online Person, This Is the Character I Would Thirst For Award. What have you got, Matthew?
Well, I decided not to pick anyone for FF7 Rebirth, as that always seems to create an upset.
Too obvious.
Too obvious. There's a party member in Infinite Wealth called Chitose. She's sort of like the brains of the outfit, which is what I like.
You know, you've got these sort of like dumbass middle-aged guys who are sort of fucking up constantly, and she's just quite well put together. Yeah, she's just a good character, a good hang.
Yeah, I just googled her in the background. I see the appeal, Matthew.
She has a really good karaoke song in it as well.
Yeah, okay, that's fair.
This category can't help but look a bit shabby.
There's no good way out of it, is there?
Here's a woman, I guess.
Yeah. Fuck it, I picked Scarlett from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, okay? I'll be accepting no further questions at this time.
Next category. Game from this year that will make a great TV show or film. What have you got, Matthew?
Rise of the Golden Idol.
Oh, okay, interesting.
What I like about it is I think the potato-faced characters of the Golden Idol verse, the slightly kind of weirdo looking things, I just think this could be a stellar like character actor piece. And I like the idea of kind of like an anthology show that you can kind of jump through different points in history. Kind of, I guess, like a true detective, but with like a bigger historical sweep.
So you go back three centuries in one season, and then you do one set in the 70s and one in the 90s. I think it would be cool. Weirdly, when I listened to the Bolatro orchestral music at the Game Awards, I was very tired when I listened to it.
My brain went to a slightly weird place, and for some reason, the words Hotel Bolatro popped into my head. And then I had a certain image of a TV show about loads of people who gather in this casino to play Bolatro. And I was like, that would be fucking great on TV with this music.
I have a very serious question for you. Has Bolatro ruined your life in the last three weeks, Matthew?
Not really. It's been like a constant sort of hum in the background. It's like that Rebecca Hall drama on the BBC, The Listeners.
It's just there, always. I'm like, does anyone else get in that?
Yeah, I actually did something quite severe with Bolatro. I actually banned myself from playing it, other than when I was on the train to and from London. There's no other time I allow myself to play it.
In order to just maintain some healthy boundaries with it, that's the thing that happened. But, Hotel Bolatro?
Yeah, I don't know what that is. But the word Hotel Bolatro sort of stuck with me.
Is that... That feels like an Eagles cover waiting to happen. Welcome to the Hotel Bolatro.
Just a very dreamy kind of show. And I could see it working. I could see people being like, they're turning Bolatro into a TV show.
What the fuck's that going to be? And the challenge of trying to pull that off.
I don't know, that's what I've been thinking about for a long time.
What are you talking about?
Harlan Coban's Hotel Bolatro on Netflix, I just...
Only for the last couple of days, obviously, but it keeps coming back to me, Hotel Bolatro.
Well we know some guys who work at Playstack, so I'm sure you can solicit the TV and film rights from them Matthew and make that happen.
I think it would be great. The music's already there.
Oh dear. Okay, that was deranged. I've got Still Wakes the Deep.
Oh, that is good.
Perfect. It's got everything you need for a horror movie. It's set on a Scottish oil rig.
It's got great monsters in it. It's got really substantial characters in it and a main character with a complicated background and some really decent side characters. That's got everything it needs for a film, I think, and a good, memorable horror film as well.
Yeah, 18 though for language. Oh boy.
I thought you said languid then. I keep hearing languid everywhere, Matthew.
No, language. It's far from languid.
Yeah, plus in America, they need it with subtitles, so that wouldn't be ideal. Okay. Non-gaming media from this year that would make a great game, Matthew.
What have you got?
Conclave.
Oh yeah, that's a good one. Yeah.
Loads of priests locked in the Vatican, the Vatican again. Your aim, become Pope. It's an immersive sim.
Do you use your speech skill to charm a belligerent nun? Do you amass guilt by breaking into the dead Pope's bedroom? You better get out to confession before you're sending me to max us out.
That's what I wrote.
Well, I feel like someone will eventually mod this into Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. That's got to be on the cards at some point.
Just like an Easter egg. I just want to see, like, Ray Fiennes looking out of a window, looking just very sort of perplexed.
Conclave is going to feel so out of the culture in about 18 months. So I feel like that's got a short shelf life, but I do like the idea of it. I prefer it to Hotel Bellatro, I'll be honest.
I'll pack out Hotel Bellatro and we'll see if I can talk you around.
David Morrissey will be in that. I just know that's going to happen.
Welcome to Hotel Bellatro. I can't do David Morrissey.
That was just your Paul McCartney again doing Home for the Future. Welcome to the Hotel Bellatro. Okay, enough of that.
Enough silly voices. I got scavengers reign for this one, Matthew. Welcome to the Mobius fuck planet.
There's just lots of horrible wildlife that's after you, and you just got a survival game. But with that art style, I think that would go down really well. I think you could do that art style quite well in a video game.
Yeah. Also, X-Men 97 I put down as well. I feel like you could revisit the 90s X-Men aesthetic in video game form, probably to some success and very much enjoy.
Yeah, for sure.
Yeah. Even has an episode set inside a video game. So, you know, the crossover feels there.
But that is the end of the awards, Matthew. It's done. What a great way to finish.
So shall we take a quick break and then come back with some other gubbins?
Yes, let's.
Welcome back to the podcast. Matthew's got a treat for me here. So curious to see where this goes, Matthew.
What have you prepped for this bit?
Last time we did the Christmas Grab Bag episode, we did our rundown of top Christmas games. We did that the year before. So I thought we could do a little look back at the year, but through some of the more scathing reviews of the year.
So I'm going to challenge you to identify games from one-star Amazon reviews.
Oh, interesting, because I guess they have to be physical games.
Yeah, and I would say they are all games which are generally loved.
Oh, okay, okay, exciting.
This is the people who don't like loved games. I'm going to say up front, I thought this would be funnier when I came up with the idea. So well, let's just wait and see.
Okay, well, okay, with that caveat in mind, let's kick off.
You got 10 reviews here. Review number one. What was expected to be a great game is ruined by Crumble Rumble 3.
If you think lost symbols are incredibly messed up infuriating, then wait till you start Crumble Rumble 3. You will lose your soul during three attempts. An hour later, you'll be ready to throw your TV out the window.
It's such a shame.
Is this Astro Bot?
It is!
I thought Crumble Rumble sounds like the kind of slightly unimaginative level titles that they have in that game. So yeah.
There you go. That's one-tenth of the quiz.
There was a time when I was doing those bonus levels that I might have given this game one star on Amazon. So I understand without judgement.
I just like that I was going through them on Amazon. There were only like six one-star reviews and just the word Crumble Rumble really made me laugh.
None of these better be the packaging arrived, fucked up or whatever. You see that quite a lot.
I was tempted to throw one of those in. I was quite limited in people who had actually written, you know, they'd engaged somewhat with the game. I purchased this version as it promised all the DLC, and I know I want all the DLC.
Turns out the DLC is some bangles, because that's what you're thinking during this game. I wish it had more bangles. Do not get this edition unless you really love bangles.
Is this a metaphor?
No. But it's sort of along the right lines.
Oh, it's not Dragon Age The Veil Guide, is it? Nope.
I'll give you one more guess.
Bangles. Oh, Persona 3 Reload?
No, it's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
Oh, okay. Bangles. All right.
That's fair enough.
Someone was upset they didn't get bangles, or they did get bangles, whatever.
All right. Well, next up then.
This game is just not fun. Inventory management is a bear and dominates the early game. So much pointless running around.
Combat is fine, but simple, which at my age is a bit of an advantage. Adaptive difficulty is a mystery. Story is confusing.
Figuring out where to go can be extremely difficult. Crafting seems more or less pointless. Gear scores are confusing, so it's hard to tell if the added weight is really worth it.
Crafting? What game am I crafting this year? This isn't Echoes of Wisdom, is it?
No. I got hung up on the inventory management thing at the start there.
No, but I would say this game, they are quite right in saying inventory management is a bit of a pain during the early game.
Oh.
Until you've kind of got your head around it. I think that kind of...
I don't know this one. Sorry. I feel like I'm gonna let you down here.
You have played it and enjoyed it. Oh. Uh.
Game where weight is a problem a lot of the time.
Weight is a problem. So you're carrying too much and you've got to keep changing. Oh God.
I don't know. Sorry, Matthew.
That's Dragon Stogma 2.
Oh, that's a good call actually. Yeah. Yeah.
That's all very true. Um, yes. Yeah.
One star is harsh though.
Again, these are not my reviews. I do not endorse these opinions. I'm having a hard time playing this game.
It is nothing like the original game. I'm already an hour and a half into the game and half the stories are about a lesbian love affair. It's incredibly annoying.
I just want to have fun and kill zombies and beat the game.
Lesbian love affair? Zombies? What fucking game is that?
And a remake. I mean, it's not Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door, is it?
No.
Made myself laugh there. It's not Epic Mickey Rebrush.
Lesbian love affair? Between who? There's only one lady, isn't there?
It's Minnie.
I made myself laugh there. Sorry. Cackling at my own stupid fucking joke.
Lesbian love affair and it's a remake.
Imagine this review is a real dirtbag.
This isn't Silent Hill 2, is it?
It isn't. It's The Last of Us Part II Remastered.
Oh right. I mean, what did they think the original game was about? Fucking moron.
I mean, that's…
what?
Idiot. I'm going to go find that review and give him like a this was not helpful response. Oh dear, okay.
What an idiot. Okay, next up.
If you are an old age pensioner whose reflexes are not what they used to be, you will find it very hard to finish the boss battles. What with the input lag of the game, you are on a hiding to nothing. The on-screen visual hints flash so quick that you cannot read them quickly enough, and when you do read them, it's too late.
I'm playing on story mode and the game gets very boring if all you're doing is respawning. Take me word for it, that's all I'm doing.
Is this Dragon Age Veilguard?
It isn't. It's something we've discussed. Not a game I would think an old person would be playing.
Oh, okay. Is this FF7 Rebirth?
No.
God, I'm so bad at this.
A lot of visual clues in the battle, lots of visual different things you have to respond to.
Oh, is this, is this Stellar Blade?
It is.
Oh, okay, good. Finally got there. That's good.
Finally got one. Yes. It's been a while.
That's it? That is weird. But you know, I wonder why an older bloke would play this game, Matthew.
I wonder what would draw such a gentleman to this experience. It's a real question mark, isn't it? What a mystery.
My grandad's a creep.
That's from HornyGrandpa69.
If wandering about with no purpose or objective is your thing, then this is the game for you. 90% of the buildings are inaccessible, so you just smash windows with no purpose. No auto-save, so if one of the BDSM zombies gets you, and there's no way not to get hit if you are tackling one, you'll be back where you were 15 minutes earlier.
Save your money and buy either of the Last of Us games.
What an absolute fucking loser playing Silent Hill 2 Remake. You've got no business playing this game, sir. You simply lack the talent.
I haven't died once playing this game on its normal difficulties. So, yeah. Also, smashing windows is really fun in this, but I do agree there is a little bit of an arbitrary thing of like, Bloober Team went to the trouble of designing this glass shattering system, so you better do it 9,000 times.
That feels like a real thing in the game, so yeah.
I'm really sad about my wife, but not so sad that I can't stop to elbow in 5 windows of this car. Smash, smash, smash.
With the remote possibility of finding one bottle of medicine in there. Yes.
Not an action adventure as described. It is a stealth game. 90% of a mission involves standing behind a box.
There is no action alternative. Two or three shots and you're dead. Get caught in a stealth mission and it's game over.
It looks great, but not a lot else. If your idea of an action adventure is God of War or Final Fantasy 7, then this isn't for you. If you enjoy crawling through vents and hiding behind boxes, then go for it.
Is it Star Wars Outlaws?
It is.
Yeah, I can sort of... The stealth was oddly contentious in this game. I sort of liked the commitment to it and I didn't think it was that complicated, but I could see why it being forced might be controversial.
But I also think that's a little bit of a fickle players' thing of I thought that people complained Ubisoft games were too simple or they played themselves or whatever. So I found that criticism a bit irritating this year, Matthew. Yeah.
Okay, good.
You got three more to go.
I'm enjoying this. It's good. It's a good segment.
Go on.
Yeah. Nobody said how much this sucked, so I will. Incredibly repetitive and boring with very linear maps.
Definitely not open world style. You just head from one objective to the next taking on waves of annoying aliens, which in reality you wouldn't last more than a few seconds against. The sheer numbers gets a bit silly, to be honest.
Oh, this isn't like an EDF game, is it?
No.
Oh, that would be really funny if someone was like, there's too many aliens in this game. Well, it's not Helldivers, I imagine, because Helldivers is not… Yeah, that's a guess.
That's a guess. It's not, is it?
It isn't. But I'd say there's one more Lots of Aliens game remaining.
Lots of Aliens?
Well, I think they're aliens. I don't really know this universe.
Oh, universe. So I don't know this one. I can't look it out.
You like it. You've talked about it in the last hour.
Fuck's sake, really? Let me scroll through my fucking notes, see if I can remember.
I'd say what's noticeable about this game is loads of alien enemies.
Why can't I work this out? Oh, Space Marine 2.
Yes.
Okay, there we go. Got there in the end after scrolling through my notes. Wow, yeah, what a fucking idiot, really.
I mean, what can you say? Sometimes the customer is wrong, you know?
Yeah.
Okay, what's next?
Whilst the environments and gameplay is pretty good with regards to the horror bits, after the finishing game, I was like, huh, the game offers no replayability and took me four and a half hours to complete. Even at £22.99, I ended up trading it in for £17, as I will likely never play this game again. I do think Game Pass is the ideal graveyard for this game, so play on there instead.
Christ, that's a very damning assessment of Still Wakes the Deep.
It is.
That is harsh.
That is a…
That's a slight ideal graveyard. I don't know why that made me laugh.
Yeah, I don't really get buying this physically and then trading it in. It's a strange game to buy physically, I think. It's sort of like…
I don't get that. But hey-ho. Alright, next up, Matthew.
This last one's quite hard, I will say. Well, yeah, I don't think you've… No, you haven't played it, I will say.
Alright. But we'll see. Bought a horse from a horse dealer.
Then my figure vanishes into thin air. Then I get on the horse and I ride it invisibly. Really now?
Oh yes, a horse is half in the stable, it wobbles back and forth like in a disco. I have no words. Even at the easiest level of difficulty, you have to parry and strike precisely in order to survive.
I, at 75 years, belong to the first generation of gamers. After more than 30 years as a craftsman, my finger joints are closed and the ability to react goes down the drain. It would be nice if the game developers would consider that our children are adults.
We have more money left over for hobbies than the boys.
Powerful boomer energy. Is that Rise of the Ronin?
It is!
Amazing! Got it first time. Look at that.
Yeah, got that and not some of the way more obvious ones, which is quite funny.
You got that from a horse and a parry. Fantastic.
Yeah, I just thought, and also the fact that it was slightly busted, I thought that's got a little bit of a whiff of Rise of the Ronin about it.
I just liked it describing this horse wobbling back and forth as a disco, being so incensed by it that you had to write about it on Amazon.
Yeah. I want to play this game now. You've sort of like whet my appetite for it.
I'm waiting for it to be like 23 quid in a sale, then I might get it.
Yeah, I'm sure it will be on PS Plus at some point.
Yeah, it will come to PC at some point or something.
Well, that's it. That's the quiz. You got 7 out of 10.
That's all right. 7 out of 10, the best number, some might argue.
Did you enjoy that? Was that worthwhile?
I thought it was good. We've really transitioned into being like Quizmen in recent times. I don't really know why we've done this, but I think it's a nice break from the usual stuff we do, isn't it?
So yeah.
Anyway, there's one more segment to come.
There is. Shall we take a quick break Matthew and come back with that?
Let's do it.
Welcome back to the final section of this podcast. By the time you've finished listening to it, it will be next Christmas. What can I say?
No, it's good. We wanted to end with some listener Xmas Memories, Matthew. So shall we take it in turns to read these out?
That seems like it makes sense.
Yes, thank you for everyone who submitted them. I feel like lots of people told us their juiciest anecdotes last year, but I liked it as a tradition.
Some of these have big, some stuff happened energy to them, I would say. But that's okay, because it's nice to have for people to share. I'll read this first one, Matthew.
Many years ago, I got an Xbox 360 and cracked down, and as a Christmas treat, I could set it up on the big TV in the living room. All was well until my mum started watching. She got upset at me, blowing people up and taking delight in throwing their ragdolls off buildings, and the 360 was relegated to my room shortly after.
Merry Christmas. That's from Evil Dr. Pigs in Blankets. Any thoughts on that?
They've all given themselves silly Christmas names on Discord, so a lot of these are old favourites, kind of remixed for the festive period.
The fonts weren't quite showing up properly for the things I copied and pasted for these questions. So I went to open another tab to open the original version you sent over for these questions, Matthew, and I just found lots of pictures of fucking Chitose from Like A Dragon Infinite. Well, that's cursed, that's a cursed thing that happened this year to me.
Okay, do you want to read this next one?
The Christmas when it came out, me and my whole family had a fishing competition in Ocarina of Time for hours. Probably one of the only times my mum has ever played a video game. That's from Trip Hazard, which I thought was a nice little story, but it just made me want to ask you, have you ever pulled your family into an unexpected multiplayer session, Samuel?
No, my parents, I mean, my mum just despises video games. She doesn't even remotely engage with them. She's not like-
Even to humor you just once.
When I sent her a picture of Indie on the BBC News homepage, she was genuinely very supportive and impressed by that. That was nice. But it's not like she's ever, since I gave them the first two issues of play I worked on, and they just put them on a living room coffee table, they've never really looked at the stuff or wanted to play games.
My dad only plays games by himself. So this has never happened, but this year my brother really wants to, he's bought that Star Wars Battlefront Classics collection, and he really wants us to do split screen, Empire vs Rebels and that.
What, with your mum and your dad?
No, not with them.
I was going to say, that's a difficult game for your first game.
We have done, we used to do Mario Kart DS multiplayer, me and my dad and my brother, actually. That's the thing we did at least a couple of Christmases with that absolutely insane, your online Nintendo beep thing that was going on in that multiplayer, whatever that was. That was strange, but yeah, that was very enjoyable.
That's what comes to mind, Matthew. What about you?
So I've got lots of brothers and sisters. I have enough siblings to kind of put together four player multiplayer, quite comfortably without dragging parents into it. My dad would play with us when we were kids, would play like micro machines and things like that with us.
So I guess that counts. These days, it probably means like there will be an old school, probably like a Super Mario Kart on the SNES game at Catherine's house with her brothers. And I am fucking shit at that game.
That's always quite hard work losing to everyone. But that's fine. It's the spirit of the thing.
I mean, SNES Mario Kart is ass these days. That's a take I'm comfortable having. It's not that's not a good time for anyone.
Is it? Do you disagree with that?
I think there's some people who've just played it. Like, it's never left their circulation for them.
Yeah, right.
So they could. But like, if you have been playing later Mario Kart, it is quite hard going back to it. Look, it's a very different skill set it taps into.
Yeah. And I am shit at it. So, you know, just on a sort of throwing my toys up a pram level, it's kind of a tough hang.
I would say we're the top five most disappointing SNES games to revisit at Mario Kart. I think it's just like, no. It's a hard no.
Any other later version I would prefer to play than that one. I do agree. It requires a slightly different skill set.
We've got another bit from Trip Hazard here too, right Matthew?
He says, another Christmas, I really wanted Super Mario World. We went into Game or Electronics Boutique, whatever it was at the time, and I showed it to my mum and the gran. I want this one in this box.
Don't get any other one. It's this one. They didn't buy it there, but then they said we'd come back to it later, which worried me.
What if they sold out? What if they got too late and the shop closed? I voiced these concerns loudly and at length as we went around to buy gifts for other people, and sulked a lot as well.
I was a right little shit. After about three hours of this, my mum had had enough and shouted at me, We already got the game! I distracted you and gran brought it!
We were going to surprise you! I felt relieved. The game was secure.
Nicest pie for the rest of the day. Which I can absolutely sympathise with, but also it's like sad to ruin a surprise, isn't it?
Yeah, I've done it once. This is like some, whatever bullshit year, seven exams I had to do. My parents bought me the Phantom Menace on VHS as a reward.
That may not sound like a reward to some people, but to me in 1999, I can assure you it very much was. And I was just tall enough, because I was starting to be taller than my parents, I could see it on top of the cabinet, where they had hidden it very poorly. And my mum was so angry that I saw it and busted it.
I would say that's on her for not hiding it very well.
She's not tall enough to hide it better.
Well that's true, but she could have put it in her room, in some kind of underwear drawer, somewhere that I would never look. So instead it was just in our living room at all times, that I could see a bit of gold on the edge of a VHS case. What else is it going to be?
It's not my fault you don't understand sight lines.
Okay, next up. My first Christmas, moving back to Sunderland, I wanted some obscure PS1 game called Blazing Dragons, which is probably impossible to find. My mam made the call to instead go for FF7, Final Fantasy 7, a woman of clear good taste, changing my gaming trajectory for life, brackets and for the better.
That's from SAFC Jack 91. Well that's nice isn't it? That's like the opposite of Marge Simpson buying Lee Carvalho's putting challenge.
You got to read this very long one Matthew.
Yeah, I've got a long one, so someone sent this to me on Twitter. Thank you very much. It's from Pavel.
I grew up in 90s Poland and just after the fall of the Berlin Wall there was a boom on everything Western. This naturally included video games and thanks to my older brother we soon had access to a Famicom clone, an Amiga 500 and later on a PlayStation. I was hooked.
Absolutely loved the gray, as we called Sony's console in Poland, despite my mum and uncle who were the closest relatives, not really getting the appeal and often treating my hobby with open disdain. For them it was a waste of time and an expensive one at that, since original PlayStation games were very costly considering the post-Soviet wages. Needless to say I would seldom be gifted any games and had to rely on what I already owned, a limited library including the brilliant Alundra, demo discs and whatever I could borrow from my friends.
I started to have my suspicions that something was on just before Christmas 1989 when my uncle started asking me questions about video games. Questions like does it matter if a game case is damaged? And do you like spaceships?
And so for Christmas 1999 my uncle got me a now forgotten pre-owned PlayStation game in a broken case called Invasion. A very mediocre 3D space shooter that I nevertheless immediately popped into the console and started playing excitedly. My uncle watched me from the chair throughout and I sneaked a big grin on his face.
He was clearly happy that I was happy, despite what must have been a very costly endeavour for him. Your post about Christmas gifts took me back and made me think of my uncle who has sadly recently passed away, and how fondly I still remember a not that great game just because in that moment it was special. It also made me think how spoiled we are now as gamers, demanding only 9 out of 10 and perhaps forgetting how special the 6 and 7 out of 10s can be.
So Merry Christmas to you, Sam and your close ones and thank you for the podcast. Again, from Pavel. What a nice email.
That is nice. That reminds me of my mum in Christmas 2001, saying, my students keep talking about this game called SSX Tricky, which they definitely didn't, but she was trying to like... And that's how I ended up with 007 Agent Under Fire.
So that's good, which was a very mediocre game.
What did you say? No, not SS Tricky.
I think I said, oh yeah, that did sound pretty cool. But for whatever reason, I reckon my dad went, oh, GoldenEye was good, so we'll get him this. I mean, that is 100 percent how most people ended up with mediocre Bond games on PS2.
It's because dads across the country thought that. They're like, oh, he likes that Bond one, and then it's a totally different Bond one by a different developer, and it's like not good. Nightfire was all right, but Agent Under Fire was not very good.
So yeah, that's a nice story. I like that. Limited library, but exciting.
Yeah, I can see how in that specific situation it will be good. I also like the gray thing. Like that is a bit of world building.
It's very good.
I just like, do you like spaceships?
Really simple one here from Martin. Ask for Simpsons hit and run on PS2 and a double T for D box set of the two Mission Impossible films. Well, one out of two isn't bad, is it?
Got Mission Impossible Operation Surmer on PS2. Parents can't be trusted with simple instructions. That's funny.
That game, do they get like fives and sixes that game? I can't remember.
Yeah, I don't even know what the deal is. Like, is it Tom Cruise? I don't think it's Tom Cruise.
It's definitely not. It's in the Minority Report PS2 game thing of like, we couldn't get Tom Cruise basically. So here's his off-brand Aldi equivalent.
What is Surmer? Is that a place? Surmer?
Yeah, I don't know. I was thinking of Burma. It's literally not the same.
Okay. Do you want to read this next one, Matthew?
As a youngster, I was given a game at Christmas, which I still consider to be one of the greatest PC games of all time, Age of Empires 2. It's the perfect gift. However, at the time of opening, my family had to make a four-hour trip to spend Christmas with my aunt and uncle.
So I spent several days pouring over the instruction booklet instead of actually playing it. To be fair, instruction booklets were really good back then. That's from Ding Dong Emily on i.
That's a great name. Well done.
A great name. But I wanted to ask, had you ever suffered a painful delay once you had a game?
Okay, so I had this Star Wars Christmas in 1998, I think it was. This was like the peak of my Star Wars mania. And my parents and my grandparents, everything I got was Star Wars related basically.
I got like micro machines, like these little Kenner figures. And I got the VHS box set, the gold one with the movies and the extra bits that George Lucas added that no one liked. And all that business basically.
Got that. And then as part of that, when I was in Mansfield where all this happened, which is where my family is from, I got given Rogue Squadron on CD-ROM and Shadows of the Empire on CD-ROM. And I looked at those so excited for it, but it was at least like, I think it was like a week and a half away before I'd play them.
So I definitely remember looking at those boxes over and over again, because I just could not wait to experience those on our home PC.
Yeah, that's tough. I had this all the time with just PC games breaking, or like not being able to get PC games working in the 90s, or getting Discworld 2, and then having to wait until... We had a friend of the family called Richard who knew about PCs, and basically I couldn't play it until Richard came around.
You know, Richard couldn't come around on his Christmas. So that was a nightmare. No sound, trying to get whatever the fuck sound blaster was to work.
That was always tough. Really bad one was the year I got my PlayStation 3 with Uncharted 2, but because that it doesn't come with a HDMI cable, the PS3, because consoles didn't in that generation because they fucking sucked. I couldn't actually plug it into any TV at like a decent resolution and watch it.
So it was a case of having like, I had this thing and I couldn't do it. So I had to go in and like buy, I knew it was only Boxing Day, but still like, I can't, that was my last new console Christmas I think. And not being able to play it there and then was just, that was a heartbreaker.
Going to a Maplin in the late noughties and buying an overpriced HDMI cable was a cursed ritual we all had to do at some point because Sony just would not spend the extra like, one quid to bundle it in with a PS3.
This one's twice as good because it's plated with gold and you're like, that is literally a lie. That is a lie. There is no difference.
Oh dear, that's so funny. Yeah, a couple of cursed trips to that Bournemouth Maplin in my memory. That's a good one Matthew, I like that.
So did you play Uncharted 2 with shit RGB or did you just wait?
I wanted to respect it and not play until I could.
Respect the sanity of Naughty Dog. That's good behavior. Okay, next one then.
This is from Jaloloosum. So I received Kingdom Hearts for Christmas the year it came out. I think that was 2002 in the UK.
Was super excited to get it as my brother and I had been looking into it a lot. As I opened the game, queued my brother saying, but I wanted that game for Christmas and temper tantrum for the next few hours. Apparently, I ruined his Christmas by receiving it and wasn't even happy that I let him play it on my PS2 that I had bought with my own money.
Your brother sounds like a scumbag, mate. That's my take on this. Funny, because my brother's absorbed quite a lot of my game tastes and he was way younger than me and he was like, I guess I would have been 13, no, 14 when Kingdom Hearts came out and he would have been like four or five watching me play this.
That became one of the defining series for him as you might expect, but being close at age sibling wise, I could see this being a problem. So yes. Want to read this next one, Matthew?
I grew up in a working class family, so didn't have much money for luxuries. 1997, woke up on Christmas morning. I was nine, so still had that sense of Xmas magic.
To only a few gifts, a couple of books, a film on VHS, a selection box. Remember feeling a bit disappointed, but knew we were skinned, so I didn't want to appear ungrateful. One hour later, my mum comes in with another gift, a surprise from Santa.
You guessed it, it was an N64 with Super Mario 64, and it was so joyous and unexpected, and what a leap from the Sega Mega Drive. Best Christmas ever, and have fond memories of playing that all Christmas break. That's from Christmas Steve, the aptly named Christmas Steve.
That's nice.
I imagine that. That's some fucking hell.
Charlie Bucket-ass narrative that is.
Oh, I love a bit of theatre on Christmas Day. That's everything. But wait.
I like parents who see the idea of a good present with an earlier present. But why have I got this? I couldn't possibly play it.
Well, we'll have to wait and see. Maybe if you're lucky on your birthday.
Here's a question. Do you think people just have children so they can do that one thing? Is that the only reason some people have kids?
I was going to say, it's pretty high on the list. As I read these, I think, I'd quite like to have a kid just so I can fuck with them in that good way on Christmas Day.
Yeah, you can't quite do it with a cat or a dog, can you? They don't really conceptually understand why one package has something in it and the other one doesn't.
Not for a long time, but I've done birthday treasure hunts for Katherine around the house. We haven't got a huge amount of real estate to deal with, so it's not like a globe-trotting adventure or anything. This one's in the bookcase in the dining room, this one's in the cupboard in the kitchen.
But I feel like I've got that sense of drama in me.
That's actually triggered a memory of another Christmas I ruined, actually. I can't remember if I previously talked about this, but my mom wanted to set up a treasure hunt for us, and it was so poorly conceived because it was so obvious.
Did she put it on that short ass cupboard again?
But it was like that because there were gifts hidden around the place. But in one of the cupboard under the stairs, which was opened a lot because it had food in it and stuff, I could obviously see a giant box that was wrapped up, that would later turn out to be an original Xbox. My mom was annoyed that I'd uncovered these, because I'd gotten up quite early and I'd seen where the gifts were.
She was annoyed that I'd done this. Part of the challenge was going to be that she'd dye my hair like bleach blonde or something. It was really like how she lost her marbles for Christmas kind of energy.
I think she's having a tough time at work at the time. That was a proper sent to bed for half the day Christmas for me, even though I was like 15. Anyway, that's how I got my original Xbox.
Sent to bed for half a day at 15?
Yeah. I played the Death of Aerith in FF7 that Christmas.
Oh yeah, and that's when you played the Snowboarding and went a bit mad.
Yeah, that was that Christmas. Just for the people filling out my wiki on the Back Page fandom page there, that's what that Christmas was. 2003.
Anyway, next up then Matthew. At the ripe old age of 8, I was once given a list of games I wanted for Christmas by my mam. She didn't care about age ratings and so one of the options was Gears of War or Dead Space.
As a stupid child, I picked Gears and made it a decent way through, although got terrified of the krill and had to stop playing, hence the nightmares. Any stories of you chaps getting games way too young for Christmas that your parents slash grandparents had no idea of the content? That's from JustKai.
I think Gears of War would be quite cool game to get if you're a kid for Christmas. Certainly more so than Dead Space. That'd be quite intense for a kid to play, but Gears isn't really scary.
It's more like violent, you know?
I like getting like a permanent fear of the krill. They're the bad things, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Oh, no, ah! I was quite good at seeding what I wanted, you know? So I never really got anything by accident.
My grandparents weren't that naive. They would have asked my parents for guidance. So my mom was pretty strict on age rating stuff.
Like she didn't let me have GTA Vice City, which is the story I've told before the podcast. I don't think I could ever really get anything past them. My dad buying GTA 3 was a major transgression in our household.
So yeah, but my dad knew what was in that game. He just didn't care when he got it for you from Argos. So yeah.
Nothing else there Matthew? Should we move on?
No, sorry. Sorry, Jessica.
I'm excited about this next one. Do you want to read it out?
Christmas Present Howler's story from Charlie. Unwrapping a clearly game box shaped gift to find Rock Band Song Pack 1 for the Nintendo Wii. As a child who didn't have Rock Band for Wii, I was thrilled thinking this was going to be a classic case of me going, but parents, I don't have Rock Band for Wii.
How am I to use this song pack for them to respond? Don't worry son, let's just wheel in the game itself and an entire band kit peripheral set which you can then enjoy all those bonus songs. Turns out my optimism was misplaced and I was in a much more realistic scenario where my dad had simply picked up the first game, if you can even call it that, on the shelf and thought, oh yes, this will suit my little dweeby son.
There was no Rock Band game or band kit peripheral coming after all. Fortunately, we went to a local game station a couple of days later for a refund and I put the money towards the Spielberg Classic Boom Blocks. Good times.
Thank you, Charlie. Classic dad fuck up.
Yeah, that's so lazy by that dad. That's like, I mean, I'm buying a bit of DLC in physical game form. That's so cursed.
It's like, I've got you Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart Club band in Beatles Rock Band, but not Beatles Rock Band kind of thing.
That's because the Wii didn't have enough hard drive for you to download the songs.
You know what? You shouldn't have been allowed Rock Band on Wii if that was the case. Do you know what I mean?
That's like, your format is not suitable, sir.
That's the thing, but not that we would have told people that in NGamer. It's like, are you ready to rock in a really compromised manner?
Oh, that's good though. That's really funny. And hey, I ended up with Boom Blocks.
That is a nice ending.
Yeah, that's good.
I want to say this was Christmas 2003, but I had been patiently waiting for months for Dark Chronicle, the PS2 RPG from Level 5. I went down Christmas morning and searched through the presents under the tree for that familiar PS2 sized gift. I was instantly relieved and could enjoy the wait to unwrap it in a state of zen calm.
That morning my mum asked me to add more water to the Christmas tree pot. And I told my sister she had to do it. Didn't give it a second thought.
When it was time to unwrap after lunch, we realised my sister had filled the wrong bit of the pot and water had leaked out into the presents. While I did get Dark Chronicle, my box had absorbed the brunt of the liquid and the cover had gone all knobbly and smeared. Game worked but I feel like I was being punished for being lazy.
That's from Markel. That's got big, what about Little Homer's Sausage Simpsons, the tree melting down energy, you know what I mean? Not quite as bad a fuck up but that's good.
Any thoughts on that one Matthew?
I thought games had plastic shrink wrap.
Yeah, I guess it can kind of leak in. I'd have been disappointed as well because Dark Chronicle, that's like a nice game to own, you know? It's like a...
Yeah, I get that, yeah. Sorry, I don't mean to question the truth of this one.
No, that's absolutely fine Matthew. Do you want to read this next one?
A few years ago I got my friend a VR headset for Christmas, which was actually just a cardboard box I took from work and cut a slot in so he could put it on his head and set his phone where the slot was. I made it up to him by shoving a copy of The Witcher 3 in the slot when he went to try it on. Could have doubled as a podcast recording booth, to be frank.
That's from Wooner Sparrow Hock of Ham.
That's good. Basically just a solid eye for Metal Gear Acid 2 on PSP. That's a thing Konami actually sold with the game.
Isn't that a Nintendo Labo VR as well? Where you just have a switch stuck to your face with a load of cardboard.
What happened to that?
I can see mine on top of the cupboard.
Next to a VHS of The Phantom Menace. When's that going on? The cover of Retro Gamer Labo.
That feels very forgotten as a thing that happened this generation. Okay. I think this is the last one, isn't it?
This one's from Jackieboy34. A tale of joy. Getting a GBA for Christmas 2001.
Wanted this so badly. All my friends had one as their birthdays fell after its release in June. Mine's in April.
My folks had one for months hidden in the shelf next to the family computer I played every day and created a fake advertisement for one so I could buy in the January sales from Ross Records in Portsmouth, a place Samuel might remember, to throw me off the scent I had one. I'm actually so confused by the wording of this. So you got a GBA, right?
Yes, they hid it away but then they made a fake advert for a sale to be like, we'll get you a GBA in the sale after Christmas.
Ah, OK, right, gotcha.
By pointing to an advert, but it was all ruse, he did have one on Christmas Day. That is a lot of effort to go to to throw him off the scent.
Oh, OK, got you. Sorry, Jackie boy. I wasn't paying enough attention there, clearly.
That's fine.
It's 10.30 on a Sunday night.
Did you go to Ross Records in Portsmouth?
I did. Do you know what I bought there? I bought in my birthday on April 2002, when I was 14, I bought a second hand copy of Metal Gear Solid 2, Sons of Liberty, first time I played that, and Headhunter on PS2 as well, a game I really wanted.
So that was like a little stealth-action combo, Big Sammy. I don't really rate Headhunter that much. It was all right for the time, but it was one of those games, I think, that Dreamcast people get overly defensive about, Matthew.
Oh, you mean a Dreamcast game?
Yeah. Ross Records is really cool, actually. It was like, yeah, sort of second-hand, sold video games, DVDs, all that stuff, back when those sorts of places were a bit more, bit funkier, a bit less of the cursed CX vibes.
So definitely still there, actually. Yeah, that's where I got MGS2, so it has a place in my heart. Tale of Woe, the bitter disappointment of Star Wars Episode 1 on PS1 for Xmas 1999.
Love the movie. I was eight, deal with it. I mean, hey, we've already talked about it on this episode.
But the game was garbage. Even an eight-year-old could see that. Still, I do have the Darth Maul CD Wallet to this day, which was objectively a better present.
Yeah, Episode 1, The Phantom Menace, is really bad. Really bad game that really feels like budget and foamed in. I bought it to write about it for Official PlayStation Magazine about 10 years ago, because it was some kind of retrospective feature.
And Matt Pell at the editor asked me, do you want to write about this Star Wars game? I was like, yeah, excuse me to buy this. I can see if it was good or not.
And I knew it wasn't good because I played it at the time. But on PS1, it was particularly jank. It was rough, man.
There was a lot of bad prequel era games, and that was definitely one of them. And that's the end of the podcast, Matthew. We've done it.
That was a big dose of Christmas fun.
It was. I've overindulged on Christmas. Now a stone heavier.
I need to fall asleep in front of the TV. My head tilted forward, drooling while there's a little Christmas hat tipping off while my parents are watching the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special, which is what's going to happen in about 10 days from now, Matthew.
Oh, heavenly. Sounds like a dream.
It does. Yeah, I've already eaten a big tube of Pringles. That's like the first sign of Christmas, really.
So, yeah.
I don't think that's the first day of Christmas in the traditional lyrics.
No, that's like the big...
First day of Christmas, my true love snuffed an entire tube of Pringles.
That's the big Sammy remix. But thank you for your effort in putting this episode together, Matthew. That looks like it took a bit of work, so I appreciate it.
Where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky. I'm mostly on Blue Sky, let's just say that.
I'm on Blue Sky too, Samuel W. Roberts. So don't post on Twitter anymore.
I still get DMs on there. I occasionally post one thing on there, but it's not a big deal. So find me on there.
Podcast is BackPagePod on both Blue Sky and Twitter. We post the same content on both, so take your choice. I've actually tried a little bit harder on Blue Sky recently as well.
I don't know, there's just more people on there, it seems like. More of our listeners have found us on there. What else is there?
Patreon, patreon.com/backpagepod. Do you want an additional podcast right now that's about, what's it about? Oh yeah, that was it, the Eximus Panto.
We recorded it yesterday. It was like we did like an Eximus Panto with video game characters, and we realized it didn't quite have enough meat on the bones to sustain a whole episode. So if you would like to hear our analysis of the Game Awards trailers that were released about a week ago from when you're listening to this, you can go get that right now, patreon.com/backpagepod on the £4.50 Excel tier.
Maybe Christmas is a good time of year to listen. There's also a way you can gift memberships on there, I've realized. So if you are an unfortunate spouse who has to listen to this podcast in the car, and you think that your partner, probably a husband or boyfriend, but not necessarily, could get you, could benefit from such a gift, then I think there's a way to do that on the Patreon page as well.
So that's all the shimmy.
That's amazing.
Yeah, it's good. I think it is like patreon.com/backpagepod/gift. I think it is something like that.
So yeah, that's my attempt there. Matthew, let's get out of here. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
