Jingle bells!
I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello!
Matthew, two pods in two evenings. How are you feeling about it?
Uh, yeah, tired. But two pods in two evenings, but they're going live weeks apart. Yeah.
So, God knows how the world will have changed. Always a risk doing these this early.
Yeah, we're doing this before the Game Awards, right? So if there's any big reveals, there might be some things that, well, GTA would have been revealed by the time this goes live. We haven't got any takes on that, so that's tough.
Let's both guess a take.
Yeah, I really thought that Les Dennis was a bold choice for the main protagonist in GTA VI, but ultimately he has fought hard to establish credibility in the acting space, and so I wish him well.
That is true. I was thrilled that they used Randy Newman's I Love LA for the background music of the first trailer.
Yeah, I was pleased that every trailer was sponsored by DoorDash. That was good. I thought that the use of Robbie Williams' Rude Box in the trailer for the Bloodborne remaster was like a bold one, but ultimately people were fine with it, and that's good.
And I always thought Rude Box was a little bit underrated when it came back in 2006. That Netflix documentary was like, you know, it's obviously raised his profile. I think a Bloodborne, Rude Box, Robbie Williams, it's a great combo, and I wish everyone well with their venture.
So.
Absolutely, and of course, good to see Telltale going from strength to strength, following up the expanse with an adaptation of Saltburn, which I cannot wait to play.
I thought it was controversial to announce From Hell VR and have you play as Jack the Ripper. I wouldn't say that was necessarily a most tasteful decision, but you know, I mean, Alan Moore, I think will be fine with that. So well done, everyone.
Well, we didn't even-
This is a better bit than the bit we've actually got planned for this episode.
Yeah, but we didn't plan this one. So you can hear me struggling with my blood-borne gags. So I was like, oh fuck, I haven't got, I can't improvise more than like one joke.
This is tough. Les Dennis is very low-hanging freak, to be honest. I feel bad about that one already.
And I really do wish him well. Okay, so this episode then-
Unless he's done something awful in the last two weeks.
I'm sure he hasn't, he's fine.
I'm sure he hasn't, but if he has, just so we've got our backs covered, we don't wish that version of him well.
Yeah, brackets we may or may not wish him well, pending future events, so yes. Okay, so that's good. This episode then, I wanted to basically capture the madness of the Star Wars Holiday Special from 1977 in the form of an episode.
So that's what we're doing here. Basically, they're always at 77, always at 78, one of those two years. A notoriously cursed endeavor with lots of weird segments and strange things going on, and becoming the stuff of legend.
So I want this episode to disappear or offline at some point, and then everyone talks about it in hushed tones. And the only way you can listen to it is if someone passes you a cassette recording of it. Like Jay Bayliss has got like five of them, and he's the only guy on earth with a record of it.
I wanted to have that vibe basically. So what have we got? We've got an alternative Game of the Year Awards situation going on.
What would normally be a box out in a magazine will end up being an hour of this podcast, no doubt. So that's good. Section two, we've got our top five holiday games.
This could be quite a quick list of games that make us feel festive a little bit. That should be fun. And then section three, we've got a Christmas mail bag where listeners are sent in some Christmas experiences.
Some of them are just wholesome, I got this present once, life-changing events. And then others are just like, sort of like tragic events that are played for laughs on this podcast. So that's what we've got, Matthew.
Anything else to sort of like say about this episode?
Well, throughout the episode, we're gonna be visited by guests.
Oh yeah, of course.
It's interesting. You're thinking Star Wars Christmas Special. I was maybe thinking more like Noel's House Party, right?
Throughout this podcast, you're gonna hear the ringing of a doorbell. As long as I can find the sound effect of a doorbell. And then some of our guests who've appeared on the podcast over the years are gonna be popping in to tell us about their game of the year.
And then we will carry on with the podcast without acknowledging what they just said.
Yeah, we did originally plan to respond to them, but because I'm flying to Japan and some of them have not come in yet. So that wasn't possible.
So, yeah. Yeah, they're more like little ad, think of them as like little ad breaks from some of your old favorites telling us about their games of the year. And we'll see how that goes.
So it's gonna be quite chaotic.
Yeah, and again, if any of them get canceled before the episode goes live again, we're not responsible for that. So I'm only joking, of course. And Matthew, maybe we should let the first one play here so people can get an idea of what we're talking about with the old guest popping in.
Should we do that?
Let's do that.
Okay, take it away, guest number one.
Hello, Back Page boys. It's me, Ellie Gibson, off of Ellie Gibson's Go 8-Bit, Ellie Gibson's Twitch stream, Ellie Gibson's Scummy Mummies. Where else have I been in?
Ellie Gibson's Eurogamer. Anyway, thank you very much for having me on the podcast this year. I had a lovely time talking to you, babe.
And I understand you'd like more from me. Who doesn't? Specifically my game of the year, a role I take very seriously, which is why I'm recording this on my phone in the back of a mini cab.
So I want to know what love is. Sorry, I got distracted by the music. The point is, game of the year, it has to be, look.
Oh no, no, please, so don't turn it down. I'm enjoying it. It's helping, it's ambiance.
My game of the year, of course, is the PlayStation 5 port of Power Wash Simulator. Now it's gonna take a little time. I think I'll know that's the song again, isn't it?
To explain. But Power Wash Simulator, of course, is an amazing game. And I haven't just chosen it.
I just wanna be clear. I haven't just chosen it because I am the Guinness World Record holder for the longest time spent playing Power Wash Simulator. Because I did play it, of course, this year for 24 hours, six minutes and 33 seconds.
You were there, Helen.
Yes, she officially did it.
Yeah, I did. She didn't even make it up. You could just fake it, but she didn't.
You can't make it, you've got to have a clocks and all sorts anyway. Oh, sorry. Oh, people are gonna doubt me now.
Oh, honestly, tell you what, don't ever form a comedy double act. Anyway, the point is, honestly, obviously that's partly why I chose it so I could mention my certificate again, but it is a fantastic game. It's so peaceful and enjoyable and, oh, it's just, I love it, I love it.
Of course, when I do play it now, I do have flashbacks to what was quite, it really started to kick in about 3 a.m. from memory when I've been playing for something like 17 hours. That's when I started to go truly mad.
But nonetheless, I enjoyed myself, and the point is I've got a framed certificate on my wall to prove that I did do it. So even if, I wouldn't recommend playing for 24 hours, to be honest, but if you haven't played it, definitely play it. That's my game of the year.
It's much better than that bloody, what's his name? Alan, Alan Woke, I can't remember. Oh, it's a bit, maybe a bit, just honestly, calm down, Alan.
Just have a day off. Anyway, seven out of ten. All right, got to go.
But yes, Merry Christmas and that. Oh, I don't know when this is going out. Happy New Year, I don't know, or just hope you have a nice weekend, depending on when this is broadcast.
Do you broadcast podcasts or do you just publish them? Do you listen to it on a computer? I mean, we've been doing it for 10 years and we still don't know.
But yes, thanks very much for having me and hope this has made some sense. All right. Oh, we're nearly there.
Wow, wasn't that a great bit of podcasting? Truly like transcendent stuff.
A shocking choice. A shocking choice to kick off this episode.
Yeah. So I will say very big thank you to our guests who contributed to this. I basically had like the longest BCC fucking chain.
I basically got in touch with every single guest, apart from Dave Scarborough, whose email I don't have, and Jen's email, I don't have hers either. Everyone else got an email from me being like, do you fancy this? So we'll see who responds.
But yes, it's very nice to have them in here, peppering them around here. So Matthew, section one then, the alternative awards. We've just about made this happen, I think.
We've pulled the rock up a mountain to make some gags happen. So we've got some pretend, I guess like jokey awards here. Is that the best way to describe them?
Well, I take the choices seriously, but the categories are not like, it's like...
Oh yeah, but some of them are like, I was thinking about them and thought, yeah, that's the correct answer. And is the correct answer ever the funny answer? I don't know.
Right, that's tricky. So, okay, so maybe we should just kick off and we'll see where it takes us, Matthew. So category one, I actually won't do that because it sounds like a draft episode.
Best Hang is the first category. Matthew, who have you got for Best Hang for games from 2023?
I mean, this is just a really obscure character from Paranormal Sight.
Is it Norma Sight?
No, I picked, there's this lovely policeman called Jun Iriu and he's got lovely kissy lips. Anyone who's played that game will know what I'm talking about. He kind of puckers his lips at the end of every sentence.
It makes him look quite sort of innocent and naive. Just a good hang.
Okay, great. Interesting.
Is this delivering on the concept?
It's just about, yeah. I think it's sort of like... Good.
We're already deep into the commentary on the concept of the episode. Just minutes into the recording.
Some of them are better than that. But that is, I was just thinking, he seemed like a good hang.
Yeah, so Matthew's saying, we're setting the bar low now. And that means that you can be blown away by whatever comes up along the way, hopefully. So, yeah, okay.
So my best hang. I've got two, actually, two short list here. So I've got Luis in Resi 4 Remake.
He was, you hung out with him in a mine cart and in some other areas in the house, obviously, in the classic set piece. That was good. But I've also got Gav from FF16.
He was like, you know, of the characters in that game where, well, I suppose you can have Sid here as well, actually. Sid was also a good hang, but Gav was just very friendly, you know, heart on his sleeve kind of guy. I think it's got to go to Luis, though.
It was sort of like, you kind of knew he was a good hang coming into Resi 4 Remake, and then Capcom just pushed it a bit further, so he gets the top of the pile. What do you think of that?
I'm on board with that. I liked hanging out with him. I liked having him in there in the boss fight that he wasn't previously in, helping me distract the enemy.
So, yeah, a good hang.
Yeah, I just worry that Leon S. Kennedy lacks sort of like, you know, sort of like male friends who he's got a straightforward relationship with, but the whole Krauser thing just suggests that he struggles to make friends who aren't like demonic sort of maniacs, basically. And that's like, that's unfortunate.
He doesn't really make any friends in Resi 2 Remake because everyone dies. It makes sense to Claire. That's good.
But you know what I mean? Like he doesn't really get to just sort of hang with a guy and be like, oh yeah, I'm having a good time.
I wouldn't describe the settings of those games as like, they're not like social mixers, you know?
No, I suppose not. But, you know, like...
It's not like my true mission tonight is friendship. You know, get the fuck out of Raccoon City.
Yeah, I suppose most of them are kind of colleagues, aren't they? Like Chris and Piers in Resi 6 and our beloved Resi 6. And who's Leon's pal in Resi 6 again?
I can't remember the name.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, very good then. Okay, we move on to the next category, which is Worst Hang. So I'm going to go first here, Matthew.
I'm putting all the NPCs in Pikmin 4 here, including the Spacemen, Ochi and Evil Ochi. They're all going in worst hang. I think that was an absolute cavalcade of bad hangs in that game.
Who have you got?
I've got the host of the Danica cast, Danica from Spider-Man 2.
Oh, great choice. Danica has taken some drive-bys on this podcast. It's been tough.
Well, she should do a better podcast.
It's really, yeah, it's rough. It's like, yeah, if I got an advert for that podcast from, like, while I was listening to a Ringer podcast, I'd have to be like fucking to get Spotify off my phone right now. Just absolutely not.
OK, good, that's fair enough. OK, the critics got this wrong award. Kind of a jokey suggestion here.
But I think, like, we wanted to pick something where me and Matthew were maybe against the grain of how everyone felt about something. Is that how you've approached this one, Matthew?
No, but...
OK, is this where you say that, like, Exo Primal is your game of the year or something?
It's a bit of a soft one, this, for me. I thought people were surprisingly cool on Fire Emblem Engage considering how good I thought it was. And I just thought it was top-tier Fire Emblem.
As good as any Fire Emblem I've played, really. I just felt like all the people who wanted more anime bullshit from Three Houses didn't get it. But actually, it's still got AT or Metacritic.
This one's quite difficult because everything gets AT or Metacritic, right? So it's not, like... It's not too easy to find it.
But there is a more acclaimed game that I know we were both cool on.
Yeah, that's the one I picked, which is Cocoon. Is that what you were thinking of? Yeah.
It was fine, Cocoon, wasn't it? It was, like, not that stimulating, but extremely well made. So it just ended up being a game that weirdly left me cold, despite the fact that it was so dazzling in places.
So, yeah, that was a game that I played. I went into it thinking, I think we both said this. This is an easy entry on both of our Game of the Year lists coming up.
Here we go. And then it wasn't. It was no Norco, as discussed.
So, yeah. Any further thoughts on Cocoon?
It's not me, Norco.
Very good. Yeah, destined to be the name of a box out one day. So, yeah, so Cocoon.
Do you have any further thoughts on Cocoon, like looking back, Matthew, or were you just sort of like...
No, I've read all these. Actually, there was a great making of on, I want to say Eurogamer, which talked about how long they spent on this game and how many iterations it went through, and that it was a lot more complicated. And then they kept boiling it down.
And given that my problem with it is, I think it's been sanded down to like almost non-existent difficulty. It's such a smooth trip that my brain didn't really engage with any of it. It was interesting hearing that that was a deliberate process.
And maybe, I don't know, maybe I think they took it too far.
That's fair enough. So yeah, I think I felt the same way, basically. And Fire Emblem is a weird one, because I did play this at the start of the year.
I thought, oh, just jump on with Fire Emblem here, because I played a bit of Three Houses and found some of the out of battle stuff a little bit time intensive, I would say. And this game actually does have lots of anime bullshit in it, despite what you just said, but it's different anime bullshit. It's a bit more juvenile and kind of like, I don't know, it feels like it's aimed at a slightly younger audience, maybe.
It's got a little...
But the actual, the battling bit, which I just thought I did more of that than anything else, which was already a big tick. I just thought it was sublime. I love the system of kind of building the characters, matching them with the, you know, the old Fire Emblem characters and giving them all these like crazy builds.
This just, yeah, really scratched an itch and is definitely still in contention for going in my top 10.
Yeah, I think it's... I liked what I played. I think I got 10 chapters in, something like that.
Right.
And I thought the battles were really good, so it definitely gets a tick in that box. I think that it's suffering from the slight thing of... A few years ago, there was this thing of like, oh, is Fire Emblem actually going to exist after this entry, like with Awakenings, right?
That was like the whole thing with it. And then now we're kind of at the point where maybe people are taking Fire Emblem for granted slightly, that having like a really good, you know, tactics game, like turn-based tactics game is something that you can take for granted when you've had a few of them on the trot and they've all been pretty great.
Yeah.
There's a bit of a risk of that, but I do agree. I think it was like, yeah, definitely, it was a great game to start the year off as well. Like a great January game, you know?
So, yeah.
And I think just because I read some slightly cooler stuff on it, maybe I was pleasantly surprised by it, you know? Maybe I was reacting to that, but, you know, whatever. It's got a fond place in my mind.
Okay, yeah, fair. Okay, so next category is the most surprising game of this year, for better or worse. Should I go first, Matthew?
Yeah, I actually haven't got one for this.
Oh, I got two. So do you want to have one of mine? I mean, I've got...
You tell me yours, so maybe it will inspire me.
Okay, so I think, like, Hi-Fi Rush should probably go in here, because...
Oh, that's a good shout.
It truly was a surprise, you know. It sprung out of nowhere. It was, you know, it's kind of like a combination of a couple of different game types, really.
You know, it's like a bit of a mix of hack and slash and rhythm action, and that was new. So it's surprising in that respect, too. It's surprising in how it looked for a Tango GameWorks game.
And yeah, it was a great, another great start to the year kind of game, right? Just a real cool, cool thing to kick things off. I didn't finish it, unfortunately.
I got about five hours in, and I may actually go back and finish it before we do a Game of the Year episode, if I just about get to it. So we'll see. But yeah, it was, that was a surprise.
I was just going to say Exo Primal. That was another one. I thought, I think that game is doomed to be remembered as the game Capcom made instead of the Dino Crisis game that people on Twitter wish they made.
But it's actually like, it's pretty cool, despite the repetition and the obvious flaws in it. It was like a really good seven, as I described on whatever episode we discussed it this year. Any thoughts on either of those, Matthew?
Definitely Hi-Fi Rush as a literal surprise. That works. Exo Primal, I just never gave it a proper go, really.
Like it was on a concert work and I tried a few fights. I don't know if you'd need to put in a bit more time for that thing to really like blossom out, but it didn't quite do it for me. Actually, I guess like a surprise of sorts was just how massive Borders Gate 3 was.
Right, right.
The way it just sort of dominated the conversation and is seen as this shoe-in for awards now. You know, it seems to be the one to beat at the Game Awards, which given that, like the quality of the very best games of this year, is kind of... that's kind of mad to me.
Not as in I don't rate Borders Gate 3, but that it has so easily sort of sauntered to top of the pile. You know, I had full faith it was going to be amazing, but not that it was going to find this kind of mainstream acceptance. Okay, I still don't really understand it as a phenomenon, because it's a complicated old game and quite messy, and it asks you to have to take a bit of a leap of faith with it in many ways.
All the things games aren't meant to do, it does. You know, it's kind of chaotic, and it isn't sanded down to within an inch of its life, and yet here we are. It's, yeah, a pleasant surprise.
Yeah, it's interesting that that game has become... It feels like a sign of the times in some ways of what people want from their games. It's like they are willing to put up with something very complex to get the things that they want, which is characters they really like and a world they really like and good storytelling, that people will happily endure that next layer of, I guess, sophistication in the mechanics.
So where that leads to is going to be interesting because in some ways it doesn't really adhere to all of the kind of like, like you said, the sanding down bits that we've seen in other blockbusters for the past, I don't know, 10 or 15 years, right? The ways they make it a bit simpler. So yeah, curious to see what that leads to long term because people will buy millions of copies of this and they don't mind the complexity, which is just fascinating, I agree.
So do you want to read this next category out Matthew?
Oh, I think I might hear a doorbell, Sam.
Oi, oi. I'm not quite sure why I said that, but that's what you're getting because I'm only doing one take of this. Simon from IGN here to tell you what my favourite game of the year is, but only if it were that simple.
It's been a classic tale of head versus heart for me at the end of this year, I think. I've been thinking a lot about this, as you know, having to do votes left, right and centre for this sort of thing, but as you will have heard on our episode a few weeks back, Remedy do have a huge place in my heart and Alan Waite 2 pretty much fulfilled everything I wanted that game to be, I think. It's one of the best horror games I've played in a very long time, and I think probably Remedy's best today.
I'm not 100% sure on that yet. Don't lock me in on that. Now, I usually do let my heart win overhead in situations like this, but this year, I'm afraid I'm just...
I'm going to take the more sensible route and listen to my brain and pick Baldur's Gate 3. Or maybe I just, I don't know, maybe I have one of those little illithid tadpole things squirming around in my head telling me what to do. I don't know.
Either way, it's Baldur's Gate 3 this year. Playing Baldur's Gate 3 and thinking about it gives me a headache just when I think about how the hell did they make this thing? The number of overlapping systems and how every decision, like, you know, just impacts on 70 hours down the road.
Like the sheer amount of dialogue in this game. I don't know how many thousands of lines of dialogue there are. It's absurd.
Just the deep combat mechanics, which you can kind of just kind of not engage with completely if you don't want to. And that's just, you know, it's all just so endlessly impressive. The way they build all this for you and kind of let you create your own story in it.
It's rare to play a game for around 100 hours and feel like every single mouse click or button press was of importance. But somehow Larian managed that. It's just a bit of madness to me.
It's magic, dark magic. I don't know. Maybe I do have one of those tadpoles in there.
Who knows? But I just, I felt fully satisfied with my adventure in that game and still feel like I didn't even see half of what it had to offer. I can't really wait to jump back in and really explore what the dark urge has in store for me because I feel like maybe that's my destiny.
I'm not even really a D&D person or really a classic CRPG person really, but Baldur's Gate 3 just captured my imagination like no other game this year and for that reason. I think it has to be my favorite of 2023. Plus, it's the only game I accidentally sent a gnome flying off for spinning when milled to his death in, so just banging stuff really.
Great stuff.
Yeah, seamless. So, do you want to read this next category Matthew?
Most spectacular set piece.
Yeah, I actually just did this one today, but I thought this is kind of like the best set piece of a game with great set pieces, which is all I'll say is that there is a bit at the end of Final Fantasy 16 where three summons team up to fight like the big bad of the game and it's fucking amazing and I just had a great time watching that. I technically didn't play much of it really. Right, there is that.
I guess I could also throw in one of the ifrit bits that are early in the game. What's the one where he's running towards that dude in the distance? That's really good.
The Titan fight.
Yeah, the Titan fight. That might be the one to pick instead because that is interactive and you have some really cool sort of mix of QTEs, but also some actual proper control. That's really, really good.
AKA the bit we think Platinum probably made.
Yeah. But yeah, FS16 definitely thrives at this. There's no other Final Fantasy where I'd say the set pieces are what you should celebrate, but it's something that 16 does really well.
But what have you got for this, Matthew?
I really liked the big bit with the massive drill on the desert planet in Jedi Survivor. That whole sequence where you kind of go into the temple with, who's that green witch lady?
Oh, I don't remember her name, unfortunately.
You know, her... She's the character from the first one. You're like...
His girlfriend?
Yeah, Cal's like girlfriend anyway. She's like a witch. She's a Dathomirian Nightsister.
How do I remember that?
But not her name!
That's crazy. Anyway, yes, she's one of those. And you go into this big temple, and there's this big robot mining machine thing.
It sort of starts chewing at the temple, and you do a mad escape from it. And she uses all these portals to teleport you out. And it's just a mad dash doing this really long chain of kind of like wall running and acrobatics, but also jumping through these portals, which keep kind of whisking you out, ratchet and clank style, into other bits of that boss fight.
And it's quite a linear platforming set piece, but that's exciting.
Meren's her name, by the way.
Meren, that's it. Is it a spoiler to talk about the portals bit in Spider-Man 2?
I think it's okay, because it's firmly in the first half of the game. I think that's okay.
Yeah, that's quite a fun sort of out of nowhere mission in Spider-Man 2, where you are called to Doctor Strange's house, and for a second you think, oh shit, Doctor Strange is going to be here. That's really exciting. He doesn't turn up sadly, but someone does nick something from his house, which lets them create portals, and you then start chasing her through New York, through these portals, and you go through one of them, and you're suddenly in the Arctic for five seconds, then you go through a portal and you're back in the city.
And again, it's that kind of fast-loading tech that they created for Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, but used to a more spectacular effect here, I would say. That was good. For people who haven't finished Tear of the Kingdom, I thought the last boss fight in that was absolutely brilliant.
I thought that was an amazing end to the game, and much stronger than the end of Breath of the Wild. But I did really like the Colgera boss fights in the Winter Temple, where you're kind of... the kind of flying one with the big dragon, where you kind of smash through the portions of its body, and it plays that great piece of music.
Yeah, I really liked that as well.
I thought that boss was quite a pain in the arse, actually, because it didn't give you enough space to navigate around its big whirlpool-y things, and you just couldn't avoid them sometimes, and it just felt like a big fuck show.
I didn't have any problems. I don't know. I don't know what that says.
Okay, well, obviously...
There's one of those things in the depths below. You can just go and fight it for fun, and I have fought that thing again just because I enjoyed it so much.
Just to make the point, this deserves the win in this category.
No, I'm not saying it deserves the win. I don't know which of these. I'd probably make the...
I don't know. I don't mind.
No, that's fair enough. Yeah, I was going to say that... Well, I already did mine once for this, didn't I?
Sorry, I'm getting confused with a different category where some of this stuff might come up again. Okay, cool. So next category, this is one of yours, Matthew, isn't it?
Best ox patting.
Yeah, so I picked the Coney Island bit in Spider-Man 2. It felt like the...
Same here.
Yeah, like, there wasn't much ox patting this year, really, was there? But was Spider-Man the only game that really had any? Just for people who maybe don't listen to podcasts as much, ox patting is basically like a traditional...
The actual gameplay systems of the game are chucked out, so there's some nice little interactive narrative bits with some cinematic polish. That's basically what we're talking about. Named after the ox patting from Uncharted 2, and there was also a bit where you ride an ox for about four hours in God of War Ragnarok last year.
So, yeah. So, yeah, was there anything else this year that did this?
There was a little bit of it in Jedi Survivor again.
Yeah, I suppose so.
There was that little sequence at the start where you think he's imprisoned and you kind of get taken through the city and everyone's kind of making fun of you and then you get to unleash some Jedi magic on them. So that's quite fun. Yeah, it hasn't been a big year for this, but then, you know, there haven't been loads of Sony first party games.
That is true. OK, so this is a fun one. Did this need a remake or remaster award?
Obviously this goes to a Resident Evil 4 remake. I'm only joking. It probably didn't need a remake, to be honest, but I did think that redoing Layers of Fear 1 and 2...
I looked up, did any SpongeBob games come out this year? One did, but it wasn't actually like a remake of a PS2 game, as I thought. It's actually a new game.
So Layers of Fear wins this one for me.
That's perfect.
No, no, it's OK. Ding dong! I hear the bell going off, Matthew.
Hello, boys. It's been a while. I'm Joe Scrabbles.
I was recently referred to as a friend of the show, which was nice. So here I am, in a spirit of friendly cooperation, to offer a Game of the Year pick. I'm pretty sure all the sort of...
Actually, I was going to say all the big games will be taken, but you've got a higher class of guests, myself very much included, so I bet there will be some notable omissions. But I'm still going to go alternative with my pick, which is Ducent, the lovely French game about climbing an inordinately large tower. I loved Ducent.
For some reason, I really like games that make climbing difficult, which is odd because I don't climb. I tried climbing two or three times and just lifting my sheer heft off the floor and then realising how much harder I'd hit the floor because of said heft really freaked me out. And it was hard because I'm fat.
But there's just something about a game that makes a mechanic that is rendered so simple in so many other games more difficult that really appeals to me. And it's why I'm the only person in existence who liked Ubisoft's I Am Alive, if you remember that game. And it's also why I like Ducent.
Ducent is really pretty. It's got a lovely, sort of quietly told narrative that takes in lots of nice progressive themes and has a sort of vaguely French anime outlook on its characters. It's got elements of eco almost in the way it builds the world around you without directly telling you what's going on.
But it's the climbing. Just the way it maps each of your hands to a trigger, putting in a piton as sort of a strategic marker of where you think you can continue to climb from, but making that a limited resource. A stamina system that sort of urges you on but never makes you feel like you're fully failing.
And then it starts building extra puzzles around that with sort of moving handholds and wind and sun that saps your energy faster. And then you start realising that there's a critical path but there's tons of hidden bits. Some of them almost purely visual, hidden around the world.
So it starts testing on where you think you can climb as much as where you have to climb. It's just a really lovely compact piece of interesting game design. And there hasn't been much else I've played this year that's made me marvel at the work behind it in quite the same way.
So yes, go and play Juson. It's really cool. You'll be cooler for having played it.
And if you have someone else on to do your slightly abortive series of indie game Hall of Fames, which I'm assuming you haven't repeated because it tanked when I was last on it, and said guest does not put Juson in that list, then they've not failed. They just haven't listened to this bit. Love you.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, it was nice seeing them again.
Oh, great. It's great when they come to stay, but it's always nice when they leave. Very good.
I am actually going to use a ding-dong.
Yeah, good. So I don't need to keep saying ding-dong.
No.
If anything, that's probably making it worse, isn't it?
No, I mean, it's fun. I'll cut them out and put them all at the end.
Oh, great. What a nice thing to do. So, what a cool mechanic just made just for this game award.
I've got a very specific thing in mind for this one, Matthew. Did you manage to come up with an idea for this?
Well, I thought of Ascend from Tears of the Kingdom.
Oh, yeah. Oh, great. That's a great choice.
Yeah, really good.
You know, like, the ability to just drill Link through anything above him until he comes out the other side ends up, you know, being at the heart of loads of great puzzles and also just a really useful tool that allows them to have a lot of caves and things, which instead of you having to backtrack, you can just swim through the earth and pop out of, and, you know, as a technical feat, it feels kind of like magic. It feels like a power that most people would be terrified to give you, but, you know, just one of many parts of Tears of the Kingdom's excellence.
Yeah, I think it's, I thought this was really good for a few reasons. One, you needed to be close enough to the ceiling in order to actually activate it, so you couldn't turn it on all the time. And at the same time, I think it taps into that mentality of turning no clipping mode on in like an old first person shooter and then just going to see what's outside the level kind of thing.
I think it taps into that a little bit, but it's part of the game, which I think is a really nice extension of the power set you get in Breath of the Wild, so I definitely will give the game that to Matthew. So I've got the noisy pull string light in Amnesia the Bunker, basically to have light to see where you're going. You need to pull this string like three times, I think it is, and then the light comes on, and it only runs for a little bit of time, and then shuts off again.
And then obviously with the noise attracts the monster, the alien isolation style creature that's pursuing you through this bunker in the game. Not finished this game, but had a very, very good three hours with it, and we'll go back to it at some point. They're definitely the most I've enjoyed one of Frictional's games.
So I just thought that was a really nice horror conceit, you know, a really neat idea. So yeah, pop that in there.
I'll do your impression of it again.
No, I feel like I sound like a fucking idiot now. I can't say, yeah, no, no, we're moving on. Okay, so you put this one in here, didn't you, Matthew?
Yeah, I put this one and then I didn't write down what my entry was, I kind of forgot. This was best hub world slash area.
Yeah, so I picked the Cobra Observatory from Jedi Survivor, the big Imperial base with some X-Wings and TIE Fighters flying around it. That shit was rad, well done, everyone, so that wins. There's some cool bits in FF16, some big fields and stuff, they're quite nice, I guess, but yeah.
What do you got for this one?
Yeah, I was thinking in terms of like a sort of home base, like a hub base that you return to, the ship in Shadow Gambit, the tactics game, is very characterful and you have all these little side missions there and they squeeze a surprising amount out of this very small ship and it just gave that game's campaign a little more sort of shape and kind of coherence that maybe wasn't in Desperados or Shadow Tactics. So yeah, I liked that little pirate ship, but yeah, definitely Final Fantasy 16 had some good areas too.
Yeah, it sure did. I actually just did, I think one of the things that's actually magic about FS16 is that some of the hunts take you to some quite odd areas of the map that don't really have any other function, but you realize they're actually kind of secretly boss arenas for you to go and find later on when these hunts become available, and then you'll just see a big dragon sort of patrolling this enormous marsh where it's quite misty and atmospheric, and you're like, oh, they've actually thought about the environment and how they frame these creatures that you fight, and it's a way to make them feel a little bit special, I think. So I quite like that link between the environment and the things that you fight in that game.
I think that's pretty cool. So yeah, okay. So next category, Banger on the Soundtrack Award.
What do you got for this one, Matthew?
This is a really specific reference, but it stuck out as the highlight of this particular game. In Bayonetta Origins, the spin-off of Bayonetta, sort of set in this picture book world, the music's all very kind of sort of tinkily and fantasy and childlike. It's quite Professor Latiny.
There's a lot of accordions and strings, and you're playing as child Bayonetta, but there's one boss fight where you finally fight one of the angels from later Bayonetta, you fight Affinity, and it's still playing all this accordion fiddle music, but it suddenly breaks into a folky cover of Tomorrow Is Mine from Bayonetta 2.
Just get these two worlds colliding, this kind of picture book world and this kind of attitude of the later game. And I remember just thinking like, that's fucking rad. That's like a five star, 10 out of 10 moment.
I wish there was more of that in this Bayonetta spin-off, but yeah, just a great bit of fan service.
Yeah, that's a nice choice, actually. I kind of forgot that game happened this year, and I don't think it really made much of a difference.
Yeah, one of those weird sort of six, seven out of tens that didn't quite make it.
I feel like I've got to buy it, because at some point, I feel like selling a copy on Switch is going to be like net me 200 pounds or something to some content creator in 20 years. So I might do that as a forward investment.
You've got to speculate to a keen look.
Exactly, this is my version of Stonks, so that's good. Okay, so.
What's your banger?
I'm afraid I have another Final Fantasy 16 entry. I've got to pick On the Shoulders of Giants, the main boss theme from this game, which is just really dramatic and cool. It takes a little while to build up to it, and then some horns pop off, and then it really gets going.
When you say some horns pop off, do you mean trumpets, or do you mean a creature's horns actually pop off and then it gets going?
I do mean trumpets, yeah. Okay. So, you do the boss theme, I mean, I think you hear it a dozen times, it sort of builds up with.
Do one of your little covers for us, I like it when you hum a bit, too.
No, because now I feel very self-conscious about doing it, I can't just do it naturally.
I mean, it's nice.
No, it's like, I sort of like those, no, actually, it's too hard to explain. Again, this is why we don't do it.
You know what, I'll dig it up, I'll play a little excerpt of it right now.
Cheers, good editing. That's much more effort than I've put into our Final Fantasy VII episode and Edit Matthew. We're just like, I'll cut out Matthew's big arms, but that's all he's getting this week.
Oh, thanks.
There's a lot of big arms in that one.
The listeners are gonna get all 58 minutes of your recap of the story of that game.
If they didn't like that, they just won't be listening to this episode anymore. If you manage to get through my full recap of Final Fantasy VII, Disc 1, you're in for the long haul.
Well, that's it. People are listening to this three weeks later. It's already happened.
It's like Tenet, Matthew. Side note, I saw a great comment about one of the, I was watching a scene from Tenet for some reason, so I was using it to explain to a former colleague what our relationship was like. And then basically in the bottom, they said, someone said, oh yeah, I've gone ahead and seen Tenet too, you guys are gonna love it.
I thought it was a good comment, but anyway. I'm a big Tenet head as it previously established.
I really wanna know which bit of Tenet you think you and your colleague were like. I'm assuming it's a Robert Patterson and the protagonist style moment.
Well, who can say? Maybe it's a bit of like Russian Kenneth Branagh. You know what I mean?
Like there could be a bit of that going on.
You're like, I'm like Russian Kenneth Branagh and you're like my terrified wife.
Oh gosh, maybe that is more accurate. Anyway, let's move on. So, okay.
Game I played for 10 minutes on Game Pass and no more than that. What have you got for this one, Matthew?
I technically did play more than 10 minutes in it. There's no game actually qualified that I only played 10 minutes, but I put Redfall for this.
Oh, you would play that for like two hours, don't we, in the end?
Yeah, I know, but that's the closest I got to 10 minutes. Oh, actually that one where you cook all the Indian food.
Venbo, was it?
I was just thinking back to like, my experience of that was trying to bait some kind of dumpling or something, fucking it up too many times and being like, fuck this game and just, I just can't believe I rage quit because I couldn't cook a virtual chapati.
Yeah, a game that's like, you know, probably got like goodness in its heart and only wants to like illuminate and make you feel good and you're like, fuck this, I'm reinstalling Fable 2, you know? So for my, my one is Planet of Lana. It seemed like it was nice enough.
It's kind of like a sort of a bit of a more feel-good-y inside. Well, at least it had a little bit of that vibe to it. But I don't really need any more games like that.
I feel like some of them got that out of my system a little bit. I played like three hours of that. I thought it presentation was amazing, but I don't know if I need more of the old side scrolling sort of like narrative games.
Not unless, it's hard to go after the inside pie. Like that pie is fucking spectacular. You know what I mean?
Like it's to like imitate it is tricky. So yeah, but I wish no ill will towards Planet of Lana. In fact, I wish it well.
So that's good.
Now I'm thinking about pie insides.
Great. It's at the doorbell here again, Matthew.
Hey, Will Porter here talking about the best game of the year. Well, unfortunately, I haven't had much time to play many games this year. And my answer would just be very boring Spider-Man 2.
As such, I've drafted in somebody that does play lots of games and will be able to tell us what's big in the playground, what's been big in the playgrounds in 2023. Like I said, everybody listening to Back Page podcast, to my son Aaron. Hello, Aaron.
It's all right, don't be, they're quiet. They're gentle big men. They're big men, but they're not scary.
Okay, right. Right, so Aaron, what would you say is, what was the game that you've been playing mainly this year, do you think?
Half the time I've been playing Goat Simulator and half the time I haven't, because I lost the disc. And that, because we found it.
Yeah. So you think, well, so technically Goat Simulator 3 we're on, even though it's really Goat Simulator 2. They call it that just for the funnies.
So that came out last year, didn't it? But we've mainly been playing this year. So I guess that kind of counts, because in kid world, that kind of release dates don't really matter, do they?
That's what we've kind of learned. But like, so what's Goat Simulator 3? What do you have to do in it?
It's just really funny, your goat, as it means Goat Simulator, so what else would it be?
What does the goat do, though? What does it get up to?
Just runs around and headbutts people.
Okay, yeah, yeah, so you talk a bit louder.
Louder?
You're a bit louder. Yeah, that's better, yeah, because they moan about, honestly, you wouldn't believe it. You come on this podcast, it's a microphone, this microphone, that.
So yeah, so Goat Simulator 3, so it's basically like a sandbox, it's like a sandbox, isn't it? It's basically like GTA fun and games, but in a kind of family-friendly zone. And it's also a goat, but you can check, but you've unlocked it.
It was the first game that I ever heard swearing in, and I was so happy when I first heard my first swear word. It was, I think it was something like...
Okay, right, yeah. So maybe I should have realized that there might be some swearing in it. But generally, it's quite family-friendly.
And you can kind of, you can drive cars, drive off things. They've got lots of different little quests and stuff in there now, haven't they?
Yeah, which I can't really do.
Yeah, I know, but I know you can't. So Aaron is like rampaging around and I'm just hover over him saying, why don't you do the quest? And you're like, no.
But we did do the quest, didn't we? So what happened when we went through the...
There was a boss battle.
There's a big boss battle. So yeah, so that's one. So what would you say is big?
What's everyone else playing at school?
Fortnite.
Fortnite. Would you like to play Fortnite, Aaron? Why do you not play Fortnite?
Because that's so they're calm.
Well, I think you're probably almost at the Fortnite age. So it's all Fortnite all the time. There's nothing else that the guys can stroke their chins about and go, oh, I didn't realize that was down with the kids.
I mean, he plays a lot of games that he really shouldn't.
Right, we're not, let's not. Okay, right, so yeah, so I think that probably wraps up for now, so like people at school play games they really shouldn't, Fortnite and we play Goat Simulator. All right, cool.
All right, so now we say Merry Christmas.
Merry Kishmas.
Merry Kishmas. What's that from?
Oh, that was nice.
Oh, yeah, fantastic. Just nice they popped in, had a coffee.
Barked at everyone for three minutes about their favorite game and left.
Yeah, very nice. Thank you. Thanks to them for their noble sacrifices, those contributors.
Okay, do you want to read this one, Matthew?
This is the Good For You Award for a game we acknowledge is good while choosing not to participate. Are we saying Good For You? Whenever I read Good For You, I read it in the Christian Bale voice.
Which voice is that?
You know that one where he's having the rampage on set and they record him? And he goes, well, good for you.
Oh, right, yeah. That sounded more like, excuse me, princess.
Walking around going lordy, dordy, dory goes.
How many times did you listen to that in 2009?
That was so good. His voice just swerves from American back to his actual voice.
Yeah, it's chaotic, isn't it?
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass, you fucking prick.
Oh, I love this. This is fresh content. The imitation of Christian Bale from 14 years ago.
Well, good for you, award.
Okay, yeah, I do prefer that, actually. So I put Armand Kors 6 here.
Oh yeah, same.
I've not engaged, you know, people seem to really like it. I don't think I've heard like a continued conversation about how good it is. It felt like it happened in like an isolated moment.
Nah, yeah.
There are like five people who, you can just tell the way they talked about it, they genuinely love this thing and everyone else, it was just, it was all SEO baby.
Wes from PC Gamer, he definitely liked it, but yeah.
Yeah, I read his review convinced me to buy that game.
Excellent, well, there you go.
And I wish him well.
Where's listeners to this, I'm sure he'll enjoy that. Okay, Most Cursed is our next category. I put For Spoken here.
I think it was just like the sort of like whole talking bangle thing, that demo just left us our taste. The fact I ended up buying it for 10 quid with a load of art cards, that was just a quite strange, quite a strange situation. It feels like that ended with that studio being closed as well.
Everything that could have happened, that could have gone wrong with that game felt like it went wrong. So don't ever take on this Matthew.
I put down Gollum, which I watched someone play for 10 minutes at work and just instantly abandoned.
Gollum's a better shout than For Spoken actually. That's a good one.
I don't know, they've both got that energy. Does Gollum seem so misguided? It has to be.
Surely the worst game Edge has ever put on its cover. When you get the proper announcement treatment in Edge and they talk such a good game and it's very trusting, isn't it? That it's going to be this thing.
And then it was just, yeah, so bad. I'll tell you what's really cursed. Did you see any of the Switch footage of the Harry Potter port?
Oh, gosh, no, I didn't. Is it really, is it rough?
Yeah, that's cursed. Because all the Mortal Kombat, actually it was a double whammy for Warners this year between that one and the Mortal Kombat one on Switch.
Oh yeah, that one I did see, yeah, amazing. That face was my face when I thought about the idea of making a full podcast schedule in December. That like, yeah, amazing, yeah.
Yeah, they were, they were, that was good fun.
Yeah, that was very good. Yeah, those are good choices, actually. I sort of like, the sort of, the dodgy Switch port, I feel like has subsided a bit in recent years.
I feel like people take fewer big swings now and they're a bit more like realistic. Like they canceled Midnight Suns on Switch this year and they just put it on Xbox One and PS4, which would make more sense, right? They feel like the right systems for it.
But yeah, the idea of the Switch running that game, implausible, you know?
You must know if you've made something like that, that you're looking at it going, this is not good. And we're gonna get in trouble for this.
They knew, they knew.
Just every step of the way, there's the people who made it, then showing it to Warner's and going, ta-da! And then there's Warner's going, well, let's put it out and see what happens. I genuinely wish them all well.
Must have been a really tough gig.
Yeah, there's no winners in that situation, really.
No, no, but also funny.
Good shout, Matthew. So, biggest existential crisis trigger. This is one of yours.
What have you got for this one, Matthew?
Killing myself in Pavlov.
Great times, yeah. Good stuff, that was, yeah.
This is the Pavlov Award. I just wanted to bring it up again for anyone who's forgotten.
Oh, I've just bought Pavlov Shack. I got like, some guy on Real Buck had like a referral code. I got 25% off of it.
So, 11 pound 24, and I will stab myself in the chest, and I will shoot myself in the head, definitely.
The word shack makes it sound even more sinister.
Yeah, Pavlov Shack.
What does the shack signify?
I don't know, it's got like, sort of like grim abandoned hut feel to it, hasn't it?
Shack, yeah. But is that like, you can go into a shack and shoot yourself in the head, which is even worse than just doing it in a multiplayer map in front of people.
Well, I think it is just like a more pared down version of the Pavlov experience. But I think, Ian from Eurogames just did a sort of video about like a sponsored stream, and it did look quite funny. He was going up to some guy and like, knifing him in the arse.
I thought, okay, well that looks like a game. I'm going to play this and have some thoughts on it at some point. So that's definitely happening.
He went up and knifed a guy in the arse.
Well, not that specifically. I'm just saying that a lot of like what Matthew promised me would be in Pavlov looks to be in this version too.
Oh yeah, it's really like, people love it. It's absolutely horrible, that game. Like it was the closest thing to probably what it is like to shoot a person.
And that's a no from me, Tom.
Fair. My existential crisis is a little bit lighter than that. So I was quite surprised to learn, I was quite saddened to learn I'm a fan of The Weeknd this year.
I ended up buying that entire Beat Saber pack of songs that he did in VR and got quite into that, especially the last couple of months. And I thought, I was like so out on that guy. I was like, laughing at his ridiculous HBO show that happened this year.
That was so embarrassing, that one. What's it called? The Idol.
I watched one episode of that and it was the worst shit I've ever seen, so bad. It has nothing to do with him being like good friends with John Denton, of course, me getting into his music. But yeah, gave his music a go and I'm sad to say I've gotten quite into it now.
And so yeah, I'm afraid I've been enjoying that shit. So a light existential crisis.
That's all right. It's another benefit of being in full command of your space.
Yeah, I suppose that was the biggest existential crisis when you pointed out how profoundly single I was to keep buying like random hardware bullshit or whatever. Okay, good. I haven't got a winner for this next category, Matthew.
This is the I've thought of a new Reciper award for best virtual food.
He doesn't say Reciper. He's not fucking Cartman from South Park. He says Reciper.
He says Reciper. Reciper. That's how I tried to show that on the page.
I'm sorry, but you acknowledge he says Reciper in a funny way.
He does. He does acknowledge that. I'm on the record saying that.
Reciper.
Yeah, okay, good.
Okay, he doesn't go, Re-peh-seh-bah.
Re-peh-seh-bah.
This is going a bit Star Wars Holiday Special now, yeah.
Sea of Stars.
Oh, good pick, yeah.
Great food. I mean, it is just the cooking mechanic from Final Fantasy XV in that when you camp, you can use the ingredients you've collected to cook food, except it's all obviously done in a 16-bit art style, so you get to see little 16-bit meals be prepared and all the vegetables get sliced up and the little illustrations and the chopping noises are really nicely done. Very tasty.
I licked my lips a lot during Sea of Stars.
Tough break for Vember, a game all about cooking that you were like, oh, fuck this or whatever, like whatever the food was you're making and it just like this piece of shit meal and you were like, forget this and deleting it from your Xbox.
Oh, yeah. Vember was good.
Again, Matthew wishes it well, so that's good. Okay, right then. So next category, least satisfying side content.
So this has to go to Final Fantasy 16, doesn't it?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, like the amount of fucking like, would you go into a town and someone would be like, Clive, I need you to go get me some onions or whatever. And it's like, I just want to end this immediately, this is terrible that I'm doing this. And that happened over and over again, it's like, you'd hear people say, that stew isn't very thick.
And I was like, do not fucking ask me to go and get some more stew ingredients, I would rather die than do this. And it's like that, I think, combined with the sort of like, absolute shotgunning of regional accents from the UK in this game, I just thought I was knackered just listening to people in this game. I was like, so many regions, I had to take it at once, I just took took some real damage from that.
What do you think, Matthew?
Yeah, this is all I had for this one. It could have almost gotten away with it if they were a bit sillier in the framing. I can see a version of this, which is a bit more like Yakuza, in that there's not many ways you have of actually interacting with the game.
You could just walk around, talk and fight, which is all you can really do in Yakuza too. But in this one, a quest would just, it wouldn't be like just go and get some onions and something crazy happens. It would just be like, thanks, now we can have a delicious stew, and that isn't quite the punchline you want.
And they just kept coming. When you're in the final stretch of that game and then the world floods with tasks again, you're like, I just can't do this anymore.
Yeah, yeah, okay, fair enough. That's, I think that's basically like we're on the same page there then. That's good.
I will give a shout out though to Sign Guy from Tears of the Kingdom, like that guy, every time I saw him I was like, fuck this, like, no.
This is just, you just don't get that game. That's good content.
I get that, like, I get why it should be good, and yet in solving it I never have fun or a good time. I never have a good time. I'm just like, oh, thank fuck, that's over.
That's how I feel every time I do one of those, basically. So yeah, it just didn't happen, did it this year for me, that week, that game.
That's tough. No, this game of the year is gonna be a joy.
Good stuff.
There's gonna be a lot of heart breaking in that episode.
Yeah, I think so.
Maybe there'll be some surprises and other shocks, we'll see.
Okay, interesting. It's sort of like, Matthew's gonna try and knife in the back, like, three of my favourite games to make up for me, like, being out on Tears of the Kingdom, that's gonna be…
Not at all.
No, okay, you're not that petty. You wouldn't sabotage your own list for a laugh, would you?
No, no, no.
That's not the kind of man you are. Okay, worst discourse. What have you got for this one, Matthew?
Any conversation around Mario's voice, whether that's Chris Pratt as Mario or, like, the mystery of Mario's voice in the new game, or do we like Mario's voice in the new game? I can't think of a thing I give a less of a shit about than Mario's voice.
Right.
Instant mute from me on Twitter if I saw you engaging with that in a serious way. I was like, no, but you're boring if you have thoughts about that, and I just can't be dealing with that. The discourse I really hated was the, whatever the fuck happened after Borders Gate 3 with the, don't expect this from indie studios.
Do you remember that?
Yeah, like, is this bad for expectations or something like that?
Because the game was so massive and everyone was thinking about it, it just pulled everyone into it, and everyone had to have, not necessarily on this issue, but everyone had to have a take or wanted to have a bit of Borders Gate 3 content in their lives. And so you ended up getting, like, just weird, weird shit, there was like some jealousy mixed in with just things which are so obvious they shouldn't need to be said. Every big game kind of attracts this, and because this was, like, surprisingly big and popular, it was particularly tiresome.
I don't think anyone was saying they now expect every game to be like this, and yet suddenly everyone was like, well, it's outrageous, you should argue that, and you're like, no one is arguing that. I don't know where this came from. Tiresome.
Tiresome bullshit. And another wave of mutes.
Matthew's down to, like, three people on Twitter now.
Oh yeah, basically. My Twitter is fucking rubbish now, because I've muted half the people. It doesn't give me half the other people that I do follow and I want to hear from, because whatever the fuck's going on with how it serves up tweets now.
And BlueSky is just like two maniacs who love BlueSky on there all the time.
Me and, who else is on there?
Jim Rossingle.
Andy Kelly's on there as well.
I get a lot of Jim. What he says is interesting, but he is like, that thing is 90% Jim.
I quite like the idea that BlueSky is just Jim's blog though. It's like you get early RPS, but it's just on BlueSky. You know what I mean?
That is very much the experience I'm having right now.
Yeah. So, controversially, I thought the worst discourse was the people arguing about that guy who didn't want to pay influencers for content for coverage last week. Because one of those things where I was like, well, actually, I think that people, maybe the thing people were getting upset about was that there was a comment about there being no coverage for this game or something.
But I think the idea that anyone owed money for coverage, even with the best, however much work you put into something, you still never really owed anything. And that applies to this podcast as well. We're not owed Patreon pledges.
It's just whether people value it enough to support it, really. And I think that's kind of true with everything. It's like there's nothing owed, you just have to operate by that premise.
But it was more, I think, the whiplash of being a journalist who remembers Gamergate and being accused of being paid off by absolute bell and commonsers over and over again. And then just like that being a standard part of your work. And then there being this paradigm where your expectations are such that you expect to be paid.
And I just found that quite strange, honestly. So that was like, I think in general, I was just like, it's a no from me dog on this entire thing. I was just like, contain the damage and I'll just walk away, you know?
I think the Baldur's Gate 3 thing was worse because it was more far reaching. That said, Matthew, if you were Bioware and you have to release a Dragon Age game next year, would you not be a little bit nervous about coming after Baldur's Gate 3? Would that not be a real thing that you'd worry about?
I mean, I guess I'm like, concerned trolling here, as they would say. But what do you think?
They are one of the few people who does have the resources to make a game like this. I don't really have too much sort of pity for fur. You know, you've got to see what they make first, you know, it's impossible to say.
But I don't know, I just felt it was more like the idea that like a one person team would be like, it's outrageous that you think I have to make Baldur's Gate 3. And it's like, no one's saying that one person, like that's obviously mad, you know?
Yeah, that's fair enough.
Bioware, maybe one of the only people where you're like, well Bioware, maybe you should make a great game like this. And you probably could. But I don't want to be armchair developer, because what the fuck do I know?
Okay, fair enough.
Hello, Samuel Matthew, not Jeremy Beale here, also known as Jamie Smith. I think we all agree that 2023 has been a stellar year for game releases. But I want to fly the flag for Jedi Survivor, as it's quite possibly one of the best Star Wars games to date, but it seems to have gotten criminally overlooked.
Unfortunately, it released during a cursed summer window, in which it found itself caught sandwiched between an overblown narrative about its performance and a series of flaming penis gifs on Twitter, clearly showcasing the benefits of Tears of the Kingdom there. Jedi Survivor, though, is the quintessential AAA sequel. It improves upon almost everything in the original, starting with the character's moveset, which begins with Fallen Order left off.
Cal Kestis is a versatile and responsive hero that is now complemented by enhanced skill trees that progress numerous force-sensitive abilities, and several different fighting stances clearly influenced by prominent characters in the canon, though I refused personally to use the blaster stance unless it was related to a trophy. Both the narrative and gameplay is well paced, Cal himself is much more Enderian thanks to well-written dialogue, a more authoritative demeanor and customization enhancements, although I'm also not sure who is forgetful enough to leave the goaty beards within one of the many swamps. Improved visuals and variety of locations, combined with slick traversal gameplay and satisfying light saber combat, amount to a well-rounded adventure that has torn down the excessive backtracking, and the egregious souls-like influence of the previous entry.
I played under Jedi Knight difficulty which I can recommend, but this can be softened further due to a variety of perks, or some can make it more abrasive in New Game Plus. There are a few side activities that wouldn't look too out of place in the Like A Dragon franchise, especially the VR board game, as well as a couple of cheeky fanservice nods as well. For the trophy hunters out there, the 55 or so hours to achieve platinum is well worth the investment, as there are some interesting boss encounters and secrets to uncover along the way, especially when returning to the earlier areas.
Overall, I think this was unfairly judged upon release, and for those who passed it by, you can likely pick this up for a steal now that the commotion has settled down. Several patch improvements have came out since. I think it's my personal game of the year, and I had expectations prior to release, and now I'm just hopeful that a future follow-up will cement the trilogy's legacy.
Better than the prequels, anyway. That's all from me. Good tidings to all.
Okay, so we move on to the much lighter category of the If I Was A Thirsty Overly Online Person, This Is The Character I Would Thirst For award. Brackets, this is not a horny podcast. What have you got for this one, Matthew?
The Mean Mum from Final Fantasy 16.
Oh, gosh, yeah. Yeah, I see it. Definitely.
Yep. Okay, yeah. I think you and I are aligned on that one, Dol.
But she's so mean.
She is mean. But yeah, you do sort of see it, though. Like, she's sort of like basically sort of Cersei Lannister, isn't she?
That's her whole vibe.
Oh, yeah, 100%. She seems stern. She seems mean.
The thing is, it would never happen because I just don't have any power.
Yeah, you wouldn't be able to, like, you know, there would be nothing in it for her to, like, for you to give her a child.
Behind the scenes, she's conniving because she wants to get her hand on, like, all my alias box heads.
Which is, of course, why Catherine married you, you know, like she was...
Yeah, well, no one in their right mind would... I've got nothing you need to scam out of me. Nothing I wouldn't willingly give away.
Maybe my Japanese crying collection.
Yeah, I mean, that's worth quite a bit of money. Yeah, that's worth quite a bit of money. What happened to that sort of, like, dud son that she has?
She has a dud son at some point, right? Like, her version is like a lesser Lannister child.
Yeah, well, she has... Yeah, because he's the one that she's kind of... She's plotting to kind of replace Dion as the kind of prince of whatever that kingdom is.
Yeah, but does it turn out...
You know, that place that gets blown up and then you're like, cool, can't wait to inherit this smoldering pile of ashes.
I'm going to be honest with you. I know the names of none of the places in this. Like, Walood, Sandbrek.
I don't know which one each is. I have no idea.
It's the sort of French-sounding one.
Yeah, Sandbrek would be that one then. So, yeah, I think that's a good pick for this award. I guess, like, a runner-up award for MJ from Spider-Man 2.
You know, that's it, though. There's nothing more to be said about this one. We move on.
But that's only if I will. I'm not a thirsty, over-the-online person, so I don't actually think that.
We are Louis Theroux-esque, outside observers, like, looking at other people being horny and noting it. That's what we're doing in this. That's our position in this ecosystem.
Yes.
Okay, most irritating hardware launch. I've got an answer for this one of you, Matthew.
I haven't, but this feels like you've just included this one because you wanted to get it off your chest. The floor is yours.
New colors for the analog pocket. That's been tough this year. I think it's just, I can't be doing with, like, demand-based, like, you've got to be online at this time to get the thing, or you're fucked.
Like, that's... We did that in the pandemic with PS5s and Xboxes. I can't do it again.
I'm not doing it again. Like, it should be in stock when I just rock up on a Sunday afternoon or whatever. Like, just either just make more of them, or release bigger batches more infrequently, something like that.
But, yeah, that sort of thing is like... That's like the number one obstacle to be getting an analog pocket. I think I cover it very much, so, yeah.
I just don't cover it. I just... It's not even...
I mean, it's on my radar, but not as a thing I would ever buy. I just don't know why you need it, really.
Well, that's exactly... That's the attitude that stopped us from having a Game Boy draft, Matthew.
Yeah, but you can play these things on so many other devices.
It's true. Yeah, it's true.
Who needs an analogue pocket when you've got the Nintendo Switch Online service?
Well, that's got quite a lot of good Game Boy games in it.
Yeah, there are, but I know that will make people hiss and puke.
Yeah, and in another five years, they'll have like three more games on there or something. It'll be good. So, yeah.
Okay. Last award, Most Eyebrow-Raising Livestream Moment brought to you by DoorDash. This has to be the FF7 DoorDash thing, where people thought an FF7 Rebirth Reveal was coming, and it wasn't.
It was actually an advert for DoorDash during the Jeff Keeney Livestream this year. Some of Jeff's best. So, great memories.
What a good time. You know, E3 is gone, but we have DoorDash, so that's good. Okay, Matthew, that's it.
Anything else? DoorDash sounds like a NES game, doesn't it?
It does, yeah. Like Paperboy or something, you know? Yeah, DoorDash.
Yeah, okay.
That's my final thought on it.
That's good. Those are the awards, Matthew, but is there time for one more knock of the door before the year of the break?
Yes, there is.
Let's see what's in Santa's parcel package? I don't know.
No, it's a person outside the door.
Yeah, okay, fair enough. And it's holiday as well, not Christmas. It's like, you know, non-denominational basically.
Okay, good.
Samuel Matthew Simon-Parkin here, previous guest of your show and also the presenter, if that is the word of the My Perfect Console podcast. Before I start, I just want to say thank you so much for all the work you've put into Back Page. I listen to episodes while out walking my dog, while driving my car, while sitting on trains.
It's just been a wonderful accompaniment, comforting thing to listen to every week. And I'm sure I speak for all the listeners when I just say thank you so much for all the time and effort you put into it. Even Gamescourt.
So you asked me to pick out one of my favourite games of the year. I thought I would turn it a bit meta because one of the things that I like to do when I'm listening to an episode of Back Page Pod is imagine I'm playing a drinking game. I'm not actually drinking because I'm driving a car, which would be illegal or I'm sitting on a train.
So drinking would be unseemly. But I imagine every time one of these phrases comes up on the podcast that I'm, I don't know, necking a shot of tequila or something. Anyway, some of these phrases are cursed.
If something if something's cursed, you have to take a drink. Two Giant Men. If you refer to yourself as Two Giant Men, that's another drink.
If Matthew disses Way Forward, that's a that's a stiff drink you got to take there. That happens usually once an episode. A Tough Hang.
I'm not sure if you invented that one, but that is just a phrase that's always rattling around in my head whenever you you do the podcast. I love it when Samuel you refer to Matthew as Matthew. I know that's his name and what else you're going to do, but there's just a particular way you say it.
So every time Samuel says Matthew, you have to take a drink. Also, if Samuel you're referring to a game that's in development that could go either way, but you're sort of feeling optimistic about it. You often say that you hope they land the plane.
You're going to need to take a shot every time that happens. Those are just some of the phrases I've got. This is all said in absolute love.
If you didn't say these phrases, I would be extremely upset when I'm listening to the podcast. So I hope you take that in the spirit as intended. And please don't do that for my episode.
My podcast, for sure.
There's about a million things that I say every episode. So yeah, I don't know all of that. That's that's been the game I've enjoyed playing this year.
Well, while hanging out with you two, not a tough hang. The opposite of that. I can't remember what it is that you say when it's not a tough hang.
A good hang? I can't remember anyway. You'll put me right, I'm sure.
Thanks again. Have a lovely holiday. Samuel, have a great trip to Japan and have a good time off.
And yeah, see you in 2024.
Oh, great.
Just always lovely to hear from that, whoever that person is. Yeah, just wonderful, really. Great insight on one of the year's top producers.
I will say one of the reasons that Exo Primal has a special place in my heart this year is just one of the games where we talked about in the podcast and then I got like a series of DMs from Joe Scrabbles. And that's always a sign of a good episode to me or like good takes. He was like, I'm a big Exo Primal guy.
And I was like, that was like definitely a highlight in my Twitter DMs this year. So yeah, final shout out for that one, Matthew, before we move on to the next session. Shall we take a quick break and come back with our top five holiday games?
Yeah, and this isn't one of the doorbell breaks.
Welcome back to the podcast. So in this section, we're going to talk a bit about our top five holiday games. I guess you'd say they're games that make us think of Christmases or Christmases past.
Maybe they conjure up particular memories. Matthew, what's your exact definition for this?
I went for games that I played at Christmas, and so have a festive association rather than necessarily games I got for Christmas when I was a kid. The ones I got aren't at all Christmassy. For a long period of time, every Christmas, I would get a point and click adventure or the point and click adventure game of the moment.
There were a lot of Christmases where I got Discworld, and then Discworld 2, and then Discworld Noir, and they are not Christmassy games at all. I don't think of them in that way. Where the ones that I've drilled in on, I either played them at Christmas, or I played them at Christmas and they had a Christmas vibe, the double whammy.
You weren't like, thanks mum, you got me The Dig, for example. That didn't happen.
Yeah.
I was like, you know there's that video at the end, 64Kid?
Yeah.
I don't know 64!
There's a video of me somewhere going, The Dig!
Amazing.
And it was like, oh my god, you The Dig, kid?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, I was like, kid, you lost your shit over The Dig, and then didn't understand any of it because I was 10.
I'm so glad I made that joke now. You went much further with that than I could ever have anticipated, which is really the magic of this podcast, isn't it? Okay, good.
Why don't you start with your number five then, Matthew?
My number five is the, I'd say not festive, it's the room series. The puzzle games where you interact with puzzle boxes in various rooms, thus the room. They're quite gothic, you know, they've got a bit of like, Lovecrafty vibe to them.
These rooms are often in sort of darkened mansions. There is a little bit of Christmas gothic to that, perhaps. Dark Spooky House comes with, you know, connotations of Scrooge and Dickens and there's a little bit of it, but mainly it's because I played them at Christmas and the cadence of the release, like they were always coming out, you know, a year apart until they became a little bit more ambitious and that broke out.
So for a good three Christmases in a row, there was always a new The Room game to play at Christmas, a four to five hour experience on an iPad. Sometimes when you're doing a big family Christmas, you don't have time to just go and sit in a room and be anti-social and play like 50 hours of the game. Sometimes you're stealing half an hour here or there and actually the The Room games fit a more social Christmas, it was the game I could play.
And yeah, just very beautifully made, very polished things, very happy memories of tapping away through Christmas. I hope they make another of these, I don't really know what they're up to since the... Is it three or four?
I think there's four of them now.
The VR1 as well, right?
Yeah, and the VR1. But since then, it's not sure what these guys are up to.
Okay, interesting. Yeah, I think one thing I noticed is that I was picking games that were all from ten years ago or more. Because when we talked about Lonely Man Christmas in a recent episode, I can't remember which one that was.
But that concept is very real, and it means that in my adult life before I was in a long-term relationship, I was definitely spending my Christmas days at least two to three hours while waiting for a dinner to be produced to go through these games. So that's definitely what prompted my number five, which is Red Dead Redemption's Undead Nightmare DLC. And I picked this because I finished Red Dead Redemption early in 2010, and I remember Christmas 2010.
And I came back to this with the mindset of like, this is like a Christmas special where all the characters come back, but something wacky happens. And so, you know, basically, Undead Nightmare is the zombie DLC for Red Dead Redemption. So it kind of changes the mechanics.
So the towns become these locations that can be taken over and like permanently lost to the undead if you don't go and like protect them basically. And then there are all these like monsters that pop up. There's like Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse dotted around for you to collect and then like a unicorn you get at the end of it as well.
Just really kind of fun like mounts basically like really creative, weird Rockstar stuff and zombie versions of the wildlife are really far reaching. You know, it's basically like the sort of Ballad of Gay Tony or like Lost and Damned equivalent to Red Dead Redemption back when Rockstar was big on the single player DLC, which doesn't it doesn't appear to be part of what it does now. So yeah, I think it also just memories of like being chased by zombie bears in the snow in like, while looking for like, I think the death horse is up in like the snowy mountain.
So you just see death kind of like going around. Oh, there's like, there's a yeti up there as well. That's pretty cool.
It's just just memories of pottering around that snowy area and just lots of like weird stuff happening. Yeah, you can you can. But it's a bit where you confront him in the story as well.
He just starts crying about how he's being like, chased by poachers or something like it's just good.
Then you skin him and turn him into a legendary hat.
Very good, Matthew. So what's your number four?
My number four is Twilight Princess, a game which came out quite close to Christmas with the launch of the Wii. Has a very autumnal slash wintry look to it and atmosphere. It's set in a kind of decaying, dying world, in Twilight's sort of period.
It just fits the kind of nights were getting longer, it was getting colder outside, nestling down with this thing was was a real treat. You know, specifically it has one of the great, snowy, weird levels which is the sort of Yetis house where you go there and there's some really, really bad, bad vibes there and you start solving mysteries to work out what's going on in this creepy house. Maybe if this came out in the summer I wouldn't quite have those associations but it just hit at the perfect time.
Playing this in Bath with the projectile shitting rat behind me, as I've talked many times before, is a very happy early end gamer memory. This was also the last Zelda, I mean, Tears of Kingdom aside, that I didn't really cover in any way. I'd only just joined the mag, Greener review Twilight Princess, so it's one I could just enjoy purely as a punter and get pulled into the hype for it and working on the mag I could still read Greener's review and go, oh holy shit, there's going to be this amazing Zelda game to play at Christmas.
A Zelda at Christmas is such a treat.
Yeah, absolutely. I imagine there will be many people getting through Tears of the Kingdom this year, for example. And that's got snowy bits in it, so you can pretend that's a bit festive, can't you?
That'd work.
Yes, it's got some good snow, it's got some nice jingly, wintery music in it.
Lots of nice things in that game, so I'll try my best to be diplomatic.
God, that's your equivalent of people loving. Zelda 2 is the kingdom. Lots of nice things in that game.
Meaningless words. Okay, so the matter before is the Beatles Rock Band. This did come out close to Christmas in 2009, and it is like, actually, the more you think about it, the more it seems ridiculous that they let this disappear so quickly.
It must have been such a nightmare to pull it together. It could only have happened in that one moment when rhythm action games were absolutely enormous, and they could get the Beatles music and likenesses and all this amazing visual iconography pushed into this game with this tour of their history as a band, basically forming the crux of their quote-unquote, I don't know, story mode or whatever it is, the main way you play through the game, the main order of the songs. Meanwhile, it just has these really nice avatars of the four of them just doing their thing, basically, and across the different areas and reflecting their styles and the time, and just obviously made with absolute love, you know?
I think I just think of the Beatles as a Christmas thing as well, because I think this game did do that because we did get out for that Christmas. My mum played it. I definitely mentioned this before.
She just couldn't do it to try playing like she's leaving home and she didn't understand yet to like press the button and push down the little sort of like string thing, the little string button. She didn't understand he had to press both and she got really angry, but she said, I'm not doing it anymore. She put it down and then walked off and then I was just kind of playing it by myself, but it was a bit more tragic.
We ruined Christmas.
I ruined Christmas, Ringo ruined Christmas, we all did, really. But nonetheless, a very, very nice game, but weirdly I just, I think maybe it's because I've been watching that Peter Jackson documentary as well. My little brothers told me, if you put on another episode of that, when you come down this Christmas, you'll get, you have to, you just have to fucking leave, like you cannot stay.
Because he's just sick of like, he came in last time with his like Nintendo Switch, and he was just, and he just said, oh, not this again. And I kind of walked out and I was like, that's alright, if I put justified on this year or something like that. But yeah, because what everyone thinks of at Christmas is justified, a bit of Timothy Oliphant in a cowboy hat, but yeah.
Beatles Rock Band.
The only thing that can make Beatles Rock Band any better is if they released Michael Lindsay Hogg DLC. And you just have a fifth player just kind of like awkwardly walking around the rest of the band members trying to hurry them along to something.
Yeah. You have like you have the microphone and as Michael Lindsay Hogg, you have to say his slightly awkward, oh, well, we'll have another go at filming that now. And yeah, try it like this.
And yes, I think if we wait two more days, then we're not gonna have enough time to finish the special.
You have to read out those bits that he says in the documentary and at the end of the song a big yes, you have to say the lines karaoke style, except you're not singing them.
You're just giving instructions and the songs are 60 minutes long and it's really, really good. Yeah. Like Beelzebub band though, like the idea that something that that special is lost to time is is quite is very sad.
This is not X-Men Origins Wolverine. You know what I mean? It's a different different level of licensed game.
Did you ever have any kind of interaction with this one?
Yeah, I think we played a bit of it in the fight. I think Rich had it or Rich brought it home. I was a bit of a latecomer to the Beatles.
I hadn't listened to a lot of them. So when this came out, everyone was just flexing their natural Beatles knowledge, but it seems everyone had just has as a human being and for some reason I didn't. Now I feel if it came out, I'd be better suited.
You know, I know a few more of the songs and I have a few more opinions on it. So, yeah, I missed out a little bit on Beatles rock band mania.
Yeah, fair, fair. I think that's it's like it was one of those things where I think it actually showed that maybe not all generations had as much interest in the Beatles as the people who made the game assumed that we were harmonics assumed because I think it sold modestly, I think, you know.
Do you like the new Beatles song?
I've not listened to it actually. I just I can't find it.
I like it. I listen to I've listened to it quite a bit.
Didn't you say the music video is quite cursed?
Oh, the music video is awful because it's like old Paul McCartney and old Ringo with like CG like AI versions of Lennon and Harrison kind of stitched in playing together, except it's Ringo and Paul are playing as if, you know, like they were just playing in a session, like they're in like a music studio. And John Lennon is just like larking about, just look cut from something else. The superimposing of Paul McCartney on any image instantly puts me in Destiny mindset.
It's got a little bit of that. Imagine the Destiny music video, except John Lennon is also there.
Have we talked about, have I told you about the level in Destiny 2 that had a secret room where that song is playing and there's enemies are dancing to it? Yeah, that's good. That's a funny, I don't think, I think that's like been been vaulted now in the old Destiny, you know, content archives, but yeah.
Did you see that they announced today that they're doing that Spinal Tap sequel?
They're so fucking old though.
Yeah, but they are, but it's got like loads of people. It's got like Paul McCartney and people of that Elton John and people of that Ilkin. But I think it's a spoof of Martin Scorsese's The Last Waltz.
Oh, right.
It's like what happens if they did one last concert with all their celebrity friends? I think that's going to and actually I was like, oh, I could be into that. That could work as a thing.
Yeah.
Because The Last Waltz is a very specific, like cultural artifacts that you can riff on. So, yeah. Yeah.
So, so I'm intrigued.
So Spinal Tap and The Dial of Destiny coming soon, basically. Okay, good. So, what's your number three, Matthew?
Should we have a doorbell?
Hello, this is Catherine Castle, Editor-in-Chief of PC gaming website Rock Paper Shotgun and also Matthew's wife. My game of the year is Shadow Gambit, The Cursed Crew, which is the excellent top-down tactical stealth game from the now sadly disbanded Design Withers Me Me Me games. In what is now their final game, you play as a bunch of undead pirates who must save their home from the evil Inquisition.
You'll do that by murdering, stabbing, stuffing people into bushes, possessing their souls, sniping them from afar and possibly also firing them out of a cannon. Or doing all those things at once. It's extremely good fun and my favourite game of 2023.
Goodbye.
Oh, that was good.
Oh yeah, great stuff.
Anyway, my number three, Spider-Man Miles Morales.
I should have put this one too.
It's a modern Christmas classic, shorter campaign, which is delightful in its own right, because you can get through it in like 10, 12 hours, but set in New York at Christmas, but gives it a proper snowy Christmas makeover. It looks and feels very different to the original Spider-Man game. Great start where you're, I think, is it Rhino that you're fighting?
And you're kind of chasing him and he pulls you through a very festive shopping centre, a shopping mall full of all the Christmas decorations and you're tearing it up. All of its other qualities, the strength of Miles Morales and the kind of warmth of all the family moments, that's all great, but the Christmas energy and releasing this at Christmas time alongside a new console, just a perfect touch, really.
Yep. So I haven't played this for the first time recently in October, which is maybe the wrong time to play it, but you know, I still got me in the mood for that.
I like that they've got a Yellow Jackets Jasmine Savoy Brown in this, also seen in Scream, and they used her likeness. It's a shame the character's arc doesn't really quite land, but the overall festive feel of the game is definitely there, and it's a pretty successful little sort of mini campaign. I think I agree with your assertion, Matthew, that if they did smaller Spider-Man games in between the larger ones, that would actually work for me.
Like I could play another one in like a couple of years or three years or something like that, you know, just be like, yep, like another Mars-focused game that would suit me. His world is just as compelling as Peter's, just you get a bit more focus, it's just his game, don't you? So yeah, very, very good.
Okay, cool. So my number three is Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2, that festive classic. Definitely talked about this before, but lost my mind a little bit in Christmas 2010.
It was a weird year. A lot happened that year. I was like my sort of coming of age year, which sounds preposterous, but was true.
At the end of it, I was so knackered that I just sat and played The Force Unleashed 2 three times in a row. Finished it three times in one day. Very strange day.
Started at 8 a.m. left my flat at like 8 p.m. or something to go to this train station and then like travel to see my parents at Christmas.
I will always remember the repeated levels, level design in this game, because they just didn't have more than two years to finish it, so it was a very, very rushed sequel. And then I always remember the cool little twist where you could pick the dark side ending and then like an evil clone of your main character would pop up and stab your guy. That was pretty cool.
That was good. There's an arbitrary Yoda encounter in this as well. And some like some NAF hallucinatory sequences, because it was like the 360 age.
So yeah, it actually like looked a bit nicer. The combat was slightly better, but they just didn't have enough time to build the game as sort of like, I guess like widen scope as the original Force Unleashed. But I will always associate this with Christmas for whatever reason.
So there is Matthew.
So the Christmas I had a breakdown playing the Force Unleashed 2.
That's the most me thing I could possibly say on this podcast.
Really?
What's your number two?
My number two is Last Window, the sequel to Hotel Dusk actually came out a little bit before Christmas. I had a memory of playing this at Christmas the year it first came out, but that isn't true. I actually reviewed this.
Must have been the August bank holiday would have been when I was down at the coast. And so it was baking hot and I was playing this game about a load of people being sad around Christmas. But it is set in the run up and aftermath of Christmas, set in a apartment building, which everyone is being evicted from because they're about to sell the building.
And you have, you know, just over a week to solve the final mystery of the Cape West Apartments. It's just a great, great depiction of Christmas this game and being a bit lonely at Christmas. If you're going to do Lonely Boy Gamer Christmas or whatever we called it, what did we call it?
Lonely Man.
I think Lonely Man Christmas was pretty much it.
If you're going to do a Lonely Man Christmas and just mainline the game, it may as well be about a guy having a Lonely Man Christmas of his own.
He's actually in command of his space, Matthew, I think you're right.
Not really, because he's being evicted. Yes, but Christmas Day itself, everyone gathers in the cafeteria at the bottom of this building. There's a diner, restaurants, and you just share Christmas Day with just the few weirdos who are there.
And it's probably not even your favorite characters in this game. And it's just the idea of this day can bring people together. And that's a bit schmaltzy and sentimental.
I am quite a schmaltzy and sentimental person. You play a game of pool to try and win a better Christmas dinner, get to talk to the nice waitress. And yeah, I think it's one of the more sophisticated depictions of like the moments that do happen in life where you just end up having a weird connection with people, you know, just have happenstance of you happen to be in a place together.
And that does happen. And they often those moments can stick.
Yeah, I agree. So I thought there's more for you to say after that.
No, no.
Sticks sounded like it had like a semi-colon afterwards or something.
No, it's perfect time for a ding-dong.
Yeah, a ding-dong.
And I was really sad that Christmas. Ding-dong. Here's why I love XO Primal.
Oh, great. So yes, I do agree. I've had those Christmases myself.
I bet you're really looking forward to Alexander Payne's The Holdovers, aren't you, Matthew? That looks like you'll be there saying this should win best picture, not Saltburn. Saltburn's not going to win best picture anyway.
Saltburn, because we haven't talked about it, very hollow, but great fun.
Yes, exactly. That is the take, I think. Although I don't think there is a bad take on Saltburn.
I get the people who hate it and I get the people who love it. I really enjoyed it.
Oh, it's just so entertaining.
Yeah. You can't look at all of that and be like, I'm having a bad time. Surely, no one can think that, it's just, yeah.
I think the entertainment factor is off the charts in that one. Yeah, I thought it was good. I'm glad you enjoyed it too.
Yeah. Okay, cool. So we're on to my number two.
Yes, Final Fantasy VII. So this was Christmas Day 2003. I had upset my parents because I had failed to participate in a Christmas, some kind of weird Christmas game my mum had conceived and I'd ruined it apparently by finding one of my gifts before I was supposed to.
My parents were quite big on like some kind of like escape room style puzzles in order to like actually get to my gifts when I was kind of like, it's 6:45 a.m. I'm up, let me unwrap these things immediately so I could start playing like with this Power Rangers toy or whatever, that was kind of more my mentality. So did that, got sent to my room for several hours.
In that time, I watched the death of Aerith and then went into the mountains afterwards for some snowboarding and the snowy sort of like surrounds of what Matthew is about to play in Final Fantasy VII. That is what reminds me of Christmas Day. It's just weirdly, not quite festive, but it's just, I think being in that particular setting does stick with you.
And it's quite a large portion of the game, quite a significant area of the game. So yeah, sticks with me after all this time. And maybe like has added to the mythology in my head of why Final Fantasy VII is a little bit special.
So yeah, what's the number one, Matthew?
Maybe I'll say Final Fantasy, the beginning of this too for Christmas Day.
Yeah, I mean, what will you actually be playing on Christmas Day this year, do you think?
Probably nothing.
Yes, same.
I'm hoping for Mario RPG for Christmas.
I've asked for that too.
So I might play a little bit of that.
You'll realize that all of the Gino heads were right all along, Matthew. That's gonna be like your narrative going into 2024.
Gino taught me the real meaning of Christmas.
Yeah, I can see the op-ed now on GamesRadar.
And he was never in the Smash Brothers, it's not fair.
My number one is the Gino 3, Fable 2. This isn't like a wintery game for the most part. It opens in winter, but that opening has had a big effect on me and sort of sticks in my head and sort of defines the flavor of that game.
You know, this very sort of Dickensian rundown, sort of hovel that you kind of crawl out of at the start and you're these two filthy urchins who are sort of begging on the street and get a shot at an escape from this life. Spoiler alert, it doesn't work out and sort of sets you on a big path for vengeance. But the kind of fairy tale British take on the RPG just feels inherently Christmassy to me.
This feels like a BBC Christmas special. It has that kind of humor, that slightly kind of ramshackle charm. This isn't an HBO fantasy, it's a more local television level.
Just big enough to like enjoy over a Christmas holiday, but not so big to be like completely life consuming. Yeah, just a deep Christmas energy that I can't quite put my finger on. But when I think of Christmas, I do think of this game.
I think I agree with that because I do remember that opening very vividly. It does have a bit of the old something that would be on BBC One at 5pm kind of energy to it. You know what I mean?
Like that sort of like ride down to Zoey Wanamaker in the, you know, like narrating in the menus.
So it's kind of completely sincere, which is part of it. Very charming game.
Yeah, exactly. It's like maybe the, you know, maybe sort of like the prison, the spire area of the Fable is less festive, but like the rest of it certainly.
But you need a little bit of peril. That's like Boxing Day, isn't it, where you're like, oh god, I've got to pay the price now for all the fun I was having.
Yeah, I think I agree that like there's something fundamentally British and therefore autumnal about Fable as a series, like it, you know, and then like the sort of fantasy level of it is modulated. So it feels like a good fit for, yeah, like at this kind of like time of year in Britain for whatever reason. And Fable pretty much always released at Christmas as well, right?
So that kind of.
Yeah. And it's the difference between like you could take this world in a more like Shrek kind of direction, which is very like summery, very Californian, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But it doesn't have that. So it can only be played at Christmas. The idea of playing this game in like June seems perverse.
The idea of playground games sort of like making putting the same resources into a Shrek game does fascinate me, though, what a cursed artifact that would be. So OK, so yes, my number one is very predictable, it's Bully, the ultimate holiday game. And I've discussed this very recently because someone asked us about holiday games and I answered Bully, so I am repeating myself, I do apologize.
But the magic of this game is definitely the transition of the seasons, just stand out. And the winter is just represented so well, snowball fights and like snowmen, you can sort of break and then like all the kids in the school start wearing winter wear. And the vibe of the town changes.
So it just feels like a wintery town in real life in a way that games never really depict because which games are set in a small New England town with a wintery vibe. It's such a precise feeling and it's so precise that it feels like it was inspired by something that one or several of the developers might have gone through like, oh, I remember that about this year. They wanted to capture what it feels like to go to the fun fair at this time of year or just, you know, doing yourself paper round and like the feeling of getting to the end of the year and like, I think, I think you can put Jimmy the main character can wear like a little Christmas jumper as well.
It's just just the idea of them leaning into the the feeling of the setting in this quite sincere way. That's the thing with Bully. It's it's very sincere for a Rockstar game, like the kids are like motor mouth in the way that all Rockstar protagonists and antagonists are.
But the actual like, but they are kids and the game doesn't forget that. And it does what it does want to make it feel like some moments of your life are as special as they feel to a kid when they happened. And I think Christmas is one of those.
So Bully really is like the ultimate Christmas game, in my opinion. Then when the snow disappears and it becomes spring, it's actually quite sad because you get kind of back to school sort of vibes, but yeah, very good. And yeah, yeah.
Saltburn DLC when Jimmy goes home with preppy boy. Mini game we get to lick a plug hole.
Oh, gosh, that bit of the film.
There are a couple of scenes in this. It wasn't a collective disgust, but I could see people in the cinema kind of, you know, looking down the line of chairs a little bit in kind of, we're all seeing this, right? This is quite weird.
Because I always go to the little theatre. No matter what film you're seeing, unless it's like Titan, you will always see like an elderly couple there or like a couple of elderly people who are like friends. Just they're thinking, what does an elderly couple at the front think of like that scene or like some of the other sexual content in that film?
You know what I mean? Like, yeah.
There was quite an older lady in the cinema with us who had one of those audio description headsets on. It was turned up so loud, you could hear it occasionally. And it was kind of, he is in the bathtub, he leans down towards the blockhole and there are slurping noises.
That is so funny. That's amazing. What a great way to experience that film, hearing that in the background.
Okay. Those are the gamers, Matthew. Is it time for one more Ding Dong?
It is, and seeing us out is friend of the show and creator of Videoverse, Lucy Blundell.
Hey, Samuel and Matthew. Thank you so much for inviting me back to talk about my favourite game of the year. So I haven't actually played as much as I usually do this year because I launched Videoverse and life's been kind of hectic leading up to that and after that.
I'm about halfway through Tears of the Kingdom and whilst I'm really enjoying it, I still feel like in my heart I have to give my game of the year to A Space for the Unbound. A Space for the Unbound is a heartfelt narrative adventure set in 90s Indonesia where you follow two high school sweethearts at the end of their days at school. But there's loads of supernatural elements, things don't seem quite right, and it launches you into this mystery full of twists and turns.
It's already been nominated for some indie awards and even a Games for Impact at the Game Awards, so it's really nice to see that it's receiving the wide recognition that it deserves. It also has a retro pixel art aesthetic and a beautifully chill soundtrack, so it's really my jam. I absolutely love playing it.
It shows some of the darker parts of ourselves and what happens when we can't safely express ourselves. And that just moved me personally. It definitely touches the human heart and I think that's what a lot of good indie games can do.
So please check it out and have a great winter break, everyone. Thank you.
Oh, great take. Fantastic take. One of the best takes I've heard this year.
Okay, Matthew, should we take one more quick break and come back with some Xmas Mailbag content?
Welcome back to the podcast, this is the final section where we're gonna go through some Christmas mailbag entries from our listeners. Basically, what we asked was, were some memorable things that happened at Christmas related to games that had occurred to our listeners. There was a little Discord thread for it, and yeah, we've got a bit of content in there.
Some of it's fun, some of it's just kind of like, this thing happened once, and you know, you'll probably have an all right time at the end of it. So as ever, taking side swipes at our lovely listeners.
I like to think this is like the end of Christmas Day, where you've got the meat sweats from Christmas dinner. You're still wearing a paper hat, and all the grease from your head has made it go a bit translucent.
Yeah, very much so, yeah.
This is very much the translucent paper hat of The Back Page Christmas Include.
This is from Ryan Plugs. When I was six, I was a big Toy Story guy, and an even bigger Mega Drive guy. That Christmas, all I wanted, unsurprisingly, was the Toy Story game for my Mega Drive.
Christmas came, and as I unwrapped my gifts, something wasn't adding up. I got the Toy Story game, but in a big PC box. Santa had bought the wrong version.
A Toy Story mouse mat that my mom said she thought was a post-striker to hang on my wall. My dumb six-year-old self hadn't caught on as to what was actually happening until the final gift was unveiled. A PC!
Suddenly the PC game and mouse mat made sense. I was over the moon for all of ten seconds when my dad said, jokingly, and now you've got this, we can get rid of your Mega Drive. According to my parents, I cried for an hour solid at the very suggestion.
Yeah, I think you should have had your PC and your Mega Drive taken off of you after that. I'd be like, we've raised a fucking loser. And just really put you in your place.
That was quite sweet until the end. And then it turned into like, I don't know, something else, but you know.
You don't need to hate yourself for this. You know, we all do dumb things when we're kids. I like the idea of the mom doing a bit about a mouse map being a poster.
Sometimes I think that parents think that like, they've suffered to get you the gifts. So they need to have some fun. Do you know what I mean?
Like there's a bit of that goes on. Like we paid the price. We're gonna like piss you off a little bit for a laugh.
Or it's like, we know that you're gonna be happy. Like we're about to do this thing, which is gonna blow your mind. So this is actually like a rare moment.
We can bully you a bit. Like normally you can't do that to a kid, but it's like we can grind you down, confident in the knowledge that we're gonna lift you so far back up that you won't even remember that bit.
Yeah, except Ryan Plugs did remember that bit and brought it up here.
So they did a real number on you.
Yeah, they did. You were like, oh, don't take the dolphin off of me.
I remember the same thing with my brother. Alex hates it when I talk about this on the podcast. When he got his PS2 and wept massively at it.
That's the bit he hates. But the theater of giving it to him and like giving him official PlayStation magazine and there being this, like that's how he got the magazine first to unwrap and there was this beat of like, oh, but I don't have what this thing's about, you know? So I do like that.
Like I hope one day I can have kids purely because I want to fuck with them on Christmas day. Really take them around the houses.
I think that's a good, yeah. Lots of like misdirection in their gifts, basically, yeah. Until the truth emerges that it's just a bag of oranges.
It just builds up, like the lower someone can feel, the more ecstatic they're gonna feel when they get the thing they want.
Yeah, I do, I gotta say nothing was ever better than when I unwrapped that PS2 in 2001. That was like, just remember seeing the blue box and being like, oh, fuck, my life's about to change. And that being what I really thought.
And it did a little bit, I guess, because I was about to have The Matrix on DVD, as established in the 2001 episode. Also, Matthew, if you'd have been told by your parent, and now you've got this, we can get rid of your Megadrive, you'd have been like, they're 12 years old, go right ahead, I like Mario, fuck you. That would have been like your vibe, I think.
Okay, I'll read out this next one then. I was an incredibly spoiled only child who was given a Dreamcast for Christmas in 1999, commiserations, that's me saying that. Frack it's absolutely ridiculous, which was lovely, except I also had the flu.
So after a very exciting day of playing Soul Calibur, most of Christmas, my main memory of that festive season is being played by feverish nightmares in which I, dressed as Kilik, big stick and all, was forced to fight my father over and over again in the Takamatsu stage with Sigmund Freud, an unlockable character in that game. Oh shit, I also just remembered a much better story. As a little stocking fellow in 2006, my mum got me a calendar with some World War II Spitfires on it, which was very strange as I had never expressed any interest in or about World War II or aviation or any of it.
When I asked her why she got me it, she said it was because I liked the Nintendo Wii so much.
That's really good.
So written down, that looks like Wii, just to be clear there.
Yeah.
That is so funny.
It looks like Wii.
That's really good.
Nothing more to add there, Matthew. That's really good. Soul Calibur, instead of Banger.
I had a great time playing that recently. Do you want to read the next one?
This is from Sam. The first console I ever got was a Christmas present from my dad. He got me a SNES with Street Fighter 2 Turbo and NBA Jam.
I was an only child and he refused to play the largely multiplayer slash arcade focused games with me as he claimed video games gave him headaches, which is why I think he only ever got me one controller and refused to buy others for future Christmas or birthdays. So he couldn't be brought to him.
There is this sort of Christmas, parents treat it as you got one token to spend with me while I would engage with you this Christmas. My parents will still talk about the times they built a big Lego set for me on Christmas Day as if it was a massive chore that ate into their lives. Remember that year we built you the big blue spaceship and it's like, why do you still remember this?
Why do you still begrudge this?
That was Kev's precious oboe time.
Yeah. He was there just reading about this Queen point and click adventure game that he couldn't play, angry about it. It was a very strange situation.
But parents are a bit like that, I think. They can begrudge it as they were. Thank you for your entry.
I like that letter. It paints a very, in not many words, a very vivid picture of your dad that I claimed they gave him headaches. Oh, I just can't, son, they just give it, it gives me headaches.
Claimed is really good. Claimed just got big, sort of like, almost Christmas means it wasn't Christmas, allegation energy to it.
Also, that, that, like, this console, how did you know this console gave you headaches? You just gave it to them, you know?
Yeah, my dad-
This doesn't hold up at all. Where's Phoenix Wright when you need him?
Yeah. Okay, so I'll read out this next one. Some festive vegetable tart, that's not her real name, but you know, there it is.
My mum never really bought me video game related presents, and she didn't think they were good presents. One year she did buy me Merlin Season 1 Part 1 on DVD, and then Merlin Season 4 Part 2 on DVD, so that was helpful, and last year she separated the multi-pack of socks and gave me and my sister one pair each, because more than one pair was too much of a big gift for a stocking filler. Great stuff there.
The old, like, parts of, like, a DVD box set, where they do, like, Lost, Season 1 Part 1, what a fucking, like, scam that was. They were like, yeah, that was, the noughties were a rough man, millennials have seen some shit, you know?
One of the worst things they ever bought was on eBay, when Love Film shut down the rental service, they started selling off crates of ex-rental DVDs, but it was like a lucky dip. It was like ten quid, and you'd get, you know, a hundred DVDs, but you didn't know what they were gonna be.
Yeah.
And so I bought two boxes of this stuff, and it was all like season five of Grey's Anatomy just three, and then a Top Gear DVD, and bonus features DVD of a two DVD box, so it was such a cursed collection of shit. We still got it, we never know what to do. It's like something Catherine brings up a lot, whenever there's talks of like, there's too much shit in the house, how quickly she remembers the box of assorted random Grey's Anatomy DVDs.
Yeah, I don't blame her, of all the things in that house, those could go, I think. But they are like a good lesson about hubris, I guess, you know what I mean?
If we ever do get round to doing the live podcast, I will bring that box along, and I will give every attendee a DVD out of my box.
Great, well that's an incentive. I'd like to try that early next year, if you've got the energy Matthew, try and do the live show, but we could talk about that off air. Yeah.
Okay, so, do you want to read out this next one?
I'm pretty sure it was Christmas of 2001, just a few days prior to the big day I had visited the local Dixons with my dad, with the hopes of picking up Silent Hill 2. I had to get my dad to get it as I was underage, 14 I think. But it was the two-disc special edition and I was over the moon.
Cue me playing it all the way up to Christmas, then on the 25th opening all my Christmas presents and then going back up to my room to play some more Silent Hill 2. I can fondly remember, after Christmas dinner that year, doing the bit where you have to road James across Toluca Lake, spending way too long with him rowing that tiny boat, hardly seeing anything and properly creeping myself out. Ah, memories.
That's from Beatomax Bandit.
That's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Very nice.
Lovely stuff there.
A nice, creepy Christmas.
Yeah, I've discussed that I play Silent Hill 2 at Christmas. This is where OboHead comes from, so we don't need to re-litigate that. OboHead's come up enough this year.
Okay, next one's from Koig. As a kid, I would cut out ads or snippets from the Argos catalogue and pin them on the Eccretion notice board as an obnoxious directive to my parents to buy me this exact thing for Xmas. I recall cutting out a preview of Pez from the Free Metro newspaper as part of a concerted strategy to get a PS2 for Christmas.
I would reinforce this by making barely legible photocopies of said snippets in the fax machine and placing them in various spots around the house as a further reminder. It wasn't a foolproof strategy, but this time my months-long campaign beat my hard-working salt-of-the-earth parents into submission and for Xmas 2001 I got a PS2 with GTA 3 and Pez. This remains a moment of such joy and wonder I fear I will be chasing that high forever, interested to know what strategies the lads slash rest of the Discord adopted to get their gamey presence of choice each year.
Well, I will say in response to this, I did because my parents, my mum had like a thing, like a being a bonnet about Vice City. She just would not let me have Vice City when it was 2002, I was 14 and I'd been given GTA 3 because Kev Roberts was deeply irresponsible as previously established in previous episodes. My mum wasn't delighted about that, but she never took GTA 3 off of me.
But I think by that point, maybe some of the Jack Thompson-esque stuff had started popping up about GTA, so she was maybe more on her radar. I went to the trouble of two pages of A4 about why she should buy me Vice City for Christmas and it did not work, I'll be honest, but they did rent it me from Blockbuster, which was even worse. It was better not to have it, to have a little taste of it, I think.
It had Big Bart trying to get Bonestorm in The Simpsons' energy, I would say. That's why I relate to that episode quite a lot. I don't know what the equivalent of Lee Carvalho's putting challenge I got for Christmas that year, but I don't know, it's probably, what did I get for PS2 that year?
I can't remember, actually, so I'm afraid I don't have a funny answer, but yeah, that was the one thing I remember doing, just to try and like... That was the only time I've ever tried anything like that, to be like, look, it's imperative you get me for this for Christmas, you know, so what about you, Matthew?
Definitely doing the old explaining why something was good or worthwhile, wanting the Discworld Point and Clip games and, oh, you know Terry Pratchett, who writes the books I really like? Well, there's a game and it's really just like a book, it's just like a very fancy book, so you know, it's not like a bad game, it's like a book, which, you know, and you like you like it when I read and being very keen or like reading excerpts of reviews out to parents, I've definitely done that going, oh, they say it's, you know, one of the best games of the year, it'd be really great if we had that game in our house and such clear memories of on Christmas Day, my parents would always put the presents under the tree like at night when we were asleep, so you'd come down and then there'd be all the presents and you'd be looking for.
Like anything I think we're good to go. I think we're good to go. I think we're good to go.
I think we're good to go. I think we're good to go. I think we're good to go.
I think we're good to go. I think we're good to go. I think we're good to go.
I think we're good to go.
I think we're good to go.
Maybe the other Christmas might have the game, maybe Fun Dad would get you a game.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Sometimes my mum would be like, it's time you had some reading related presents and inevitably be like the lamest things. The weirdest thing she got me, that I felt really bad for never engaging with, I was about 11, she got me this book called The Kittens in the Kitchen.
It's clearly for young girls. It came with a cassette and a book. I was like, this feels like the wrong gift.
It made me think, in what world is this better than getting me, I don't know, Alien versus Predator on PC?
Alien versus Predator versus kittens in the kitchen.
But in retrospect, I actually find it quite heartwarming she tries to do something a bit different. I'm a bit like, oh, at least she was giving it a go.
You can't look at a gift horse in the mouth, especially when that horse is your mom.
Or some kittens living in a kitchen.
The weirdest present I ever got was my grandma, my dad's mom got me a make your own wicker. What's that wicker store? It was make your own seagrass store.
I don't know if you know what seagrass is, that very thick, gnarly twine. It was make yourself this small four-legged stool, and you had to weave this horrible twine into the seat of the chair. That just for years became the punchline of, if you need a joke about a bad Christmas present, make your own seagrass stool.
When I was 12, what 12-year-old wants to make a stool? What am I going to do? Make it and then sit on it in the corner where I was inevitably told to go because I was talking too much.
That's quite daft, I've got to say. That'll get into the kitchen. These should be bad Secret Santa gifts, basically.
Okay, good. Next question, then.
This one's short, but it's good. It's not a video game, but one Christmas, I wanted a toy called Screwball Scramble. I instead got Scrabble.
That's from Dithy.
Yep, long time list now. Yep, that is funny and exactly. That's very much in the sort of like Wii World War 2 mould, that one, isn't it?
Just like a fundamental misunderstanding by older people. So very good.
It's what you wanted and you're like, this isn't the chaotic marble game.
Yeah, exactly. I wanted that. I asked for Grand Theft Auto and I got a subscription to Autotrader Magazine.
That's sort of like genre of gift. I think my only Christmas console story was getting a Wii for Christmas in 2006 and Twilight Princess and Rayman Raving Rabbids. Hey, they can't all be winners.
To this day, I'm not sure how I convinced my mum to do that. The main thing missing was the second remote, as all Wii-related hardware was pretty scarce for a while after launch. So the family all playing Wii Sports had to wait.
Though the Wii is probably the console I've played most in local multiplayer, so it worked out. My mum didn't know anything about games. Her total experience before me is apparently playing Pong once in the 70s.
But to her credit, she didn't know anything, so wouldn't waste money buying something game-related unless I'd said I wanted it. That's from Campbell. No real punchline there, but it's a nice little snapshot of their family life.
That's not a judgment.
No, I'm having a great time reading it. Also, weren't some of the games turn-based in the XCOM sense, but couldn't you play bowling one after another, Matthew?
Yeah, yeah, you didn't need multiple remotes for that.
Yeah, that's good. Tennis, obviously, not so much, but yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, good, good. Do you want to read this next one?
This is from Tcozy. I had clearly expressed an interest in video games to my family one year. Unfortunately, they decided I would be joining the handheld revolution and I would receive the underdog console.
No, not the game gear. I unwrapped a barcode battler, the console where all your groceries could become part of the game. I don't remember ever playing it.
The next year I got a PlayStation.
I have no memory of the barcode battler. Did you look this up when you saw this on the thing?
I actually hadn't read through these. I wanted to be surprised by them.
Yeah, the barcode battler is like the most Homer Simpson's car-esque thing you can possibly imagine. Like a really like not good, sort of like the Tiger LCD handheld, but like eight times worse. Not good.
But yeah. Okay.
Imagine what would happen if you used the barcode battler to scan the barcode on the back of Agent 47's head. That would be what a gaming crossover that would be.
That's true. Truthfully, if I'd have been, if I'd someone got me a Game Gear and a Sonic game for Christmas, I would consider that a great gift. You know, like that's, I was definitely more excited by the idea of playing that Master System Sonic game on like a handheld more than any of the Game Boy games in like, you know, the late, in like the mid 90s.
You know what I mean?
So yeah, but there's quite a big gulf between a Game Gear and Sonic and barcode battler and probably a bag of empty soup cans to scan, you know?
Yeah, some Horlicks, you know. Yeah, very good. Okay, next one then.
My main Christmas related gaming memory was from 1997 or maybe 98. After years of our only home console being a NES, my brother and I are unwrapping presents when one of us finds an N64 controller. In my probably faulty memory, there's a very distinct comedic beat as we pause, look at each other, immediately realize the implications and begin tearing through the wrapping on anything that looks big enough to be an N64.
In the end, it was in his pile and we got the console. Two controllers, including a weird chunky looking third party one that he decided to take, very cursed gift that, the old cheapo controller, classic 90s artifact, and Super Mario 64. I think every other console after that was either a communal purchase among the siblings or at least a present that we knew was coming, like the Xbox 360 where our parents bought it on launch day, but we had to live with knowing it was hidden under my bed until Christmas morning.
That's from WithAd. Very enchanting there. You basically were the N64 kids there, WithAd, and yes, very good.
No further thoughts on my part. Matthew, anything?
Oh, just amazing. Shared console, single player game, that's got to be difficult at Christmas.
Yeah, you'd want a bit of a clean divide, wouldn't you?
Two people warring over Mario 64, that could get messy. You've played long enough, it's my go.
There was this kid down the street from me who I always thought was incredibly spoiled because his mum went one year, like, I'm going to get you a PlayStation or an N64, which one do you want? And he just picked PlayStation and got one. And then I just thought, like, that was so different to my situation.
My parents would never give me that power to pick a gift because they always wanted to surprise me, which is nice, but they also didn't have the money some years to do things like that. So, you know what I mean? I mean, like, I was envious of those kids.
Yeah, I had a very charm life, I'm not going to, like, spin a tale of woe or anything, but, you know, even we had friends who seemed to get stuff so easily. I knew this kid in school called Jordan, and after, like, any kind of, like, exam or any kind of minor classroom achievement, he'd get a new SNES game. And after we did our SATs or whatever in, like, junior school, whatever exams you do in, like, year four or whatever it was, he got Mario Paint!
He got Mario Paint for doing those exams and everyone being like, holy shit, he got Mario Paint!
I just imagine that, like, one day he sort of, like, shat his pants during PE and his mum bought him Chrono Trigger or something, you know what I mean, like, just sort of...
His family lived in a pub, Dan, they lived in a pub, so they seemed very interesting because of that. Your house was a whole pub. That seemed wild.
Is the pub still going?
You know, you had co-con... Literally co-contact.
Is the pub still going, to your knowledge?
Yeah, it is. It's the cricketers in Oxford.
Okay, it's not a Wetherspoons, is it?
No, no. Small, small town.
What's the most obscure, sort of, like, game he got on the stairs?
I remember Mario Paint. I think I maybe didn't, I hadn't heard of Mario Paint at that point, and it was just like, Mario's painting? Like, there's a painting in a Mario game?
That's crazy.
Yeah. So you never got, like, Terranigma or something like that, you know, just...
Yeah, I think I only ever got to go around to his house to play once, thinking like, yes, I'm going to get to play all these SNES games, this is going to be the best trip ever. And then they just made us play out in the pub garden. Oh, though, oh, this is, this is niche.
I'll probably cut this out, but I'll tell you, it just popped into my head. When we were in the pub garden, I remember him saying, like, do you want to see something really cool? And I was like, yeah, of course.
He like went just beyond the fence of the garden, and there was an old battered ladder. Right. And he picked up this ladder, and he leant it against a nearby tree, and he was like, climb up this ladder and see what's up there.
And so I climbed up this ladder, and at the top of the trunk, where the branches come out, you know, like the kind of nook of the tree, it was full of Coca-Cola bottle tops, just hundreds of the things. And I remember thinking like, that's amazing.
Like, wow, what a thing.
He's collected all these bottle caps in this tree. I was, yeah.
Wow, very bizarre. Are you saving them for some kind of Fallout-esque apocalypse, maybe?
That's the thing. In Fallout, that kid would have been, like, rich.
Yeah. Oh, did you see the Vanity Fair pictures of Fallout, the TV show, by the way? I thought they were pretty good.
I thought they were pretty good.
Yeah. It's her from Yellow Jackets.
Ella Purnell, yeah.
Yeah.
And Carl McLaughlin plays her dad. He's, I guess, like the Liam Neeson-esque character in that, but yeah, I thought they looked really good. Bit of Walton Goggins in there as well.
It always makes the TV show slightly better.
Love a bit of the gogs.
Have you seen Justified City Primeval yet, by the way?
I haven't, no.
Oh, it's really good. I definitely, yeah, yeah. Let me know what you think of that when you do watch it.
It's a sharp little mini-series that I had a very good time watching it. Okay, next one then. Is it your turn?
It is your turn, isn't it?
It can't be any worse than my ball cap story.
You've got to keep that in there now for the context.
In 2004, I was most eagerly anticipating GTA San Andreas. I was 15 and that was the age my parents deemed it okay for me to play an 18-rated game. Up to that point, I had only played GTA 3 and Vice City at friends houses and was supremely jealous that I couldn't play it.
So my hype levels were through the roof for San Andreas and Christmas Day. I remember going to the cinema on Christmas Eve with my family and a trailer for San Andreas was shown before the film. I said out loud that I can't wait to play that tomorrow.
No one said anything, so I had nothing to worry about. Come Christmas Day and I open what looks like a game sized gift to be presented with Golden Eye Rogue Agent. This was a big no from me dog, but I suppressed my annoyance so as to not seem ungrateful.
I did eventually buy San Andreas later in the week using my Xmas money, but then a few weeks later I asked my mum why she hadn't bought me San Andreas. What she said had happened was that when she went to HMV, apparently unaware that other shops sold games, she had forgotten to take my list with her but remembered the game I wanted began with a G. Asking a shop assistant, she asked what popular game that year everyone was wanting, beginning with G, and they told her it must be GoldenEye Rogue Agent.
In reality, I think they had lots of stock in they needed to get rid of. A very disappointing Christmas morning in 2004. That's from Angry Curt.
That's great stuff that is. That's got everything that one. It's got, that's again like the very, that's why the bonestorm situation in The Simpsons is so relatable.
This was your Necar Valle's putting challenge GoldenEye Rogue Agent.
Oh yeah, it must be GoldenEye Rogue Agent.
I guess as well, like maybe the shop assistant thought if you're buying it for like a kid, then it's probably not appropriate. So you'd probably want to suggest something that was legally appropriate, you know?
Yeah.
So maybe it's a bit of that, but probably.
I love the brazen announcement of like, oh yes, that's what I'll be playing tomorrow when I unwrap it.
Yeah, exactly.
I anticipate that nothing shall get in my way when I unwrap it. I unwrap my copy of GTA San Andreas. Very good.
And the parents are thinking, oh, that's weird. This isn't a trailer for GoldenEye Rogue Agents.
Oh, that's so good.
Oh dear. Luckily Kurt would, I think Kurt was a big, like, everything or nothing 007 guy. He's brought that up in the Discord a few times and he's never happy when I slag that off.
I wasn't a fan.
A quick Christmas Day point of order, just him saying a very disappointing Christmas morning. Are you a morning unwrappers or evening unwrappers?
Oh, morning. Evening is like a rich person's thing, isn't it, like you go to church and then come back and you go to church, do something boring for two hours, come back and then unwrap the gifts.
That's me and my family burned.
Sorry, is that what your family does?
Yeah, we don't go to church but we open in the afternoon.
I think it is a little bit, is there a little bit of a classified thing there?
It is there.
I don't know. But the thing is that my parents are not working class now, they were working class but they just act like they did when their parents were running Christmas basically. But I don't think that's necessarily, I feel terrible now, I feel awful about that.
No, that's fine. We don't unwrap until the washing up is done after lunch. That's the rule.
I've got that thing now as well where I'm like, I'm like, oh yeah, I'm in my mid-30s, there's no need for me to get massively excited about this, and then I fucking do. I see the pile of gifts.
Every time. Yeah.
I'm like, yeah.
But even though I know I'm getting a load of books, my brain switches into like, I could be reading a new Higashino book right now.
That's the thing, it's like, my mum's like actually, this year they want to go quite all out with Christmas. I think it's because there was like, not to get too into it, but a hell scare in the family. So there's a little bit of like, we'll go all out.
And so I've been like, there's a lot of Amazon wish lists going around for the first time. But I don't find that enormously instructive, because a lot of the bullshit I like can only be obtained on eBay through very dubious sellers, much like your crime fiction, Matthew. You know, you just have to go to some weird places to get it.
But anyway, yeah, we get a lot of these people going, oh, we're not really doing Christmas this year. So don't get us anything. And that's a little bit annoying as someone who likes Christmas, the idea that people are just opting out of it.
The only, because you're an adult, you can't make any day special anymore. You have to like just be miserable all the time.
And like that's just like, oh, yeah, I think, yeah, it's like, well, I'm not opting out. Like I'm still doing, you know, I'm still getting people presents. So I just got like doing it.
And I like getting presents.
Yeah, so I just got fucking Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 on PS5 and I'm having a great time. Thank you very much.
The thing, the big thing I'm trying to shut down at the moment is Catherine's suggestion of like, why is a present to each other? Why do we get some dining room chairs?
And I'm like, I know it's the grown up thing to do, but also, oh my god, please no.
That's like getting a new school uniform for Christmas or something.
It's just, like the little bit of me that's still 15, just couldn't ever forgive me if I went along with that. So I'm like, why don't we just buy loads of games instead?
Can you not just spend some of the Patreon money on some chairs? That's doable, isn't it?
We can just get that. Well, that's the point. We can just get dining room chairs in the spring.
That's just the thing that we need to get for the house.
I agree. Surely, like, Catherine has some, like, I don't know, sort of like, you know, anime bullshit she wants you to buy, like something, some kind of, like...
I think it's because we're both, there's nothing major in either of us needs, so we're sort of struggling to think of anything. So, it probably is sensible, but it's not really a spirit of Christmas. Like getting, it's too close to that seagrass stool for me.
Literally a chair. She knows that I've got chair-based traumas at Christmas.
It's like, I don't want to unwrap anything I have to sit on. That's basically your policy at Christmas. Oh, amazing.
I'm sort of, because I'm going to Japan, I'm going to try and, like, bring back, you know, I've got, like, eight friends, right, we talked about this recently, Matthew. I'm going to, like, bring back each of them, like, some nice gifts from Japan, whether it's, like, some cap steel toys, something like that. Maybe you should suggest to Catherine that she should get into, like, collecting, like, Good Smile Company Figma or something like that, and she could start collecting £100 anime figures or something.
But anything to avoid the chairs.
Yeah.
Okay. We have two more of these then, Matthew. Do you want to read this next one?
When I was in my late thirties, in front of my family and my siblings or sorted partners, my nan, without warning, gifted me a book on dating tips. Always nice to find out people think you need a helping hand. Usually we work off of gift lists, so surprise presents are a rarity in my family.
A double surprise, I guess. That's from personal idea.
What could a book teach you about dating? I mean, I guess this is before the...
Oh, check you out, fucking boast man.
No, I'm the opposite, man. I'm the guy who's like, my self-esteem has been destroyed from 20 minutes on Tinder.
What could a book possibly teach me, Samuel Roberts, about dating?
No, I just mean, a bit of a noughties gift that, do you know what I mean? It's got that kind of energy because you would never be able to do a book on dating tips in like the Tinder age because one page would be like, if they wrote nothing in their profile, don't fucking bother because that's the kind of tips that people give me about dating now. So that wouldn't be in a book, you know what I mean?
Like that's not going to happen.
What was that book about?
Yeah, that book about...
If your nan bought you that, that would be grim.
Yeah, it's also just... I feel like that is such an out day. The nagging thing is like such a sort of like pre social media concept.
People fucking hate that shit now. So it's yeah. But anyway, next up, then last one.
One year, I got three copies of Mario Sonic at the Olympic Games. I'd ask for the new Mario game. Mario Galaxy was quite a downgrade.
And the three video game shaped boxes really got my hopes up each time.
Oh, my God.
So Jamie, that's the worst Christmas ever. Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
That's like, shame me once, shame me once, shame on you. For me twice. Oh, God, it's Mario Sonic again.
I think the other thing is they probably thought, well, he asked for Mario, but this game's got Mario and Sonic in it. So surely by like just quantity of characters, this is a better game.
Also, like just terrible communication between the other present buyers, like our family's very big on, oh, what are you buying, mum? What are you buying so and so? No, just to make sure there's no crossover.
Yeah, that's the thing. Just messaging my brother being like, do not get my mum the number seven gift set from Boots. I've done it.
It's in the bag, you know, that kind of thing.
Yeah, well, three copies of Mario Sonic in the games.
What would be like the modern version of this? Like what would be like the game you would ask for and then the worst scenario of what you would get? I guess it'd be getting like Mario Party, whatever the latest one on Switch was, right?
But even that's like, you know, a Switch game that's kind of fun. What could be the biggest mistake?
I think if you asked like a Final Fantasy game on Switch and you got like that Chocobo GP one, that would be tough.
Yeah, that would be that would be that would be bad. I feel like there's a killer one just just waiting out of reach.
Yeah, we fucked it, Matthew.
Christmas is cancelled. Quick doorbell.
Ding dong. Get us out of here. Ding dong.
I like the idea of someone in the 90s asking for like Jet Set Radio and getting Jet Force Gemini. That's something I hope happened at some point. Yeah, I hope it's someone that happened to them.
I did appreciate you tweeting me by the way when Jet Force Gemini hit the Nintendo Switch Online Store, Matthew. We may have discussed that two episodes in a row now actually. It stays with me.
Maybe I'll play that version over Christmas and report back. Or maybe on the way to Japan, I'll play that and see how it goes. Okay, Matthew, the Holiday Special is done.
It was a bizarre little episode, but I think it was quite jolly in the end. Did you think so?
Oh, I had a great time. I loved everyone's stories. They were fantastic.
Absolutely. And yeah, all I want this year is an improvement on my last Christmas, when we all got COVID and watched the English while shivering under blankets. Hugo Blick's drama The English, which is about basically getting diseases in the early days of America.
That was cursed. A bucket of KFC that got reheated twice, I think, because my mum insisted we ate all of it. That was cursed.
And then, yeah, that was basically what happened. So that was a good time.
By the time people listen to this, you've come back from Japan.
Yeah. Who knows what's happened in that journey? Yeah.
Going to go see a big Gundam statue. Going to go to the ramen museum. That's just in Yokohama.
Then I've got other plans. I have been told I have to do some basic Lost in Translation-esque stuff. So I'll be doing that as well.
But have you been before? Only once on a press trip years ago. That's where my Nogoshi story came from.
That was like 15 years ago, though. So it's been a long time. And that was like two days.
So this is like, yeah, 14, 14 days, Matthew, to fill.
So it's going to be so exciting. I hope you become a side quest in the Yakuza game.
Just like like a broad shouldered lost tourist or something like that. I feel like I'd get beaten up by that Mr. What's his face, though, that big dude. I feel like I've got like a lot of yen for the trip.
What's his name?
Mr. Shakedown.
I think Mr. Shakedown would fuck me up and take my yen. And then I'd be like, oh, no. And then I'd have to ask.
You've got all your yen. You've been talking about how much yen you've got in your. Didn't you tweet it?
I don't think I tweeted it. I got £2,000 worth of yen, though.
And it's like, right. Wait, why don't we listen to this?
Mr. Shakedown. Well, I'll just get, I'll get key to get the money back for me. You know what I mean?
That's what you do, isn't it? You just go up to him and you've got problems and he'll sort it out for you.
So that guy was always a nightmare. He took so much money off me that I never got back.
How many people do you think have only played that game in the Yakuza series? I was thinking about this because on Steam, it's got something like five times the number of reviews of the next closest Yakuza game and it made me think, do you think most people just played that and thought, oh, that was awesome and I feel like I've had my fill now. Do you think people have that experience with Yakuza a bit because there are so many of them?
Yeah, or they played it and went, that's not for me.
Also possible. Plus, it's always like two quid. It's classic, the Yakuza Zero, isn't it?
So, okay, the episode is over. You can not support us on Patreon at the moment, but you will be able to again in January, patreon.com back page pod when we reopen pledges after this month is done. Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I'm at MrBazzill underscore pesto on X and on Blue Sky, I'm MrBazzill pesto no underscore.
Who knows? By then you would have deleted your Blue Sky account, who could really say? I'm Samuel W Roberts on both and the podcast is back page pod on both as well.
So Twitter or Blue Sky, take your pick and we'll share the content either way. Our next episode is the Game of the Year episode, we finally did it. So I look forward to that next week.
No doubt that took fucking four hours to record or something. But yeah, good times. See you later Matthew.
Bye bye.
Wish you a happy Christmas.
Yes, happy holidays. Goodbye.
Bye bye.
