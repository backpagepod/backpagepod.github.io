Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, A Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
I say as ever, Matthew. This has been, it's been two weeks off for you for, you know, completely fine reasons. And how are you doing?
Is it good to be back on the regular episodes?
Oh, lovely to be back. Jeremy and Phil did a lovely job, but it's nice to be back chatting bullshit with you. I think this one should be a nice, healthy dose of bullshit to get us back in the groove.
I think I remember how to do this.
Yeah, which of, out of interest, which of the exotic guns in Destiny that Phil described in hour three of that podcast, did you, were you the most excited about, Matthew? Do you have a preference?
I haven't listened to it yet.
I somehow knew that would be the case.
Is that shitty of me? I'm sorry. I just, I didn't know if I could deal with two and a half hours of Destiny at any point this weekend.
Look, I mean, you know, I thought it was a really good episode, but like definitely accepted that after we made it that maybe this is too inside for like normies to enjoy. Particularly if people have enjoyed like the Kirby list, for example. It's a very different energy.
So yeah, yeah, like I say, Matthew, this is some bullshit. So welcome to the second Games Court episode of 2022. It's been a few months since we did one of these.
Traditionally, these episodes involve the listeners sharing their most dubious secondhand game purchases with us and Judge Matthew Castle deciding whether they live or die for their sins. But Matthew Castle Island is currently being culturally boycotted by the Western world in response to him replacing his entire school curriculum with nine to five play sessions of Jurassic Park Trespasser. So our eyes turn instead to Samuel Roberts Peninsula, where I will be presiding over my own Games Court.
I will be judging purchases on the grounds of taste versus money spent and whatever else takes my fancy. Damn, it's good to be a judge. Matthew wrote a little script for me there.
Thank you for that full-bodied reading of that.
Let me try again. Damn, it's good to be a judge. Listeners will know I've got a kind of sexy Kathleen Turner thing going on with my voice this week.
I'm not entirely sure what it is. I did drink some gin last night, so it might be that. I apologize.
You just suggested to me it was because you ate an egg sandwich.
I just wanted to hide my alcoholism from you.
Because there's nothing more famously abrasive than egg.
It does sort of clag in the throat somewhat.
It does clag, but it doesn't scratch.
Yeah, that's true.
Unless you ate it on a particularly rough artisanal bread.
Sorry, what are you, Columbo, suddenly? Like, what's this?
When it comes to sandwiches, yes, I am sandwich Columbo.
It does clag, but it doesn't scratch. That's like, that should be on your business cards for your sandwich detective agency. So, yes, people will be familiar with the Games Court format at this point.
It has yielded such famous sort of memes as We've Got Ourselves A Pulpin, Matthew Castle classic. I feel a lot of pressure actually to be doing this and preparing for this. These episodes is like preparing for a local theatre production.
It's like, it's basically like role play. Preposterous, that sounds, but it is like that because as people have listened to the previous Games Court episodes will know, we have like quite a rich fiction as the bedrock of this, like a deep lore, like a whole Wicked's worth at this point. So last time we introduced Samuel Roberts Peninsula for the first time.
The autocratic island nation of Matthew Castle Island was, a lot happened there and we thought it'd be fun to flip things around. So yeah, Matthew, how are you feeling about being the lawyer rather than the judge this time?
Yeah, it's good. We've had quite a good batch. I should point out we've had so many entries that we're not going to be going through everything we've been sent.
We've already got some stored up for another future episode because I thought otherwise it would just be too long. We've got some interesting games, some quite funny stories around them, lots of weird fringe cases for you to have to unpick and unchartered territory, legal-wise. I'm very excited to be visiting Samuel Roberts Peninsula.
I love how shit the name of our two countries are.
Yeah, also like that you've called it Samuel Roberts Peninsula Island in this plan that you've written. That's an even worse name.
Yeah, makes no sense. I'm feeling pretty good. I've tried doing a bit of research.
I had to write an opening speech, which you did so brilliantly last time, so I've really been feeling the pressure there. I'm quite nervous about that. It might be chronically unfunny.
That's basically the whole deal with these episodes, is that we just sort of like go in and hope for the best and they tend to come out okay by the end.
Yeah, for sure. So like it is tough. Like I felt a bit of pressure to be funny in this one because Matthew always obviously comes up with the punishment and then fills the courtroom with interesting characters.
I've been given that task this time. The listeners can decide whether it's kind of like I've succeeded or not. I think the funny thing is, Matthew, don't you kind of see this as like the most shameful episode to talk about with our peers, i.e.
people listen to the episode with like Tim or Jen and then listen to or Simon Parkin and then listen to this horseshit and then it's like how is this the same podcast? You know what I mean?
Yes, it's like if you take the same voice out the room, this is what we used to do without time.
Yeah, it really is like, I mean, you know, we're talking about magazine back pages, this has the energy of that for sure, except like taken so far that it's kind of like it's just it's been ill-advisedly given its own bookazine on the shelves.
Back pages tend to have the decency to like fuck off after one issue.
Yeah, it's not like the same joke for like two years, you know.
Yeah, well, yeah, I do. Awata Us was a little bit like that in Nintendo Gamer, but yeah, well, you know, we'll keep doing it until people stop listening.
Or until you panic that you've upset the real Awata or, you know, whatever happened at the time where you kind of started panicking it was racist or something. Didn't that happen once?
No, that happened on official Nintendo where we wrote a Christmas carol as the then president of Nintendo of Europe and both me and Scribs were absolutely convinced we'd sent something hugely inappropriate to print. We worried about it like over the entire Christmas holidays.
Yeah, that's like when I did a new story on Red Dead Redemption 2 being leaked to a PC and worried that I would get sued like that outlet did by Rockstar for like a million pounds and I spent my entire Christmas break thinking that was going to happen and then I came back and I remember like I'm watching The Favourite on the first day that everyone was back at work after Christmas and I thought if I get out the cinema now and like no one's emailed me with a lawsuit I've probably gotten away with it and I thought I like I need I need help like that's that's a ridiculous level of worry to be having about things but yeah so anyway good good stuff good little segue there I will say Matthew before we get into this should we discuss the draft result a little bit oh yeah we haven't had a chance to discuss that it was really well received by the listeners that episode people really dug it and actually I think people were kind of surprised that we were able to pull out some quite good PC gaming knowledge in the end because it's true we don't talk about PC gaming. Well no you had some too you had like more of the graphic adventure.
Oh yeah I had one Grim Fandano anecdote for everyone so that was good.
But it was a great one. It was a great one about one specific transition so it made you sound authoritative even though you're not. So you won and the Trespasser seemed to be the thing that won it for you which I think sets a dangerous precedent but how are you feeling about it?
You know in the politest way possible you've maybe become fixated on the Trespasser element of it. There was Half Life in the mix too and some other biggies but definitely our most vocal listeners definitely bigged up Trespasser as an element and I don't know if that was just some epic trolling. I didn't want to win with Trespasser.
I think it has a place in my draft collection of games for sure that's why I picked it but I was hoping people would legitimately like the other stuff. To be honest, I felt very guilty because I felt like I picked lots of stuff and then did such a shit job of justifying them because my memory is so bad for this particular period and you made some really good cases for my games so I feel like we both won really.
The thing is, I will correct you on something there Matthew, you said memory. You can't have memories of things you haven't played.
I will say I thought your list is really good apart from Trespass. Everything else is great on there. I think Planescape Torment is probably more of a heart pick for people than Bolder Skaters so that was a good pick and I think you picked better in FPS than I did.
I do think afterwards maybe I should have just picked a really safe combo of Doom and Quake 2 or something but I wanted to pick what I was actually playing in the 90s so I could talk about it. It happens. It's all good.
It was fun seeing the response. People just get so into them and we are definitely going to do a 2000 to 2005 PC gaming draft at some point soon. Whether we will do any more from there remains to be seen.
We will see. It is fun talking about PC gaming. We had loads to say it was our longest draft episode by miles.
Yeah, it was like I said, I have never written about it. It's definitely not my area of expertise. So I need a little bit of carrying.
I think as a podcast collective, we created ourselves as well.
I also think that for the next PC gaming draft, you will find that we have got more to say about the next period we are going to do in terms of more first-hand experience. I was saying your side, Matthew, which will be good. And some really good games in there.
So yeah, I'm excited about that. We'll definitely do that later this year. Look out for that.
2000-2005 PC gaming draft. It's going to happen. So on with the game score then, Matthew.
So you've got a bunch of questions here. Do you want to ask me the...
So, you know, we like to set the scene for these episodes as we're no longer on Matthew Castle Island. I'd like to better get to know the judge and the conditions that I'm going to be working in. So, you know, more generally, how are the people of Samuel Roberts Peninsula faring at the moment?
What are the big headlines from the island?
So people may or may not remember from the last Games Court that the entire island had been like, sort of catamaried. So it was sort of like a hell world of things that were stuck together and like a lot of the paperwork was required just to like unstick things. So actually, I've actually written like a little opening court speech here, Matthew, that will sum up a little bit of what's been happening.
Oh, right.
Yeah. So so yeah, welcome to the courtroom. Welcome to Samuel Roberts Peninsula more widely.
In the many weeks that have passed since we annexed this land from Indonesia, we've seen many moments that make this autocracy proud, but none like today, where finally we'll see some boys off the internet get executed for our amusement. A special thanks to everyone who helped us evacuate the Katamari Hellscape that is now known as the Peninsula, formerly known as Samuel Roberts Peninsula. We will now play the national anthem, which was created in Mario Paint in about 15 minutes.
Oh wait, I'm told the snares was left behind on the Katamari Hellscape, along with the barrel that Johnny Sasaki was shitting in. You may proceed. So yeah, that's a little bit of a summary there.
Did you enjoy that?
I loved that. And it may have knobbled some of my opening speech because I assumed we were still on a hell world, a spherical hell world, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
If for the purposes of the comedy we need to move locations again, that's okay. We still technically own the previous land and we don't own this new land that we have. The people of Indonesia are not happy, I'll be honest.
It's just very weird to hear us given such a concrete real world context for where we are. I have no idea where Matthew Castle Island is.
Yeah. I assumed it was just sort of like near North Korea, I don't know, it's similar kind of vibes, I don't know.
I had the idea of coming out, looking across to North Korea, like you're close enough to see it and being like, oh, interesting, that's maybe the way to do it.
I was just having a cup of tea on the porch of my house, and the idea came to me.
Dictator.
I love the idea as well that you're close enough that you can see a dictatorship happening.
I can just see the general oppression.
Oh, that's funny. Yeah, to be honest, I only did this because in my head, I just thought it was really funny, the idea of annexing land and also the peninsula formerly known as Sam Roberts Peninsula. That's the dumb bullshit.
I just wanted to drop in there. So yeah, we'll kind of figure that out, Matthew, but we'll unpick the law.
Yeah.
But please continue. I know you have some more questions.
So traditionally, our courtrooms are swarming with familiar video game faces. Which video game characters do we find in your court today?
Oh, boy. Where to start? So we've got The Merchant from Resident Evil 4, and every single time a defendant will come up, he'll go, what are you buying?
And like, everyone in the courtroom will just burst into like thunderous applause. Because that's brilliant, isn't it? So yeah, he's here.
He's got a coat just full of items. So if you need to buy like, you know, a sort of ammo clip upgrade, he's, you know, give him a shout between when we when we adjourn the court, you know. We've got Nuclear Gandhi from Civilization.
He's like 90% regular Gandhi, but occasionally glitches and declares nuclear war on neighboring countries. That's, you know, tough beat. But, you know, the 90% regular Gandhi is pretty good.
He's good, good guy, Gandhi, wasn't he? We've got Ken Kutaragi here, the father of PlayStation. He keeps creating new consoles and insisting people get a second job to pay for them.
He's got like, he's got like eight new consoles at this point, it's getting out of hand. And we don't have the resources to produce them here, unfortunately. We've got a single Soviet grenadier from Command and Conquer Red Alert.
We've also got a single Allied ore truck from Red Alert. Oh, wait, sorry, the ore truck has just ran over the grenadier. So we now we just have the ore truck, the grenadier is dead.
This has happened in the courtroom.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's tough. You know, it's what happens on the battlefields of Command and Conquer.
Little men get run over by ore trucks and that's what happened. It was very tiny though, to be fair.
Okay, thank you for clarifying, they're not regular size to us.
No, no, they're like, they're like sort of micro machine size, basically.
How do we even know that this has occurred? I don't think I'd notice, I was too distracted by Ken Kaderagi.
Yeah, you just got to be careful not to sit on them, basically. We've got a lot of sort of, you know, Command and Conquer units just like, you know, milling about basically.
It's like ants. You've got like a Command and Conquer infestation in the courtroom. Quick, get a kettle!
There's a lot of engineers running into various appliances and then they like turn red when they've been taken over. It's like a Soviet toaster and microwave, it's rough, you know. That's like, that's for the, you know, the island sort of JCs to sort out, to be honest.
That's not really my problem. So let's see, we've got Tingle from the Zelda games. Larry Butz is here from the Phoenix Wright games.
He fled civilized countries because he's wanted on treason charges. We were happy to shelter him here, though we are fighting like a lot of extradition treaties. It's tough, like, you know, the government, they want him basically, they want to put him on like regular trial for other crimes.
And finally, we've got PS1 Hagrid from the Harry Potter games. He's distanced himself from JK. Rowling, though.
So, you know, he's not as problematic as regular Hagrid. So that's good. So yeah, kind of a warped, misshapen Hagrid there.
So yeah, you happy with that?
What's absolute circus of freaks?
Yeah, it's fantastic, really. It's like, you know, basically as many stupid inside gaming jokes I could cram in, really. So that's good.
So would you like to carry on with your line of questioning here, Matthew?
Yes, absolutely. Yes. So obviously on Matthew Castle Island, Judge Matthew Castle has proven himself.
I think I am separate to the judge in this context.
As in a different person?
I'm not entirely sure. I'm quite jet lagged from the start. Judge Matthew Castle.
No, I am the same person, but I refer to myself in the third person.
Geez, this is convoluted.
Judge Matthew Castle has proven himself most consistent in his rulings. Outside of the question of taste vs money spent, is there any particular dangerous territory that defendants should be looking out for in your court?
If you've bought 2D Mario games that were made post Nintendo DS, it's an immediate execution. Oh dear. I just think that we need to be firm here that 3D Mario is where it's at.
That's what we believe on this island. And if you're going to give the same review scores to 2D Mario games, we're not having it frankly.
I mean, I don't want to spoil what's going to happen, but that's a real tough break for one of my defendants.
Well, look, there's extenuating circumstances. You can cancel it out by grabbing a game of very good taste. Yeah, this, yeah, this, this court doesn't appreciate people who buy games that were rated like 93 on Metacritic for like 20 quid when they're actually worth 90 quid.
And then saying, is this a good purchase? Because we feel that's that's bait, we feel. And we don't think that we don't think that's good content.
So they will also they will also be executed even if the game is like fucking 10 out of 10. So bear that in mind, any bargains on like, you know, GameCube classics, immediate execution. Yeah.
So yeah, with that in mind, yeah, I wish your defendants well. Well, I don't, because I want to kill them for fun.
Yeah. Well, I think I think we might be okay. I think we might be okay.
The court would like to establish something though. Is this a prestige style situation where there are actually two Matthew Castles and there's a bloke outside who's got like, like a fake mustache on who looks exactly like you? Is it like you and your twin?
Like you kind of share the duties between Judge Matthew Castle and defendant like a lawyer on this island? Is that what's going on?
Yeah, basically, we got a we got a prestige situation. It also allows Michael Caine to be here, which is like an important part of this podcast. So yeah, I believe I mean, that was that was going to be the twist at the end of the episode.
But you know, we've spoiled it now.
Michael Caine's here. Okay, that might I mean, there's this potential there. Okay, right.
Yeah, we'll bear that in mind when we get to some of our next the rest of the court to be established. So please, please continue.
So speaking of Caine, obviously, I've had some very creative execution methods on Matthew Castle Island. How will defendants be? I like I was going to say, how will defendants be put to death if found guilty, assuming that they will be put to death?
Yep. Oh, of course. Yeah.
Thank you. Good.
So I made this too complicated. It's like I've written like three paragraphs here on what I'll do. And like, no joke is is good when you have to explain it that much.
So I'll be brief. So the guilty will be sliced into pieces by Raiden from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. Much like in that game, he'll extract this blue thing from inside each of the listeners that represents their conscious self in the form of a physical item.
And then their conscious selves will be uploaded by Otacon into the digital afterlife. And that is the world's one remaining PlayStation home server. There, guilty listeners will be doomed to wander around a single boring, empty digital apartment until the end of time, or until the one original model PS3 on Sammy Roberts Peninsula breaks down, whichever happens first.
And, because Michael Caine is here, I'd like to get him involved. He will have to take the blue thing and plug it into the computer for Otacon to work. And so he'll just be a bit sad about that.
Oh no.
So they'll be sliced into little pieces like a melon, basically. And then, yeah, the remains will be fed to hyenas outside.
And they're so uploaded to the worst digital place you can possibly exist.
Yeah, but, you know, it's like digital purgatory, basically. You know what? Mark Zuckerberg really loves it.
I will say that. Like he's sort of big into it. So, you know, hey.
What an endorsement. That is a truly cursed death. I think we can work with that.
I mean, work against it. I obviously don't want that to happen.
Work with that. Work with that.
I don't want any of my clients to suffer that fate.
Yeah, that's fine. So yeah, quite complicated there. It involves multiple Metal Gear characters.
But yeah, I think that like the other... Uploaded into the digital, digital purgatory I just thought was a terrific punishment.
So I love how your thing is full of specificity about what's going to happen, but it also has he's going to pull this blue thing from you.
Well, that's what he does in the game, isn't it? That's what he does in the game. Then he sort of like slaps it into himself and gets a power boost.
I don't really know what the fuck is going on in that game. It was quite average. I'm actually like really a side note.
We started prepping for like best games of 2013 to do in July and there's a big question mark over whether Revengeance is getting anywhere near that list because I don't really like it. So yeah, we can litigate that on a future date. So okay, Matthew, I believe you have prepped an opening statement.
So if you please.
First of all, I'd like to apologize to everyone in the courtroom if I look a little worse for wear. I've traveled here from our annual musical festival on Castle Island. The headline act this year, same as every other year, Pulp.
Let that bed in. I would like to wish a good morning to the men, women and bandly rendered Chewbacca's of the jury. I'd like to say it, but I don't understand the whole morning concept as time is banned on Castle Island.
Is morning the one that happens before or after we get our ration of nutrient paste?
Oh, it's really good. I've enjoyed it.
Also, I'm not entirely sure why we even have a jury, given that Samuel Roberts Peninsula, the world renowned Katamari hellscape, is in the grip of the same breed of tyrant as Castle Island. It is Judge Roberts who decides your fate this day. A man so twisted, he enrolled you as citizens of his country, only to literally enrol you into a giant pool.
Little did we know that when he stood on his border, beckoning us to emigrate with the words, roll up, roll up, he meant them so literally.
Is that the whole speech?
No, there's more to come.
Okay, carry on.
My clients stand in this courtroom accused of wasting their personal funds to frivolously revisit the hits of yesteryear. Arguably, it is nostalgia that is on trial today, and who are we to judge such an intangible concept? Can you even execute nostalgia?
Does it have a body to pulp, or lungs to explode as a miserable Michael Caine watches helplessly outside the tank? These are just a hint of the moral quandaries that face us today. I only wish we were in more reasonable hands to face these questions.
Judge Roberts' legal credentials? All he knows about the law he learned from watching films. Legal classics such as 12 Angry Badly-Rendered Chewbacca's.
And John Grisham's seminal legal thriller, A Time to Kill, or as it's known on Castle Island, A To Kill. The fates of my client rely not on the logic of my arguments, but on whether this man is in a bad mood because the Thai Hut was already sold out by the time he got there. A man who purports to champion democracy only to scream in the face of the voters when they choose Jurassic Park Trespasser over some boring strategy games no one cares about.
Oh, fuck you. I will not have Alpha Centauri. I mean, mate, you're getting uploaded to PlayStation Home if you're okay, Tom.
A man who thinks the Eternals is better than Thor Ragnarok.
So do you!
That's one for the Patreons.
Yes, truly he is scraping the bottom of the barrel, and on Samuel Roberts' blitz, yeah, that barrel is full of Johnny Sasaki shit. If I don't win in this sham of a court, I deserve to die. And that's the promise I make to my clients.
No win, no fee, no more life for me. I rest my case.
That's good. But like Lilo Hutz, you can put different commas in there to change the meaning of the phrase. So yeah, okay, that was really good.
You did a fine job there. You didn't lean as much into personal insults as I did when I did yours, because as I told you in Discord earlier this week, Matthew, I am a bastard and you're not. So yeah, good, good, good.
Okay, cool. So yeah, let's get some boys uploaded into PlayStation Home, shall we? After being cut into tiny pieces, I think it's going to be exciting.
So yeah, I mean, I'm thrilled, frankly, because I don't know what's coming. So you know, it's all a surprise to me. But yeah, let's see what you got.
Let's do it. Let's do it.
So, we begin with exhibit A, Your Honour. Do you like to be addressed, Your Honour?
Yep, but with the U, not with just the no. Okay.
Thank you for clarifying. This is from Pizza Hotline. A lot of these are from Discord, so they've got like weird names, they're not human names.
Hello Chaps and Michael Caine. This may be a first in eBay Games Court, but I believe I am guilty of a BUI, which is buying under the influence. After a big night at an arcade bar in London called Four Quarters East playing virtual tennis, I bought a copy of it on the Dreamcast for eight pounds off the Sex.
Sex.exe website. Sex website. Very different vibes.
However, the following Tuesday, to my surprise, I received two copies of it. After checking my emails, it turns out I got so destroyed I ordered this game twice in one night with no memory of doing so. Please have mercy on me for I was not myself.
Right, okay. Interesting, because I feel like the Matthew Castle Island set a good precedent on this, which is if you buy the same game twice, well, in that case, it was more on multiple formats, but here it's the same format. I don't think we can tolerate that in this courtroom.
I will say that I have also bought games under the influence as well. That's where, say, a Grandia 1 and 2 collection on Switch might sneak into my library. And I only realize it when I look at my phone and have a PayPal notification the next morning.
So, you know, that's what a crazy bender looks like for me these days.
Where you roll over in bed and bump your head against the Steel Battalion controller. And you're like, whoa, what did I do?
Oh dear, yeah, so, you know.
I will say, critically beloved game, Virtua Tennis.
Yeah, you know, I love Virtua Tennis.
Metacritic.
Yeah, I love Virtua Tennis. Like it's, you know, it's, you know, like a lot of these Dreamcast games are like the best versions of some of these series that came out, or like the most beloved versions at least. And yeah, I was always a big Virtua Tennis fan.
Like nice, simple dynamic. I'm more into that than the old Mario Tennis, to be honest. So Matthew, Matthew Castle may disagree on that, but yeah, a Sega classic.
If you just bought OG Virtua Tennis and just by itself, I'd have been fine, but you bought the same game twice. And like, without offering a reason of like, of like what you would do with the second copy, which I think I need to know in order to like, you know, judge what you like, if you're just going to keep it and it's just going to be sat on your shelf, like I'm not having that. But if you're going to tell me that like, oh yeah, I sent it to like another Back Page listener, they fucking, who just bought their first Dreamcast, I'd be like, well, I can forgive that on grounds of like empathy, do you know what I mean?
But like, no, I've got, he's, take him outside to Raiden, that's what I say.
I love that you just said in the previous sentence, you're talking about empathy and on grounds of empathy, straight into, let's go and hand him to the sword bastard outside.
Yeah, we need to get this lad uploading to PlayStation Home's stat, that's, yeah. So, yeah, okay, so that's one guilty, I'm afraid.
One dead so far, well, I can say I can live with it, and we'll see.
If this island had voters, they have to see that I'm a man of action. It doesn't have voters, because it's an autocracy.
Oh, all right, sweet.
Yeah.
Exhibit B is from Tom Newcomb. He says, back in 2014, I ordered a copy of Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball for the original Xbox for 46 pence. I bought it with Dead or Alive 3 and the combined cost with postage was £4.52.
When it arrived, I realized I couldn't play it on my Xbox 360 as it was not made available with backwards compatibility. In the most recent update to backwards compatibility for Xbox One, they added Dead or Alive 3, but they have yet to give the horny volleyball spin-off the same love, and they have announced they aren't making any more games backwards compatible for the time being. I have had this game taking up space for a decade and haven't been able to play it yet.
Its trade-in value is low. If anyone looks at my Xbox games, they think I am a pervert.
I would say the whole, like, you can't play it on modern format thing, that's on Microsoft, not you. I would say that's on them. And like, you know, I'm very aware that, I mean, I work in video games PR now, and the optics of making, like, a live extreme volleyball backwards compatible are great.
It's like, you know, it's like making one, like a Senran Kagura, like putting that on, like, if I imagine that was like a PS Plus game for the month or something, do you know what I mean?
Yeah, but you could do it as a big, like, sex positivity drive.
I mean, that is like, I mean, how positive are we talking?
I would just like, you know, just to show what the consensus was around this game at the time, Eurogamer gave it a 3 out of 10, but the renowned horndogs, Edge, gave it an 8 out of 10.
8 out of 10. That's, Edge gave that an 8.
Edge gave Dead or Alive, Extreme Volleyball, Extreme Beach Volleyball an 8 out of 10, and they wrote, I quote, By departing from established video game norms and offering an experience that is unfettered by restrictive goals and objectives, Tecmo has succeeded in evoking a supremely relaxing vacation atmosphere and producing a quite unique and singularly satisfying game.
Okay, well-
Also, homida homida hobida.
I was gonna say, did like, did a production editor have to like remove like 17 instances of the word bouncing boobs, you know what I mean?
If only we could talk to the babes.
It took me a second to twig there. That's really good, if only we could talk to the babes. That's so good, Matthew.
I love that Edge really went to bat for this game. That is such a, that is such a, like, this period Edge kind of move.
Yeah, I can sort of see what they mean. Like it did have a very different vibe. It was just like a series of mini games stretched over like a two or three week holiday or something.
Like, I think this may, you know, this goes against everything this podcast stands for. I think that's an interesting purchase. Like that's an interesting artifact, that game.
From a time where like, I feel like Dead or Alive had quite a lot of cred at the time. You know, I was, I played Dead or Alive, I actually got Dead or Alive 3 on my Xbox. So when it went backwards compatible a few months ago and it does look very nice and still fun to play.
Yeah, I think like, I'm gonna allow this, it's a good curio. And I don't think like you'll be showing many people your Xbox collection and then be judging you. Do you know what I mean?
Like, it's not like, oh, my girlfriend came over and she saw my Xbox collection. Like, I mean, anecdotes of that nature are dubious at best. So yeah, I'm not guilty, Matthew.
Oh, amazing, fantastic stuff. Edge will approve.
46p isn't bad for a bit smart, is it?
Exhibit C is from Jamie on Discord. They're all on Discord. I shouldn't keep saying that.
This one's going to be tough. This one's going to be pretty hard, given something you said earlier. My submission to the court is that me and my brother bought two copies of New Super Mario Brothers 2 for the 3DS.
After buying one copy and being disappointed, I became obsessed with the idea that it would be fun in multiplayer. Unlike the Wii version, to play multiplayer, you need two copies. So I convinced my brother, who had just won a 25 pound Amazon voucher for 100% attendance at school, to go halves on the second copy.
Oh, this is really sad, this.
Again, I love the specificity of it, it's great. Needless to say, it was a horrendous disappointment. And for a combined 80 quid, this was a lot of money for two 14 year olds.
We now only have one copy after using one as a frisbee, which we dubbed the Golden Frisbee on account of its price, which obviously ended up in a neighbor's garden. When we went round to collect the Golden Frisbee, the neighbor lied, saying it wasn't there and kept the game for himself. But frankly, it wasn't worth arguing over.
Please don't kill my brother, it was my idea. Open season on the neighbor though.
Okay, so we've got three people potentially on trial here. So I think that, like, I think Jamie has to die, because I think it is sad that, like...
I mean, no, no.
I mean, like, you have established on the previous episodes that you don't like this game, Matthew. And I'm just not really, I'm not really doing it with the old 2D Mario games. I think as a civilization, it's time to move on, you know what I mean?
So, yep, that, that, oh, bear in mind, the brother is spared, I would say, because I feel he wasn't innocent in this. The neighbor, well, the neighbor didn't spend anything to get this. If anything, I think the neighbor is like the best person in this anecdote, because they got a free game.
And you were dumb enough to use a 3DS game as a frisbee, which is stupid on so many levels.
Would a box even, does a box have a frisbee?
Yeah, I was gonna say, I mean, I feel like maybe it does aerodynamically because they're quite thin, aren't they? But I mean, certainly not as much as a real frisbee, which by the way, why don't you just get one of those?
You could have bought like 40 frisbees with the Amazon voucher.
Yeah, the perfect attendance thing is like, it adds like a little heartbreaking kind of like sort of Ken Loach element to the whole thing. Yeah, I don't know. It's tough.
Let's think. Yeah, okay, so the neighbor is going to be knighted on Sammy Roberts Peninsula because they spent nothing and got a 3DS game. I had a great alibi, which is like, how implausible is it that someone comes to your door and says, oh, excuse me, sir, we were using a copy of a video game as a frisbee and lost it in your garden.
You'd be like, well, that's so ridiculous. It can't possibly be real. So, which is a great bit of like, you know, deflection to those kids.
And yeah, so yeah, the neighbor is the best person in the anecdote. The brother is spared. Jamie is uploading to PlayStation Home.
Oh, I want all anecdotes rated now on who the best person in any particular anecdote is.
Best person, you can tell I'm slightly hungover, can't you, best person?
At the end of the anecdote, that's how you finish every anecdote, you know. And the best person was my uncle, who tripped over that rake. That's too dead.
I should have said MVP, shouldn't I?
He's the MVP of the anecdote.
Yeah, that's a very tedious Mario game. And also, I should also say at this point, like, this is meant to sort of be pre-owned games. Like, I used to have a bit of a general rule, but I think too many people are putting in just new games.
You're just buying games for new for money. Let's try and stick to the eBay and the sex shop, if possible.
I think so, because I think, like, the monetary price is part of what we're judging on. So if it's the RRP, that's no good, really.
We want the kind of like... I mean, that's us judging Sony or Microsoft at that point. That's got nothing to do with you.
I like, the element I like about Games Court is the Wild West, like, CX pretend stock market nature of, like, the game prices. That's like the fun bit, you know? That's...
One day I've got to go back on trial for spending 90 quid on Paper Mario, a thousand-year door, so yeah. You can imagine how that's gonna go, but yeah.
Don't get too attached to your leader, Samuel Roberts Peninsula, that's what I'd say.
Okay, next exhibit, Matthew.
Oh, and they're physically attached to you because you all got merged into that ball, so.
Hey, no, we've moved on from that now.
Oh, sorry, I forgot, yeah.
Yeah, we're just settling on this land formerly known as Indonesia. But yeah, we're just having some problems with the UN, but that's not for this courtroom.
Weird vibes. Exhibit D is from Campbell or Camp Underscore Bell. I assume it's Campbell, I don't know, who knows?
Anyway, let's not get lost in the weeds of the name. All right, you see, this is a classic Games Court entry. I bought Auto Modelista on PS2 for 18 pounds from CEX.
In my defense, it's pretty unique as racing games go, and like most of these things, it will never be reissued due to licensing. Then they say, I'll get my snorkel, which is probably a reference to drowning in a prestige box.
Won't save you in this courtroom, I'm afraid.
But that's several Games Courts ago, so no risk of that. Yeah, so Auto Modelista, the Capcom cell-shaded racing game.
I think this is absolutely fine because, yes, the game was not well-reviewed at the time, but it did look amazing. The cell-shading made this a really coveted game for me, reading games magazines in the noughties. It looks so beautiful in screenshots.
I think it's worth owning just for the aesthetics of it alone. So yeah, I think not guilty. Auto Modelista, yeah, you're right, they will never re-release this because it had real cars in it.
I mean, why did they do that? What's the point? It's cell-shaded, so who cares?
It's not like you can impress people with the realism. You might as well make some cars up. Do you know what I mean?
Children's scrawled doodle of a Ferrari.
That's on Capcom, not The Defendant. So what we're going to do is we're going to take the snorkel, we're going to extradite the director of Auto Modelista, and they're going to be drowned by Michael Caine. But that doesn't affect the verdict on you, which is you are not guilty, sir.
So we have two not guilty, two guilty, sir.
We're doing all right. A side note, I watched a little video of Auto Modelista, because I haven't played it myself, and it's got a big shouty commentator over the top, kind of Capcom style, I guess, saying, like, nice corner, nice drift, all that kind of stuff. But it really scolds you if you're paying poorly.
And in this footage, the person wasn't doing very well, and it was constantly repeating, why are you so bad? Which I was quite taken with. Why are you so bad?
That is good.
Why are you so bad?
That's like, how disappointing could a racing game be on PS2 in the noughties when it looks this good? I could never quite put that together in my head. Like, it's handling that bad.
Do you know what I mean?
But by that same logic, I got really pumped for that 13, and that was purest ass.
That game's got quite a good reputation, and I remember it being quite rough. It did look nice, but yeah, it was bumpy.
Games that look amazing in magazines, but the second they start to move, you're like... Yeah.
Yeah. But enough about Akami. That's a joke.
So, yeah. Okay, good. So as the merchant just said, what are you buying?
next exhibit, please.
Okay, thank you. This is where I find out the person who made Auto Model Easter was actually like Shootakumi. We killed him.
So that's how it always is with those games, isn't it? It's like... Anyway.
Exhibit E. This is from Serrano. Here's a naughty legal problem.
This is for Dead or Alive, and I'd just welcome a bit of clarification from the judge. In lockdown, I got re-obsessed with the 3DS and bought a new 3DS... Oh wait, it's not about Dead or Alive.
He's saying Dead or Alive. He wants some clarification.
I was going to say, like, how many of these people were horny in lockdown and bought fucking Dead or Alive games?
Sorry, that's very confusing. You cannot write the words Dead or Alive in a video game related message and not expect me to think of the video game first. Dead or Alive, I'd welcome some clarification from the judge.
In lockdown, I got re-obsessed with the 3DS and bought a new 3DS XL from eBay for £110. So this is what's on trial, is the 3DS XL for £110. I think it is anyway.
Let's follow it through. But that wasn't just to play. It was so I could transfer my account to the new 3DS and jailbreak the new 2DS I already had so I could play translated Japanese ROMs on it without risking my access to the games I'd already bought.
Eventually, on my jailbroken 2DS, I played Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 3. I've had a real fondness for the series since I was a kid, playing the game with my best friend, but this one was never translated or released in the West. Today, I picked up my 2DS again to play Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 3 Professional.
It's the same game with extra bits, and that's all that I've played on it. Help me judge. I have no idea if this was a good purchase or if I'm even having a good time.
So I just want to unpick this. The thing that's on trial is the 3DS XL he bought, but he then tells us an anecdote about something else that he was doing.
So I feel like there's two elements to this. I'm judging both the purchase and what happened to that other 3DS.
Yeah, so I mean, that's technically not an eBay question, but yeah, like, yeah, a 3DS XL for £110 and whether jailbreaking a 2DS to only play the same game on it twice was a waste of time, I guess.
I mean, there's one other thing I would unpick here as well, which is why is the subtitle to Dragon Quest Monsters III a professional? Like, what the fuck? It's not like buying Microsoft Word or something, is it?
I think this was the updated version of Joker III.
Yeah, much like the final mix.
So it's like, instead of like, limited edition. I mean, this is Square Enix, who've got quite good form on like, ludicrous, you know, look at all those Kingdom Hearts remake subtitles. They're like a nightmare.
Yeah, okay, yeah. So I played the original Dragon Quest Monsters on DS. It was actually one of the most graphically impressive games on DS.
Do you remember it, Matthew?
Yeah, yeah. It's like a proper full...
Yeah, like a full 3D RPG. Quite boring. I thought it was a very boring kind of Pokemon riff.
Yeah. Just like wandering around this quite bare-looking island. And once you got over the looks, it was a bit like air.
I was not taken with it enough to even keep it in my collection. It's gone. Long gone, that one.
Along with Viva Pinata on DS, which I wasn't massively into either. I think I'm going to say not guilty, because the act of wanting to play these RPGs that were never translated is fine by me. This is not like Japanese court.
This is like Samuel Roberts Peninsula Court. So I make the laws. We don't condone piracy, but in the name of learning more about computer games, we'll let it go this time.
That's decent of you.
Yeah, I think also a 3DS for 110 quid, I think is a good price. Because like all games consoles in the pandemic, the prices just went fucking massively up just because people were suddenly buying loads of them. And I don't think you can even get a 3DS under 150 quid these days, like in Good Nick.
You can't buy brand new at all now, of course. So yeah, I think that's a good purchase. So yeah, we're all good.
Brilliant. Off you go, Serano. And the crowd goes wild, which is good.
Yeah, I was tempted to pop him in PlayStation Home for just a year and see how he gets on. But we'll leave that for another time.
I don't think that Ken Kiguragi is going to be too impressed that this court is on board with piracy.
Yeah, I suppose not. But he's too busy making another console that has four different types of chip in it and is therefore impossible to port Assassin's Creed 2.
It's a new PlayStation, but it's only backwards compatible with Sega Saturn. It's completely fucking balmy and it costs 800 quid.
And PS3 games, of course. It comes bundled with Eye of Judgment, the card game with the iToy. Also, PS1 Hagrid, his face has just sort of collapsed.
He's sort of rendering in and out of space at the moment.
And the rest of the possessions from the original, Samuel Roberts Island, Samuel Roberts Peninsula, have shipped. And so Johnny Sasaki's shit barrel has just been, has just docked.
Oh, no. It's not in the courtroom yet, though. It's still outside, but it's on its way.
Not sure about Johnny himself, but the barrel is here.
We know it is going to appear in the room at some point.
It's rough in there, man. It's tough. Yeah, it's been a while.
Okay, continue. What are you buying next up?
This one's a bit odd, but it's related to the last one. I think this is just someone looking for permission to hack a PSP. Exhibit F from Snot Rocket.
Doesn't fill me with hope when you hear that name in a court.
This makes it sound like fucking all of the people in our Discord are in between as characters.
Your Honour, I'm generally a law-abiding citizen. However, I feel compelled to jailbreak my PSP to play Hilton Garden in Ultimate Teamplay. May I plead for leniency on the grounds of insanity?
So they're owning. This person hasn't done anything. I think they're just looking for permission to hack their PSP to play a very obscure Hilton Hotel's licensed game.
It doesn't sound interesting enough to break the law for, if you ask me. So if you're asking for my permission, you won't get it. Will I kill you over it?
Well, I haven't got enough to judge you on, really. So I'm going to have you cut up and killed anyway. Fantastic.
But you only have to spend five years on PlayStation Home, at which point your digital self can be uploaded to another bullshit metaverse of your choosing. So yeah, okay, it's sort of like guilty, but not a life sentence. It is a life sentence, but you will exist forever still.
You have no body to return to, because it's been chopped up by Raiden.
That's true, yeah. We'll sort that out. We'll upload you into PS1 Hagrid, and you can take over his body.
That is an even worse fate, I would argue. Imagine being PS1 Hagrid's body, and you're trying to explain to your family that it's actually you. It's me!
Ask me something! Only snot rocket would know!
By the way, nuclear Gandhi has just left the courtroom to go and declare war on Wales.
Does he do this on behalf of your country?
Well, I don't know. It's dicey.
Is he the head of your military?
He's sort of like a man with no nation at the moment. He's just very controversial compared to regular Gandhi.
I'll say.
Sorry about that, Wales.
So, future note. Things you have bought pre-owned is the concept of pre-owned Games Court.
Some might say it's the job of the lawyer to actually curate that and make sure these are all Games Court entries instead of finding out midway through the recording.
Well, you know, I made a rod for my own back there.
It's like, yeah. Criticising what people have sent in when you chose to read it out on the podcast.
That's amazing. I should have picked the ones that I knew you'd be into.
It's all good.
Exhibit G is from Nin Chiller. They open with this. Perfect Dark Zero was not a good game, but it was released early in the 360s life.
It was a launch game, I believe. And there was a bit of studio pedigree at work when I first bought it. I finished it, mostly hating it by the end.
Not making a good case so far. And then traded it in. Several months later I was having a conversation with a friend about terrible level design.
Something I consider Perfect Dark Zero a prime example of. Areas are regularly so confusing, the game actually includes an option to turn on a glowing line on the floor that tells you exactly where to go. I didn't feel like I was able to adequately convey how bad I thought this was, so right there and then I walked my friend 20 minutes to the nearest game shop, bought the game again second hand, then returned to my house, just to demonstrate it to him.
I don't remember how much it cost. Great. But if that's any defence at all, I still do have the game on my shelf as a sort of totem to terrible level design.
I place myself at the mercy of the court and await your judgement.
This obviously must have happened a long time ago, right? Because, I mean, anyone who's buying Perfect Dark Zero by itself now, what are you playing at? Because you can just get the Rare Replay Collection that includes that and many other games, most of which are pretty good.
One of which is Jet Force Gemini, of course, which I'm not turning off. So, yeah, no monetary value. That's annoying as well.
So I need to know how much you lost doing it. Do you know what? I'm just going to kill them.
They're dead. Just because I feel like there was barely an effort made to justify it. It's like I have to buy this game to illustrate what bad level design is.
I'm not buying it. You got YouTube there. Do you know what I mean?
Just go find the level on there. This would have been at least 2006. YouTube was available.
You could have found a Let's Play to illustrate this. I think this is a flex to show how much credit you had on your fucking CEX card. Do you know what I mean?
It was actually a game station. I cut that out for the sake of brevity.
Well, this must have been a long time ago then, because the game station was gone by the late noughties, wasn't it? People are submitting fucking historical war crimes basically for Games Court. I need more specifics.
But to send an example, I put them to death.
Okay, next up is from Nathan Brady Eastham. I spent £37 on Time Hollow for the Nintendo DS. No box or instructions included.
Drown me, pulp me, shoot me out of a cannon into whatever approximation of the sun exists on Castle Island. I don't care anymore. I just want to feel something.
This is a subgenre of entries where they're like basically freaks who are out to be punished by me pretending to be a judge.
Yeah, big step on me daddy energy.
It's big, big that, which I'm not into.
It makes me feel disgusting, do you know what I mean? I'm not Lady Demetresque, do you know what I mean? So that's the whole entry, right?
Yeah, that's the whole entry. So £37, which is probably more... Yeah, in this game would have been £30 at launch.
Yeah, okay, so Time Hollow is by the Shadow of Memories director, right? Like it's a sort of time travel puzzle game?
Yeah, kind of a graphic adventure. Some say visual novel, but I think there's a bit more going on. Kind of in the sort of Phoenix Wright wheelhouse, time travel adventure on the DS.
I liked it to the tune of 70%.
Yeah, it got kind of like middling reviews, I think, didn't it? I think this is an interesting purchase. And one that I imagine was motivated by listening to this podcast when Matthew did go to bat for it on a previous episode.
I too have looked at this one. The prices are ridiculous for it. You're definitely paying upwards of that if you want a box copy.
So I don't mind that you just got it by itself. A lot of my DS games are just by themselves and kept in my little Horrie cases. Those little books, they're really nice.
So yeah, I'm not guilty. I think that's a good purchase. That's a good interesting deep dive.
That's what this court's looking for. Not fucking, I bought this bad Xbox FPS and then bought it again. You know what I mean?
We want to see a bit of taste here. That's what this court is looking for.
Well, I'm glad that's now 4-4. I'd say things aren't looking good or bad for me.
Do you get killed if you fail?
Well, I did promise to kill myself. In my opening speech.
Oh yeah, that's a lot to live up to.
I mean, maybe that was just, maybe that was showboating.
I mean, speaking of showboating, I did just say this court is the arbiter of good taste and then remembered that I let the dead or alive extreme volleyball guy live. So like, that is demonstrably not true.
Yeah, you and Edge. It's basically just, why don't you just get Tony Mott around to play some multiplayer?
Hey look, we, Tony probably didn't give that 8 out of 10. Don't besmirch his good name with that.
They did put it on the cover because it was the crotch from the beach shot, wasn't it? On the girls issue.
The girls issue. Do you think they felt pressure to give it an 8 based on that? They were like, look, this may have looked like editorially dubious, but we stand by this game.
Do you know what I mean?
Just the panda in a bikini on the cover. That's probably some bullshit in that game, I imagine.
Isn't that from Tekken, the panda?
They've all got some kind of bear, haven't they?
Well, I mean, what kind of bear are we talking about here? It's just like, it's just men and women in Dead or Alive. I don't think there's like an animal.
Oh, that's what I... Okay, yeah, that actually does sound more Tekken. Isn't that Kuma?
Isn't that the bear in that?
There's a panda called Panda and then, yeah, a bear and then a robot man, Yoshimitsu, yeah.
Well, that's me schooled. Exhibit I... Ah, I just went crazy on my document.
Ah, PS... Right, strike that from the court record. Exhibit I, Jimmy S.
Bowers says, I wanted to play through the Metal Gear Solid and Killzo games chronologically and already owned a PS4 and PS5. I know that puts me at the risk of death, as Judge Castle once said, can you imagine being a Killzone person? And I stand by that, but I still represent you because I'm good like that.
Also, Matthew did pick Killzone Liberation in the PSP, PS Vita draft, so let's not forget that.
I love that you remember these things, because it just proves to me that these things sort of niggle away at you.
Well, it's just because, like, it allows me to use them as ammunition later on, where you make a decision that you hate, just to try and beat me in a poll.
Because that's really the core of all good friendships, is collecting ammunition to use against the other person down the line.
I told you, I'm the bastard and you're the good guy. You're the best person in every anecdote, Matthew.
That's what I like to hear. That being said, I'll continue. I had most of the Metal Gear Solid games digitally on my Vita, but it broke during the pandemic.
So I went out and spent £145 on a secondhand PS3 and PS2, as well as a bunch of the games that I didn't have. I did that from a combination of CEX and cash converters. I played through all of Snake Eater before I realised that all of the mainline MGS and Killzone games are available on PS Now.
And I could have played them all on the consoles I already owned. And then he also says, I'll be able to play these physical games when those services that prop up the digital versions are dead and gone, so please judge me accordingly. Bit of a tangled one, £145 for what we're basically saying PS3 and PS2 and the Metal Gears and Killzones for those consoles.
That seems good to me as a price. So obviously this court likes Metal Gear, we have Metal Gear characters on this peninsula performing executions for amusement, that's good. You are giving up nice looking versions of the games to play the originals, which are a little bit rougher.
But there's no harm in a bit of PS2 nostalgia, we all love the PS2 here. Killzone, I'm more leaning on Killzone than Matthew, I think Killzone 2 and 3 are legit good shooters. The fiction was never fun with Brian Cox being space Nazi or whatever.
I wasn't really into that. But the actual, how nice they looked on PS3 at the time, how the guns felt, how it had this quite nice first person cover system. I dug all that.
Of all the brown games released on PS3, I think the Killzone were actually up there. And there were fucking a lot of brown games on that console.
Side note, Killzone vs Resistance, which series comes out on top?
I'm personally more into Resistance myself. I think it's just because there's a bit more variety over the course of the series. Resistance riffs more on Half-Life than Killzone does, particularly 1 and 3.
And then 2's got all the fun set pieces with the big monsters. Yeah, you know, these were solid brown games. Sounds disgusting, doesn't it?
Yeah, so, solid brown.
Solid brown. We got a barrel of that on its way to the courtroom.
Yeah, so, yeah, not guilty. Jimmy's a good guy.
I don't think it's true anyway that all those are on PS now.
No, not natively.
In that case, Solid 4 doesn't exist anywhere, right, apart from PS3.
Yeah, even so, like, they would be the PS3 version and it wouldn't be natively supported. So you'd be streaming it, not actually playing it. So, yeah, I don't know.
I don't think it's the same thing. So buying the physical games, yeah, much better idea. So not guilty, Matthew.
Nice.
I can't rule out that Jimmy will later be taken to Matthew Castle Island and Palt because Matthew hates the Killzone games that much.
The second he's going to get bundled into a van as he leaves the courtroom.
Bundled into a barrel.
Oh, the worst barrel. Exhibit J is from John Cheetham. It says, bought for 17...
What does an S followed by a dollar mean? Bought for 17 of my local currency on Carousel, which is like a mini eBay in Southeast Asia, plus £1.50 in my local currency postage. I got a PS3 box copy of Demon's Souls.
Considering I've loved every Modern From game from Dark Souls to Bloodborne to Elden Ring, it might seem like a no brainer. The thing I fear will make the difference between John the Ordinary Man and John the Tannenrich vintage accompaniment to a red meat and seafood meal is the fact that I don't actually own a PS3. I will endeavour to get one second hand at a future point if Judge Castle, if Judge Roberts, will forgo a pulping just this once.
So it's the classic, bought it, can't play it.
Right, OK, the original Demon's Souls. There is an updated version of Demon's Souls. It feels like a pointless flex to have this original by itself.
You can't play it, the servers are offline. It is an interesting sort of artifact if you have a PS3. But because you don't, yeah, I'm afraid it's going to be...
It'll have to put you in bits, then put you in PlayStation Home, I'm afraid. Yeah, sorry about that, John. You seem like a good guy, but you know, that can't be fucking about on Sammy Roberts' peninsula.
Brutal.
Yeah.
Absolutely brutal.
Matthew Castle, Judge Castle would do the same, I think.
Yeah, probably. I'd probably do it for like anything from, just to put the from fanboys in their place a bit. But, you know, I'm childish like that.
I bought my PS4 ahead of the release of Bloodborne, but my ulterior motive was to play the Final Fantasy XV demo, having waited the better part of a decade since the reveal of Versus 13, and I had obsessively analysed every pixel of every pre-rendered trailer. I ordered the physical collector's edition of Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, which would give me access to the XV demo, as well as a relatively mediocre port of a PSP game. The collector's edition cost me 90 quid.
On release day, I was notified that delivery would be delayed by one day. Although I could have made peace with waiting Amiga 24 hours to try the demo, I decided to pursue instant gratification and purchase the digital copy of PSN for 40 quid. I only ever played the demo once and then slogged through Type 0, paying around 130 quid in total for the privilege.
To make matters worse, the exact same problem arose 18 months later with the release of 15 itself. I ordered the collector's edition, probably around £90, and was notified of a two-day delay, so I also bought the digital edition. Although I don't have the exact figures, I'd estimate I've spent upwards of 250 quid of Type 0 and Final Fantasy 15.
After taking a hard long look at myself, I didn't buy another game for 18 months until God of War released. I paid a more respectable price for that and only bought it once. I know it's not pre-owned, but I thought it was an interesting an interesting fringe case for us to explore.
No, that is interesting. So I bought the same game twice.
And you did it twice?
Yeah. So yeah, eventually had like two copies of the Final Fantasy 15 demo and Final Fantasy 15 itself. And then twice.
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I can certainly empathize with someone who was following games closely and following Final Fantasy very closely back when you had to do that through like Japanese sort of translations of Japanese interviews with Tensei and Amura and stuff, because there was no proper Square Enix back then in Europe.
And it was rough. It was a rough time. And I think I remember being really hyped for Versus 13 and becoming more and more convinced it was never coming out.
I don't know what the hell happened on that, but nothing annoys me more from Final Fantasy fans than people saying they wanted Versus 13 more than the actual 15 they made. So yeah, that always annoys me. I was a big fan of Final Fantasy 15.
Versus, sorry, what's this called? Was it Type Zero? Yeah, it was.
Yeah, Type Zero.
Yeah, Type Zero. I think it's known as Agito 13 at some point or something like that. But yeah, I played this.
It was very mediocre. It's certainly not worth owning twice. It's like, it feels like a PSP game.
I imagine the Crisis Core redo this year will feel a bit like this, where it's like, it will look shiny on the surface, but then you'll realize from the truncated levels and stuff that it's actually firmly a PSP sort of game. It's okay. I broke this game by messing with my PC clock to make my character level up faster because you could do that in this game.
But the combat was kind of repetitive, and it was just not that interesting. I was a bit disappointed. I think it would have been spot on for a late-in-the-day PSP release.
It actually shipped on two UMDs at the time, which would be a great thing to own, I think, a multi-UMD game. So yeah, it's the only game that ever did that, so jam-packed it was. But God, I want to say guilty on the first set of purchases, because that's, like, ridiculous.
For Type Zero, that's just way too much to pay. 15, I'm going to say that's not guilty, because I was so hyped for 15. I kind of get the impulse there.
But you can't just do that for every Final Fantasy game. You'll be a massive debt. Do you know what I mean?
How many entries are you going to buy multiple times? Pick digital or physical, my friend.
I see this happening a lot. On game release days, on forums, you see a lot of people who are basically wigging out that their thing isn't going to get there in time. And so they buy the digital one and they're like, oh, don't worry, I can sell this one on.
And I wonder how many people do and how many people just end up with two copies of this, that or the other.
Yeah, waste of money on that one. You can support our Patreon at patreon.com/backpagepod and get exclusive bonus podcasts.
For the price of one collector's edition of Final Fantasy Type Zero HD, you can feed me and Samuel for a year.
Yeah, that's a lot of... That's probably like 15 J.C.'s kitchen that'll get you. A bubble and squeak chicken.
So yeah, okay, so I'm kind of at... So yeah, it's kind of a draw on this one, Matthew.
Chop a bit of him off?
Yeah, okay, Raiden can like have one leg, do you know what I mean? And then like you have to go sit in the barrel for a while, which has arrived in the courtroom.
Oh my god, I mean that's basically a death sentence. Asking someone with an open leg wound to go and sit in a barrel of human shit. They're gonna die, they're gonna get sick.
What is this podcast? This podcast is like the audio extension of the hangover I'm experiencing. It's like the same thing but in audio form.
That is the verdict, I'm afraid. If you like, we can flip the order. They can go in the barrel first, then have their leg chopped off.
That's a half and half.
We get to keep the leg. I will display the leg on my little judge table thing. In fact, I'll use it as a hammer.
It's the thoroughness of this that I like.
It's my new gaffel, the leg of this listener. I'm just going to bang it and go, order. And then, yeah, it's sick, but it's going to be a great prop, I think.
Well, that's good. You've now owned the leg of someone called I'm going for a twix.
Again, another in-betweeners character in our Discord. Very good. What are you buying?
Thank you, merchant. Exhibit L is from Craft Cheese. They say that this is their only ever eBay purchase.
They bought a single copy of the Arkane Collection on PS4, which I ordered as a late Christmas present myself. I have realised that it was supposed to get here in early February and it is now getting dangerously close to May. I have a tracking number.
This feels like you should be complaining to eBay rather than us, but anyway. I have a tracking number, but I can't work out what company it was shipped through, and all the text on the page is in German, which I don't speak.
I dread to do the conversion on this, but I spent 40 euros to not receive a collection of games of which I have played all of them at least once on both PS4 and PC. I put myself at the mercy of the wise and noble officers of the court. Why did I include this one?
This is so obviously fucking dead meat.
Yeah, so, I mean, yeah, to address the first point, yeah, this is not eBay, so I would say go ask them about that. That's just their problem, not mine. I'm not legally culpable for that.
You're a wizard, Harry. That was PS1 Hagrid back there. Just said you're a wizard, Harry, out of nowhere.
It's got a few voice lines that just play randomly every now and then. But he said it in a really distorted, cursed kind of way. Yeah, big cursed vibes around PS1 Hagrid.
Yeah, so obviously we are talking about some of the finest games ever made. We're talking about the Dishonored series, and I assume that also includes Prey, Matthew, is that right? That's something a lawyer should do, isn't it?
I didn't assume we'd get that deep into this one, because basically this is someone who just bought a 40 euro copy of it. Isn't that just what it costs?
Yeah, it must be about that. You can always get these games for quite cheap.
Dishonored, Dishonored 2, Dishonored Death of the Outsider and Prey.
Do you get Prey and Moon Crash as well? Okay, let's just move on. So these are obviously damn fine first person games, immersive sims and more shooters in the case of Prey.
I like them a lot, but yeah, if you've already played them and purchased them, why do you need a physical copy of them? It's not like this is like one of those nice limited run sets where you get Corvo's mask or something. It's just a fucking box with a game in it that you played.
So yeah, dead meat.
Oh, great.
Have fun in PlayStation Home. Yeah, that's good news for me.
Exhibit M, this is from Sam. I recently got an Xbox Series X, mostly so I could buy an old 360 games to relive that generation. You may have spotted that the MGS HD collection is no longer on sale on the digital storefront because the license has expired on some historical archive footage used in the games, so I figured I should pick up a disc copy in case they never get round to renewing it.
That's 25 euros for two out and out classics plus Peace Walker, which I always felt was a little overrated. You're not making a good case for yourself. From memory, the level is pretty small and uninspiring.
Then there's also two euro fifty for Far Cry 2. I actually already own this digitally, but this has a nice quality map and set of instructions inside and I wanted a hard copy of my favourite game of all time. I concede it may not be the best game ever made, but Count Me is one of the diehards who was absolutely engrossed in Far Cry 2 when it released, and I wouldn't change a thing about it.
This was my version of an immersive sim before Far Cry introduced crazy skill trees, assassination animations, and inventory management. Just a man and his rapidly degrading weapon against literally every NPC in Africa. Loved it.
So that's my submission. I may be playing with fire, but I reckon I'm relatively safe.
Good playing with fire is a fun little gag there because you can set fire to things in Far Cry 2, of course. That's one of its signature features. Yeah, so Far Cry 2 was like a lightning rod for annoying assholes who pretended other first-person shooters were juvenile and this was the only good one, and that was annoying.
That was annoying, having been there. But it is a singular game, and actually modern Ubisoft would never make a game like that, I don't think. Far Cry now is barely the same series as this, I would argue.
It's completely detached, just a big open world, sort of like shaking a jar of ants, basically, and then sort of like seeing what nonsense happens. It's not really systems in a way that I think is that fun. But it's fine, it's nice looking worlds and fun shooting and stuff.
I just think that Far Cry 2 is very much its own beast. So that's fine, no worries with that one. Even if you played it before, 250 is nothing, that's less than a sandwich, that is, it's nothing.
Metal Gear, yeah, I can see the sort of advantage of this. Yeah, it's true, it's a bummer that they're taking it off sale. I have a digital copy and a physical copy.
So while I'm in theory against buying the same game twice, I think you can't fuck about with Metal Gear because you can't be sure that Konami's got your best interests at heart. So yeah, I think not guilty for this one. But because they did buy the same game twice, two times, they do have to go and sit in the barrel for about 30 minutes.
Okay, a little bit of barrel time, but I'm still putting that down as not guilty.
Yeah, not guilty, I will warn though, Johnny has been shitting the barrel again.
Oh, with a person inside it?
They left first, let's not get too scatological here. The previous person moved on, then he shat in the barrel, now he's left again.
That's all I wanted was to establish the timeline.
One person in the barrel at a time, that's the rule on Samuel Roberts Peninsula.
Well, that's, I mean, my god, that's a brilliant rule, I should introduce that on Matthew Castle Island.
Yeah, just to give people an update by the way, the ore truck from Red Alert is trying to run over Tingle from Zelda. But the ore truck is very tiny, so Tingle has fought it off with no real trouble.
Fantastic, thank you for the update, Judge.
No worries.
Exhibit N is from Jashida. This one is one of these, it's just a list of games and prices.
Well, that's what this court is for, frankly. It's not this...
Okay, this is what you want.
Yeah, this is not fucking performance art, do you know what I mean?
We'll go through them one by one, you can just be like, yes, no, and we'll see if we hit anything too egregious. Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, 25 quid.
Has fucking everyone been buying Metal Gear Solid HD Collection? Yes, that's fine, that's fine.
Kid Icarus Uprising with stand for 40 quid.
The stand makes me want to say no, because the stand...
You get more for your money.
But the stand is one of the most cursed items ever produced by Nintendo. Imagine your control scheme, it's so bad you need to invent a peripheral for a hand-held device and all of people to play it.
We're not putting the stand on trial, that's Sakurai's doing. Do you really want to put Sakurai on trial? He's the internet's favourite.
No, he's a good guy. I think 40 quid is okay for Kid Icarus Uprising. It's weirdly collectible, because you never put it on one of those Nintendo Select series that you can get for 15 quid.
It's always kept its value, this one. So, yeah. Particularly because it comes with those little cards for the scanning.
But, yeah, that's fine. That's okay, too.
Orange Box, 15 quid, 360 version.
Oh, good save. It's PS3, you'd be dead. But 360 was a perfectly fine version.
It's backwards compatible, yes.
Fear 2 Project Origin, 4 quid.
Bad game. Well, not bad game, just not as good as the first one. But 4 quid's nothing, that's fine.
That's still less, and I would spend on a sandwich.
I'm feeling hopeful about this one then. Binary Domain, 8 quid.
Yeah, I think that's fine too. I've been looking at this one. It's 10 quid to buy digitally, so that's a good price.
I've not played the game, but you know, everyone says this is a big Chris Schilling favourite, and Scribs likes it too. There's a lot of love for Binary Domain, so I'm happy to let it go.
That's a good character witness there from Chris Schilling for this person.
Friends of the Pod who have been besmirched by being brought up in a Games Court episode.
They'll send us strongly worded DMs afterwards, going, please don't talk about us in your dogshit podcast.
Take down notices from their lawyers.
So if you heard a beat just then, that's what happened. Pokémon Omega Ruby, 30 quid.
Nah, I think that's too much. What are you doing buying old Pokémon games?
I can never remember which ones are these.
Because the DS era ones are worth shitloads.
Platinum is worth mega bucks.
Platinum has got stuff in it that even the remakes that they did don't have. Well done Nintendo. Why wouldn't you just make the most comprehensive version possible?
This is the one that came out on 3DS after X and Y.
I think the Nintendo mags shut by the time this came out.
These were the GBA ones we made. I'm going to say no, 30 quid is a lot for that. There are so many more recent Pokemon games.
I don't think you can be getting caught up on playing the old ones. I have no nostalgia for Ruby and Sapphire.
You should just borrow that other person's jailbroken 2DS and play it.
And Dragon Quest Monsters 3 Professional. You can enjoy those two games and no more games.
Red Faction Guerrilla, 8 quid.
So I love this game, but I think that's too high a price for it. I got it on Switch the other day for, I think, £2.99. And that's a more modern, it's a remaster.
It's a very bare-bones remaster. It's nothing to get excited about.
It's remastered with the Mars, isn't it?
Yeah, somehow THQ Nordic has got the re-reckoning for Kingdoms of Amalur. And I think SpongeBob Rehydrated, or whatever it was they did.
That's like what we would do if we were actually in charge of game levels.
Yeah, exactly. That's going to be guilty for that one.
What about Spec Ops The Line for £5?
Yeah, you know, great game. You can only get this for less than that in the Xbox sell, but it's not much in it. £5 is still less than I would spend on a sandwich, so that's fine.
Yeah. Darkness 2, this is the last one. Darkness 2 for £5.
Yeah, again, this is an interesting game. This is a more out-and-out fun shooter than the original Darkness was, which is a little bit more tactical. You had these limited...
These powers are quite limited in their ability. You had to play it more stealthily because you couldn't really win an all-out firefight. This one, which is made by Digital Extremes, they just were like, what if those tentacle lamps on your shoulders could basically be like Doc Ock tentacles in Spider-Man?
They could just whip dudes and slice through them and shit. The game delivers on that. It's very short.
It has two endings. One terrible ending that's in the Darkness lore that's absolutely rubbish, and then one very good bad ending where you're basically in an asylum dancing with the nurse there, and it's really quite haunting. A bit of a spoiler there, but who cares?
It's an 11-year-old game. You should have played it by now. No one cares about the Darkness anyway.
Yep, that's fine with me, Matthew. I like the Darkness too. It's good.
So really, aside from Red Faction and Pokemon Omega Ruby, you are kind of into this collection of games.
Yeah, I was actually hoping for more peril, to be honest. What you want in Games Court is three great games and one bullshit game like, oh, I've got Imagine Horses on DS for 58 quid.
But you can't manufacture this drama. These are real people with real games purchases. That's what we want on this podcast.
So yeah, not guilty.
OK, fantastic. What was that from The Merchant?
What are you buying?
That's right. Exhibit O. It's just from Treesmith.
I present to the Honourable Judge my purchase of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 on PS4 from CEX for £35. Ooh.
So this is the one based on the Andrew Garfield film, yeah?
Now, I know this seems expensive for a game with a 53 rating on Open Critic, but it's the latest addition to my collection of Marvel games and from what I understand, one of the harder ones to get hold of with many people asking for double what I paid. It does come with the caveat that the case for it wasn't in the best condition, so I'll probably buy a copy of FIFA 17 or something like that for a charity shop from 19OP to swap the cases. I have every intention of playing it as I usually get a kick out of superhero games and the price was offset by trading in the rubbish Pokémon Brilliant Diamond for £20, so it wasn't that expensive overall.
Except that game, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond would have been like £50 on Switch anyway. So yeah, Amazing Spider-Man 2, £35. I looked up this thing about how much it actually goes for and I found mint-conditioned brand new copies for 30 quid and loads of pre-owned copies for low 20s.
I didn't want to share that, but I felt like I had to in the name of honesty.
Yeah, so I think I know a fair amount about the Spider-Man games generally. I followed them very closely over the years. The one that would get you a not guilty verdict on Samuel Roberts Peninsula.
Oh, that's a spoiler alert for what's about to happen. If you'd said this, you'd be alive.
Yeah. What are you selling? Don't know why I said that.
Yeah. Thank you. Don't know why I said that either.
Maybe someone's buying stuff. I don't know. Maybe it's like nuclear gandis acquiring some firearms from the merchant.
If these people seem to be just saying stuff out loud, they could just be talking to a Kamon and Conquer soldier we can't see.
Yeah, that is very possible.
So maybe he's buying something from Tanya.
More of my appliances have turned Soviet, by the way. It's rough in my kitchen at the moment. Food mixer's just like red now and just like pro-Stalin.
It's rough in there. So, yeah, okay. So Spider-Man games.
This is like these games. I played the original Amazing Spider-Man game, and I think this was kind of like a reskin of that. Basically the same thing.
Like had an okay-looking New York in it. Just quite, you know, bland. But then, in a world where the Insomniac games exist, I don't think there's any real need to go poking around old Spider-Man games.
Like we sort of... I don't know, there's not much value in excavating them. Probably Shattered Dimensions is the one that would get you a not guilty verdict on this island.
That was like the one that kind of introduced the Spider-Verse concept, really. And that goes for a lot of money. Also interesting is Web of Shadows?
Maybe that's not the one, actually. Yeah, I think it is Web of Shadows, actually. It's one where you get Venom powers.
It came out in 2008, the Treyarch made. That's kind of interesting and also goes to quite high price because you can't get it digitally anymore. These would have been better purchases.
Instead, you've overpaid for a shit Spider-Man game. And guilty, frankly. You know what I mean?
That's what Raiden is for. That's what PlayStation Home is for. That's for this sort of thing.
Take him out back, cut him up, get him uploaded to PlayStation Home immediately.
I love the idea of a judge justifying a death sentence. Do you know what I mean? It's like they normally have to explain their quite complicated thinking behind this quite grand move that they're making.
Do you know what I mean? It's got that feel to it.
It's got that feel of let's take this man's life, you know?
I've been noodling it. Okay, good.
Sorry about that, TreeSwerve. I should have defended it better rather than telling everyone how much these games actually go for.
This is like me helping you with your draft picks, but in reverse.
We just tagged Team Demand to death.
We should high five afterwards at the courtroom and baffle everyone.
Classic defence judge tactic. Exhibit P from Ryan Plugs. I recently spent £8 on a sealed copy of Face Training for the DSi so I could use the included cardboard stand for when I was playing through the Ace Attorney games again.
I don't know this cardboard stand. I might need to research it, actually.
Face Training was a DSi game. It used the camera to scan your face and then you did face stretching things to try and keep your skin looking youthful was the idea. The Japanese version came with a really nice plastic stand that I had on my desk for years because it came out in Japan way before it came out in the UK.
It had a plastic stand. Not super obnoxious like the way you had to put the 3DS in or anything for Kid Icarus. It was more like for holding a book up.
It was for holding it in the book position, if you can imagine that. So the hotel dusk position basically. Which actually doesn't make any sense.
Not for Phoenix Wright.
Yeah, he says he's going to use it for Phoenix Wright, where you hold the stand the other way round.
Which I guess you could do. It is just a piece of plastic, but I assume it's calibrated.
Yeah, well this isn't though. The UK version is quite a nasty bit of cardboard, which I didn't want to tell you. But if this was the Japanese one, I'd be like, well that's kind of a curio.
I feel like you could make this out of a cereal box if you were so minded.
Yeah, so I did find the picture of the original, the Japanese one, it did look really nice. It has a little space for your stylus and stuff. I do enjoy a good comedy cardboard peripheral that comes with the game.
See also the Metal Gear Acid 2 3D goggles device you had to put on your PSP and then stick your face on your PSP to see it. Ridiculous. This is just a bit of cardboard for 8 quid.
Quite nasty, as you say. I don't know. Face training has got cursed early 3DS days energy to it.
The 3DS takes a little while to get going. This is the boring bullshit that was dragging it down, I think, so dead for this one.
I wrote of this gaming NGamer after using face training. This writer has not seen a sudden influx of ladies drawn to his Brad Pitt like face. That's for sure.
Has that changed since that review, Matthew?
Well, face training has nothing to do with what's happened to my face since then. That's more to do with I blame it on twixes.
Yeah, OK. That's a diet related matter, not a 3DS game related matter. OK, yeah, so guilty.
What are you buying?
Is that to the court or Tanya?
That's to the court. By the way, nuclear Gandhi has kind of taken out most of like Canada and Alaska at this point. So there may be some consequences to that, a bit of fallout.
We'll see how it goes. But yeah, it's rough.
Currently got an 8 to 7 guilty to not guilty. OK, it's getting a bit spicy. Exhibit Q.
This is our second to last one. This is from personal Nadir. I present to the Honorable Judge my recent Game Boy splurge.
After spending £10.53 on replacement parts and £5.49 on a screwdriver to get my Game Boy working again, I became possessed by the desire to try classic games that passed me by. When I was a child, my selection was entirely decided by how cool the box art looked and what the local toy shop had in stock. Now I can be solely guided by internet lists.
With that in mind, here are my purchases. All came without a case or box. So he bought a cluster for £35.74.
This was just obviously one eBay lot, which came with Metroid II Return of Samus, Tetris, Space Invaders and Mortal Kombat for £35.74. And then he also bought James Bond 007 for £11.85.
Oh, interesting. So, go on.
I feel like, in the name of honesty, I have to say, Mortal Kombat is largely held as one of the worst Game Boy games. I found quite a funny quote from a Nintendo Life review, which gave it 1 out of 10, which said, At a time of release, Nintendo frowned upon ripping people's spines out, so developers replaced the more gruesome finishing moves. Former Batbone Collector Sub-Zero now simply punches his opponent.
Worst fatality ever.
I mean, punch is still pretty bad, but yeah, I can see why that removes the USP. I mean, I wouldn't even know how to begin getting a beat-em-up not-looking shit on a Game Boy. Like, what were they thinking?
Yeah, also, like, if you did the button inputs too fast, you didn't recognize them, you had to do your combos slowly for it to register them.
You know what, though? So we have Metroid 2 and we have Tetris. What was the other game?
Space Invaders.
I see that would work okay on a Game Boy.
Yeah, I mean, Space Invaders.
Basic, basic ass game, yeah. So, and, you know, it's tough because it's like, am I judging that as a bundle or, like, all of it together? I suppose it's all of it together.
And, like, James Bond 007, we have discussed it on this podcast before, but this is basically like a Zelda ripoff, but a really good one. It's like, you know, it takes you to... It kind of, like, mixes in a variety of sort of, like, Roger Moore, Sean Connery era Bond villains and locations and stuff, but it's a little bit fun and silly.
You know, it's a great curio, I would say. Well worth it for 11 quid. So I think that's such a good purchase.
I'm probably going to say not guilty. I'm not... I was experienced with Metroid II, but isn't that, like, can't you just play that on 3DS?
Is there a new 3DS?
Yeah, Metroid II has been... Yeah, that's the one that was remade as... Yeah, Samus Returns on 3DS.
There was also that... I don't know if you can still play it, but there was, like, a fan-made remake of this.
Oh, yeah, it's like A2M or something like that. Yeah, which is quite highly thought of. A2M stands for arse to mouth, doesn't it?
I'm gonna find out what that's called, because, yeah.
I thought it was like another Metroid 2. It's not AM-2R?
Yeah, there you go. I was close. Not A2M, it's AM-2R.
Rather than Aster Mouth Redux.
Very good. Yeah, this was remade, and I think it was tough, because I think it got, I think the 3DS one got bashed by comparison a little bit, because this one, I think, basically used the Zero Mission sprites and visual style. So, you know, that's tough.
That is a very nice visual style, and it was like that sort of 3D they were going for with the 3DS one, right? It was a fully 3D game that just happened to be 3D.
Yeah, like a proto Metroid Dread.
Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, there were two remakes there. So, yeah, would you...
Such a stupid error to make. Yeah, Tetris. Would you ever play Game Boy Tetris?
You know, like there's so many ways to play Tetris. I don't know, like, I just play.
I feel like there was a point where actually Game Boy Tetris still was the best Tetris for a very long time. But today, like, it's just not true anymore. You know, you'd play Tetris Effect or...
Tetris 99.
Yeah, exactly. I think in this day and age, but...
Yeah, the DS version of Tetris is great, too.
He does add to this, I confess I bought the Mortal Kombat collection purely for Metroid with the hope of selling the others on. This hasn't happened yet. Please release me from this island without time so I could rip myself of Mortal Kombat.
It is utterly unplayable. So they're a little bit of a, you know, another kind of hurt me, hurt me judge type thing. Yeah.
So the first bundle of games doesn't really inspire me. But James Bond, oh.
It's, I, yeah, I know what you mean. Like I've got a lot of fondness for this too. I think, I think that, like, I actually think genuinely good Game Boy Curios are sort of few and far between.
I think a lot of these games you go back to and they're absolutely rank. But that one I think is, holds up.
Yeah, I agree with you. Like when you look at how much shovelware was in the Game Boy library, it's like fucking unbelievable amount of shit maybe times and stuff. Yeah, okay.
God, I'm gonna say not guilty for James Bond. And also, one bad game out of a bundle for like 35 quid, it's not so bad. Like I wouldn't be hurting too much having got a Metroid and Tetris out of it.
I do question how much you would play those games.
Yeah.
And Space Invaders. Who's never need to ever play Space Invaders? Just play Super Stardust or something.
There's way better versions of that to be played now.
Yeah, because Metroid 2 is on like 3DS Virtual Console as well. But you've said not guilty now.
I partly wanted to create a bit of drama for this final one because it's like this, it rests on the last one, doesn't it? Isn't that how it is?
It does, yes. Yes, we are 8.5 guilty, 8.5 not guilty. That's because you've got someone's leg or someone's sitting in a barrel of shit with no wound or something.
Yeah, okay, good. Yeah, we don't have that.
I like the idea that that person's head is sticking out the top of the barrel and they're still watching everything, very engaged by it.
And I'm watching a man just brandish a leg at a courtroom. Yeah, okay, good. Wasn't someone gonna be uploaded into Digital Hagrid as well to PS1 Hagrid?
Oh yeah, someone has been uploaded into Digital Hagrid. That was Slot Rocket.
Yeah, oh yeah, now I remember, yeah, good stuff. Go on, last one.
So this is the final exhibit. Exhibit R from The Great Beard of Wisdom. It's a bit of a long one, it's a bit of a complicated one.
I have been systematically buying every Silent Hill game on eBay for the last nine months, each of them seemingly going up in price. It's gone in this order. I'm going to read you through the order and the prices, and then I'll finish the letter and we can go back through it, okay?
Silent Hill Homecoming, 20 pounds. Silent Hill Downpour, 35 pounds. Silent Hill 3, 35 pounds.
Silent Hill 2, 40 pounds. Silent Hill, the original, 60 pounds. Silent Hill Book of Memories, 60 pounds.
Silent Hill Origins, 64 pounds. Silent Hill Shattered Memories, still sealed, 200 pounds. Right, and I'll read the justification.
My reasons for these purchases, this is sort of hilariously mercenary, I love this. My reasons for these purchases are that I have never played any of the games post Team Silent and wanted to experience them firsthand with an intent to sell them on as a collection in the future, as I feel they are very sought after. Ironically, I will not be able to play Book of Memories as I do not own a Vita.
So this purchase is literally to complete the set. So that's 60 pounds he spent on that one. I'm hoping this series of exhibits will result in a lenient sentencing, given the balance of caliber when it comes to good games versus bad games on display.
But if either judge feels a harsher sentence is required due to the intent to profit from them in future, coupled with the knowledge that shattered memories will not be played, but watched on YouTube, so as to keep the seal intact, then I would ask that I be pulped after my eBay selling, so at least I can enjoy the profit, take my profits with me. Truth be told, I'm not a wine drinker, so you could easily pull a wool over my eyes with a cheap Merlot from Sainsbury's and I wouldn't know any difference. So, yeah, so lots to unpack here.
He's building a collection to sell it. He spent 200 pounds on a game he's now watching on YouTube rather than playing. And he spent a lot of money.
Yeah, first of all, not enough cash, stranger.
Oh, there he is. I'm glad he's waiting on it.
Yeah, yeah, so, okay, like, I feel like we've got to the sort of final form of the people who are in our Discord who are like, I just spent way too much money on X thing. Did I make a mistake? Because I was fascinated about this one weirdo game from the past.
This is like the final form of that. Yeah, this is tough. So I am going to need you to go through the prices again, and then I'm going to assign like a yes or no to them, and then we'll tally them up at the end, yeah?
Okay, Silent Hill Homecoming, £20.
That still seems high, but I'm going to allow that because it's not that bad compared to some of the other ones.
Also, he set out specifically to play the post-Team Silent ones, so that ticks that box.
Yeah, it does, but is that a good idea? It's a larger question.
I mean, it is a weird project to work on.
Yeah, this is notoriously a series that peaked with the Team Silent entries, so to go afterwards is bold. Yeah, but that's not too bad compared to some of the other ones.
Silent Hill Downpour, 35.
That's just too high, I think. This game isn't quite as bad as people say it is. It's interesting, it has some interesting bits to it.
Weirdly, lots of melee combat, that's kind of strange. Yeah, I think if you got this at under 20 quid, it'd be a good curio, but I'm not sure I can have that.
Silent Hill 3, 35 pounds.
Well, that is a Team Silent one. So, that's fine. Do you know what?
The PS2 sort of original Silent Hill games are like out of control price-wise, because basically every time a horror YouTuber does a video on them, people are just like, I have to play this mythical horror game. And this happens over and over again, so now these prices are out of control. So that's okay, because I don't think it's a good price, good game, the HD Collection 1 isn't acceptable, so that's okay.
Silent Hill 2, 40 pounds.
Yep, again, same as before, that's okay. Yeah, Silent Hill 2, all-time classic, still not bettered in its original form.
The original Silent Hill, 60 quid.
I don't really like the original Silent Hill, I thought it was hard work when I played it again. I would say this should have just been bought for 8 quid on PS Vita. They should be buying a physical copy of this, that's too much, I think.
Okay, Silent Hill Book of Memories, 60 quid.
This is the one they can't play on PS Vita, it's meant to be quite bad. So, yeah, guilty for this one, for sure.
Silent Hill Origins, I don't even remember this one, 64 pounds.
Yeah, it's like a big crop of these. I think this one came out on, I think, PSP and PS2. Yeah, I don't know that much about it.
Yeah, I think 60 quid is a lot for this. I don't know, I'm actually going to abstain on that one because I don't know enough about it to make a decision. So yeah, abstaining on that one.
So you're into three of them, you're not into three of them, one you're abstaining on, so it really comes down to whether or not you think spending 200 quid on a sealed copy of Silent Hill Shattered Memories is a wise move.
That you're not even going to play. That was your downfall, I'm afraid. Like, I bought a copy of this for about 40 quid, I think, on Wii, which I think was fine for what it is.
But 200 quid, and you're not even going to play it? I mean, come on, man. Like, just, you know, try a bit harder, I say.
Yeah, this is...
That is so much money.
That's so much money. For a game that's, like, interesting, but its reputation is overblown a little bit relative to what it is, Matthew. Do you think that's probably fair to say about...
100%. I think this is quite an overrated Silent Hill. Like, I think it's fundamentally, like, not effective as a horror game in any way.
Yeah, you explain why.
Which is a huge mark against it for this series.
Yeah, it's like, it's not... I mean, when people describe the cool bits of it, they are basically talking about the little narrative wraparounds that let you affect different parts of the game in interesting ways, and they are cool, but then it's kind of bookended by all these boring chasers through very cheap-looking environments, I think. So, yeah, I don't think it's as interesting as people say.
It's definitely not in the league of Sunhill 2 and 3. That's the other thing about Shadow of Memories. 2 and 3 are all-time classics.
They don't feel like they're compromised in any way. They look amazing, sound amazing, but yeah, this is not a game you need to buy for £200, I would say.
Well, that sounds like you're adding it up to guilty here.
Yeah, I think so. That's all of them, right? It's not somehow like eight more Silent Hill games I've never heard of.
No, that's a lot of them.
Yeah, see, I think if you just paid more sensible prices for some of this and had more of an intent to play them rather than just look at them and then sell them, that's some landlord shit right there, do you know what I mean?
I'd love to know if this collection actually does make a profit. Off the top of my head, you're looking at about £400. Would you pay £400 plus for a complete Silent Hill collection?
That might be true in a few years, you know, if the series comes back in some form or something. That might add up, but will you find someone as daft as you to spend £200 plus on a sealed copy of Shattered Memories? I'm not banking on it, do you know what I mean?
That's a big gamble, you know what I mean? This is probably a Patreon backer, because if you're ill-advised at least spending your money on Silent Hill games, you'd probably back the Patreon, which I appreciate. I would almost let them off on that alone, but slice them up, get them in PlayStation Home, leave them there forever, or at least until the PS3 breaks.
What a shocking turn of events. By my calculation, that is nine and a half guilty to eight and a half not guilty.
Okay, I am going to make a late decision here and let that guy have his leg back. It's a bit worse for wear, I'll be honest. I'm going to undo that half and do a bit of leniency, because the sheer madness of 200 pounds and shattered memories has recontextualized that purchase somewhat.
So the leg is his once more, whoever that was. Real judges can't do that.
They can't go like, oh man, I thought that guy's murder was bad, but you, sir, your murder was so bad that actually what he did was no longer murder.
Answer me this though, Matthew. Do real courtrooms have the inventor of PlayStation, Nuclear Gandy and PS1 hand grid in them?
They do with the right case. And it's a case I would love to see. That is the trial of the century you just described there.
Yeah, okay, good.
By the way, that makes it by my count, nine all.
Yeah, by the way, the barrel is now turned Soviet as well. Some engineers got in there. Don't know what they're going to do with it.
Not my problem, frankly. But yeah.
Share it out equally. Everyone gets an equal amount of shit from the world.
Okay, good. And so yeah, the San Roberts Peninsula is also being annexed once more by the people of Indonesia. So we're going to have to get out of here now, I think.
It's tough for this civilization. Okay, good. So even Stevens then, Matthew.
Clean down the middle.
Well, it's not clean because it's a barrel of shit, but nothing clean about it, frankly.
You're quite right. I enjoyed those collection of games. I thought there were a lot of interesting ones.
I think you're right, though. I think we need to recalibrate and get some more. Give us some old fashioned games and prices.
Yeah, so I bought the second hand game for this amount of money. That's basically what GameScore is.
We don't want you to judge your soul or something you did. I bought Sonic Adventure for £8 and I also hit a man in my car once. We're not interested in the car bit.
Just the Sonic Adventure bit.
Yeah, exactly. I didn't need all that coming of age shit in the New Super Mario Bros. 2 one.
You know what I mean? This isn't Adventureland. We're not here for this.
This isn't Adventureland.
I don't know why I mentioned that film of all them. So, yeah, it's... So, yeah, go to Games Court Submissions on the Discord.
You can find the Discord link in our Twitter bio. If you go in there, you can submit entries for future Games Court. Next time, Matthew will be the judge once more, and I will be the lawyer.
I will not be hungover next time either. That will be a little bonus to account for.
And your throat will not be scratched by an egg.
Yeah, exactly. I will lose my sexy Kathleen Turner voice.
Kathleen Turner egg voice.
Let's get out of this courtroom before we catamaried Matthew, another successful running Games Court.
Yeah, let's do it.
All right, good. So this podcast is over. Thank God, frankly.
It's episode.
Yeah, this episode is over. Thank you so much for your support on Patreon, patreon.com/backpagepod for those who are not signed up. We do two extra podcasts a month on there.
One is about games, one is about pop culture. We have just this week actually released our best TV shows of the century pod, which is almost three hours long. Really long episode where we go through a bunch of TV we like.
I would say that our level of chat about TV is definitely on par with our chat about games. What do you say, Matthew, in terms of baiting experience and things to say?
Hopefully, yeah.
Yeah, it's a bit different for us, but we really enjoyed it. Next up for the XL episode for patrons, it's going to be the Top Metal Gear Moments. We're doing that in July.
That'll be fun. I think we're probably going to do a second part of the TV shows in July as well, Matthew, for the other XXL episodes. Plenty to look forward to on there.
£4.50 for the XL tier gets you that. It does add tax on top of that. Sorry about that.
Can't control tax, unfortunately, only on Samuel Roberts Peninsula. We're Back Page Pod on Twitter. Matthew, where can people find you?
At MrBattle Underscore Pest Day.
I'm Samuel Dobie Roberts, and see you next week for something or other.
