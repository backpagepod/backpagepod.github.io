Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined, as ever, by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. It's been a little while since we did a podcast together. Feels like three weeks, but that can't be possible.
It must be two weeks. How's it going? Wanna talk about the sandwich situation at Noy's Kitchen in Bath?
I feel like the listeners deserve an update on the old sandwich situation. And this is probably the most interesting development yet, because there is a waiting room when you buy a sandwich from this particular place that has very cursed energy. Would you say that's correct?
Yeah, that's right. I went to this place, Noy's Kitchen. I keep saying Noy's Kitchen.
The way I said it there sounded like this is a promotion with sponsors. It really isn't. Not after what we're about to say about this weird room.
They wouldn't want that. I went there to buy Catherine a Ban Mee sandwich. I believe that's how it's pronounced.
I don't really like this sandwich because it's got a lot of pate in it. I hate pate. So I was just going for Catherine.
So that's, you know, good points for me in this anecdote. And yeah, you buy it. And because it's normally a restaurant at lunchtime, they don't want like a load of weird hungry blokes sort of shuffling around in the main restaurant.
So they make you sit in this strange room through a door, which, you know, they don't normally let you through. And you end up in there with a load of shifty men. And it feels like something bad is going to go down in there.
It feels like you're there for a nefarious purpose. Yeah.
I mean, when I went there, it was like, I think it was two blokes, then one bloke left, and another bloke was still sat there. And it does have the weird air of, like, is a doctor about to touch my balls kind of energy to it. Just a bit like, because it's exclusively blokes.
And everyone knows they're not allowed in the main restaurant bit because they've bought a sandwich and not like a sit down meal.
So that feels like naughty. It feels like you've done something wrong.
It does. Yeah. Which I will point out, Noya's Kitchen, Vietnamese place and bath, fucking amazing restaurant.
Like genuinely, probably my favorite place and bath. I love it. And I appreciate them moving into a new area of business, particularly the sandwich genre, which is very much a key, you know, a key sort of like situation for myself and Matthew.
And so, yeah, weirdly though, there is like a Barn Me kind of like war going on, I feel. This feels like Shots Fired from Milk Bun Deli, another excellent sandwich shop that's across Bath. And they do a Barn Me.
And now there are more places that do this sandwich I hadn't even heard of two years ago, versus like a smoked salmon cream cheese sandwich. You can't even get that in like more than one place in Bath. But somehow the fucking Barn Me is a battleground.
Like, I mean, these are very granular sandwich updates, Matthew. But I feel they were, I feel they're important to discuss, you know.
As a non-patator, it's such a futile war. I'm just by the sideline shaking my head sadly at all of this. You do you.
Yeah, I mean, I will buy another one. If I see a woman in that waiting room, I will report back. That's my promise to you and the podcast listeners, Matthew.
But I don't think it's ever going to happen, to be honest. I've got a weird feeling it's always going to be men in that room.
It's like the sandwich version of The Red Room from Twin Pinks.
Yeah, I mean, it's not quite as cursed as that, you know? There's no sort of like, there's no one's talking backwards in there, you know? There's not like a little man.
Killer Bob's not in there, as far as I know. Killer Bob has not been spotted in the Bath region. But nonetheless, Matthew, I sort of see what you're going for there.
Maybe it will become more cursed as I go. Yeah, okay, good. Something to look forward to, maybe.
All right, so, this, sorry, I was just starting to come up with Twin Peaks and Bath Crossovers, but that's not what this podcast is about. That could be saved for another time. No doubt we'll discuss Twin Peaks at some point on the XXL episodes, Matthew.
So, it has been a while since we've podded. The Nintendo Switch 2 has released, apparently sold 3.5 million units at launch. That's basically as many as I think they made available.
So a pretty decent sort of kickoff for the Switch 2. A lot of demand for it, clearly. And, you know, it's been sort of a massive eight years since the last Nintendo hardware release.
So I think that pent-up demand makes sense. It has launched with Mario Kart World. I almost forgot the name of it there.
That's how SGF has done a number on my brain, flying back and forth to LA. And also Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, of course. Those are the first party games.
And then on the third party front, I would describe it as a selection of third party ports that feels curated the initial launch line-up to me. Do you think that's fair, Matthew?
There's some talk about who did and didn't get access to it. You know, some quite mainstream indies are like, you know, we would have been there day one with a shiny version of, you know, a Switch 2 version of our hit game if we'd had the option. So, you know, I imagine it'll come out over time, like, who was and wasn't invited, but yeah, I'd say it's quite a good cross-section of genres.
A lot of developers represented there, a lot of, you know, some interesting games which weren't on the Switch 1, some games which have, like, never really been in the Nintendo ecosystem before. So, yeah, having covered many console launches for Nintendo, it feels like one of the healthier ones to me.
Yeah, I think there's mostly good taste in the selection of ports that have arrived at launch. It doesn't sound like all of them are winners, but it sounds like Cyberpunk is a winner. We'll discuss Cyberpunk on this episode because Matthew's been playing it.
It's very sad to hear that apparently Hitman is not up to scratch on the Switch 2, which is gutting because I think that's like, if you get Hitman, that whole World of Assassination trilogy working on there, basically more or less on par with the Steam Deck version, which is great. What a fucking game changer that is. The idea that they've kind of bungled it, bit disappointing.
Do you hear that as well?
Yes. I mean, I've been watching footage of it online and it looks good. Visual quality wise, it's pretty nice.
It's just very, very patchy. Frame rate wise, apparently. Though in handheld, the slightly more variable frame rate of the screen means that it's not as violently felt, but on TV it's a little bit choppy and not entirely pleasant.
But yeah, still trying to get hold of that one to test, so.
That's tough. Fortunately, Matthew's favourite game of all time, Hogwarts Legacy, is also available on Switch 2, so that's good. And Civ and some other ports I'm not interested in, but...
I downloaded a demo of Street Fighter 6, that's how Kino was to test everything. It's the only Switch 2 game with a demo that I could see.
Did Capcom send us Street Fighter codes like two years ago?
We did.
We did.
Capcom are listening, I'm so sorry.
We didn't even fucking play it. That's so rude that, isn't it?
I did play it. I'm so bad at it. I had nothing to contribute about it, other than I like the art style of it and the character design is nice, but I'm just so bad at those games.
That's tough. So you did play the demo on Switch 2?
Yeah, I thought it looked very nice. Again, it took me back to the 3DS launch, which obviously had Street Fighter 4 on it. And that seemed like a little bit of a miracle port back in the day to suddenly have this game which wasn't on the Wii running all bells and whistles on the 3DS.
So it was kind of history repeating a little bit. But yeah, it looked nice.
Yeah, absolutely.
Says Digital Foundry, competitor Matthew Castle.
Moving in on their turf. He said the word variable earlier as well. Variable, that sounds like a real thing.
I'm very impressed.
I've learned a lot about how consoles work now from the Switch 2 welcome tour. So I'm actually pretty clued up on this stuff.
Yeah, you've read 18 different pages on fucking HD Rumble 2 or whatever it's called. That's very exciting for you. Okay, Matthew, so these are not your first impressions of the Switch 2.
We discussed that on an episode about a month ago when you went to the Switch event in London. However, you have it in your hands now, we both have Switch 2s. And I wanted to talk a bit about the form factor because it is a larger screen than the original Switch.
I actually took my Steam Deck out of its case and popped the Switch 2 into the Steam Deck case, which it fit in quite nicely actually. And then just took that with me in lieu of having a proper case for it. Because I think the Horrie case this time is a fucking like little bag, a little Warhammer bag basically.
You put your Switch, it's just ridiculous. I just want the little, the hard case with the zip, which is exactly what I have for the Switch, a beautiful thing. And they've absolutely fucked it, which is disappointing.
However, it will come, I'm sure.
Yeah, I'm sure. But why is it a little fucking, it looks like a little bag you give your kid when you're divorced, and you're shipping your kid back and forth. I just don't think that's...
I don't think they're suggesting that is a replacement for the streamlined carry case. They're like, that's your whole Switch 2 experience. You know, it holds boxes and things like that, and extra controllers and things.
It's more like a, it looks like a kind of cooler, right? Like a little kind of cooling bag.
Yeah, it does. Or like an overnight bag or something.
It's probably got a space for a couple of cans of Pepsi Max in there.
Yeah.
It's got big mini fridge energy, that bag.
Okay. So where was I? Yes.
It's a larger screen. The device, to me, Matthew, feels quite premium in the hand. So I was pretty impressed by it.
When I took it out, I was like, oh, this is actually slightly fancier than I thought it would be. The comparison I made on Blue Sky, apologies to repeat it here. But you know, I'm sure many people have got me muted on Blue Sky for their insanity, is that it reminds me a bit of the leap from the DS Lite to the 3DS original launch model, which had that lovely sort of varnish layer on top and felt very premium to me.
That little 3D slider and stuff felt really nice. And then, you know, the 3DS sort of like models are a bit up and down in terms of their premium feel, I think. But that first model was was absolutely fantastic.
It reminded me of that. It's like this is quite a, you know, you know the form factor, but it's a very deluxe kind of version of the form factor. How did you feel about it?
Relief mainly, because ever since we did the Switch 2 hands on, when I went to that early preview event, you know, I had quite limited time with it, and I was really, really excited. And I kept thinking, you know, was my, you know, praise for this and description of this just influenced by the fact that I was really excited to be playing Switch 2? And, you know, it's been coming closer, you know, we were answering listener questions about it, and people were asking about various, you know, feels and finishes of it.
And I thought, have I actually described it correctly? Or have I just imagined a version of it? You know, I keep every once in a while, true story over the last month, been looking at pictures of it online and footage of people holding it, thinking, have I got this right?
Was this good? Was this, is this nice in the hands? So, yeah, big relief to get out of the box and be like, this is really, like, sturdy.
The thing that jumps out at me this time is, you know, having the Joy-Cons disconnected from it, like, they're just a chunkier size, like, they're more natural in the hands. I was able to play the Switch 1, you know, with the Joy-Con in each hand, but I needed, you know, with some sort of adapting to that. But with this new one, like, they just, they feel like they're finally, you know, the right size for me.
And, yeah, I've been playing in as many different configurations as I can. You know, feels comfortable to me to hold it, the right kind of weight, in hand-held, in tabletop mode, the slightly bigger screen, you know, nicer to look at. You know, if you want to kind of play in that kind of hunched over position in the adverts, it's always like at an airport waiting lounge or on a train or something rather than my coffee table.
So whether or not I've got a good opportunity to play it like that, I don't know, but yeah, good, like feels nice, right weight, I agree with you. I think it feels sort of premium. I think when I played it first, I not predicted but thought that once people had it, they might feel not like, oh, great, I've just spent 400 pounds, but they'd feel kind of a bit better about it.
They wouldn't feel like, oh, I don't see where that money has gone at all. I think that's true. Would you agree?
Yeah, I agree with that. I think it's actually maybe it's just because I've bought so many handhelds in the last few years of varying kinds, and also things like VR headsets that to me this feels, I think basically worth the money on the dot. It's really interesting because obviously Microsoft is now making handheld consoles with Asus, and I'm pretty sure the high-end version of that is going to be close to a grand.
I think that when those come out, I think that's going to recontextualize how people feel about the Switch 2's value a little bit, but maybe the lower end Xbox handheld will be a bit closer to the base Steam Deck, which I think is like $399, the cheapest Steam Deck. But I would say that it's much nicer to hold than the Steam Deck. It's much less of an, you know, the Steam Deck's not ugly, but it doesn't really have portability.
This is sort of like as large as I think you can make a handheld and still call it portable. But I definitely think that the feeling of value is there. It's, yeah, the sort of base unit is lovely.
I agree, the Joy-Cons, the way they click into the magnetic sort of locks on the side of the screen are wonderful. There's like a step up in the feel of it. I would say there's a slight Fisher price elements to the original Switch that this buffs out.
It's just a little bit, it's still a toy, but a little bit less like a toy, you know?
Yeah, I feel like with the original Switch, the OLED model kind of countered some of that. Because the screen felt quite like premium and deluxe on that. That maybe kind of softened some of that original toy-like energy that it had.
And I've been quite used to the OLED, that's what I've been using these last few years.
Yeah, the white Joy-Cons as well I think helped with the OLEDs to make it feel a little bit classier. So I agree with that, but yeah, value-wise, I think it's about there Matthew. And I was like, wow, this is so nice, this is too nice to take out of the house as my first reaction to it really.
Yeah, there is a bit of that. It's going to take me a while to get used to, like I'm quite protective of it when I put it in the dock. You know, I'm very aware of like, oh, I don't want to like scrape this to shit.
Even though I've learned through welcome tour that the dock is very cleverly safety-proofed in lots of different ways. So, you know, really I shouldn't feel any pressure because they've taken a lot of things into consideration. Expert industrial design.
So, peace of mind, worth £7.
Eight pounds, close to eight pounds. If you, by the way, by the end of this episode, Matthew would have saved you eight quid by reciting every bit of text from the welcome tour. So that's extra value.
And I've done impressions of at least five tech demos.
Okay, so let's talk about the actual turning the console on. It's very familiar, the interface. They've already updated the interface on Original Switch.
It reminds me, Matthew, of how when the PS5 came along, it had that lovely new interface, which is still, I will say, it's still slightly confusing. The UI for the PS5, it's got way too much going on on that bottom bar that comes up when you press the button mid-game.
Oh, I don't like that. The game base or whatever it is. No one knows what that bar's called is just like a big indicator of the problem.
Yeah, it's got about nine million options that. Yeah, some games are like, oh yeah, here's a full walkthrough on how to finish them. Some of them don't do that.
The percentage seems to take about fucking 10 hours to update when you're playing a game to tell you how far through it you are. I'm exaggerating there. But my point is the actual like the basic elements of a new PS5 interface, I think wowed us all a little bit in 2020 because it felt new and fresh.
And by contrast, the Xbox interface felt kind of familiar and therefore didn't quite have that feeling of newness, even though the hardware, I really like the Series X. This reminds me a bit of the Series X situation where you kind of know the UI, but I guess what you get to enjoy is the improvements to the speed of things and how they load up. There are some improvements to the eShop as well, Matthew.
You can tell they're doing some very light curation of things on there in terms of spotlighting different types of games. They got more ways to spotlight types of games. They already changed the store charts algorithm to basically punish games that dropped to 99p in order to sell you a clock app and all that curse shit that ruined the eShop over the past, let's face it, six or seven years.
That's in slightly better shape. Obviously, the crucial thing is that eShop is way faster to navigate now. I want to talk about that side of things.
Do you note any other improvements to the UI? Or am I being a bit harsh there by saying it feels incremental rather than revolutionary?
No, I think that's true. It's slotted in. The fact that the first thing you do when you turn it on is transfer your system across is very much like a passing of the baton.
That's kind of an interesting bit of it, actually. Because they introduced those whole virtual game card things, I didn't think they were going to go quite as heavy on move everything across. I thought the virtual game cards were queuing you up for you have a Switch, you have a Switch 2, we're just going to have a nice switching of games between them.
And you can do that. But in truth, I moved everything across, and I don't think I've turned on the Switch 1 in this last week now. So the virtual game cards, I thought were going to be like the cornerstone of the whole Switch ecosystem.
I don't think that is true. Not how they're presenting it as a Switch 2 user. And I agree with you on eShop, very much improved.
Much quicker. I like the fact that you roll over the tiles and it starts playing the little trailer of the game. I think the filters seem much better.
Certainly you can kind of cut out stuff you're not interested in and get straight to the Switch 2 stuff. Yeah, like nothing to kind of set your heart aflame, but just very cleanly, competently done. Would I have liked that Switch transfer to happen with an army of Pikmin carrying Jujops that represent the data of my games?
Sure. You know, I like all that stuff, you know. Did I want to unwrap each game as a little virtual birthday present?
Yeah, of course. Like, who wouldn't? But it also happened in 20 minutes, got me into my Switch 2 games pretty quickly, and like crucially that was fine.
And time to Mario Kart was pretty limited, it was pretty short, you know, from unboxing it to playing. So, yeah, like big tick from me.
Yeah, I largely agree with everything you say there. I think we're pretty much on the same page. In general, it's a console of, you know, improvements.
It's not, it was never pitched as revolutionary, though I too missed the 3DS Store, eShop, Gubbins, Matthew. They were like, they were fun, weren't they? They were nice to unwrap things.
It was a nice feeling.
There's no interface bangers here, you know?
Yeah.
There's no, like, tunes that you're going to dance to. There's definitely not, like, a We Shop song that you're going to be going nuts for.
Picking in a soundtrack draft to vanquish your opponent, you know, nothing like that. So, well, they fruitlessly picked the Smash Bros Ultimate soundtrack and get absolutely fucked into the bin. That was, you know, nothing like that's going to happen.
That's the power of the We Shop channel.
Which was also in the Smash Bros soundtrack, by the way. Anyway, so, yes, I did want to talk about the screen, because I think people were kind of concerned that the OLED had set a high standard that Nintendo was not prepared to meet in this, with the Switch 2, in terms of the price has gone up, obviously, on the system. But the screen is not OLED, it's LCD, is that right?
Digital Foundry, help me out here? Yeah, okay. Yeah.
But it is so much brighter, and I will say that it completely passes the test for me, like I don't have any complaints about it. I'm sure there's some people out there, aficionados, they're like, oh well, with an OLED screen, the blacks are much deeper, which is the sort of thing that men with 4K Blu-ray collections talk about. But I don't really know much about, and I can just say that taking Mario Kart World as a sort of taste test, is immediately a treat for the eyes.
I think it's a great screen. How do you feel about it?
I do like the richness of the Switch OLED. It is definitely a treat, but also your eyes adapt pretty quickly. I don't think it is a huge drop.
Whatever drop there is, you forget about it. You don't have these things side by side. In the context of just holding a Switch 2 in your hands, it quickly begins to make sense.
You like the size of it, the colour of it looks good. I have really no complaints on that count. Weirdly, not so much the handheld mode, but on the TV.
The era we now live in of HDR games is also the era of constantly thinking, have I set up the HDR right on this? And adjusting endless settings in your TV, and seeing if anyone on Reddit has done like a, these are the settings for Switch 2 with your particular brand of TV. Because every TV has a thousand different settings that need to be very specific for the HDR to really sing.
And that to me is like the more frustrating version of having to choose between performance or quality mode in games. In games consoles, I don't really want to be making any decisions. That's kind of what consoles mean to me.
They are the machine that takes those decisions away and just presents itself in the best light. But I'd be lying if I'm saying I haven't been like fucking around with HDR on both the console and the TV for the last couple of nights. Occasionally just like blowing games completely out so they look awful.
Sometimes the colour's completely off. I've got quite an old flat screen TV.
Every game looks like Wind Waker HD on your TV now Matthew. That's how much you've blown out the lighting in it. It's just like fucking everything is white basically.
But no, I've got the sweet spot and I'm liking it crucially. When I play Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom and I'm up in the Cloud Kingdom, those clouds and the sunlight look absolutely amazing. I think Mario Kart World has got some incredibly handsome vistas.
I'm going to stop tweaking and just enjoy, just luxuriate in my incredibly fluffy, bright clouds.
Makes sense, Matthew. I don't really play the Switch on a TV. I think under 1% of my time with the original Switch was spent on the TV.
I would say most of that was in the last year when me and my little brother, Oscar, started playing Super Mario 3D World again in Co-op, and we are having a great time. That was, again, like the battlefront thing, a bit of a test of the old relationship between me and my brother. But very, very fun.
Otherwise, I don't really do that. I definitely see the Switch as an all-handheld thing. I like playing it while lying in bed and that sort of thing, lying on the couch.
It's nice to enjoy it in that form. One observation I did have is that the Switch OLED is heavier than the original Switch. The screen makes it heavier, and I don't think the Switch 2 can afford to be heavier than it is.
That's the other thing I thought. It's actually quite a heavy-feeling device. I don't know if an OLED screen of that size might just make it a touch too heavy.
Am I just being… am my arms too weak? Do I need to hit the gym, Matthew?
We'll have to see if Nintendo start releasing loads of games with motion controls that are subtly pumping up our arms. If there's lots of games where we're just pumping weights and we're like, wait a second, are they quietly preparing us to hold a slightly heavier console in about two years' time? I mean, I love my OLED Switch so much that, sicker that I am, I'm already like all in on OLED Switch 2 if they choose to do it.
But yeah, I definitely have to beef up if that's the case.
It's funny, one day you're just going to sort of look around and go, Catherine, I can't believe it, I'm ripped basically, just from playing Maraka's minigames in Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour.
In Welcome Tour, I've been shaking those Maraka's so much that I'm now the rock.
Yeah, I can't rule out that I'll eventually get another version of this console. The things that would do it for me is that the battery life on the Switch 2 is my number one sort of like negative for it. It feels about as brisk as the Steam Deck's battery life to me.
And coming from the Switch OLED where it felt like it was a bit more, I think because I went from the launch model Switch to the improved battery version of with the OLED, that it feels like a bit, it's a bit of a steep step back, I would say, to what I remember the original Switch feeling like. It feels like about three hours of battery to me when you're playing, if you're playing Mario Kart on it non-stop. It might even be less than that, but it just feels like a percentage is ticking down so fast.
And even in standby, it's absolutely fucking eating power. It's just quite annoying. I thought they might have solved that, actually, like the standby thing.
Why is it fucking chewing through power when it's not doing anything? That's annoying. So the battery, Matthew, is my number one gripe with the console so far.
But how do you feel about it?
Yeah, I mean, I haven't played enough handheld to just get into that as a problem, because I've mostly been playing on the TV, because the games do, you know, Mario Kart World does look amazing on the TV. I think the thing I've played most in handheld was Cyberpunk, and that was pretty heavy duty. I don't think you would get three hours out of that on a Switch 2 charge.
That feels like it's really sucking out that juice. So, yeah, like, that isn't ideal. I don't know, like, when I play my handhelds at home, like, I've often gotten plugged in.
Like, the Steam Deck, you know, if I'm playing it lazily on the couch, it is probably plugged in somewhere while I'm doing it. I do very little proper, like, out and about gaming, like, maybe the odd train ride. But it sounds like you play the, you know, you intend to or will play the Switch 2 a lot more in handheld mode, so you are going to feel the sting of that.
You know, on TV, you're just like, well, you know, I just played 12 hours straight of, you know, different games on launch day or whatever. So, you know, you don't feel it.
Making excuses for Nintendo, classic Matthew Castle.
Well, no, but you know, it is, it is rough. And I didn't actually read much about the battery in The Walking Tour. So I haven't, I haven't got any great insights for you there.
But, you know, the nature of these things, you know, the more powerful you want to be and the smaller the form factor, something's going to give, you know, something's got to actually fuel what's going on and what's happening. You know, do smaller, more powerful batteries exist? Are they, like, three times expensive?
I don't know. You know, you've got to imagine that they've, you know, really gone over every possible combination of innards they can have for this thing and decided that for whatever reason this is the right selection. But, you know, that's too nerdy for Welcome Tour.
So, well, yeah, that's the sort of thing that Valve has discussed with the Steam Deck. And I think they basically said that to get it to the price that they did. They made every decision, you know, like the battery life, that, you know, there are more powerful batteries available, but they made the decision to keep the price where it is basically.
So it's a balance between what you can offer players and what the, yeah, like, and what is actually kind of good value for money. So I imagine that's true. It's just one of those things where I'm, that's where I'm nearly certain they'll be like an upgrade mid-gen when inevitably the price, well, I say the price of things full.
That stopped fucking happening, didn't it? After the pandemic. So who knows?
Maybe we'll be playing like 550 quid for our Switch OLEDs, Matthew, Switch 2 OLEDs, so that could possibly happen. But yeah, the battery is my number one downside. It's not the end of the world because if you're on a train or wherever, they got that little fucking drawing that says, only plug in your laptop or phone.
It's like, fuck off, I'm plugging in my Switch 2, you know what I mean? Like you absolute grifted motherfuckers taking 90 quid off me to be on this train. Guess what?
I'm going to play Mario Kart on it. So it's not like you're ever that far from a plug socket these days, even like the Elizabeth line in London has USB ports and stuff. So you can do that.
You can bring a power brick or whatever. There's always ways to keep it charged. I don't think it's like the end of the world.
It's a bit of a different environment for that sort of thing than it used to be. But just one of those things I noticed, it seems like whatever happens if I'm turning the Switch 2 on, it's at between 46% and 54% every single time I turn it on. And yeah, I just can't work out why that is.
But yes, Matthew, that's enough battery chat. Again, it's not really our area, but there it is nonetheless.
There are a lot of angry YouTube videos about batteries, should you want to see them.
So Matthew has included a section here on Game Chat and Game Share because Matthew's re-branding himself a multiplayer gamer now that the Switch 2 is out. A complete left swerve for him, but keen to hear more about it Matthew. So what's the situation here?
Now that Nintendo have finally made online multiplayer cool and also viable.
Oh my God. No, yes, the game chat is obviously like kind of quite a big feature in terms of how they promoted it, which everyone who already has a PlayStation and Xbox or PC kind of scoffed at, because it's, you know, it is basically forming up a party and then chatting over a headset. I would say that like the Nintendo difference is that they have, I think they've worked quite hard to kind of like uncouple it from like a specific gaming experience rather than this is a tool for you to get together and specifically play say Mario Kart World.
It's more of a, why don't you all hang out as you do your individual thing? And I think there is a distinction there. You know, it's a very, you know, it's two button presses away from just pulling people in to this little chat.
You then have the option of just, you know, speaking to them with your voice. There's a microphone in the Switch 2. There's some quite clever jiggery-pokery going on with a sound chip which eliminates the sound of your game and the mechanical sounds of the Switch itself.
It's pretty clean. Like it's probably not as good as a, you know, a bespoke headset mic, but I've only tested it using the microphone that is in the Switch 2. And, you know, I can talk to it on the other side of the room and Catherine can't hear, Mario Kart on the TV.
So yes, I did make Catherine go upstairs and sit in the bedroom to sort of test game chat. That is part of this experience.
That's marriage.
Yeah, I did a bit of game chat with Catherine and my brother Alex. He's over in Bristol. The other thing you probably know about game chat is that it can pull in a feed of what you're playing and share it with other people at about five frames per second.
So it's like a little kind of flip book of what they're doing. Again, people have been like, her, her, her, look at the low resolution. But as you're playing it, it's not that you don't notice it.
It's more that you're playing your game, but you can kind of class a glance down and be like, oh, Alex is playing as Link in Soul Calibur and Catherine's doing this in Mario Kart World and I'm doing this mini game in Welcome Tour. And you're just kind of like aware of what people are doing. And it is a nice communal experience.
I am quite taken with it. I like the speed at which you go into it and I like the kind of laid back vibe. I like almost that there isn't a purpose to it.
I feel like some of the decisions they've made in specifically Mario Kart World are maybe influenced by that vibe. Like weirdly the open world stuff of Mario Kart World, and we'll get to that when we talk about Mario Kart in a bit. You know, the lack of focus to it or, you know, the quite kind of chilled vibe makes it quite a good companion game to Game Chat.
And I would be interested to know, like, how much of that is deliberate? Is it a happy accident? Or have Nintendo identified a particular tone or level of multiplayer game that suits the kind of Game Chat atmosphere they're trying to conjure, if that makes sense?
Because it definitely works for that game, you know? But you could cynically say, you know, that's just apologizing for them putting this party chat at the heart of the console and a slightly wonky open world mode. But I think there's more to it.
I think it's going to take a few more games to maybe fully understand the potential of it.
Yeah, I mean, I sort of… I can't say this is even remotely on my radar as a feature I'm interested in. I was actually…
I wasn't too surprised when you messaged me saying, Hey, what's your friend code? We should get on game chat. And then I reminded you that the only two games we've ever played in multiplayer together online were Halo Infinite, like five years ago or four years ago, and Redfall a couple of years ago.
That's the only two games we've ever played online. And I've played like, I would say, 250 times more multiplayer than that in that time period, Matthew, with other people. So it is a bit funny, you being like, hey, guess what, I'm the multiplayer guy now.
And in no way do I hold that against you. I just think it's quite sweet.
I don't want to play multiplayer. I just want to have a chat open that we can just chat if we choose to. Otherwise, you can just stay quiet.
That's quite nice, actually. I like that. That's a nice prospect.
And it is, because I was playing I was playing Mario Kart World, Open World, Free Roam. Catherine was free roaming upstairs in the bedroom where I sent her. And we were just, every once in a while she'd be like, oh, I've just done this thing over here.
Or I'd look down and I could see what she'd done. You can, you know, with a couple of button presses, you don't have to have those feeds. You can play it full screen if anyone's worried about that.
I tested out with a camera so that Catherine could see my face getting like live streamed over my gameplay footage. That was all quite easy.
Yeah.
I don't know. I just, I thought it was, it was fun. You know, some people might say, oh, well, you're going to buy an entire online subscription just for that.
And you're like, no, you'll buy an online subscription for all the stuff, you know, which this is also part of. There's a lot of very bad faith reframing of certain things around Switch 2, I found, but whatever. And yeah, and the other thing is GameShare, which is actually quite similar is to SharePlay on the PS5, which I don't know if you've ever tested it.
No, I don't think so. So this is the thing which was kind of pitched. It sounded a bit like the Wi-Fi download play on DS, where, you know, if you've got four people together and one cart, you can send out like a bit of the game to everyone.
It isn't actually working like that. It's a streaming solution to that. So it will really only work in multiplayer or co-op games which are consigned to one screen.
So like Super Mario 3D World, for example, which is what I tested it on. And when you play GameShare in that, which you can play through game chat, in effect, you are streaming the game. I was streaming the game to my brother, Alex, over in Bristol and streaming the game to Catherine upstairs and they were playing their specific characters from that stream.
We were playing co-op multiplayer from my one copy. And like, there's two things to it. The fact that it is going to be limited to like a single screen experience, like it's not like it can send you out like a whole game to go off and you know, you couldn't do Mario open world from one game, for example, like it would have to exist on the same screen.
I do wonder like, will they run out of games which already have that functionality that they can add game share to? Will it inspire them to make more co-op games which could use this technology? That's, you know, that would be a positive.
But you know, it does run the risk of being like neat, but just too limited to the kind of games it works with. But it works.
Yeah, I just can't say I really see it as a valuable... There's not really anything to hang that off of this. So it feels like one of those niche features that just sort of will disappear into the background and no one will really think about it again.
Like, if the mouse controls are a tier above that, and the mouse controls are very, very kind of functional, but I think probably in a few years it's plausible that no first-party Nintendo games actually use it in any meaningful way. I don't know, I just think that this would be a tier below that in terms of potential use cases. Is that to mean…
I mean…
That could be it. That absolutely is how this could play out. I think that they have gone back to all the games that it could work with, and have patched it in.
It does work. I like that I could play some, in effect, online co-op in Super Mario 3D World from one copy of the game where I couldn't before. I think that's pretty good, and they said it wasn't as clean as owning the game themselves, but it was absolutely functional, and they could play it, and they could understand it, and that was all great.
So it does technically work. It just depends on whether they find the right kind of games. At launch there are new games that use it, just not Nintendo games.
So Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S, you can basically game share that, because if you think about that game, it's all contained to one screen, Puyo Puyo on one side, Tetris on the other. So stream that out to someone, absolutely fine. I think the Survival Kids game, which is a bit like a sort of Survival Overcooked, that also works.
So a game like Overcooked, that should do it. In theory, something like Split Fiction could do it.
But it comes with an extra copy of the game anyway, right? Or like a pass for it, so you can download it without owning it? That might be...
Yeah, that's the thing. So you don't necessarily need it. But I do wonder if Nintendo will take a big swing on a multiplayer game that uses it.
Like, will we get a brand new Zelda Four Swords adventure? Will they actually go back to that kind of co-op that they were tinkering with, with the Game Boy Advance link up, but go, well, this is actually inbuilt into the console, so it's actually worth doing now. And you can do it from one copy of the game.
That's quite attractive to me, but it all hinges on them doing it. So let's wait and see.
Yeah, okay. Fair enough. I think it's quite sweet, your overall game chat thing.
What is funny as well is you kind of slid in there that you'd bought the camera for the Switch 2, which hadn't come up previously. But have you loaded up on peripherals, my friend? Have you spent 800 quid on your Switch 2 already?
Oh, I've gone all in on it. I'm just, yeah, I've got that, the Pro Controller. I think that's, I haven't bought like the Wii steering wheel.
Like that's when you're really like all in. I watched a little video of Brie Larson unboxing her Switch 2 and she had like the steering wheel. She had like the charging dock for the Joy-Cons.
Like that's next level. I called it a day, camera and Pro Controller.
Yeah. He's got, he's got Funzo's lower back pain chair. He's got that.
He's got Funzo's European voltage converter and Funzo's dream fortress. He bought all of them Matthew. So congratulations to him.
I mean, where, where you know that I am truly gone is that I have been playing Sonic Time Shadow Generations on Switch 2. I am so all in, courtesy of Sega.
Sega sort us right out of this episode. They gave us each keys for three different games. We'll discuss them all in the next part of the episode.
It's like honeymoon period times like a thousand for me, but I am, I enjoy being excited about new Nintendo hardware.
Yeah, indeed. It's why I'm not giving you too hard a time for it, because I know you're having a good time. So I just wanted to make my Redfall and Halo gag basically, and then my Funzo gags.
One story I have from picking my Switch 2 up, because I went to, when I flew out to SGF, I did think about going, it was on launch day of the Switch 2. My train to Leafbath was at 10.07. The Currys there pre-ordered my Switch 2, opened at 9.
I thought, oh, it's like a 10-minute walk from my house. Could I get there, get back, and basically download the free copy, not free, but the included copy of Mario Kart World, and then get on the train? It's sort of an uncut gem situation.
But I just decided in the end it was too risky. So when I went to pick up my Switch 2 almost a week later, apparently it was the last one pre-order that no one had picked up yet. The guy there, this man just said to me, oh, you're very lucky to get that.
I went, no, I'm not. I paid 400 quid for it five weeks ago. I was not quite in the mood to meet him halfway.
After I said it, I felt really guilty. I was like, fuck, this is just a man in retail who's making polite conversation. I was just a complete dick about it.
I felt so bad about that. I decided to be a lot jollier after that. But yeah, it was apparently the last one.
And they had sold out of every single peripheral, Matthew, every single case, all gone. They said that anything Switch 2 related they had is just completely gone. So what I think that people were like maybe...
I'm sort of like, oh god, it's because of my day job at the moment. I've got my head in analyst chatter all the time. Well, it's very expensive.
So in year one, all the hardcore people will be buying it, but no one will be buying it in year two. And I'm like, no one knows any of this. And I think people are going nuts for this.
I don't think that Nintendo has ever had more cache than this. And do I think they'll get to the point where the new Hyrule Warriors game is 70 quid, and about under half the people who bought the ones on the Switch will buy this one? Absolutely.
I think that will happen with some games because they are so pricey. But I don't know, man. It feels like there is a lot of Switch 2 fever going around.
And so it's just cool. But every single case has been bought. Can you imagine how shit some of those were as well?
I bet some right nav cases got hoovered up.
You've just come out of one of the best eight year runs of a console. So in your head, you probably feel quite safe about the Switch 2. Because you're like, well, you know, those were good years.
If it's as good as that, like, I'd say even if it was half as good as Switch 1, I'd be pretty happy with that as a run. You know, maybe we could come back to that statement in like eight years time. So if that holds up, we'll still be potting in eight years time.
When you're nearly 50 and I'm 45, that sounds great. I mean, in no way is that upsetting.
But our arms are so ripped from the OLED Switch regime.
We both look like Martin Kovar, whatever he's called, from Cobra Kai. That old guy looks like Hey Hatchie in real life. We'll look like that basically.
Is that his name?
That guy does look like he was made in Unreal Engine.
He does. Something about the face that screams.
This is an amazing tech demo that's escaped into this show. Wait, that's an actual human? My God.
I'm pretty sure I saw him in a 7 out of 10 360 third-person shooter about 15 years ago.
I think he was the first guy I punched in Arkham Asylum.
Is it Martin Kovar, something like that? Anyway, let's move on. Yeah.
Okay, so we're going to take a quick break. You're going to hear some Mario Kart music now. I could do it for you if you want.
There will be some actual music that plays here. But I just wanted to boil down what I perceive as the Mario Kart music into a little bit.
Okay, we can get into that.
We can get into that. But that's fine, Matthew. Let's take a quick break and come back with discussion of the Switch 2 games.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, the Nintendo Switch 2 has some computer games as previously established, so we're gonna talk about those in this part of the episode, starting with marquee launch title, Mario Kart World, which is the first new Mario Kart game in 11 years, and introduces an open world. Dude, is that quite right?
It does, it does do that, but it's better to think of it as a reframing of what Mario Kart was using an open world, I think. And one of the interesting tensions I want to unpick, Matthew, is I think that Nintendo mismarketed this game ever so slightly, and this is maybe responsible for some of the, maybe like some of the, not lower review scores, but lower scores than Mario Kart 8 Deluxe got. I think maybe there's a slight mismatch of expectation to what Nintendo was selling.
However, starting with the basics of the game then, so you have your classic sort of like Grand Prix mode, just racing through four different tracks, winning different cups, choosing which character you play as, picking up items, sort of like, you know, power sliding and competing to get to number one. And there's also a knockout mode, which we discussed on the, on the episode we did where Matthew went to play in London, where it's essentially a battle royale of sorts, where only a certain number of players can, at the front of the pack, can get through a gate, and then the rest of the players are shut out, and the number that can get through the gate goes down and down and down, so there's this constant tension of trying to knock each other out. And then there's also a free-roam mode in this wide open world they've built, which basically connects a lot of classic and new Mario Kart tracks together in a contiguous world.
And you can indeed explore that with friends. There's a photo mode. Are there any other modes that are missing there, Matthew, in discussing the game?
Yeah, you can't explore free-roam with friends.
Oh, can't you? Can you not do that? I didn't realize that.
That seems like a bust. Anyway, not really joking. We'll talk about that in more detail.
What's really interesting, though, and I don't think I realized this at all in the pre-release period, and one of the things I like the most about the game, is that it has revised how movement in Mario Kart works quite a lot. It's got the addition of like grind rails. There's some kind of wall thing you can do, Matthew, you're not really sure about that, but there's the addition of when you time a jump perfectly, you get a little boost when you land, and I think all those touches are delightful.
And so, yeah, so you have this like much wider canvas for the tracks, like this immense spectacle, I would say, that comes with some of these tracks as a result of having this open world as a backdrop. It also creates some interesting sort of like quirks in the track design. However, that's me laying enough groundwork, Matthew, because I would love for you to pick up from there and tell me what you think of it after playing it for no doubt hours and hours.
Yeah, yeah, it's been interesting, actually, like sort of, not opinion has changed a bit, but I've kind of, I have played it a lot and I've been trying to play it like naturally, you know, I haven't sat down and gone, I'm just going to play like three straight days of this review. I've been playing it like as and when the mood takes me. And as it turns out, you know, that has been a lot more than it might be for a Mario Kart.
Like I have actually been playing this quite regularly every day and dipping into it here and there. I'll preface it all by saying I think it's quite smart that they haven't just tried to one-up Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which is probably like the ultimate form of that traditional track racing Mario Kart. You could go bigger, you could maybe do like prettier tracks using the new hardware grunts, but I think then you'd probably end up in kind of the same place that Smash Brothers is in, where it's just like more and more and more, but the fundamentals are all there and the people who will like it, you know, they'll always like it, but there is something slightly kind of excellent but plodding about it.
So the desire to kind of mix it up a bit and see what happens if you insert it into the context of a landmass and see what that does for the tracks. I think that's like a worthy experiment. You know, if years from now people are weighing up Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart World, I would argue that they are such different games trying to do different things that maybe that's not a very useful exercise.
I think crucially what it is I really enjoy. I think the way it stitches together longer tracks with conjoining roads or landscape is really, really well done. I think it creates this sense of like less racing, more like closer to like wacky races or something.
It's this like din of chaos and almost like the kind of cartoon cloud with like all limbs coming out of it from different angles. Like these races can be like pretty intense places to be when you know certain bits of the track, but you know, fundamentally like understanding the fundamentals of Mario Kart. You know, how to use the different weapons, how to deploy them at the right time, how to make the most of little speed boosts here and there.
You know, that stuff can kind of like pull you ahead and get you out. I think once you're out of the kind of chaos zone, which exists in a lot of these races, you know, it is still down to like, you know, your skill as a Mario Kart player isn't a total crap shoot, which it might seem to begin with. We are just like, what the fuck is going on?
This 24 players, this is manic. I really, really like the scale of the world. I really like that, you know, you have things which are like clearly defined tracks bleeding into things which aren't, which are the kind of stitching material.
I think the thing that surprised me the most about it actually was that, that conjoining material is like so well thought out in places that I didn't always realise what was formal track and what wasn't. And that was really my big concern, would that you be on a very like tightly authored track and then all of a sudden going in like a straight line for a minute and it would feel like a bit of a dud. And there are stretches of this world which do that, you know, there are certain like motorways which aren't maybe as electric as others.
But generally I think they thought about, you know, all the sort of like arteries of this world have the feel of a race track with like big curves to them, regular weapon placement. I think there's a lot of character that separates different landscapes, like the way they add obstacles. I think a stretch of road which isn't technically a track can have the character of a track when done well.
And that's the thing I wasn't expecting to see in the game. I think that's the thing which has like impressed me the most, or maybe not impressed me, like relieved me the most, that I think it does work. It doesn't feel like I'm in a B-tier bit of this game at the moment.
Like it all feels pretty A-tier to me.
I mostly agree. I do think that you notice more than in other Mario Kart games that there are like stretches of straight road you're going down. I would say that there's just like a few tracks where there's a very, I'm like, I've been going in a straight line for a long time here, where I've wondered, is this because it's meant they've thought, they've had to think about the geography of getting from one place to another, or is it because they do want to stretch where it's just, you all get items and fuck each other up, 24 different players, which is also possible.
But I think there's just every now and then I'll hit a point where I'm like, well, this is slightly inert and not much is happening, relative to some of the rest of it. However, I would say I probably only noticed that about, I've not played every track yet in Grand Prix. I've played all but the last cup I've done.
What I will say is that even though I do think that, I believe that it's true that there are like some, some like straights that just aren't that interesting.
I agree with that too.
I think that the design of the world more generally is fantastic. And you really see it in Knockout Mode in particular, when you're going between these different areas. There's a slightly kind of trippy dreamy quality to just sort of like going out of the countryside and into suddenly a fucking booze manor and then suddenly into a volcano and stuff.
Like the idea of having to logically stitch these things together. The truth is there is no logic. What it reminds me of is in Jonathan Hickman's Secret Wars comic, when loads of different patches of Marvel Universe are stuck together.
And so you have like a far future dystopia old man Logan universe next to a fucking modern day Manhattan universe or something. Just things that don't really make sense as a kind of, as a sort of like landmass where people might live and sort of operate their lives. But I think it's just a really fun space.
I think that if you then, and I'm getting ahead of ourselves a little bit here, if you then switch into free roam mode, I think you just interrogate the seams of it too much. But I don't think you think about it at all when you're racing. And I think it makes for some really thrilling transition moments of, wow, I can't believe I'm here now when I was there like a minute ago.
And I love that about this game, you know?
Yeah, I think some of the natural landscape as well is put to such good use in knockout mode. I think you are right, the kind of conjoining bits and the thought that's gone into the knockout races, which are like, you know, one straight, almost 10 minute long race, I guess, are maybe slightly more interesting than some of the ones in the Grand Prix. There's an absolutely brilliant knockout track where you end up going from the, I think it's called Starview Peak or Starview Tower, the kind of the level which is sort of like Rosalina's Castle, Bitmaria Galaxy-esque, and you come out of that and then you're suddenly driving along this icy precipice, which is basically the peaks of all the mountains that her castle is atop.
And like, that is a piece of the landscape. That isn't part of her track, but it is as good as anything in that game. And you're up so high and you can see everything down below.
And I think it's there that it really pays off. And I think there are enough moments of magic like that where you think, oh, I'm really glad that they actually did this, that they stitch it together this way. And I like that everything is in context and it doesn't feel, to me anyway, like it's just filled out with like empty fields.
I feel like there is a real kind of like eye for the landscape and real purpose. And this is a company that has only made a couple of proper open world games. So it's quite impressive for them to get that stuff right.
Speaking of straights, which have a bit of character, I do really like the bridge approach to the city, which even though a straight line, there's always vehicles with different obstacles coming out of them. They've got different characteristics. There are like, some vehicles are like brilliant to be stuck behind because the driver's like chucking out speed mushrooms.
And you're like, this is great. We're just boosting our way. And there are like ramps off the back of certain cars so you can boost off them.
But then every once in a while, there'll be like a shit head who's got like a giant cannon that's firing out like bullet bills or whatever. Real mixed vehicle selection from the residents of this city. Complete disregard for who's behind them.
And I think there's like enough of that kind of stuff going on to give even a very long straight road, which the bridge is, like a real sense of character. Like when I hit the bridge in a Grand Prix race or a knockout race, I'm like, I kind of have ideas of how I'm going to tackle this. And I think really that's what, you know, when I say I was surprised by some of the connecting tissue, like that's, you know, when it peaks like that.
But you are right, there's bits where I'm like, this isn't as, you know, this isn't as thrilling as it could be.
Yeah.
But I was worried that that might be the case for like all non-track roads. And I don't think that is true.
No. And I think it's worth the trade off of having a few spaces like that.
Yeah.
To have a game like this versus another game like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Because it's ambitious in this very specific way. It's like, it's like I can sort of, it's like they've compromised on the, they could have made the Free Roam part of the whole game.
And we will talk, we will come to Free Roam in more detail, I imagine, because I imagine you've played more of it than me. But like, by using the potential of an open, by using the sort of like the spectacle that an open world gives you, and sort of like using that to basically juice up the Mario Kart formula with all these new movement options, I think it's like, I don't think you can ask for much more from a new entry in this series. Like it's a really hard series to reinvent anyway.
And this is like, I would say like a soft reinvention, but like, I think it is constantly delighting you in terms of the visuals of the game. It's a beautiful looking game. But it's also, like you say, the city approach.
I mean, there is like a weather system in this game. When I first played that track, Crown City in Grand Prix, it was the sun was setting when I got to the skyline. And I was like, that's like a fucking GTA open world, like feeling I'm getting from this game.
Like just to sort of like, even though there's lots of preposterous drivers on the road chucking shit around and like ridiculous items and stuff. There's just that like little hum you get inside of being in an open world and it feeling very authentic. And there's nothing in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is anything like that.
Some beautiful tracks for sure, like amazing sort of like up close, beautiful looking things. But it's just the horizon line of this game is often incredible. And I don't know, I just think that it just looks spinning around with a stick and seeing what's around you.
There's a real sense that they've built what is not just in front of you, but is also kind of like left and right. And like when you look over there, you probably see something. And I just, yeah, I really like that about it.
I think it's like an amazing game from what I've played so far, you know?
Oh, good. Well, I'm glad because, you know, I definitely feel that way, too. I was going to say another way that it's very different from GTA is that the soundtrack of Mario Kart World is way better than anything else they've ever done.
More than one drum in these tracks, for sure.
Oh, wait, actually, it wasn't Health that did the fucking, they did Max Payne 3, shit.
No, Health are in GTA V as well.
Tangerine Dream.
Oh, now you can fuck off, Tangerine Dream. You have to, hands off them.
No, Mario Kart World is better. I'd rather listen to like a big band version of like Mario Paint.
I would rather listen to the soundtrack from Risky Business than the soundtrack to Mario Kart World. It's my take, Matthew. But nonetheless, anyway.
Yeah, so I did want to talk about Knockout Mode here, because here's the other thing, right? Yes. This mode is like having a Tetris 99 or F-Zero 99 style, frenzied, luck-based to a large extent, but with some skill, absolutely addictive, wonderful multiplayer game that shows you in itself why the kind of like open world thing makes sense, open world template makes sense for Mario Kart.
It's the best sort of like case study of why they did it, because like I say, it's the driving from one side of the map to the other as part of it. But it's so exciting because you have 24 human players competing, and so all of like similar skill, plus all of the bullshit Mario Kart rubber banding going on, and ridiculous items, and like some people getting lucky with items, some people not. It's like that's the proper sort of like wacky racer's complete carnage.
It's boiled down into these like just minutes long games that feel absolutely phenomenal, and not like something you've played before, and for me represent the real like highlight of this game. I imagine to a lot of people it will too. I think this is what gives it a massive amount of potential longevity, beyond the usual, it's Christmas, let's get Mario Kart out and play Splitscreen.
This fucking rules Matthew, so what do you think of it?
Yeah, no, I'm in complete agreement. I think the problem I have with like a lot of Battle Royale style games is that very few of them can sustain themselves for the length of their respective rounds. Like they're either, you know, very exciting at the start when loads of stuff's going on, they're very exciting at the end when it's super tense and you might win, but there are lots of patches of like, fuck all going on and you can spend half an hour playing a game that doesn't go anywhere and fundamentally ends in nothing.
And I think the length of the knockout races is very well judged and they're kind of exciting from the off. You know, whenever you press like play online knockout mode, you know, you're going to have that proper knockout experience every single time, like it can guarantee it on tap. Maybe that's because it's not as complicated a strategic experience as like Battlegrounds or fucking Apex Legends or whatever.
That's probably true, probably true.
But you know, it doesn't have like, oh wait, you can't like maybe express yourself as much but it knows what's fun about that mode and it gets you into it like instantly. And I do think the more of it you play, you do realise that there are subtleties about it. If you're in one of those races and you're not winning from the start, you may think, well, this is going to be a huge bust.
But actually the constant kind of like elastic to and fro, you know, the way that one weapon can suddenly send you to the back of the pack from first position, you know, as quickly as the correct item can take you from the back of the pack to first position. You almost have to kind of like survive the first half of the race when there are 24 races. And then as the pack thins out, I think the people left are like the more serious contenders.
And then it slowly mutates into a more traditional skill based Mario Kart race. So it ends on quite a skillful, satisfying, not, you know, you know, I am very far from a get good style kind of gatekeeper, but I like the fact that it does end on, you know, more of a pure test of like, do you understand the courses? You know, do you, you know, can you drift around these corners or whatever?
Where I think to begin with, you know, you can be just scraping through and still go on to win. And that particular dynamic and the way they've judged that, I think is what makes it really work for me. Like it just has a, there is like a narrative to the race and you're kind of pulled into it regardless.
It's kind of brilliantly done. I just wonder if they've been using all these 99 games to just get a sense of how things work. Like the psychology or the mentality around these modes.
Like what people like, what is an optimal length, what's satisfying, what isn't, what's unfair, you know. And, you know, however they've done it though, I think they have landed on something special. I think it is the best bit of this.
You know, and they've had to build this huge landmass to make this work. You know, it's not, oh, that's a bonus to this mode, but this is the game, you know?
Yeah, I agree. It is the game. You know, I said the classic Grand Prix experience is still incredibly good in this, for sure.
Some of the tracks are absolutely brilliant. You know, most of the tracks are absolutely brilliant. I've had a really good time with it, but yeah, it's like, that's why I almost think that the way they presented it in that Switch 2 reveal was slightly wrong.
They put too much focus on FreeRome, and that's not even close to what the game is. But you play knockout mode and you're like, this is exactly what you wanted to make from the start, isn't it? This is it.
I'm playing it right now. And the open world is built to support that. And yeah, it's great.
I mean, I can't remember the last time I played a multiplayer game that's got where the switch between it's so over and we're so back is so instantaneous. You know what I mean? It's a proper like go from 12th to 2nd and go from 2nd to 12th kind of in a moment kind of experience.
And there's nothing like when you are like the 8th person to squeeze through that 8 person sort of gate, knowing that you've just like red shelled the person behind you and left them spinning out and knowing that their game is over. There's like such a like wonderful feeling of I just know how angry you are right now. And like I know what I've taken from you.
And it's so good. It's so good in a way that I don't think I've experienced that exact thing in Mario Kart before. I've seen like the slow agony of people losing a race to me.
I've seen like that happened to family members, to romantic partners. I've seen that how many times. But there's just something about the it's like having a instead of having a pint, it's like having a shot.
You know what I mean? That's what playing this mode is like. It's really good.
Well done. Well done, Nintendo. It was well worth making Mario Kart World for this mode.
Very impressive, Matthew. Anything else you want to add on Mario Kart World before we move on?
I will just say on the open world, because I have played more of it, that I do like it. I absolutely get the criticisms. I think some people came into this expecting a sort of Forza Horizon single-player first structure, and I do understand that maybe from some of the promotion, the fact that they showed the free-roam mode in the way that they did, I can understand why you might think that.
But I'm not saying anything outside the knockout mode is just a sweet bonus. It is an expensive game and you want every bit of it to absolutely sing. That said, I have really grown to enjoy the open world.
I think it is quite a vibes-based thing. If you like driving around and listen to a soundtrack. I think where we may be different on this, I think this is an all-timer Nintendo soundtrack.
I think this is incredible. It's some of my favourite game music of all time, given these orchestrations in a style that I really like. When I hear a slow jazz rendition of Luigi's Mansion theme, or a new version of Gusty Garden Galaxy, hearing that music is a 10 out of 10 experience for me.
It won't be for everyone, it is for me. So driving around listening to that stuff, I am in a special kind of heaven. In GTA V, I love driving around listening to songs that I like.
That is something I enjoy in open world games. So that is a tick. I really like seeing the tracks out of context.
When you are on a track, you don't really think of it as a physical space, but being able to drive up and see Mario Circuit or Peach's Castle and it is like this impossible loop in the sky and you are like, God, it looks massive from where I am down here. That is kind of fun. The almost out of hours nature of seeing a game space from a different angle, that has tickled me a lot.
I do like the challenges.
They are not low lift, loads of them have got quite bespoke elements and mechanics to them, and there is loads of them. I don't know if you have looked into this, like the little Pee Switch challenges that pop up, but there are hundreds of these things. I've seen some people voice the opinion, I've done five of those and I didn't really like them, and you're like, well, that's not even 0.01% of what they are.
That seems mad to me. And I think if you can get into the groove of just going around the map, trying to find the Pee Switches is part of the exploration experience in itself. I don't actually buy the criticism that the map should be covered in icons.
There isn't a map. Maybe it could do with a map full stop. That I will agree with.
But the idea that I just want to tick a lot of stuff off a map, like that is not how, you know, open world's worked in Breath of the World and Tears of the Kingdom. I just don't think like Nintendo want to give you that kind of simple completionist experience. You know, I think it is slightly vibey, like I say.
It made most sense for me playing it with that game chat. Me and Catherine both playing single player mode by ourselves, but kind of just chatting and hanging out and listening to the music. I've had a good time with it.
So it kind of doesn't make me sad to see people not gelling with it. But I've seen some people just go, oh, it's a load of shit. And you're like, it just isn't, you know, that's just wrong.
You know, it's not a traditional racing game. But what did you expect? It's Mario Kart, you know, it's kind of crazy that they've done any of this.
So I think it does require sounding more defensive than I wanted to. It's good. I wanted to celebrate.
Well, I think this is Nintendo's fault. I think they did this to themselves. Like that, I watched back that Switch 2 reveal and they were like in a vast world and then they talked up Free Roam and they were clearly leaning into open world and it's just like, it's unmistakable.
It's part of how they pitched it. And so I think that the disappointment is amplified by that. I think that, yeah, I don't know, if they'd have been like Grand Prix knockout against the backdrop of this amazing world and then like never, not mentioned Free Roam to like one week before the game came out.
Right. But I think that might have been the play, just to set expectations correctly. But like I don't have a problem with it.
I think the P-Switch thing is maybe a bit more of an acquired taste to something you do over and over again. And compared to like, I think maybe you just need to go in with the expectation it's not for the horizon, because it's not. And if you keep that in mind, maybe you won't be disappointed.
But nor do I think it will blow you away, like knockout mode and the Grand Prix are capable of doing, you know.
It's a very different flavor to that, absolutely. But I think it is like, valid what they've done. I think there are things they can do to make it better.
Like, there is a bit of map work they can do. I don't want to see all the P switches on a map. I don't think that would be good.
But like, having a map that I can quickly fast travel about without having to like, leave FreeRoam and select the map option. Little things like that I would be into. I'd be really interested to see if they have like, grand future plans for this.
Because obviously Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ended up being, you know, having this second life with this huge expansion pass of DLC courses. And here it's kind of harder to see like, you know, could that field become a course? Could this stretch of coastline become another course?
You know, there might be a bit of that going on. But like, so much of the road, there's so much, like, potential track that isn't used in knockout mode or the Grand Prix that I can't help but think, like, surely they've got to be weighing up, like, custom courses. Like, let's just lay down some checkpoints and make some user-made courses here.
Because there's so much real estate that isn't used in that way. You know, I can just see huge potential in it, but it's whether they're like, this is done, you know, that's what we're making, Mario Kart World, enjoy it. It's very hard to tell with Nintendo.
They can kind of go either way, you know? Yeah. It could be a Splatoon style, constantly adding to it, or it could be, you know, pay you 80 pounds, this is what you get for life.
You know, ask me again in eight years when this has or hasn't sold 70 million copies, it's like Mario Kart 8, you know?
Yeah. Ask 48-year-old Matthew Castle, who's no doubt got a bad back.
Stop bringing up how old I'll be for the next Nintendo console.
I'll be old too. I'll be old too. Anyway, yeah, so I'm curious about that as well, because I think that what the DLC came along so late for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that it almost represented that sort of maybe, I feel like Splatoon did this to Nintendo, kind of like wired them to think a bit differently about games in their own sort of live service way.
And so I think that's why, I think Splatoon is probably why we ended up getting those Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tracks because they just saw how much potential there was to build on the base game of what you've put out there. So I'm almost certain they'll do something else with it, Matthew. Even if not, if just putting in some new knockout mode tracks would be really, really good.
Another 200 P-Switches, do it!
Also I will say this, to people who are wondering does this have value as a single player experience, I would say if you are vehemently against multiplayer, perhaps not, but if you can...
Oh yeah, you've got to want the whole thing, I think. I wouldn't tell anyone they buy it for free roam alone. All I'm saying is that I have had a pretty good time with free roam.
It's not like a Zelda level experience for me, don't get me wrong, but it's pretty chill. Like I play like an hour of it every day, I have done since it came out, and it's good. I'll tell you what it's really good for, after knockout when you are incredibly stressed, probably like your heart rate is probably unbelievable.
Just pootling around a course, doing a little challenge, there's a lot of challenges, they almost feel like pilot wings, it's very like chill. It's like glide through these hoops. I'm like, yeah, absolutely, I'll do that after knockout, which makes me want to put my foot through the TV.
So I think they have to have free roam in there, just to stop people from hurting themselves.
I was going to say that I do not advise letting small children play knockout mode. It's like, I think that children can play Mario Kart like Grand Prix, and the frustration and highs and lows of that are much more tempered. But there's just something about how fucking emotional and fast everything moves in knockout mode that just, I don't know, I think there should be an 18 plus on the box for this game.
Just because of this mode, I really do, honestly. There's like, there was like a lunchtime, it was just like a proper sequence of being kicked in the balls from being first to like 24th, and then being like, and then just me just saying to my Switch 2, well, you just ruined my life, haven't you? That's what I just said to my Switch 2, and I was like, if I'm not emotionally capable of handling this, a 10 year old definitely isn't going to be.
So I will caution that, because I know we have a lot of parents who are obviously listening to the podcast, so I don't know about letting small children play knockout mode, but the point I was going to make was, if you only like single player experiences, I will say challenge yourself to play knockout mode anyway, because you are going to be exposed to one of the most exciting things Nintendo has made in recent years, and I think that it's such a different multiplayer experience to, if you have always been put off multiplayer because you think someone in Call of Duty is going to go, you're fucking twat shooting the head or whatever. It's so not that. It's not like you've got voice chat or anything like that.
You basically just have players with a nearly identical skill level to you, just like doing wacky races like Matthew says. And I think that you can enjoy that with a bit of a single player mentality. I know it sounds ridiculous, but you kind of can.
It's like it's so isolated from the experience of like dealing with people that I think that it's got crossover potential for people who don't think they like multiplayer. Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, it's like playing against a load of AI, except occasionally the AI is one of your, like has the names of one of your mates. And you get really frustrated and you say terrible things and then you're glad that the Switch 2 game chat isn't just like universally on all the time for everyone.
That would be so bad.
The Welcome Tour doesn't mention that the Switch 2 sound chip edits out like more extreme swearing or anything, but that could be a thing they could look into.
That must have been a fun job for someone, deciding what those words would be and then programming that. Okay, Matthew.
It does it. The game chat has a mode where it can auto transcribe what you're saying and put subtitles up on the screen for everyone. And it doesn't bleep out swearing.
Like if you swear in a way, it says it all there. It's quite funny seeing like the Nintendo interface just putting up all this bile.
Yeah. Okay. Well, on that note, Matthew, more great factoids from you there, all gleaned from a Nintendo Switch 2 welcome tour.
An eight pounds, sorry, seven, between seven and eight pounds purchase. That, you know, some have argued should come with the system. Has got like a lukewarm response from some people.
Is sort of somewhere between a game and a-
Some babies.
The Nintendo Apologist Tour has begun. 2025. Is somewhere-
Is somewhere between like a leaflet and a game, I would say, or like a mini-game compilation. But why don't you talk about it? Cause I feel like this is something you really like.
And I've not played loads of it, so I don't have loads of authoritative takes on it. So why don't you go for it?
Here's the thing, I do really like this. I think it is aimed at an incredibly specific kind of Nintendo fan, it isn't aimed at all Nintendo fans. This is not for your average, I have a room filled with merch, I've been to the theme parks, I've been to the museum.
Like, that's not what this is about. This is for the freaks like me who want to know what makes Nintendo tick. If you've read every single Awata Ask, this is a game for people who think like that.
It's very much for people who are, you know, obsessed with what goes on behind those closed doors, you know. It's that kind of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, you know, if you are Charlie Bucket with your head pressed up to the gates wondering what goes on in that big gray cube in Kyoto. I think, you know, this opens at the tiniest of cracks, but it's enough for me.
There's like three parts to this. There's like tech demos which show off, you know, what HD Rumble does, what some of the HD screen stuff does, you know, that stuff's absolutely fine. It's quite, you know, some of it has an initial wow factor to it.
There are lots of demos largely based around the mouse. I think like a secret undercurrent of Welcome Tour is that the mouse is a reasonably big deal to them and they've thought quite a lot about the mouse, which isn't necessarily what you'd get from the marketing on Switch 2. But it is definitely a big through line.
I'd say like 80% of the games feel like they're mouse games, which you know, of varying levels of success. Then there's this quiz component. The actual quiz is very rudimentary, not particularly exciting to do.
But what I do like is all the information attached to the quizzes where you basically go through and it explains to you how all the different bits of the Switch 2 works. This virtual museum is based on a giant Switch 2, so you're walking around a Joy-Con, you're walking around the screen, you go inside the base at one point, all this kind of stuff. It basically tells you some of the thinking behind the machine.
None of it gets too heavy, none of it's too complicated. Fundamentally, it still wants to be family-friendly. But I am interested in what makes Nintendo tick.
I'm interested in their decisions behind things. There's some incredibly nerdy industrial design stuff in this about how they build the Joy-Con grip to make sense, how the magnets work on the Joy-Con. And that stuff, I am interested in it.
If you're not, don't buy this game. It doesn't have anything for you in there, and that's absolutely fine. But it has sort of saddened me just to see people go, oh, it's a load of old shit, and then that's it.
And you're like, well, okay, you know, fair enough. But it just isn't for you. It's quite a substantial thing.
I've probably played it for about six hours, done a lot of the demos. There's lots of medals you can win doing the minigames. Quite like, moorish.
I've said this before, I think, on the podcast. It reminded me of the kind of stupid little challenges we would have made great hay with them in NGamer by asking people to send in their best times and best scores. There's quite a lot of little fun, like one more go mouse challenges, or as the sneering online masses call them, lazy flash games.
You know, they aren't the most cutting edge of things. But they explain interesting potential of the technology. They explore some interesting ideas.
I think it's quite interesting that you've got a piece of software that tries to explain some of these baffling bits of terminology that we see in Digital Foundry that tries to explain how variable frameworks work and how an HDTV works, and why this interaction might feel good and that interaction would feel bad. I don't want to sound too preachy or worthy and say this is providing an invaluable service. It's obviously, like I say, not for everyone.
But I think there is some value in trying to explain that very boring, alienating stuff in a more accessible way. I think it shows a curiosity which I respond to. So I'm not going to apologize for liking it.
And I think it was worth £8. That it wasn't a pack-in, I actually think makes sense. I would have loved to have been a pack-in because I like it.
But that it isn't, I think, is a sort of tacit understanding of Nintendo that this isn't going to be for everyone. I don't think it actually has a huge amount of value as a pack-in for everyone, because it isn't a universally fun experience. Now, that is a crazy bit of defense work from the Nintendo apologist.
Well…
That this is too niche to give to people for free, and so you must pay money for it. But that's the line I'm going for. In my head, it makes sense.
I don't understand the review, so I think it's shit and it should have been a pack-in. And you're like, why do you want it to be a pack-in if you think it's so shit? What value does that have?
That makes no sense to me. That is a baffling observation to make. Some of the worst game reviews I've ever read have been for this game.
Instantly.
Well, you know what they're saying.
You can not like it, but there is some terrible writing out there about this. People are just like, YouTube comment quality criticism.
But you know what they're saying.
It shouldn't be doing it. Step away from it.
But you know what they're saying. What they're saying is, if the company who packaged in Wii Sports, with the value that had as a freebie, why with this, which is, I would say a lot less valuable, a piece of software than Wii Sports, why as a matter of course, would you not just include it? I think that's what people are saying.
I don't think that's a bad faith argument. I mean, I see what you're saying. If they don't think it's good, then why you desperate for it to be packed in?
I get why you're saying that, but surely you understand that what they're saying is that by itself, it doesn't have enough value and therefore, why not just include it, especially if what it's doing is educating you on the thing that you've bought and also a key function of the thing you've bought, the mouse control. That's why people are saying that in those reviews, to play devil's advocate, Matthew.
No, you're not playing devil's advocate. You're playing, that is the rational response. I am incredibly irrational on the subject of welcome tour.
I get it. I have a role to play in this podcast and that's it. But I have just, I don't know.
I just, it's that, when you've had fun with something and you have got your money's worth, it's just frustrating to see people feeding a quite lazy narrative that like, there's nothing to it, you know, or it's a complete waste of time or it's worthless or that it's instantly worthless because it wasn't packed in. Like, this thing costs less than my fucking lunch. You know, like, I can get a Gyoza and a Diet Coke from Ittsu, or I can get the Welcome Tour.
Or a Banh Mi from Noya's Kitchen.
Welcome Tour lasted much longer than my lunch.
Yeah, Banh Mi from Noya's Kitchen, Matthew.
Yeah, well, that's it, like, in Welcome Tour, I don't have to sit in a weird room with a load of strange men who I think might kill me before I get my sandwich, you know? It's, there are so many plus points in Welcome Tour's paper compared to Banh Mi's sandwiches, and really I think that's how we have to think about Welcome Tour.
I think you have hit on something that is worth defending this game with. Out of all of that, the thing that I really agree with you on, and it's only one thing, is that this isn't a quiet taste by design. It's not for everyone, it's not thrilling, a lot of it does depend on you having an interest in industrial design and the way Nintendo thinks about things.
And like you say, being the kind of person who will read every single a-watter-ass and the more recent Nintendo Q&A stuff they've been doing, that I think is totally fair as a defence of this. What I will say is, I think it could just look nicer. Like, I don't have a problem with the content as such, but like why couldn't this be a WarioWare game?
I think how much nicer it would look and sound if it was a WarioWare game. Instead, it's got what I would describe as like a British Airways kind of like leaflet aesthetic.
Oh, that's brutal, but that is right.
There's just something about it that has that kind of like, and remember, stay in the crash position when the plane goes down, sort of like something about it.
It is quite hard to see them setting a Smash Bros. stage in Welcome Tour. I will say that.
Yeah, I mean, even compared to something like Wii Fit, Wii Fit's got such a defined aesthetic. Do you know what I mean? It's sort of like, it's not the most interesting, visually stimulating thing Nintendo's ever made, but there is something about this.
It reminded me of like how that Dragon Drive game where I was a bit like, why doesn't this look better? That's how I felt playing this. I was like, you're on fucking Nintendo.
You're amazing at art. Like, why does this look so flat? And the minigames in particular, I'm just like, oh man.
I mean, just imagine if you did give it the WarioWare coat of paint, how distinctive those could look. And you think about things like, yeah, think about something like Face Raiders or something. Like, is that the right game to pick up it?
Like the three, the weird little 3DS games.
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
It just doesn't quite have that character, you know?
But then I don't think you can, like, marry Wario to this. Because I don't think you can have, like, an agent of chaos. Because that puts you in the head, you know, in the mind space of like, oh, we're going to be up for some mischief, I'm going to see something really crazy.
And then Wario starts, you know, explaining, like, magnet polarity in HD Rumble. I think it would feel like Wario had gone straight in a way that no one would enjoy.
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I think it's more just I wish it had a bit more of a theme to it. But I don't really have I don't have a problem with it.
I will say that. Like, I think I'm kind of lukewarm on it. But it's not like the end of the world.
It's eight quid. Like you say, it's not not much of the grand scheme of things. Much funnier to hear you taking shots at writers.
That's way better. It was worth talking about it just for that.
I won't say who. I just I read one thing. It was just so lousy.
Like, it was just full of, like, outrage from the off about, like, the packing thing. And it's like, it's like, fair enough. But I can, I can see that everywhere for free.
You know, like, I can see that from people who haven't been paid to have an interesting opinion.
Yeah.
But that just is, that just isn't an interesting thing to contribute to this conversation.
Yeah.
For me.
No, I get you. Because what that, that's an example of something that becomes like, it's like a, it ingrained, it's like a take that people have, like, inherited basically. And they're not, they're not really breaking through it to, to kind of like, they don't really have any kind of, I mean, on this podcast, we try and have a bit of a, I think we go into things optimistically.
We don't go into things giving things a kicking. We go into things saying, well, what is this? And even if it ends up being like a six out of ten shooter or something, we're quite honest about our journey to get there.
And we don't, we try not to recycle takes from the internet. I think you're probably right. I think there is, there's maybe a little bit of like, people, you know, sort of like takes creeping in from, from the internet that people just can't quite get out of their heads when they're talking about these things.
And they end up becoming the defining narrative and you can't really, and you don't say anything different about it. I understand why you feel that way. And while also thinking the packing thing is not necessarily an unfair criticism.
So it's not, it's not my main point of view on it. My main point of view is I wish it just looked nicer. And, you know, I've just, I've spent a lot of time on British Airways planes lately.
You know, some of that designs, you know, pretty good in itself, Matthew. So I'm just trolling now.
The problem is, the problem with this whole interaction, Samuel, is that while you were away at Summer Games Fest, I was left by myself in the Discord and I gave someone both barrels for basically voicing that very opinion.
Like me, like me with blueprints. That was like your blueprints, basically. That was, it was that situation.
Yeah, I just think, just, we have to go loopy occasionally.
Yeah, I think so.
You know, and it's important that if you're going to sacrifice all your dignity, you do it for something important like the Nintendo Switch 2 welcome tour.
Well, to the Discord point, like it's, that's our back garden. Don't shit in our back garden. If you're going to shit in our back garden, we're going to say something about it.
That's just, that's just how the Discord works. So you're well within your rights there. However, that is extremely amusing.
And so on that note, Matthew, let's move, let's move on to some of the other games you've been playing on Switch. We got, that was, I really enjoyed discussing those. This makes me think that maybe the Switch 2 is going to be quite a fun thing to discuss on a recurring basis on this podcast, because you are so into it.
And you're into a lot of things we discussed on this podcast, but you're into it in a way where I'm like, oh, is he definitely okay? There's a little bit of that to it.
It feels like, I don't know, it feels like it's like, it's like reawakened, like my Nintendo magazine juice. You know, yeah, this is, this is the kind of sort of demented character I had to be on NGamer. And I'm like, oh yeah, I still am that deep down.
Fuck, it's the, it's like unforgiven when he comes back at the end. And it's like he sort of resurrected his old dark self. That's you going into the bar and fuck it, fucking those guys up, fucking up Gene Hackman.
Okay, Matthew, good stuff. Honestly, I got such a buzz out of hearing you talk about these games. Great stuff.
I was locked in. I was having a great time. Okay, so Matthew, you shook down a bunch of PRs for some keys of ports.
Sega really paid out, as previously established. Very kind of them to send us keys for these games. You also been playing Cyberpunk 2077.
So I was curious why you wanted to play this again. Personally, I feel like this is such a next gen experience that it's worth playing on at least a PS5 just to see it at its best. But I know that this has been an impressive port job.
That's what people have been saying. So how have you been finding it on the Switch 2?
This was the thing I was curious about. Because it was the one game when I played it at the Switch 2 preview event, I thought it was a bit of a mess and was like, oh boy. And CD Projekt Red seemed to be talking quite a good game about it.
They were really putting in all these interesting mouse controls and motion controls. Like, you know, as far as third parties were going, they seemed to be making like the most, quote unquote, effort. And so I was just interested to see, you know, where they landed on it.
And, you know, it obviously isn't the same visual standard as the PS5 version or playing on a lovely PC. But I was really impressed by what they've done with this and how they've tied it up. And the level they've got it to, if you play it docked, it's like locked to 30 frames.
But the actual visual quality of it is pretty good. Like, it looks pretty sharp to me. However, they're doing it, like quite nice HDR stuff.
Like, I've played Cyberpunk on PS5 and PC. I know what it's meant to look like. And I was like, oh, wow, they've actually really done a number on this since I played it last.
So that has a positive effect. On handheld, I think it feels like a little miracle having it on something that small. I think the performance mode in handheld is more like 40 frames.
And it does make a difference because it has that, again, that VRR stuff going on on the LCD screen. Like, it just feels a little smoother, a little nicer. When it's crushed down like that, the visual density of it is as good as it needs to be.
And it just took me back to covering third-party games. You know, it really reminded me of the Wii U launch, where there were, like, some things that were made in, like, good faith but were just so misjudged. Like, a version of Mass Effect 3 with Wii U bells and whistles, when on a console where most hot...
You know, if you'd only ever had Nintendo platforms, you'd never have played Mass Effect 1 or 2. So Mass Effect 3, I just don't think has any, like, value. Here, I think the gap between when it came out and now, you know, doesn't feel like, you know, doesn't feel like an old, tired game, for one.
The fact that it's all the DLC, the expansion pack, everything, the fact that it is this full experience, that feels very complete, feels quite premium and nice as a package. And also, if you only have lived in the Nintendo ecosystem, it is, it is a taste of a kind of, you know, technical showpiece that you just will never have had. And I think all those things combine into, like, this is a worthwhile port, you know, they've done a good job on this, you know, if you, you know, it's easy to go, oh yeah, I could just play it on my PC.
And you're like, well, yeah, if you don't have that, if you only have a Switch, and then you only have an out, have a Switch 2, like, this is a, this is a fine way to play this game. And that, that really surprised me. And yeah, I've played like a couple of hours of this, thought it was decent.
You know, I was, yeah, pleasantly surprised. I was like, oh man, I would love to have covered this in a magazine. Like, you could actually crowed about some of this stuff.
You know, I've covered bad third party games. So yeah, you know, thumbs up.
It's interesting that Nintendo, we're in this era now where games are just much stickier, where, you know, arguably to the detriment of the industry, games just kind of kick around in, like, the people's headspace and in the conversation much more. You're right that the downside, like you say, with Mass Effect 3 was that Wii U port didn't have the first two games. That sucked.
But even something like Batman, for some reason, maybe it's just because, you know, the generations are moving on so quickly. The Batman Arkham City being on Wii U felt like such a non-event to me. But there is something different about having Cyberpunk on Switch.
And like, when like Yakuza 0 comes to Switch, if you've never played those games before and you encounter them now, it's not like those games have really gone away. I'm not there really thinking, well, that's a fucking old game. I mean, Yakuza is 0.
It's like an eight-year-old game. It might even be older than that, like its original Japanese release. I think it is.
But like, we're in a different era now where people are just playing these things forever, partly because of digital storefronts, I think. And they just kick around in the memory more. I don't think people have stopped talking about Cyberpunk at all since it came out like almost five years ago.
And so, yeah, now, why not now? Why not? You know, that's really cool, I think.
I'm slightly disappointed that Balladeer gets to play Cyberpunk. That's annoying. I wish that had happened.
If I could have prevented that, that would have been good. But you know, but it's cool that they've, this happening is a cool thing, you know?
Yeah. And it also gives you a good sort of standard of like, well, if something, you know, that is this cutting edge can look and run like this, then in theory, and then your mind begins to sort of fill in those blanks and go, oh, we could see this, this, this, this, this, or like a very nice polished handheld version of XYZ.
Baldur's Gate 3 maybe, that kind of thing.
Yeah, potentially. Yeah. I mean, you know, they did, they did Divinity Original Sin 2 on there.
I'd actually really like it if they did a proper Witcher 3 update, because I played Witcher 3, the Switch 1 version and like the extra grunt, like helps smooth it out a bit, but it is still like quite a big step back from even like the PS4, Xbox One version. But you're like, if Cyberpunk can look this good, there's no reason the Witcher 3 shouldn't be like, you know, a bit more of a sort of showpiece on here. And that is still a very valid game to play and get excited about.
They'll definitely do that. I'm sure of it. They're so, they seem so committed to getting the stuff on new platforms.
I just, yeah, I just, I don't know. I've seen, I've seen so many publishers over the year, you know, do not a great job of bringing their back catalogue to Wii and then Wii U. I was, yeah, I just, I like, I really like the effort here.
I thought these are people who kind of care a little bit about, you know, how their game is perceived and don't want to like, you know, sell it short for the sake of just being on a platform where it doesn't quite fit and that's, I don't know. I like that.
I like that too.
Maybe that's a bit of a Nintendo magazine take, but.
No, because I think one of the main problems with the Switch in its latter years was shite ports being presented as if they're as valid as other games and I think that, and some developers simply didn't try or they just couldn't get it working to the standard that needed to be. There are some absolutely amazing ports on Switch for sure, like plenty of them, but some that were just in an unforgivable state, some that are so compromised from the, you know, from the home console versions, that it was like, it was annoying seeing that be normalized. So you almost need to see the reverse of that, of like high-end ports for the Switch 2 being normalized, in order for like the lesser ports to just be, I don't know, we kind of need to, we need a bit more prejudice towards shit ports and Switch 2, I think.
Like it's, that needs to be a bit more of an absolutely fucking not like critical response when those things come out. Honestly, I think that was like the number one problem with the Switch, I think. It's just, aside from all of the fake AI games and the dog shit on the store and the clock apps and stuff, it was just that people seeing the Switch as like a quick buck.
Clock apps.
You know what I mean? Or you could just, a game could just perpetually like be in those Steam charts, but not be a great version of it. And it's just stuck there forever and there's no user reviews.
So it never gets like, this is what's good about Steam. The users will fucking tell you, even if the game hasn't got problems, they'll fucking complain, but they'll tell you if a game's got technical problems. And there's nothing like that on Switch.
So you're completely dependent on Nintendo to curate it, and they fucking don't. So really, yeah, I think it's honestly well worth celebrating people who are doing this properly. That sounded weirdly heated for something that I realized is quite innocuous, but I don't know.
It's sort of like, why not do a good job? These are your games. That's why I'm disappointed to hear about Hitman.
Hitman World of Assassination Trilogies, one of our favorite games of all time. It's fucking amazing. What a treat.
What an absolute treat. It should be a slam dunk. So the fact it's not, it's a major whiff, I think.
And doesn't make me optimistic about the very, very good-looking James Bond game that's also coming out on Switch 2. So yeah, I think it's worth making the distinction, Matthew. Anyway, that's enough from me on that.
So you've been playing other games, Sonic X Shadow Generations. I know it's your favorite platformer of all time on other platformers, Matthew. So how do you feel about it coming to Switch 2?
I didn't really follow this at all when it came out on Switch 1 and other platforms. I knew it was a redo of Generations, which was loved, and that there was a Shadow campaign, which I couldn't tell is this good or is this sort of ironically beloved by the weirdos who were really into Sonic. But yeah, I played a decent chunk of this, both the Sonic and Shadow Generations.
Again, on a technical level, I was like, just sort of impressed to see like, oh, this is kind of what the Switch 2 is about, like tech-wise, you know, it kind of takes a few games to get a sense of like, oh, this is what you can do. And, you know, seeing that, you know, quite a handsome, colourful game, playing at like 60 frames, all very slick. The performance mode in Shadows, it takes quite a resolution hit to get there.
But that, you know, not to be too digital foundry about it, I did notice that. But yeah, you know, not a game I was hugely familiar with, but the whole kind of, the fact that every act kind of is a kind of traditional 2D level but made in like a 3D Sonic engine. And then the kind of the more modern Sonic Adventure style of like running into the screen for the second act.
I've never really been into that mode of Sonic, that Sonic Adventure thing doesn't really do it for me. But you know, it all moves very smoothly, it moves super fast, it sounds great, the music's great, the fact that it's pulling on all these retro levels, you know, people don't need like a half-arsed Sonic Generations review from me. But as a Switch 2 thing, again, it was like, yeah, this all works great.
Like this is doing exactly what it's meant to do. You know, it isn't a rough port. I think it is maybe a bit of a shame that people who bought it on Switch 1 haven't got like an easy upgrade route to getting it on Switch 2, other than buying it fresh.
Hopefully that's something that can be sorted out in time. Other companies have done that. Like giving you like a £5 upgrade path or whatever.
But, you know, a strong game that like, you know, if one day it's fucking £5 in a Switch 2 sale, like three years from now, you know, it will work. It will work and it will do exactly what it's meant to do, which it arguably like didn't on Switch 1 from the reviews that I've read. So yeah, I think that's a win.
Yeah, I like Sonic Generations a lot. I think it was definitely the pick of, well, pretty much all the 3D Sonics to me. I mean, because obviously it does have the side scrolling bits as well.
I've not played this new version in much depth, but I am excited to get into it on Switch 2. Like it's, what is horrifying is thinking that the original released in 2011 when I think Sonic was 20 years old, and 14 years have passed since then. So almost the same amount of time again has passed since Sonic Generations.
And like, imagine doing a Sonic Generations 2 about the games that were released in that time period, the Sonic Frontiers level, how cursed that would be. I guess if the Sonic Meini level would be good.
Yeah, it's weird, it doesn't look like a 14 year old game. I mean, obviously this is like the new, you know, remaster, upgrade, whatever, remake, I don't know what they were selling it as, the Generations campaign. But it looks, you know, super sharp, super smooth.
I liked it, I'm just too slow for it, you know, my brain just can't keep up with it. So that's all.
You are right, there's some great music in this. Like the, I would say the best thing that Sonic Unleashed ever contributed to the canon of Sonic were the two versions of the same track that play in this game for those bits of the, those bits of those levels. They're just really like, they're just, yeah, they're just like such, there's some things that Sega are just amazing at and music is really up there.
I realize that probably sounds like a kick in the teeth after me not really passing the Mario Kart soundtrack at all, Matthew, but alas. Okay, then, I accept it's good music. It's just not music I can really, my brain for whatever reason just can't really tune into Mario Kart music.
It's just like a series of noises to me, which I don't feel that way about Mario platformer music or Zelda music. It's just something about Mario Kart where it's just sound to me. Anyway, we don't need to keep talking about that.
Yakuza Zero, Matthew, you've been playing this. I don't think I could play Yakuza Zero again. I really liked it, but the idea of replaying any Yakuza game is a little bit of a, feels a bit like swimming upstream a little bit to me.
But how do you feel about it?
Yeah, again, a really nice, smooth, attractive version of a brilliant game, probably still the best Yakuza game, the one I've had the most fun with. You know, it is such a hard recommend, just as a game that anyone should play. You know, it just comes with that, that same caveat that any, you know, that we've been talking about, which is, you know, yes, you can probably pick up this game for five pounds on most other platforms, you know, or as part of a crazy bundle with loads of Yakuza games.
But again, if you exist only in the Nintendo ecosystem, which I believe a lot of people do, you know, we can see it on our Discord. Like, I know plenty of people who are just devout Nintendo players, you know, should someone who has not played this game, play this game now that is available to them? Yes, I think they should.
Should they play it right now for 50 pounds or whatever it is? You know, maybe not, but it's in there. It's in the eShop, Ether.
At some point it will be a tenner in the Switch 2's lifespan. And maybe that's like a slightly shitty way of framing these games, which is like, great, play it later when it's cheap. You know, or play it now if you really want to play it.
But I think they've put some decent effort into this. I think Sega are pretty good with their past relationship with Nintendo in terms of when they port stuff, they try and add a bit like here, there's some new cutscenes and they've recorded some new voiceover, so there's some like, a little bit of new story content. I can't say I saw a great deal of that, of what I recognized to be new in the time that I played it.
They've also added like this online co-op raid mode, where really the major headline with that is that you can play as like any of the story characters from Yakuza 0, but you have to sort of buy them with the winnings from that mode. But at the start, it gives you like 100 million yen to spend on something. So it's like go out and buy, and it's basically enough to buy one of the characters, so you can have any unlock to begin with.
So obviously I went with Kouzé, the old gangster, who you fight like six times. Yeah, I just wanted to play a sim. So I ran around in the online mode with some people who had Japanese game tags, because I assume this is doing better over there than it is here.
And yeah, we smashed in some goons. It's not a hugely deep mode. The Red Light Raid, I think it's called.
But there's like a tiny glimmer of nerdy joy in getting to play as some quite strange characters. Yeah, I didn't have enough money to unlock a second character. So it's just this like old geezer.
Check out the trailer for this if you haven't, because it's got the three real life actors who play like the ageing gangsters in this advertising the Switch 2 version. And it's just quite amazing to see like how much the character models capture their essence, like how leathery they look in real life. It's like, yeah, very kind of a Martin Kovar adjacent.
Yeah, amazing. Yeah, Kouze is my guy. I like the idea of like multiple Kouze teaming up as well in this red light raid mode.
That's my dream is a whole world of Kouze's. Okay, let's move on then to Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S, Matthew, the last of the ports you've been playing. I've not played this myself yet, but I imagine it's nice to have a puzzle game on Switch 2 at launch.
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the only problem I have with Puyo Puyo Tetris is that I really like Tetris, and I became okay at playing Tetris through Tetris Effect, but I haven't had that same kind of religious awakening with Puyo Puyo, like I'm quite bad at it. And so, you know, you can play infinite variations of both those two game types, but like if you want to play the story campaign, it's going to like make you...
You have to be good at both basically. And I am so bad at Puyo Puyo, I just don't get it. I don't really know how to play it properly.
Like it takes me like 10 minutes, and I get like a D grade on every level to win around. Tetris, like I'm just dropping those things, you know, I've got a muscle memory from Tetris Effect. Probably the most notable thing about this, I mentioned it earlier, is it does have the GameShare functionality, so if you've got one copy, you know, you can play all the multiplayer, co-op modes, whatever, from that one copy by sharing it with a friend, you know, through this screen streaming thing.
So if you didn't have any of the older games that they've patched it into, and you were interested in seeing that feature, you know, this is probably the best way to test it. But again, yeah, quite handsomely made. You know, it's PiO Pi Tetris, it's got nice anime graphics, it all looks very sharp on the screen.
It isn't doing a lot of heavy lifting, but yeah, decent.
Yeah, okay, cool. Well, I look forward to digging into it myself as well, Matthew. So, like, we've got a couple more points to discuss here, but I think maybe there's another time we can talk about some of this stuff.
But with the Switch 2, Nintendo has made a pretty, I think, pretty amazing effort to update a load of old games to existing Switch games, to run better on the new hardware, whether it's a bump in frame rate, more commonly a bump in resolution, I think, just looking a bit crisper. And you know, you've been diving deep here. I've played a bit of Tears of the Kingdom and think it looks fantastic.
I would possibly wonder if they could maybe do like a color correction pass on the Switch 2 versions, like maybe just make a bit more out of the... I don't know, I just wasn't quite... There's a couple of things about the colors that felt a bit muted to me when I was playing Tears of the Kingdom on the kind of screen.
I was just like, I'm not sure if this could maybe use a bit of a color pass. I can't quite explain what I mean there, but just looked a bit, a little bit muddier in places than I remembered. But anyway, otherwise, incredibly impressive.
I put them side by side. Really just like an amazing way to discover these games. Those are paid upgrades, but obviously they're free with the Nintendo Switch Online expansion pack subscription tier.
But Matthew, you've been playing more of these. Is there anything you wanted to say about the games you've been diving deep into from your Switch back catalog?
The game that isn't patched but just gets a natural boost that impressed me the most is Bayonetta 3, which throws around some absolutely giant monsters. It's the one where Bayonetta can kind of control her giant kind of summons. So they fight alongside her and it was a bit of a sideshow on Switch 1 and it definitely undermined what they were going for.
So seeing that just run without a hiccup, without seemingly any kind of update, that's quite impressive. I'd be interested to see if Platinum go into any of their games and give them a lick of paint because some of them got a little bit… they struggled, shall we say, in places.
Of the Nintendo ones, I can't quite put my finger on what they've done with Mario Kart Odyssey. It might just be like a resolution boost, but it looks so sharp and so handsome on my 4K TV, and it is super impressive, though interestingly, playing alongside Mario Kart World, I have… You do realise, like, what a step up Mario Kart World actually is.
Like visually, there's just a lot more going on. And like, I'm not saying Mario Kart Odyssey looks bad at all. It doesn't.
But you can see that, like, you can see a generational divide that didn't exist before. Same with Bowser's Fury. You know, it's really smooth now.
They've sorted out any framerate problems, the draw distance on it, all that stuff. Absolutely sings on Switch 2. But it does look just a little simpler all around, you know, in its level of detail and geometry and all this kind of stuff.
You know, when you've been in Mario Kart World, you're like, okay, there's some extra juice here that we're going to get to see. And that's exciting because you begin to imagine what all the jumps are going to be in the future.
Mm, absolutely. I mean, I'm actually curious to see Bayonetta 3 in action. I'm quite glad I left Heroes of the Kingdom now for Switch 2.
I played 23 hours of it at launch. But yeah, I'm quite enticed by the idea of playing a prettier version of it. And really great to just have these on day one.
I mean, however you feel about Nintendo just launching with Mario Kart World and Matthew's beloved Welcome Tour, there's also the idea that there's bound to be one of these games they've updated that you haven't played. There's bound to be something or something sat in your back catalog or your library that you've not touched. And the idea you can go back to it and it suddenly has more value.
It's just really, really cool. It's awesome that they did that. And so many of them are free.
I mean, there are some paid ones and yeah, but it's good.
It's a feature I've loved of like Xbox and PlayStation as well. You know, like PlayStation 5, what a treat when it goes to Sashima. It was just like 60 frames out of the box, you know, and on Xbox when they go back.
Like it's the best magic trick a platform holder can do. It's just make you re-evaluate your library a little bit. And so it goes here.
Absolutely. So final point for this episode, Matthew, final discussion topic, any doubts or notes of optimism going to the next 12 months of the Switch 2?
They just got to start announcing the games. Just got to show us what they're going to do. You know, like there are apparently another three or four games that are due out this year for Switch 2.
You know, Kirby Air Riders, the new Hyrule Warriors, a couple of other things, the Kirby update, I guess. But like we just haven't seen them. I would love them just to give us a direct and just go like next year we've got you kind of covered as well.
You know, like there's a lot of stuff to be excited about. Will Donkey Kong land? Will it be good?
Will it be an all-timer? Will it be a disaster?
Will it kill Astro Bot?
Who knows?
You know, that's the key thing, isn't it, Matthew?
Will it kill Astro Bot? I don't know. But I am, yeah, as you can hear from this episode, I am very much all in on Switch 2.
I'm having a great time. I'm loving revisiting the back catalog. I'm really interested to see if Nintendo do more Switch 2 upgrade packs and keep a generation of games ticking over while they work on the next ones.
Like, what does a Pitman 4 upgrade look like with a load of new stuff in it? What else could they do? Because I think the job they've done with Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the World is nice.
So, yeah, it just gets your mind thinking, oh, what would this be? What would that be? But let's wait and see.
Indeed. And so for me, I think I will echo what I said earlier, which is I'm a bit nervous about all these games costing 60 quid plus this generation. I think that there's some games that just simply will not suit.
I don't know about the idea of charging 60 quid for a new Fire Emblem game. I'm not sure that's maybe a good idea. I think as it's quite noticeable, the difference in production values between a game like Breath of the Wild and a game like Fire Emblem, the last one that came out a few years ago.
There's just a gulf in what they spent on it. So what you charge for it should match that to some degree, I think. If for Nintendo as a first-party publisher, like it's okay for some of these games to be 50 quid rather than like 60 quid as the base price.
But like WarioWare for more than 40 quid begins to be like, that's a game that has always been about that much.
Yeah, that's it. And it's like, I don't know, there's value to keeping things there. Sometimes it's okay to focus on quantity more than like per se or what you're making.
I just hope they're thinking about that stuff because it is, I think it is like a... Nintendo has historically, I think, been a bit of a... The consoles you buy for budget conscious gamers, I think it's maybe a bit...
Sorry, I'll use the word gamer, which I never fucking say. That's how late it is, us recording this. Budget focused like players, like it's...
I think that's definitely been part of their audience. So I just hope they're thinking about this stuff. There's got to be somewhere between that 70 quid for Mario Kart and 8 quid for Switch 2 Welcome Tour, Matthew.
In that hinterland, hopefully we can purchase a few games from Nintendo.
No, there can only be those two extremes.
I can't wait to talk about Donkey Kong Bonanza, because I think if that's bad, that's going to be such a funny episode. But nonetheless, I'm excited to discuss it.
Great, I love that you're anticipating me having a breakdown.
No, I'm not. I would much prefer the game to be good, because it's going to be probably at this rate, the only physical game I buy this generation on Switch 2. So yeah, I look forward to discussing it, Matthew.
This was a fun episode. I enjoyed it. Where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky.
