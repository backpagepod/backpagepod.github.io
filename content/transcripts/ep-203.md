Hello and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello Matthew, how is your Sunday going when we're recording this? Mid-afternoon on a Sunday, it's 4pm, so the sun's basically fucked off. Yeah, it's classic sort of end of year weekend fare.
How's it going?
It's going fine. My cat came into the house and was mysteriously damp. And we've been trying to work out why this cat is mysteriously damp and seems slightly agitated.
So that's been my afternoon.
Are you trying to do the Golden Idol Clue Star thing where you tap on the cat and it's just like you just have to examine all the cat related details and then lock it?
Yes, all the nouns and verbs come out of it. Whiskers, fur, tail, damp. Yeah, no, it's more like Doctor House trying to diagnose what's wrong with a patient.
Probably lupus.
It's more like a diagnostician role. I think it might be a rare case of falling in a pond.
How unusual, but I guess not impossible in bath. So that makes sense. I don't think the cat was like hosed down with a super soaker or something by the students nearby.
The thing is, you say that, one of the first things that did come to mind is, has someone sprayed some stuff on this because it went in their garden like a bastard? Because that does happen. People are pricks.
I could imagine doing that to an animal. Not even when I was a kid when I hosed down a cat.
Don't worry. I was about to tell you a really depressing anecdote and decided against it.
Okay. Is that about time you hosed down a dog or something? That seems like something you would have done.
A fellow journalist's cat got terrorized by some fucker. It was horrible. Anyway, whatever.
Let's keep the move up.
Yeah, sorry. I'll explain what this podcast is then. Because I originally had how Games Magazines die as an episode in The Plan.
Sounded depressing, but I had a good plan for it. However, we did have a little think on it. There's another episode idea we've wanted to do for a while.
Cass, who's the guest in the second part of this episode, originally pitched coming on the podcast to us at the end of last year when they were doing the Kickstarter for Profound Waste of Time Issue 4. And we sent me and Matthew a load of free magazines. Very nice, obviously a very generous thing to do.
And so I did promise Cass an episode. And so we have circled back to finally do that this year. But we thought we would merge that with the idea we already had, which is talking about the state of games magazines a little bit.
And this was prompted by Play Magazine closing quite recently. And, you know, obviously games magazines are kind of a preoccupation of ours on this podcast. It's an interesting time as well.
I think a profound waste of time is, I think it is fair to say it's the first in the line of what now seems to be a trend of like prestige, high-end games magazines, like Lock-On from Lost in Cult is one, On Magazine is another one that sort of like launched recently from some former edge people and it sort of like seems to be a trend. So I thought it would made sense to sort of try and put those two things into one episode and talk about it Matthew. So does that make sense to you as like an idea?
So like we're talking about the end of a certain kind of magazine and the arrival and birth of a new kind of magazine. And I don't I think that's, I actually think you couldn't have planned it better really.
And hopefully not the end of those certain types of magazines already like. But like, yeah, definitely sort of a slightly different era of direct to consumer magazine and cutting out the WH. Smith sort of man in the middle element of it and the kind of traditional newsstand side of things, which has been hairier and hairier.
So yeah, the life and death of magazines, the death and life of magazines, I think, is what I've ultimately called it. It's really more realistic than anything. This has been a brutal year for media more generally.
As Google deranks smaller sites, it doesn't seem like a great time for ad-supported trad websites, people get angry, e-coms links, and literally any way the websites make money, users complain about. So launching a new ad-supported website now basically seems pointless. You basically need some element of user support.
You know, obviously we have Patreon for our podcast, which we're very grateful for. The internet in 2024 is so awful. Magazines are weirdly more viable financially if you can actually make them work.
There's an upfront cost that pays for the thing. That's what's always been good about magazines. And the reader gets something nice out of it, a nice physical object to enjoy and admire.
But like I say, Trad magazine channels have been dying off for years. Certainly the time me and Matthew were in those content mines. And there's less and less shelf space in like supermarkets more generally that the magazines that are left are fighting for.
So like I say, most recently Play closed. And it was the last remaining single format games mag in the UK. Those mags are how myself and Matthew got into writing more generally.
So this whole subject area is what we're going to talk about. It feels relevant to us. Basically a load of stuff set up tapes together for an episode idea, but I think it works.
So this part, you got us talking about the state of games magazines and the challenges that they faced and what it's like when games magazines closed generally. I haven't worked on a magazine that actually closed down while I was working on it, but got pretty close to it, got to the hairy magazine times where sales are down and it becomes more logistically challenging to put them together. Matthew is obviously the closer and has to...
I don't want to keep making jokes about that because it does suggest that you are the cause when you're obviously not. So you're just there at the tail end of some challenging times for the respective mediums like the consoles basically that are tides to those magazines. So yeah, lots to talk about.
Second part we'll chat to Cass about a profound waste of time. Matthew for Issue 3 interviewed Shu Takumi. Really nice looking, cool piece that Matthew put together.
Drove him absolutely spare putting it together. I remember what a struggle that was for you, Matthew. One of the many tough times you've had writing things in recent years.
So excited to get into that. But yeah, I suppose Matthew to kick us off. What do you remember about the state of Games Magazines when you got into print media versus when you left it?
That's about a 10 year span, right?
Yes. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah, so came into print media 2006.
People would say that's already past like the golden age. And maybe that's true in terms of reputation or the kind of just the sort of giddiness around print and the fact that they were like the first port of call. And, you know, that that era might have been over.
But in terms of actual numbers, magazines were still going pretty strong. Like every format had, I'd say, at least three rival magazines. I mean, that was Nintendo, there was NGamer, there was Revolution over at Imagine, and there was Official Nintendo Magazine, you know.
And for everyone else, I think there were like four Xbox mags and four PlayStation mags, at least. And so, like, it felt really busy. And certainly working at Future, you know, given that online had begun to eat people's lunch but hadn't, like, fully eaten the lunch, I guess, you know, Future had GamesRadar, probably that was it, I think.
And they were quite a small team. Like, to look around the offices, you would have thought, print's in a pretty good space. There's a lot of magazines.
They're well supported. Even the smaller mags have, like, decent sized teams. Online doesn't have a big presence at this company or it doesn't feel like it has a big presence.
Obviously, by the time mags ended, I guess, you're probably down to about half those magazines in 10 years, accelerated pretty quickly towards the end. I wouldn't say that was a gradual drip, drip. It was, it all happened quite quickly.
And, you know, PC Gamer, the website was on the rise. GamesRadar team was much bigger. You know, Future had certainly recalibrated itself.
If, if anything, I'd say by the time, within those 10 years, online kind of supplanted magazines, you know, pretty fully, but were also on the way to being supplanted by other things themselves. Like that's how fast everything began moving. You know, like YouTube was beginning to become like quite a big thing and video and influencers, you know, the end of giant sort of monoliths who owned the whole scene.
You know, it felt like we were already kind of into that era. Did that sort of reflect how it was for you?
Yeah, I think so. It's funny because I, I too thought when I joined magazines, the Golden Age was already over and then didn't realize how over it could be. Right.
As the next 10 years progress and like games magazines do live on. But we go from like, excuse me, just choked on the remains of a ham sandwich. What a way to go.
Oh my God. I just hope this isn't how you go out.
During an episode that I've like half conceived and I'm sort of doing off the cuff. Yeah. So, you know, these are games magazines that when I joined were selling 30,000 plus issues, which is amazing.
Just think about each one being five pounds in the case of play. That's just five quid you're making that doesn't go in anyone's pocket, except WH. Smith and yours or whichever retail is in the middle.
Magazine subscriber base, you know, Play magazine was not the highest selling one either. Like there were magazines that were selling better than that. And then by the time I left magazines, I felt like everything was selling about 10k.
And when you get to like 7k range, that's when games magazines basically closed down. When it's like they just, you know, I don't know what the economics are like now because I understand that the price of paper was absolutely fucked by the pandemic. But that's so like that it's actually more expensive to make magazines than it used to be because you just can't get paper as easy as you could.
I don't know if that's relieved in recent years, but certainly based on the price of fucking baked beans, nothing seems to have gone back down in price over the last few years. So, yeah, I think I was I was definitely noticing in real time that like people on Eurogamer were getting more respect at games events than me. I could definitely see that happen.
You know what I mean? I could see that happening. Like it was it was like a firm change that was occurring.
But you're right. It happened so, so quickly.
It's like a thin skin barometer, isn't it? When the skin's that thin, you feel every change quite intensely.
Well, that's it. It's because like, yeah, because I guess you just have a lot of professional pride tied up in being a staff writer on a games magazine. Yeah, so that happened.
But you are right. Like the 10 years you described, there's a huge acceleration there. GamesRadar is a very big website now.
That's a genuine success that they've made out of that, like turning it into this multimedia thing. And PC Gamer is obviously a huge success too. And they've got a bunch of different video stuff they do on the event side that makes money as well.
So that is actually quite a good example of a resilient, viable business. They've built up in a quite precarious age. The rise of influences and stuff like that.
There's a lot of different places that games marketing budgets go now that aren't just like advertising and magazines and websites. So that has changed massively. And yeah, it's funny, it was a relatively short space of time.
But like you say, everything changed many times over. Yeah, but obviously the thing I just felt like is everything was not on its last legs, but we were the titans of games magazines on PC Gamer and OXM relatively speaking. And then you just think 10 years earlier how many Xbox magazines there were, there were like four or five, and like there were three PlayStation, four PlayStation magazines.
And then 10 years hence, there's one of each of those things.
Yeah.
And they didn't even, you know, like the OXM did shut and then the OPM did not remain, the official magazine, that changed. It just like, yeah, it just went away so quickly.
I mean, you know, it was a great indicator of like how these things were perceived. I remember when I think the writing was on the wall for NGamer, maybe a bit earlier than people think, like when it was NGamer. But NRevolution, I think it had rebranded to NRevolution at that point closed.
And Nintendo themselves sort of stepped up a little bit. I can't speak to the exact deal. I wasn't the editor at the time or a publisher or anything like that.
But they definitely helped finance NGamer because they didn't want to be the first platform with only one magazine.
Right, right.
Magazines were important enough that Nintendo would do that for NGamer. But yeah, NGamer's life was extended as an unofficial magazine by Nintendo a little bit. Certainly enough to get into the Nintendo gamer era of it for a few issues.
So magazines, they were perceived even though this was a time where things were beginning to get a bit hairy.
That's really interesting. I mean, that was the first. Imagine could have run a magazine on pennies basically.
They could really like, and they did. I think NREV was one guy and a freelance pot at the end. It was selling probably mid thousands, like five, six thousand or something like that.
But they stuck with Xbox and PlayStation magazines for years longer than they stuck with Nintendo. So definitely said something about how challenging that market was that you were working in. So this is the interesting question, Matthew.
I think we talked about this a little bit before, but what happens to a games magazine before it closes? What is that? What happens in the change over from like, what looks like the golden age of that staff size and the output versus what the end looks like?
So I would say that the big indicators that we hit on NGamer was, there was suddenly more meddling from publishers. Suddenly there was a bit of interest in it and we weren't left entirely to our own devices and that spoke to, you know, something has changed or it's got to a point where people are looking for kind of more dramatic solutions. That's an indicator something's happening.
The big one is definitely staff shrinkages. On NGamer, that happened very aggressively because Future merged the three unofficial magazines that they had, us, XBox World 360 and PSM3 into like a mega team. You know, I've talked about this before, the thing called The Studio.
So that was basically more of a production line that was producing these three magazines. PSM3 and XBox World 360 had it a little worse than us in that they were literally sharing content between the two mags, which I always thought was quite unholy as a concept, given that they were very, like, you know, platform champions. NGamer, obviously, we couldn't share any content with anyone because we didn't have any of their games, you know, we were completely different.
So we were slightly kind of sort of inoculated from that, which was great. Yeah, so Staff Cut Sounds, you know, I remember the horrible time, you know, they let Martin Kitts, Andy McGregor and Kim Bissix, who are our two artists, art editor and dep art ed, they all went in a go. And that was like, oh, this thing's really, really fucked.
But then it still like lived on for another two years after that. I guess in terms of like day to day, another indicator that something's gone is going wrong is like when like adverts dry up and things like that. Oh, we've got to fill more pages and it tends to coincide with you having like smaller budgets as well, like freelance budgets begin to get smaller.
You just sense the company trying to do the same thing for less, like everywhere, you know, every element of the magazine. You know, if the paper stock can get cheaper, it will. If the staff, KEDCount can get smaller, it will.
If the freelance budget will get smaller, it will. A lot of it is like just how much can you kind of keep up with those new reduced standards? And it feels like as long as you can keep up, you'll be safe.
You know, maybe that's for another answer, but it feels like they psychologically shift quite a lot onto you. Sort of survive or die in these conditions.
Yeah, I remember the sort of like I wasn't there when it closed, but it was close to closing when I was on it. But Play Magazine, when I joined it in 2007, it was three full time staff and an EIC who edited it. And then when I was running it in 2012, five years later, it was me and a staff writer.
And then when the staff writer left to go do something else, it was me and a pot of money. And it was 130 page mag that became 100 page mag. And then I think we still had the fucking DVD, which was such a time sink.
I don't even know what purpose a DVD would have served in 2012. But I think I was still doing commentaries and capture for it. God knows how I had time for that.
The answer is I didn't. And I was very tired.
Did you hate having to feed that shit? Like, did you ever have to explain to the readers that these things were happening? Because, you know, I remember there being like, you know, when they decided to finally cut the DVDs or whatever from various magazines, there comes the day you have to do the editor's column where you're like, oh, actually, this is a good thing that you're paying the same amount for less.
And that stuff's horrible.
I don't remember. I think they might have just like pretended it didn't happen. I think PC Gamer had to do it when they cut their demo disc.
That happened before I joined.
Right.
That made even more sense to cut that because Steam demo. I mean, why would you even bother? Which is fair enough.
But no, I don't remember having to do that. But otherwise, it's like the whole thing is the grand facade of making sure that people still believe the magazine is as good as it's always been. And hiding that, that is the real art of the magazine in decline.
It's like, you have a staff page that's got a slot for you, the editor, writing your foreword, and then like three or four slots for like people. And only like two of those are going to be like full-time staff. One will be like a sub-editor and a designer or maybe a staff writer.
And then it'll be like some fucking rando freelancer, basically.
It has powerful Netflix trying to convince you that Mike Tyson at 58 is fit to get in a ring. And you're like, I'm not buying this, man. The guy looks pretty old and bad.
Yeah. So I was going to ask you, actually, when will you be stepping into the ring with Logan Paul, Matthew? Is that on the card soon or what's that going to be, dad?
I would honestly, for the amount of money, I wouldn't make him any money because who gives a fuck? You know, I can't really see how they'd dress that up and make it valuable for his audience, unless it's like he's just gonna probably kill a stranger. And if the stranger somehow lives, we'll give him three million pounds or something.
That's the thing. I just don't think I'd pull in those kind of numbers.
Yeah. I don't even know which one is the one who's had a fight, Logan Paul or Jake Paul. I just assume they're the same fucking guy.
Or when you play, it's like a near-automated boss battle. It's like, oh yeah, these are the evil blonde twins. You're like, okay, fine, I'll just fuck them up with this big sword or whatever.
Anyway, I don't know how we got on to this. So yeah, so it's that thing of like, it is challenging, but you just do your best to make it as good as it always can be. And so, you know, because you want it to be as good as now as it is in their memory of it when it was like, I don't know, seven or eight people working on it, which is particularly true on PC Gamer.
I suppose that is the question, Matthew. How hard is it to make a games magazine that's about to close versus one that's thriving? Like what is the penalty to you as a person trying to make this good?
It's all about like your personal sliding scale of what's acceptable to you because if you are trying to maintain an element of what it once was, that will break you and has broken loads of people and I think probably broke both of us at some point. That's where you end up working crazy into the night or over weekends and you're like, well, I literally just don't have the resources for it to be better where wiser people will probably tell you to just let it go a bit. It's not your fault.
It's beyond you now. I definitely had people tell me that at several stages, people who are still in games now and have lasted much longer in magazines, more senior people just say, you know, you just have to adjust your personal expectations for what you can make. But the problem with games magazines is that they tend to recruit highly passionate people who are very proud of the thing that they've put all their time into.
You know, I probably had that less with OXM, to be honest, because I felt that was more like, that was more like a job in that I'd just been put on to that magazine. But definitely official Nintendo. Like, I feel like I was going quite kind of hell for leather on that, trying to make it, you know, just not make it feel cheap or pointless or like a sad end.
I didn't want to go out with like some bad magazines. I wanted to be able to point to the last things I'd worked on, which I thought he was going to be and say, well, that was good to the better end. At least I have that.
But yeah, like, I don't know really. People gave a fuck ultimately, which is kind of depressing. People who listen to this podcast do, which is nice.
But in the grand scheme of things, yeah, I don't think anyone noticed.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I've got like a further question to ask on that front, which I think I'll save for when we talk about some of the stuff going on now. Yeah, that's kind of what I remember as well.
It's just like, it's really, really hard. When it was like one, when it was just me on play and there was a month where I wrote like 48 pages or something, it was just like, it's just, it just cannot have been good. And I never, I never really, I never really thought play was amazing while I worked on it anyway, like it had its moments, but it felt, there was an iteration of it slightly before when I started working there in about 0405, which is kind of when I really liked it.
And then it just sort of like, it became a slightly more anodyne looking thing in the PS3 era, and I just didn't quite have the same love for it. Plus, while I worked on it, it was like everyone on the Xbox Mags was like, hey, Lost Odyssey. And that's not actually true, like they didn't actually say Lost Odyssey.
But people were just really excited about the platform and Halo gears, Fable, all that stuff. Whereas as documented many times as podcasts, PlayStation 3 was not that. And then by the end of the PS3 generation, it was very much a case of, well, what am I going to put on this cover?
It's like, I've got DMC, I've got Revengeance, and I've got the vague whiff of MGS5 coming at some point. And then New Tomb Raider, which has already been on the cover once. So it was like, it was just really...
That's how you end up doing a Lightning Returns cover, you know? Which is...
This was a Shaggy Dog story to how we got a Lightning Returns cover.
Well, that's the kind of thinking that goes into it. And it's sort of like, you start re-planning sections around what is achievable. And it's like, well, this one page that's got a big bit of key art and a few captions is a lot easier to write than this 450-word chunky news page that probably doesn't have much purpose anyway, because why are we doing news on a magazine in the modern age?
So, yeah, those are the kind of questions that you ask. But it definitely becomes a case of, yeah, like you say, paper stock goes down, freelance budget going down is the main one. That's where, because all that happens when you lose staff and you lose freelance budget is you're going to have to work harder.
That's the only takeaway from it. There's no other conclusion to draw. It's just this is on you.
You have to find a way to do this and we're not going to help you. This is just what you've got. So good luck.
And that was, I think the extra pressure I had, definitely not on ONM and OXM was, you know, we recruited young staff writers and as well as wanting to kind of keep the magazine standards high, part of me wanted them to have the same good experience that I'd had on games magazines. And it was just a very different place, you know, working on ONM in 2013 or whatever, wasn't like working on NGamer in 2006. And it was kind of demented to try and even get close to that.
You know, just the vibes were so different. And, you know, trying to kind of keep morale up and try to kind of create the atmosphere that allows fun magazines to be made in, you know, fun magazines tend to come from teams that are having fun. And that was, that was like, increasingly hard.
But, you know, you don't want to just recruit someone into some fucking hellscape, you know, that's so depressing. But maybe, yeah, I don't know. Hopefully they had fun, those three people I recruited.
Hopefully my various breakdowns were worth it for them.
I think everyone always enjoyed working with you. Like I, you know, I'm friends with someone who worked with you on the, your last days of OXM and only had like nice things to say about you and your leadership. So I think that's good.
I think you made that experience very pleasant for those people. So I wouldn't worry about that. But yeah, I know what you mean.
Like it's like, I would like you to have a little taste of what it was like when you could have a week where you just log, you know, you file six pages and that's okay. And it's not like 10 or 12 pages and it's not.
You just get to play an amazing new game for a week. Just actually like think on it. Just have some fun.
Sit in the games cage with your feet up for three days. Like, I don't know, everyone deserves that for the how shitty little money they're on.
Yeah, that is it. Like it's, if you take that away, you start to ask like, what am I actually doing it for, I think? So it's true.
And it's like, especially in the online age where it's like your rewarders' assholes on Twitter pelting you with, you know, dickish comments basically. Just a hostile audience at all times. I think like the incentives disappear a little bit.
You get further and further away from, you know, what, you know, the dream of doing it in the noughties was when we got into it. And yeah, so, okay, a bit of negativity there to kick us off. But that is what that is what it's like.
It's just managed, that's what managed decline is like. It's, magazine sales only ever go down unless you're in an ultra niche. And even then, no one has really grown magazine sales in recent years.
I think that RetroGamer is quietly very successful and has a strong subscriber base, partly because the product is ideal for a collector minded reader who is, you know, perfect to buy magazines. And there's also no Retro IGN or Eurogamer that eats their lunch. That was the thing with working on PlayStation and Xbox magazines, is that, you know, you could just go and read Eurogamer or IGN and you would get a lot of the same stuff.
And that was the challenge as well. OK, so I think we've kind of like covered the psychic damage aspect of running a magazine when sales are going down, Matthew.
One thing I would say I didn't quite cover when we're talking about psychic damage is the sudden involvement or the sudden extra interest of like more senior staff. The idea that someone has the answers is just not true. No one could reverse the decline of certain products.
Like, I honestly think that and that isn't defeatist. It's just true, especially when, you know, like on basically on OXM, because that was the generation that that Xbox One was was, you know, not doing as well compared to PlayStation. And there was a very clear divide in how OPM was performing and how OXM was performing.
And, you know, we just weren't the stuff. We just didn't have the juice at the time. And try and the idea that with the right combination of words in a cover line, I could somehow like change that trend.
It just wasn't true. And I've always hated that like level of cover analysis of like, well, let's put this on here. And you're like, I just, I just don't think any of this is, this really makes a difference from like the, you know, I get, you know, I am into the art and the science of games magazines.
And I love that people take pride in the granular details. But when it becomes like, you're going to live or die based on those granular details, I just don't believe that. And having meetings with publishers to talk about like the next cover that's coming up and this, that and the other and feeling like whatever you think about this, it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
And whatever you suggest isn't going to be right.
It's like you might be able to do one shout to your cover that will maybe sell like a hundred copies more than something else. Like if you got like a hundred, you decide we're going to do a hundred greatest games of all time out of nowhere and just fucking stick that on top left. Maybe that will do better for a minute.
Yeah, so many people, the big thing. And I still heard some of this when I was on my RPS and it was being thrown around with websites, was the idea of like, if you can't secure a big exclusive, you've got to make a big event happen that your magazine owns. That was like a huge thing.
People kept talking about like trying to come up with like, it's the Hot 100 or whatever or this, that, the idea that you could sort of, you set the agenda and I also didn't really believe in that.
Yeah.
I mean, one or two thing, like definitely, PC Gamer's top 100 games every year. That's a thing. It's on the calendar.
I imagine people look forward to it. It feels like an event when it happens.
Yeah. Always represents a bump in the magazine sales, as you would expect, and they tend to promote those issues as well, so they do better in Smiths or whatever.
But you can only do that once a year. That is the beat, right? It's like the best there ever was, and maybe a preview beat, the best there's going to be.
Outside of that, it's like we tried to do so many, like it's the Mario issue and you're like, they're all the fucking Mario issue. You're a Nintendo magazine. What else is there?
It's the sports issue. It's because it's got Mario Tennis and Mario Golf. Like, oh, depressing.
At least when it comes to website audience development, there are smart people who work in that field, who understand what Google is doing at the moment, even if it might stab you in the back later and change their minds about what works and what doesn't work on a dime, and you won't really understand why that happened, which seems to be what's happened to a lot of people in the last few years, anecdotally. But the idea that people have answers in magazines, I saw, I won't say who it was, but someone who said while I was running this magazine, the sales actually went up, they never went down. I was like, you might as well say, when I stood outside these 30 days in a row, I stopped the rain from falling.
There was no rain those days because I stood in this field. That is what you're saying. You're just like, all that's happening is something that's not related to you, something that is larger than you, probably the sales of the console in question.
They are creating that environment where something can do slightly better than it was. No one has the fucking answers for that stuff. It is agonizing to hear it.
It's like, why don't you just trust my expertise that I'm making this good? Why don't we just all understand this won't last forever? I get the thing of you have to ask the question of, well, what can we do?
Fair enough. But when it leads to suggestions, all it does is sour everyone who's involved.
Yeah, it felt like, to me, success was holding the line, and what you just didn't want to do, you wouldn't give away, you didn't want to dip because of something stupid. There were obviously games you wouldn't put on the cover because not because they were toxic, there was just no audience footprint for it. But I think I knew that.
I didn't need to be told that and I wouldn't have tried putting those deadly games on the cover. But the idea that there was a magic fix-it bullet, it's just not true. The best you can do is just try and soothe it on its way out.
Yeah. I think that actually, this is why I think the last five or so years of Edge are just some of my favorite years of Edge, because the covers are so like them. In recent years, I feel like every Edge cover is like what an Edge cover should be.
It's like we think this thing matters and we've got a story inside that will tell you why this matters, and that is so much better than someone coming in and going, you know, Roblox is huge, right? Why don't we do a Roblox cover, which is what those kinds of conversations, that's what the kind of suggestions would be, and you would just put your head in your hands like, but none of us care, so why are we doing it? Well, it is like that though, isn't it?
It's like, why are we pretending this is important to us when it's not, and it's sort of like, and surely your readers will see through it as well as. I know if Edge did a Roblox cover, it'd be like, this is really weird that you've done this, but Expedition 33 cover, that is a total edge game to me. Japanese RPG made by ex-UBsoft people, totally a good fit.
So, yeah, that's the thing. I think resisting that thinking at all costs is the best thing that can be done. Soothe it on the way out, it's such a funny way to put it, but it is like that.
Okay then, so this has been bleak so far. I think it's just because this is like, these are by far the worst parts of working on Games Magazines. It's thinking about this stuff, living through those times.
It's like, you just know it's never going to get better, it's only going to get worse. It's hard to work in any environment where you feel that way. That's just a fact.
So, okay, so I think to turn the subject towards something a little bit more positive, Matthew, do you have any thoughts on the future of magazines and what about independent media more generally?
Again, I appreciate that there are still monthly magazines being made and the ones that exist are, you know, definitely successful enough and are doing good things. I mean, when I think of magazines and, you know, if I ever had involvement in them again, which I don't really necessarily see that happening, but you do think more about the kind of independent media side of it and what's happening there and the fact that there does seem to be an appetite for it. You know, weirdly, people who would have bought, you know, a magazine every month for a year, ten years ago, they might actually spend £30 a couple of times a year on a artisan mag.
I haven't really got a good name for this. We've definitely got to ask Kaz about this when we talk to him. It's like what he actually calls a profound waste of time, because that tier of…
Journal. Is it journal?
Is it a journal? Is that the thing people go for?
I thought it was, but maybe it's…
Because I always call them, in my head, I always think artisan mag, but I don't know what that means really. Like an artisan baguette at prep?
A bold, independent magazine.
They're hard to eat, like an artisan baguette from prep, because they're on such good paper stock. You are not eating, a profound waste of time. Again, this is going to sound really bleak, and apologies if anyone who works on these magazines listens to them.
I don't really know what I would do if I was in charge of any of them. I've had definitely a conversation about returning to print in the last four years, and I had a really hard think about it, and thought, I just can't really do it. But that's partly because I'm just a bit of a coward, and I've been through it slightly too many times to do it again.
I didn't want to come in and close another famous magazine, because yeah, it just becomes a habit at one point. My thoughts really don't extend much beyond like, I'm glad they exist, I'm glad that future mags are still there, and definitely to my outsider perspective, of holding up the quality. They don't seem compromised internally, are they?
I don't know, I'd have to ask the people who worked on them, like, are they a fucking nightmare to work? Edge has definitely burned through quite a few editors, which would suggest it is hard, I imagine it is hard. But you know, I like the magazine that comes out as a result.
Likewise, I think the way PC Gamer navigates, like the split between online and print, and reusing stuff in print. There was a time where people suggested online material going in a magazine, and you were like, well, it's all over, what's the fucking point? But that was like six years ago, and those magazines are still here.
They've either struck the balance well, or there is just an audience who would just rather consume stuff written down, and so good for them. It's a tough one. This is where you're going to come out with something brilliant that made me look really dumb.
Well, not necessarily. The thing is, I hear something that's going to sound really bleak, right? But really, what games media needs is to be funded independently.
But games writers are never put in a position where they can build a strong enough personal brand that they can turn on the crowdfunding tab, and people will turn around and support them. Because by design, those brands are designed to develop and spotlight themselves and not the people. And therefore, the people lack the clout to be able to do that.
So it's like this actually, it's quite, I think it's not too doom and gloom, but I think that's a very real thing. I think that, weirdly, I think that if, this sounds so random, I'm sorry to bring her into this, but if someone like Lucy James launched a magazine, they would, you know, she would do better. I think launching that than someone who has worked in print for like 15 years would.
Yeah, I see what you're talking about. They've got a big online footprint.
Yeah, so this is like, you know, obviously like Lucy's very well known in games, but I'm making the point that basically, and you know, obviously making video and podcasts is what Lucy does, different sort of like field. But what I'm saying is that, you know, working in video does allow you to build a personal brand and for people to know who you are and for you to become significant in that field in a way that you just never are when you're working on a magazine or a website. You are just so anonymous.
Definitely in the UK especially.
Yeah, that's it. And I find this not the same thing that happens in sports writing. It's like, of all the kind of like interesting people who have followed me on Twitter in recent months, I'm quite intrigued by the fact that athletic writer, Karl Anker, started following me on there.
And he's got very good bants, I would say. Like his feed is very, very strong. But like he's also so well known to the people.
Like athletic is all about like these writers are tied to like specific football clubs and will write about that one football club and like will cultivate this massive following around that. And it's a really powerful thing because it also gives them enough currency that if they have to, they could launch their own things and be moderately successful because people know who they are, they know what they're selling. And it feels like games media by designers stopped that from ever happening.
Like I'm not saying it's necessarily anything nefarious to it, but you know, and you can say that like, you know, the faces of my face was in the front of PC Gamer for years. Like it's, you know, that's me being given prominence to build a brand. What did that result in?
About, I don't know, 5000 Twitter followers. It's not massive, but it's something. It was enough, you know, enough of a springboard for us to launch this podcast, certainly.
But what I'm saying is you don't build that mass audience and people don't necessarily tune into like what you do and who you are, especially if you're in a magazine like Edge where you don't, for years they didn't have bylines, so people wouldn't even know who wrote what and therefore what is significant. People know Kieran Gillum wrote that from Deus Ex if they talk about it still.
I'm glad no-one knows that I wrote The Skyward Soldiery.
But what I'm saying is you're just never given the platform to build that audience and you need that audience to launch an independent media venture and like should be able to be supported by an audience. But there's so many complicated mechanics to it because over the years like if you are told by your publisher you have to drive traffic no matter what. You have to talk about these games.
You have to get this traffic from guides traffic. You have to sell SSDs through e-coms, click links and things like that. And that builds a certain sense of your audience seeing you as well.
You're just doing like this kind of like money making website stuff and they become wary of you as opposed to drilling down and being like all we're writing on this website is passionate articles about the things we like. Well, guess what? This framework for doing that never existed in websites.
You could never ever do it. It's always been about ad revenue and SEO. And so now is really the time that existentially websites need to be able to do this stuff.
But it's so hard to ask the audience to understand why it's important and why they should have enough value in the thing they're reading to support it. So I think writers and editors have been put in a very tough position. You know, being funded by your audience is the future of this stuff.
But to ask the audience to do it is really, really hard for a variety of reasons. So that's what I think about independent media more generally. And I think that the future of magazines are in a similar spot.
Like the kind of more prestige magazines that have launched like a profound waste of time. I mean, fair play to Cass. You know, very youthful looking dude does not look like he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders in the way that fucking we do from working in print.
And so he has made four really nice things that people like and have funded very successfully. Well done, you know, genuinely. But like also, I don't know, that seems like a better way of doing it than like the way we've done it.
Like to find an audience and to have that audience like fund the thing. I'm not saying that makes it easy, but it's a great thing to be able to achieve and it's what the future of this thing is. If you can find that audience, they'll pay for it.
That's where this is going. Go on Matthew.
I was just going to say he's Dorian Gray and we're his portrait in the ass. Very much. What I'm hearing from this Sam is that I need to change my personal brand from Professor Leighton to Leighton Orient.
So that's what I'm going to do.
Fuck's sake. Is that the second time that joke's been made this year on this podcast?
I clocked it about four minutes ago. I've just been trying to find an in to say it.
So that's a very rambly, but I think it's...
No, I thought that was... I think there was a lot of good observation in there. And you are right.
I do think it's quite a UK thing. I know we always sound a bit better when we talk about, not the easier ride, but certainly the more exciting ride some of our American colleagues and peers have had. But there's a sense of, when a load of Kotaku and whatever else writers get together to do that after shock or is it after shock?
Aftermath.
Aftermath. People follow them and pay attention. Where I think if you announce, there's almost like if you announce stuff in the UK, everyone's like fucking get over yourself.
There is an element of that. It's like, oh yeah, oh well, see ya.
Well, that's it. I mean, the fact is as well, I'm realistic as well. I think most people have the one thing that they pay for, that's important to them.
So this year, I think like my one, other than I back to Patreons, I support Simon Parkins' podcast and yes, there's one other podcast, Simon's podcast, and John Denton as well, who was one of the first people to back us on Patreon. So returning the favor, it's a nice thing to do. Other than that, Vulture is the one thing I've paid for this year, other than buying Edge on a monthly ad hoc basis, which is my full honesty, that's my relationship with Edge.
That's the one thing I support and imagine most people are the same. So people don't even have the money necessarily to support a fleet of things. But yeah, they're just everyone starting from such a small base of people, of support, that it's like genuinely challenging to launch a new thing, because you just don't get to build up the currency for it.
And I bet Aftermath is really hard to run. I bet it is. I've got no doubt about it, that it's not easy to make anything like that work.
But they're completely transparent about how their finances work, like what money they need to make for everyone to make a good living, when they get to hire more staff and that kind of stuff. I think they literally document what the money is they need and what money they've got coming in. So it's a step in the right direction, but it's challenging certainly.
So is there anything you think future should be doing with the existing mags to support them, Matthew? Because those are like still our... I still love those magazines.
I think they're worth treasuring. And it's a hard year. Total Film closed as well as Play.
Play was great for what, two full-time staff? I think they had maybe three on the writing side. Yeah, I was curious what you made of this.
I would honestly... The thing I... It doesn't help the mags as they currently are, but I do think they have the talent and the infrastructure to be thinking about the Artisan magazine, the journal space, in a...
In a... Or just thinking about it full stop, really. You know, future's always done.
Bookazines. But I think they treated bookazines, at least when I was there, they were a little bit of a kind of like, well, we've got all this content, let's just shove it all together. It's a bit of a cash grab.
Very few of them were written as original bookazines, so it was a bit of a joke, I would say, in terms of how those things were perceived. But, I don't know, I just think they have, like... You know, the challenge of getting a new journal, or a new whatever fanzine off the ground, you know, the hardest bit is getting the actual printing infrastructure in place, and those relationships, and knowing how all that works.
You know, I'm sure Kaz can speak to some of this when we talk to him about, you know, how they actually make that thing, and the costs involved with that. And, you know, they're in a good space to actually, you know, at least take a punt on them. Like, why they don't have a kind of an...
Trying to do, like, an edge present, which they've done before, those sort of gatherings of things, but more to the high concept sort of production standards of, like, a profound waste of time. That's probably what I would do.
Yeah, like, the Outer Wilds thing that lost in Cult Launch, which has been phenomenally successful.
But that's the thing, in terms of the actual staff you need to make those things, they have all those people, they have all of those disciplines, and probably some of the best people. I mean, all these fucking companies that are sprouting up to make these other things, most of them are ex-future or imagine or ex-print people who just got forced out of it, made redundant and went, oh right, I'll just go and have an easier life doing this thing instead, you know. It seems so dumb to me that someone hasn't tried, you know, that print is treated just as this sort of slightly kind of like dying animal that you kind of tolerate, when actually there's big money to be made from it.
Money for a product, money you can be proud of. That's what bugs me, it's like, you know, we used to make stuff. We used to make things in this country.
But that's the thing, they still make good things.
And they do, yeah, and that's why I don't want to dunk on it too hard, you know, too hard, but like, I just feel like they're missing a treat there.
Yeah.
You know, but like the On, you know, the new On magazine journal, you know, that's all ex-Edge people, there's no reason that couldn't have happened in that future, you know?
Yeah.
And probably cheaper for them to have done it, because they have all those existing relationships with the print companies and...
Yeah, it's funny, because on that recent Metal Gear Patreon episode we did, we talked about that thing Dan Dawkins made, which was like a step in that direction, right? I forgot they even did like a hardcover version of it, but it was still very bookazine-y, and since then this world of like slipcase-y, very fancy high-end things, like little papercraft editions and stuff, it's like, it has exploded, it just feels like edge retro gamer have the cache to do that stuff. There's no reason read-only memory has more cache than retro gamer to make that stuff.
It's a much longer-standing brand, but these are the people who actually went and did it, and future didn't.
That's the difference. There is also, maybe, there is the site element that maybe people are willing to spend that kind of money and take a punt on independent creators because they are independent, and they want to put their money... I'm not saying future should be kickstarting big magazines or anything.
That probably wouldn't work and look great. But, yeah, I just... I don't know, all these things are just made by people who I know.
You look at Jason Killingsworth and his tune in Fairweather. I mean, they're slightly different. They're more kind of very high-budget books, and rather than, like, they're not magazines or journals.
They're a level above that. But, you know, I think his Dark Souls thing or the Bloodborne one, that made, like, a million on Kickstarter. You know?
Yeah.
Like, that's, I mean, and it goes back into it. I think those things are, like, fucking expensive to make, because they're, like, you know, they're, like, the covers are, like, carved out of wood by hand, or Italy, and things like that.
By blind monks, yeah.
Yes. So, you know, and I get that. But, you know, you've got to, there's got to be something in it.
Well, that's it. I think it's because, like, there's never anyone who's put in a position to think about this stuff. Like, it's, you know, every publisher I've ever worked with at Future was, like, looking at a big spreadsheet of magazine sales and being, like, what can we do about this?
What is coming up? And that's fine. That's their jobs.
But, yeah, it feels like, I don't know, it feels like they're closing games magazines while there's never been more independent, high-end print things going on. And it's crazy that they just were not able to make that happen themselves. Like, because probably you just couldn't.
We're going to invest in this super high-end Dark Souls book series, right? And we're not going to make money on it until next year. Like, that's just not how media companies work.
They are so short-term thinking. And I think that's why they haven't made those things. And, you know, I massively respect people have gone off and done it.
Because, you know what? I lack the courage to do that sort of thing. I really do.
A podcast, that is as far as I can reach. And that's OK, because I like making this podcast.
Sometimes too lazy to do it.
OK, Matthew, that's a good meaty chat about this. I think we eventually hit upon something quite juicy there. I think we kind of stumbled into it after complaining about the past quite a lot.
And so that's good. We've talked about Launch Gazine before. Something that seems ill-advised.
Should we do that? What would that look like, Matthew, if we launched a print thing, Back Page branded?
I think it should be £500 and the cover is like lasered into glass in Portugal.
Shatters as soon as you open it.
Yes. You can open it one time only and then it shatters. Yeah.
I mean, it's a lot of work. I mean, I must admit, I feel like there was like an era of zines. Maybe like five years ago, there seemed to be a lot of like, you know, Nintendo Force and pure Nintendo and things like that.
And I don't know if the focus has shifted slightly more to these. Well, I'll have one a year, but it'd be really fucking nice. Like if we were to do anything, I'm probably more interested in that.
You know, like, you know, something more along the lines of a profound waste of time, you know, something you want to keep. Like that, that was the big thing. I met with Andrew Hines, who's making on the and, you know, it was just the emphasis on, like, it not being disposable and it being kind of like timeless.
Like even with zines, like magazines just feel like they've got that, that kind of cadence of coming out more often. And with that comes the expectation that they're going to be a bit more disposable. Like this one thing a year, it feels like you're going to buy it, you're going to own it, you're going to keep it.
And I don't know, if I'm going to really put time into something, I kind of want it to be kept. I've thrown away so many of my own fucking magazines over the years because we haven't got the shelf space. And I don't know, I'm sick of my work being in the bin.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It reaches a certain level where it's just too fancy to throw out, really. Yeah, and I'm the same.
I'm sort of like, I'm nearing the point where I want to buy a house and do you know what I want to do? I want to store print media in it. That's what I want to do.
I want to just have print media. I want to have like fucking stacks of Spider-Man comics and then like all the games magazines and games books they keep are just as fancy as all the like Marvel and DC and Image hardcovers and stands kind of like next to them. I think that is a good way to angle it.
In some ways though I wonder if like the millennials' lack of property ownership is maybe an obstacle to this because you're probably going to struggle to get Gen Z to buy print products anyway. That's a broad generalization.
They're being bought by the people who read magazines when they were teenagers. They're being bought by like 30s and 40 year olds.
Yeah, you're on the runny there?
Yeah, sorry.
That's fine. It was just really obvious. We're definitely keeping that in the pod.
Yeah, I mean, but I agree though. Something super high end, something you can be proud of. I think it's true if we ever do make anything and we're not rushing into anything, do anything like that, but we've pondered it a little bit.
Like, could we get like little sketch illustrations and stuff like that? What would the best possible version of that be that it's not just like, it feels like you've bought an issue of, you know, a Nintendo or PlayStation magazine circa 2008? Like, what is the differentiating factor that makes you keep it around?
What's like something that won't be in a charity shop in like 12 months? I asked this because I recently went into Oxfam in Bath and I went to the sci-fi book section, the entertainment book section, right? And do you know what it had there?
It had the most dated thing you can possibly imagine. Joss Whedon, the geek king of the universe! That was the book that was on there.
It was so a relic of another time. And the idea of a back page annual being next to that is just too depressing to me.
I don't know about an annual, I think a one time. I know we definitely threw around one time years ago the idea of putting together, formalising what the back page canon is in some kind of thing.
Yeah, I think I've just taken voluntary redundancy from Frontier and had too much time on my hands and I think I pitched it to you.
But I do kind of like the idea of something which has… If you present it in like, this is it, you keep it, because it's got to have the vibe of the Bible. You can't throw this away because this is like a holy text of a back page.
This has got a ribbon for a bookmark, that kind of thing.
Yeah, it's got a ribbon.
I can't throw this away.
It's got a seal to open it when you open it for the first time. Yeah. Maybe it's got a bit of hair from one of the saints in there, the saints being the most popular guests.
You can have a bit of Jeremy Peel's hair or Rich Stanton's hair.
Just some sort of patron saint.
We just have all these famous developers, but it's actually just you and me. Just shaving ourselves head and we were asleep for proper.
Everything is like a Bible verse in a sense. We're like, oh yeah, just turn to like Mikami 13 and then you're going to get the sort of like copy you're after, or like Kojima 12 or whatever, or like Levine 5. Yeah, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
They are hard work.
I can't think of at least 10 sickos on Discord who buy that.
They definitely would. The problem is though, I actually already feel like this prestige print space has pretty much got all the competitors it needs. The key to launching any of these things is seeing an opportunity in the market, a gap in the market and going, well, what is our niche?
The truth is that a UK podcast by X Magazine People is our niche, Matthew. We found it. This is it.
We're doing it right now. I tend not to overextend myself in case I fail and have to pretend it never happened later on. That's just like my Batman podcast, Ashley Day, that I've not talked about before.
What? Maybe it came up once. It was a very brief venture.
But nonetheless, I think that pretty much covers everything I want to talk about in this part, Matthew. Since we've ended on the Prestige magazine chat. Well, actually we ended on fucking Jeremy Peel's hair being stuffed into like copies of a book.
Very cursed. Seems like a perfect point to transition to our conversation with Cass. So yeah, Cass is very much an innovator in this print Prestige Games Magazine space.
So we'll hand over to that conversation now.
Welcome back to the podcast. So, this is part two of our episode, The Death and Life of Games Magazines. Very dramatic title, but the content's quite fun, hopefully.
I'm rejoined again by Matthew Castle. How's it going, Matthew?
Hello, yep, still here.
Yeah, still kicking. And we are joined by a special guest, Caspian Whistler, who is the creative director and editor-in-chief of A Profound Waste of Time. A very, I can't remember how to describe it, Casp, like a bold video games magazine, but a very nice project you've been working for a few years now.
So how are you doing? You okay?
Yeah, thank you guys so much for having me. I'm like, you know, I've been a long time listener of the pod and I always sort of, I think I've said this to Matthew before that, you know, I never worked in traditional sort of games media. So it's really, I've always used this, I've kind of vicariously lived through you guys and the stuff in this pod over the years.
So it's nice to be on. Thanks for having me.
I mean, well done for sparing yourself the psychic damage, first of all, for not working in traditional media. That's just wise. No, it's great to have you on, Cass, because you make something really, really cool with a bunch of great writers in each issue.
And you obviously, this is a Kickstarter funded project. And it's kind of the, I sort of certainly wasn't the first of its kind that I heard about, this sort of premium prestige high-end great paper stock magazine with a real kind of like authorial intent behind it. It's a really cool project and it's great to have you on to talk about it.
So can you tell us a bit about you? Most of the people in games media we know your background is in design and quite different. You're a bit younger than us.
So tell us where you came from.
I guess like Apwot as a project, a magazine, Apwot is a really weird initialism, but it's the only one I've got. So it is Apwot or a profound waste of time. It was a zine that I did as an art student at uni.
So I was studying graphic design and communication. We started learning about zines, and how they burst into popularity with the advent of cheap photocopying, cheap printing, and the punk movement. People taking, rebelling, building up a subculture through sharing cheap printed material with each other.
So we were learning about this kind of rebellious spirit. And I was trying to think about what would be a good sort of zine for me to make. And I always felt that I was interested in games.
But the idea of sort of doing a kind of a kind of punky, kind of aggressive zine about games kind of felt redundant. Like this was back in, God, this is this was 10 years ago now, which is crazy to think about. But it just kind of, you know, we were at the height of I mean, you guys know 2014 wasn't the best time, I think, for a lot of people in the games industry.
And I think, you know, it just kind of felt like we were at the peak of sort of like angry gamer discourse. So I was trying to think, how can I make a zine about games that is like rebellious? And I kind of realized that the rebellious way to do that is to kind of go in the complete opposite direction and try to make something that's like super design focused and super kind of like as welcoming as possible and kind of that prioritized a lot of the sort of values that I had, that I didn't really see being sort of prioritized in sort of the games media that I kind of grew up with or seeing online, that sort of thing.
What did you see as those values, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, I think, so like I grew up reading O&M or NOM, I can't remember when it rebranded or what, maybe Matthew can speak to that. Was it O&M first and then became NOM? I can't remember.
No, it was NOM first and became O&M in 2005 or 2006. Right.
OK, cool. So yeah, so like I was there before the rebrand, reading very, very young. And I think a lot of that was just sort of I'd see sort of something colorful on the cover.
And I would like to, you know, it was like this really wonderful like window into sort of games and stuff that would interest me. It was also like kind of like imagination fuel because didn't really have a lot of good access to the internet when I was a kid. So it was very like you'd look at screenshots and you'd read the stuff as best as you could.
And you kind of imagine what these games were like to play. But, you know, games magazines had been dying out massively around the time. I think I mean, can you guys correlate with me on that?
I don't know. Like did Future have a bunch of closures around 2014 or am I misremembering? I feel like it was around that time.
Yeah, you definitely are in the closure years by then. Yeah. You know, we're talking about like the probably the end of Nintendo Gamer around then and PSW had shut a little bit before then as well.
So I would say that's the beginning of the beginning of the end.
Yeah, so like I was kind of looking at that backdrop and I was also, you know, I would look at like the games magazines that were still around. And I think it's kind of emblematic of like where the games industry itself was at kind of during, you know, especially when I was a teen, during like the Xbox 360 kind of PS3 era. You know, we were in the kind of, I don't know how you guys describe it, like the brown era, the kind of bloom era, the hyper realistic kind of...
Yeah, the beige era.
Yeah.
Ground shooters and...
Yeah. You'd look at sort of like video game magazine covers and they were always like a bombardment of text and kind of... Because, you know, the model was like they're competing on a shelf for people to pick them up, right?
So they are like trying to cram as much stuff as possible on the front cover because the cover isn't just like the traditional cover of like a book that you would have in a bookstore. The cover is in itself an advert for you to try and buy the publication inside underneath it rather. So and I remember just looking at like a lot of this stuff and so many of the images that you see on sort of gaming mags was just not representative.
Well, that's not fair because it was representative of like what was selling and what was the predominant sort of genre at the time. But like, you know, the games that I was playing, the games that I love, the stuff that I grew up on, the stuff that interested me and made me think that games were sort of worth investing in weren't usually the games that had like white blokes with guns on them. Do you know what I mean?
Like it was different stuff. And also, you know, I was on a design course, right? So I was like learning about like the really high grade periodicals that are out there for stuff like film and I don't know, poetry, like whatever area of the arts and culture sector you could think of.
There was like an amazing magazine out there that was like beautifully made and prioritized a bunch of the stuff that like, you know, I was being taught to sort of view as important being an art student. I was just like really baffled by why there wasn't anything like that for games. I was also really frustrated that like games, I was on a design course, right?
But even there, games were sort of looked down on. I don't think that's the case now. I think we've definitely sort of over the last like 10 years, definitely like burst through that kind of barrier.
And I think people take games very seriously now. It's like a kind of a medium of artistic expression. It's like a creative industry.
But it was, yeah, I just, I was baffled by like the absence of that. So that's kind of where Apwot came from. As like a, I was trying to fill a void, I think.
So what were the games that meant a lot to you? Like what was the, you know, it sounds like you were hung up on the fact that, you know, the way AAA games are being packaged and sold was just all like, at least the visual presentation was not particularly imaginative. So what were the games that kind of like fired off your imagination?
What are the, your key texts coming into this?
Maybe Matthew can relate to this, I don't know. But I think I had like, I guess, I don't know, what's the word, the burden, I suppose, of being a Nintendo kid in the UK, which meant that like, I only had one console. So like during the Xbox 360 PS3 era, I had a Wii, which meant that you're immediately in a completely different sort of, your diet is just completely different.
You know, if you want to play stuff, you are just, I mean, that was a time when like Nintendo's offering was like completely out of step with the competition. And there was very little sort of, I mean, there were ports of stuff, don't get me wrong, but it was just, you were just in a completely different, you were in a completely different food chain. I think that's fair to say, right?
So yeah, absolutely.
Yeah. So I grew up with stuff like, you know, I was playing like, you know, I grew up on like sort of like Nintendo mainstays, but I was also, you know, really interested in stuff like Okami, Katamari, you know, weird stuff like that. I guess I suppose like not Western made stuff, I think would probably be a fairer way to put it.
Like I was kind of, I just naturally gravitated more towards sort of more imaginative, weird things that kind of had interesting art styles or had something interesting going on mechanically. But yeah, it's hard to think of like, it's so funny. You'd have thought that like, it would be really easy to list off like key texts, you know, like one of the key games, but it's hard.
Maybe one way of asking it is like, do you think, you know, a profound waste of time, the issues you've already put out, like I kind of assume that that's your gaming taste.
Yeah, I would say, I would say that's very true. Yeah. As much as I mean, so like at the top of the show, right, you described me as like editor in chief.
And I guess that's kind of true, but not really anymore because I've got Simon Parkin involved in the content now. So Simon's been helping as editor at large for since he came in midway through issue three. So we've done issue four and now we're doing, so we did most of issue three, issue four and issue five together.
So it's a bit of Simon's tastes bleeding in there as well, but also like whatever the writers are interested in. But as a general litmus test, yeah, it is basically more or less like my interests are kind of like, I mean, that's what the original zine was. The zine was like a thing that I illustrated and wrote on my own.
And just to show what my tastes were, like, I really wanted to talk about Boktai. I don't know. Do you guys remember Boktai?
It was like this old...
Of course. Yeah, we love it. Bullshit Kazuma vanity project over here.
That's very much our area.
Or like, I mean, if you want to talk about key text, like Boktai just blew my mind as like a 10 year old or whenever it was when I played it, because suddenly you're playing a video game that is like making you think about the time of year and sort of the space in which you're playing it. So I was like, you know, stuff like that. So I've always kind of been interested in like weird, interesting things.
And yeah, it's no surprise that the first scene had a huge like Boktai section because I just needed to get that off my chest. Do you know what I mean? So yeah.
News previews, features, Boktai and reviews.
This whole thing is a stealth Boktai project. Like that's why I'm here really. Yeah, yeah.
So we talked a little bit about the early background of A Profound Waste of Time there, like the idea of something quite punk and then changing your mind to make it something quite sincerely celebratory, I guess.
Yeah.
But how did you get it off the ground, that first issue?
Well, it was a battle of like, it was in increments, right? So I did the first zine, and then I posted it on the Destructoid. Destructoid used to have, I don't know if they still do, these like community forums that you could like post your blog to, and like maybe people would see it.
I don't know. You could just make posts. I was like, I made a post for the first zine that I did, and I was like, I need feedback.
And they front-paged it, and it got like loads and loads of comments and people saying that they wanted to buy it. And I was like, oh, okay. But like that was never like, you know, the plan.
And I had no aspirations to get into sort of like games media or whatever. But so I just kind of left it for a year. And then I did another one a year later with this was like slightly bigger.
It was going from like, I don't know, I think the first one was like 15 pages. And then it became this new one. This later iteration was like 30.
But that was the first time when I was like writing with people. So a lot of people in the community in Destructoid's community blogs submitted work. Jonathan Holmes also, who's like a, yeah, he was a big champion of it.
And like he wrote, people were just submitting stuff. And then I got to experience like, you know, what it was like laying out other people's work and sort of thinking about what the right visual treatment for all this different stuff is. And then, you know, when you graduate with a lot, like graduating with an arts degree is very scary at the best of times.
So I graduated and I was just like, what the fuck do I do? Oh, sorry. Wait, guys, can I swear?
Is that like a laugh? I'm really sorry to your audience. But yeah, I basically, yeah, I just didn't know what I was doing.
And I was really scared. I just sort of thought, okay, well, this is the one thing that I feel quite passionate about right now. And I thought I'd give it a sort of go by doing Kickstarter.
Do either of you guys know a person called Mr. Bingo? Do you guys know? Have you guys heard of this guy at all?
I don't think so. Okay.
So Mr. Bingo is like, he's a very prominent sort of UK illustrator and artist.
Right.
And he'd recently done a Kickstarter called Hate Mail. He'd kind of built a strand of his work that became really popular in which people would pay him to send them rudely illustrated sort of postcards insulting them. So it was called Hate Mail.
So it would say, you know, Dear Tony, you're a fat git. Love Mr. Bingo. It would be beautifully illustrated and stuff.
And like, I thought, okay, if I email this guy, because he had a successful Kickstarter, which was like an anthology of like all the printed material that he'd done for Hate Mail. So it was like this beautiful book for Hate Mail. And I thought, I'm a young graduate.
Maybe if I email him and I swear in the, if I drop a swear word in the email, like he might respond. And I did. I said, I've got no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
Please help me. And he very kindly took me out for pizza, believe it or not, which was like an amazing stroke of luck. And he introduced me to Darren Wall.
So it turns out like his best mate is Darren Wall, who Darren runs. Well, now he works at Thames & Hudson, but he founded and ran Read Only Memory, which they make beautiful video game books. Yeah.
So he worked on the Sega Mega Drive, collected works and a bunch of other like incredible stuff. I really recommend everyone look up Read Only Memory if you can, if you if you're interested. So, yeah, just through complete I had no idea about that connection, but it just turned out Darren was the best person in the world to meet.
So Darren helped me organize my first Kickstarter, really. So it's like a lot of like incremental work, but also just like a bit of really good fortune and luck that those two things kind of lined up in the way that they did. Because I think it would have been really hard for me to have done what I did on my own.
And yeah, well, very nicely done to grow it from a community project into something that's viable that finds an audience. It's no small thing, especially when you don't have a career or a background in in-games media. So yeah, well done.
Thanks. I mean, I was very lucky in that I had really good people vouching for me, like Jonathan Holmes was vouching for me, Darren vouched for me. You know, so many people were sort of, and also I think I was lucky in that the zine itself was very kind of, I had really good photos of like the stuff that I'd made already, which became, that became a really easy calling card to be like, look at this thing I made, would you like to be a part of it?
And somehow through that, through a combination of all those factors, I got Toby Fox involved and Ashley Birch and, you know, a bunch of, and you know, Yacht Club, which is just, it's just crazy. I don't know if it would happen now. I think maybe it was the right idea at the right time, but enough people wanted to see that it kind of, it just kind of happened.
So yeah, just very lucky, really.
Yeah. It's also something I saw other games journalists championing. I think people were like, oh wow, someone's made an actual high quality zine.
And then I think you could see in the, even like getting to like issue two from issue one, just how much, how many doors it seemed like the issue one had unlocked for you. It just seemed like you were just, you were finding more and more big names to contribute, which was just really impressive. So yeah.
Yeah. It's been tough though. Like it's been really, really like, I mean, like between like issue one, like nearly just wiped me out.
I think it's like really important to cover that as well, because it's not all been rosy. Like a lot of contributors and stuff for the first issue kind of either ghosted or just sort of disappeared or couldn't be part of it anymore. And then, you know, when you are kickstarting something and people have given you money on the promise of all this stuff that you've said is going to be in it, it kind of puts you in a bit of a bind, you know?
So I really, and also you've got to remember, I'm a fresh, this is the very first thing I've done outside of like, I've just graduated at this point. So it kind of became clear to me that I had to keep delaying the thing. And then when I finally was able to sort of get things moving and get things in good shape, I kind of realized that it had to be as good as possible.
Otherwise, I'm probably never going to be able to work again. Like it'll be like a black mark on my entire career. So I thought, okay, so we got quite overfunded for that first issue.
So I ended up just pouring. The more it got delayed, the more things went wrong. The more I was like, I need to make this as exceptional as possible.
So the actual pitch for the first mag was much smaller page dimensions. And also only 50 pages. And then the final mag ended up becoming like much larger than that.
And also like 200 pages, basically, which is just mad. But it was just, yeah, ungodly project bloat, really. But it was, you know, and it's funny, I was so idealistic as well, because I was just this like fresh graduate who didn't know what he was doing.
I was like, I'm going to use the best paper and I'm going to do work with the best people and have the best illustrators and it's going to be, you know, it was very blue sky thinking. The problem is once you've made one of those, you now have to make all the others to the same standard, which is, which I've managed to do, which is great. But definitely, you know, if I was coming into this as a businessman with like a more coherent strategy, I definitely would have sort of done things differently.
But then at the same time, like I probably wouldn't be interested in doing that. It's kind of, it is kind of my dream project that I kind of get to have my cake and eat it in this way. Yeah.
You also have the quintessential print magazine experience of being burnt out and also people letting you down. That's like a lot of what print media is. So I think it's, it's good to experience it in miniature like that.
So that's good.
Yeah.
If I could ask a bit more about your inspirations, did you read a lot of print media growing up? Because I think that there must be at least one period of edge you read. I'm just assuming that based on like the type of content that you have in there and the way that features are angled.
Maybe not, but I mean, what were your sort of like points of inspiration for a profound waste of time?
So it's really interesting. Like I wasn't actually, I wasn't actually that big of an edge reader. I did pop in and out of it, I would say.
But I mean, it's really weird. Like the content and like I think Apwot has become more, as it's solidified, it's become, I mean, it's essentially new video games journalism, right? I think that's the term that people use.
At the time, I was kind of very determined to make something that felt like a bit of an emotional outlet to sort of reframe sort of games as this kind of, I mean, you know, that's why it's called a profound waste of time, right, is because that's what people say about the profession or not the profession, about the industry in general. And I kind of wanted to subvert that in a nice way. But in terms of, so, you know, the content was very much like, the subtitle now for the mag is inspired by video games.
So it's like the idea is like, it's about content that is inspired by games or that games can be inspirational. Before it was very kind of the subtitle for the zine was thoughts and feelings about video games, which was a bit wishy-washy. And there's a reason why I changed it.
But I also think that the intent is kind of in there, which was like, I wanted to sort of look, let's talk about have a little space where I talk about games sensitively and I give them sensitive treatment. And I think that just happens to align with what I think a lot of Edges content does. But yeah, I never, I was going to go also like, I wasn't sure whether or not I was going to go do English or art when I graduated from like secondary school.
So it was kind of like, so I don't know, like it was, there definitely wasn't, I think, if a port has turned out good, I feel like it's accidental in some ways, you know, I feel like it's kind of coalesced in the right way that I was working with the right people and that my general gut feeling about what I wanted the content to be was right. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I can believe that. I think that makes sense.
I mean, this podcast is very much a little bit of that. There wasn't a games podcast we kind of copied, but you have your own sensibilities, right, from the things you've played and the things you've absorbed. And you're not necessarily drawing inspiration from one source.
It's just kind of like this weird cloud of stuff in your head that you're putting on the page. I think that kind of makes sense.
I think so. Yeah, it's not like a, you know, it's like, Toby Fox once said to me that everything goes into your brain like a kind of cocktail mixer and then you just make the drink, you know, you just pour the drink. So it's like whatever you've absorbed just kind of becomes part of like what you make.
And I kind of think that's applied with Apwot too. Like, I think it's just kind of a manifestation of what my interests always were. But I think, you know, editorially, like at the beginning, I was really keen to get game devs to write stuff.
I wanted to hear directly from them. But then you sort of realize that there's a reason that, you know, game devs are game devs and writers are writers, is because they have things that they like to do, and you shouldn't try and force them too much to be... You shouldn't try and force people to make, jump into professions that, you know, it's not really truly their calling.
But I think like that was very much like, I always knew Apwot, I wanted to hear directly from people about framing this as like a creative pursuit. Like, games is like a creative calling, and not just like an entertainment industry. Because, you know, we've talked about this before, you hear it all the time on the BBC, or anytime, but like, games are mentioned in news.
It's always framed at the beginning with like, games are the biggest game, like industry, creative industry on the planet. And it's like, as that's like a preface for like, why you should give a shit, that's like, that's why you should care about them. So I was kind of, you know, we'd reached that point back in 2014, 2015, but I kind of, I was very much coming from the idea that like, I want people to realize that there's like an emotional, this is like a creative pursuit for people that people spend their whole lives on, and just trying to frame game devs in the same way that you do sort of artists or filmmakers, you know?
But I don't know if like, that's unique to Apwot. I'm sure that like, there's loads of games press that do that. So, you know.
Yeah. Okay. Well, you know, it tells us a little bit more about how you, how you angled it.
You're operating in a different space to traditional games mags. You're not competing for eyeballs on a shop shelf. But do you still think about your content with one eye on the audience?
Getting big, familiar games on the cover, landing, big name interviews, etc.
Yeah, I think I'm always trying to make sure that the covers are access based, right? I don't ever want to put something on the cover that's not like an exclusive get that we've managed to swing somehow. So, yeah, I really, I really don't feel like...
It's necessarily about being current, though. You know, it's, it's, you know, it's very, I'm trying to create... With each issue, I'm trying to make something that's timeless.
And by timeless, I mean, I want this stuff to still be interesting and people to pick it up and read it in 10 years time. In order to do that, it's not necessarily about picking the hottest new game. It's just like, what is a game that has enough weight to it that it feels worthy of being in a pot cover?
That sounds really like narcissistic and bad to say, but like, because who cares ultimately, right? It's just my small little mag. But I do have to go in with that kind of mindset.
And I think, you know, I'm always thinking about Sakurai, Masahiro Sakurai. And like, you know, I think about when you see a character represented in Smash Brothers, you're not just excited because, oh, your character is in Smash Brothers that you've been campaigning for. Like, it's also because you're seeing this character or this property that you love, like, represented in a way that's really exciting and, like, given the most care possible, you know?
Like, that's why people are so hyped when you see a character in Smash, because it's like, you know, it's basically like enshrining that character in, like, a hall of fame.
Oh, yeah. I mean, I know that's how Matthew felt when they added Sora from Kingdom Hearts.
What on earth? Come on. Get Banjo-Kazooie out of fucking Smash Bros.
But, I mean, that's the thing, right? That's the best Banjo's ever looked, is in Smash Bros., I would say.
Yeah, that's true.
You know what I mean?
Everyone deserves it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, and again, like, I'm not saying that an Apwot cover is, like, at all of the same grandiose, like, achievement as having a character in Smash Bros. But I try and think about, like, would people be excited about this game being in Smash Bros.?
Is this a kind of thing that people would feel passionate about? Because we kind of live and die by your cover, right? Like, even on Kickstarter, even though we're not competing on a shelf, it's kind of like, I want to showcase that we can get access to really big games and really big devs and, you know, that, like, we're doing something with those games that, like, you've never seen them represented in this way before.
So I'm quite interested in light of that, like, because obviously your your next issue, correct me if I'm wrong, is Unicorn Overlord.
It is indeed. Yeah, it is.
Which is obviously, like, the newest game that you've put on your cover. And the one which is maybe arguably still finding its place in the culture. And you know, it's not quite the same as, like, you know, The Last Guardian or Katamari or Portal.
So like, what was the sort of thinking there? Like, you know, is it just, I like this game or you're just really sure of it? Or is it, like you say, a question of the access?
Yeah, I mean, the honest answer is it's all of that stuff, right? Like, it's all of those things. You know, because we're so access driven, like it's really important to have stuff that we can deliver something unique and interesting with, right?
When the opportunity came up with that this might be a possibility, firstly, like, I really, really like Unicorn Overlord. Like, I think it's rad. I'm a big fan of sort of, I mean, Vanillaware, I would say of, like, all the game studios working today, they probably have the highest standard for 2D art.
I think that's a fair thing to say, unless there's, like, someone else that I'm, like, thinking I'm forgetting.
But they're up there for sure.
Yeah, right? Like, I think, yeah, like, please forgive me, commenters or listeners, if there's someone that you're screaming at. But I think, yeah, I think Vanillaware are, like, really up there.
And it was just, like, an amazing opportunity. They're also, like, very, like, they don't, you know, usually do Western press. So it was just kind of, like, it was just kind of, it just felt like, even if Unicorn Overlord isn't necessarily as big as, say, Portal 2, I'm pretty confident that it's basically a modern classic.
So I don't have any reservations about keeping it on there. And I'm just really proud of that cover as well. I think the cover has come out super, super cool.
Rika Diaz did that kind of, oh, I guess I shouldn't, there's no point me describing a cover on a podcast, is there, really? I'll just forget it.
We did a whole episode of that, two episodes in fact.
I remember that one, I listened to that one.
We'll link the Kickstarter page in the show notes anyway.
Okay, that would be kind to you. Thank you, thank you.
Yeah, of course. Was that an example of, because I saw a Sega PR posting about it on LinkedIn, which is what PRs do about covers on LinkedIn. Did they approach you about it or did you approach them and it was like they went and got you the access?
Because I know the Sega Europe people are pretty good for sorting that stuff out over here in a way that not all Japanese publishers are super accessible from the UK.
Yeah, so that was a case of... So you'll be unsurprised to know that the seed for this was planted years ago. You kind of ask and then you sort of get, you hear like, oh, maybe that won't be possible.
And then eventually, without realizing it, it's kind of grown and blossomed. You can harvest access basically. So yeah, Sega Europe were really instrumental in sort of getting us in there.
And super, super excited to have Margaret doing that piece and had she conducted that interview so well.
That's Margaret Robertson, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's just excellent. So, you know, it was a case though of, especially with Japanese devs, it's usually a no until they see the magazine, you know, until they actually see it.
I find with all the access that we've gotten, it's kind of always been a case of just using the magazine itself as a calling card. Because I think when people see it, they understand that it's quite, you know, not to sound conceited or whatever, but it is kind of a special thing. It is kind of a special project.
I think, you know, the fact that, like, VanillaWare of all studios sort of looked at the art in Apwot, and they were like, yeah, let's do this, is like the biggest compliment I could have ever asked for. You know what I mean? So, yeah, so yeah, just kind of.
But, you know, the golden rule of all of this stuff is just asking politely and being patient, and eventually stuff comes if you're lucky. So that's the main thing. Yeah.
That's cool. So this is the, I guess, a bit of a golden question, but like, did you ever have a desire to work in trad print media? Or did it sound too depressing?
That is a loaded question, isn't it? But I am curious to just hear what, because it sounds like you had this decision you made between, you know, writing and design, and you went the design route, but you have ended up doing both at the same time, kind of. So, yeah, yeah.
Well, I mean, I'll be honest, like I said, I listen to the pods, so definitely no. Like, definitely I don't want to get into print media. I mean, like, that's not, I mean, that's just because I think a part of the Apwot model is like, how can I make this sustainable?
And it's just not sustainable for me to, if I was to really be in this industry, to be making sort of, to be churning these things out, I just don't think would be viable for me. But I think, I think if the question is like, oh, being in like broader print media, you know, maybe I never really had the proper opportunity to try, you know, like I graduated, I had this Kickstarter and I've been doing that. And that kind of has been my print media thing.
And like, it hasn't really been my full time job for most of these years. Like, I've been doing sort of freelance graphic design and stuff for like film and TV, like animation studios and stuff. So, you know, it's just I've never really, I've just never really had like the chance.
I wouldn't say never or not, but it does kind of seem that like from the stories you guys tell and the kind of, you know, I follow, I follow Chris, Chris Schilling. And he's always posting that, that gif. What's the gif?
Oh, I'm forgetting.
Daniel J. Lewis kind of puffing and blowing.
And I feel that already, you know, as like, as someone who just sort of like is only doing sort of one of these mags a year. So I just, I don't know.
So yeah, it's a lovely thing for sure. Yes.
Yes. Totally. Totally.
I love it. And I just, and I also think, I mean, you know, there was a reason why it took me a year after finishing the first one before I wanted to do a second. You know, like I was just like, I needed time to sort of think about, well, firstly, I wanted to get a job.
Like it was so weird. Like I was doing the magazine and then people my age were like emailing me being like, do you have any internships available at your mag? And I was like, do you know of any internships that I can go to?
Because like I need to apply for them as well. It was like really weird. But yeah, so now that's a really murky answer to your question, Sam.
I'm really sorry. But like, that's the best I've got.
Being as young as you are, I can see why the same avenues of a media that existed when me and Matthew were around your age just don't exist now. So it makes sense to me.
It's been a tough year, right? It's just been really, really, especially this year of all years. It just feels like now is probably not the time to be going into that industry.
I don't know.
Yeah. But it's also inspiring in the same year to see your project, your latest issue just kickstart a target. It's nice to know if you have the right thing angled correctly, that people dig it and will come back and we'll sort of like bankroll it.
That's, I think, important to note in the midst of that, that for the right thing, people will show up.
Yeah, that's one thing I want to jump in on actually, is the idea that the game magazines that are still dying out, they were dying out because they were still on a pre-internet model in the age of the internet, right? Which just isn't compatible really with, like, you know, if you're going to want to look at what a game looks and sounds like, you're going to watch a video online or you're going to look at a screen, like a screenshot online is going to be more accurate than a screenshot on paper. Do you know what I mean?
But I think what Apwot showed with its model is that maybe, because there definitely wasn't anything, at least that I'm aware of, there wasn't anything that was similar to Apwot at the time. And I think it's because it leans so heavily into being something that could only exist in print. Do you know what I mean?
Like having stuff that is like sections that are cut down, or pages that have holes cut out of them, or like different dimensions, different paper stocks, like glow in the dark covers, whatever, like all of this stuff wouldn't be as satisfying in a PDF. So it's kind of like people are willing to support it because it offers something that you just can't conveniently get on the internet, I think. I think that's fair to say.
I think that makes sense. So design is as important in Apwot as the written content. So are you picking pieces on their design potential?
Like what is the... I guess like what is there like a... What's the chicken and egg sort of like genesis of a piece there?
I think I don't know if I put this one in the plan, because I was curious, because when you came to me with Ace Attorney piece, for example, on issue three, you had a very clear idea for this like, it's going to be like a newspaper and, you know, we're going to have it on this slightly different paper. So it was like the design of it was almost as if not more fleshed out than what the content of the piece was going to be. So yeah, this was like a personal curious one from me.
Yeah, so on that one, I can say that basically it's a mix really. So there are some articles where it's just sort of, you let someone sort of write up something that they, you know, that they're passionate about, and then you kind of do illustrations as a response to that. But we're definitely always thinking about what would be a cool visual idea.
I'm trying to think.
I was going to ask about like, what about like the Tim Schafer Raw Shot tests?
Yeah.
Like, did what, because the tests must have come first, I would have thought.
I think the tests were like, I can't remember. I think the tests were like the first thing we did, yeah. And I just made those like with ink and paper.
Like, I just like, I was just making them at home. And then I put them in like a Google Slides doc, and then we sent them to Tim, and then they did that as like part of the interview. It just, that just felt like a fun, that kind of ink block test psychological profile thing felt like a fun thing to do for Tim, considering his sort of gamography, right?
There's stuff like, Simon really wanted to do a microgames article in Issue 3, and the idea with that was that we would get submissions for different microgames from game devs, so from people in the industry, and then we would illustrate them. So throughout that article, which Donlon wrote, which is so good, I really love that article, it's got like these beautiful like little illustrated sort of, kind of in a rhythm heaven kind of art style, just like these little illustrated microgames with a blurb and how you play them. Yoko Shimomura in, that's also Issue 3, that one was like, she can talk about the different music that she's composed, and then we will just do an illustrated response, like a synesthetic illustrated response to that.
So that's all of that, right? All of these like ideas, these like kind of bitty articles with illustration or whatever, they're all kind of trying to lean on the strengths of the mag, right? Like the format of like having original illustration, having like this bespoke look and feel to the whole thing, and trying to think about what's something unique that we can do that, you know, that you, yeah, that you wouldn't be able to see elsewhere, so.
Let's go to some highlights. So what have been some highlights from the first four issues for you?
God.
Is this where you feel too bad about like, if I don't praise everything, then the writers who don't get mentioned.
Yeah, there's a bit of that. There's a bit of that. I love all of the articles like for my children.
That's preface that. Yeah. But there are some children who are more my favorites than others.
And I think, I mean, for me, like as an experience, like, I'm very, very, very happy with in issue one, we, I got to conduct an interview between, you know, I guess, mediate a discussion. But it was an interview between Toby Fox and Jake Kaufman. I know it sounds narcissistic to sort of put a thing that I wrote or was involved with as like the first thing on the list.
It just comes up as a thing because I remember feeling that I was super, super lucky to be in the position that I was. I remember we were doing that interview for time zone reasons. We had to do it like it just went all night.
So it finished at like 6 a.m. and it was the 2019 general election. So I remember waking up to like finishing that interview and just with like two of my heroes, you know, like two of my absolute heroes, like people whose work I really, really admire. That was really, really nice.
That was a highlight for me personally. I think Ashley Burch's piece in Issue 1 did this incredible memoir about voice acting in Life is Strange and how her performance relates to her late partner. And that was the first article that was like ever submitted for the magazine.
And I think when I got that piece, I kind of realized, oh God, I've really got to make this good. Like I cannot make this magazine bad. Because the quality, yeah, the quality of stuff we're getting is just so high.
I sometimes had, rather than sort of a flip of that was, you know, I had like, as long as we have like five really good things, this issue was worthwhile and I don't care if the rest of it's shit. And I'd just be like, I'd get to a point where I'd be like, phew, we've hit the quota for good writing. Like enough of this was okay that I'm not going to feel bad.
Like obviously, I didn't want any of it to be shit, but there is a sense of, you must get occasionally, you just get like, like they say with the Ashley Birch piece, you get something in and you're like, well, whatever happens, this is like worthwhile now because this is good.
Yeah, 100%. I feel that way with the cover stories, you know, I'm just like, well, whatever is in this issue is, but you know, this is why I'm so fascinated. There's so much stuff that I want to ask you guys because I'm constantly sort of, you know, I'm in a very luxurious position really, to be able to make one thing a year and work on it.
You know what I mean? That is a privilege that like is not wasted on me. Like I don't think I could necessarily turn out a product of the same quality.
Like if I was having to do, I mean, when I think about edge and monthly schedules or whatever, it just makes me feel like I don't know how I could survive that. Obviously, there are different templates and strategies in place as to the magazines. Magazines are built around their release schedule, in terms of what is feasible to do within them in that time.
Yeah, I don't know, I mean, sorry.
Well, no, as I was going to say, I mean, first of all, I don't think you should feel guilty about the fact that you don't have to do that. You know, it's not nothing that you created this out of, you know, from such humble beginnings. That's the fact that you were able to create a space for this in the industry is, you know, something you should take pride in.
You did the work. That's just because we got staff right at jobs and gray hair and expanding waistlines from print media. Like, that's not really your problem.
If anything, I think it's amazing that you can have entire issues themed around one subject and then this really clean set of features with amazing design that speak to that one thing. I think what you've made is a lot of print editors dream project, honestly. But you did it first and that's absolutely...
It's not a small thing. So, yeah, I think it's, if anything, I think it's just cool you've been able to find a different paradigm for this stuff to live in, you know?
Yeah, I think like that's all I wrote about this in the forward for the mag is that I did kind of hope that Apwot could demonstrate, like this mag could demonstrate maybe like a slightly different way of doing things and a slightly different way of sort of the business model. I mean, you know, obviously I don't think Apwot is a replacement for the complete gouging that the industry has been through in the last year. Like it's not, we need games writers, you know, we need proper journalists who are paid well and who can spend time working on things.
Because that's, that's for the betterment of all of us really, who care about this industry and care about this medium. But I am glad that if nothing else, Apwot can be this weird little thing that kind of like coexists along whatever the new paradigm is going to be. Because it does kind of feel like the ground is shifting beneath us a little bit.
I don't know if you guys agree with that, but I don't know. Maybe, maybe, maybe GTA, the new GTA comes out and Switch 2 comes out and suddenly the business is booming and everything's fine and everyone gets their jobs back. I don't know.
But, yeah.
Yeah. I think it's more like all the decisions he's made, like bringing Simon on board and the writers, you've got like, you know, like Margaret and Chris Dondon, it shows like it's very good taste. You know, I don't read it and I think they went with that person for this.
And I'll be honest with you, I do that all the time with like so many different things that I consume, you know, in terms of like media.
Yeah, thank you.
But that's again, like given that you are doing this basically fresh, it's not a small thing.
Well, I'm lucky. I just want to say before we move on, I'm very lucky in that I have really good people helping me. You know what I mean?
Like I'm very lucky in that way. Like the stars really aligned to get me access to the people that I did. And I, you know, it wasn't even like a purposeful thing, but it just happened in a way that's wonderful.
My mission with this thing is I'm trying to make the best possible example of like a video game book, basically. I'm trying to make the best and I'm trying to work with like people whose work that I really respect and admire to make that happen. But you know, like this isn't all on my shoulders.
Do you know what I mean? Like I've had, I've got a lot of backers who've helped fund it. And I've had a lot of people, like, you know, Simon has been a huge help as well.
Darren's been a huge help. You know, Jonathan Holmes, basically, I just don't want to, I'm trying to cover my tracks a bit in terms of, yeah.
Simon gave me the most rigorous editing I've had in a long time.
Yeah, nothing gets by him.
That was an ego bruiser, that one.
Why don't you talk about that, Matthew? Because that is interesting in psychs. I got little bits and pieces of that from you while you were writing it, and you are your own worst critic anyway when you write things these days.
But what was that process like? What was it like to write something for Apwot?
You sent me some issues through beforehand, and I'd read those, and I knew the kind of quality of it. Also, just long form writing isn't something I've done a lot of. You know, on magazines, it was very rare, if anything, it was longer than 2,000 words.
That, combined with Shootakumi, literally one of my video game heroes, and wanting to do that well, I was hyper aware of not wanting to waste your access to him.
Right.
Yeah. There was a big soup of anxiety in writing it for all those reasons. But then actually, and it was refreshing, like I say, Simon, he's done a lot more of this long form writing.
He said to me himself actually that he'd been through this. The reason he's quite good at it is that he's been through this process himself at like the New Yorker. I would never be invited to write for the New Yorker.
But so to have my writing passed through someone who is of that standard or whatever, I'd say it's probably more bracing than it wasn't unpleasant. But it was like, because no one had also no one has the fucking time to do that on magazines. You know, production editors will fix.
They won't very rarely, they come to you for clarification or actual tweaks. And yeah, like it was, yeah, it was just, it was just a bit of an eye opener.
Can I jump in?
Yeah, go for it.
Yeah, well, I mean, just basically, I mean, Matthew did such a such a great job. Like I know it was for a bunch of reasons. You were you were kind of second guessing yourself about it.
But it was just it came out so good. It was just the ultimate. It was like the perfect match as well between writer and subject.
I think the fact that Shu was doing like magic tricks for you on the call and stuff, I just think is excellent. You know, it's just it's really good. I'm not sure if like, you know, someone who has such a expansive knowledge of sort of, you know, mystery work and sort of detective stuff, it's just it's just perfect.
But like so, yeah, I hope you don't I hope you feel confident about how that piece came out.
Oh, yeah, I was I actually reread it just before we did this. So I was like, you know, this is all right.
Yeah, I do that with the mag as well. I look through it and I'm like, oh, this is actually not bad.
Yeah, yeah. So that's okay. A lot of it I don't like to go back to, but that was yeah, that was okay.
Simon and I are always talking, though, about like how it's really like for a lot of the people we work with, sometimes it's like the first time that they've had a proper editing pass, which is crazy to think about.
Right. But like that's what I've definitely exchanged messages with other people who've written for you guys who are like, whoa, fuck me.
In a good way or a bad way, what do you mean?
But in a good way, because I was like, I was like, don't worry, like, yeah, like it was, it's not just you, pal.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it just doesn't happen in the game space.
There's no time.
There's just no time.
I mean, that's the thing, yeah. We're trying so hard to like, this is why, okay, when I think about like a sustainable business model for this thing, it's why I'm trying to keep it slow, trying to keep it to one a year. I really want to make sure that on every level, the things that we make, the people who are working for it are happy and they're getting the proper amount of time.
You know, the illustrators are getting the proper amount of time. Everyone's getting paid adequately. Everyone's getting, you know, the breathing room to make something good.
So ultimately, you can make a product or a project like you're happy with. There's absolutely no point. Like, the world does not need more books or more magazines.
It just doesn't. I always, I always think about if you're going to cut down a tree, you have to really feel, I think, that you're justified in doing that. You know what I mean?
Because like the Internet exists, right? It just does. There's no way around that.
So I'm just...
The forests I've destroyed are shitty tips books. You have no idea.
Well, hopefully now it's like, you know, it's all sustainable, sustainably farmed paper and all the rest of it.
This is 2006. We're just letting the planet burn.
Maybe, maybe. I don't know. But yeah, I think it's really nice that we're in a position where we can give people enough breathing room for due process, enough breathing room to make something that they're actually happy with.
I think that's really what makes me... It's so nice to hear from writers saying that they like... Sometimes we hear...
I'm not going to say often, but sometimes we hear that they've had their best experience writing for the mag, which is so nice because some of these journalists have been working for a long time. It's nice. We can be a little oasis in the freelance desert, I guess, for games writers.
I think that one question that's worth asking is whether you have a white whale you dream of securing for Apwot, because I think that I get the impression of what is important to you from the covers and from the content, what the types of games that matter to you. And I can probably imagine what those white whales would be. But I'm guessing you've thought about this before.
Like, what would you really, really like to get on that cover?
I mean, there are so many, right? I mean, I would love to get P Studio, like anyone from the Persona team, I think would be really, really excellent. Hideki Kamiya would be amazing.
Shinji Mikami. I mean, the list goes on. I'm really lucky, though, in that, like, so many of my white whales have already been in the magazine.
Like, we've had Yoko Shimomura, we've had Toby Fox, we've had, you know, just like Keita Takahashi, we've had Tetsuya Mizuguchi, we've had Fumitō Ueda, we've had all of these people. For, like, Rodney Greenblatt, you know, Bennett Foddy. It's just, it is really crazy when you think about the mags.
The mag has only had four issues. The amount of names that we have managed to get in each issue has kind of been, it has been nutty, I think. It's just been completely bonkers.
So I'm already kind of quite satisfied. I mean, basically, obviously, Kojima would be great. There are so many big names, right, that would just be fantastic to get.
I bet you could get P-Studio after you've done the Vanillaware cover.
I hope so, yeah.
I imagine that will be a good, I reckon that will open that door.
We'll see, right? You never know with these things. And as you guys know, right, Access is just such a, what's the best way, it's like a flippant mistress or something.
It's so inconsistent in terms of whether or not you're going to, sometimes it will be like, yeah, no, this is happening, and then it will fall through at the last second, or I'm sure you guys have loads of horror stories about stuff like that happening where it's...
Oh yeah, I've done those horror stories too.
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's just one of those things. One thing I've learned in this whole process is just to never count your chickens before they hatch sort of thing. So I don't know, at this point, I'm not clear what the next cover is going to be, and probably not going to feel clear about it until we have VR commissioned and everything agreed.
Do you know what I mean? Because it's just one of those things where it's just so nerve-racking, like never not knowing whether or not everything's going to bear fruit or not.
Yeah, that makes sense. So if you don't mind us asking, I think you were first with this for sure, like in terms of what it is, and there are other things that have followed in its wake. Apwot has seemingly led to imitators and other prestige magazines doing something similar.
I was really curious to know what you thought of that, as someone who is still relatively new to all this, and the fact that I guess a lot of these things have people with more of myself and Matthew's backgrounds, of old hands and print media making them. What do you make of the fact that it's inspired imitators?
I don't know. I think fundamentally, I think it's a really good thing. I would rather there be more games press and more interesting stuff going on than not.
That's definitely, I think, a good thing. Unambiguously a good thing. I think it is weird.
It definitely was weird at the beginning because the project was from such a personal place. It was ideated and iterated upon itself from me being an art student. I was crazy into illustration.
As a kid, I wanted to be an illustrator. The magazine was like a very, very, like I mentioned earlier, I wanted to do English as well. The magazine came from this thing that was very, very personal to me, like a very personal crossover of my interests and stuff.
It was weird at the beginning to see similar projects come up, often working with the same people and having a smarter business acumen about them. But I think also one thing you just kind of as a bit of an ego diff, you do just kind of need to sort of accept that like you're not the only person with your interests. You know, like there are other people who have the same interests as you.
I do make a point, though, of like I do try hard and like not to pay attention too much to what other people are doing simply because the more of this stuff exists, the more I feel like I would have to sort of, oh, this person's done this with that, therefore, I can't do that. You know, especially when you've got, you know, because art direction is like a thing. You know, you have these relationships with illustrators and stuff, and you're sort of thinking, oh, this person's worked with that person.
Can I work with them? It got to the point where, like, enough of this stuff was cropping up, that it kind of was like robbing me of the joy of sort of making the thing in the first place. I just sort of felt like I was constantly having to think about what other people might be doing, or what other moves other people might be making, when actually none of that really matters to sort of what I need to be getting on with.
I'm very lucky in that I've got a very dedicated and passionate audience, and I can just sort of keep my head down and sort of do my own thing, because I don't want ultimately to this, you know, this thing is my passion. It's not something that I want to turn into a sort of competitive thing, or something that like makes me feel sort of like has me second-guessing myself, depending on like sort of what other people are doing. I just want to be able to make the thing I can in an uncomplicated way, in which I'm not impeded by what other people are doing.
But also beyond that, like I think, you know, if there are a lot of these magazines doing the same thing, and then I'm also looking at their work, it just becomes a bit of an Ouroboros. It becomes a bit of like a snake eating its own tail, and you're kind of all digesting the same resources. Like, I think of what works because I wasn't looking at any of that stuff.
I was looking at Little White Lies. I was looking at Elephant Magazine. I was looking at stuff like that was there beyond games, you know?
So I think it's just, I think it's a bit of a trap to like even spend any time at all, like fretting or thinking too much about like what other people are doing. Obviously, that's easier said than done, especially when you're like, you're a very small company. You know, it's usually just me on my own with Simon helping.
And then I tag people in, like in terms of like the core team, you know, Darren helps and you know, like it's not, I don't have a PR person. I don't have all of this stuff. So it's very easy when you're in a position where you're sort of doing, when you got a small company to sort of take things personally.
So I'm trying very hard, like, you know, to just sort of focus on the thing that like I really enjoy, which is making the thing and sort of, and being proud of like the stuff that I can achieve with it. Cause I am, I do really.
That makes sense. I mean, I totally get the idea of not trying to tune in too much to other people's wavelengths. Like I don't, I don't think me or Matthew, either of us listen to many games podcasts really.
We tend to take inspiration from elsewhere. But I mean, you are coming up with this, you know, like beautiful puzzle themed issues with like Portal 2 on the cover with this gorgeous bespoke artwork. We're coming up with games score.
I mean, these are like, not quite the same thing.
Games score is up there. No, I can test that. I can test that.
Like the thing, look, like, but like that is the thing, right? Like no matter what creative thing that you're doing, I just don't think it's healthy to spend time looking at like what other people, like you kind of do need to keep an eye out. Obviously you can't completely bury your head in the sand or whatever, but even for, you know, a podcast or whatever it is, I think, you know, if you just spend too much time fretting about that, it just impedes, I think your own ability to do the thing that you're meant to be doing.
Like, I think Back Page is good because it comes from, it's very clearly coming from you both. Do you know what I mean? You're not looking at trends and chasing what's popular or like doing other formatted stuff.
Or are you? I don't know. Maybe maybe I'm wrong about that.
Yeah, we are just doing a horrible job.
Yeah, wasn't Gamescore actually based on something else from that film podcast that you listened to? I can't remember. Was that?
No, that's Gamescore. It's a true original.
That's the only original thing we've really come up with.
Okay, my bad, my bad, my mistake.
But that's okay. I was only joking anyway. But last thing I want to ask you then, Cass, as we wrap up is, can you tell us because issue four is available now, right?
People can buy that. Can you also talk about what else is coming up in issue five? I think that would definitely be of interest to our listeners as we give people a little push towards your Kickstarter.
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I mean, so, yes, so in issue five, do I put on my salesman's voice for this or do I just talk like a normal person?
Just talk in your regular voice.
Good advice. Thank you. I'll take that.
Yeah, no, issue five. So yeah, obviously the cover story for this is a huge deep dive into the making of Unicorn Overlord, which is like a really fantastic, beautiful strategy RPG from Vanillaware, who are an amazing studio based in Osaka. And that's by Margaret Robertson, who's done like an amazing job.
Other highlights, I guess. I'm really happy about, we've got Donlon writing about Snake, which is going to be a banger, I'm sure.
As in the mobile phone?
Yeah, the Nokia mobile phone game. I think he's going to do like, well, actually, I don't need to say I think. I've read it.
He's done an amazing job on that. Let's see. I'm really excited.
Simon's going to be interviewing or has done an interview with Ute Saito. I mean, Seaman is like one of my favorite little sort of Dreamcast oddities. You guys are both familiar with it.
I'm sure your listeners are as well. But it's like one of the, I guess, like the first, I don't know, not the first, but like the big prominent sort of like AI sort of driven virtual pet. Just really exciting, really, really happy about it.
But we managed to sort of get him to take part in that. That's really cool. Cat Bailey from IGN's Cat Bailey is going to be doing like a sort of kind of like deep dive, introspective look into sort of the Suikoden series, like Suikoden 1 and 2 specifically, with a focus on sort of the legacy of like the late Yoshitaka Murayama, who was very responsible for those games' identities.
Is this sounding good? I don't know.
Yeah, it's just sounding great. It's good subject matters, it's good writers. What I like is that you kind of put out, you sort of tell people a little bit, a few things that are coming, and then closer to the time, you kind of, you tend to sort of, you go, this is it, this is the sort of final thing.
And I quite like the cadence of that. It's quite exciting to get that final rundown where you're like, and there's all this stuff too.
Yeah, yeah.
You've got a very cool sounding Donkey Kong 64 piece in there as well. You've got as many interviewees for that piece. I think five, is there are types of collectible in that game?
So that's like, really fun. I'm glad you picked up on that. That was exactly, that was the intent for sure.
That was definitely what we were doing.
That's really cool. So that's on Kickstarter now. So issue four then, which people can just buy right now and assuming you have not sold out of it.
No, we printed loads. We printed loads. But yeah, please, please.
We've also got back issues. I think issue three has sold out, but we've got special editions of issue three, which has like a thermochromic ink cover, which like, it's like, if you imagine Trico from The Last Guardian, but like obscured in shadow, if you like touch him with warm hands, he'll like appear in front of you. It's quite cool.
So if you want issue three, you can get that one.
Nice.
Yeah.
Okay, great. Well, where can people get you on social media? And to find out more or just see what you're up to?
Okay. Well, I think the best thing to do would be to follow. So the magazine is Apwotmag.
So A-P-W-O-T-M-A-G. That's us on Twitter. On Blue Sky, it's just apwot.bluesky.social.com.
And then I don't think you should follow me, frankly, actually. Like, I'm not worth it. I'm not a good follow.
So don't follow me. Follow the mag. And you can go to shop.apwot.com if you guys want to buy it.
And we're on Kickstarter. I'm trying to think, is there anything else I need to plug? And then just look up Apwot on your social media of choice.
We'll probably be there. So, yeah.
Awesome. Well, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us, Cass. It's been great.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah. Matthew, where could people find you on social media?
I am at MrBasilPestoNoUnderscore on BlueSky and MrBasilUnderscorePesto on Twitter, but I'm trying not to use it as much. So go to BlueSky.
Yep. And same, Samuel Dolby Roberts on BlueSky and Twitter. The podcast is at Back Page Pod.
If you like the work we do and you want to support us, get two extra podcasts a month and a monthly newsletter. Matthew wrote this month's newsletter. It's a banger.
It has Ace Attorney stuff in there, mystery books about novelty houses in Asia that kill people. That's on their patreon.com/backpagepod. And yeah, thank you so much for listening.
We'll be back this week with a new episode. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye now.
