Hello, and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how is it going genuinely on this Monday night? Are you well?
Yeah, I'm well. A little bit tired after the working day. There was a stream on Friday at the company, and they got a lot of snacks in to support the people doing the stream.
So I've been working my way through the leftover snacks. I was eating these incredibly anemic, individually wrapped panna chocolas.
How many did you have to eat collectively to add up to a whole one?
I would say each one was a whole panna chocola. They weren't tiny. They were almost like vacuum packed or something.
I don't really know what was going on with them, but yeah, I ate some of those today.
Nice, and that was pretty much your day, so that's good.
I ate a Galaxy Ripple. I've got this new bit I do at the office that my desk neighbor really hates, where I eat a Galaxy Ripple and it's really flaky, and then I deliberately let a flake of it melt onto my lip and pretend I don't know.
Yeah, are you a scumbag, Matthew?
It happened once for real, and they made too much of a fuss about it, so now I actively encourage it.
So this is your life forever now, is me doing this, basically. I admire how obnoxious that is. That's good.
Well done. I had a slightly uneventful weekend, I suppose, but I played a bit of Pacific Drive. I played a bit of that, which is a very intricate game.
I haven't quite got my arms around, and therefore don't feel like I can talk about it with great authority on this episode. But I kind of almost admire how complex it is. All these different car parts, you have to think about and upgrade.
The simple act of getting out of your car, you have to flick the, turn the key, and then touch the handbrake, all that stuff. I sound like a guy who doesn't drive, don't I? Yeah, I'm sort of very unconvincing.
That sounds like me after my nine tests.
That's you getting driven around by Catherine. Don't forget to touch the brake! That's you in the car in the passenger seat.
But there is a whole bunch of stuff, cool stuff that we're going to talk about in this episode, Matthew. I'm excited to get into some, what we've been playing, sort of gubbins, because it's been a little while since we've done one. I think we skipped February entirely for these episodes, so nice to get a refresher on what's going on.
It is a preposterously stacked start to the year. It feels like there's four or five Game of the Year contenders in the ether already, or at least, you know, top ten, sort of vying for top ten slots. Do you think that's a fair assessment of where it's at with games?
But it's become increasingly this way. I still don't really understand why it is, like, whenever I go to press events this time of year, there's inevitably the conversation where we're like, oh, it's a bit busy, isn't it? All these great games coming out.
I wonder why that is. Always hoping that the gaming PRs or marketing people, whoever in the room, will offer me some, like, magic insight as to, oh, well, it's this. This is the definitive answer why.
I haven't got it yet, but I am, I'm always happy to have it. I mean, it's great to come back and get straight into it in the new year.
Yeah, I think so, especially because a lot of the stuff that has wowed me or is wowing other people was not on my radar at all at the start of the year. So that's quite a nice surprise, whether it's something, you know, kind of indie shaped or whether it's like a, you know, weekly there is a new live service game coming out basically from like Power World to Helldivers and Shrouded. There's just a whole bunch of these things.
So yeah, it's exciting year no matter what your sort of flavor of game is, I think. So that is exciting.
I think there's just an appetite for there always to be something amazing. So we anoint something amazing regardless.
I think it is honestly just a logjam caused by the pandemic sort of like big money times. That's my theory is that it's just that it takes roughly three to four years to make a game now, maybe even slightly longer than that. But, you know, it's sort of like if you were green lighting stuff back then, sort of maybe more of the indie sized games, then maybe it makes sense that you can get those games to market now.
And therefore there are fucking loads of them. Yeah, I think we basically are in the sort of like, you know, the sort of like the Great Gatsby Good Times before the Wall Street Crash comes basically. So enjoy it, my friend.
That's a lot bleaker than I intended to be.
The fun day of the Baz Luhrmann film with all the cool music and fireworks.
Yeah, before, you know, Gatsby gets spoiler alert killed at the end. And it's the end of the good news.
Spoiler alert, I can't believe you just ruined Great Gatsby.
It's available in the public domain. People should have read it by now on a PDF on their iPads.
Yeah, that's on you.
Yeah, exactly. So, what we've been playing, and I think that the, undoubtedly the event to get into here is you have played Final Fantasy VII Remake through to its completion. But I don't know how you've done this.
You did Like A Dragon, Infinite Wealth. And you've done Final Fantasy VII Remake. And now you're significantly into Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
And all of that has happened since the start of the year. Would you like to explain what happened, Matthew?
It's the motivation of work. So Infinite Wealth, I had to review. So that drove me to complete it and just cram it into every hour of the day.
I've got this new routine, which helps in that I wake up a little early and I try and play an hour and a half of games before I go to work. It slowly adds up, you know? You kind of sort of chip away at these things.
I've had some pretty good weekends where I've selfishly just sat in the living room for both Saturday and Sunday playing games. That's helped. We're doing a couple of shorter episodes a month.
That helps.
Yeah, that is good. I'm glad that sort of paid off.
This very episode is the reason why I'm able to play these games. Honestly, it is the motivation thing. Infinite Welfare Review, Remake, because I knew Rebirth was coming up and I really wanted to play that and I knew I was going to have to talk about it for work as well.
So, Remake, I absolutely mainlined. I played that incredibly fast. I say incredibly fast.
I still, I don't know, it took me like 35 hours or something. You know me, if I've got a mission, it kind of gets me going.
Yeah, for sure. So, this is a good time for this, obviously, because Rebirth is out by the time people are listening to this. So, it has scored better reviews than any Final Fantasy has in recent memory.
I don't think since 12 has a game drawn this much acclaim in that series. So, it seems like it's getting a lot of, you know, really kind of positive reception. But I'm kind of interested in your little journey with Final Fantasy 7, Matthew, because you played Disc 1 last year for this podcast, and it was, I think, one of our best episodes last year.
People really liked it, I think, you discovering this for the first time. And now you have played more Final Fantasy 7 technically than I have, which is an amazing sort of leapfrog act you've done. Very impressed.
So, I suppose to start with, what did you make of Remake? And coming to it this late, I suppose, what sort of preconceptions did you have going in and what was the reality versus those preconceptions?
I'd been told that it did the iconic set pieces in really pleasing ways and that was the game at its best, but that there was almost like twice as much game which was filler in between and not very good. And that's kind of true. I guess that's the obvious take and one that I mostly believe.
I will say I never had a terrible time with it because I like fundamentally really enjoyed the combat in it. So as long as combat's happening, I was having a pretty good time. Like if it asked me to do like a long sewer sequence or one of several construction yards or building sites or, you know, variations of that, you know, as long as I was smashing stuff up with the combat, which I thought was quite well judged and quite well pitched in terms of difficulty, I didn't really mind.
It has a great soundtrack. That really helps. So even if it is like, oh, you've got to spend an hour turning off some giant light bulbs for some reason.
You know, you're doing it to like some crazy remix of a tune that was really good in Final Fantasy VII. So you don't really mind. Like your head's kind of bopping along to it.
It is incredibly bloated, but it was made with love and the sequences that were great were really great. And it ends on a height. Like I really loved the whole Shinra sequence.
Maybe I came out with a bit of a buzz from the whole Shinra HQ climbing that. And like visually, it just looked so good. I mean, it was a PS4 game first.
I was playing on PS5, but I was just really impressed with the production values of it. It just felt like enormous in places, given that it only had like a handful of locations. I thought they really sold you on the scale of the city.
And that was, it was just really neat. I can't really remember what your take on remake was back in the day.
Yeah, I think, so I think I put it in the middle of my top 10 of that year. I don't think it got near the top. And I think that was because I think I thought that because it was only set in the slums primarily, as in the space you can actually explore and sort of like, you know, and where most of the game is set is basically, you know, two towns, a train station and some corridors in between.
It was a little bit like the canvas was too small. I kind of got why they did it that way. And I sort of always knew in the back of my mind that if they did this first one, they could kind of crack the mechanics and the combat and, you know, just so many elements of the game.
And then the next one or the next two, as it would turn out, could then build on that and take us out into what we know is the, you know, huge world of really cool locations and different bits and pieces that await players beyond Midgar. And so I thought it was a little bit like, I think I said as well that there was a pandemic element at play. So, you know, I remember spending a very miserable birthday in April 2020, just playing this.
And like, it's got quite a sort of downbeat tone anyway, I think, when you're going around Midgar. It's kind of like there's that very gentle sort of like guitar track that plays quite mournful. And there was something about that and the pandemic combined that just caused quite a lot of psychic damage, not the developer's fault, but it was the timing of when it arrived.
The other thing I think you've got in your favor is you don't have the baggage of having waited for a remake of this game. So you haven't you didn't have the thing where, you know, there was a PS3 tech demo they did where, you know, they showed the very start of the game and cloud and that tease that turned out to be for nothing. And then 2015, they finally announced they're doing it.
And then they scrapped that version of it and get, you know, and bring it in house. And then you have to wait another five years for it to arrive. So I think after all that, the fact that it was just Midgar.
And, you know, I think it pretty much ticked all the boxes to me. Otherwise, I love the combat. I thought the combat was really well judged.
Kind of mix of sort of the in-between point of Final Fantasy 13 and Final Fantasy 15, really, just sort of like, you know, it has elements of turn-based combat to it. It has the stagger stuff from 13. It's sort of like, yeah, I guess it's like in the middle of a triangle between FF7, 15 and 13.
And I think that just really hit the spot. And like you, I did really like the Shinra finale. The cavalcade of boss fights at the end, I found quite gruelling, particularly the sort of like the one you fight when you're on a motorcycle.
Just remember that being such a fun...
Yeah, that is a bit tough.
Yeah, I think such a great fun sequence in the original game as well. Just that minigame of just like whacking those dudes with their buster sword and then it's a boss fight and then you move on. It's a really nice...
In this, it was hard enough that I was like, oh, it's making me question how I felt about this part of the game originally to begin with and I don't know how I feel about it. And then the other thing I had was they brought the Sephiroth stuff way forward from where it is in the actual game. And I think that robs the character of his mystique a little bit.
Yeah.
But I say all that and I still really liked it for the most part. I thought I like the ways it expanded on the story. I like the characterization I think was a bit stronger.
The Square Enix are really, really good at localizing their games. So the dialogues just really spawn as well.
Apart from the rest of Avalanche, they are bad hangs. Not just Jesse, who has already anointed bad, worst hang romantic in our Patreon episode, but also Biggs and Wedge. I just found them lame comic side characters.
Yeah. I suppose the other thing I didn't really know how to feel about was, I remember going into 7 Remake thinking, they were going to move away from Crysis Core. They were kind of like, oh, well, you know, this is its own thing.
You know, Zack was not part of the story and all this stuff. And I thought, well, I really like Crysis Core. I thought it was one of the stronger spin-offs.
And I thought it would have no bearing whatsoever on the remake. Little did I know it has a fucking massive bearing on the remake. And you just have to wait until the very end for it to become clear why that is, as there's basically an alternate ending to Crysis Core that intersects with the story of the original FF7.
I don't really know where that was going. So that was a bit of a question mark to end with. But I liked it overall.
That's a long answer to your question, Matthew.
Maybe I'm in a bit of a honeymoon period in front of Anti-Seven. But I was just really up for it. It's really shiny as well.
And the thing they really get is they know that when you get to certain locations, the ones which are like seared on your mind, they really have to go all out and deliver. So there are like individual rooms. Like when you go into the Mako, Mako, how do you pronounce it?
Reactors, the kind of reveal of those rooms and the scale of them. And that's where like the graphics are their shiniest. Like, yes, you've got all this kind of junkyard that looks a bit shitty, but they know where to push the budget.
If you are a fan, dare I say student of AAAXS, stuff like that is very pleasing to me, you know?
Yeah, I get that. And it's sort of, again, I think just coming to it years later when no one else is talking about it and people are just hyped for the new one, it's probably like quite a good frame of mind to go into it with. So, yeah, I could see why that would be appealing.
Do you think they nailed the combat, Matthew? What is it about the combat you think they got right?
It did take a while for me to kind of click with it because, you know, you go in with this like real time mindset and actually it's sort of not, you know, like the real time moves you do are charging up the ATB bar which is then for abilities and spells and it's about strategically using those at very precise moments to dig into this pressure staggering system and each enemy has basically a particular combo of moves that will like unlock it and then let you absolutely murder it at speed. And if you don't get to those combinations, the fights can be quite gruelling or very drawn out. You're just chipping away at this bar and not really doing anything.
But when you start kind of using the assess skill to kind of read into people and you start playing more with the kind of materia, that side of it really comes out. And if anything actually it kind of leans into something that I really love about materia in the original Final Fantasy 7, you know, which is like how sort of versatile it is, except here, you know, you're almost encouraged to re-equip that stuff for specific individual fights. You know, I was constantly changing up what I had equipped and like the whole strategy of the game was rather than just bulldozing through with your kind of preferred build.
This thing really will not go down unless you've got lightning in this precise moment or whatever, you know, skill it was. And I just thought that had a kind of depth and richness to it, which which actually did sustain the game for like 30 hours or whatever. Like I was constantly changing up my sets and you know, I felt like I was really engaging with that side.
And that's definitely something like when you go into Rebirth, you know, I feel like they're a lot more ambitious with that off off the bat because they're like, well, you've you've probably spent the game getting your head around this. So we'll give you quite a lot of material and you can just go and start having fun instantly. So yeah, that's probably the thing I rate most about it.
It's given that my big problem with 16 was I thought the combat system or maybe the enemies they threw you just like ran out of steam or it was asked to fill out a game that was just way too long for how much depth there was in that combat. You know, I felt like I did the same combo 500 times in that game once I'd worked out how to stagger things. And this this game, I never found that cheese tactic.
So really, really good stuff.
Yeah, it's you know, it was the part they had to get right more than anything else, right? Because if they got it wrong, you had two more games of it. So, you know, basically those fundamentals had to be correct.
And I agree. I think as well, it just felt like all those characters were meticulously animated, beautifully designed. They just felt like so deluxe to sort of control.
They put so much thought into how Barrett plays completely differently to Tifa. And when they didn't do Red 13 as a playable character, and when in the new one, they were like, we're not doing Sid and Vincent. I was like, I understand, because it's like the work you must have to do to bring one character to life in this way you've done the combat system must be an incredibly huge amount of work.
So I get it, you know, I get it. And yeah, there's so much depth within those individual characters. And then the way they interlock is another thing for you to think about.
Yeah, I couldn't ask for more from that side of the game. So the one more thing I wanted to... Okay, there's two more things I actually want to ask about before we get into Rebirth, because I think these will be relevant to discussing that just from what I...
what you told me over pizza on Saturday about your experience playing Rebirth, Matthew, is the... how do you feel about the side quests in the game? So they were a little bit more controversial.
I think side content in Final Fantasy generally has had, you know, a little bit of scrutiny. This came up with 16 as well. How do you feel about retrieving urchins, etc.
The framing of them was really poor, random, slum people with quite boring slum problems, which didn't really add much to the game. That thing you said about, like, it's two slums and some corridors. So much of the game was just run up and down these corridors between these two locations.
There are a couple of arena offshoots, which they all get reused about, like, ten times because there's just no real estate in these game Thor quests are happening. I think if those same quests were just in a more open space, they might seem less problematic. It's just that it was so strictly linear between them.
That's why you really felt like, oh, I've taken this particular route. I know the fastest route around this area of the slums, so I've walked it, like, 20 times today. That's where it becomes quite a bad hang.
But also just lacking charm and humour, I thought. Very, like, my first side quests, I didn't think the writing in them was very good.
Yeah, it's the thing where I think in terms of main quest pacing, these games are really, really good now. And, you know, I just think that it was such a long period where Japanese RPGs were being dinged in comparison to Western RPGs, where I think, like, now they're more on a level playing field. And side quests are kind of like the one thing where, you know, there's still work to be done, maybe, on the Square Enix Final Fantasy side.
But, yeah.
The one that was pure death is in the second slums area where Aerith's mom lives. There's a load of quest givers and quest targets in, like, a little group, like a secret The Urchin Club, or, like, there's these kind of kids. And to get to them, you have to slide through this gap.
And it's one of those very slow, long, like, loading gaps. And every time I did that, I was really like, just, fuck, fuck the people who made this. Fuck these kids.
And fuck anyone who gave me these quests. I had to get incredibly efficient, so I have to make that, I mean, probably only a six, seven second journey, but enough to be, you know, you look at that gap and go, you know what, I don't want to cash in these Moogle medals. Like, that's fine.
I'm just, I'm just, I am less interested in what I could get from the kid dressed as a Moogle than I am going through that gap for six seconds. That's the worst bit of the game, that one corridor.
That's really funny. Yeah, I think it's, it's just weird because there's so much love put into stuff like, you know, the way they frame Hell House in FF7 remake is that's like the awareness of the audience and what they want to see from that remake. And they demonstrate it so, so well in many moments across the game.
And then, yeah, you get to the side quests, they just don't seem to have the same amount of consideration, behind them, which is just a shame because there's so much else, so much good stuff going on elsewhere. Imagine me waist size expanding massively as I eat buffalo chicken wings in the pandemic in 2020, squeezing through that gap to get those medals and retrieve those urchins. I was just like, it's a no from me dog at the time.
You are right about the general tone of it is quite dour.
Yeah.
You know, like even your moments of victory is like seen as these acts of terrorism and every time you blow up a Mako reactor or whatever, you come out of it and you see loads of people like screaming in the streets because you've blown up part of the town and they're all having a terrible time too. Like you definitely feel like a bit of an asshole in that game. Yeah.
I've seen some people like complain particularly about Cloud, how grim he is through the whole game. It's difficult because it's the first act of that character's arc. You can't have him like cheer up in the course of one game because that will fuck like the next two parts of this remake.
So he doesn't really get to evolve at all and he does have to stay like reasonably one note just sort of shrugging everything off, which doesn't seem as apparent when you play the original game because it's like five, six hours. But after 30, 40 hours of it, you are like, oh my God, like this guy really needs to light an arc. That's part of it.
I could see that being quite a bad pandemic hang.
Yeah, for sure. You know, it's sort of like those things just seem to align accidentally as a fluke of the universe basically. But there were like, there's definitely like moments in it where, you know, there are some like good moments of levity.
Like there's the bit where Barrett says to Cloud, like, you used to think you were a little shit with a big attitude and a bigger inferiority complex, quite possibly the worst person I have ever met. And that is the only line that got like a laugh out loud from me, basically. I was just like, that's so funny, that's such a great little bit of script writing.
So I saw sort of like the potential for levity in there, but yeah, it was, it was just, I think it's dour by nature really. And like, I think in some ways, the single location thing is quite, is quite effective for mood setting. It's sort of like, you just know that your, your end, the very end of the game will be, you will escape this basically.
And actually, that's quite, that's quite a good sort of like hook for an arc, I think, even if it is very limiting in terms of location. What I think they could have done is, you know how at the very start, you see little bits of the city, like when you, it's like the very start of the game, when you see like Sephiroth down like an alleyway and then there's all these shops around, like that whole area, I don't know why they didn't just let you go back to places like that, I guess, because you've been hunted by Shima, but you know, just to sort of add a new town or something like that. I think that sort of thing might have, might have helped, you know.
Yeah, absolutely. Why not let us go back?
Yeah, so last thing I want to ask about then before we get into Rebirth. So what did you make of the story in the sense of the changes they made to the original 7 story? Because that was, you know, a topic of much discussion.
How do you feel about it?
Gradually came to be on board with it. Part of me was thinking the whole time, well, if they, you know, if they set out to remake this thing, they've kind of gone a step beyond. It's almost like they're like, oh no, we're gonna, we're not just remaking it, we're gonna kind of comment on the nature of remaking it and it's gonna become incredibly meta, where it's enough of an achievement to just have remade it.
And like, the best bits are things that all happen in the original game, kind of fleshed out to be more substantial. So then the idea of going, oh no, but it's this on top. I think if you were playing this and you hadn't played the original for the first time, it would be confusing as shit.
Like genuinely quite a flawed introduction of these things. And the fact that they're sort of throughout the game, like the whispers come in very early and I was like, what the fuck? What's going on with this?
Like I don't, I wasn't really on board with that. They sort of explain it at the end. I did have to read some articles online, so I was like, I don't really know what just happened there.
It just got in the way of the simple pleasure of doing the good events of a pre-existing game in a flashier setting. Like that would have been enough. And that was the stuff I reacted to.
Whether it like fundamentally earned its place because, you know, mild spoilers for a remake, it suggested that what this new storyline is doing is proposing a version of the story where things can change. It's saying this isn't going to play out exactly the same way. And so that promise will hang over what you play going forwards and make the whole thing a bit more exciting.
Maybe I do appreciate that because you're like, okay, like, you know, all bets are off. I'm kind of down with that. But it's quite a convoluted and invasive way of setting up like they could have just done that at the end.
And you could have enjoyed, you know, maybe a five hour shorter adventure and had a kind of cleaner bit of fan service for that time and then just had some bullshit at the end. And it probably would have had the same effects.
Yeah, I think I think that's probably the right way of looking at it. I think people saw it as a bit of the a bit of the Kingdom Hearts in Final Fantasy Seven, you know, as in making it unnecessarily complicated, adding new elements that weren't there before that then add like layers you have to think about. But it kind of adds up to stuff that you don't really you don't you just it just feels a bit incoherent in the moment that you don't and you don't know what the creative decision making you don't understand why it was seen as a net gain over just remaking the original, you know.
So yeah, kind of an interesting one. All right, then, Matthew, any other closing thoughts on remake before we switch to rebirth?
It's really good and worth playing, I had a good time with it and the best bits are pretty special.
Do you do the Yuffie bits as well?
No, I watched Catherine play the Yuffie DLC though, so I understood the story.
That's the only key thing really, it's just like a couple of new cutscenes that lead into rebirth. But that's kind of it really. Okay, interesting.
So then, rebirth, Matthew, you sounded pleased as punch about this game when I spoke to you on Saturday. What's the deal?
I'll say upfront, like, obviously people are just playing this game for the first time, I don't want to scare them off and spoil it for them. I haven't quite finished it, I'm about fifty hours into it, probably about two thirds of the way through I think, gauging on where I'm at in comparison to the original story. And I think the plan is still to do a standalone episode about this at some point.
Yep, in mid-March, it's our mid-March episode.
So we'll get into the meat of it there. Basically it does everything that I liked in remake, but tenfold. I think it has obviously much more variety of iconic moments to play with.
And the way it grows all those moments out is as good as what they do with the wall market, say, in remake. It's that level of love and attention where they're like, well, let's take this core idea and what more can we do with it? So you know, you end up with as substantial re-workings of like the Junon parade or sailing across from Junon to Coasterdale Soul or going to the Gold Saucer.
And that stuff's great because when you get to the stuff you really remember, let's pull out the stops. Let's make sure this thing is fucking spectacular. Let's make sure these are the best looking bits.
Let's make sure there's loads of really interesting stuff to do there. Let's make sure we do the kind of core moments really well. So like when you're doing the parade, let's make sure that's like a really good, interesting minigame and you know, will kind of serve the cherished memory of it or whatever.
I just think that's such a good approach and after you've done a couple of like memorable moments you just begin to like anticipate each one and they really don't miss. I mean that's it's felt like a series of escalating like, oh man, they really nailed that. You know, when you go to the Gold Saucer, that's meant to be one of the glitziest places in the planning.
It has, you know, if you remember from the original game, the Gold Saucer's got like all these different zones with like really distinctive looks and they just haven't like skimped on like any production value or set design and that's what I was really reacting to. You just see so much more than slums in this game. They really get it and they really get what excited people about this stretch of journey in Disc 1.
I think I could be as bold as to say whatever your favourite part is of this stretch of the journey, it's done really well. I don't think there's anything that feels substantially caught. Bar one thing which I won't spoil and let people discover for themselves, there's like a quite a key location which doesn't appear but I would say for maybe obvious reasons, there's just so much of it.
20 remakes it almost feels like.
Blimey.
Like that's how much more stuff there is in this game. Fuck me, they were just building, you know? They worked out the systems for remake and then they just spent four years just making stuff to fill this game and it's largely like quantity and quality.
Fuck, gotta play this. I wanna play this so bad. It was the other thing that really sort of surprised me was you told me the side content.
First of all, when we went for pizza the other day, we both had a meat feast by the way for those curious. The meat feast at the Green Park Brasserie pizza place.
Meat feast, a diet coke and a regular coke.
Yes, exactly. And you told me the side quests, you compared them to Yakuza and you also said they're really good in comparing them. So I'm just curious to know, have they nailed that side of things for the first time, Matthew?
I was probably being a bit over-excitable with that description. I think there is a bit of Yakuza in here. I think one thing that they do is there's loads of bespoke mini games, which is maybe where I get the Yakuza kind of connection from.
I mean, I would say verging on maybe like a hundred, like it feels like there's hundreds of the things. I mean, there's loads of games in this and a lot of them have a quest that surfaces those games. So that's part of it.
Another part of it is that framing is just a lot funnier. You meet some much weirder characters, you know, some very strange things happen. A lot of the quests have like punch lines to them as opposed to just get me this suit, mister.
Thanks, mister. You've made our lives better in the slums. End of quest, you know, which absolutely sucks and isn't entertaining at all.
But here they always try and kind of cram in the gags and it's a much funnier game. Like if your memories of the comedy in the first game, you know, are bigs and wedge being chronically unfunny, this seems like it was written by slightly different people or something. I think it's very light on its feet.
It's got much jollier vibes.
Avalanche have really caught some strays on this podcast of late.
They really suck, I really do think they are spectacularly bad hangs. It's partially also that they're visually, they're such a step down from the main characters. And because they're in the same room as them, you just look at the big, the fat one, whatever his name is.
Wedge, I think he's Wedge.
Wedge. He just looks like he's got like no texture to him, like he just, he looks just like a dot like a doll next to T-Fake, it's really, it's just, it's fucked up and weird, I don't like him. There's none of that in this, you know, all the characters are just like mega models.
I mean, the NPCs are a little, a little simpler. Another thing they do that kind of gives it this hook is every side quest has a member of the party as a kind of sidekick during it. They use that to deepen Cloud's bonds with those characters and explore those characters sort of backstories a bit.
And I think it's valid criticism of Final Fantasy 7, Disc 1, which I have played, so maybe they fix this later in the game. But a lot of those characters are like out of sight, out of mind, you know, you have the people in your party. If they don't have a very specific story beat on the main quest storyline, like Yuffie doesn't do anything, Kaseyff doesn't do anything, but here they're always drawing them into these side quests so you aren't just hunting for like, who stole a lot of chocobos from this farm, you're doing it with Red 13 and he's kind of chatting to you the whole way and you just come out the end going, oh, this party really matters?
Like I spent a load of time with these people and you get to make decisions in a lot of the quests which change like your relationship for the positive or worse I guess with these characters and as far as I can tell and I haven't got to this bit yet, the whole relationship system in this game is basically there to decide who you go on a date with at Gold Saucer in the famous dating scene. So that whole thing is just there for like this stupid punchline at Gold Saucer which I think is indicative of the ludicrous level they've gone to in this game to try and pad things out in the name of quite frivolous entertainment but it's a mode that really suits them. I know we overuse this but it's just an epically good hang, this game.
That's great to hear. Interesting. Yeah, the date thing is one of those much discussed moments from the game that is ultimately not very significant so I quite like the idea that they've hinged a lot of the side content around that.
That sort of makes sense because it's really confusing in the original why it happens the way it does.
Yeah, because here basically every time you get to a town there will inevitably be a scene where everyone splits up and you can walk around and talk to them and you get to see there's a little symbol above them which sort of tells you the depth of your relationship so you can sort of see the people you maybe need to do a bit more work on and I don't know if you're meant to deliberately game it so that you end up going on a date with the person you want to go on, Tifa, of course, but yeah, Tifa. How old is Yuffie meant to be?
I think she's like a teenager but I think like probably like 16, 17. Are you asking if it's okay for you to date Yuffie?
Yeah, that's a tough break.
I think she's sort of like, yeah, should we just find out her age and say we are, she's 16 years old, Matthew. She's only 16 years old.
Yeah, that's it. She's only 16 years old. That's what Barrett says to you.
It's a bit where Barrett does a perfect Michael Caine impression and you're like, wow, this game's got it all. Okay. Well, listen, it's Tifa.
Tifa is the one I want to go on a date with.
Right. I like the idea as well that you're like, okay, so women who are out, ones who might die as a result of this story and teenagers. So who's left?
Tifa's left. Great. That's your criteria, basically.
Though Aerith is much improved in this game, I think. I didn't hate her in Remake, but given what the story is about, they know that and they make her almost as much of a sort of linchpin of the whole party as Cloud and they're definitely working up to that. But I haven't got there yet and the game has really planted the idea of like, well, maybe it's not going to end the way you think it's going to end, which would be kind of crazy.
But I'm excited to see where the story is going, which for a remake of a very well established story is quite a good achievement, I think.
I think so, yeah. Okay, so I've got about one week until people just start tweeting out, oh, it was crazy when they did this at the end, like Alan Wake 2 musical gif style. You know what I mean?
So yeah.
This game is like, there's so much you can spot, like I'm really on eggshells with this because there's stuff that I think is ruining a good joke is almost as bad as ruining a big plot twist or whatever. And it is genuinely funny. Like I've laughed out loud, you know, several times in this game, which I just didn't think was going to be the case coming into it.
Red 13 is really funny, it's like they picked one character and went, let's put a lot of effort into making Red 13 like a really good hang in this game. And it's funny that there's this talking dog in your party and, you know, maybe that's a little bit of like Marvel thinking, I don't know. But it's a bit like, you know, when you get the Marvel reviews, they're like, oh, wait until you get this one character and it's not the character you think is going to be, but there's one really funny character in this film.
I realised I'm doing that for Rebirth, but it's good, it's good.
The MCU's problem wasn't necessarily like furry companions who are cracking wise. It was just bad films, really. And our beloved Eternals, of course.
Okay, interesting stuff, Matthew. So I think that's probably enough FF7 Rebirth chat for now, because like you say, people are just getting into it.
So I realised I've eaten up a huge chunk of it. So with my... I mean, it is really all I've done for a month.
So it's absolutely fine, because I think as well, it's the thing people will want to hear about but they won't want it any more, spoilery than that. I have been deliberately avoiding, I've avoided the last two trailers, I didn't watch the director, didn't play the demo. I've just avoided all of it, because I'm just like, I'm going in fresh and that's what's going to happen.
So well, I really hope you like it, because I'd feel like I'm a bit of a phony FF7 fan or late to the party on it. So, I don't have that same relationship and I don't want to go around telling people who've been waiting for this thing for 20 years or whatever. I don't want to oversell it, but I think it's genuinely really good fun.
Really good fun. Fun, open world, silly, exciting game.
You've put the time in though to get really into this now. You said through the day that you are now like properly into this, right? This is one of your things now, right?
I've been Mako-pilled.
Is that the term you settled on for it?
Yeah, I don't know. I've been read 13-pilled.
That does sound more like something they would cook up in a lab, doesn't it? Yeah. Okay, good stuff, Matthew.
That is very exciting. I've got this and Dune, part two, vying for my weekend this weekend. Fucking hell.
It's going to be good. So, yes. Okay.
Worm o'clock.
Yeah, absolutely.
Okay, so we come to my first game of the episode. I've been playing Balatro, which is, or Balatro, people are gonna have a go at me on the Discord about how I've said that wrong, I expect. But basically, a poker-style roguelike that you've probably seen discussed on the internet, a proper sort of like viral hit, I think.
I don't think this game was really on people's radars, and there was a Steam Next Fest demo last month, and then people started talking about it, and then it was reviewed incredibly well. And now I think it's sold really well, and I think people are calling it one of the best games of the year so far. I have to agree, it's incredibly addictive.
Yeah, it's really, really good. Really well-considered roguelike. Does all the things you want a roguelike to do, it gives you those moments where you feel trapped by your own bad decision-making.
It gives you those moments where things pop off because you've made good decisions along the way and really put time into constructing the best build. It's full of drama and excitement. If you don't know how to play poker or it sounds boring to you, I promise you, you will like this.
If you've got any interest in card games or roguelikes, this is just phenomenally well done.
How much poker do you need to know to play this game?
Genuinely zero. When people told me that going into it, I was dubious because I bought it anyway. I was 10 pounds, I thought, okay, yeah, that's fine.
That is well worth a punt, 10 quid. So did that. And then people were like, oh, don't worry about it.
You don't need to do that because of this, this and this. But it is true because you're going along, basically climbing this ladder and you're against different opponents. But the goal is to basically score as many, score a certain number of points to defeat this opponent, quote unquote, and then move on to the next one.
And how points are scored is basically like you playing different poker hands and then you also loading up on these different cards that add multipliers and stuff to make your score pop off. And you're trying to achieve the scoring question within a certain number of turns. You can discard a bunch of cards if you're not happy with your loadout, quote unquote.
And then you basically look at a long list of, it's not that long, but a list of different types of poker hand. If you don't know how to play it, then this will explain what all of the different types are. If you select a bunch of cards in a row and there is a hand you can play with them, the game will tell you, this is the hand you're going to play.
This is the poker move. I don't know anything about cards, sorry. This is the poker hand you're going to play, basically.
And so-
Check out La Shieffre over here.
I just think, but the thing is though, the roguelite elements around the outside, it almost feels like it's tailored around making the limitations of how you can play poker your strategy. So what you can essentially do is, let's say you don't feel confident about doing anything except matching two cards at a time. So you've got two threes, so you play that, right?
And then you see you've got two threes, you've got two sixes, so you play those. And that is a valid poker hand or poker play or whatever. You can play that, you can score points.
And you can essentially, in between games, you can spend money to get these like planet cards, which level up the score, scoring mechanism of a particular type of hand. So you can basically level up the idea of matching two. So matching two will be worth much more than like having five in a row of the same suit, because you have decided to focus your, you know, you've decided to progress this one thing that you actually understand.
And therefore you can build a strategy around the limitations of how you understand poker, which works really well because I just played a game. I got to the very last, the last boss, I guess, the last opponent in a run. I wasn't able to beat the opponent because it's incredibly tough.
But I did that the whole way by having these cards where like match two and match four, I'd leveled up as much as I could. And so I just needed to play those in any given game. And then I could basically progress.
And I didn't have to worry about thinking in a more abstract way about, oh, do I have, oh, I've got five, six, eight and nine, but I need seven. Should I discard these cards to get a seven? You don't have to think about that at all.
You're like, I got two sevens. Fine, I'll play them. You know what I mean?
So-
It's just sort of doubled down and boiled it down to Uno. Yeah.
I guess there's a little bit of that, yeah. But the other interesting wrinkle to it, as well as being able to sort of progress these different types of plays to make them score more, there's another multiplying factor to it, which is you have like a row of like five Joker cards and the Jokers all have different properties. So they will add multipliers, like whether it's like, you know, it could be like 1.5 times, but then it will go all the way up to like 20 times.
And so the more effective Joker cards you get, the better chance you have of progressing because you're able to reach those higher numbers in your play. You go from scoring 300 at the very start of a run to doing 30,000 in like, in one play. And that sort of progress is actually like quite thrilling.
And the Joker cards add loads and loads of strategic depth to it. I had this one card that essentially would level up the multiplier every time I played a pair of cards. So not only had I leveled up how many points I could score from playing two sevens or two ones at the same time, but this Joker card, its multiplier would increase every single time I played two cards and it was a cumulative.
So you're going to the next game with this bonus, like stacking and stacking and stacking. And you get that, you get cards that reward you. Like if you just, every time you play a club, club related card, then it will add a multiplier based on that.
And you basically like, you're building these combinations of these Joker cards in order to like get the perfect run. I've probably explained it terribly there, but it's very, very intuitive. And you very slowly understand how all the different pieces fit together.
But once you do, it's as gross thing as playing something like FTL or Cobot Core last year, one of our favorites, Matthew. It's really fucking good. I'm guessing you've seen this talked about quite a lot.
Yeah, it's absolutely on the, oh, I know I've got to play this and it will inevitably be one of those game of the year contenders. Because the kind of people who are talking about this and waxing lyrical about it are people whose tastes I really respect. And it just feels like, I know it's sort of different, but every year has one of those kind of, you know, just absolutely break out everyone's wild about it and always people can't be wrong.
So yeah, it was the poker element that had me a little nervous. So I'm glad to hear that's not the case. Do you think you'd come out the other end of this with the ability to play poker?
No, I don't think so. I think that in some ways, I think it's calibrated around dummies who don't know what poker, what they're doing with poker. If anything, it's built up a disdain for poker and poker culture for me.
Like, I'm sort of like, I guess it's kind of a blokey thing, like we're having a poker night and I'm playing this and I'm there thinking, I couldn't imagine building a whole night around this one game. It doesn't seem like, they might as well do a Rocket League night.
It's not like, Tony Soprano and all the guys have hired out a hotel suite for an incredibly high-roller game of Rocket League.
Well, I think men seeming quite grown up by having a poker night, and they'll pour some whiskey or whatever, and I'm like, is this grown up?
It's the gambling, right?
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.
And that's part of it. It's every one of those moves supercharged by the threat of losing money.
Yeah, again, you could just gamble on Rocket League, do you know what I mean?
So I sort of like, if anything, I came out of it thinking, oh, that's what poker is? I guess is the whole bluffing element and all this stuff. But I don't know, I wasn't sort of like, I didn't come out of it thinking poker was amazing.
I came out of it thinking, oh, I guess this is just, this is actually like slightly simpler than I realized it was. And then I also believe that poker has been disproportionately well represented by TV and film, because again, it's not that interesting, I don't think. So, and I've always kind of hated those scenes in films and TV shows as well.
It's always an arbitrary way to sort of build tension. I say that, I just watched an episode of Atlanta with an absolutely great, great poker scene where one of the characters was swindled out of money and the guy who lost went to bed to escape this guy. And then like this other character started banging on this glass to get him to like wake up out of bed and pay him his money.
It's very, very good anyway. You really have to be there. But yes.
So we don't see James Bond playing Balatro anytime soon?
No, it's sort of like, but it's, I do sort of think about the idea of like me trying to go to a poker night after playing this and sort of like, you know, there are no Joker multiplayer cards and I'm completely fucked.
I can, in my head, I can hear Sean Connery saying Balatro and it sounds good. Balatro. Coming out of his mouth.
Balatro, yeah, sort of like that, yeah, yeah.
I've just looked at a screenshot of it. This game visually has quite big solitaire on Windows energy.
It does, but the Joker cards are where I think, and some of the other cards you get, like the sort of bonus cards, give you, do differentiate it a bit. Like it's not, that's what I was thinking actually, is this on the cusp of like, oh, my dad might like this and I also like this, which is such a rare Venn diagram of games. But I think the Joker cards have like, there's quite a funny one, for example, where I think it's, it's like one of the stacking ones where if you do the same move in like successive games, it's like, the card is like styled like a loyalty card.
It's got little stamps on it and stuff, like you go to a restaurant or something like that. And it's got things like that, little visual touches, one is like a business card, and it's got like, and it's signed by this, this, you know, the Joker is kind of a character, the Joker is a character who kind of explains the game to you and then sort of exists around the outside of the game as well. So that makes it a bit more un-windows solitaire, you know?
Interesting. Yeah, I'm really up for this. Yeah.
Do you think it's something you could just like, dip into and enjoy, like you don't need to sit down for like hours and hours and hours with it, right?
No, 100% you can dip into this. This is like, you could play a game in about probably 45 minutes, a complete run. It's, and it'll take you less than that to understand it.
It really, it'll get its hooks in you right away. I think that's what's great about it, to be honest, it's just so, such an easy to pick up and play experience. And again, like, you can tailor this around how you want to play it.
So if you don't think you're going to like, put together a fucking Royal Flush or whatever, if that's not your bag, then yeah, just do, just play it like it snapped basically, and it'll be fine. So you might not like, maybe, maybe you do need to like, level up some of the really good sort of poker moves in order to get poker plays. Just again, I'm out of my depth here, in order to like, properly finish the game, because the last boss seemed like disproportionately hard compared to some of the other ones.
But certainly in like, learning it, I don't think it really, it makes you, it doesn't really make you play it in any one particular way. It just sort of like, wants you to take it at your own pace, I think. A really special little thing, definitely get it on Switch, because I got it on Steam Deck and I was kind of like, oh, I wish I could just take this to the train with me on my Switch and play this on the way up to London or whatever.
But now I'm not going to, I feel bereft that this game won't be with me for a few days. It's that good, Matthew. Yeah, another potential top 10 nominee already.
Crossing one of those off this early in the year, that's good for you. You know, that's pressures off.
Exactly. So that's that, Matthew. And yes, I guess those were the two main games we wanted to discuss.
We've got some other bits and pieces. What else have you been playing?
I've played a little bit of Helldivers 2, which has obviously come out sort of exploded and due to its explosion in popularity has been quite hard to play maybe as they intended it due to like server woes. So it's kind of a double edged sword. I mean, sort of thrilled for them that this, you know, quite relatively small, small studio has seen such enormous uptake of their game after, you know, I think we spoke about this before.
The first one is more of kind of like a arcade throw away thing. And this is actually like a, you know, substantial going concern now, which is awesome for them. But also, it's kind of hammered it and, you know, there are frustrations from people who would like to be playing more of it.
I have finally managed to put a chunk of time into it over the weekend. Have you played any of this tool?
Have you like been following this tool? I got it on PC. Jay accidentally deleted it from his PS5 when he went to update it.
And we didn't play it. So I played half of the tutorial and here I am now, you know, that's a great epic story of one man's triumph over nothing at all. Yeah, great times.
Awesome. I think what I like about it is it seems very kind of pick up and play, you do this little 10 minute tutorial, which explains the basics. It's a third person, over the shoulder co-op sort of running gun game where you're given these brief little missions, very sort of snacky size, 10 minute, 15 minute, you drop down to planet surfaces in these drop pods.
Then you run over to an objective, which is like tinker with this computer or power down this thing. So lots of variations on interacting with a computer while waves of either Starship Troopers style bugs or kind of Terminator style cyborg men or these sort of robot-y guys sort of swarm at you and you fight them off, ideally with a team of four. But on top of this quite basic premise, it has all this sort of playful shit, mainly these stratagems, which are kind of air drops that you call into battle, you sort of input this almost like cheat code to program in what stratagem you want.
So all this shit's kicking off and you're trying to go go up, down, left, right. So it has this sort of fun panicked element to it. But then you drop these stratagems and like giant space lasers rain down or maybe you drop in kind of more ammo or maybe you drop in reinforcements, which brings your dead teammates back to life.
So you're constantly kind of raining stuff down from the sky. That's a huge part of the appeal, just because you've got these amazingly overpowered toys kind of just in reach, but also slightly fuzzy around the edges. You know, when you throw them, maybe the enemies will have moved on.
There is a little delay and trying to kind of second guess people's positions and make sure you efficiently use these very dangerous toys. That's a sort of constant thing, which is always fun. And the second thing is friendly fire is always on.
So it's sort of designed for you to kind of accidentally kill your friends, either with like friendly fires, you're strafing away, or that you drop these giant things on them. And, you know, they really know what they're doing in terms of everything has like a, like a little bit of a sting in the tail. And again, like people have likened this to the kind of sort of satirical edge of sort of Starship Troopers, which is definitely a big part of this game's DNA, but they've somehow sort of found the gameplay equivalent of that kind of chaos and messiness and the sort of throwaway nature of these soldiers lives in that they all get mulched, you know, things can get crushed by the drop pods, which are bringing down aid that you then hope to give to other people and things like that.
So you're constantly kind of laughing. It's never sort of, it doesn't feel like any of it is so substantial or so serious that a death kind of matters as much. You know, it doesn't feel like, oh, we were just doing an hour long run of a Left 4 Dead campaign and now we've all died and we've got to reset it.
Like the stakes feel sort of deliberately throw away, which I think enables you to kind of enjoy the deliberate sloppiness baked into a lot of its ideas. You just go in there, you know, play a couple of rounds. It doesn't feel like there's masses of expertise.
Maybe people who've played like 20 hours will say, actually, there's all these subtleties to it. But whether you kind of win or fail, it still feels like you've had a good time. You know, obviously, it's good to win and it's good to kind of fight off massive waves of bugs as they're all kind of swarming on you and it gives you those kind of desperate last stands, particularly when you're extracting, kind of locks you in a single location and then, you know, everything descends on you as you try to kind of hold off the landing pad.
And I think my favorite thing about it is actually is when you when you call for the extraction, it plays this awesome bit of music, which is just feels like a crazy Mission Impossible theme tune, like these drums start kicking in and then this big brass comes in and you're suddenly like, yes, we're going to fucking do it. We just got to stay alive for two minutes. This is rad.
And it's like a game where just a hundred small sort of smart decisions have just added up to something which is just hugely, hugely fun and doesn't feel like you have to commit to it forever. It really, if anything, I think it feels stronger to me when you do only play it for like half an hour or an hour. You know, I can't really imagine a four-hour session of this.
So it kind of maintains that arcadey, slightly more kind of popcorn kind of thing of the original game and other games of that ilk, but just has the kind of AAA production value. So it looks amazing and, you know, has always great physics and always hilarious ragdolling and a really interesting experiment in pumping, you know, more money, more energy and effort into an idea which could very easily be just a repeat of the first one, this top-down twin stick shooter type thing. So yeah, like really compelling.
I'm like so happy for them, like what a cool thing to have sort of exploded in this way. And it was a weird one because I felt like we weren't like inside of it, but we were obviously like covering it at work and looking at it in previews and stuff. And then all of a sudden just it just spiked in popularity.
Like, you know, we saw the phenomenon firsthand, but I still couldn't point out like what it was that made this the game, you know, made this the one which is going to be the flavor of the moment. Yeah, just maybe it feels more PC in nature. Maybe I don't know.
It's a weird one.
It was I think it was partly that PlayStation showcase trailer that went out. Like it just looked really good in that it had loads and loads of maps, loads of action going on, just looked really fun. I think that that's sort of like just I think it was kind of on people's radars and that just made it look super, super cool.
Yeah. And then I think it just sort of snowballed from there. But it has been has been gradual.
It's like sold. I think each week it's been on sale in the UK, like physical versions been selling like more and more copies. And, you know, it's obviously success on Steam is self evident.
It's monsterously huge, has apparently sold more than three million copies already. Like it's, yeah, a proper unexpected success.
So, good for them and yeah, yeah, great for them and interested to see what the kind of repercussions are for, you know, the wave of other online first party games, you know, of which this was sort of the quiet shadow drop of that whole thing. You know, that, you know, this is their, you know, the first of all those live service games that they're meant to be making and working on. So, does that like embolden them or is it actually just this very specific game and they understand that, you know, fascinating stuff.
Yeah, first step on Matthew becoming a big marathon head that will coming soon 2025. So look forward to that. But yeah, it's a funny thing as well where Suicide Squad, there was so much live service game discourse and then, and then I think people just like, no, I don't want anything like this anymore, and then like, literally a week later, this came along and people were like, Oh, I really dig this.
And, you know, I think the truth is that people always have room in their hearts for these things when it just pushes a button that they didn't know they wanted pushed. And I think that the very particular style of multiplayer experience they've gone for here just means that, you know, the comparisons is big anger to like Earth Defense Force and stuff like that, right? It's, it's that kind of like, you know, it's very kind of like moreish and silly.
And it's not just about being sniped by teenagers. It's like, it's, you know, and it's not necessarily about ticking off box on a battle pass. I think it's just a fundamental, you know, we're scratching this edge that you didn't even know.
You didn't even know that this was something you wanted. And here it is in such a complete form. So yeah, good for them.
Yeah, it's almost like everything you get through the battle pass or everything where you have to dig a little deeper, it adds subtleties, but never like the main event. If everything in this game that's spectacular, like the biggest weapons, like the maddest stuff comes fitted as standard. And then if you want to like grind for medals to unlock specific armors or whatever, like they're actually quite throw away.
I wouldn't say they're bad or anything. They are so sort of not key to what makes this game work. Like I honestly believe your initial loadout is everything you'd ever need to have a good time with this game.
And maybe that's the secret to it. It just works and is big fun out of the box, so you don't really care about what else is there.
Yeah. Okay. Good stuff.
Well, I've got a copy. I'll play it and I will come back with thoughts at some point as well, Matthew. Because we should play.
We should play some online together.
We always say that about games, so they never do.
Get me in with Jay Bayless.
We just never really are able to make it work though, do you know what I mean? Like it sort of, or, you know, neither of us follow up afterwards. What was the last thing we talked about?
Don't you want to hear me screaming piss as I get eaten by a giant bug?
Always. That's a great time if you ask me, but it's just never quite happened on the practicality front. I don't know.
You've always got like a 60-hour JRPG to be playing, you know what I mean? Although you are exiting that tunnel now. Do you know what you'll do with your life after FF7 Rebirth is done?
I don't know. I'm kind of eyeing up that, whatever that game with Unicorn in the title is.
Oh, Unicorn Overlord. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's, it's, which is just like one week after FF7 Rebirth. So yeah, nice.
I look forward to you becoming a big vanilla wear head next, Matthew. I think that's on the cards for you this year. Okay.
Last game I'm going to talk about this episode then is Tomb Raider. So I've been playing the remastered trilogy they put out. I've never ever played Tomb Raider 1, the original.
I played a bit of Tomb Raider 2. I had borrowed it from a friend for about a year and a half or something. I think I only ever got as far as the Venice levels and that.
Got out of that big hole you start in. Found the jumping incredibly tricky because I was playing on PC. We didn't have a gamepad so I was trying to play it with a flight stick because that's what we had.
Oh my God. That's the true Bruce Wayne trying to get out of the pit version of the game.
Exactly. Yeah. So yeah, I did that and I thought it was significant at the time.
I remember going around a mate's house and doing the whole going around the mansion thing. It was obviously a very key part of the 90s gaming landscape and the rise of 3D games. And I fully copped to the fact that it's probably the most egregious game missing or series missing from the PS1 draft we just did, Matthew.
You don't think Tomb Raider should be missed?
No, don't bow to that.
Only that one. I'm not getting into the, I'm very disappointed you didn't talk about Tomba. That guy was, you know, I don't think that I necessarily agree with, but yeah.
So yeah, so I hadn't played it before and played the entire first section of the game. This remaster I think is quite nice because it's not like remake level production values, but neither is it an insignificant sort of spruce up. So what they've basically done is retain the overall style of the game, but improve like the character models and the textures and the environments, but it kind of looks like PS3 era quality.
Well, it's sort of like some things look PS3 quality, some things look more sort of like modern looking, but I think it's just quite a tastefully done art lift basically. And at the same time, you can just tap a button at any time and you can see the old art style, which is a really nice touch. And they've kept the original tank controls as well.
They've added some modern control scheme, which I've not tried. I've only played it with the tank controls. And it is like refreshingly obtuse.
It is like, because they just none of the, because like Tomb Raider is basically a contemporary of Mario 64, right? They just hadn't figured out how to do this stuff in 1996 yet. So it's so comically precise in, like if you have to be stood at the end of a pillar and jump at a certain point in order to reach the next pillar, or you have to do like a running jump sometimes and so you'll do these very gradual stepping back in order to get the right run up.
But I quite like that, like the, the platforming and the, it kind of is, is a puzzle in itself. And I think as someone who is, you know, is more used to playing games like, well not exclusively, because I was playing games in the 90s as well, but you know, playing the likes of Uncharted and seeing those games celebrated so much when the platforming was never really challenging in those games at most, you know, you, you had to sort of like leap onto a ledge before a rock collapsed and, and you died and, you know, I find those games very enjoyable, but it's nice to play these games that are like, no, you just have to be able to do this. If you can't do this, you can't fucking progress.
So get used to it. I just, being confronted with that, I've very much enjoyed. But the other thing I like about it is the horror game vibes of it.
It's strangely spooky and scary. So I didn't realize that the T-Rex encounter is the most famous set piece from that original set of games, probably, right? It's sort of like, it's one of those gaming moments that people talked about afterwards.
I was aware of it. I didn't realize how early it would come in the game, nor did I realize that in the original graphics settings, you are fighting it under this black sky. And it really is quite spooky to just see it emerge in the distance and then just charge towards you.
And like, you just look up and it's like, it's nighttime, but there's nothing but pitch black there. And it's probably because they can't have a T-Rex on screen and have a fucking sky because it was the PS1. So, you know, that was probably why it is the way it is.
But yeah, did you ever get that vibe from the original Tomb Raiders, Matthew? That sort of weird thing of like the limitations making it maybe scarier than the developers intended it to be?
Yeah, definitely. You know, going back and rewatching some of them. I mean, when I played Anniversary, I remember, you know, watching videos of earlier bits of it just to see, you know, how much they changed.
And I love Anniversary and it puts a much more like accessible sort of modern face on the game. But something is definitely lost in how well lit it is and just the clarity of what each space is going for. Like this strange sort of knobbly sort of unknowableness to the original games, especially with the original graphics.
You know, the strange kind of textures of bending in weird ways. Some of it looks like a sort of magic eye picture, which adds a sort of weirdness to it. You know, you just can't really put your finger on any of it.
I like to think some of it was deliberate, given like the idea is that you are going into these threatening, spooky places.
Yeah.
Admittedly, like the dinosaur against the black sky is probably just a tech limitation, rather than like, you know, they were trying to go from some Silent Hill stuff or whatever.
Well, very different type of horror, but you know, yeah, it's sort of...
Yeah, but it is, yeah, there is something quite cursed and lonely about those games by design, so it can only further fuel that.
Yeah, it's also got this just lack of restraint to it that you just don't see in modern games. In the fact that you go from fighting dogs, like in, or wolves and bats in like caves, to like, a velociraptor turns up and they never explain why that's there. And then after that, you know, like a moment later, you're fighting the T-Rex.
And then after that, you're in a tomb and then like a mummy comes to life. And like, it never stops to be like, oh, this is happening because of this. And, oh, no, you've unleashed the this and this is happening.
It's just like, it feels like people in Derby 25 years ago or whatever, longer than that, almost 30 years ago being like, oh, it'd be cool if there were some velociraptors here. You know what I mean? Like it honestly feels like that is the intent behind some of the decisions making it.
And so I really respect that and really enjoy it. And I think it's cool that they've gone out of their way to preserve these games as they were. Because it is a sort of, when you think about the fact they did anniversary, it is quite an odd project, isn't it?
To be like, we're going to do the originals as they were, but then there's an optional graphical spruce up if you want it. Yeah, it's quite unusual. But I think that's the kind of thing that people are after more now.
That kind of preservation.
It's weird reading the reviews around these games or just hearing some of the discussion where I do come away thinking, you know, am I a bit basic bitch for liking anniversary as much as I do? Because I really like that that Crystal Dynamics kind of generation of them, you know, legend and underworld and anniversary. But so many people have such a deep attachment to the specific oddness of the controls and the visuals that I wonder like, am I a fake fan?
Do I not actually get what is good about Tomb Raider that I prefer these slightly more sanded down versions?
Well, there's room for both. That's the thing, right? And like these just haven't been at the center of games for so, so long.
So the fact they are now just very easily available on a wide range of formats is cool. And, you know, that's the thing. If you've got an Xbox, you can play both Crystal Dynamics trilogies and this trilogy.
That's like a massive stack of games. It's like the complete Lara Croft history is basically like, you know, easy to access, you know, that's and that's cool. And, yeah, I think it's it's nice to revisit these as well, because I think that it just ended.
So in such on such a sour note with Angel of Darkness, people just so down on that game. Yeah, just sort of like it kind of killed the series dead for like, you know, years and years. Yeah, about three years at the time or four years, something like that, which is a long time.
And, you know, at that point, that was a long time for a series to go away, I think. But yeah, now it's I don't know. I don't really know where people stand with Tomb Raider now.
Like, I don't know if people can really decide which version of it they think they like the most. But this feels like the one that's got the most, like, yeah, the most reverence attached to it, I guess. So I get you, though, Matthew.
I think that I like the slickness of playing an Uncharted or, you know, all the more recent ones. That is something I absolutely want for my games. But I think it's something that is just completely counter to where this kind of action-adventure experience landed, ended up.
It's very odd making the leap from, like, Lara in the pop culture landscape. And, you know, that she became this kind of quite sort of silly, sexy icon for all of gaming. And the gulf between that and these quite strange platformer games that she was actually in.
The idea of seeing kind of like a sexy Lara on the front of a Ladsmag and then going and playing a game where you have to very, very delicately line up on all these platforms to get through some Peruvian tomb. And you're like, what? This isn't sexy at all.
This is really difficult and weird. Why is there a T-Rex in front of a void? You promised me sexiness, not the void.
It's that thing of that attractive woman you saw on the back of FHM just got eaten by wolves. It's almost like the construction of Lara Croft is as much of a marketing entity as it is about the character as she's presented in the game. So yeah, those things are quite far apart for sure, and they always have been.
But yeah, it's cool to just have them in this form. I just never thought I'd play these, and I did a kind of Pass the Pad thing with it with a friend. It was a really great way to just ingest this vision of what 3D platforming might be from the perspective of people in the mid-90s.
Good stuff. So I'm glad they did that, Matthew. Yeah.
I hope it inspires a new generation of horny teenage boys to try and make or take her clothes off by jumping into the swimming pool three times or whatever it was.
I somehow don't think that's going to stick, but that's just a shameful indictment of where we're at in terms of free pornography.
Real heads do the new cheat in the original graphics.
Yeah, in front of the butler. Yes. Good stuff, Matthew.
So that's this episode done on a very strange note as ever. Slightly shorter one, but I think getting a nice little taste of your rebirth views there is an exciting note to go away with. It certainly is for me because I'm pleased I'm going to get to grips with it this weekend.
That's very exciting.
This is where you're like, oh, overrated shit. You were completely wrong and I feel terrible.
Now, I'm very open minded with Final Fantasy. I'm always like, I always want to love whatever they've made. You know what I mean?
That's how I go into all of those games. And that has not changed. So yeah, I can't wait to get my hands on it.
So Matthew, where can people find you on social media?
I am MrBazzle UnderscorePesto on Twitter and on Blue Sky I'm MrBazzlePestoNo Underscore.
Are you still cranking out that Blue Sky content? Is there a lot of that going on?
I don't think so. I think I've posted three times on that. Have I posted there this year?
I don't think so. I think one of them was the Borgon tweet again.
Yeah, one of them was the Blorko tweet again. Like it's just... You're playing all the hits.
That's what the crowd are yelling.
You've got to put the magnifying glass chandelier on there next. That's your other hand. Do you see people talking about it online, Matthew?
They're trying to work out the deal with the magnifying glass. That really cracked me up. People have taken it upon themselves to work out what the hell is going on with your brother's chandelier.
That's just great stuff.
I like it when I see people talking about what they imagined the chandelier was going to be before they looked at the picture. I really haven't mis-sold it. It's everything I've told you it's going to be.
But people can't quite picture the magnifying glasses. That's the magic bit for me.
Yeah, it's good stuff. So go check that out. No doubt it will come up again at some point, the chandelier.
So yes, thank you so much for listening. Backpage Pod on Twitter and Bluesky. And also I'm Samuel W.
