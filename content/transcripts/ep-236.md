Hello, and welcome to The Back Page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Hello, Matthew. We're joined by a returning special guest for the first time in three years. It's Jen Simpkins.
Lovely to have you here.
I was like, it's me. I'm very late. Three years late.
I've been busy, but I'm so glad to be back. Thank you for having me on.
Yeah, absolutely. I feel like when we had you on first time, it was the tail end of the pandemic. It feels like such a different era you were on last time.
I'm really excited to have you here. How are things going? Obviously, it's a games industry in 2025, so whenever you feel like sharing, by all means.
But how's it going?
Yeah. I mean, what was it Ronan Keaton said? Life is a roller coaster.
Just got to ride it. I've been really busy writing a game for a while, but I'm wrapping up on that project now. I had an amazing time with it and worked with such cool people.
But yeah, like you said, it's the game industry. And so we're wrapping that one up now, which is a little bit sad, but I'm really excited to get into kind of whatever my next thing is going to be. Yeah, like even though it's kind of been all over the place, I'm still feeling really, really positive and like inspired by games and stuff.
Like more than ever, which kind of doesn't track for kind of like the up and downs that are going on. But I don't know, I think I'm just playing some good games recently and enjoy still really thinking about games and writing games. So kind of in between places right now and think about what I want to do next in games and catching up with with friends like you for the first time in ages out of my cave.
It's awesome to have you back. And yeah, I don't know if you see this way, but I'm a bit church and state about the industry being on fire and the games as I enjoy them, I do. I am able to isolate those things in my head.
You know, I don't know if you find that's the case as well.
Yeah, it's exactly the same. And like, and it's not just the game industry, right? It's kind of like tech as a whole is kind of on fire and in a weird state.
And yeah, I still kind of like sometimes it just doesn't even feel connected when you're kind of playing the art that continues to come out. I feel like I'm finding good art in like all sorts of different places now around games and stuff like that. So yeah, lots of reasons to still be kind of in it and hopeful, which is nice, despite what you might see online all the time.
It's like there's misery, but there's also so much good stuff if you kind of just like log off a second and go out and go to some festivals and play some things. So yeah, I'm glad I can kind of hold on to that love of it.
Oh yeah, big the horrors persist, but so do I vibes basically. Yeah, so I mean, I'd love to ask about some of the things you've been doing lately. I know you've been doing a bit of games writing again, writing about games in the past year or so.
How did that come about and what did that entail?
Yeah, so I was kind of, it's like during my last project actually, like, you know, we kind of had the freedom to do some things for friends as well. That's kind of inevitably how I get into it is like a friend has a cool idea and they're like, Jen, would you write something? And I'm like, yeah.
So, so this On Games Journal kind of kicked off last year, which kind of the former art editor of Edge, Andrew Hind, that was like his big kind of book magazine hybrid publication project, he's calling it, and so he called me up about that and was like, oh, would you kind of write something to help kick it off? If people haven't heard of it, like a kind of compendium of seven writers kind of given a huge word count and a nice long deadline to kind of write about whatever they're excited about. Yeah.
And so I was super, super excited when Andrew came to me and was just like, what would be like your dream feature? What do you want to talk about right now? So I chose dress up for that.
So yeah, that was for the first edition, which was amazing. I was super happy to be part of that. And then the second one's just come out like this week as well.
I think it's coming with people. And I managed to hop in and I was actually covering a topic that Keza had pitched, but couldn't end up doing about rhythm games. So I've written a big piece about kind of rhythm games and their connections to like human nature and why they're such a compelling game genre, basically.
Which was really fun. So yeah, so it was that. And then I wrote a piece, friend of the podcast, I believe, Kaz Whistler, he came on, right?
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah. To talk about a firm waste of time. And I'd never written for the MAG and I'd always, you know, kind of look to it as a real kind of favourite example of independent kind of print games media.
So Kaz came along and was like, would you kind of write a feature about the weirdest kind of controllers in games? He obviously knows me very well. So I got to kind of go on about the Game Boy cameras, like peripherals and controllers.
So it's like the Denture to Go train controller, the Wii bowling ball, which is a bit of a duff one, which was great. So I enjoyed giving that a bit of a shooing, but mostly like very, very complimentary and celebratory stuff about these weird ass controllers and peripherals. Yeah, and then kind of the last place I've been helping out at is Lost in Cult, who Chris Schilling's editorial kind of director there, right, at the moment.
And Chris was like, oh, we're going to do a special edition essentially for Immortality, the Sam Barlow kind of horror FNV game. Yeah. And Chris was like, oh, we're doing these amazing kind of lavish special editions, really beautiful.
I believe it's Immortality, and thank goodness you're here, and Excavation of Hobbs Barrow. Yeah, which I still haven't played. I need to play that one.
Yeah. So I kind of jumped on that as well and did some of the introductory essays basically. So I did my own kind of little essay about the idea of control in Immortality.
And then I also got to interview Harlotta Moulin, who plays a very important character in Immortality. And we just had actually like a really kind of emotional conversation about like that kind of theme of control and her experience acting for the game. And yeah, we had a grand old time.
So it's been amazing. So, you know, shout out to all my friends keeping me in rent money while everything's crazy. I've just been like having the best time.
It's been it's been fun.
That's awesome. I was curious if you found because I found this after having three years off writing anything for, you know, publications, going back and writing one review for PC Gamer almost killed me. I mean, I wrote about Dynasty Warriors, very different to what you were doing.
But I was curious if you found that readjusting to that headspace was challenging at all.
Yeah, a little bit. On one hand, yes, on the other hand, no. I think it's like the volume of what you have to write, because I just, you know, I've recently been writing a lot of, you know, game dialogue and things like that.
It's very short kind of box a lot of the time, and it's about making things kind of as short and as effective as possible. So it's not to get into in the way of the game a lot of the time and just support it. And then Andrew came along and was like, Oh, will you write 4,500 words?
And I was like, Oh, shit. So, yeah, I definitely I definitely was like, Oh, yeah, the kind of moving up to that scale again was a bit mad. And, yeah, shout out to Nathan Brown, who was editing that first kind of on issue, because he really helped me kind of, I was definitely structure wise, kind of felt like I was flailing around a bit when it came to structuring.
But the actual kind of the the content of it, I was like, Oh, I feel really, really sure on what I want to say and really enjoyed saying that and kind of felt, felt really comfortable in that. But yeah, it was the structuring for me of like a really long feature. I definitely forgotten some of that.
Was it similar for you? Was it like a structured thing? Was it like a, I don't know if I have opinions anymore thing?
What was it?
Well, structure, I kind of actually know because the way I always structure articles is it's a series of about nine floating paragraphs that eventually sort of broken down into about 15 paragraphs and then rearranged in different orders. It's like a mad kind of puzzle game is how I edit. Probably not too unusual for people who write about video games, but it was the pedantic nature of rereading it and redrafting and every single line being like that could be a bit sharper.
That could be a bit more original and feeling like I had something to prove to myself. Like I can't phone this in. This has to be treated like it's a fucking Elvis's comeback in Hawaii or something, which is ridiculous.
You know, just the weight gain aside, there are no parallels really with that situation. And so, yeah, but it's that thing of like just scrutinising every word and being like, oh, was it always like this? And I just forgot, and I think the answer was it was, you know?
Yeah, the neurosis remains fully. Yeah. Honestly, though, like when, you know, hearing you talk about it as well, it's like, it's not really much different from the way that like writing video game dialogue works.
Like you have to get really kind of particular about it. And it's also that kind of structural puzzle you're talking about, right, where you kind of have all these ideas and then you're like, oh, how do, if this fires in any order, like, you know, how do I make sure it makes sense in every order and how can I get across an idea? How can I make this as functional as possible while also being like actually entertaining or funny?
Like it also has to be informative in the shortest amount of time possible. So yeah, there's some parallels there. Who knows?
Maybe you should come write some some dialogue for video games. See how it compares. Yeah, there's similarities there.
Oh, I'd love to give it a go. I mean, I wrote dialogue for Matthew, you know, for our 200th episode.
Right.
It was basically a mockumentary about us having a falling out. And so I did have to, I did spend months getting into the Matthew Castle headspace, which was, you know, it was actually like a fun character to inhabit, I would say, but that's as close as I've got.
Oh, I was going to say like, how do you go method, you know, with the character of Matthew Castle?
He just bumps into me in the street and I'm dressed exactly the same as him basically, and yeah, just living his life. Yeah, that's awesome, Jen. You give a lot of the kind of rich scene of premium print products, you know, that's kind of going down right now, like a nice shout out there.
There's a lot happening in that space. So it's cool they're able to grab you at these moments and get some more of your words down about games. So yeah, people can go check those out.
That's super cool. You picked the subject of this episode. You described dress up in video games as one of your hyper fixations.
That was your word, not mine. I like the idea of us talking about something that takes us outside of our comfort zone. And you know this area, this is an area of interest to you.
So why this idea for an episode?
I hope you're not regretting it now. I'm about to make you regret it. It's going to be fun.
But yeah, basically, so I kind of mentioned on Games Journal, right? And Andrew saying, what would you kind of ideally write about? And I just started to think about mainly because a game called Infinity Nikki was kind of due to come out at the December last year.
And I'm very excited about it as someone who's played a bunch of these kind of mobile dress up games called the Love Nikki kind of series. They're super big in China in particular. Incredibly successful kind of mobile dress up games worldwide with kind of a really interesting, like super dramatic narrative all about this kind of world where like fashion is political power.
So I was really excited for that next game. And then like, I kind of just got thinking for this this on feature. I was like, I feel like I've not played a lot of dress up games that aren't entirely kind of superficial, which is fine, because like clothes definitely can be superficial.
But when I was thinking about the Nikki games and I was thinking about like, I don't know, like my own experiences in life with kind of, you know, dressing up in particular ways for certain things, it's like you go to a job interview and you might put on a smart shirt. So you kind of give off the right impression or I talk about in the feature in the end about the day I was adopted and my parents were very careful. My would be parents, spoilers, they got me.
But yeah, they dressed me up like really nicely, right, to go to court. And it was kind of about, I didn't realise it at the time, but it's kind of about showing that you are capable of taking care of this child, right? And making sure that they're dressed nicely and they're clean and they're happy.
And I just started thinking a lot about the kind of performance of dressing up and wearing certain things and the function of uniforms and stuff like that. And then I was like, I'm not sure I can think of many games, particularly as well, many indie games, I would expect it to see in the indie scene, that really kind of dig into what wearing clothes and particular clothes or outfits are actually about socially. Like dress up is really socially complex, right?
It's what you're wearing and what you look like, kind of immediately says something about who you are, who you want to be seen as, what you believe, like how much power you have. And I was like, there's got to be some like cool as Indie game out there that's doing this. And there are a couple I found, but it turns out there's not many.
I kind of get into it in the on feature, and I end up talking to some other kind of Indie devs about it. Basically going around and bullying all my Indie dev friends for being like, why haven't you made a game about this yet?
You're into fashion.
And it was really interesting hearing some of the answers. It was like, okay, well, there's kind of a bit of a reputation around kind of dress up games as, you know, it's a superficial topic to kind of talk about. And like, does it really have any meaning?
It's kind of seen as like a girly game genre. And, you know, despite us being in 2025, like there's still some kind of stigma around making games that might be just for young girls. Yeah, there's kind of all sorts of reasons, like there's technical ones as well, the complexity of kind of rendering fabrics and things like that, and having them interact with each other.
And we just kind of discovered together that there's kind of all sorts of reasons why maybe we're not getting games that kind of approach dress up as kind of the more mechanically interesting and socially interesting thing that it is, which is a really niche topic. But it hit, you know, 4,500 words. So, yeah, I don't know.
Like, I'm interested to kind of like hear your guys' thoughts on like whether you've played any dress up games or whether you've kind of ever like thought about that sort of topic or whether it's something that like, obviously, you're two giant blokes. Like, you know, maybe it's something that's that kind of doesn't cross your mind, right? Whereas it's something that I think about every day because I really kind of enjoy showing who I am through dressing up.
Well, when I hear the words dress up, I think of two words, Matthew Castle. And with that in mind, Matthew, I mean, I think that Hitman kind of comes to mind, like particularly when you're talking that I thought about the Paris level in Hitman, where you dress up as a runway model. And that's like the, you know, you're always dressing up in those games, but that is a particular, that's probably the most that the, you know, the attention is drawn to exactly how you're dressed.
And otherwise, I can't really think of it. And I think that's maybe because sometimes maybe for character designers is a case of, right, I've nailed this costume, time to move on to the next one, to the next character model, basically. So no one thinks about having a sequence in Devil May Cry 5, where Dante is wearing a tuxedo, for example.
It's a bit more like, you know, Dante always wears a red leather jacket. We've nailed that design. Let's move on.
So, yeah, Matthew, I was curious to know what you made of this topic. And if you had any thoughts on what Jen just mentioned.
Yeah, I mean, when you said it, I thought, oh, that feels a bit different for us. That would be interesting. I had read Jen's piece in On.
You know, I have sort of an idea of the kind of games you're talking about. I don't think I've played any of them. Well, I've played a tiny bit of...
There was the Nintendo one on DS where you ran a shop.
Style Boutique.
Style Boutique.
Genuinely, genuinely good one.
Oh, that is classified as good. Because there was a bit where you said you played it for a couple of hours and I thought, oh dear, did it like do something wrong?
Oh, that's the one. That's the Switch one that came out, which is Fashion Dreamer, which like I don't know if it was Science of Europe. Maybe it was, but that was the Switch one that came out that was like straight ass.
It's just so bad. It's like, oh, what if a fashion metaverse and you're an influencer and you're out to get likes? And it's just like so soulless compared to the DS ones.
You're talking about where there's that really kind of compelling shop management, stock management mechanics where you're trying to keep all sorts of different styles and stock for different clientele. And then the characters that are in it are just like kind of amazing and like sort of unhinged sometimes. There's like little side stories like this one girl who comes in and she's always kind of, she's basically like single white female-ing this other girl.
She's always trying to like dress up in the exact same stuff as you've sold to this other girl and it's like kind of delightfully like creepy and funny. And that was kind of the stuff that really got me hooked on like this idea of dress up games early. That feels to me like an example of like a girly game, right?
With like real substance, whereas a lot of them from that DS era were like very superficial to the point where you're like, this is kind of a little bit insulting. But yeah, style fatigue. So you played some of the DS one then?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, a long time ago, only because it was, you know, exploding and becoming quite massive and out of curiosity.
I mean, when I say I played some, like we're talking about like an hour on, probably on an R4 cart or something, you know, it's like I wasn't, you know.
An experimental toe dip into the world of Lolita fashion. Yeah.
I must underline, I did not buy Style Boutique. That's not part of the Castle brand. What I did think was interesting and you know, maybe we'll get into this in some of the other questions.
In your article, you talked about the kind of tension between fashion being able to just exist for the sake of existing and being fashion and then the need for a game to have like a system or a mechanic or something to kind of push you forward. And maybe I felt like what you were looking for was, you know, maybe didn't currently exist or already exist where, you know, something that kind of tapped into what fashion allows you to express about yourself. Because even style beauty, because I think a lot of people could just play that as a compulsive, like shop management game, rather than having any deep thoughts about the clothes they're selling.
It's just, you know, it's a stock, isn't it?
Yeah, it doesn't go further than like, oh, this girl's come in and she said she's she's going on like a picnic kind of outing. So she wants a nice dress. But it's like, oh, wouldn't it be much more interesting if like, you know, there's like a kind of like a social need that her outfit needs to fill or something like that.
I feel like there's other games that have kind of maybe explored that a little bit as mini games and stuff. But yeah, I think my main kind of shock was like, oh, there's no narrative games like in this era of kind of LGBT like youth and stuff like that. There's not a lot of games that kind of talk about what you're doing when you pierce your nose or like dye your hair or, you know, kind of the risks you take putting on kind of certain fashion or yeah, also.
And this stuff goes back forever, right? It's like you talk about like the handkerchief code with like gay men, you know, to kind of signal kind of what they're looking for when they're like cruising and things like that. And kind of nowadays it's like if you're a gay woman, like if you wear a carabiner, it's kind of this like nod to other women that like, hey, like, I'm into girls.
As in a climbing, like a climbing.
Yeah, like a climbing carabiner. Do you not know this?
No.
Really? Why am I shocked? Why am I shocked?
Yeah, this is a thing like, like a carabiner is like kind of an iconic lesbian symbol now. Really? Yeah, so often you see a girl.
I just assumed all those ladies really liked abseiling.
You just... Abseiling's never been more back, baby. I mean, they're probably also abseiling is the thing.
I think the Venn diagram of lesbians and abseilers is, you know, regenerates. But yeah, that's like one of the ways that you kind of signal to people that you're like, oh, hey, like, you know, here's a fact about me. What you might want to know if you want to ask me on a date.
Like, I kind of mentioned this in the intro to my own thing. But like, I got a septum piercing because like, a lot of people would assume I was straight. And like, if you're like, trying to kind of meet women, maybe, it's like, it's kind of sometimes, not always, but as a signal of kind of being part of that clan.
And so like, when you start thinking about it in the real world, right, you're like, wow, there's so many kind of layers to this that some people don't even know. Right. But a lot of the time, kind of what we wear and how we look, we're kind of trying to communicate with other humans.
And I think it's really interesting. And like Sam, you brought up Hitman, right? And it's like, that's an example of a game where it's like, okay, dressing up as other people gives you a new kind of social power, where if you dress up as like the janitor, right?
Like suddenly you're allowed to go backstage, like, and nobody really questions it. And there's like scams people do all the time in the real world, right? Well, they put on a high vis vest and everyone just assumes that they're the parking attendant and you give them money.
Like, it's kind of amazing, like how much power this stuff can offer. And Hitman is really good at kind of interrogating that and also making fun of it. And also, yeah, all sorts of fun things, you know, it's kind of a bit of a poke at it, but it's also like very serious where it's like, this is kind of social engineering through what you're wearing.
Yeah. So maybe one of those games that kind of accidentally or even not accidentally kind of kind of deals with that. There's a couple of examples that I think I find in the piece and I end up talking to the developers, but mostly it's like, it feels like we've been robbed of kind of dress up, becoming a bit of a more of an avenue into exploring some of these kind of deeper, more interesting, like social ideas and narratives, right?
I felt like we missed out on that a bit.
Oh, that's super interesting. I mean, yeah, definitely, you know, fairly far from anything we talked about in the podcast before. So, excited to get into it in more detail.
And I really want to read that on piece now. That sounds awesome, Jen. What started your fascination with this subject?
Did any particular games kick it off? We talked about Star Boutique there, but does it go further back than that for you, Jen?
Definitely, yeah. Like Star Boutique, I kind of made a note to mention that, because that definitely as a DS head, as a young warthog, that was definitely my jam. But before that, it was probably Animal Crossing Wild World, right?
And I think Animal Crossing is really interesting about kind of fashion and character customization and the clothes you put on, the hairstyles you get. It was the hair kind of salon in Wild World that I was really kind of challenged by as a kid. Because if you went and got enough hairstyles from Harriet the Poodle, I was playing a girl character.
And after you get a certain number of haircuts, she starts, Harriet the Poodle starts going, oh, you seem like you might also suit like a boy's haircut if you want. Like, how do you feel about that? And that was, for me, probably the first time I'd played a game that kind of allowed you to, or floated that idea.
You know, and I was a little girl with long hair, and I'd always felt like a girl. And, you know, that's not changed for me. But it was like one of the first kind of early examples I had of, oh, you could get a boy's haircut and like, that's allowed, you know?
And like, I couldn't, I was too young to be like, oh, yeah, I could just chop all my hair off to experiment as a kid because my parents would have killed me. And I'm sure some people do. They're braver than I would be.
But like in Animal Crossing, I could be like, oh, I'm going to get like a boy's haircut and I'm going to dye it like lime green. Right. And that was, look, I must have been, yeah, probably like 10 or something when I got a DS light, maybe 9 or 10.
And that was really interesting. There's quite a few moments in Animal Crossing where they kind of let you kind of mess around and blur gender lines a little bit. Some things it's really annoying about, like whether you can wear a dress or not, I think, in the early games.
But yeah, the hairstyle thing kind of shocked me. And I was like, oh, interesting. So that's probably like the earliest thing I could trace it to where it's like, oh, you could have a boy's haircut when you're a girl and you can dye it a crazy colour.
And that's interesting. I feel like doing that today, you know?
Yeah.
A fun thing to discover.
Yeah, I don't think I ever changed my character's haircut once, which probably says more about me than anything. But I did definitely experiment with Wild World's ability to like create your own textures for costumes and other cosmetics in the world. And, you know, I was like, you know, 18 when this game was big in my life and watching a lot of Twin Peaks.
So I did the old zigzag floor fucking red curtains. Oh, yeah. Because, you know, that's what I did.
But, you know, I definitely got pretty in depth with it. I had a lot of affection for, you know, drawing on that grid on the bottom screen and then seeing those jaggy fucking 3D graphics, 3D graphics, seeing your creation, you know?
As they stretch it over like the chest of a giant chicken or... Like an Animal Crossing is great for this, because was it in those older games? Did the villagers also then start kind of like wearing what you'd make?
Because that was kind of an interesting exploration of fashion, when they'd like see each other wearing stuff and they'd be like, oh, I need this Twin Peaks shit. This is fire.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they do.
It was funny to see that like, it's funny to see that like, spreading through the town. It's even funnier when they like get hold of something that like, they're not supposed to have like a piece of a path that you've put on on the floor. And they're like, yeah, I love these threads, man.
Like, what a sick fit. And you're like, take that off right now.
That's like me trying to talk about clothes in real life. That's the kind of faux pas I make where everyone's like, oh no, he's decorated himself as a path and he doesn't know it.
He's wearing left path corner. Oh my god, how embarrassing. No, but it's about the vibe.
It's about the confidence. If you rock that shit like it was fully intentional, everyone will be like, oh my god, it's like Balenciaga type beat.
Well, it's definitely a key game in terms of, because it wasn't really much to do in World World when you really think about it compared to New Horizons and-
New Leaf, the best one. Let the record show the best one.
Controversial take, but hey, it didn't come out during COVID, so it's better to me.
That's what I think.
You're right, one of the key things was how much self-expression you can have in that game, which was quite pronounced and sort of helped balance out the lack of features compared to the GameCube one. Definitely important.
It's more about what can you muster up from the depths of your imagination, and your mileage may vary. I've always really loved those games because I'm just a little bit of a freak, and I like imagining stuff and professionally lying, which is why I'm a games writer.
It's the same sort of thing as like Sea of Thieves, right? It's probably possible to have not a great time in games like that, if you're not really deciding to engage with it in new and weird ways, because they're deliberately, a lot of it is left blank, so that you can customise it yourself, or have your own experience, or make up your own little scenario that's going on. So yeah, I think there's lots of people who are like, yeah, Animal Crossing is boring.
It's like, ah, but have you tried recreating Twin Peaks' carpet? You may find that your neurons activate. But yeah, I've always really loved games like that, rather than finding them quite boring, which is maybe why, when I think about dress up, and how free form and creative and interesting it is in and of itself.
Maybe that's why, like you say, Matthew, it's like a kind of a lot of the time looking for more games that might do that, rather than rely on just kind of like typical game systems.
Maybe there's also an element to it where, because you have all these real world thoughts and connections with fashion, and it means, you know, it's this vast subject, which you maybe can't accurately capture in a game system. You being able just to project a little bit of that onto the games is like maybe like enough, or a good substitute for those actual games existing. Like with Animal Crossing, I doubt, maybe I'm wrong here, but I would say I would doubt Nintendo thinking in any kind of profound way about, like, eventually feeding boys' haircuts to female characters, for example.
Like, maybe that's just, oh, we've run out of assets and so the panicking thing goes well. You can start having these instead.
How do we get more content?
But in it, because it doesn't really say anything or put forward a particular stance, you can take that and absorb it any way you want and, and sort of see it as something more, see it as something a bit more interesting or transgressive or whatever. So it struck me a lot of the games you talked about in the article, there is quite a bit of heavy lifting on the player's part to kind of find the profound in them.
Yeah, totally, totally. Like, and I think it just comes down to like, we're almost talking about death of the author, right? And it's like, yeah.
And I feel like maybe people who are interested in fashion and do think about it as more deeply than or creatively than just like putting something on your body so that people don't scream at you when you walk out the house. I think I think those sort of people are maybe just, maybe, more inclined to kind of play games in that way, right? And then all maybe gravitate towards those games that kind of allow more space for that.
Yeah, but I've just found it to be like a real rich source of just like thinking. And it was really interesting in that piece as well, to kind of, I dug around and dug around for kind of examples of games that maybe kind of did interrogate, kind of dress up a bit more and only came up with a couple. One of them was called Try to Dress Up by a game developer called Naveetha Cannon, and who's wonderful and gave a wonderful interview with me.
And that is about kind of her experience growing up in India with really strict Indian parents and having to navigate like the puzzle basically of putting on the right thing that would allow her parents to leave the house because she was kind of, you know, modest enough. But also something that did make her still feel like herself and like she liked it or that was kind of, you know, cool enough for a warm summer's day. And it was that whole game is on itch and it's free.
And I recommend playing it. But that whole game is about balancing those, that tension. And you're kind of at first, I'm like, I'm just putting together an outfit that I think looks cute according to me.
And then you try and leave the house and their parents are like, absolutely not. So you go back and you're like, okay, well, if I put on leggings, if it's not shorts, I'm probably going to be a bit hot in the sun. And the character kind of comments on it.
But like that kind of might allow it. And then you go out and then there's something else. And I found it quite hard to win.
And that was kind of an example of a game that I felt kind of more accurately kind of grappled with some of the more like narratively interesting kind of puzzles of dressing up, right? Through a real particular cultural lens. So yeah, it's interesting.
I'm like at the same, I'm like, I kind of want more free form dress up games that just doing it for the love of the game and like putting together an outfit where it's like, okay, the colours are balanced or I'm wearing my favourite colour and balancing it with something else and everything matches but not too matchy. And it's just pure design. But then I also want really specific games, dress up games that really specifically talk about kind of the really relatable interesting situations you can kind of experience through what you put on your body, right?
That's super interesting. I mean, we've kind of like round through a bunch of examples there of games that use this in different ways. I mean, I guess like we talked about two DS games there as well.
So I guess over the broader course of history, Jen, do you have any Hall of Famer games when it comes to character customisation past and present? What is the sign of a game doing it properly to you?
Yeah. I mean, I think it's so dependent on what your personal metric is, right? Because I think people just like approach character customisation in really different ways.
And I definitely like to hear about your approaches, because I'm like, when I'm in a game, what am I doing with character customisation? So I feel like often I'm making me plus, which is, I don't know if that's really narcissistic. I'm like me, but like I've got wings or something.
I feel like everyone does it differently. It's like, oh, do you go kind of full fantasy mode? You're like, I'm going to be something I could never look like in real life.
Or do you want to make you? Or do you want to kind of like role play a really specific kind of character? It's really interesting.
What do you guys do when you get in a character creator generally?
Matthew, do you want to start?
So it does depend a little bit. I guess an outright character creator, so like complete blank slate, you get to make a new body. I actually, I do have a character I try and build in every game.
It looks nothing like me. It is nothing like me.
An OC. Oh my God, reveal. I need to see Matthew Castle's OC.
This is amazing. Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's slightly reverse-engineered from the parts you tend to get in games, and that's kind of refined over the years.
Right.
But it's quite, kind of like, slightly kind of dapper looking. I'll tell you what it looks like.
I'm almost a little bit scared. I don't know about you, Sam. I'm like, what's about to be revealed?
I'm incredibly excited, that's what I am.
The really defining feature is he always has sort of grey, silvery hair, quite a neat haircut. Like, if there's like a, almost like a side party, it's quite, I think in my head, I'm thinking sort of quite a cliched sort of dashing kind of sword fight, almost like a sort of Errol Flynn, I like. But with grey hair, often a pencil thin moustache, if they've got one, which I'm looking to do, which is dark.
Yeah, a very notably dark moustache and eyebrows that really stand out against the grey hair.
Bit of Clooney to it, Matthew?
No, the face is often, if I can modify the face, it's quite thin and quite long. It often looks a little bit stern. I try and make him look a bit cross.
Right.
I try to make him look a little bit, like he's not old. I never touch the fucking wrinkled slider. I'm not interested in that.
Age slider. Yeah.
Incredibly cursed, that stuff. But I do try and make, I don't know, he looks like a late 40s person. I want a hero who looks like he's lived in the world a bit.
This is so specific, but I love this. Like this is exactly what this is. I'm like, this is amazing.
Just weaving this like rich fiction of this. I'm sure like a million other people do. I'd love to know what readers think about this as well.
Because like, I'm sure people do do this. And it's so funny because this is absolutely, I don't have like an OC for games, but it's such a good idea. I want to do it now.
This is amazing. Does he have a name?
Well, yeah, it's terrible.
It's very like, I think it's very good of you to offer up this information, Matthew.
No, no, it's terribly embarrassing.
You're a good sport for talking about this, in my opinion.
He's not called Matthew and he's not called Basil Pesto, because that's obviously, that's mad. He's always called, and you've got to really forgive me, this is so lame when you say it out loud.
He's always called Silvio. Silvio!
No, that's amazing. That fully goes with the whole, like, swashbuckling. And he's also a Silver Fox kind of thing.
Yeah, weirdly. I think it actually, it doesn't go that far back, but it probably, like, the OG Silvio was my Mass Effect Shepherd.
Right, yeah.
Because he got carried through the games and maintained, you know, because you could import the look and everything. I think that, weirdly, that three-game journey just locked him in as, like, this is what the character will always look like in games, if I have the option.
That is amazing. Where's he been most recently? Has there been a recent game?
Dragon Age, um, Veilguard.
Oh yeah, the new one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. I'd say, like, the game where he most fit, and I spent the most time with him, was Dragon Age Inquisition. He really suited that world, because, you know, as this slightly older character, like, you know, that's, you know, slightly more grown-up fantasy world.
There are a lot of, like, middle-aged people in that game, and he really kind of fit it well.
That's genuinely so inspiring to me. I love it. I'm like, I now want to steal, maybe not Silvio, but this idea is incredible.
What was the worst version of him?
The worst version of him, because there just wasn't, like, the character creation is so simple, because you're really far out, was, I tried making him in Pillars of Eternity, which you just don't, because you're obviously really zoomed out to see RPG and it's that isometric view, but he's got, like, a little grey hair and he's called Silvio still, but it always made me laugh when I saw him, so I was like, that's so far from how good he looks in other games.
They've perverted Silvio, how dare they do this? My boy, they've massacred my boy.
Yeah.
This is an amazing piece of information, and, like, it's weird hearing you be, like, so reticent about it when I'm like, this is a genuinely cool idea. But like, I wonder, is there, like, that element of kind of cringe about it, where it's like, you're kind of doing something creative and highly specific, and it's like, what if people think this is really lame? Yeah, it's hard.
Yeah, I just don't, I don't want people to think this is how I, I don't, like, imagine myself like this. Like, I don't want people to think, like, I'm quite comfortable in, like, who I am and how I appear in the world. That's more the thing.
I don't want anyone to think, like, oh, he's created, like, this, he's, like, role playing.
It's this, like, weird, I know, but, like, why is, why is that so cringe? Boy, I think that's amazing. I mean, don't get me wrong.
It's fucking funny. But it's, but like, it's also kind of amazing. I honestly think there's dozens of you out there doing this.
I want, I want to see some more OCs now. I want to see Backpage Podge OCs from games. Because I reckon people come out the woodwork, like, what is it, is it like Spider-Man 2?
Everyone kind of steps forward. And then like, and also me. I can see it happening.
Or everyone's like, oh, cringe, don't step forward. Let's not embarrass ourselves.
What the hell? Yeah. Everyone's like, wow, this man is disturbed.
Let him stand alone.
I've heard enough to ship Silvio with Cassandra in Dragon Age and Quasar's Imagine.
Yeah, let's do it.
I support them getting together.
I'm all in. Look, this is the power of OCEs. This has floated a thousand fan fiction sites, this content.
You have to lean in. Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
The only time I have made myself, just because I thought the customisation was so good that I could actually give it a good go, was in Dragon's Dogma 2, where my player character looks quite like me, and it's actually quite spooky how accurate it is. Some people took screen shots of it at work, and it became an emoji on Slack, which is like, I think it's called Castle's Dogma, is the name of the emoji. And it's like my face, it's like in the shot, I'm just being hit, so like it's me like reminiscing, like going, ah!
Every time someone posts like a terrible take, you just react and that, I can see the use.
Yeah, that's when Castle's Dogma gets used.
But it's funny, I made a note on that, on kind of this area that I was like, yeah, like it's kind of interesting. It's like, okay, do you want to kind of make a fantasy? Do you want to kind of tell a story?
Do you want the game to kind of tell you a story about the player character, depending on kind of what it's letting you customise? And I think there's some games that do that. But then I was like, it's also just funny when it's just a place to be ridiculous, right?
And just make this the stupidest thing you possibly can in the most creative way. I've been replaying a bunch of Tomodachi Life on the 3DS, because obviously the new one's coming out next year. I can't wait.
But the things you can do with Mii's even, and the creative things people do to make these crazy cartoon characters in Mii form, the way they kind of pervert sunglasses and weird abstractly shaped noses and stuff to kind of sketch out characters is so fun and impressive. And I also remember playing a lot of Soul Calibur VI and just sticking random things to characters to make like absolutely kind of mad renditions of things. It's just a funny place just to like, when you can just make a joke out of it as well, it just becomes like a little creative kind of platform within the game.
It's like the prologue to the game is just like making the most cursed character you can imagine. And that just so much value as well.
I think that really takes me back like the first, I would imagine, particularly for men of a certain age, the first character customization they maybe really got into was like Create a Wrestler in Wrestlemania games. Like, because that, I remember spending like many evenings around friends houses, making people we didn't like in WWE games and then beating the shit out of them, which is really sinister thing to do.
Yeah. Honestly, same vibe as Tomodachi life, where you just trap everyone who's ever wronged you on an island and make them just like, reject each other constantly.
It stopped you from going on a killing spree, Matthew. So that's good at least.
In WWE, you can like lower all their stats so they're really weak and make them really brittle so they're really easy to destroy. It's just not fun, you know, beating up on people and then seeing them the next day at school and knowing in your head that that's what you did last night.
Just replaying it over and over with grim satisfaction.
That's proper serial killer behaviour.
I love it. You're revealing a lot about yourself in this section of the pod.
Yeah, an unexpected amount of gold has come out of this discussion.
See, I knew it. Look, when we start thinking about like character customisation and dress up, everyone starts revealing their deepest, darkest tendencies. I absolutely love it.
Samuel, what can you bring to the table? What have you got on?
So, it's funny because I've got quite a few examples of this. Just last night, I started playing June Awakening, actually, and whenever I get into a character creator, I do have the run at creating myself, but I realised how highly specific I actually look. I'm always like, right, shoulder slider to the top, chin slider to the bottom, no slider to the top.
And then, by that point, you got a pretty good idea of whether you can make me in a game or not. And I had to go, making myself didn't really get anywhere close, but still wanted to avoid being like budget Chalamet or budget Jason Momoa or any of the June characters that you know and love. And so, but still ended up with someone highly generic.
And then I was playing an expansion pack to the original Half-Life this morning, and there were some marine dudes in there. One of them is quite potato faced, and he looked more like me than the character I created in June was so much more fidelity. So that was devastating.
But I have a few examples of like the only example I've really got of, I would say I've sometimes picked like characters with a different, you know, sort of racial heritage to me because, not because I'm being like performative or anything, but because like a video, I guess video games are an interesting space to explore, you know, something like that or to create a character who's not you. And I've also, you know, I've created, for GTA Online, I created, I created a female character because there were, you know, there aren't any main characters in that game who are female. So I thought, oh, you know, playing as a woman in this world might be interesting.
And then got like ridiculed so bad for my character looking like someone's mum, who'd like gone to pick up her kids. And like, I never, I never crawled out from under the shadow of that.
Wait, ridiculed where? Like in the game? Like people just drive by insults?
By my PC Gamer colleagues.
Were you deliberately trying to like not make it look kind of creepy?
You were like, this is not a horny GTA Online type of thing?
It's just a, yes, it's a woman with, I think like, I think I did go for like grey hair, which might have been like the mistake. Maybe that's where like the mum thing comes from.
How dare you acknowledge the existence of older women? We don't do that. We don't do that here.
Well, that's the thing, that's the thing. I just thought, oh, I've been quite, I've been quite sincere here. I'm not really, there's no like ideology behind me.
I mean, I did have good intentions in terms of like balancing the, you know, the mix of the game characters a little bit, but I wasn't trying to be performative and it backfired so badly. But she was just wearing jeans and a t-shirt. I think we even had our own PC Gamer logo t-shirt in there, which probably didn't help.
But so yeah, that got ridiculed so badly. But the thing is, you can't really make massive cosmetic changes to your GT Online character once you've got them. So whenever it's heist time with the PC Gamer lot, it's like, here's my mum character again and your three lads.
Which is brutal, but it's more funny than it is devastating. Therefore, it's a net gain.
Yeah, that's genuinely amazing. That was like, Baldur's Gate 3 I was playing. Like the cool thing about Baldur's Gate 3 character creator is like it gives you two goes at it.
So like, so one of them I just did, I'm so boring. I just basically did me plus. I was like, what if I was a druid?
And oh, so then I was like, yeah, basically make her as like sexy and beautiful and powerful as possible. Let's go. Living out with my fantasies.
And then they were like, oh, yeah, then you got to make a guardian. And I was like, oh. And I was like, okay, what if it's just the most white bread man imaginable with like a big mustache and a tattoo under his eye.
And I just call him Cousin Gary and my headcanon. This is like he's like on like he's just been released from prison. He's coming to save my life.
The life of this like druid with like, you know, all the cliché like heterochromia and all of the, you know, all of the coolest, most bisexual character traits. So it's like this crazy like druid who can turn into a spider and be kick ass and then just Cousin Gary like bumbling after. So yeah, I was like a shout out to Borders Gate 3 for giving you two goes at it.
I'm like, okay, here's where I can be cringe and power fantasy. And then here's where I can meme. And everyone has to look at Cousin Gary as they play Borders Gate 3 with me in a party.
I find a lot of it does come down to how accurately can you make yourself in the actual creator because I mean, I don't know how you find with being you Jen, you are a very different looking person to me. But Mass Effect was like a bit of a milestone for character creators, I think. And I could make a potato in that game, but it was my potato.
Like if you turn sideways, it looked like the side of my head to the point where... It's all over. I got it right like once and people went, wow, it really does look like you when you turn sideways.
That is amazing because I feel like that is the bit that always got me. From the front, I'd be like, yes. And then turns the side and you're like, never mind.
Oh my God, what have I done? So well done to you because that's good going.
Yeah, it's tricky but when I create myself, I'm like, all I really look like is a slightly worse version of a character someone would create on purpose for a AAA video game. Oh my God. It's a bit like also like I think realistically, myself and Matthew are more of the build of guy who like the protagonist fights in a major part of the story because there's normally like a beefy villain amongst like a group of villains.
You're talking like kind of mid-level goon is what you're kind of thinking.
Absolutely. Sometimes I feel about when I try and create myself, I'm like, well, I don't think I would be the protagonist. I think I do make more sense as like a hood.
You fight halfway through the game.
Too powerful. You've got to embrace it, I think. And your unique kind of powers in that scenario.
Loads of people would kill for that sort of mid-level influence on the journey of a video game character.
Yeah, it's true. I think the game's demands also shape it to some extent as well. A bit like Matthew, I didn't create a character with as much detail as Silvio, but I did try and create someone who, I think I created this blonde-looking Bowie-esque guy because I knew he had a voice and a very distinct voice.
I was like, I don't think I can buy that as me, and I have to like, but I want to create someone who would be as distinctive as another Dragon Age character would. It was thinking about them in that. I think I did a really good job with that.
My first ever Inquisition safe profile was spot on for that. But yeah, the demands of what the game's context is does shape that to some extent.
Totally.
Yeah. That's a very long answer to your question.
But it's fun. Then it becomes like another kind of creative exercise. Although I totally also get people who just like, oh, fuck this, and they just hit randomise a few times, right?
Because they're like, there's loads of people who could not be less interested, right, in spending forever customising a character, because they're like, I just want to play the game. But it is always interesting talking to people who do feel, it sounds like you both do feel compelled to not just hit random most of the time, which is nice. I do think it might be like a creative people thing, where like there's that urge to kind of create like a cool visual avatar in some way that says something.
Yeah, it still exists within, for me anyway, some quite strict sort of conservative boundaries. There's so many parts of character customisation I never engage with. Like I've, you know, I don't put any makeup on my character.
I never have any like tattoos or anything outside of like the most straightforward boring treatment possible. And I, you know, I always go through these menus and think, oh man, like all this is just so wasted on me. Someone put a lot of time and effort into this.
I was going to say, but like a cool scar like cannot be underrated. I love a cool scar because that immediately, like if you're making up like a little story in your head about this character, I love stuff like that. You're like, oh yeah, got into a fight with a mafioso at some point.
Silvio has never been hurt.
He's invincible. He's pristine. Pristine, untouched.
Weirdly though, like while I put a lot of effort into making him, when I have like complete free reign, I probably spent more time in game worrying about what a character looks like when it is slightly more prescribed, like, you know, you're playing a specific person. Like I don't think I spent as much time sort of faffing with cosmetics and my general appearance than I did in like weirdly Red Dead Redemption 2, where I felt like I was constantly I was constantly like fighting the outdoor life and not wanting to not wanting to look like some sort of bandit who had just been kind of pulled through a bush. Like I was always going to town and having shaves, haircuts and baths and buying nice clothes.
Like I wanted him to look really clean. Like I had a very specific, sophisticated gunslinger in mind that I wanted him to be. And upholding that and like washing him down like once he'd fallen in the mud or whatever.
Like that was quite a weird ritual for me in that game.
I love that, like fully kind of, again it's like a role play exercise, right? Where you're like, oh, this is kind of the character I imagine, I guess, Arthur to be in my head. And I have to kind of protect the sanctity of that through what he looks like.
And yeah, it's so interesting that like you were saying before, as a player, you kind of took it upon yourself to do that. Like definitely the devs are aiding it, I guess, right? By putting those things in.
It's like, it's not just a way to pass the time. Like it is affecting the way your character looks. But yeah, so interesting that, you know, you then kind of ascribe that duty to yourself.
And it's like, you know, people do similar things in real life, right? Some people are kind of less worried about that and having a shave, or like always looking pristine. But like, I'm definitely one of those people where, you know, the kind of routine you're describing role playing, like Arthur in like Red Dead Redemption 2, like me as a person in real life, you know, I get a lot of like, probably like a similar feeling that you got from doing my own kind of like, I don't know, like skincare routines at home, or like dressing in a certain way.
And because I guess, right, I'm like, I'm kind of protecting the sanctity of my own, like how I feel as a person and how I want people to kind of perceive me based on the kind of care I'm taking of myself. So yeah, interesting that that comes up in Red Dead 2 as well. And like in a very like masculine context as well is really cool.
And I've heard similar things like that about kind of, because Red Dead is such a detailed game in that, right? And a detailed game about detailed rituals a lot of the time. It's lovely to see, especially a lot of like, you know, male players like really enjoy that.
It's like, oh, how nice. So, you know, maybe they'll get into like skin care in the real world.
I feel like skin care is basically what separates Arthur from all the monsters in the gang.
This man has a retinal routine and he's powerful.
There are so many shitty bastards in that game who don't think about that. Like, I really do think I was trying to distance myself from everyone else in the gang.
Yeah, it's cool, isn't it? I just love thinking about that stuff. You're like, yeah, you know what?
I'm the kind of the fearless leader and the kind of sophisticated gunslinger and stuff. And you're like, right now I have to put hours in of the game of like committing to that. It's so cool.
And then I think hopefully then you start like, if you're not usually a person that thinks in like that level of detail about like the way that you kind of do that in real life, you kind of start thinking about those little routines you do in real life to kind of, you know, uphold your image the way you want. I'm sure there's loads of people that kind of don't, but like definitely I know like loads of people in real life who like they have like a signature look or something, right? And they kind of invest money and time into upkeeping that because it's somehow like a really cool part of their identity.
And they kind of take joy in the doing of it. It's kind of like a Zen thing in a way. It's really interesting.
Yeah, I have a very particular hair style that I've stuck with for the last like three or four years, right? And it's fucking pain in the ass to like bleach super accurately. You have to do it like every six weeks because it grows out and somehow I've maintained that for like three or four years because I hit on it and I was like, this somehow makes me feel like me.
And then I've spent however many hours and packets of bleach kind of up keeping that. But it might be something that's like completely alien to someone who's like, oh my God, that sounds like an absolute faff that I don't want to waste my time on, you know? But yeah, I just like this kind of level of stuff, I think is so interesting that, yeah, it's interesting seeing versions of that popping up in big games and quite mainstream games as well.
I think I was always just really shocked that the indie scene hadn't really gone much into kind of the identity politics of fashion and body modification and stuff. It's kind of shocking to me that the indie scene, who's full of people with piercings and mad hair and cool senses of style, I was like, no one's really writing games about this, which feels really sad, yeah.
Well, I mean, before we move on to some, I've got some other questions that I'll ask you, Jen, but you did suggest the plan. Also curious to know about both of your experiences dressing up in real life. E.g.,
do you think about what you wear much day to day? Why slash why not? Ever want anything special that made you feel different in some way, negatively or positively?
Now, I could have breezed right past that, but, you know, I've been doing this long enough now to know when there's some podcasting goals out of my list.
We're going for the hat trick on this episode, truly. Poor Matthew will not escape the games.
Well, there's definitely more I want to ask you about, but, I mean, yeah, I mean, this is an interesting question because I would say that, you know, the type of blokes that myself and Matthew are, we're like, we're very much people who wear a shirt and jeans and then that's kind of it. It doesn't always seem to be much thought. When you come across games journalists who do think consciously about how they dress and how they style themselves, it's, I would say they are, you know, I would say they're not the norm and people do make the jokes about converse for a reason.
So yeah, I mean, yeah, Matthew, I'll put this to you, but I will answer it myself so it balances out. But, you know, do you ever think much about how you dress in real life?
No, not really, which would be a huge surprise to you. I genuinely think 90% of what I own was bought for me by other people. It is a wardrobe that is restocked and refreshed birthdays and Christmas.
I've had to buy a bit more recently just because I'm that much fatter, and I have to buy a lot of emergency clothes that I can fit into, which is rough. Yeah, I've just never really thought about it. Well, I'm saying that.
Jeans, a t-shirt and a checkered shirt while absolutely like the worst male games journalist cliché imaginable. You know, I definitely do adhere to that. It was funny when Jenny was mentioning the stress of maintaining your hairstyle as it is.
It made me laugh because one thing I am quite particular about is whenever I get my hair cut, I always show the hair dresser the same photo. I have a photo that I cut my hair like this.
And it's Silvio. It's Silvio.
Yes. Yes.
It's a screenshot from Mass Effect circa 2009 that I cut out from X-Controller.
Imagine. No. Well, you...
They're like, who's this man?
Actually, I say that. What the photo is, it's a very blurry mobile phone photo I took of my editor's picture in O&M.
Oh my god, amazing. Yeah, you're like, this is when it looked how I wanted it to look.
Yeah, that's probably like the nicest photo there's ever been of me because it was taken in like a photo studio and the person could put me at ease and not make me look crazy. But my hair just looked quite good. There is this sort of like undercurrent between me and the hairdresser where she's like, well, you know, I can make it look like this, but like the head it's attached to is quite different now.
You know, and so because I'm always like, I never quite looks like the photo. And it's like, yeah, that's because you've got twice as much face as you had back then. Which is so.
But once you get over that, I like that we have this photo and that's probably the most sort of the thing I'm fusses about probably is my hair. I'm lucky to still have some hair, you see. And so I think I am sort of subliminally, you know, taking care of it and flaunting it.
Yeah, it's nice to hear where people like put their like attention most, right? Like on what they keep. And yeah, you're like, yeah, it sounds like, right.
You kind of want to go for like comfort maybe, right? In your clothes, which is like totally, totally an approach, right? You're like, I just want to be comfortable.
And almost it's like, you know, if you're kind of going for, like, as you say, like the game journalist cliche, I think even that says something where it's like, you know, you kind of want to like blend in a little bit. Like, I have quite an eclectic sense of style, but it changes from day to day. Like, you know, there's some days where I'm quite happy to be, like, stared at, right?
For wearing some like weird shit, which I do. But like some days it's like, actually, I don't really want people to stare. And like, and there are kind of different clothes that you wear for that, especially as a woman as well.
So like, yeah, for me, it's like a very like shifting, kind of what I want from the way I look day to day, depending on like my mood and like, whether I'm in the mood to like have a conversation with a stranger or something. But yeah, yeah, it's interesting to hear about your approach, because it's like, actually, I'd kind of rather be comfortable and functional and blend in, but my hair I'm really particular about. Yeah, it's just really cool how everyone's kind of different on that.
What about you, Sam?
I mean, I don't make as much effort as I should. I like the idea of being more fashionable, but I feel like a lot of the eras of fashion I've lived through, I just don't quite make sense in them. Or if I dress like them, it just seems in Congress.
There's a lot of dudes right now who I've noted have the Paul Mescal hair in similar fashion.
Yeah, the mullet.
Yeah, exactly. That dude is incredibly influential on how a lot of men in their 20s and 30s dress. And so I don't think I'm anywhere near that because I'm just, Paul Mescal is a tiny man.
And again, if you scale that up to me, it just doesn't quite, I don't think it quite makes sense. I think maybe you need to style yourself a bit differently when you are, you know, have a slightly different body shape. So that I never really quite figure that out.
But every now and then I think I dress fairly well for the size I am. But in terms of like, but I would say I fret a bit more about my hair. I have fucking loads of hair.
It's going nowhere. It's not receding at all. And it gets incredibly curly if it gets too long in a very cursed way.
I've never seen your hair curly. You must chop it back then.
I've got an all-time tweet of my college photo when it grew. I mean, it's not good, Jen. This won't be a net gain for you seeing this.
But it's funny because I'm rapidly going grey. And I sort of like, I'm 37, so I'm nearing 40. And I sort of think past 40, it probably won't matter as much.
But I am sort of like constantly weighing up, do I do the just for men thing where suddenly parts of your bathroom are covered in purple stains? Yeah. And I hear lots of horror stories about men's hair dye as well.
And I'm like, I don't know. And so far, I've only dabbled and not really jumped into that. And I'm always a bit too self-conscious to do anything really bold fashion-wise.
And I would say that very much separates us from you, Jen. We're just a bit too cowardly, I think, to ever really attain that level of self-expression.
I'm just annoying. And the older I get, the more annoying I am. I think when I was younger, I was a lot more concerned with wearing similar things to other people.
And I had two older brothers who definitely, I'd say, naturally, I'd like to try different fashion things and stuff. And I had two older brothers who would relentlessly bully me. God bless them, love them lots.
But the older I get, the less I give a fuck, really. And the happier I am with trying to look on the outside, how I feel on the inside. So I'm definitely weirder with it.
But yeah, like you say, it's a thing of self-consciousness. And you never want to push too far out of your comfort zone, because you just don't want to be uncomfortable when you're out about trying to live your life. Like you don't really want to be a landmark, right?
Like you're just trying to live your life most of the time. But yeah, the older I've gotten, the further and further I've managed to push into just wearing what I like. But it's definitely been a gradual thing that I've chosen to lean more into.
And now I think people don't really bat an eye when I wear crazy colors or plastic horns or something. I'm so cringe man, but I don't care. If I think it looks cool, that's kind of it for me.
So yeah, and I find that some things like people kind of stare at you more, but mostly everyone's kind of just only focused on themselves and how they look. So yeah, and I find that, I'm sure it depends on kind of who's attached to all the get up and stuff as well. But I find like I've had lots of positive experiences with it, and I'm really inspired by like seeing, I call them like MPCs around Guilford basically, who kind of dress in their own mad ways.
Like there's a woman I see all the time, she must be about 80, and head to toe she is like fuchsia pink, like the brightest, like her hair is like bright pink. Every single item of clothing she wears is like bright pink, and she has like pink bejeweled sandals. Every time I see her, she's wearing like nothing but that exact shade of pink, and I'm just like, oh, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
It's just, I think you're so cool, and I mentioned like tell her that one day, and she was like, oh, thank you, like, it's just so cool. I love when people do that because I feel like it brightens my day to kind of see someone who's really just doing their own thing with like absolutely no qualms at all, and I think it just kind of boosts your mood a bit. Like, I'm sure people see people like that and like sneer and whatever, and like, sure, but you just know that that person has their own thing going on.
And like, I really enjoy that. And yeah, it feels more like a character design, right? Like the kind of thing where you play a video game and you're like, damn, that's a cool character design.
And you can kind of tell their personality and stuff. I just find that it brightens my day, especially in a grey little Tory town like Guildford, you know? But there's loads of those people, like more than you would expect in Guildford.
There's sometimes quite elderly people who would like absolutely like rock in their own shit. And it just, yeah, it just kind of, I don't know, kind of like maybe loosens up kind of people around them, you know, is where you look at them and you're like, damn, if she can do that at 80, then I can still wear like bullshit plastic horns when I'm 32. I'm sure I can get away with it if I'm happy, you know?
Yeah, I think that if this was like a dragon game, that Lady Infusia would definitely have a side quest for you.
Yes.
That's absolutely the vibe I'm getting from that.
Absolutely. You'd have to go like babysit her Dachshunds or something like that. And then you'd have to fight the Dachshunds, I don't know.
Well, I want to ask you a bit about Cosplay Gem, but I do think a good transition to that might be, like which games do you think have a coherent sense of fashion and do fashion well? Like, you know, have, yeah, I guess like some sort of cohesive artistic approach that makes you think, damn, they've got the good taste behind these character designs. Which games kind of like get you thinking in that way?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Good taste is one thing. It's such a broad question because it's like, okay, which games are good at kind of representing maybe what fashion or style is, then there's just like, which games have like well dressed characters. I think we've like addressed a lot of them that I really like that kind of, the thing I really like to see in kind of dress up or fashion adjacent games is that understanding of like the social effect of it.
So we've talked about kind of Animal Crossing and Hitman and tried to dress up that, that indie game I think is like a really interesting narrative take on it. The Love Nikki series really like should have more love and attention, especially like the earlier games, because like the whole storyline and law of those mobile dress up games is amazing. Like it really treat takes kind of fashion super seriously.
So seriously, it's kind of ridiculous, but also correct. Because the whole law of those games is like violence is sort of not a thing in this universe because everybody is labouring under the effects of this like blood curse. So if you cause any kind of physical harm to someone else, you basically suffer this like intense like mental like anguish.
So nobody like fights, right? There's no wars. So the way that they like settle kind of international political disputes is through like styling battles.
And so like warriors in this world are like stylists. And it gets it gets absolutely crazy, especially when like knives and guns start getting involved as like accessories. It's completely mad.
But like I really appreciate what these games do in terms of kind of thinking about fashion as as as like power and political power. I think that's great. One game I wanted to ask whether either of you two had played, because I haven't and people tell me to play it all the time and for my sins, I still haven't.
Have either of you played The World Ends with you?
Yeah, we both have.
So like the button system, I feel like that's maybe adjacent to the kind of stuff we've been talking about, where it's like kind of customising your like buttons. It's like kind of gives you different powers and fights and stuff. Is that am I completely off the mark?
No, no, that's that's that's right. Yeah, like little pin badges and all very kind of artfully designed. And you want to collect them.
Yeah, if they were real things, you could see people collecting them because they've got quite cool designs on them. And even like there are like brands in that world, you know, different brands within that system. And that's quite coherent.
They had them in the Square Enix shop in Acau Bar, Matthew.
I feel like Square Enix has been quite concerned with fashion, haven't they? Because they did what? Lightning Returns, and then they had like the actual kind of like clothing brands and stuff like, was it Lightning Returns that had like handbags and stuff?
Yeah, I think she was, I think they got like a render of Lightning modeling her, like some one fashion brand. I cannot remember which one. But yeah, that was like a big thing, I think.
Square Enix seem like they've got their ear to the ground on this stuff a little bit.
Didn't someone design the wedding dress in Final Fantasy XV? Wasn't that a thing? A real world designer designed like a key costume in XV that they did as a big promotion.
Well, those guys are very well dressed in that. And I think that probably sums up. If you think about The World Ends With You is like a Nomura produced, it feels like a passion project for Nomura, right?
And I think that guy is just really, really kind of like conscious of fashion. And his character designs get a lot of kind of, they're interrogated a lot by the fan base because they're so different from what Amano's earlier designs of those series looked like. His characters are just, but I would also argue that those character designs are kind of responsible for Final Fantasy's runaway success in the PS1 years onwards because those characters are just so popular among people who enjoy anime or are just plugged into Japanese culture.
There is something very contemporary about them. So, yeah, I couldn't find out who designed the new front-end dress, Matthew.
Someone write in, someone out there listening will know, almost certainly. But yeah, Squeenix seemed really on it. I think the other big one to mention is Splatoon.
It's impossible to not look stylish in Splatoon. And all the little kind of internal kind of logos and brands they have for all of that stuff is amazing. I remember Splatoon 3, I was one of those people that downloaded the app and religiously was checking it every day for about a year to make sure I got some exclusive cool trainers that I could then download to my Switch.
I feel like I not missed the point of Splatoon a little bit. I liked it as a game, but I feel increasingly when I see the kind of tale that game has and what people really like about it, I think I was so the wrong person to review that. Just because it has.
Yeah, like culture almost.
Yeah, but I kind of don't, I didn't really kind of connect with it in any meaningful way.
You didn't even decorate your little locker. Did you get into that?
Oh, I think I did stick. Yeah, I got some stickers and things.
That was great though, because there was a whole thing in that as well, where people started putting, I think, was it like the Maui head or something in the locker, just like and holding a gun. And it became this massive meme, so every time you'd open the locker, there'd be a Maui head pointing a gun at you, and then you open the next one, and it's the same and stuff like that. And it just kind of spread like that.
But yeah, it's funny, obviously, you haven't really been part of that side of it, but that to me kind of felt, along with the kind of plaza drawings and stuff, that is another game that really captures that idea of a scene, right? And around kind of customisation and fashion. And there were like memes that were like exclusively happening basically in the context of the plaza that people are copying.
And then also, you know, there were kind of these like fashion cycles, depending on kind of which items are like added to the game as well, and which kind of fits people were making. And that was like, yeah, a huge part of the game that I really enjoyed, in addition to, obviously, it's just a really fun multiplayer shooter. Yeah.
But yeah, that's kind of an amazing exploration of it that I've been thinking about lately, definitely.
Do you rate the fashion in Persona? Because that's always a game where, you know, I don't interrogate it too deeply, but I always think, oh, these impossibly stylish teenagers, they all look so cool. But I haven't thought too deeply about it.
I'm kind of curious what you make of it.
I don't know if it's like realistic to me. Like to me, they look more like character designs than like fashion, which is like an interesting thought in itself, right? Like, it's almost like a character design is just kind of like very orchestrated and specific and unchanging.
And it serves its own function, right? With kind of storytelling and stuff like that and kind of becoming an emblem. But yeah, like for me, I kind of just don't see persona in my kind of head as like a fashion game, because it just seems like a game with really well-designed characters that have their outfits.
Whereas like, you know, for me, Splatoon is much more of a fashion game, because it's more of a kind of changing, breathing thing, right? I think that's a really important part, if I had to say, between defining something where it's like, this is a game with like a really intentional character design, and this is a game that kind of thinks about dress-up and fashion. I think that like change element is probably really important to go beyond just like character design.
Does that make sense?
Well, I'm really glad to hear you make that distinction actually, because I think that helps me understand how you think about these things a bit more, which is super useful. So yeah, I did want to add two little fact check bits by the way. So it was Louis Vuitton that Lightning modelled around the time Lightning Returns.
Yeah, it was quite an interesting kind of campaign. And then Matthew, it was Vivian Westwood who designed the Lila Freyja's wedding dress in FF15. And then the rest of the costumes were designed by the creative director of a brand, I think a Japanese brand called Rowan, R-O-E-N.
So yeah, those were all, you know, actually, they designed those costumes in real life for those characters.
That is sick to know about the wedding dress, because I'm a big Vivian Westwood fan. And like, that's an example of a designer that really has something to say with their fashion designs, as many of like the greatest ones like often do, right? It's not just about making something beautiful.
It's about making a statement like Vivian Westwood, like, is punk incarnate, right? And then her fashion designs are often like really political, her runways are political. And yeah, really cool, like the collaboration there with like really iconic design.
I'm going to have to look up that dress, but that's sick.
Yeah, super, super cool. Okay, so, you know, I did want to kind of like go from that to talking a bit about Cosplay, Jen, because I suppose this is the most useful transition point, I guess, because, you know, you talked there about maybe the distinction between a good character design and what good fashion looks like in a game. But I think this is interesting because the self-expression side is worth digging into.
Like, why do you think that people cosplay on a fundamental level, Jen? You observed that for some people who play games, you weren't generalizing here, but I think you're talking about like a subset of people who cosplay. Cosplaying might be one of the few times they think in detail about what they wear, which I don't think is totally unfair if you base on the examples of myself and Matthew, for example.
But I was just curious what your thoughts were around that.
Yeah, it's interesting when we're talking about fashion and making a statement about yourself, when this is definitely dressing up as a character. In most times, but not all, I'd say. But yeah, it's amazing seeing people who are really passionate about cosplay because people are so committed to the detail, like reproducing the details of something.
And it's like wearable art, basically. And if you're like a proper cosplayer, I'm definitely not. Like, whenever I do it, it's very, it's very hobbyist.
I'm just kind of like buying bits and like customising them a little bit to get them closer to whatever character I want to portray. But yeah, like the hardcore ones, you know, it's the done thing to make absolutely everything yourself from scratch and you're like sewing and, you know, making everything. So it's like a whole like art scene basically, but it's like wearable art.
Like I'm sure you guys have also seen like cosplays where people are like optimist prime, like one time I was in like the pub outside Comic-Con and there was like a full on transformer like on the dance floor in like a full light up armour and he was like 10 foot tall and he made it all himself. And it's like, how the hell are you doing that? But yeah, it feels like a kind of wearable art thing and a role playing thing, right?
Like we're doing in character customisation sometimes if you're making a Silvio. It's about kind of making like wearable art and then almost doing performance art for some people as they kind of role play it. It's a really creative thing as well because it's not just people recreating character designs, right?
And I guess you could say it's fashioning that people, I suppose people sometimes tend to pick characters that they feel maybe like they'd like to be or dress like, right? But maybe if it's too self-conscious to kind of come up with your own kind of outfit, it's like, oh, well, I really like, you know, Joker from Persona. So I'm, you know, maybe I secretly wish I could dress up like this every day.
So I'm going to have a day at Con where I do that. And I feel powerful and cool. But obviously you can't really go to Tesco in your like, like, Phantom Beef outfit.
You could try, but you might be judged. Whereas, you know, Comic Con, you can kind of do that and push the boat out and maybe wear something that you think is, is, is exciting and cool and makes you feel powerful in a space where it's socially acceptable, right? I think that's like the big draw a lot of the time, potentially for people who maybe don't dress up a lot outside of that.
It's like, oh, I can go to a space where everyone's doing this, like, like 10 people next to me are in an even more wild costume. And like, I'm just kind of one of many and I can kind of enjoy like the way I look and, you know, people kind of commenting on what you've made or how you look or wanting pictures. Like, you can see kind of how it's a really nice kind of social occasion to do that.
And it's like, okay, this is the time to dress up because yeah, it's like the character creator in real life, right? And even more so when people kind of make up their own or do kind of jokey twists on original on characters, but kind of there'll be people doing puns on it. Well, they'll kind of do a different version of the character that they've kind of wish would exist, maybe.
I've seen that a lot in cosplay. So, yeah, it's kind of people character creating in real life and kind of communicating with with other people through what you wear, I think, again, you know, it's like it's all dress up. It's like, I'm a I'm a fan of this.
Or like, you know, here's a visual joke, I'm telling you. Yeah, it's a really interesting kind of mass communication through clothes event, I suppose. I'm sure there's a more like elegant way of putting that.
But even though it's like there's definitely elements of it where you're like, damn, this is a lot of I mean, it's kind of like an introvert's worst nightmare. It's like a room full of like crazy, sweaty nerds in like ridiculous get ups. But I think from the sheer scale and like everyone being on the exact same page, yeah, it's kind of this amazing kind of magical space sometimes when it happens, where it's like, oh yeah, like, this is the space that this happens in and people can kind of enjoy the effects of wearing something like outlandish and communicating what they want to communicate.
You can totally observe trends from it as well. Like when I went to two Star Wars celebrations in a row in 2017 and 2016, and the amount of people dressed as Rey, as Daisy Wigley's character, just showed like the value of that character in real time.
Yeah.
Yeah. And like, I mean, you know, JJ Abrams later turned that character into a flaming ball of wreckage in that last film, but, you know, for a while there it was pretty good. So, yeah, but it's true, like these things really catch on and people feel like, you know, yeah, this is a space in which they can express that kind of kinship with the character, basically.
So it's also easier to pull off Raven is Babu Frick.
But, you know, you've got to get extra props for the Babu Frick though. That's not an easy construction.
Yeah. Sorry. As you were.
No, that's fine. I'm looking forward to the comic on Matthew, where we both dress as Mr. X from Resident Evil 2 Remake. That's definitely in the post.
Yes.
Yeah, I think that would be great. So that's, I mean, five grand on Patreon. We'll do it.
I mean, are you joking? Or is there a potential? Would you actually do this?
Or are you like, no, too cringe, too much effort? Like, I don't know. Come on.
It'd be funny, though. If I say five grand on Patreon, that's like attainable, but I don't have to do it like tomorrow. That's like the key thing, I think.
So, it's like, it's there to be one.
I'm about to up my pledge.
I was curious, though, along those lines of even conceiving, you know, the idea of myself and Matthew dressed as that character, perhaps like conjoined in one large Mr. X in one big coat. I mean, these are just ideas, Matthew.
Well, that's it. Genuinely, like not to interrupt, but like that's the kind of example of like the cosplay I really love the most is when someone like pushes it a step further to kind of make their own joke. And it's like, what if what if Mr. X was like two people in a trench coat is like objectively brilliant.
And I feel like would be a smash hit. Like I always love that when people kind of push a character like the extra mile and just put that. I'm struggling to think of one off the top of my head I've seen.
But just putting some characters in completely different kind of contexts or like, yeah, it's just so good. So like, I would support this this fresh new twist, this bold new take on Mr. X.
The state of that trench coat after a day in the Excel centre.
Let the trench coat go. Oh my god.
Straight in the fire. That's done for. But I guess along those lines, Jen, is there a cringe barrier to cosplay that you need to push through?
Is that or is that kind of part of the fun?
Yeah, like I think you have to talk about cringe when you talk about cosplay because like it's but it's all kind of weirdly connected to fashion again. It's like we're so self-conscious about like the things that we're wearing on our bodies and that makes me like it's so interesting to me. It's like maybe art is more personal when it's like put on your body and like maybe like your looks are part of it as well.
It's like maybe this particular like kind of self-expression through art just suddenly becomes really quite personal and vulnerable. These are just the weird thoughts I have when I'm like thinking it because I'm like, why is cosplay cringe and why do we kind of cringe at it? And it's like, you're putting a lot of yourself on the line, I think, when you're like dressing up as like a nerdy kind of thing, right?
And attaching your kind of physical self to it. I mean, I'm 32 and like I'm still doing it and people a lot older than me do it. And again, like I just think I've hit this point in life where I'm just not bothered anymore and I'm happy.
I just want to join in with things, I think. Yeah, and it's kind of while you're kind of cringing at certain things sometimes, well, it's mainly people's behaviour that is cringe sometimes at Comic Con. But like other than that, I think seeing people kind of, you know, make these amazing elaborate costumes and the passion that they clearly feel for like a character or a game or a film that they've visibly put so many hours into something, like you could call that cringe.
You could call it cringe being like, why have you spent 50 hours making a Zelda cosplay? Like, don't you have a life? But then it's just like, it's nice to have passions.
I really feel like sometimes being cringe is quite a radical act these days. I do, because I feel like kids trying to reclaim cringe. Yeah, fully, because like kids are growing up on the internet, right?
Where everyone can see what you're doing and judging you constantly. And it must be fucking horrifying. Like if I was when I was a teenager, if my stuff was on the internet, oh my God, like, I mean, I still got an old Tumblr out there that I just grown when I think about it.
But it's like everything is like so looked at these days, right? Like you can't dance badly in a club because someone's going to put a video of you online. It's easier than ever to be marked as like cringe.
And I just feel like it's radical to be like, you know what, I actually don't like if I like this enough to do it, like you just have to be like, you kind of just have to accept that, like accept that that part of you is like, some people might kind of look down on it or something. Yeah, it's a complicated thing. But what's been kind of amazing to see, and I don't know if you're aware of what's been happening here, is that I feel like Dress Up is becoming a little bit less cringe on mass, and specifically through gigs.
Like people are cosplaying for gigs. Have you seen some of this?
No. This is where I feel incredibly out of touch with the modern world.
Okay. Well, like so you know, like the Taylor Swift Errors tour, right? Which is like massive.
It's not so much cosplay, but sometimes people do cosplay like the artists and stuff. But there's a bajillion girls who go to the tour and they're all, you know, it's kind of become the de facto thing to like wear something sparkly and she's got all these errors that are like different colours and stuff, I believe. I don't really know too much about Taylor Swift, but the errors thing and kind of all her amazing kind of branding work around each era of her career, they're all associated with colours and stuff.
And so people kind of dress up as their favourite errors for the tour. Like this is something I see on TikTok. And then I more recently went to a Pitbull show at the O2.
Pitbull, Mr. Worldwide, Mr. Worldwide, Mr. 305. And have you seen just the oceans of women dressing up as Pitbull in bald caps and sunglasses and full suits? You've not seen this?
I have not, no.
Only in my dreams.
Well, actually, I read the most amazing TikTok comment on like one of these videos where like his entire crowd is just women in bald caps and like moustaches and full tuxedos going absolutely apeshit. And there was a comment on TikTok I saw of this and it was like, I have to believe that like one day Pitbull met a genie and he made this wish that he wanted beautiful women all over the world to like be obsessed with him. And the genie had a sense of humour and now they all just show up to his shows dressed exactly like him.
And he's an incredible sport about it and he absolutely loves it and he calls them like the boldies and stuff like that because he's like, yeah, I call you my bold eagles because you're so strong and powerful. And I call you boldies for short because they're all wearing bold caps. I can tell you there's nothing more surreal than being in a sold out O2 arena show with absolutely everybody fully suited up in bold caps.
And I know that the third giant man, Jeremy Peel, actually went to the show. So he's let you down if he's not told you about the Pitbull experience.
Well, yeah, I'll hit Jeremy up about that. We've mostly been talking about Half-Life expansions lately.
You've been wasting your time. You've been wasting your time. But yeah, I just feel like it was also the Barbie movie, right?
I don't know if you saw a bunch of people going to the Barbie movie all dressed in pink, because it was like Barbie Summer and I think a lot of this as well as like a women audience who's really kind of leaned into this as well.
Yeah.
But it does kind of generally feel weirdly in the last, I want to say like three or so years, maybe it's post-pandemic where everyone's just happy to be out again and wants to celebrate and go hard. But everyone's dressing up, everyone's cosplaying Pitbull. And most of them are the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life.
So Pitbull's making cosplay un-cringed, like I'm ready to say it.
Now that you mentioned it, actually, I went to Lana Del Rey about three weeks ago and that was so many girls wearing her white dress from the Loves for Life album cover.
Right.
I mean, I saw thousands of girls dressed almost exactly the same. Right. It was a bit of a shock because I think I thought that because she's been famous for about 13 years, 14 years, that the audience would be mostly my age.
I was in for a shock when it was like 85 percent, I would say, 20 or younger, the audience there. Most of them were young women and most of them were dressed that way. Yeah.
Yeah, it's true. There was a sea of them.
I don't think this happened pre-pandemic. I went to a lot of gigs pre-pandemic as well, and never in my life have I seen, especially mainstream artists like this, where people are like, we're going to cosplay them. It's kind of wild.
So I'm not quite sure what's shifted. And I'm like, I wonder if it's a result of maybe just like inhibitions are slightly lowered after the pandemic, and people are kind of more willing to just kind of, you know, show up in a costume, essentially, kind of publicly, and maybe everyone doing it together again, like Comic-Con gives it kind of more of a kind of acceptability. But it's just a really interesting kind of trend I've seen that I've, yeah, it's been fun to watch and kind of think about how it actually sort of relates to cosplay and to kind of dressing up in general and what we put on.
Yeah, people have uniforms basically kind of for concerts now. And yes, it's amazing to see that kind of spread.
And what about the Randy Newman gigs, Matthew? Are the ladies dressing up as old Randy for those or is that a bit more of a...
Yeah, they're all wearing sort of jumpers that they've probably spilt some beans down or something.
Nice, nice. Authentic. The authentic touch.
I think a good way to wrap up this chat might be to talk about the times that we've either cosplayed or dressed up Jen. Yes. Because I think it's super interesting.
There's a community element to it for sure. There's a self-expression element. I do like the idea as well that pandemic changed thinking because it's a bit like we could die any day so we might as well just do this.
Yeah, like fuck it, yeah.
I would say that's governed a lot of my choices in the past three years. So I totally understand. Yeah, I totally get that.
So Matthew, you dressed up as a Pikmin once. We talked about that in the podcast before. Is there any other times that you've dressed up for various situations?
The Pikmin thing, I wouldn't say it was cosplay. That was an official Pikmin onesie. So right.
Lend an authenticity to it. Was that one of the free ones that kind of just got sent from… Was it Nintendo that sent those along?
Because I remember wearing one at one point. I don't know if it was the same one, which might be…
Probably was. I would say they were designed more for someone of your size than they were of my size, which is why it's such an unflattering photo. That photo of me wearing that onesie, that's why I could never go into politics, because that would just sink me instantly.
If I got anywhere near power, that would be on the front page of the fucking Sun or whatever. And it's like, well, there we go. That was fun when it lasted.
Matthew Castle in Pikmin Scandal.
Yeah, it's horrible. I feel like I've seen it.
I feel like I've seen it.
Yeah, it's terrible.
Was it the blue costume?
I think it was the red one.
Okay. In that case, I don't think we've shared a Pikmin costume, which settles me a little.
This is in Future London as well. For most of the year, it hung on a coat hanger on the wall, because one time Terry Gilliam came in to see Total Film, and as he was walking past, he pointed at a Pikmin onesie and just went, what the hell is that? Which is pretty good going, given that Terry Gilliam makes really fucking weird films.
I like that there was something that was too weird for him. It was the empty skin of a Pikmin.
The pelt of a Pikmin hanging on the wall.
Wow, the mind of Terry Gilliam can't imagine that.
Cannot fathom the horrors. Did you tell him that you hunted it yourself?
No, we wanted to talk to the town.
Okay, fair enough.
I wore that, Terry. Yeah, that didn't come up. I thought at the time I dressed as Rick from The Walking Dead.
I think I looked pretty good when I was like, I think it was just after, it was when The Walking Dead was good. So it's first two seasons basically, and not the remaining nine that they made. But I dressed as him and I was really like, I would say I was fairly sincere about it.
My partner at the time took a few photos, and then one games journalist who will remain unnamed ripped the piss out of it on Facebook, and that was the last time I ever did anything like that.
I'm sorry to hear that. That sucks.
It's a guy who wouldn't do that now, but was in his big, wacky, very online jokester era, and I was clearly just easy material. And so, yeah, that was the one time I did it sincerely, and I was like, ugh. I knew, yeah.
Is it someone who's been a guest on this podcast?
No, no.
I wouldn't put it up as a guest on this podcast. That would be too upsetting to hear.
That would have been ultimate tea. Oh my god. I feel like name it, name it immediately.
Shame.
Yeah, it's someone who might listen to the podcast.
You know who you are.
It's someone who follows the podcast on Blue Sky. So that's narrowing it down. So yeah, there was that time.
I don't know if I've done it. There probably are other times. Oh yeah, I did go to Secret Cinema, Star Wars, which I think I've discussed in the podcast before.
A staggering disappointment. It's just that when I got there, turned around and saw Lando burgers, 10 pounds on a menu. I was like, fuck this shit into the bin.
I was just like, immersion absolutely destroyed.
Oh my god, that sucks.
Yeah, and so I was dressed as like, I would say I had a vague sort of Tatooine moisture farmer aesthetic going on.
Nice, nice.
Yeah, there's a photo of me with Dave Scarborough and Ian Dransfield from Team 17. We're all a bit unconvincing. There are sort of some poncho-esque things going on there, some neckerchief things going on.
It's, yeah, there was that time. But I would say that I never quite break out of the self-conscious aspect of it. But the truth is, if I put the time into it, I think I probably would quite enjoy it.
Yeah, it's just I haven't quite pushed through the cringe barrier. A lot of older millennials were carrying around a lot of like self-consciousness that other generations have defeated, Jen.
Yeah.
And like, we just didn't do it. It didn't happen in our lifetimes, but that's okay.
Yeah.
The next generation, they managed to sort that out, so that's good.
That's it. I think even though I'm like, obviously, a millennial era, I'm also have internet poisoning. So I think I've like picked up kind of bio-osmosis on a lot of kind of Gen Z attitudes, which is probably the most cringe thing I could ever say.
Yeah, I'm telling the kids. But like, it turns out like they kind of know what they're talking about sometimes, not all the time. Stop vaping, you lead addicted weirdos.
But like, you know, like their kind of attitude towards dressing and also kind of just like intensely not giving a fuck to the point where it might be detrimental. But like, it has been like refreshing, kind of has made me feel like I can kind of push myself further with that kind of stuff. Because even like, there's some really interesting articles about like Gen Z fashion and the way that kind of even they approach style and fashion isn't like, well, there's trends, but it's not like, oh, here's my kind of personal aesthetic.
Like a lot of the way that Gen Z dresses, they call it character dressing. They're like, oh, who am I going to be today? I'm going to be a spacefaring cowboy and I'm going to wear pieces from my closet that kind of do that.
Or today I want to feel like a cottage core princess and all the Gen Z words. But it kind of change up their style day to day and kind of how they want to feel and who they want to be on that day. And I've definitely kind of adopted that.
But yeah, I think I've kind of adopted that with cosplay more generally as well, where I always thought as I kind of definitely when I hit, I thought when I hit 30, I'd be like, OK, time to put away the fun things and just commit to becoming your GTA Online gray haired old lady in a T-shirt and jeans. I think it turns out like the older I get, the more I'm like, oh no, I'm going to be a freak forever. So I might as well just like lean into it.
I don't feel any different. It's stuff like when I was younger, I was like, I refused to get a pink DS because I was like, when I'm older, when I'm like ancient, like 25, I'm not going to want pink gadgets anymore because I'll be grown up and I won't be like a little girl anymore. Surprise, surprise.
I think my first time in Tokyo, I went and bought myself a pink DS finally as like a 25 year old. Yeah, I just think like getting older and wiser about the world and stuff and probably more self-conscious as you have kind of negative experiences with people who are also kind of afraid to be who they want to be. I think it can make you worried that like you're just going to kind of trend towards that as you get older.
At least for me, I think I've kind of woken up from that a bit, which very well may mean that I'm going to be cringed for the rest of my life, but I'm going to enjoy it and I'm going to be that bright pink lady running around Guildford probably.
Well, I think you sort of, you know, it certainly doesn't come across as cringe, it just comes across as someone that's, oh, they're someone who has like a basic level of self-confidence.
Oh, I hope so. I hope it just comes across as authentic. Like for a long time, I didn't really know who I was or like who I wanted to be, and I felt weird because I was like, oh, I kind of had an emo phase and I like emo stuff, but I also really love pink and oh, but also really like this and I always felt like a bit lost when I was growing up.
And then just the older you get, the more you kind of understand that you're allowed to be kind of a bunch of different things. So yeah, I think I've just kind of been able to feel better about being more authentic about that. It's probably thanks to the kids who were just on the internet posting everything they ever do and not giving a fuck.
So I'm like in comparison, I'm probably not cringe.
Oh yeah, absolutely. And we settle for being cringe in audio form on this podcast.
Yeah.
So that's absolutely fine. GameScore is our version of cringe, so that's okay. So that's awesome, Jen.
Is there anything else you want to say on this subject before I ask you about some games you've been playing lately because I feel like we've covered a broad array of stuff there and it's super interesting to dig into this. Talked about a lot of interesting games in the midst of that as well. But anything else you want to say on this subject about, I guess, from the perspective of middle of the road blokes, why this kind of expression is exciting or that kind of thing?
Yeah. Hopefully, you guys and anyone listening is getting my point. I think just the overall thesis I've been thinking about lately is just how interesting and personal and deep this stuff is, even though people hear fashion and style and just think that's for girls and it's superficial and why would you spend time thinking about how you look so much and it can come off quite self-absorbed.
But I hope we've covered some stuff here that helps people think about how rich this is, and specifically indie game developers. If there's indie games developers out there who are like, oh yeah, actually, there's a lot of narrative and social and systemic depth to this. Please make more dress up games.
It's such a small genre, I feel like, compared to everything else. I just would love to play more. I'm open to having a chat if you ever want some thoughts from someone who's played a bunch of these kinds of games.
Yeah, I just want to play more of them. There's someone who I met via a friend at Amaze Berlin this year, who is making a dress up game on itch. I think the demo is due to come out soon.
It's a game where you dress up inanimate objects, so like martini glasses and phones and stuff like that, and you're dressing them up, which seems like a mad concept, both symbolically and technically. It's like, how are you putting a sweater on a martini glass? I don't know.
I can't wait to find out and have a go on that, but I've been chatting a little bit in DMs, the dev of that. And yeah, I just, I hope we get some more stuff in this genre because I feel like there's depths to be plumbed. I think that's kind of my sum up.
And yeah, and I think it's also important to say that like, fashion is such a reflection of the world that we're in. And like fashion has got quite conservative and like trend focused and like, you know, we're in kind of a great depression at the moment. Like people are growing out their hair because they can't afford to like diet anymore.
And it's such an interesting time. So to me at the moment, I think expressing yourself as an individual feels even more kind of important and relevant and yeah, you should think about doing it and just kind of making the world more colourful and kind of upkeeping whatever you want to say with kind of what you wear outside if you can and it's safe for you because yeah, I feel like it you're kind of fighting a kind of broader trend of being dampened down. So you know, shout out to people that have the courage to do that.
Yeah, I'm just inspired by it a lot.
Oh, that's awesome. Next time Matthew sees me, I'll be rocking the Paul Mescal mullet, looking like a commentator on horse racing on channel four, no doubt with that look. But that's awesome, Jen.
I'd love to hear more about if you get the name of that game as well. I'll link that in the show notes.
Yes, I will find it shortly before we hang up the call and I'll get that over to you because hopefully the demo is out soon. I think she said it was coming soon.
Awesome. So before we wrap up, I did want to hear about some of the games you've been enjoying in the past year or so, like just things in your spare time, maybe not even necessarily driven by things you've had to play for work, or for the articles you've been writing. What have you been playing lately?
Yeah, I mean, for my sins, I've been playing a lot of Infinity Nikki, which is the latest Love Nikki game, which is in the middle of pissing off its entire fan base for really complicated reasons I won't go into. But it is a fabulous dress up game, the 3D kind of open world dress up game, which works surprisingly well mostly when they're not messing it up. It just allows you a lot of creative freedom to kind of make kind of infinite different outfits.
I'm absolutely loving that as kind of a bit more of a like turn my brain off game. It's not anywhere near as kind of like subversive and weird in its stories as the other games, which is sad, but the dress up element of it I've absolutely loved and it is like relentlessly girly, which also feels quite radical. It's kind of like a Barbie game evolved really.
So I've been really enjoying just fully leaning into that non-self consciously. I've actually gone back to my 3DS in quite a big way. Attack of the Friday Monsters has appeared.
Guess I'll play it, which I did for the first time. It was absolutely brilliant. I played that recently.
Have either of you played that?
Yeah, awesome game. One of the few true 3DS deep cuts, really. There's not that many of them in the library because the library is not that big, but definitely on the download game side.
Yes. Oh my God. It's brilliant.
I didn't understand that it was even though it's called Attack of the Friday Monsters. I didn't quite know how magical realism it was going to get. So that was amazing.
It just looks incredible still. All those hand-drawn backgrounds are just absolutely unbelievable. And I feel like it's been really hot lately.
So I feel like it's kind of been the perfect summer game, just kind of pootling about catching bugs and playing what I can only describe as I think like top trumps sort of the card game. It's a bit thin, but it's fun. So that's been amazing.
And then also, I went to a maze actually this year and played the demo for a game called Some Goodbyes We Made, which is now out on Steam for like a few quid. And I've just been blown away by that. So the best way to describe it is probably like what remains of Edith Finch crossed with Florence.
Basically, it's a very personal game by this person who's kind of recounting a series of different goodbyes that they've had to say. And each one of them is kind of like a little, what would you call, like vignette. Like in Edith Finch, where it's kind of each member of the family kind of has their own kind of interactive, playable sequence, right?
That's kind of about their story. So yeah, it's kind of a series of like interactive vignettes about like different kind of real world based goodbyes that this person has had to say. And it's it kind of it has that beautiful like hand drawn kind of 2D Florence adjacent art style.
Some of the mechanical storytelling, I mean, almost all of it is absolutely amazing, like on a par with Edith Finch, like I think, which is high praise. But I do think like the way that it uses some mechanics to just really quickly and efficiently tell incredibly emotive stories is sensational. So I massively appreciate that.
There's one like kind of vignette that's about them saying, like waving goodbye to their dad on the train and kind of recalling how their dad would play this game where they're kind of following their wave exactly the whole way and they don't stop until you stop. And the way that's kind of handled mechanically and the emotions you go through are unbelievable. There's one on a plane where they're kind of leaving their home country and all their memories behind and they're kind of rushing past and the way it kind of suddenly shifts from becoming like a really sweet memory lane and interaction experience that you can actually partake in to suddenly it's all kind of going too fast and the tone changes and you're suddenly sort of not able to interact like you were with these kind of memories that you're leaving behind as the plane takes off.
Oh my god, it's like, please, it's like four quid or something. You just have to check it out if you're kind of like an indie story head and you're really interested in just really elegant mechanical storytelling. A lot of it is without words, but it just makes you feel like real big feelings.
Sounds great.
Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, and I don't think it's been on many radars because it's a very kind of tiny kind of indie team. But that's the beauty of Amaze.
Every year I go, I just play these absolutely kind of blindsiding, small experiences that are really amazing. So yeah, that's like a few things I've been into lately. Yeah, some old stuff, some new stuff.
Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, some great recommendations there. And yeah, honestly, a delight to have you back on the podcast, Jen.
So thank you so much for taking the time and for bringing such detailed thoughts on this subject because it was super fun to discuss. It got some really good anecdotes out of us. And yeah, it was just a delight having you.
So thank you so much for taking the time. We appreciate it.
Thank you so much for having me. And thank you for genuinely being a little bit vulnerable and also being hilarious. It's great.
I really hope this is a sort of topic where it would kind of bring up a whole range of stuff. And I really think it did. So thank you for being so up for it.
Because obviously, like you said, it's kind of out of your comfort zone. But thanks for taking it seriously, I guess. Because there's plenty of people out there that kind of dismiss an idea like this of like, why would you want to kind of talk about this stuff?
So yeah, thanks for being open to it and joining in. It's been so fun.
Yeah, no worries. I'm going to be taking a screenshot of Matthew's Dragon Age Inquisition character to the barb and myself and being like, can you give me a Sylveon, please?
Give me the Sylveon. It's going to be the hot new thing.
I think I can pull off the Sylveon. Okay, that's awesome. Where can people get you on social media, Jen?
What a question. I am on Blue Sky at the moment. It's Jen Simpkins, which used to be my Twitter thing, not on Twitter anymore for obvious reasons, hopefully obvious reasons.
I don't love social media. I might not be on there for very much longer, which is really annoying. But I was thinking the other day about maybe setting up a personal website, a blog.
There's a developer I really admire called V. Buckenham, who made the Downpour game engine. They're an indie game developer.
They have a personal blog that they're posting their thoughts to Blue Sky via it. I was like, oh yeah, do you know what? I need a website.
Let's return to a website. So I'm on Blue Sky for now. I think you can get to my itch profile from there if you want to play in my shitty little bits of games that I make, but yeah, might make websites soon.
So watch out for some crazy HTML action. I might return to the blog.
Oh yeah, media big time being decentralised at the moment, so launching a website sounds about right in 2025. We'll link it in the newsletter if you do go ahead with it Jen, so we can send our listeners your way. Yeah, thank you so much for taking the time.
Matthew, where can people get you on social media?
I am at MrBazzlePesto on Blue Sky and occasionally Letterboxd.
Absolutely. I'm Samuel W. Roberts on both of those.
If you like the podcast and want to support us, patreon.com/backpagepod. We're Back PagePod on Twitter and Blue Sky as well. Thank you so much Jen for the idea for this episode.
It's been super fun and catch you later. Goodbye.
Bye. Goodbye.
