Hello and welcome to The Back Page Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how's it going? You're at the end of your fabled week off. Have you completed Zelda?
How much of Zelda have you played? How are things going?
I haven't completed it. I've done two dungeons. I've been pootling around.
I've got 86 shrines. That's what I've been doing, shrines. I've been doing a lot of building.
There's a big building side quest in the game that I've been enjoying. I've finally reached a point where I can explore more of the skies. I've got the know-how and the vehicle parts to get further afield.
So, yeah, it's kind of... Certainly we mentioned in the Zelda episode, but it's kind of interesting how exploring in one realm kind of helps you go further in a different realm in that game and they all kind of feed into each other. Yeah, I'm having a good time with it.
Interesting, yes. That podcast generated quite a lot of discussion, didn't it? That was surprising to see.
I suppose the question to ask is, are we okay after the whole Zelda thing, Matthew?
I don't think the whole Zelda thing is that much of a thing, all told. Wherever you end up landing on Tears of the Kingdom, it'll be fine, because I really love it. I think it's great.
There are games where, if you weren't into it, I might question what I think about it. I might be like, hmm, I wasn't completely made up. This one, I am confident this is a truly great game, and nothing can sway me from that.
Would I go as far to say that I pity people who don't enjoy it? Maybe.
Oh, dear. Yeah, it's funny because I have played a fair chunk more of it since we did that episode. I think about probably about six hours more than that, and I have reached a point now where I'm sort of like ignoring the building for the time being, and just doing the quest stuff.
And I think that I'm enjoying it a bit more there. I think one thing I definitely agree with that people have been raising is the idea that the shrines are a better sort of format for the sort of chaotic puzzle-solving element than the open world is where building stuff feels a bit more functional and building bad cars or bad airplanes or whatever. I think that in the very specific circumstance of the shrines where you are given the parts to solve a particular puzzle and it's down to you to figure out how to do it, I think it really shines as a system.
And then when I get into the open world, I'm not that interested in building stuff, so I just kind of go around in the traditional Zelda way and the game seems to be mostly fine with me doing that. So that's good. And then only occasionally engaging with the building when I want to.
I'm sure at some point the game will demand that I do more of it. But for the time being, it seems pretty lean.
I basically build planes up in the sky and I build stuff where there feels like there's a puzzle solution. You know, like the game has a habit of putting a cluster of things which suggest an obvious build near like enemy encampments or near the Koroks or whatever. But like there's also you get those sort of supply dumps all across the world where every 200 meters or so you'll probably find a little stand which has got some planks, some wheels and whatever.
I'm not building cars there, like I don't build a lot of cars unless I'm on like literally the top of a hill. My favorite little thing to build is... I can't remember what they're called, but there are these little like flat things with wheels on them already.
I think you're meant to put the gliders on them to kind of go down ramps.
Right.
But if you stick a steering stick or a control stick or whatever they're called on top of one of those little wheelie trays, that's just like a little like mobility scooter. I like to take those down hills really fast because I don't have to build anything other than combine two things together.
That's good. Your dream transportation method in Bath come to life in Tears of the Kingdom.
Well, I've been like almost knocked out by so many of those fuckers on their little orange scooters, which are they meant to be on the road? Are they meant to be on the pavement? No one really knows, but no such worries in Hyrule.
Oh, people look so fucking smug on those things as well. They're like, I'm on a scooter. They got that kind of expression about them.
And you're like, I just want to clothesline you like I'm in Bully or something like that.
I'm on a scooter.
But there's a lot of that going on. Do you notice that too? People are looking around like, I'm on a scooter.
You're not on a scooter. That kind of expression. There's a lot of that going on.
Because they conk out at a certain point, right? Because they've got something in built and then to stop them from you just like nicking them and driving them out of town.
If you had Bristol or whatever.
But it means you can see where they, they basically conk out at the bottom of our road. Because there's always loads of scooters left there. You can sort of see like the radius of the scooters from where they're left.
It's quite good environmental storytelling actually.
Yeah, it does have a bit of a sort of like late stage capitalism dystopia vibe to them. When you see them, their little lights kind of like fading in and out at night time. When you're going for a walk, you're like, oh, okay.
This is like, like you say, good world building, you know? I feel very immersed by reality right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, good. Yeah, I can see the sort of parallels you've drawn there.
Yeah, so Zelda, Bath, Tic Tic.
Yeah, done that. And now onto another bit of bullshit that this podcast is synonymous with, Games Court. So this is the only podcast format too inane to be replicated by an AI.
No AI no matter how well trained can reproduce this drivel on command. So that I think that makes us safe from the oncoming revolution of billionaires bankrupting regular people so they can just serve content, et cetera. So, you know, we're insulated by how terrible these podcasts are.
Good stuff. So Games Court, for people who don't know then, oh, how to describe it. So years ago, about two years ago, I guess, we did an episode where I audited all of these eBay purchasers by having Matthew judge whether they were good or not.
And I decided they were not good pre-owned purchasers, you know, your kind of DS games and the like, bought for eight to 12 quid during the pandemic, just before prices really, really skyrocketed on some of these games. I would be put to death. And we did that, I think, like a couple of times.
And then we decided to turn it to listeners because that seemed like a fun, natural evolution of it. At the first time we did it, I don't think we were confident we had enough listeners to even bother with it. But now people seem to very much enjoy the Games Court format.
We put listeners on trial. We decide whether they're guilty or innocent. And then we, if they are considered guilty, there's some kind of comedy execution waiting for them at the end of it, at the behest of one judge, Matthew Castle.
So it's sort of endured as a format. And it's been a little while since we've done one now, about five months. So we are due a new Games Court.
And we've got about, I think like 15 entries here to go through from the listeners. Matthew, how are you feeling about coming back to Games Court? I feel like you resent this even more than I do.
It's always a bit nerve wracking because people do like these episodes, but we have no idea how they're going to go until we're in the moment. And there's always the risk of trying to kind of recreate something that was quite spontaneous and fun. That's worry one.
Worry two is that anyone hopes this has like nutritional value and that they're going to hear some like deep analysis of quite a random selection of games, which I haven't seen. I have cast a very quick eye over just to make sure there wasn't anything too scary. But a lot of these games, like I haven't played or I don't have an opinion on, I definitely don't know how much they're worth, traditionally worth in trade ins, which is the whole concept of this episode.
So just to reinforce really how hollow this exercise is, we're going to talk about a lot of games I don't know about. We're going to talk about prices, which I definitely don't know. But it'll be fun.
It's just fun to hear people, you know, what they've been up to and are more interested in it. Not necessarily the complex life stories behind these purchases, but the kind of imagining the mindset of someone who felt that they had to buy The Wheelman 10 years on. Like that's fascinating to me.
That's the stuff that gets my juices flowing for sure. They're like, I just bought Golden Compass on 360 and then I'm like, you know, rubbing my knees at the prospect of it. So, yes, it's that kind of bullshit we like to litigate.
And so like Matthew says, we do not consider ourselves authorities on, you know, auction prices for games, going prices for retro games. We are not claiming that. It's simply some whims on the part of two people who are half informed.
So that's a real gut feel stuff on this.
Definitely. Yes. And then I also to kind of also complete the, you know, the sort of like format of how we do this.
I am the the basically the defendant's representative in court, a better call Saul type Jimmy McGill figure, who often conspires with the court to have my own clients killed, because I feel that's important for a bit for justice. Like my I'm there to represent the clients, but also justice, what I consider justice is important to me too. So sometimes I'll be like, no, I think this guy should die and then Matthew be like, OK, then and then we'll either drown them or send them to Lord Brisby or whatever, you know, like lots of fun.
Evil fates have awaited these these listeners. So first of all, we start with the world building the deep law. So for people who haven't listened to these episodes before, there is a fictional island, a place beyond space and time called Matthew Castle Island.
That is where these trials take place. And it has been established as being a kind of like Colonel Kurtz run island nation type deal, sort of like budget North Korea, basically. Just to get that out there.
Yeah, Matthew, what's new on Castle Island these days? Well, not days as such, because that will be a measurement of time. And as listeners know, time is banned on Matthew Castle Island.
So what's been going down there?
And the internet.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Those are the two facts you need to bear in mind for the next one minute. Well I've been quite jealous of the Cannes Film Festival. So I've decided to launch my own film festival, but it only shows South Korean films where people get wrecked with hammers.
Every film ends with a standing ovation that lasts, well, and who can tell? That's right, that's one.
Yeah, good, good. Joke number one takes...
There are five jokes. Here's the second.
Yeah, I think Jerry Seinfeld does this before every second. There are 26 jokes. Let's begin.
The film festival is opening with Oppenheimer, the Odeon bath audio cut, which of course has no soundtrack, no special effects. It will be the first Christopher Nolan film that anyone can understand. That's joke number two.
Yep, ticked. Yep, good.
Yep. What else is going on on Castle Island? Oh, well, Matthew Castle Island Competition and Markets Authorities decided to block the Microsoft and Activision merger on the ground so that it would lead to Crash Bandicoot being readily available on Games Pass and the world don't need that shit.
I did have a long bit about how I was trying to buy Sing and that the CMA blocked it just because it just wasn't worth anyone's time.
Also Sing closed years ago, but again, you wouldn't recognise out on Castle Island.
It didn't make any sense, even by the logic of this terrible bit. Obviously at the moment, Zelda, massive on the world stage. It's called Tears of the Kingdom.
That's what I bathe in every night. Want internet access? Cry more, losers.
OK, good. Is that the world building complete? Are we done?
Last bit.
Yes. Last joke.
Of course, I shouldn't be too blasé about mistreating the people of my island. Playing Zelda, it's actually been sort of fermenting a bit of unrest in the local citizens. There's a prophecy on our island too, that I too can be brought down if you unite the power of six sages.
So islanders are currently looking for the Sage of Fire, the Sage of Water, the Sage of Wind, the Sage of Lightning, the Sage of Spirit, and the Sage of Time. Good luck with that last one, that's it.
Okay good, yeah, round of applause there, it's just you know, the world building has come. That's the joke.
I saw the word time and went, yep, there's something in that.
Yeah, that's good. I've got a bit of Tears of the Kingdom in my bits, so I'm excited about that. So okay, so who's in the courtroom today?
Normally we, even though this is a sort of like autocratic sort of courtroom, the judge decides all, for set dressing we often have like a jury of sorts to give it a bit of colour. So who's in the courtroom today, Matthew?
We've got Turgle from Jedi Survivor, but his skin texture hasn't properly rendered in.
Even with his skin texture he's quite cursed looking to be honest.
So that's rough. We've got a Thomas the Tank Engine that someone's modded into the courtroom. We've got a Gollum from the Upcoming Gollum Game, but we didn't pay for his emotes DLC so he comes with none of his iconic gestures or sayings.
We've got a Doctor Salvador from Resi 4 Remake AND a Doctor Salvador from Original Resi 4. They're separated with a divider, so they don't see each other and wig out.
I question his medical credentials, Doctor Salvador, that's all I'm saying, y'know. I'm just not convinced there's a degree behind that title, but yeah.
I do wonder about what Doctor Salvador does the rest of the time, because you know the village siege at the start? After a certain amount of time, he's like, I'm coming in, and that suggests this whole time he's just been standing on the other side of the gate, like, waiting for it to kick off. Yeah.
Like, because the villagers, if you watch them from afar, they're kind of like, some of them are carrying hay and, like, when I was looking at a chicken and some of them are putting a policeman on a steak. They have, like, purpose in their lives. It's quite hard to imagine what the routine of Dr. Salvador is.
Yeah, is he cutting, like, wood down, maybe? Or, like, cutting trees down? Or, the bag over his head is the confusing factor, because that would suggest, you know, that doesn't cover the eyes if you're doing a bit of sawing, so, uh, anyways.
Um, yeah, I don't know. It's unclear again, though. The doctor part is the thing I'm the most curious about, like, where did that come from?
Who conferred that upon him? Et cetera.
So, maybe just by the standards of the village, he's the closest thing they have. You know, he can use an implement. And so, he is like, he may as well be the doctor.
Yeah, the rest of them could only throw little axes and explosives, but he can actually, like, you know, use two arms to do things. That's like, good for him, you know.
So, and everyone knows the doctors are the most capable amongst us, so. Uh, who else have we got in the courtroom? Uh, we've got Addison, who's the guy who holds up the the unbalanced signs in Tears of the Kingdom.
Right.
But no one is engaging with him, because frankly, we're sick of the rice balls he keeps giving us, so we're just not going to help him.
What does the, uh, the signs say? Anything funny, like, uh, execute the listeners or anything like that?
Uh, yeah, sure, why not? Yeah, that sounds about right. Also from Tears of the Kingdom, we have incredibly hench Ganondorf from the past, but let me remind the court that being performatively horny is banned on Castle Island.
We respect Ganondorf for his military achievements, not his abs.
Okay, good. Yeah, big, uh, Europe in the 1930s diplomatic energy there. Very good.
Yes. Um, that's who I got.
Okay, good. That's a solid line up. I enjoyed that.
That was, you know, the idea of two Dr. Salvador's is, uh, is curious to me. I do think at one point when they properly clock each other, we're going to have some problems, but, uh, that's not for me to worry about. Okay, the last piece of the puzzle here, Matthew.
How are we going to execute the listeners today if found guilty?
Inspired by Zelda, I've managed to develop my own version of the Ultra Hand. So I've got an Ultra Hand and a huge pile of crap that I'm going to attach to people.
Right.
Now, some of you might become majestic gliders with sound aerodynamic thinking. Others will just have a plank coming out of their head at a weird angle because I couldn't figure out the rotation controls. Ha ha ha ha!
Uh, and to those who nervously anticipate this fate, I say this, fear is just a construct of a mind, and soon you'll be a construct of my mind.
That's good. That's good. So people don't know exactly what's going to happen to them as such.
I've got a pile of stuff. I'm just going to attach stuff to people and see what happens.
I've put four wheels on you. You are now a car, et cetera. And then I'm going to wheel you into the ocean.
You're now my special car, like my version of the Pope Mobile. Ha ha ha ha! I'm going to drive you all around town saying, this person bought a bad game.
That's good. Yeah. The Castle Cadillac or something.
You know, some kind of like name like that with a bit of an iteration. Okay, good. All right.
Well, lots to pass there. So listeners, I fear not because you have me, the third best attorney on Matthew Castle Island to help bail you out of it. So I have prepared a speech here.
I often do give a speech beforehand. I'm not sure if real lawyers do this, I haven't been to a court case.
Traditionally, these speeches seem designed to like rile me up, which is not like the best tactic for a lawyer.
I mean, you say that, I've done that again here exactly. So there's been no change.
This is a courtroom, it's not the roast of Judge Castle.
Yeah, so that's kind of fair. But again, I think the roasting is part of why we're here. I like to create a bit of tension because I think we need a bit of antagonism between us in order to create the necessary games court drama.
So there's a bit of that behind it. Plus I just like writing speeches to be honest, that's a real reason. Okay, ladies, gentlemen, Wario's and war criminals in the courtroom, brackets.
This is before I knew there was no Wario in this courtroom.
Wario is probably here.
Okay, I think he is a resident on this island. There has historically been a Wario or two knocking about in these courtrooms.
He's the court stenographer.
Yeah, a really important role and a highly paid role. What is your currency here again? I don't remember.
Well, it changes based on what I'm currently into. So obviously, it's rupees at the moment.
Okay, good. That ties in well with something I've got coming up. So I'll continue with the speech now.
It's like you go joke number two. I'm doing it the same with the speech. Today, we once again welcome a cavalcade of dweebs into the courtroom.
Their only crime, making rash buying decisions on eBay. Who among us hasn't accidentally slipped and pressed buy it now on a 7 out of 10 Suda51 game from 2011, or dropped £86.99 on a copy of Glass Rose for PS2 because some ne'er-do-well picked it in a Capcom games draft? Who hasn't burned £300 of ill-gotten games on Steel Battalion where they don't even own the flat they're storing it in?
Judge Castle has installed himself as Judge, Jury and Executioner on this island, though often he'll outsource that last bit to Michael Cain. I ask you, however, can we trust this brutish warlord, who reportedly strapped Zonai devices to his servants when they overcook his Tesco pizzas, sending them floating into oblivion while he lectures them on what a good crafting system it is that Nintendo has built? Can we trust a man whose island compound is a replica of the hotel in Hotel Dusk, except it contains the drowned bodies of Games Court victims passed in various tanks?
And should we believe in the integrity of a judge, who tried to submit a freelance pitch to the Lucky Clover Gazette only to demand a hundred rupees per word, then later learn it was a fictional publication? This man is nothing but an Aldi Kim Jong-un, problematic, frequently rumoured to have died, but ultimately a cheap imitation. Let's not punish these lads just because they bought a PSP RPG or two that IGN gave a 6 out of 10.
Let's punish them for their actual crimes, like joining the Back Page Discord and being part of our community.
I feel sufficiently riled up. I'm ready to attach some things to some boys. Let's do it.
That's good. I like how we're in the same headspace for this. It's like, well, I'm playing this one game, so I'll make jokes about this one game.
Okay, exhibit A.
He's often rumoured to be dead.
Wasn't he rumoured to have died, Kim Jong-un?
He's meant to have everything. Isn't he just more gout of a man at this point?
Same, brother. High five.
Do you also see him at Pure Gym?
No, I don't. I don't see that in my guy doing crunches, do you know what I mean? Or the Chris Hemsworth ropes, as I refer to them.
These cables that you see little lads running away with, and they look really stressed when they're doing it. They'll sort of grab a cable, then start running with it, and I've no idea what the fuck that machine is, but they are giving it their all. There's a lot of tentative-looking lads in the gym.
There's tentative-looking lads, like incredibly stacked bros, and me right in the middle, basically. That's like the clientele there.
It could go either way.
Yeah, exactly. Exhibit A. Good morning, gentlemen.
If it pleases the court, I would like to humbly submit some recent CX boot fair and charity shop purchases for judgment. I'm going to resist the powerful urge to try and justify my predilection for obscure and almost certainly terrible PS3 titles, and have simply instead provided the titles and their cost to avoid of any other mitigating context. Well, that's not true, because there's this whole fucking paragraph I just read out.
But anyway, may the learned judge have mercy upon my wretched soul. Okay, we start with probably the most interesting one here, Matthew. You've got G Darius.
This is from Koig.
Interesting.
It's G Darius on PS1. Are you aware of this game?
I know the Darius series, maybe not this specific entry.
Yeah, so it's like a Tato sort of shooter series. This one costs 26.95 on PS1. There's Ultimate Action Triple Pack on PS3, which includes Just Cause 2, Tomb Raider and Sleeping Dogs.
All solid games, if you ask me. There are 16 times official Dreamcast Magazine demo discs with their cases at artwork. 21.70 pounds.
Child of Eden, PS3, for 1.50 pounds. Nothing wrong with that. They should fucking put that on Quest 2 so I can enjoy it at home in my VR headset.
Virtual Tennis 2009, PS3, that's 1 pound. Wanted Weapons of Freight on PS3, 4 pounds, very 5 out of 10, 3rd person shooter, if I recall correctly. Mindjack on PS3, 1 pound 50.
Mindjack.
This is an obscure square enix thing. I don't remember that well. I don't think it was very well reviewed.
Stormrise PS3, 1 pound, that was like a creative assembly thing from a long time ago. Timeshift on PS3, 1 pound 50, which has Greg Grunberg in it, Matthew, so consider that in your judgment. He is the voice actor in that game, important there.
Side note, by the way. The other day, I realized I had four pictures of Ron Rifkin saved on my work desktop, and I thought, I'm the only person in the world who has four pictures of Ron Rifkin saved on their computer, other than maybe Ron Rifkin.
Was that because you made him into a custom background to your desktop?
Yeah, but I've got one of him on each monitor, so I've got an alias on one of them. I've got Kevin Costner's Dragonfly on another one, etc. I can't name two other Ron Rifkin projects, to be honest, but I respect his work.
Vin Diesel's Wheelman, PS3, £1.50. Black Sight Area 51, a Harvey Smith game, PS3, £1.50. The Occupation on PS4, which is £8, quite a mix there.
I think probably the thing to discuss here, Matthew, other than Wheelman, as you mentioned, is a classic games court entry in a lot of ways, because it's a bit six or seven out of 10. It has Vin Diesel in it. It's funny to discuss, but was actually considered quite a solid game.
The Dreamcast demo discs feel like the one to me that I'm most likely to get this guy executed. What do you think?
Everyone knows that we're not big Dreamcast heads, and when anyone brings up Dreamcast, it makes me feel bad about myself, which is a feeling I like to feel.
Why you feel bad about yourself?
Well, because I don't know about it. It's sort of like an embarrassing hole in my knowledge. I don't like to be reminded of this.
Because the thing is, this is the one point where if we jokingly go boo Dreamcast, the Dreamcast people online are just the fucking worst. Because they want you to think that they're all chilled and blue skies and all this kind of shit. But actually, they're really, really pernickety about their hobby.
And they're very like, you don't know about Dreamcast? And I'm like, I haven't really got a lot of time for that.
There's a lot of Yushin Aka energy from these people, Matthew.
Yeah, that's the thing. They're kind of like acolytes of the Naka.
I don't know. I mean, there's too many six out of tens that are gonna be sort of lost to time there to be truly down on this selection of things. Really, the most egregious part of this application is that Koyg was super down on Foundation on Discord, and I liked Foundation on Apple TV.
Apple TV is really going for it with sci-fi, isn't it? It's like actually investing in it. Original, well, I suppose it's based on something, but you know, it's not fucking Star Wars or Star Trek, basically.
But this isn't sniffy TV opinion court, so...
Oh, no one would survive that in our Discord.
Honestly, there are certain names that when I hear in this episode, I'm instantly eyeing up, attaching a TNT barrel to someone's head, just because they've laid into something that I like on Discord, but I've got to be above that. I've got to be better than that.
Can I also just go to back for the demo disc thing a little bit, in the sense that I think that there's a certain nostalgia tied to demo disc that isn't really relatable to any other type of game's nostalgia. There's something about, what I remember in my early days of only a PS2, the thing I do remember hearing a lot was the official PS2 magazine demo disc music, which is.
Like, and then I'd play like Tarzan, Free Ride or Hurdy Gurdy or Ico or Smackdown 2001 or whatever.
What a bleak picture you paint.
Well, no, it was good because it was like, the demo disc was a portal to a load of other stuff. I guess you could argue as well that if you're a retro collector, having the demo disc lets you explore avenues, lets you play games you might not have played otherwise. You could just emulate them.
Although again, that's like, you'd have to own the games originally to do that legally.
I'm pretty sure they say not for resale on them.
That's very true.
If I'm thinking about my loyalty to my former employer, you should not really be selling those demo discs.
Was that a future mag, the official Dreamcast mag? I have no idea.
No, that's the thing. It's a big blind spot for me, Dreamcast. I feel like there's just too much shit that we kind of don't mind.
Yeah, I think it just about evens out, this one. Like, there's stuff like Stormrise, Black Sight, no.
It's almost too perfect a collection of games. It's almost like bait, Back Page bait, you know?
Yeah, G Darius is an interesting pick as well. Like, a side-scrolling shooter, PS1, like, arcade port, never ported anywhere else. That being the, like, expensive one here, kind of makes sense.
And none of the, apart from the demo discs, none of the prices are that outrageous to me. Like, they're all, like, two pound or less. That's pretty harmless, I think, apart from wanted weapons of fate of four pounds.
But even so, it's not like you pay 20 quid for it, you know?
How about this? We say not guilty, but I attach a hot air balloon and a flame emitter to the demo discs so that they just float up into space and we never have to think about them again.
Okay, sounds good. They'll burn up in orbit and that'll be fine.
Yeah, and that's it. And then we just don't have to think about it, which is really the best way of dealing with Dreamcast, I find.
Okay, so there you go, Quake. In real life, now you have to get rid of your demo discs and some kind of air balloon and that way you will be spared. So good luck with that.
And I can feel a little bit better about myself.
Which is obviously the real goal of this court. Yeah, The Occupation is kind of an interesting game. That's sort of like a fixed time immersive narrative thing.
I feel like it was slightly underplayed, but it looked quite cool. You aware of this game, Matthew?
It's just like PS4 gen, right?
Yeah, it's like the developers made Aether 1 before this, which is a well-regarded sort of point and click kind of game.
It was a no from me, dog. I tried it and didn't like it.
They're an interesting dev. They seem to make super specific stuff. They're called White Paper Games, I think.
I think a law is going to be passed in this game, and then there's a certain amount of time to find evidence to get it repealed or something. That's a super interesting idea.
I don't want to be encouraging that kind of thing.
No, because it will go against you on Castle Island.
No, no, no.
Okay, next up then, Exhibit B. Sorry, that's innocent, so I'll just type that in. Innocent, but going up in a balloon.
Good. Exhibit B. Discworld, PS1, 45 pounds, fully intending to play through, almost definitely with a guide, as I recall it, being unbelievably random, and revel in the fabulous 90s legends voice cast, John Pertwee, Tony Robinson, Eric Idle, et cetera, and wonderful writing, that's from Jimball.
Interesting one, Matthew, because you've talked about Discworld before. Discworld Noir, I'm guessing this is right, that has to be, because it's on PS1.
It might just be Discworld 1.
Oh, OK, is it like the same cast in each one? I don't know much about this series.
Yeah, they have the same people in a lot of these things. Rob Brydon is in loads of these games.
Good for him, make that money, Rob.
It's pre- when Rob Brydon became a thing, I remember thinking, oh, like from the Discord games.
Oh, interesting, so that's your main way into the trip, then. What if the guy from the Discord games and Alan Partridge went on holiday?
Imagine if you read that right up.
Very specific.
There's not enough Discord jokes in the trip, given his career.
Was that, yeah, that was your review for Total Film, and it was like, yeah, very confusing for the PR reading that. Yeah, £45, that's quite a lot of money. I get the sense, though, that like, that's probably what it's worth.
It's a slightly odd type of game to be on PS1, and hasn't played it, which is often not good with this judge.
The idea that I had to spend this because I had to play it, and the fact that you haven't played it shows the passion isn't there. Did I love these games when I was younger? I was obsessed with them.
I really, really wanted them, and I bought them, I played them and famously went to a stranger's house to ask them to borrow their guide. I tracked someone down in the phone book, who I overheard at a Terry Pratchett signing, had a copy of the walkthrough and stalked him. And this was like pre-inter...
This stuff was much harder to do. It fills me with fear the idea of ever having to go back and replay these games because they were full of just absolute bollocks logic. It was just nonsense.
It really tapped into the weird and wonderful world of Discworld, but in doing so was just quite a hard and unsatisfying point-and-click game to play. The rules of the world are kind of like... You're not trying to think of what makes sense.
You're trying to think of what would the punchline be? What would be the goofy twist on this solution? Which is actually quite an unsatisfying way of building a puzzle in a point-and-click game, I think.
45 quid for something you haven't played.
That is about what it's worth. I had a quick look in the background there. This is the going price for it on PS1.
This is the going price for it. But it didn't play it. It's not just the value.
It's the point of buying it. Yeah.
We need a bit of drama on this podcast. Kill the guy.
Yeah. No, it's a no from me, doll. In traditional court parlance.
Okay. How are they dying, Matthew?
How are they dying? I mean, let's just go for the classic. I'm just going to attach a shitload of rockets, because that's what a lot of people do in Tears of the Kingdom, because everyone knows how a rocket works.
I'm hitting those rockets. He's going up out of sight, out of mind. No, he's come back down.
He's smashed all over the courtroom. Very much back in sight, back in mind. It's horrific, but I stand by it.
Okay, good. And the barrier between the two Dr. Salvador has shattered as the rockets collide into the ground. Who knows what happens next?
That's intimidating. Some quite short ones this time, Matthew. People have been listening to your complaints on previous episodes.
Oh, good.
Yeah. You ready for the next one?
Yeah.
Not the juiciest of submissions. Great way to fucking start, isn't it? Because there are no games attached.
But I just bought this used new 3DS XL off eBay for 135 euros. I hassled down the seller from 160. This is despite already owning a normal 3DS XL.
The good part is that this white version was never sold in North America. The bad news is that since I'm living in Germany, it isn't compatible with my...
I can't track this story. There was the euros, there was North America, he's in... What's going on?
Yeah, the narrative is all over the place. It's like fucking Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3. So that's a really specific reference, but I've just been listening to a podcast about how fractured the narrative is in that film, and it's now embedded in my brain.
So I'm bringing it up like it's a normal reference. A 16-year-old film no one's thought about in a long time.
I was going to say it's like Tenet and not Tenet the bath Odeon audio cuts. You can hear the dialogue.
Tenet comes up a surprising amount on this podcast. Okay, the bad news is that since I'm living in Germany, it isn't compatible with my American cartridges. I plan on jailbreaking it though to get around the region lock.
Was this an okay price? Is the new upgrade worth it? Edit, it came with a couple of small scratches on the top screen and already jailbroken.
Condition otherwise solid. That's from Tanner.
Wait, it was already jailbroken?
Yeah, I guess so. It's funny to be selling that. The cops could trace it back to you.
But I thought he said it wouldn't play his US games.
That's a good point, actually. I'm not sure it doesn't say that.
The narrative here is very confusing.
Yeah, there's a lot of questions here.
I think if you were in a legit court, I'm not saying that this court isn't legit, but if you were in a real world court and you presented such a confusing case, if I've learnt anything from legal dramas, it's not necessarily about the facts of the case, it's just about a nice clear narrative and this really runs counter to it. There could be a lot of truth and decency in this story, but there's a lot of words which are counteracting other words. I don't really know where I'm standing.
I'm feeling quite flustered. I'm reaching for the Ultra Hand.
Yeah, I think... Okay, my one case for this, like a repeat console purchase, is simply that Nintendo has stopped manufacturing 3DS consoles. If something goes wrong with your existing one, at least you have a backup.
That's kind of what I did do with my 3DS, because my original model 3DS, I absolutely loved that original version of it. It's such a beautiful feeling, like varnish, shiny thing. The analog nub thing just kind of fell off and needed to be glued back on repeatedly, and I was like, this feels like it's going to go wrong at some point.
So I ended up buying the new 2DS XL, which is a really nice non-3D 3DS, just to have it as sort of backup, and I don't regret that decision. So that's the one thing I would say here, Matthew, and plus the prices of the 3DS really did explode during the pandemic, and I don't think they ever really came down. I think it just...
the 3DS just suddenly was no longer manufactured, and people would just buy whatever they could during the pandemic. So, yeah. But even so, if you killed them, I'd be fine with that.
Again, great lawyer here, just great lawyering, you know.
Yeah, it's got a scratch. I don't know, it just sounds quite compromised.
Yeah, you kind of did a bad sell on this. You weren't just like, God, I knew through the XXL it would cost this. You gave all this complicated backstory and created a paper trail of disasters for us to question your character, you know?
Deep down, you're probably right in your quite spirited defense of this, but I feel like this particular client needs to become a warning to history about how not to present a Games Court case. So I feel like execution is...
Well, I mean, does history... Is there history, Matthew, on Murphy Castle Island?
I mean, there's no yesterday and there's no tomorrow, so it's tricky. It's more just, you know, it'll get passed around the island as gossip, and hopefully people will think on it a bit more before coming to Games Court. Yeah, I think that's the way of thinking about it.
Listen, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to say guilty, but I'm going to attach a wheel either side, I'm going to attach a fan to his back, I'm just going to set him going, I'm going to put one of those big fat batteries on there as well, so it's going to run for a long time, and he's just going to go, he's just going to go forwards, and will he live, will he die? We don't know, he's just gone.
This is an island, so presumably at some point he will...
We just don't know, we just don't know if you go in a straight line on an island, what happens to you eventually? We just don't know, so that is my decision.
Yeah, okay, just typing in, guilty with wheels on, driving infinitely. Okay, good. Exhibit D, two guilty verdicts so far, this is dramatic.
On a trip to the UK in 2018, I came across the Wii version of Donkey Kong Country Returns, eight quid and a Glasgow CEX. I was pretty sure it would work back in Australia, since we are all pals, very good, so I took a punt and bought it. It did work and I had a great time playing through it, co-op with one of my brothers, so I believe I am safe.
I just don't really know if the price it was purchased for was really worth it since it was a different currency. Should I be executed or will I go down with a Ned Kelly quote, such is life, which everyone now knows thanks to John Wick Chapter 4. That's a bit of an overrated movie in my opinion.
That's unglacious, that one.
I mean, John Wick's not on trial.
No, you were annoyed by John Wick's coat, weren't you? Like just how many bullets he was deflecting with that thing. Didn't that get on your nerves, him doing that?
The way he holds it, I don't think is as cool as they think it is, where he kind of holds up his lapel to his face. It's got big, like the head of Tesco's has just been fired and he's leaving the building and trying to cover his face from the paparazzi energy. Corpulent, CEO, embarrassed energy.
That's good, two Tesco references on this pod. Okay, fair enough. So this is quite a boring game squat entry, this one, because eight quid seems like a fine price for a good game.
That's because it's just a good solid case.
Yeah, I hate those, you know what I mean? That's not what I specialize in. I specialize in cases where I can boot them when they're down and join in with a judge on sentencing them to...
Or that you can showboat a bit.
Yeah, exactly. So this feels like innocent to me, Matthew. Thoughts?
A great example to our last client slash victim. This is how you present it. It was this much.
The price sounds fine for what that game is. You played it. You played it with your brother.
You really got the most out of it. It sounds like you enjoyed it. It worked.
Ned Kelly quote as well. Ned Kelly quote.
There was a Ned Kelly quote. You know that I love Ned Kelly and that I fashion myself after him.
It comes up a lot.
Is he the one who wore a bucket on his head?
I don't know. I have no idea. I'm just going to Google Ned Kelly bucket.
There was a Wikipedia page called Armour of the Kelly Clan that came up when I talked to them. That would suggest so.
I've got a bucket on my head right now.
You always wear that on Sundays, don't you?
But with a mouth hole cut in it. Please, please do not try and shoot me through my mouth hole.
That is my weak point. That's where Haribo goes basically.
That's where Haribo only. No bullets.
Also, I love the idea of you suggesting to this listener that they can learn a lesson from the last listener who is no longer here because they have wheels on them and are going infinitely in one direction. Learn a lesson from that person who is no longer here and will never be here again.
We didn't learn a lesson. If anything, you should have done it in a different order. We could have told the last guy to pay attention to the Donkey Kong guy.
That's how you do it. But, you know, unless we shout really loud, I think that guy's gone now.
Yeah, sadly so. Okay, good. Well, then we have an innocent verdict.
That's good. Quick update from me. EA has patched Jedi Survivor and now Turgle looks fucking great.
Glad to hear it. My guy Turgle. I'm a big Turgle head over here.
Turgle head. Have fun again.
I think I've written down the wrong name for this person. So I wrote down Glacius again. So one of these is not Glacius.
If this was you and I got your name wrong, I apologize, but I'm not going back into the Discord.
You're lucky if this was someone who made fun of a piece of pop culture I liked, they're getting off light.
Yeah, absolutely. It could be the same person, but I don't know. I'll look it up afterwards and then mention it in the show notes or something.
Am I going to do that?
No, don't make promises that you're not going to deliver them.
Okay, Exhibit E. Could be or could not be Glacius. Let's find out.
Nintendo New 3DS XL with the wrong stylus had to go back because there wasn't one. £215 from CEX, including 88 trade-in. See, reverse Games Court.
That's a format that we're piloting, but has not taken off yet, so we have enough entry. Reverse Games Court. I'll explain more later today.
I expect Samuel to regret his words and deeds now. I don't know what that's in reference to, I'm afraid.
That's a little gear thing, right?
Yeah, but isn't that just about why Quiet's wearing a bikini or some nonsense? That's what that was. I don't know what that means.
The context is lost on me. In fairness, I can see they left it a bit late, but were still able to get the rest of the Ace Attorney games and some of the other recommendations before the eShop got pulped. Also bought the first Professor Layton for £6, Layton 2 for £6, Layton 3 for £8, and the standard Hotel Dusk £11.
Now, no prices there on the Ace Attorney games, which is frustrating.
Well, he probably bought them for digital ones.
Right, oh yeah, that makes sense, doesn't it? So, £215, that is a lot of money, but if CEX are selling it for that, that's probably what is the going price for it. And I imagine that the 3DS shop closing probably spiked this, Matthew.
So another 3DS in here, I think people just a bit buzzed up by your recommendations, trying to hoard stuff before the shop went down.
Thoughts? I don't know, is the lesson here to trust Nintendo and get in early, when it makes sense? Isn't that really what we should be saying here?
Is this a habit we want to encourage, that people buy into these things too, when they're too expensive?
Yeah, I think these are some unexpectedly high prices on some of this stuff. I don't know if anyone could have anticipated that it would cost you almost £200 to buy this ancient console now, but when you look on eBay, the cheapest going price for one of these is £150. And that for a used one.
So we are looking at these are pricey machines. I don't know, it might just be the way it is.
Yeah, but this is more expensive than £150. They didn't shop around for the best possible deal.
£215, yeah, I'm not sure why that's so expensive.
Didn't have a stylus. That paints quite a bad picture of how used it is.
Yeah, I bought my 3DS for like £130 or something. And that was when it launched and I had a great time with it. It's also weird to try and experience the magic of the 3DS so far in retrospect.
Because while it does have its own specific magic as a console, it's sort of like it's odd to play the Switch and then go back and play the 3DS, you know what I mean? Like there's a bit of a... that's a strange journey to take.
Yeah, it's very tricky. What I want to encourage is that people get on board earlier with Nintendo. I think they're safe purchases.
You don't need to be leaving them. They're not curiosities. You don't need to be leaving them until after they're out, so you pay more for a secondhand, nasty version of them.
But the actual games are fine, and wanting to have a 3DS, I can completely understand that the Lightfall Machine bought Leighton. I love Leighton. Let's say innocent, but I also want people to know that this person shouldn't necessarily be copied.
I don't want to encourage people and then to think that paying 200 plus pounds is good for a 3DS and behavior that we're going to encourage. So I'm going to ultra hand a big beam emitter, which is just a constant laser coming out of his head to the top of his head. So while he can go about his everyday life, you're just going to have to be quite careful around him.
Never get him to turn around quickly because that's going to chop down a lot of stuff. That's going to be bad news. You're going to have to crawl in front of him if you ever want to talk to him.
It's just a constant reminder that this guy wasn't completely right.
Yeah, okay, that's harsh but fair.
I would say one of those unicorn horns with the lightning coming out of it, which is another item, but I think that would probably interfere with the 3DS itself, which really negates the whole purchase. You wouldn't be able to have anything metal in your hands because you'd be constantly electrocuting yourself. So the beam is...
it could have been worse.
Yeah, I love the idea that the beam emitter doesn't punish them, but punishes every single person they will come into contact with, potentially. So there could be relative sliced and diced, etc.
Oh yeah, and it colours you in their eyes, because they're like, oh man, he's such a pain to be around, and that was because he bought this expensive 3DS, so I won't do that. I think this is the perfect result.
Okay, good, yeah, innocent, but with a beam emitter on their head. But like, cursed. Obviously, that's inherent from the idea of the punishment, to be honest.
There will be windows where, obviously, it's battery powered, and those batteries will run out, and then he'll have a moment's bliss, but once those batteries have refilled back up again, that thing's coming back on, so enjoy the five minutes of recharge time.
He's forever going, don't touch it, basically, to the beam emitter, just trying to perfectly balance it still.
And he's basically like Cyclops from the X-Men.
Yeah, yeah, you know, and how did that guy do it? He got a pair of sunglasses, like you've got to do something similar, I guess.
He got a pair of sunglasses and became like an amazing hero. Maybe I've set this guy up for a better life.
On that note, actually, have you been watching Jury Duty on Free V via Prime, Matthew?
I haven't.
It's all right. It's like, do you know what the premise is, how they tricked one guy into thinking it was a real court case and everyone else, it's all made up, but he thinks it's real the whole time, and it's kind of like a mockumentary, but James Marston is there too. That's why I bring it up.
Are you aware of this?
Wait, it's like a real guy, like a human guy.
Yeah, like he thinks it's a real court case. He thinks it's a real court case, but everyone there, from the jury to the judge to the defendant and the prosecutor, they're all actors, and it's basically like a sitcom around this guy, and you're watching him being credulous at all this random shit happening.
Wait, and it's legit. He's like an unknowing member of the public.
Yes, yes. And the interview I'm constantly throughout it.
That is quite a high stakes bit of TV making.
It is. It's like one of those shows where the premise is excellent. It's about 20% less funny moment to moment than I would want it to be, but it is good, and the highlight is James Marsden kind of playing a version of himself and just being a bit of a bastard.
No, he does, but that's like part of it as well, because it's like a Los Angeles court, and he's like, oh yeah, I'm this actor, do you know me from stuff? And then I think the guy, the normal guy, slags off one of his movies, and then James Marsden goes, yeah, I was in that. And it's quite good.
James Marsden's sort of doing the 30 Rock version of himself, basically. So yeah, it's worth checking out, I think. Bit of a TV wreck in the middle of games.
The rest of the courtroom are just looking at us having this exchange, and they're like, really, you guys want to do this here?
Yeah, two Dr. Salvatores.
Dr. Salvatores, they're getting quite antsy, man.
Okay, exhibit F. So this bit of context here, people may remember I made a joke on a previous Games Court where I was asked, like, what's your perfect Games Court entry? And I made up a pretend man called Gerard Manley, and it turned out there is a guy who's actually called Gerard Manley who listens to the podcast, but he's not technically called that.
He's got an Irish name I'm not going to try and pronounce because I'll just do a really bad job of it, but it's like G-E-A-R-O-I-D, and then Manley. So, like, you know, I don't want to have a go at that, and, you know, there's the context you need as we go into this one. So it turns out being called out by name slash manifest stood screaming into existence by Sam in a previous episode, and then buying a PC Engine Mini isn't good enough to be featured on Games Court.
I don't remember that entry, Matthew, so maybe it got lost in the inbox somewhere. Did it come across as pandering too hard? Was it Matthew's subsequently revealed anti-Irish bias?
I don't remember that coming up. All this ran through my head as I struggled through untranslated versions of Snapchat and Tokimeki Memorial. That's a bad time right there.
Anyways, here's a proper list of things the court may be interested in, most of which was purchased over lockdown. Quite a lot here, Matthew, so I'll just fire through it. Loads, actually, so it's going to be hard to make a call on this one.
PS Vita, £140 for the memory card and unwanted copy of PS All-Stars. Brutal. It's quite good for a Smash Bros.
clone that, but it is fundamentally cursed. MGHD Collection Vita version, £35. That sounds about right, price wise, to me.
My main motivation for the Vita was to play Persona 4 Golden, which I was certain wouldn't come to any consoles I own anytime soon, let alone Game Pass, but here we are. New Nintendo 3DS, £125. I have jailbroken this to, shall we say, future proof against the eShop closing, so slightly older entry here.
Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, £15. Monster Hunter 4, £9. Ghost Recon Shadow Wars, great game, £3.
Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate, average game, £6. Castlevania, Lords of Shadow, Mirrors of Fate, £18. That seems quite high, but I don't know, we like that game.
Good game, I love that game.
Tetris DS, £9. Fucking great version of Tetris, that. Bangaios Spirits, £25.
GTA Chinatown Wars, this one's confusing, it says £15.99 and then it says £40. I'm going to assume the first one's correct. Dragon Quest IX, £9.
Dragon Quest VI, £29. Now for the spicy ones, oh my god.
He's doomed. I'd say so far, I'm liking this games collection, I've not got anything against it.
You can see that there's taste behind it, right? You sense there's a sensible hand at the wheel. Okay, Dragon Quest IV, £75.
I got that one just before the lockdown for about £40. That must have really spiked that one. That's the one people like because I think you can marry someone in it, or you can choose who you marry.
Retrodots love that one. Dragon Quest V, £160. £160?
Yeah.
I've got a copy of that under my stairs. I'll give it to you.
I'll just get you a habit. Not now that you know it's worse than money. I also got a Super Famicom version of Dragon Quest VI for £9 that I can't play because I like the box art, which I know is at Games Court.
No, no. But I can play the DS version anyway. It's kind of a scary single that's written down.
Yeah, no shit. The perils of disposable income, eh? Anyways, love the pod.
And hopefully I don't get sentenced to whatever the new horrible punishment is. Cheers. Gerard Manley, perhaps.
Okay, so yeah, I think it was all going well. And then you spent £235 on two Dragon Quest games for DS. And that does seem egregious.
Thoughts, Matthew?
It's just so much money. I just don't think anything's... Well, I just think that, you know, given that you've already said there was a hint, a sniff, a whiff of piracy about this post, a jailbroken 3DS.
That's just so much money for Dragon Quest V. And I don't endorse other techniques, but that just feels kind of dumb to me.
Yeah, I think it's egregious enough that the punishment has to be severe. Just because this would suggest you've not played a Dragon Quest comprehensively before, right? They are fucking long games, notoriously so.
Having bought two quite pricey ones, that would surely be enough to tide you over for now, as you find out how much you actually like the series. So I suppose you could have played 11 and gone back to these. But to go out, all out, and just get the entire collection, it seems slightly much, despite the fact that I like almost every other one of their purchasers, Matthew.
They're all pretty good.
I'm not like anti the Dragon Quest IV for whatever it was, 70 quid?
75 quid.
I don't think I'd pay that more than that for like any game. Nothing. Oh, it's just too much.
I think there's an iOS version of Dragon Quest V, which I know is going to be a different experience, but like there are ways of playing this game. There are just other ways of playing this game. No, of course not.
So I got my Dragon Quest mixed up, by the way. Dragon Quest V is the one that is incredibly well regarded, hence that's why it's so much money, I suppose. Yeah, but they're all quite well regarded.
That doesn't make a difference.
No, I suppose not, but I think it was considered quite significant in the sort of course of RPG storytelling, like as a milestone. So I sort of, yeah, but that's just too much money, so I agree. Death's them, or whatever the pun.
What is the punishment?
I'm just looking through my selection of Zonai gadgets. I've put some charges in one of those capsule machines, so I've just got to say I'm getting a lot of cooking pots, which I can't really think of anything too good. I mean, I guess I could just cover you with cooking pots and like braise you to death.
Yeah, I mean, brutal, but you know, or just you hit them with an arrow and they turn into a perfect leg of meat, then you just cook that.
That I then cook in a cooking pot. Or like I hold them, like Link holds ingredients, so I've got this like man in my hands. Maybe some tomatoes, I chuck him in and he does that little blum, blum, blum, blum, blum.
And Link hums like a little bit of like Wind Waker or something. It just comes out as just a horrendous mess that gives you like half a heart.
Yeah, and heartburn. He needs to take a ready eye. Wow, yeah, it's just like playing Tears of the Kingdom being in this courtroom.
Wow, so immersive. Side note, by the way, you can, so yeah, Gerard, sorry, you're dead. Sorry about that.
So you could, foxes weren't in Breath of the Wild, right? They've added that to the game.
No, they were foxes.
Oh, were they? I just don't remember them. I think it's because when I played Breath of the Wild, I used to call in the Twilight Princess wolf thing and it would just go and hunt all the animals in the area.
It was quite a fun little companion.
I thought you were going to say you caught that in and then killed it for its meat.
No, it's just that when I was chasing after like a fox on horseback with a bow and arrow, I had big tory energy and that felt very unusual for Link. I could sort of see why people are trying to role play it as like vegetarian Link or whatever. I mean, it's a bit too much hard work in this game, I think.
Oh, yeah. I eat all kinds of shit in this game. I've eaten like fox, all these delightful birds, even like tiny birds are still shooting to see what happens.
Delightful birds. Okay, that's good.
You know, like flamingo looking things and like herons and a big old heron pie.
Okay, excellent. Good. All right, next one then, Matthew.
Exhibit G. Hi, I'll cut the shit. Here are my purchasers, all eBay.
The following are Dreamcast games. They're all boxed with instructions. Some have damage but nothing too egregious.
Sega Bass Fishing with fishing controller, 45 pounds. Side note, this is an absolute blast. Well-built controller, although it does sound like there are bits of broken plastic shaking around inside it during use.
It resembles a cursed maraca. Somehow, I don't think that's going to win Judge Castle over to your cause.
Are you sure it's not a Samadimigo maraca and you've just got very confused?
I was thinking the exact same thing. High five the one Dreamcast joke that you and I can make. Okay, good.
I love the idea of a guy trying to play a fishing game with just a maraca and not understanding, like, this is weird, but fuck it, whatever.
That's good. Could you use those maracas with Space Channel 5 as well? I think that's something they did.
There's another game you could use it with. Anyway, let's get distracted here. Ferrari 355 Challenge, 1099.
Trickstyle, 555. I don't know what that game is. MDK2, 799.
Ready to Rumble, Round 2, 432. Tomb Raider Chronicles, 775. Virtua Fighter 3TB, 550.
Metropolis Street Racer, 783. So bizarre creations. Precursor to Project Gotham Racing.
Choo Choo Rocket, 7 pounds. Very well regarded game. Official Dreamcast Race Controller, steering wheel boxed.
27 pounds, I mean, we don't care about that here. Side note, this is absolute gubbins. It feels offensively plastic.
I'm guessing Sega had packed it in by now, so I was excited by the fishing controller. I had to buy this. I deeply regret it.
I was so excited by the fishing controller, rather. I've also just bought the Metal Gear Solid Omnibus Deluxe Edition Graphic Novel Hardback for 91 pounds. I consider this a reasonable pricing.
It's out of print. It's in perfect condition. Thank you for your time, Your Honor.
Even I don't have that hardcover because it was too expensive. I bought the softcovers. This came up during the XXL episode on comic books that we did.
I talked about Metal Gear as something that the listeners might be quite curious about checking out the Ashley Wood artwork in the first two adaptations of the Metal Gear series. They were really good. I have clearly poisoned Nathan Brady Eastam's mind into buying that.
The rest of the purchases seem fairly inoffensive to me, Matthew. I would expect to pay a little bit over the odds for a fishing controller, but £45 doesn't seem too bad. I'm not particularly inspired by the list of games, but there are some verified Dreamcast classics in there alongside Ready to Rumble, of course.
Thoughts on this one?
Again, having to pass judgement on Dreamcast games always makes me feel ill at ease. Yeah, I mean, the prices aren't extreme or anything. The problem is, everything now, I'm recontextualising everything based on the £170 Dragon Quest V.
And this all seems very sensible. For like the price, less than the price of that one game, you have kind of like an instant little Dreamcast collection. Yeah.
And that's kind of hard to argue with.
Trickstyle, by the way, is quite a cool looking hoverboard game from Criterion. And Eurogamer called it a cult classic, apparently. It was like got like sevens at the time, but apparently it was just like a smush completely by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, as you might expect.
But yeah, it looks pretty cool.
It's the Metal Gear hardback that's given me pause.
Yeah, that's tough. Tough you threw that in there, really. It's like you were doing so well, you know?
I always find it hard to rate things which aren't games or peripherals or hardware, you know?
What's the most you've paid for an out of print Japanese crime fiction novel?
Well...
A twist.
Over a hundred pounds.
Well then, come on.
Oh, I was going to say that's a legit collection, but this might be a legit collection. If this is the only extra bit of Metal Gear paraphernalia they have, that would be mad. If it's like the Crown Jewel in a collection of many things, but that isn't in the note, is it?
Well, the thing is, it is every single bit of Metal Gear comic they did in one big hardcover, and nicely presented hardcover as well. Publishers IDW, they always do nice trade binding and stuff like that. So, it is a nice artifact for sure.
Even though, I agree that's a lot of money. I personally wouldn't have wanted to pay more than 50 quid for it, but that's just me, you know?
Okay. I mean, you kind of got me on the Japanese crime fiction thing. I could be snooty about it, but I think I'm gonna let this one go.
Okay, good. Innocent. There you go, Nathan.
You're welcome, mate. Okay, next one. That's what I say to all my clients.
Johnny Sasaki has entered the court.
Oh, no.
And I'm ultra handing his shitty barrel to hold up Addison's sign.
And he's very grateful for it and gave you some more fucking rice balls. And you're like, no.
Yeah, great. Because that's just what I want to eat after smelling a big barrel of human shit is a lot of rice balls.
Yeah, exactly. With a bucket on your head as well.
Just feed me rice balls through my hole.
Very cursed sentence for this podcast.
Can you ultra hand the rice ball up to my mouth?
No, it's too late. He's fused it to his fucking big thick stick or whatever it's called. That's a very silly name for a weapon in that game, isn't it?
Okay. Hi lads. As a big fan of Games Court and having enjoyed the thrill of getting away with Shining the Holy Ark previously, which we did deem a good Games Court entry, I wanted to submit the court my as yet uncompleted Shining collection.
I'm still missing the GBA games brackets. I'm reluctant to ever get these, given the expense and abundance of counterfeit GBA games around. And Scenario 2 and 3 of Shining Force III, which I'm sad to say, I have owned previously and sold on for a much lower price than I go currently.
Having failed to play them years ago with a printed paper translation, probably Ashley Day bought those. But I'm very happy with where it's at for now. For the record, I also own a copy of Shining Resonance Refrain for the Switch, but bought it new so I haven't included it in the list below.
This is someone who's like, I know you guys are a massive fan of the Shining series, and it's like, nope. So I'm just going to give you lots of caveats that don't mean anything to you anyway. But I appreciate the gesture.
We should add, I'm aware many of these are Japanese-only releases. I'm holding out for the day when smart glasses are affordable and the technology is usable to play these with live translations. That might be wishful thinking, yep, but I live in hope, as most of these are likely never going to receive official Western releases or fan translations.
Here we go, Matthew. It's quite a list.
Tell from your tone of voice that you're just like, this is going to be a death.
I sound a bit dumb, do I? I'm just kind of eyeing the clock, and I'm like, I'm going to have a sausage sandwich in 40 minutes. OK, Shining in the Darkness, Sega Mega Drive, PAL, £25.

Total spend £327.50. Loving the podcast, that's from Michael. Bloody hell.
You just join us there for the worst single minute of The Back Page podcast there's ever been.
I was there thinking, well, that's the listenership tuned out for this week. I should have said, look back on some Patreon before I read that out, shouldn't I? Oh well.
Okay, lots of Shining Force games there. I mean, I guess if you're passionate about one series and you buy this many, then I kind of get it on some level as someone who's gradually tried to accumulate things like Metal Gear, The Twin Snakes, or PS1 copies of Final Fantasy games I missed out on, or DS games, GBA games. I sort of get the urge to fill in gaps, and £327 for that amount of games doesn't seem too bad.
However, I will say that if you're not going to play the Japanese ones until there's some other solution to it, that seems tough to me because it seems like I'm imagining this is a big enough series that a lot of them have fan translations. So to completely give up on the idea of playing them at all seems like it seems like it goes against everything that Judge Matthew Castle stands for. Thought something?
Well, I did know that this one was coming. So I actually appointed a special council to help me with this one.
Oh, right.
I call on Ashley Day to come to this courtroom. Oh, he can't make it. He has sent me a statement to read out.
Okay, good.
Bottom line. What they need to do is sell any shining game made after 1998 because most of them are utter poop. Camelot broke up with Sega after Shining Force 3 and Sega replaced them with various work for higher studios and an art director from the hentai world.
They now trade in substandard gameplay and smutty character designs intended to sell merchandise to weebs. Once they've sold all that, they can use the money to buy legit versions of all three parts of Shining Force 3 in brackets, the best game ever made. But that's for another trial.
That's me saying that. Plus the bonus premium disc in NLB Golden, which I think was a special disc that came after with some extra battle scenarios you could transfer save data into. If they have any cash left over, buy the Mega Drive Mini 2 so you can play Shining Force CD.
Until they make this trade, I'd consider them a person of taste who has strayed from the path. He also questions whether you can count a physical reproduction of a fan-translated game as part of the official collection. He says, get the real thing and mod it.
The originals aren't that expensive.
Well, okay. Well, first of all, like, Ash should have his own games podcast because he knows so much about fucking obscure games from the 90s. So that's good.
Secondly, how many courtrooms can you, like, bring in another judge because you don't know what you're talking about? I'm not sure what I'm about with patricide, so I'm just going to bring in another judge for this one.
Well, listen, I think the central point though, that this series doesn't deserve to be seen as an entire series in the collection and that there is a Camelot era and a post-Camelot era, I think that's an interesting point. It renders half these purchases, silly purchases, in the eyes of this Shining Force expert. I didn't go to all this length to bring in this expert and not to listen to him.
He did say, this is the bit I deleted because it didn't serve my purposes, it's definitely enough to put them on probation if not dunking in the death tank, which we obviously aren't doing, we're not doing that anymore. Michael Caine cannot take any more dunkings, we've got to give him a break. I feel like the expert is suggesting Mercy, but Mercy with quite a stern message attached, maybe is that another beam emitter attached to their head?
Yeah, at least a wheel, you know what I mean?
I just want something to say, you've been in court and it didn't completely go your way.
What about the flame turret thing, what about that instead?
Or one of those bazookas? It just fires a big bomb every like five seconds.
Quite a violent game, what do you think about it? Tears of the Kingdom for a Nintendo game, isn't it?
It's quite funny actually. Simon Parkins, right up in the New York, was saying that the evolution of your vehicles in this game and the pacing of parts does end up mimicking the kind of evolution of gliders to early planes to high tech war machines.
Right, right.
It follows the arc of history quite neatly and you do end up just building attack drones, killing entire bosses without doing anything yourself. It's a very political game. Move over, Kojima.
But without any commentary. It's just played for lols basically.
It's just Fujiwashi going, makes you think. This guy gets to live, but he has firing weapon attached to his head.
Okay, so yeah, innocent but gun on head. So yeah, that's interesting, because I feel like the sheer volume of games that Ash considered bad would have drowned that out, but you know, I see the logic there. Out of interest, how was your life with your Mega Drive 2 Mini tweeting you, Matthew?
Still enjoying that thing?
Oh, I love it so much.
Do you feel like you filled in all the gaps in Sega history that you underestimated as you gave Sonic CD a go? Has that been good for you?
Yeah, let's move on from that.
Okay. Okay, this is not, yeah, this is not Matthew Castle on trial. That's illegal on Castle Island.
Exhibit I, big fan of Human Revolution. That's Deus Ex, Human Revolution.
Not just the concept.
You're a big fan of Cuba, you know. Finished it before the boss patch and everything. 23rd of August, 2016.
Okay, that's ages ago, Jesus Christ. Mankind Divided on Xbox One at launch day 39.99. I got a couple of hours in and then fell off and traded it in.
January 2018, bought it on PS4 for 4.99. And on Facebook Marketplace, November 2018, I bought the £150 limited edition from Game for £19.99, featuring an Adam Jensen statue. December 2022, I bought it on Steam for £8 as part of the Full Deus Ex collection.
It's been on PS Plus and Game Pass. I've still not finished it. Rich Spurs 24.
Feels like death for me. Because, I mean, again, this is not my court, but just because this is a great game, Mankind Divided, and you should just play it instead of keep buying it. That's my thought on this, Matthew.
Thoughts?
Yeah, you should have just played it when you originally bought it and then not traded it in. Also, I'm not a big statues guy. I don't know if I want a big statue of Adam Jensen in my house.
Yeah, it's a hard one to explain if like, well, no, I suppose you are married, so you can sort of get away without all kinds of bullshit.
Well, I can just say it's Catherine's.
Well, yeah, exactly.
Anything weird, I just say, oh yeah, that's Catherine's.
That's good. So all those statues of Squire from Final Fantasy VIII, that's secretly yours, Matthew, of course.
No, that's hers. I have one toy on our shelves, and it's a model of Rock Lee from Naruto.
That's good. A little homage to your past there, to you in the late noughties, yeah.
It's like one of my Horcruxes, that thing.
Can we still make that reference without it being like incredibly cursed?
Yeah, I think so.
Okay. Yep, so you go with guilty this one?
You're so keen. Yeah, it's just a preposterous narrative that you've painted here. I mean, any one of these individual purchases, bar the statue, would have been fine, all of them together.
Yeah, it's just wild to me. So I'm going to augment your body with 200 planks, and I'm just going to chuck you off a mountain, see what happens.
His last words were, I never asked for this. Okay, guilty. Sorry about that, Rich Spurs, but thanks for listening to the podcast.
Okay, exhibit J. July 2021, so a little late to blame on lockdown madness, I purchased The Sims 2 on DS for £7 from eBay. Clearly as part of a very bored scrolling session, I have succumbed to the clickbait of a Facebook ad directing me to an Itaku article titled, Folks Think The Sims 2 on Nintendo DS is Haunted by swiping posts from a Reddit thread of reminiscence by millennials who grew up with the game as kids.
The article tries to put together a narrative that it was some kind of unique fever dream of a game which had to be tried to be believed, and I fell for it. Without nostalgia goggles, it was of course not a lynchian surreal journey into the mind, but just data jank that I played for no more than a few hours. On the plus side though, my kids tried it, were likewise unimpressed, and have since stopped pestering me to get them The Sims 4.
I'm just not ready for the big woohoo talk yet, so maybe it's all worth it. That's from Jam Warrior, and then they link to the article.
Strong email. Good little joke at the end. I like that.
Great content.
Kind of an unforgivable purchase. You fell for the oldest one in the book, which is a younger writer tries to take their shitty game from childhood and make it sound like it's more important than it actually was. Come on, no one falls for it.
It's a huge no from me, dog.
Quite cheap.
Time bomb. Straight attached to the head. I throw an acorn at the time bomb to activate it.
You should probably leave the courtroom first. And then I'll throw the acorn. Job's done.
OK, I think £7 is fine to check out the deal with this, but I do also think that it's kind of like, if you weren't there, you can't expect to have the same experience. And also, why would you just watch it on YouTube instead of buying it?
There's so many of these things though, where people are so desperate to mine every gaming experience they have. There isn't content in every gaming experience you have.
Mate, have you heard this fucking podcast?
Yeah, and we're talking about good games. Hundreds of games I have played that never get mentioned, because there's just nothing in them. Not everything you played was an important stepping stone in the history of games.
It just wasn't. I think I've probably mentioned every game I've played on this podcast.
No!
I feel like I'm probably getting there at this point. Yeah, we're at least closing in on it.
I don't know, I'm thinking about all the shit I had to review for reviews, roundups in in-game or whatever. That's what this is. It's a 40% 100 word review.
Those games, they just do not have anything of worth. And just because there's a fucking hour long YouTube video essay about how this is some fucking creepy pasta cursed bullshit doesn't make it so.
What a great rant. I really enjoyed that.
There's loads of this. There are people like, oh, actually the GBA movie tie in for fucking Alex Ryder's got this really great meme content in. It fucking hasn't.
Don't try and trick people into spending money on horse shit like that.
It is interesting. It feels a bit like, because I see things that I consider quite standard from my days of playing games, re-appropriated and mythologized on YouTube quite a lot. And that's quite an interesting thing.
The only thing I can really compare it to is what happens to the iconography from the Batman universe and Batman Beyond when it's like a future society, but all of these weird villains and stuff from the past are revered and re-appropriated and cycle in and out of the culture. It feels like that where I'm like, this is my own personal history, but I'm looking at it through this lens of a younger generation's claiming it as something it's not. You know what I mean?
That's quite interesting to see.
Yeah, but that's because I'm old, you know? I don't have that imagination. I just see too much freelancer grift in it, you know?
I've managed to sell someone on the idea that this not very good Harvest Moon Game Boy game is actually a seminal work. And it's like, come on.
Yeah, but then the flip side of it is like Jeremy Peel writing about Trespasser, you know what I mean, after doing the podcast on it for us.
Yeah, but that's a big, mad, famously weird, interesting game. There are those games, but...
Well, I'm just saying it's okay to mine that stuff if you think it genuinely is significant. Anyway, that's not really worth it.
Yeah, I don't want to get too grumpy about it.
No, that's why it's coarse. Let's move on to exhibit K. Guilty Acorn Explosion.
Well, that's ironic, given what just happened.
Oh, yeah, very good.
Oh, sorry. When you said we're going on to the next one, I thought it was from someone called Guilty Acorn Explosion.
I did wonder what you were talking about there.
And the next one is called Wheelhead. That's weird, isn't it?
I genuinely thought that's what just happened. I was like, no fucking way. That's incredible.
This has the makings of a great games court so far, I think. The guys are called Jamie, I'm afraid, Matthew. Sorry to burst your bubble there.
Bought a DS Lite from CEX for £40. Was supposed to be a present for my girlfriend because she wanted to try some old DS games. However, she hasn't used it at all.
I also wanted to transfer Pokemon from Leaf Green to Platinum, which needs the Lite's GBA slot. That seems okay to me price-wise. Side note, I had two different girlfriends who I gave DSs to.
And they didn't play in both cases.
Is that from you or the letter writer? One was a DS Lite, one was a 3DS. But I was like, the 3DS was because she'd heard Link's Awakening was quite cool and weird, and wanted to try it.
That's quite a good example of a game, Matthew, that is strange, but maybe its reputation is slightly outsized versus the reality of actually playing it in a similar way to what we were just discussing. But obviously, unlike The Sims on DS, it's actually a good game. So, yeah, what do you think, Matthew?
DS Lite for £40? I feel like a DS by itself is a bit weird in the world of the 3DS. The 3DS is so expensive, but maybe this makes sense.
The GBA thought this fair enough, you know?
I still like the form factor of the original DS Lite. It's a nice thing. No, I couldn't judge anyone for that.
£40 for such a delightful thing. You can buy loads of great games for this. Yes, you could play them on 3DS, but they were like...
There's something to be said for playing it on the OG hardware. This is where they belong. Well, not the OG hardware, but the Lite version.
Yeah. So, innocent then?
Yeah, so innocent.
Not even a little wheel strapped to the head, like a plank?
No, nothing. Just solid. It's just a solid thing.
I can't be too down on that. Sorry, I'm still slightly distracted by thinking they were called Acorn Explosion Head.
That was confusing. Exhibit L. Hi, gentlemen.
The eBay purchases below all began in 2021. I've just got to warn the listeners. This is going to be another bad minute of The Back Page reading this out.
I'm dreading it, personally. And have continued to this present date. I really like Monster Hunter Games' association of playing these while holding infant son, etc.
A bit of dad content in there as a little chaser. I apologise for the confusing game titles. It's a franchise quirk.
Pack of three PSP games. Monster Hunter 2nd, Monster Hunter 2ndG and Monster Hunter 3rd, 1699. These are dollar prices, by the way.
These are Japanese imports, which I cannot play on PSP. Uh-oh. It, however, inspired me to jailbreak my PS Vita to download those same games and patch them to partial English.
This, in turn, inspired me to hack my 3DS. I don't mind admitting these things. Sony has never cared about the Vita.
Nintendo is famously very chill about this sort of thing. Tukidin Kiwami for the PS Vita, $28. A game with a Monster Hunter type game loop.
Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate for the 3DS, $20. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate for the 3DS, $15. Monster Hunter Freedom Unite for the PSP, $15.
I don't have this much fucking time to play these, Jesus. Monster Hunter Freedom Unite again, $10.49. The first copy arrived without the right case, but with the wrong PSP game.
Oh, the game that came with it was Jean D'Arc, an interesting strategy RPG from Level 5. I think that's actually a pretty strong purchase by itself, even if you did get it by accident. Monster Hunter World for PS4, $0.99 plus $6 shipping.
It's a good price for a very good game. I have this game on PC already. Uh-oh, I don't own a PS4.
Uh-oh. Monster Hunter Frontier Online for Xbox 360, $14. Another import from Japan.
They unplugged the servers for this game a few years back, but it's since been revived for PC by fans in a manna legally grey. This game is a blast, so I thought a physical copy would be nice. I don't own an Xbox 360.
Uh-oh. Fucking hell.
I'm sure Capcom don't care that the servers have come back on. Running total $126.47 over a period of one and a half years. Happy hunting.
I'll find who that was to give you all the verdict on this one, Matthew. Because I personally think that's just... No one's got time to play all that, and a lot of it just seemed to be, like, you know, for display purposes, which we don't encourage in this podcast.
I just feel as well, like, maybe someone will be howling with indignation at this, but the Monster Hunter games, they're not thought of in terms of, like, oh, I still prefer that old entry over this new entry. Generally, the arc of Monster Hunter is that they're, like, improving them. Yes, there are spin-offs that maybe behave differently, but, like, the people I know who are really into Monster Hunter, they move on to the next Monster Hunter.
The community moves with the game, and then they play hundreds, thousands of hours of that game and its expansions and whatnot, and then they move on to the next. This isn't a, oh, man, I, you know, I want to play Dragon Quest V again, you know? It's not that kind of game.
It doesn't have that kind of community. I think a lot of the appeal of those early games was playing with other people, especially those early games. Like, they've made them more single-player friendly as they've gone on.
It was designed for local social play on frickin Japanese tube trains. It's not putting aside that I don't play, I can't play these things, I don't have these machines. I just don't think this is a series that behaves like that.
Maybe that's wrong. Maybe there is an underground frickin Monster Hunter 2G community. But it doesn't reflect what I know about Monster Hunter, so I think that's mad.
Yeah, the other thing is as well, like, surely part of the pleasure of them evolving is that those PSP Monster Hunters, if you ask me, are not nice-looking games. Whereas Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter, what was the one that just came out on Monster Derise? Those are unquestionably nice-looking games in their own terms.
So it feels weird to me to be like, to go back to something that looks that old hat, where you can just enjoy the, you know, like you say, the community moves with it, but also the games just move on. Capcom games just get prettier and prettier. So, yeah, I think I'm with you on that.
It's MK, by the way.
So do you want to see a less sophisticated version of your favorite monsters of today? Probably not.
Yeah, it's a bit different to something like Pokemon, for example, where there's a genuine reason people go back beyond nostalgia purposes.
I'm willing to be told that actually that is a big thing and that every monster hunter still has its champions. It's not something I've ever heard about or encountered. Yeah.
I wonder what Joe Scribs thinks of this one as a big monster hunter head, but I don't know. We can't keep bringing in guest judges to this kind of thing.
No, we can't have any more special councils.
Okay, so what's the verdict?
Well, it's got to be guilty. But as you like monsters so much, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to attach your feet to a plank so you can't move, and I'm going to push that plank in front of one of those three-headed dragons that are now flying around Tears of the Kingdom. I've not actually fought one yet because they look scary, but I'm guessing it's just going to incinerate you, and you'll probably enjoy it because you're obviously into monsters.
Okay, very good. All right, we're nearly at the end, actually. So this is exhibit M, this is the second to last one.
I think it's actually more guilty than innocent so far. This is the bloodiest games court yet, although there's not much blood, this is a lot of vehicle parts and weapons being attached to people.
I've been updated that the guy with the wheel and the engine did make it to the sea and is no longer with us.
Good update there, thanks. Who handed you that? Was that one of the Dr. Salvador's?
Or did Wario enter the courtroom?
A quiet word in my bucket.
Okay, I want to put that last person to death just from making me read out all those Monster Hunter game names. That felt like some kind of sick torment for sexual pleasure. I was not into that at all.
Exhibit M, greeting Samuel and Matthew. Thanks very much for the podcast. I've thoroughly enjoyed making my way through your back catalogue over the last few months.
I thought I would send in some of my purchasers from a recent trip to CX Bristol on 22nd of April. Good CX stat, fucking massive. To the Games Court for your upcoming episode.
Did you used to go to that CX, Matthew, for your Xbox job?
Yeah, I used to have to go there of like, shit, we need these games for a list feature and basically what list feature we did would be based on like, what I could find in that CX. So that's how much of a good forward planner I was.
Good stuff, yeah, nothing has changed. I present to the court the following. Ninja Gaiden 2 for Xbox 360, £2.50.
Max Payne 3 for Xbox 360, £3.50. Final Fantasy 13 for Xbox 360, £2.00. WarioWare Smooth Moves for Wii, £4.00.
While I'm fully aware that Judge Castle has bemoaned his time with WarioWare while stuck in the Wii house, I believe the other three games more than make up for it. All 360 games there are backwards compatible, with two of them being Xbox One X Enhanced and the other, Max Payne 3, previously being submitted to the court by Judge Castle himself. Ninja Gaiden 2 on 360 is also considered to be the best version of that game.
Keep up the great work and I hope I'm not crushed by a thwomp. Regards, Tom Woodward. That doesn't strike me as a good collection, Matthew.
He's only really, he's just about broken the £10 mark there, but...
Yeah.
Ninja Gaiden 2, Max Payne. I don't know about Max Payne on console, because I've played the PC version now and know it to be superior from the mouse and keyboard controls. But for completionist's sake, it still looks nice on 360.
Thoughts?
That's definitely the one I'm least into, specifically on 360. But the other ones, as he says, Xbox enhanced, that's a really nice feature. I think Final Fantasy 13 goes from being a bit of a laughing stock on Xbox to something quite nice.
Courtesy of that upgrade, something quite enviable and desirable. So, you know, can't really argue with that. I think £4 for Smooth Moves is great.
My beef with Smooth Moves was more like, it felt especially throwaway, as do most WarioWare games, for like £40. That's like the perfect series to buy pre-owned. All of those games are worth playing once they're like sub £10.
Definitely, yeah. So that seems okay to me. I feel like any Nintendo-made Wii game that's like £5 or less seems all right to me.
Yeah, you'd get like £4 worth. I mean, that's cheaper than a prep baguette, and that only lasts, what, 10 minutes max?
Oh, 10 seconds, I was going to say. Okay, so we've got an innocent verdict there. I agree, though, those are some good purchases, and you're getting the most out of your Xbox Series X there, or whatever you're using there.
So, yeah, responsible choices, if anything. There was a disappointing lack of drama, but it was nice just not to be reading out Monster Hunter game names, so I'm happy. Or, indeed, fucking Shining Force names.
Okay, last one here. Some really good ones here, Matthew. This is from email.
This is from Stefan at SlowestBro on Discord or Twitter. I don't know, he's from Boston. Love the podcast.
After listening for a long time, I think it's finally time to throw my hat in the ring with one year's worth of purchases. May the shining light of JC's kitchen cleanse me. Well, it's in fucking Trowbridge now.
When you said shining there, that gave me the fear.
Yeah, shining light, hentai, EXA on PS2, $18. All games are complete in box, bought on eBay in the US between April 1st, 2020 and February 14th, 2021. Very forensic.
Rogue Galaxy on PS2, $19.99. White Knight Chronicles 2 on PS3, $11.99. Persona Q, Shadow of the Labyrinth, 3DS, $34.99.
There's a note there saying, Etrian Odyssey equals great, Persona equals great, the combination a terrifically mediocre game. Oh, interesting. Where do you all stand on Etrian Odyssey?
We can come back to that. Devil Summoner, Soul Hackers, 3DS, $161. Incredibly bad timing buying it then.
It's now $90 new. It must have had some new copies of it or something. Devil May Cry, PS2, $6.95.
Blood Omen, Legacy of Cain, PS1, $37.90. I apparently bought this on Valentine's Day. Those are the games, Matthew.
Funny thing, just a side note here. There was a time in 2006 where Rogue Galaxy was my most anticipated game of any game.
Based on what?
Based on the fact that it looked incredible. It's a late in the day PS2 game from Level 5, who had made Dark Cloud and Dark Chronicle, or Dark Cloud 2 if you're in the US.
Dragon Quest 8 as well?
Yep, Dragon Quest 8. It seemed like they were going to be the JRPG, the kings of the JRPG going forward. The genre itself had been...
There are some really good JRPGs at the end of the PS2 era, but they seemed to emerge with Dragon Quest 8 as they can make really pretty Japanese RPGs that also feel a little bit contemporary. This seemed really exciting because it's their version of Star Wars, basically like cell-shaded Star Wars except with pirate ships going through space with engines fit to them and stuff, so it had a really nice aesthetic. Then I played it and it was so fucking hard, so hard that I really just burned out on it and didn't get that far with it, even though it seemed pretty decent and now I think you can actually play on PS4.
I just wanted to relay that. There was a time where I looked at screenshots of that thinking, there's no way this can't be the greatest game ever made. And it sort of came along and I feel like it's a bit of a cult favourite, but you don't hear people talking about it all that much, really.
White Knight Chronicles, I think both of those are considered a little bit disappointing on PS3, because there was a long-awaited Level 5 game they got here, and I think they kind of got like 6s and 7s. I'm not so sure about the second one, but I remember the first one, people were like, this is going to be a big PS3 exclusive, and it was kind of a bust. Can't speak for the other ones too much, though I will say that I have no idea if Devil May Cry on PS2 is £6.95 or not.
It doesn't seem that much, but that's obviously a classic, so Legacy of Cain is a weird one though. I'm not sure, I don't have the love for that series and I would have just bought that on GOG or something instead of spending $38 on it. So it maybe seems like too much money has been spent here, Matthew.
Thoughts? It's kind of an interesting era for Level 5. Obviously I know them through their Nintendo games where they were doing like mega business with Layton and then they seemed to have the magic touch for like launching franchises like Inazuma 11 and it seemed that they were making serious bank on DS while putting out a series of PS3 things that didn't quite land.
Yeah, I guess Ni No Kuni is like much more of a success for them. It has a much clearer thing. I think White Knight Chronicles wasn't that the one which had like an online component.
There was a little bit of a kind of frenzy to try and...
Monster Hunter kind of experiences.
Yeah, sort of Monster Hunter experience or there's that kind of chip on the shoulder about, you know, Japanese game developers don't do as much sort of with online as like Western game developers. So they start just trying to cram it into genres where it doesn't necessarily make sense like a JRPG. I think the co-op in this is literally like, I think it's just like you get together for like fetch missions together.
And actually what is of interest is just the core, the core sort of single player game.
It's tough because, well, like the White Knight Chronicles 2, Sony declined to publish it in North America and D3 published it instead, which would suggest that the first one had never quite had the impact. But yeah, but that was also true of Demon's Souls. So who knows?
Quality aside, it feels like an interesting kind of corner of gaming to have in your collection. And I've not played Rogue Galaxy, but I remember having sort of similar vibes about it and definitely coming off the back of like Dragon Quest 8 and, you know, they made incredibly pretty games and very solidly made JRPGs. It always gave me slight Skies of Arcadia vibes from afar.
Yeah, definitely, which is kind of a cool thing to tap into. There's nothing here I'm like, holy shit, I love it. But there's also nothing here I'm like, this gives me pause.
I kind of get it in the case of like the Shin Megami Tensei 3DS games. You want to try and hoard those before the 3DS store closes and they are not widely available in other systems, even though it seems like Sega and Atlus are pretty committed to getting those games and other platforms now, which is great. So I kind of get that one.
The Legacy of Kane, though, you really can just go on GOG and buy this on a basic PC. I don't get the urge to buy on PS1 personally.
What was the really expensive Devil Summoner he bought?
Soul Hackers.
Generally Shin Megami Tensei and its spin-offs are all quite highly regarded, you know? There's not one where it's like, avoid this one, it's a mega howler, which I know isn't a very deep take. You know, I don't know the individual series strands particularly well, but I know you can't really go wrong.
I bought loads of these when E3DS eShop was closing. Yeah. They were all like five quid each and I just bought like five of them.
The one I couldn't bring myself to buy was Devil Survivor. The second one was quite cheap, but the first one, they never reduced the price and it was always like 40 quid. I just couldn't quite bring myself to take a punt on it in the end.
Yeah. Now it's gone forever, of course, so that's tough.
One of my big regrets actually, Weki Mame and Gamer was we would always have access to these games and we'd always just farm them out to like Tom Sykes as a freelancer. Reviewed most of our Shin Megami Tensei stuff and he wasn't like super into it, particularly himself. It was just a sort of matter of necessity.
But in time, it's like a series, not a series I dismissed, but I just didn't have like a huge amount of interest in. But the ones I have played, I've really liked and I kind of wish I had gotten in on that earlier and built up the knowledge when it was a bit more manageable. Now there's like fucking 15 of these things that the internet suggests you really should play if you want to get into this and you're like, well, I'm never going to do that.
Well, the thing is, right, like the first one I played was Nocturne back in 2006. I bought that and I did buy it because Dante from Devil May Cry was in it because that seemed cool to me and I played it and it was so dark and strange because it was published by Ghostlight, a pretty small UK publisher who were like specialized in still specialized in bringing Japanese games over. It had no real footprint and it seemed to me like it was too dark and strange to ever catch on in a mainstream way.
That's how I felt about it. I thought compared to something that's easy to package up like Final Fantasy, these monsters are quite weird. This world is quite dark and it seems a little bit, it's very atheist games as well.
It seemed to me like they were never going to catch on. Then Persona 3 and 4 happened and then by the time Persona 5 comes along, pretty much anything that Shin Megami Tensei related now is quite a big deal. I never saw that coming personally because it always seemed like it wasn't going to catch on but I didn't see the online age coming where people would fetishize that dark, weird stuff, you know, so yeah, interesting.
Yes, where does that leave us on this? I just don't feel passionately enough to kill this guy with some mad contraption. I'm kind of with you.
Fundamentally, I think the things are sound. Persona Q is actually, and he said this himself, not the best hang. On paper, it should be rad.
The persona kind of aesthetic of it, the Etrian Odyssey kind of labyrinth mapping is really satisfying in the core loop of that game is you're exploring a massive maze that you are kind of drawing out on the touchscreen and like mapping in by kind of doing these deeper expeditions. And there's this real sense of you get in a certain distance and then you're like, no, I'm, you know, I'm going to lose. So I'm going to die.
You know, I'm too weak. So I have to kind of leave the maze and then go back in. It's very systems driven.
It's quite a pure RPG in that sense, but definitely a series I recommend people experience once, maybe not the persona Q version. But I think they're re-releasing or remaking, or the Etrian Odysseys at the moment. So people have a chance to rediscover them.
So fundamentally nothing too egregious. I mean, quite expensive for Shimugami Tensei, but probably the coolest game in that lot. So why not?
Yeah. So it's kind of like the logic we applied to Dragon Quest. Doesn't quite apply here, I suppose.
But yeah.
I mean, it's the difference between like 170, you know, and this.
Yeah. 161 for Soul Hackers is quite a lot of money.
Oh shit. It's 161, was it? Yeah, yeah.
Oh, right.
But for Persona Cube, it was 34.99.
Oh, that does feel like a double standard.
Yeah. And then Legacy of Cain's 37.90. So it's quite a lot.
When has logic ever controlled this court?
I kind of agree with you in the sense that like, if it's about what it's worth and you're paying under 40 quid, generally speaking, it's okay to buy something that you genuinely want to own or you have some kind of affection for, you know what I mean? Like 40 pounds feels like the upper limit of like what is considered acceptable. And I say that as someone who spent, I think, like 80 quid on the Twin Snakes for GameCube.
So yeah, okay, all right. So you're still undecided?
No, I'm gonna let him go.
All right, okay, bit of a double standard there, but that's, it's Castle Island. There is no logic at work here. Logic's not banned, time is banned, but still, logic is frowned upon sometimes.
Okay, gonna count up these guilty verdicts, Matthew, because I think I've lost, so let's see. Oh no, there's only five guilty verdicts and the rest are innocent. Although some of them have turrets strapped to their heads.
So, yes.
Did they really win?
I think the winner, as ever, is the listenership. Actually, they're also the losers though, so it's tough. But yeah, I've won this one again, another successful court case for better call Sammy.
I guess that kind of works, doesn't it? So, let's go with that. Yeah, I think I enjoyed this.
I think this is one of our stronger games courts, Matthew. I don't feel like it flagged too much. We didn't have too much waffle from the listeners on their life story.
It was balanced out all right. Give or take a Monster Hunter or Shining entry.
Yeah, some interesting picks. I feel like some good executions. Still feel bad about the guy, just let to wheel off into his death, but you know, so it goes.
Yeah, he really will be a warning to other people though. Like that's a great story, a great deterrent. And that's what you need when you have a budget dictatorship such as Matthew Castle Island.
