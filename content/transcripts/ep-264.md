Hello and welcome to the back page of Video Games Podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Matthew, we're joined by a returning special guest. This week we have Kezim McDonald on the podcast who last appeared on the back page five years ago. Talking about whether E3 uh still mattered in 2021. Spoiler alert, it did not. Kes' book, Super Nintendo, How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun. is out on February twelfth from Faber and Faber in the UK. I think it has a slightly different title in the US, Keza, but it's great to have you back on. How are you doing?

Keza
00:53
I'm good, thank you guys. I know it's been a while. It's nice to talk to you from uh not from COVID madness.

Samuel
00:58
Yeah. Yeah, it's wonderful to have you on and in a perfect subject. I'll confess that I've just read the Animal Crossing section of the Bookcare's. I haven't quite finished it, but I'm getting there. It is really, really good. And I'm excited to ask you a bit about it.

Matthew
01:11
I've read the whole thing out of respect for you, Keza. I'm sorry, I've tried my best.

Samuel
01:16
This is what we like to hear.

Keza
01:17
I already have a favorite.

Samuel
01:19
Well, fair enough. Okay, so what what led to you uh writing the book, Kaza? What was sort of the impetus for the the project?

Keza
01:25
So I started thinking about this book a long time ago, in in twenty sixteen approximately. And it was because I'd been doing this job of the games journalism for ten years at that point. And I was thinking a lot about firstly why I got into games in the first place, and then why I still like them, and then also why I was still kind of interested in in writing about them and pursuing this ridiculous career. career after so long and the answer to all three of those things, at least in part, was Nintendo. And so I decided that if I was gonna write a book about anything, Nintendo was probably the thing I was most likely to follow through on. And also the thing that I kind of felt I had a unique perspective on. Like as we all know Nintendo is a very secretive company and I don't think that many people have had over the years as much like of an opportunity to actually talk to people at Nintendo as I have now. So I thought about it then and then I had a minor delay of ten years caused by having two children and a pandemic to deal with. And now it's finally out. So I started working on it in earnest in twenty twenty three. That was when I kind of put pen to paper as it were. And I feel like it's one of the most universal topics in video games, Nintendo. Like pretty much everybody who has played any video game has some experience with Nintendo or has some interest in Nintendo. So I thought it would be a really good way of also talking about games in general, right? Like why we play them, why they're important, why They've become, in my opinion, the defining cultural medium of our times. I felt like Nintendo was a great way into all of that as well.

Samuel
02:57
So you structure the book series by series. You manage to put the series in order where you do tell the history of the company chronologically in some ways, but you sort of tell these parallel histories of different series like uh Mario, Kirby, Pokemon, Zelda, etc. And it's really elegantly put together in that respect. What what made you decide to structure it that way as opposed to tackling the entire chronology of the company sort of step by step.

Keza
03:23
Thanks, man. I tried to put it together in a way I thought would be interesting to read, first and foremost, right? Like I really, really didn't want to write a boring history book. Uh I also didn't want it to be a chronological list of events and games consoles, do you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. I think we've all read a book about something that has that has felt really hemmed in by chronology and I wanted each chapter to not just talk about like the game in question, but also what that game says about Nintendo in general and video games in general, so Metroid was a good excuse for me to talk about gender representation in games, and then Mario was a good excuse to talk about Nintendo's sort of centering of fun, Labo, which is an unlikely subject to the whole chapter, that was a chance to talk about Nintendo's hardware design and their kind of experimental attitudes to to creating hardware. And then you know, Mario also was a really good excuse to focus in on Shigeru Miyamoto. Kirby was a good excuse to focus in on Satorywata. So every chapter is not just about the game series, although it is about the game series, it's also a way of talking about a kind of wider topic that I found particularly interesting and uh it let me get really, really nerdy about my my favourite game series, which was always fun. They had to cut so many words from the Zelda chapter, you guys. It's still the longest chapter in the book, but a lot a lot of it's missing.

Samuel
04:38
I thought it was an that was an excellent chapter. I also love the fact that with Pokemon you sort of hooked it around the idea of it being this fad at the time but then it becoming this multi-generational phenomenon that's actually much larger now than it ever has been and that was a a cool perspective to, you know, read about that series and Animal Crossing as a series that the the culture had to kind of like catch up with basically and then it found its moment at the during COVID. I mean I thought all that stuff was just incredibly well well reasoned and um as I was reading it I was like, Oh yeah, it makes total sense to me that you would structure it this way.

Matthew
05:13
What I like about it because you have you know, you're focusing on the series and each chapter kind of has the cr the chronology of that series, it means that you get to some like quite modern stuff. relatively quickly. Like sometimes I found with some history books on any subject matter, y y y you have to kind of sort of eat your vegetables in the early chapters a little bit. as you get given the sort of maybe like you know the drier kind of pre-times and it's still very interesting but you're kind of constantly hit with a mix of the old and the new which which I really liked.

Keza
05:44
That was important for me 'cause I have a um I just I have a I have a constant need for novelty. So writ writing too much about like having being constrained by chronology I would have found it boring to write, honestly.

Matthew
05:56
Yeah

Keza
05:56
And so being able to kinda dart around a bit and kinda f I find themes more interesting, right? So I was darting around finding finding themes rather than finding structuring it by year or by decade would have been would have been boring to write, and I think probably more boring to read.

Samuel
06:09
So I do think that the approach you take of making the book accessible for people who don't know anything about Nintendo, but also not making it too elementary for, you know, seasoned fans is is really smart. I was wondering, I guess like how how you decided that was the right approach. and also what were the sort of pains in making it work for both types of readers. Like I guess this is probably something you do on the guard you think about on the Guardian all the time.

Keza
06:33
Yeah, like I think honestly this is my this is my particular niche now is is talking about video games from an informed perspective. but in a way that doesn't make people you know, doesn't make normal people completely lose interest. And like balancing that is quite hard. It's it's a particular skill, because obviously I spent um what, twelve years in games media where you can assume a huge amount of knowledge, right? Reader. You know, and the kind of conversation between the the reader and the journalist is it's it's on a kind of level of like you probably know as much as me about this, or at least nearly as much as me. And if you then make that a conversation between you who knows loads and a reader who potentially knows much less, it's really hard to do that in a way that isn't either patronizing to someone who doesn't know as much or boring for someone who does know as much. So um that's I that's honestly just a skill I've I've kind of had to, by necessity I've had to hone in the l in the kind of last eight years or so. But the hardest thing about it I think is trying to explain what's interesting about a game without resorting to really unhelpful words like Metroidvania being a classic example.

Matthew
07:35
Right, right.

Keza
07:35
It's hard to do, man, like trying to trying to sort of rid yourself of gamer jargon. Or at least like mostly re rid yourself of gamer jargon. It's is pretty difficult to do but I find it's a really good prompt to to help me write more interestingly, instead of saying, you know, the combat's fluid, which doesn't really mean anything to most people. Yeah. Kind of that that thing of saying Saying in combat you throw punches and kicks with a exciting fluidity. Things like that. You know, it's it's it's it's able it's saying something that we know is shorthand, but it actually makes you um think about it a little bit more. So but then I I do think that most people have Have a passing familiarity with Nintendo, even if they don't play games at all. And I also have a really strong feeling about you know when people write about games for a mainstream audience and they spend the first kinda, you know, chapter or several paragraphs just explaining what a game is? When we read a f an article about football in the sports pages, it's not like here are the rules of football for those who aren't aware you know. It doesn't matter.

Matthew
08:31
I could do with that to be honest.

Keza
08:34
So could I in most sports journalism, but the fact is that you know other other journalists don't have to do that. They don't have to go, here is why Cricket isn't ridiculous. Here's why I like cricket. Now, here's what I was gonna say. Right. They they just kinda get right into it and so I I I feel very strongly about that, like, and The Guardian particularly, but then also in the book. Like I don't wanna you know, I don't I don't wanna have to waste time sort of justifying myself, I just want to get straight into you know why I'm writing this and also I feel like now finally finally people treat games with enough respect in general in the culture that you don't have to spend ages justifying yourself before you start talking about the interesting things.

Matthew
09:08
W one of the things I really liked about it actually, like when you get super specific at times in the book, which is maybe like the riskiest bit 'cause it requires the most specialist knowledge to understand, it tends to be like very happy memories or very you know, very specific things that you loved about particular games. And so like when you zoom right in, you know, right down into like the sort of the granular individual games, like, oh here's an anecdote from Animal Crossing, you ne you never really lose anyone because you know it it's it's kind of like the the place of purist enthusiasm in the book as well. So yeah that kind of sliding scale I you know of like here's the bigger picture like right down to here's why I like this freak who is my Animal Crossing neighbour or whatever. It's um yeah I re I like that. I can see a lot of people and it capturing people's imaginations a bit. You know, if they haven't played those games, 'cause you're like, well, I kinda wanna see that. What is that thing? You know?

Keza
10:07
To ground things and uh I'm used to writing in a slightly more detached manner just from years and years as a journalist. Um but one of the first bits of feedback I got while I was writing this from my editors was like put more of you in it. Like put more of your personal experiences in it and I was like what? No Oh, how uncomfortable. Disgusting. No. Um and then I so I had to kind of work myself up to putting a lot more of just my own thoughts, experiences and feelings into it and it was it was I think it actually was a really good call. Like I think it grounds the book in my life, which hopefully is is you know, it helps humanize things a bit, you know?

Samuel
10:39
I think that your your extremely specific anecdotes about sending memory cards in the posts for Animal Crossing and contrasted with what happens to that series when the pandemic happens is sort of like a perfect way of, you know, sort of explaining the arc of that series. So I think you found the right way to integrate that in all cases. Even if the experience of importing a Canadian GameCube is not necessarily um universal.

Keza
11:06
I used to do when I was a teenager to get a hold of important Nintendo games. I mean I I I truly think there are very few people who went to the lengths that um me me and my forum buddies in the in the 2000s went to to play these games. I remember playing Doshin the Giant in Japanese. Like who does that? Yeah. Oh yeah. I've still got one of those. Yeah, the little disc you'd put in and it would it would, you know used to get them from PlayStation 2 as well, I think, but it would make every disc playable on your pal machine and it's like, yeah, you don't have to do this anymore. People just download shit now. It's so much easier. Uh they don't know they're born.

Matthew
11:46
The best free gift I ever got from a games magazine was Cube magazine. gave away. I think maybe a sample of freeloader, just to let you play Animal Crossing. So it's like if you import Animal Crossing, this disc will let you play US Animal Crossing on your UK GameCube.

Keza
12:02
That's so specific.

Matthew
12:03
Yeah, well well but i the the I I think that's a great gift. Like, here's a ticket to the thing that we've been talking loads about that you'd like to have play but you can't probably. And I did do it and I you know I got a US copy of Animal Crossing and Yeah, my first experience of it was few c through cube.

Keza
12:19
So that's an inspired cover mount.

Samuel
12:21
Yeah. Well I think the Eudace and the Giants story just proves you're the right person to write this book. I mean, that's that's for sure. Um this this is a weird thing to praise about a video game book, but the cover is really nice. Um there are plenty of nice looking game books increasingly so I think as that space becomes more competitive but Um I do think it legitimizes it as a, you know, comprehensive like work about Nintendo. I I was curious how much control you had over the design and what kind of goes into that that part of it.

Keza
12:50
Oh man, this was really the most daunting part of the sp after I'd actually written it, which was obviously the hardest part. The hardest part after that was uh when the cover designs were were coming in because every single person I've ever known who's written a book told me, just prepare to cry, prepare for them to come in and you're gonna absolutely hate it and you're gonna wanna have a little weep and then you're gonna have to have you're gonna have to gather your thoughts and feelings and put really like nice and helpful feedback together rather than just I hate it. Um and then I was amazed because literally the first two concepts they sent over, I really liked both of them. Um and the the one that we went with is this it's it's a beautiful, it's blue, it's got a very um Nintendo esque uh feel to it, you know. It's got that kind of blue sky, clouds, coins, but it's not crucially not too close to Nintendo's copyright. That's another thing actually, like the the UK publisher and the US publisher went with different covers. Um and you know, without tempting fate, the US uh publisher seems to be much less afraid of Nintendo's IP lawyers than uh than the UK people. But I thought it was a really nice interpretation of the the spirit of Nintendo and the book, right? It's a very it's it looks I think it'll stand out really nicely. But I was really pleased that I liked it. I think generally authors do get to they get to feed back on the cover, but the ultimate decision that lies with whoever is marketing your book, right? So your publisher. So I'm really pleased that I didn't end up having to just stomach a cover that I thought was you know, I was really worried, certainly in the early years when I was working at the Guardian. Every time we'd get a video game feature into print, it would be like, I remember this very well. It was a feature about Red Dead Redemption 2, and they had like the protagonist of that game, but then Pac-Man and the Space Invader and Mario in the background and it was like no Please Or it was always like uh everything just made eight bit and it's like no we really there are other aesthetics. Like we can and it used you know the sort of the idea of something being legible by by making it like you know, look like a toy as it was it that that's another really common thing in in when you see um the the visual presentation of games in in mainstream media. So I was I was very pleased that the cover is is so good and that it was it was a good idea from the beginning. Um it's also coming out in a bunch of random um other countries. countries, European countries, etcetera and I don't get any say about those covers either, so who knows, there may yet be one there may yet be one coming down the pipe that I don't like, but so far I really like both covers.

Samuel
15:10
Yeah, hopefully you don't end up with one in sort of Croatia that looks like that. if Mario was a real guy um art or something similar. As long as you avoid that you should be okay. Yeah, I really I really love that. I I encourage people to look at the covers and see the difference between the UK and the U U S one. They are striking but they're both um both very very peaceful.

Keza
15:29
I do like how big my name is in the US one I will say that.

Samuel
15:35
This is a bit more of a behind the scenes question, but relevant to this podcast. purview of behind the scenes on games journalism I guess. But how do you sell a book about video games to a publisher?

Keza
15:44
Oh man, this was this was another reason why I was quite glad that I had a a long delay in writing this book. Because I think it would have been so much harder to sell this in twenty sixteen or seventeen than it was when I eventually did sell it in twenty twenty three. And I there's two like there's two reasons for this, and it's the same reason why video game movies don't suck so much anymore, and we have good T TV shows. It's people our age have like aged into power, right? So there's 40-ish year old commissioning editors and you know people who are actually do people who are actually in control of what goes out. And also they're they're not just, you know, they're not just pitching stuff. anymore, they're actually commissioning things. So we see that I think across across uh all like TV, film and also books, we're getting people who are in commissioning editorship or TV commissioning positions who who get games, who understand them, who love them, who grew up with them themselves. And so I think that's making it a little bit easier now to pitch a video game book. And then the other thing that has happened is the pandemic. I really truly believe there was a step change in people's understanding of video games during 2020 and 2020. anyone. I think a lot of people who had sort of left games behind in their past ended up returning to them and rediscovering what was beautiful about them. I think a lot of people who'd never picked up a video game did pick it up during the pandemic. And I think that a lot of people understand the worth of games gaming and the value of it, the social value of it, much better now than they did five years ago. I've really noticed that actually. Like just in general, people who people who I talk to who aren't like huge gamers but are interested in games, a lot of them started playing in the pandemic. So yeah, I think that that's Uh and also video games made so much money during the pandemic that I think anyone would surely take notice, like any any business would look at look at the numbers there and go, Okay, so a lot of people do play these, maybe there is there is a commercial opportunity there. Um sell the book. Because I didn't really have to I didn't have to kind of couch it very much. I didn't have to go in with my here's what a video game is speech that I'm very used to from you know twenty years of trying to explain games on the BBC and things like that. Pretty much everyone I spoke to about the game already understood why Nintendo Nintendo particularly was a great topic and and and everyone was you know, there was a level of understanding there that's definitely greater than it has been in in the past, like ten years ago or five years ago even.

Matthew
18:01
Hmm.

Samuel
18:01
Oh, it's it's really interesting. So I never even thought about that really being uh a sort of long term sort of thing uh until I read this book because I I think it's just because the industry has become so much about bad news in the last few years in my head it's like it's kinda got into sort of, you know burning itself down mode mode and it doesn't feel like the games are having a particularly good time, but in terms of the what you say about people, millennials sort of being in power, decision making positions for this kind of stuff and Yeah, like um just the relationship people had with games in 2020, 2021. I I'd even really consider that being a a factor, but I can totally see why it would be.

Keza
18:41
Yeah, I mean I noticed it at the Guardian as well, like our games coverage went through the roof during like the number of people that was reading it like tripled during twenty twenty and didn't really go down again after. And Oh maybe that's that's the hard bit. But yeah, you know that's that's the audience that was picking up games at that time is people that are kind of maybe politely interested in games, you know, or played them as kids but then returned to them and and then have stayed there because they're so cool now. Like games really are really good now.

Samuel
19:06
It it is true Matthew's gonna elegantly hand the questions over to you now, um as written down in this document.

Matthew
19:16
Yeah, I know, it doesn't seem right. I sort of sit to the side making little comments like Jabba's little friend. Um at your question. Jabber. Uh Sam, of course. We're two jabber. I think we've both got a bit of jabber energy. Yes. Two jabber. A second jabber has entered the barge. Right.

Keza
19:33
Sreen and podcast the two jabbers.

Matthew
19:36
Yeah. Yeah, so I was curious, you know, obviously you s you said you've approached this, you know, you had you know, each chapter is a particular series, and then you sort of married that to a theme. I was curious if there are any chapters that you considered for this that didn't make the cut or you know, or just generally th things that sort of changed in the writing.

Keza
19:55
Yeah, th actually a lot of it changed in the writing. I found an overall arc for the book quite early and it was different from one the one I thought I was gonna find.

Matthew
20:02
Right.

Keza
20:03
Like I thought I thought it was gonna be a slightly more businessy book about you know, Nintendo's essentially the the creative secrets of Nintendo sort of thing, like the the business secrets of Nintendo. It ended up being much more of a cultural criticism book. Um and uh so a couple of things did like so two things that that went pretty early were Tetris.

Matthew
20:25
Right.

Keza
20:26
Partly because you know the book The Tetris Effect?

Matthew
20:28
Okay, yeah.

Keza
20:30
Brilliant book. Brilliant book and it it told the story of Tetris so well and with such like impeccable sourcing and stuff that I was a bit like, all I'm doing is repeating, really. A story that, you know, maybe my readers won't know but that, you know, has already been told really well. And also the Tetris story is really a business story, right? It's about, you know, it's it's a it's a cool story about especially how uh you know Hank Rogers managed to get uh Tetris out of out of the Soviet Union is a it's a wonderful story, but it wasn't one that fit into the overall arc of Nintendo that well. So Tetris went, even though it's a huge Nintendo associated with the Game Boy in a huge way. And the other one that went was Star Fox because it was just a bit too Niche in the end, even though it's a really cool story and I really could talk about Star Fox for a long time. Uh and you know you know how Star Fox was made by basically they flew a bunch of British teenagers out to Japan, right? And employed them to make Star Fox. And I just think that's such an awesome story. And it is a great story. It's a great standalone story. But again, it didn't quite fit into the sort of overall arc of like, you know, video games and how they've come into our lives and why they're still here. So that went, but it would make an amazing bonus chapter, I hope, for a for a future future.

Matthew
21:37
That has spawned that, like, it's an all-time iconic video game pit photograph of um i uh Dylan Cuthbert's wedding in the UK uh outside like a little rural church somewhere and it's just a very typical English wedding photo, except Miyamoto's there. It's so good. It's truly iconic that um there's there's another really good photo

Keza
22:00
That I love, which is um uh Andy Robinson who runs Video Games Chronicle, but he's got a picture of him sitting next to Miyamoto on the tube. And it's just it was a random encounter in London. He was in London for some for the GameCube and there's just a teenage Andy Robinson sitting next to Miyamoto on the London tube and it cracks me up every time.

Matthew
22:17
It just seems so conscious. Andy Robinson. Yeah, that's so funny. That's a brilliant photo. There's quite a an a nice little bit, I think, in the intro to the book where you talk about, you know, you hope that people will learn, even even the most hardened Nintendo fan will will learn something from this book and that there'll be something they haven't heard before. I'm kind of curious, uh, you know, if any facts jump out that you know that you learned in the writing of it that you particularly liked.

Keza
22:48
I learned so many cool facts about Nintendo like and I learned them, so I knew that other people presumably would. Although I was pleased like it got reviewed by Nintendo Life this week and they were like, This book claims it'll tell you something you don't know, which you know will surely activate any fans like Gauntlet.

Matthew
23:03
Yeah activated me. I was like, okay, come on then, let's let's see what you got.

Keza
23:07
Yeah, so I was incredibly relieved when they were like, actually we did learn some stuff. I'm like, yes, I've done it. Because that's surely the litmus test. If Nintendo Life has learned something from the book, then surely anyone would. But one of the things I didn't know was that that uh Kirby was a nickname that they gave to Satur Iwata because he would sit and eat all the snacks in all the meetings. Which I thought was an amazing fact.

Matthew
23:27
Owata's great. I love the stuff on Iwata in the book. I think it captures both his history but also like, you know, who he is as a man and who he was to the people kind of around him and you know, on a more person you know, the thick that kind of more personal version of him.

Keza
23:41
Uh yeah.

Matthew
23:42
That's that's really great.

Keza
23:43
'Cause I think who he was as a person really comes through what Nintendo has done in all the time since 2012. You know, and it's such an important like who Wata is actually does is it's not just an accessory to Nintendo story, it is a Nintendo story. And you know, I I I never he's also, you know, I very, very sadly never got to speak to Wata in person. So it was a it was a chapter that I really wanted to get right and I had l I had to use secondary sources for it, but like I tried really hard to make sure that you know, I used a lot of his voice 'cause he wrote loads. Iwata wrote constantly. He would have been an amazing games journalist, although probably did better being president of Nintendo. I don't know. Yeah. But you know, he wrote so much first hand about his philosophy. Another cool fact was that um almost n very few people at Nintendo really had much faith in the Wii Right while it was being developed. And then like all of them were like, Ugh and they you know No one could quite and then it it just s slotted into place quite suddenly, quite near the end of development. Um, that was cool fact, 'cause I I I I've always wondered how they felt about the Wii when they were making it, especially 'cause as with most video game things, they're they're not fun until the very end, right? Like a lot of games just you play a even a a version of it that's a few months old, like a build that's a few months old and it doesn't work and it's not fun. So the vision that must have been you know, they must have had such faith to just keep going with motion control technology until until it was fun. I I always wondered how that gone down inside Nintendo.

Matthew
25:03
Yeah, I always wondered if he might because he is this this s like slight outsider, you know, working at Hal who comes in and sort of takes over Nintendo, if there was ever any sentiment of like you know, oh he still hasn't kind of proven himself and then you obviously get like the DSW double whammy and after that you're like, well, we can't really argue with the guy. You do talk about like him and mi him and Miyamoto's relationship with regards to like Does Miyamoto feel any kind of jealousy or kind of pressure from this like younger upstart and uh it's quite a nice mutual respect?

Keza
25:35
Yeah, like their relationship is really cool as well. Like the friendship between Miyamoto and Iwata really came out more while I was doing research for this book And I think it's a really key kind of bit of Nintendo story actually is how these two big personalities shape the company. Um and and like because it was it was a creative force as well as a business influence, definitely.

Matthew
25:53
Yeah.

Keza
25:53
And you know, the the way in which they they played off each other, like Miyamoto is the sort of you know creative one and and Iwata being the uh the genius programmer and the way that they thought and the the conversations that they had about video games and Nintendo's future and stuff, I always th I found that just wonderful to read about. And And you know, I did also I suspected there might have been um some bad feeling at Nintendo 'cause it's very unusual in hierarchical Japanese companies for a younger person to then be given a job over someone who's kind of next in line. But uh it seems like awasa was just such a lovely person that no one had a bad word to say about it.

Samuel
26:34
I think that your chapters on their friendship actually contextualized for me why Like I d I could never entirely get my head around why Iwata in the Iwata Asks uh that were put out uh you know during his tenure at Nintendo. Sounded like they had this outsider perspective of oh and then you did this and then this happened. And he talked about it like he wasn't involved and then of course he wasn't involved, but he is as cu he is as cu as curious about the inner workings of Nintendo as anyone. And I don't think I really understood that really twigged what his particular perspective and the context of those I wata ask articles until um I read your book. So I found that super useful in that respect.

Keza
27:13
Sorry Matthew, next question Keep it moving. Keep it moving, Matthew.

Matthew
27:18
I was going safe of uh you know, th there's loads in this book that I I hadn't heard before either. Um I actually really liked the stuff on Hannafuda at the start. I really like 'cause you you you talk to this chap who's built like a a sort of weird shrine to sort of pre-games console Nintendo and has all collects all these cards and i you know, I think it's a bit of their history which is e quite easily like dashed off, certainly I have, where you're like, Oh, they made these things and and you don't really think of them as as innovative a company until they start maybe making like physical toys and then games, but actually it shows that they were quite forward thinking and I think there's a bit where it describes like a like a weird set of cards that you put into like a little television frame so that you can it looks like you're watching a little television but it's actually the picture on the back of the card so it's like what the hell was going on with that? It's crazy.

Keza
28:10
Yeah. There's so much of that going on in that period of Nintendo's history as well. Just like random ideas. Um but it was just analogue games rather than digital ones obviously. made uh um they made a set of electronic bongos like well before Donkey Konga. Turns out the lineage of the Donkey Konga bongos goes way back to the sixties.

Matthew
28:30
It was destined to happen. Who doesn't love an electronic bongo? Another neat thing from this is you know you obviously you have all these interviews that you've done over the years to draw and like you said earlier it's a real who's who of like particularly like modern Nintendo, which is which is exciting. But I was curious if there was like if if you could have made any interview happen for this book that m that maybe didn't But you know, what would it be? Who would you who would you really love to talk to?

Keza
28:55
Oh, dude, Satoshi Tajiri of Pokemon. He has not spoken to anybody since a nineteen ninety-nine interview with Time magazine in which they basically characterized him as a monster. peddling like addictive gambling to kids. And it's it's the most shocking. Like when I was reading uh so the Pokemon chapter deals a little bit with the kind of moral panic around video games in the 90s.

Matthew
29:18
Yeah

Keza
29:18
And when I was reading researching that, I was reading back at all this kind of contemporary coverage of um video games in general and just the sort of like the combination of dismissiveness and ridicule with which games were talked about, I'd kind of forgotten it because it it sort of seeped its way. Way into me when I was a kid and a teenager, like I was very defensive about games for a long time. And that's why, because people were genuinely like insulting about video games for for a long time, especially the mainstream press. And so yeah, this uh there was this interview with Tajiri in which he's just described as this like hollow eyed creature. Um um and his game, you know, inspires I think the quote is the most troubling fanaticism in the youth. And it's like, you know, crazy, crazy stuff. It's Pokemon for God's sake, can you think of anything more benign? But but yeah, basically since then Tajiri has become exquisitely mysterious. I think he lives on an island. I think he literally lives on an island. Um he comes into Game Freak now and then, but he's not been like um he's not been significantly involved, I don't believe, in in the making of the game. games for some time. I want to know what his life is like. I want to know how he feels about Pokemon now. I am desperate to know how he felt about the Pokemania stuff. Um he also had a quite interesting Young Life he ran a game fanzine with Kensugimori, who was another of Pokemon's creators, and they just decided they were like, Oh these games aren't good enough, we're gonna make our own. You know, Game Freak, their their game fanzine sell tens of thousands of copies in Japan. I just wanna know about all that and And I really doubt that anyone will ever speak to him again, which is really sad. But if i if if I could speak to anybody still alive, I think he'd be the one. And then of course I would have loved to have spoken to Awata and Gum Gumpa Yokoi as well would have been a fascinating interview.

Matthew
30:56
Yeah. Jerry's uh such an interesting character 'cause I feel like he came to fame like just sort of pre-internet and there's just so little record of him and you know, uh even some of the, you know, bigger names, this there's so precious little about many Nintendo figures, but he in particular is yeah, very, very strange.

Keza
31:16
I ended up finding most of what I learned about Tegiri and his life and his kind of personality from a I think it was it was only in French. There was a French manga, a French biograph Graphical manga book about Tajiri. And that that's where I ended up getting most of my information about him. I could find almost nothing else.

Matthew
31:34
Well, you know, you've you've you you know you went deep for this one, so I sure did.

Keza
31:38
I'm I'm glad I took French now.

Matthew
31:41
This isn't actually this next question's not really to do with the book, it's just more of a general Nintendo opinion. I thought there was quite a lot of stuff about handheld games in this and how much they m they they meant to you and Obviously the Switch has like sort of cemented Nintendo's sort of financial future and given us loads of amazing games. It's definitely a positive thing. I love the Switch. But I do wonder if you at all miss the the kind of handheld strand of their publishing that doesn't really happen anymore because everything sort of lives in this The same console.

Keza
32:13
Yeah, I really do. Um I I think that it would be really cool if Nintendo would make downloadable smaller games again.

Matthew
32:21
You know?

Keza
32:21
In the way that you know, 'cause a lot of DS games were they weren't oh I don't wanna say throwaway, but they were smaller skills. scale, you know? And things like uh I know y you ha share my affection for electroplankton and stuff like that from the DS era where it's like that just wouldn't happen on the switch. And I'm like, why not though? Why isn't there like a snack sized Nintendo brief l like a little Xbox Live Arcade style series of of Nintendo I would love to I would love to play some more stuff like that. I do feel like we've lost something in the consolidation.

Matthew
32:53
It's like the one bit of the Yeah, the Switch success story. It's like the s the s shadow side of it is that they're obviously not encouraged to do that stuff anymore but Or all the all the the ideas make their way into the big games instead?

Keza
33:05
Like rather than becoming their own thing. Like y you play a Mario these days and you can see there's like a million different game mechanics in it. And you're like, well, maybe in a previous era some of those would have turned into other games, but now they all get put into Mario.

Matthew
33:18
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that's true. I know that you went to the Nintendo Museum over in Kyoto. I'd really like to just hear your thoughts on it, like you know, tell us a bit about your visit to it. But also I was curious how you felt about how Nintendo tell their own story these days and whether you think they're like doing a good enough job of it.

Keza
33:39
Yeah, I feel really strongly about this, that that they don't do a good enough job of it. Which this is partly why I wanted to do it, to be honest. 'Cause someone's got to. Like this is really vital cultural history, right? Vital. And I think someone really someone's got to do it. And I'm really pleased that I got to do it. Um but like bringing bringing uh you know, I Iwata was really passionate about documenting Nintendo's internal workings and its history and I don't think that's carried on at all since since Sawata passed away. And so we don't have really any kind of a window into Nintendo now in the way that we did in the in the 2000s and and the early 2010s. And I just think it's really important. I think it's important that somebody is is not just cataloguing it but um you know asking the questions you know and getting answers about things because these people are in their seventies. Like no one else knows.

Matthew
34:28
Yeah.

Keza
34:29
About what it was like in in in Nintendo's early days. Like in Nintendo in the sixties and seventies, that's that's information that i is uh gonna die with with the people who were there at some point in the next couple of decades and I just It's important that we, you know, try our best to to catalogue it before before that before that happens. Um and I think Nintendo's version of its history is a very corporate version, which is understandable. any company would be the same pretty much. But it sees you know, if you look at the Nintendo Museum, I went there when it opened and it is a it's a product history museum, basically. So and lots of Japanese um brand museums are like this, right? Um, the Toyota Museum is similar. You don't really learn anything about the people who made them at all. You don't really see any names or any stories. You see a bunch of finished products displayed in a in a chronology that you can kind of infer something from. One of the things I found interesting about the Nintendo Museum was that all the games uh the box art for all the different regions was displayed for each one and you could see like when they started to all become the same. Right. Um and that was really interesting because you could sort of see the globalization of of Nintendo start to happen um and of games in general actually because obviously everything used to be different in Japan, America and Europe, didn't it? Um so that and and then you can sort of infer from the way that things are grouped together, but you're there like, you know, doing Nintendo detective work in your head in this museum, like, oh why have they put that next to that and why is this This all you know, why is this corner where this is and that corner where that thing you know. They have uh they have at the back they have all of Nintendo's pre video game stuff with brilliant commercials from the nineteen seventies, like Japanese TV commercials for like baby strollers and rice cookers and board games. and all this other stuff that they made. And I would I spent ages there just watching those because I'd never seen that before. Yeah, that sounds great. Yeah, so they obviously do have like an archive and you know it there's also a piece of the museum that's behind a big glass screen where they sometimes put like unseen prototypes and things. So when I was there they had a few prototypes of the Wii controller. And I was beside I was beside myself. I was very excited about that. But you know that's so they obviously have documented it. Like I have heard from many sources that Nintendo's internal document Documentation is really really tight, like they have everything documented. So they obviously have this archive and the Nintendo Museum is one way that they've chosen to show some of this archive, right?

Matthew
36:48
Yeah.

Keza
36:48
Um and like downstairs there's all the interactive stuff, so there's like an interactive card. game whose name I always get wrong but I think it's called Hyakuninishun which is like a poetry matching game that they used to do on on cards and you can play a version of that that's like augmented reality where you walk around with your phone. And then there's a light gun game with shooting Goombas. You can use the ultra hand, the old gripper toy, to play a game where you grab pokeballs. Um and there's like it's it's it's it's and there's a room full of Nintendo's emulated versions of Nintendo's old consoles, it's like an arcade. So that's where Nintendo's sort of like hands-on fun history comes out and there's like one display down there which shows Nintendo' Nintendo's controllers and consoles sort of webbing out from each other are like a genealogy of ideas and it's like, aha, see, that's that's the insight I want from this. But this that's one display, everything else is more like a product museum. So I think Nintendo understands that its history is valuable at least though. Because it keeps releasing its games, it keeps you know, it it's clearly has a lot of respect for its own for its own history. But in terms of insight, it's not providing that. That's why I kinda wanted to write this. I wanted to provide the insight that we you know you won't get from a corporate version of history.

Matthew
37:56
How do you find Nintendo? people when you interview them. You've interviewed way more Nintendo figures than I have. Like I've only ever really talked to like a couple of people really. And I'm interested if you feel like you're getting uh like a true insight from those them in those interviews 'cause they feel very open in the in the excerpts you've put in the book. and you know on the sliding scale of like very corporate PR interviews to something which feels a bit more sort of genuine and open and uh you know, an an opportunity to actually maybe move the needle a little bit on what you know about them and their games. I'd say the Nintendo interviews tend to feel more towards that like positive end and It's just kinda curious if you got it had the same sort of reading.

Keza
38:38
Yeah, I mean a lot of it is about the language barrier, I think.

Matthew
38:42
Right.

Keza
38:42
Um I speak I speak Japanese not fluently anymore, but good enough. Um and so when I'm in an interview with a Japanese developer I can understand. understand what they're saying enough to be able to sort of tune the questions as you would when you're talking to right someone you share a language with, right? So I I think part of it is that like being able to I I would I would I'm very curious as to why a Japanese writer hasn't done a book like this and maybe maybe they are, maybe they will soon. Uh but I think that that does a lot of the stiltedness that you sometimes get from from interviewing Japanese creatives, a lot of it does come I think from language barrier. Right. Um but then also it's also so tightly controlled Nintendo's very tightly controlled by PR and marketing always has been and Nintendo in Japan really what what Japan says goes right. So I've worked with you know IGN IKOTACU obviously um and having like Nintendo of America can be really excited about something and really keen to get you access, it's not happening unless Japan decides they're on board. And similarly with Europe, like the people there can all be like super psyched for something, but there's ultimately it all goes back to Japan. Um so like when you're trying to arra it took me years to arrange the interview with Miyamoto that features prominently in this book for instance like years actual years and then when you do the interview obviously the PR marketing people kind of want it to be about something in particular like you know the newest game that's out or the newest console and what you're trying to do is sort of like, you know, do enough of that so that you so that you know everyone's happy, but also try and get some insight right into what you actually want to talk about, maybe the past or the future, which is even harder to get anyone to talk about. Uh but I think I was helped out by the fact that a lot of the things I was talking about, certainly in the more recent interviews, i it was in the past, right? So people didn't feel so restricted by what they're allowed to say, I think.

Matthew
40:28
Yeah.

Keza
40:28
Um Shinya Takahashi and Hisashi Nogami were two particularly great interviews. They kept joking with each other like a little comedy duo.

Matthew
40:36
Right.

Keza
40:37
And it was just a really fun energy to witness. Um and they've been involved in a million different Nintendo games between them and just you know, they were they were just I got I got more of a kind of feeling for what it was like to work at Nintendo from those two than I think from anybody else I spoke to.

Matthew
40:52
Ah, that's great. I'm very jealous. Um I've just had endless stilted interviews with j Japanese developers that um haven't really got me anywhere.

Samuel
41:01
So I've had plenty of those too a glaring lack of Charles Martine in your book though, I guess I'm on I will say that. So uh Matthew has got you beat on our front. Yes.

Keza
41:10
Um Well Reggie wrote his own book, didn't he? We don't need to ask Reggie anything, he's already written it down.

Matthew
41:17
We all know that you wanted to pack in Wii Sports with the Wii, we get it. Um I'm curious how interested you are in wider Nintendo. Maybe more as a fan than than as a journalist, but you know, these days there is so much more to it. You know, it's the films, the theme parks what seems like endless merch and people going to the the theme parks in the museum to buy the endless merch. Do you go in for all that? You does that interest you or are you kind of like a games purist?

Keza
41:48
Um, I would say less so. Like it it interests me a lot less. You know? Yeah. Like I'll go see the Mario movies with my kids, you know. Sure. They're nice. I don't feel very invested in them. Um the theme park, I have to say, man, like so I went on this trip to Japan Japan in 2023 to interview Mimoto. And I also went to the Osaka Nintendo Land theme park. And when I walked into Nintendo headquarters I was expecting to feel this like rush of something. Right. But I really didn't. I didn't, 'cause it's just an office building at the end of the day. Um and I was in pro mode. Like I was in I was like I was properly like or head in the game, this is really important. So I I didn't have any room for emotion. at all. But then the next day after doing the interview, after the pressure was off, I went to the Osaka theme park and I nearly cried. I honestly found it so moving, like walking through the Osaka Nintendo world. It just really brought it to life in this way that I really I was expecting it not to be so cool. And you know the the Nintendo fan in me really came out in that moment. I felt kind of just really emotional about it. And so like I do I do think that uh the games for me are what I will always be interested in. But there you know, some of this other stuff is really cool. Like the theme park is really cool. Cool. I hope the new Pokemon theme park isn't rubbish. It seems like people quite liked it when they went to see the opening last week. 'Cause I'm gonna go to that with my kids at some point this year. That stuff's lovely. The merch I really ca I've got too much stuff dude. I've got I've got children in my house. My house is full of things. I don't Need more merch. Um, I have some kind of prized possessions um from you know from years of Nintendo collecting that I haven't gotten rid of and never will, but I'm I'm not someone who has like a massive games room full of stuff.

Matthew
43:24
Right, right.

Keza
43:25
I never have been that guy. Um Um and I remain not that guy. Nonetheless though, when I went to the Nintendo department store, oh my god, the quality of the stuff was really great. I bought like all this Animal Crossing kitchenware. I was like, this is great. This is practical. I can use these cereal bowls and coffee grinders.

Matthew
43:42
Yeah. Well, you know, yeah, yeah. They make good stuff. Our house Catherine has has bought way more merch in than than I have, um, when she came back from the Nintendo Museum. She had all these cool things and

Keza
43:54
Yeah, I mean Catherine will massively contradict me now because she witnessed me in the shop at the Nintendo Museum running around like losing your mind. Yeah, I was honestly 'cause they had they had um they had these keychains with miniature Nintendo controllers on. I love miniature stuff, that's my weakness. I was well into that. Um I came out of that museum shop with um really a lot of stuff that I didn't need. We all got caught up in the moment, I think.

Matthew
44:17
Yeah. I the miniature stuff's okay. I I think when Cathr Catherine didn't buy anything massive at the museum because she didn't have the storage space, but when she left Eurogamer, they bought her like a big plushy Wii remote. Um which I think came from that museum gift shop. So now we've got, yeah, a massive Wii remote just in the house, which is obviously good.

Keza
44:40
I was tempted by the massive plush Nintendo 64 controller, I must say, but I was like, seriously what where's that gonna live? Where's that gonna live? Is that gonna be on my couch? It's not gonna be on my couch.

Matthew
44:49
Yeah. I agree completely. Even though I do also love the giant plushree remote, uh should Catherine listen to this.

Samuel
44:55
So um Um I was really um I really regretted not buying the um cuddly oat cheese when I went to the um Nintendo shop in um Shibuya, that was um that was a terrible error. Oh my god.

Keza
45:07
Did you guys get into amiibo?

Samuel
45:09
Uh a bit, yeah, a little bit a few years ago. What about you, Matthew?

Matthew
45:13
Not really. I I could just see that way madness lay and I I've I mean I've got we've got a few. Again, it's more Catherine's thing than than anything else, but I mean they are beautifully made. Like if if If someone wants to say, I'll give you a complete collection of them, I wouldn't say no, but I'm not gonna commit to trying to build that collection.

Keza
45:33
Matthew, that's hilarious because that's what actually happened to me. Right. I was staying away from amiibo because I knew that I just couldn't I couldn't get into it. I couldn't get into it. And then like a crack dealer, a friend of mine just gave me. He was like I I can't collect these anymore, have them and he just gave me like fifty amiibo.

Matthew
45:52
Oh my god.

Keza
45:53
And I was I was I was like, No, you've given me at once the best and worst gift you could ever have given me 'cause now obviously I'm gonna be searching for the last seven that you haven't got.

Matthew
46:02
Yeah.

Keza
46:03
And that's gonna be my life now. Uh so I did end up I had I had to get rid of them in the end because I was I just could I can't trust myself with amiibo. Do you know what I mean? Like it's it's too it's too it's like laser targeted at like collector brain and also Nintendo brain and I just can't have that. I can't have that in my life. I c I can't afford it. Yeah. So I did I ended up giving them away in turn.

Matthew
46:23
It's like it's like the tape, the cursed videotape in the ring.

Keza
46:26
Yeah, the collection curse.

Matthew
46:27
You just have to pass it on before you die.

Keza
46:30
Eventually be crushed under the weight of Code for plastic.

Samuel
46:33
Yeah, yeah. My favourite one I ever had was the the dog that I got with the Twilight Princess H D s collector's edition that could then be summoned into the wolf that could be summoned into Breath of the Wild and he'd just run around attacking birds to you. That was like genuinely I would be angry if um I didn't have that and they'd gated like that you know, like a a wolf companion behind an amiibo but I forgot that the amiibo did anything in the games, like I'd actually forgotten that they did anything they unlocked stuff.

Keza
47:01
'Cause the new Zelda ones um They they unlock actually important stuff, I think.

Matthew
47:05
Definitely I know in m Metroid Prime Four there's a there's a figure of Silux, the um iconic villain of Metroid Prime Four. And who I think if you've Scan him, you get like a you get an exclusive cutscene that shows like, you know, why he's such a rotter, basically. Which otherwise you have to earn by I think you have to like hundred percent every bit of scanning and every item and all this stuff. So it's like a shortcut to someone's backstory that you have to buy and scan this toy. if you want to know what drives him, which I don't know if I do really.

Keza
47:41
No, I can do without that TVH, might just look it up on YouTube.

Samuel
47:44
Yeah, that's exactly what I did. Um I'd I'd a couple more questions, Kes, before we take a quick break. And um come back with the last part of the episode. But the spiciest question I guess I had from reading your book was whether you think Nintendo mythologizes Crunch in a way that means they avoid the scrutiny a Western studio would get for similar practices. I thought this while reading about the creation of Ocarina of Time and the nineties in particular, as well as the creation of the original Metroid, which sounded like hell on earth for the people making it. And then also Metroid Prime's development, which is that's pretty well documented how bad. things got at um at Retro Studios. But yeah, it's um work-life balance had a pretty brutal on some of those projects. I guess I just wanted to know what you you made of this while while studying Nintendo.

Keza
48:27
Yeah, it's it's one of those things that you 'cause when basically the story of every single video game made in the eighties and nineties and early two thousands is a bunch of almost exclusively men slept under their desk and ate pizza slash ramen for A year. And then the game opened. We've done this a lot. Like we've talked to a lot of people who make games in this era. That's the story every time. And so it was very, very, very normalized. I don't know if you've uh either of you have read Jason. Schreier's story about bli um book about Blizzard and the history of Blizzard, but that is Blizzard too, you know, it's it's a bunch of really passionate dudes just working themselves to death. And that is just it's so ubiquitous at this time in the games industry. And I think like I I d I don't know whether Nintendo was any better or worse than any the other any other company at the time, but they were all really bad for that. And I do think that Nintendo these days doesn't kind of I mean at least I have not heard from anyone that uh they still have these kind of insane crunch policies and I think it's unlikely that they do. But yeah, I think that uh there is a romanticization, isn't there, of you know, how hard everyone worked and how much went into it that I think we have all become a bit wise to over time. Um and that, you know, these days if if if a Nintendo developer came out and was like I slept under my desk to make Metro Prime 4, you'd feel very A, you'd feel very sorry for them if it was Metro Prime 4 that resulted from that. And B, I don't think that people would yeah, people wouldn't respond to it in the same way. So yeah, I think that I don't know if they were worse than anybody else. But certainly Japanese Japanese working culture has always been like incredibly long hours and I would be very surprised if Nintendo was any different. I think Nintendo probably still, you know, requires a lot from from employees today. But as for that, like like hardcore crunch, like not seeing your family for months crunch, I think that's probably no longer a thing at Nintendo and hopefully no longer a thing elsewhere in in Japan or in the games industry.

Samuel
50:23
For sure. Um so you It took ten years from conceptualising this book to getting it on shelves. Do you think you'd write another book about video games after this?

Keza
50:32
Hmm. Yes, I would have to pick something I wouldn't get bored of. I think the thing is with journalism, no matter what you're writing about, it's over quite fast. You know, like even if you even if you lose interest in a story you're doing, um you can generally see it through. If you lose interest in a book halfway through, you are cooked.

Matthew
50:47
Like uh it would be really hard.

Keza
50:50
So I I wouldn't I wouldn't take on another book that I didn't feel really passionate about for some reason. or another. Something I'd really like to do is write books about video games for kids. Um because I think that y we all grew up with reading a lot about games, right? In magazines. And I don't think that kids today have that. They don't have like a a friendly, authoritative, knowledgeable adult voice necessarily to read about games and instead they're on YouTube and Twitch and like I d I d I think there's a lot of parents who'd prefer their children weren't getting all their video game uh information knowledge and entertainment from from YouTube and Twitch. I think that it would be really cool to have a series of books about games for for kinda kids. And my own children are, you know, eight and wait, no they're not, they're nine and six now. They're really interested in games and they have a lot of and I'm like not You know, having having access to um a a games journalist parent is not is not an experience that most kids have, right? But I'm sure there are a lot of other children out there who have like lots of really interesting questions about games. So I would love to write kids books about video games, that would be something I could find. feel really excited about. Um and then I've also wrote, you know, up about ten years ago I published a book about Dark Souls and that was just a mono it was a monomania thing. Like I was obsessed with that game, I was obsessed with the people who made it and I was able to like sustain my interest in that because I was just obsessed with that one thing. So I think if I wrote the next one it might be another like really specific one, much to the delight of my publisher, I'm sure.

Samuel
52:20
Doshin the Giant, the uh definitive guide.

Keza
52:22
Exactly that. But yeah, I would do another one. It did it did nearly send me mad, but I would do another one. It's very rewarding.

Samuel
52:29
Yeah, that makes sense. The uh the I think the the whole kind of like thing you say about if you lose interest halfway through you're cooked. I never really thought about it like that. And uh I'd think that would be oddly devastating to reach that point, um, after putting in hundreds of hours um to reach that moment.

Keza
52:52
And they know they won't create something particularly good if they're not interested. So it does happen.

Samuel
52:56
Yeah, for sure. Uh so you include a list of your favourite Nintendo games at the end of the book. And I won't spoil it, 'cause I definitely think people should discover your list uh for themselves. Um but you do have Breath of the Wild much higher than Tears of the Kingdom. Uh on this podcast that is a contentious subject between myself and Matthew. And Um where do you stand on petting them against each other? 'Cause you never really do that in the book.

Keza
53:18
The thing that I really enjoyed about writing this book is it was literally just me. Nobody could tell me what to write or think. And I got to like the the um the so this this uh list of the fifty best Nintendo games, it was kind of a joke to myself originally. I started writing just notes on Nintendo games uh to myself for reference, like almost a glossary for myself as I was doing a search for the book and And by the end I just had thousands and thousands of words about Nintendo games and I thought some of this is quite fun. So I thought I'd put together like a top fifty just almost as an in-joke to myself, and then I ended up thinking it was it was gonna be entertaining to share it with the world. So I ranked it purely on how I felt when I was playing them. And the only difference between like the main difference between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom for me there was that Breath of the Wild felt so new and exciting and unbelievable. Tears of the Kingdom felt awesome, loved that game, but it didn't have that you know it was it was the same high rule. And so that that was the difference for me. But then again I still don't understand how they made Tears of the Kingdom run at all. I don't understand how that game works. Like it's a technical marvel. It's a mystery to me.

Matthew
54:19
And so better, that's right, yes. Yes, very good, very good. It's so nice to have someone in my corner for once.

Keza
54:30
Well, I mean I I can't defend Skyward Sword with you, Matthew, but I will. I'll go to bat for two.

Matthew
54:35
Hey I th I think you liked Skyward Sword originally.

Keza
54:39
I liked it.

Matthew
54:41
I didn't I think I think a lot of people turned on Skyward Sword and and called me out to dry, so Amazing.

Samuel
54:49
There are like five to ten things on this podcast that will come up forever while we're doing it and will never ever be uh resolved. And yeah, those two Zelda games are definitely among them. Okay, well um we'll take a quick break, Kze, but then we've got one last thing to end the podcast with. So uh yes, we'll be back in a moment. Welcome back to the podcast. So, a short section to end with here. Matthew, you asked uh Keza to make a list, didn't you? What was the thinking there?

Matthew
55:48
Well, so originally I thought, oh, we can talk about it Keza's top. Nintendo games of all time. But uh I hadn't had the book at this point and so I wasn't aware that it has this big list at the end and we didn't want to spoil that and It would probably be a bit mad just to sort of repeat that and obviously people should buy the book and read the list. So we thought instead to talk about uh Kesas ten underrated Nintendo games. Whatever that means. Such a good s you're such a good sport cursor for doing this.

Keza
56:15
I'm so excited. I'm so excited to get very nerdy about it.

Samuel
56:18
Oh nice. Well well please take it away.

Keza
56:20
Alright. Here we go. Dagasu Band Brothers.

Matthew
56:24
Oh Classic.

Keza
56:25
Or Jam with the Band. as it was in in the States. It's it's like rock band, but on your DS. Um and it sounds like shit, but apart from that, it's uh it's like rock band on your DS. I love that game. I got it um I imported a Japanese DS when I was a teenager because again I just used to go to enormous lengths. And I I only had that game, I only had Jam of the Band, and you you know, you play on your DS like a little MIDI synthesizer. You can connect it with up to I think s six six or seven other DSs and you all play your part.

Matthew
56:54
Yeah.

Keza
56:54
Absolutely great little game that nobody played.

Matthew
56:57
How do you feel about its mascot, the very sexy Barbara Ba the very sexy Barbara Bath.

Keza
57:03
Do you know what? In the Nintendo Museum they have a big collage of uh like characters from Nintendo games, like hundreds of them in in the in the opening and I I Immediately was that it's Barbara Bat from Daiga Suban Brothers. Let nobody else get that one. Um all right. I'm gonna I'm gonna completely pivot for the next one and say Cheby Robo.

Matthew
57:23
Oh, oh nice An Ash Day favourite.

Keza
57:25
Yeah, I recently played the GameCube version on Nintendo Switch's online service. Great game. It's just it's so weird. It's a lovely little game and I think it kind of 'cause it's n you know, it was a classic seven out of ten at the time but I think in retrospect it's actually Really sweet and I think it's it's adorable that the robot is carrying around its little plug. No that feels very nostalgic now.

Samuel
57:46
Agreed. This is widely available now as well, in a way it just simply wasn't even like a year ago. So that's that's really cool.

Keza
57:53
Hundred percent, yeah. Like a lot of these games you would have to go to insane lengths of like digging through bargain bins in Japanese retro game stores to find. And now you can just play them on Switch online. Alright, Pac-Man versus.

Samuel
58:07
Don't just spot it, but it's made your main list as well, right, in the book.

Keza
58:09
It did, yeah. It's a it's a Miyamoto designed Pac-Man game. And it's Exactly as good as that suggests. But it's uh it made use of the Game Boy advance and GameCube connectivity in that three of you would be on little screens as the ghosts and then one of you was Pac-Man on the big screen. Or the other way around, one of you is Pac-Man on the on the little screen and the rest of you would be. The ghost on the big screen. And it's just a little piece of genius. And it also it resurfaced in Mario Chase in Nintendo Land, which is another underrated classic. Such a fun multiplayer game. It's just it's just great. I remember uh when the Wii U came out, my stepson was about ten And we had uh about six little boys playing Mario Chase all day one day, just squealing with delight. It's a it's a real winner.

Matthew
58:55
I love that game. I love that. I I of I s sometimes wondered if Wii U was like uh the conviction that the you know what they were doing with the Game Boy Advance link up was was so good and so underappreciated that they're like if we make this just, you know, the core selling point of this thing, people will finally see our genius and then it didn't really happen, even though it is amazing.

Keza
59:19
No, I th I think you're right. Like that that idea of like the two screen connectivity sort of runs throughout like quite a lot of Nintendo history. It just keeps coming back. I think you get the impression is one of those ideas that Miyamoto really likes. And so you just keep seeing it over and over again until it works. Stubborn old goat the next one is the Game Boy camera.

Matthew
59:41
Oh.

Keza
59:42
I uh think that that is such a prescient piece of technology. Like years and years and years and years before the smartphone camera. Having a little uh a little pocket camera where you could, you know, make ridiculous little pictures and edit like it's you know this is stuff that Instagram does now in stories. Every time I see Instagram stories, I'm like, you know, it reminds me of the Game Boy camera. interface. I just think it's one of those pieces of tech that was just like a like a total anachronism. It was really before its time. And I had many, many, many, many hours of fun with it as a kid too.

Matthew
01:00:14
Yeah. Th two things I loved about the Game Boy camera was the uh people used to send in the pictures to N sixty four magazine and they had a gallery of what they'd call muties of like, look at all these muties people have sent in and it was just people pulling horrible faces and then sticking like googly eyes on them.

Keza
01:00:32
I remember that distinctly.

Matthew
01:00:35
D did you do it? No. Oh right.

Keza
01:00:37
I never send one in, but I I've read Nine Sixty Four magazine religiously.

Matthew
01:00:41
Um Uh and uh even though it never came to fruition, the idea that the Game Boy camera m might be used to let you scan your face into perfect dark was rumoured at one point or was going to be a feature and Oh, I would have loved that. You know. Just to be able to like shoot my shoot my weird polygonal brother in the face.

Keza
01:01:01
Yeah, it would have been really fun. I think it's one of those little Nintendo kind of technological offshoots that doesn't get much appreciation, but I think it's it's a great thing. It's and it looks really cool as well with its little eyeball.

Samuel
01:01:11
Yeah, I loved it. I I coveted this as a kid 'cause a the a the boy across the road from me had it and just it it was like the epitome of Yeah sort of have and have not to me and for that particular Christmas. Um because he did take one picture and print it out and give it to me and I was like, this is incredibly precious to me because I cannot have this thing. So um I totally get totally get why this would Have a a special place, Kaza.

Keza
01:01:35
Great, well that one gets approved. That one's got the stand for approval. Um I was I was struggling to pick a Zelda game. Okay. 'Cause I think there are there are four equally underappreciated Zelda games. I think four swords is underappreciated because literally seven people People ever played it as intended with all of the Link Cables and Game Boys. I think the Link Between Worlds is underappreciated because it was such an obvious bridge between Old Zelda and Breath of the Wild new Zelda. Um and I just think that's really interesting. But I think like the two that are most underappreciated And so they're what's making the list are Oracle of Ages and Seasons.

Matthew
01:02:07
Oh classic.

Keza
01:02:08
Yeah, which of course were um Game Boy Zelda games set in parallel dimensions and they kind of fed into each other. So if you played both, uh they were different enough that it was worth playing. both but that you know different characters and and and places would show up in both games. I thought it was so cool. It was such a it was such an interesting theme, like the theme of parallel worlds like that. And also, fun fact, it was uh Hidamara Fujibayashi who now directs Zelda series. Those were his first games he worked on them at Capcom. They were the first games he directed and then Nintendo hired him off the back of them. So without those games we would not have Breath of the Wild.

Matthew
01:02:40
I like that people complain about Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom not having proper dungeons where you're like, this guy made so many frickin' dungeons in those Horaco games. Like they're like Zelda Dungeons the game. Uh yeah.

Keza
01:02:53
And they're such interesting dungeons as well, aren't they? Like they've got they've got there's so many like little unique gameplay mechanics based around time or season that I just thought it was really cool. Yeah and I re I re I re replayed a bit of them recently and I they were still just really interesting. They hold up really well.

Matthew
01:03:07
Absolutely brilliant. He also of course did Skyward Sword, which is why it's amazing.

Keza
01:03:14
That was also a bridge, you know, the the kind of uh I feel like Tears of the Kingdom's sort of like uh the the sky islands and then the depths below and then the high rule in the middle, I'm like, oh that's what he was going for in Sky Resort, but it didn't work. But this time it works.

Samuel
01:03:30
I w I wish I could have seen Matthew's face when he got to the bit about the dev saying, Ah, we've we could see online comments after Skyward Sawed that this series got a bit familiar and stale and I Just imagine your blood rising massive.

Matthew
01:03:43
I don't like the idea of them agreeing with that and then thinking that everyone else who said it was good was just like some lame sycophant. Because it wasn't that They weren't thinking about you. They were like, Oh man Imagine being a a goon he gave that a ten.

Keza
01:03:59
Sorry, the feature book. Fujibayashi did actually say that to me, Matthew, but I didn't want to Oh okay, great. Didn't wanna put in the book to publicly humiliate anyone. Um th the next the next game I've put on this list um is Endless Ocean. Ooh. Not a Nintendo developed game, but a Nintendo published one. It was a very chill game about just diving in the ocean. And chilling out with sea creatures. And it was it was very it was a very uh it was one of those games that came out at the time when uh people had much more strong opinions about what was and wasn't a game, you know? Yeah. Um and because Endless Ocean was quite vibrant. Vibes based. I don't think it got appreciated at the time because it didn't have enough game stuff in it. It didn't have enough goals and, you know, levels and things to collect. It was just very vibes based. But it's actually a very peaceful and interesting uh game. And there was there was there was another one, there was a sequel as well, which was also pretty good. Yeah. Um but yeah, at the time it got completely dismissed.

Matthew
01:04:54
Yeah. I I I did I did like Endless Ocean. I was always surprised that it felt like something that would need like crazy photorealistic graphics to pull off. You know, and it was like Wii Era when you know 360 and Pierce 3 were doing their thing. But I still thought it had It captured enough of underwater, I guess, to to feel impressive. Didn't it have like some like Enya esque soundtrack as well?

Keza
01:05:18
It did. I think it lit was it literally Enya? I can't remember. It might have literally been Enya, but it was re yeah, it's really it's really it really surprised.

Matthew
01:05:32
I've I might have told this on the podcast before, but When uh CVG used to upload Endgamers reviews, they'd just strip the magazine of assets and put them on so it would have the text and it would have all the screenshots from the page. And the lead image for the Endless Ocean Review on Wii on CVG was this incredible photorealistic shot of Dolphins jumping it through the water and people in and comments were like wow that looks amazing for a Wii game, like what is going on with that And what they'd done was that was the backing image on the page that the art editor had used just as like a texture. So it wasn't actually from the game, it was literally stock photography of dolphins. And they'd just stripped that out and gone, Yeah, that'll do, and stuck it up. So um

Keza
01:06:16
That that's setting unrealistic expectations for the graphical capabilities of Endless Ocean. Yeah. Jerry, ready for another one?

Samuel
01:06:24
Yeah. Yeah, go for it.

Keza
01:06:26
Another not quite Nintendo game, but I can't ever go anywhere without mentioning it, is Diddy Kong Racing. Honestly think it's better than Mario Kart of the Era. I think it's better than I do I think it's better than Mario Kart sixty four, Sue me. I think it's great. And I think that nobody remembers it as much as they should. That's my p every single time I play any creature.

Matthew
01:07:00
Yeah, I'm not gonna That is that is true. I know I know people are very attached to the adventure mode. His mates were a sorry bunch.

Keza
01:07:07
They were. They're really British, a really British collection of characters. Pipsy the mouse? Yeah, just uh t tip

Matthew
01:07:16
Oh come on.

Keza
01:07:17
Just as protect up actually. He's he's pretty great.

Samuel
01:07:21
Yeah. I got I g I get it's bad, Matthew. I get excited when people say things I don't want to upset you now. Obviously because uh cherished guests And we respect everything she brings to this podcast.

Matthew
01:07:43
What it really means is that all the people I've Terrorized in our Discord for liking Diddy Kong Racing are gonna be like, yes, someone's on our side, someone he's gotta listen to. He won't listen to us, but he will listen to Keza. And that is true.

Keza
01:07:57
I think um there was another really obscure PlayStation game. I think it might have been called Beatle Adventure Racing.

Matthew
01:08:03
Oh yeah.

Keza
01:08:04
But it was uh another kind of similar thing was sort of an open world-ish uh adventure game design. So it's just a genre of game that I think is under explored. Like open world racing adventure games. Forza Horizon, obviously, but Forza Horizon doesn't have Whispig.

Matthew
01:08:19
What I like about Beetle Adventure Racing is you don't have to know anything about cars because they're all Beatles. So you don't have to like you can't pick a bad one, it's just a beetle.

Keza
01:08:27
Yep, pretty much. They're different colours and sizes, but they're just beetles.

Matthew
01:08:31
They're just beetles.

Keza
01:08:32
Um I have two left. I'm gonna create some suspense and leave the most unexpected one to last. Uh so the next One is Nez Remix.

Samuel
01:08:42
Oh nice.

Keza
01:08:43
I think that it is a really cool way to experience old ass video games in like 15-second chunks that kind of show you their best idea. And the format of Nez Remix is that obviously you're you're playing bits of these old games and they're they're mixed up together. And it's actually a really good crash course on like Nintendo Entertainment System era games in history. And you're only getting the kind of core idea of the games. Um but then you're also getting what made them like compelling at the time because they are very, very addictive, like trying to do trying to do your trying to uh get a faster time on NES remix was something I got consumed by and me and my partner were competing on it for for weeks. Um and I think it really helped me understand the appeal of NES games because NES was before my time. I I got SNES, that was my first console, and so uh it really helped me to kinda understand why people loved things like Excite Bike and you know, the balloon one, balloon fight and things like that. It helped me to get it. So I found it very educational and I also just think it's a banger. It's really fun to play.

Matthew
01:09:41
Yeah. I I think it's the for me it's the piece of the puzzle. It's like missing from something like the um Atari collection, for example. You know, like something just to like curate it a little bit more. Cause they did a similar thing in rare replay. I think you know, whether they they, you know, took inspiration from this remix, I don't know, but like the idea of boiling a game down to like one mechanic or two mechanics and testing you at it I really loved it. It was that's a that's a great pick.

Keza
01:10:09
And then the last one the last one, right? Bear with me. Clubhouse games. Fifty one classics from around the world.

Samuel
01:10:16
Oh, interesting. I would not have predicted that.

Keza
01:10:19
Okay. The reason that this game is super underrated is because it's secretly a guide to the pre-video game history of Nintendo. Mm-hmm. 'Cause it includ you know Nintendo obviously was a Hanafuda company originally and then a playing card company like Western style playing cards and then a board game and everything else you can think of Company. It turns out in Clubhouse Games, all of that's in there. They have toy versions of like air hockey, baseball, toy curling, toy tennis. They have Nez Golf in there. And then they have, you know, every single card game ever known to man, obviously, and a bunch of classic board games like Ludo and all of the uh kind of world variants on chess and stuff. So not only is it just f I mean, you know, screw you UFO fifty, this is fifty-one games. Um not only are there lots of like just you know classic board and card games in there, but it's it's a really interesting compilation of like all the stuff that Nintendo made as analog games back in the day. There's this book called Before Mario, which is by a guy called Eric Voskill and it's like a photo catalogue of Nintendo's toys that they made. Um throughout history, like gun things and stuff like that. And I I I bought that when I was researching the book and you know, I was sort of browsing through it and then as I was browsing through it I was like, hang on, I recognise all this from Clubhouse Games and I went back and played it and was like, this it genuinely I think it's uh it's a little private trick.

Samuel
01:11:36
Finally, someone talked about a game my dad likes on this podcast. It has to happen eventually. So um great. That's great. Yeah, well I don't think we ever talked about that on this podcast. So that's um I I I like that as a connecting back Nintendo's history. That's I never really thought of it that way.

Keza
01:11:51
That's that's really cool. Neither did I until I made this realisation whilst reading that before Mario book and playing it at the same time. It's it's it's yeah, it's fascinating.

Matthew
01:11:59
They should do an amiibo of like a dice or Or checker. When's the Barbara batter amiibo? That's that's what I'm really thinking about.

Keza
01:12:08
Yes, I mean I'm sure Jam with the Band is due a comeback. It's been a it's been a long while.

Samuel
01:12:11
Well, thank you so much for compiling those, uh Keza. That's um that's an awesome way to end the episode. episode and um thank you so much for coming on and uh also thank you to for the the guardian support of this podcast. Um it's greatly appreciated.
