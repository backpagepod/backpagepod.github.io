Hello, and welcome to The Back Page, a video games podcast. I'm Samuel Roberts, and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle.
Hello.
Matthew, how are you doing this week? This is the only episode we're making this month. There's not a massive pain in the ass because we've got different guests coming on.
So let's enjoy this moment of respite. How are things going?
Yeah, good. I've seen A Bond, which I liked, so I'm quite happy.
That's good. That might date this episode a little bit, but that's fine. People will still be watching No Time To Die, three, four years from now, when they discover this podcast.
Oh, yeah. After the end of The Human Race, but the Apple Podcast page is still up. People are still listening to The Back Page to hear about magazines from the late noughties.
So, yes. Yeah, I've not seen it yet, but I will see it. I'm basically weighing up.
Do I go and see it in a cinema where posh people might give me coronavirus or where scuzzy students might give me coronavirus? Those are my two choices at stand, so weighing that up in this newfangled world we live in. Where would you rank it next to the other Craig Bond films?
I'd say probably alongside Casino Royale and Skyfall.
Okay, right, interesting.
They're not my all-time favourite Bonds, but they're much better than Spectre.
Right, yeah, well, that was a piece of shit. So, yeah. Indulge me in this preamble, then, Matthew.
What are your all-time favourite Bond films?
GoldenEye, and I also like the big silly one, like Spy Loved Me.
I like the Spy Loved Me, and I was looking at a bunch of lists this week, right, and people had it on the worst. I saw two lists that had it as Roger Moore's worst Bond film, and I thought, well, that is provably not true. Moonraker's definitely worse.
But also, that's a fun film, right? That's like the campy action done well, I think.
Maybe I'm just bringing that with me from childhood, but I like all that stuff.
Maybe Sheriff John W. Pepper will make an appearance in Games Court this week, Matthew.
Oh, God, I hope not.
Okay, so yes, that's the preamble done with, so when people can't complain, we just spend the podcast talking about bullshit, but I hope you enjoyed the casual chatter there. But this episode, we promised a little while ago on Twitter, but we're going to be doing a listener edition of our Bad eBay Games Court episodes, which are probably our most self-indulgent format, where I basically read out a bunch of games that I bought. Matthew decided whether they were bullshit or not and whether I should be sentenced to death.
I think the first one captured people's imaginations, but the second one people really got into. So, I think now the idea that we can put our own listeners on trial is fun, Matthew. How are you feeling about that as the judge at the centre of this?
Quite excited, because with you, there's a lot of games, so the outcome is quite murky. Here, a lot of their fates balance on a single game, so the drama of the court, which is obviously what the judge lives for, is way more heightened. I'm pretty certain, like, we're going to see some deaths today, which, you know, some people are going to like that.
You've got a bit of, like, sort of a BBC football comment, like, pundit vibes to that. I think we're going to see some deaths today. I'm quite looking forward to it.
Oh, I'd love a match of the day for, like, trials.
Yeah.
Listen, there's a very good chance, I think we're going to see a man die today.
Yeah, I think that's also potential to turn into a bloodbath, unless the court-appointed public defender can do something to help. So, let's just go straight into it, Matthew. We're putting our listeners on trial.
We're back in Matthew Castle's court. I don't know where this court is located. There's a lot to be excited about here.
So I, a previous defendant, have been appointed on behalf of The Back Page's listeners to defend them. A Jimmy McGill-style figure, a Sol Goodman-style, you know, cut price, turns up in a shit car, in a cheap suit, lawyer. I'm here to help our listeners to stop them from being executed by this ruthless judge.
So as the judge, Matthew, what is the threat of death this time? And who's in the courtroom, which always defines what these are in the past. We've had, you know, the tumbling monkeys from Rhythm Heaven.
We've had Wario. We've had a Tetris block. We've had a poorly rendered alien queen and Ripley, Ellen Ripley.
You know, I think like a poorly rendered Chewbacca as well. Some Pikmin in a coat. It's really just like.
Who's who?
It's basically like Harvey Birdman, but as like a podcast. So who's in the court this time, Matthew?
So Wario is back. But, oh wait, hang on. I'm looking at him.
No, this is Wario in quote marks. This is Wario from the upcoming Super Mario Brothers film. And so it's Wario in quote marks and he's voiced by Dustin Hoffman.
That's weird.
Yeah, I mean, I don't know what happened to the real Wario in this situation. I thought he lived on this island, wherever this courtroom is.
Maybe the real Wario will turn up too. I don't know how different Wario in quote marks is, but he's, I guess we'll find out.
Would you like to do an impression of Dustin Hoffman's Wario for the podcast, Matthew?
Eh, I'm Wario.
That's actually not too bad.
Right?
Yeah, that's all right. I mean, it's almost as if you've been practicing before we recorded.
I honestly haven't. I didn't predict that coming up. Technically, Wario in quote marks should be voiced by Chris Pratt too.
Yeah, you'd think so, right?
How cursed can one film be? We've got to draw a line somewhere.
Yeah, I felt like, oh, I can't be bothered to talk about Chris Pratt. So yeah, let's move on to who else is in the courtroom, Matthew.
We've got Sissel, who's the ghostly protagonist from Ghost Trick. He's here and he's possessed a washing machine. That's a bit odd.
That is strange.
I mean, see, he's rumbling away in the background.
It's almost like he went, I know I can't get Shoe Takumi in this courtroom, so what's the closest equivalent I can get?
What, and the best I could come up with was a washing machine.
Well, yeah, from one of his games, yeah.
We've got Alan Wake. He's here, but I'm a bit worried that he's just trying to promote his remaster, which comes out.
Yeah, is he gonna be monologuing during the hearings? Will that be a problem? I mean, I don't know.
Yeah, I secretly hoped the next person would be put to death, but I pretended that I was here for justice.
Yeah, I wrote it down in my book, and before I knew it, the person was dead. Yeah, so that's good.
Poorly rendered Chewbacca's back.
Master Terrace Carsey.
We've also got a very poorly rendered Indiana Jones from the N64 infernal machine.
Oh, okay, right. We should address the results of the N64 draft, shouldn't we? Let's go through who else is in the court, and then we'll do that.
Let's do that at the end.
That's who I've got on my list at the moment, but you know, some other people may turn up.
Yeah, okay, yeah. So you won the vote, Matthew, for the N64 draft in a stunning blow against my terrible tactics for beating you. So how are you feeling about that result?
Yeah, okay. I don't know if it was actually a victory for my games or if it was just like a victory for decency.
I think that very much seemed to be, people were voting against the very idea of me, I think. Which, you know, I guess I can't get too mad about. There were several aspects to it that I found a bit frustrating.
One was that people really do just pick one or two games they like and not the entire list and vote based on that. And like, I tweeted one listener who said that, oh, I think Infernal Machines are better picked than Rogue Squad, you know what I'm saying? And it's like, it took everything in my being not to go, what the fuck are you talking about?
And like, just kind of rein it in. And I think like, I sort of constantly had that frustration throughout. And again, underestimated just how much people like Majora's Mask, you know.
And also I think I underestimated Super Smash Bros. as a pick. And I think that once I did the perfect Dark Golden, I think to you, I felt like I couldn't call any of your picks bad because I felt so bad about doing that.
Even though I was certain that Infernal Machine was a duff pick, but I kind of let you sell it as like a hidden gem.
My favorite bit of Twitter interaction this last week, and I can't remember what the person said. You replied quite techily with, oh, big Infernal Machine guy, eh? And that's where I was like, that's the true Samuel coming through in that tweet.
Yeah, that's the real petty me. So it was 51.9% to 48.1%. We had 459 votes.
That's a massive, like, that's like 50% more than we had for the PS2 one. So I really appreciate people interacting with it.
That'd be a Brexit split, you know? People could argue about that for years to come.
Yeah, I'd say, the thing is, I do think I have the better list just ever so slightly. I think your list actually does look better on paper than it maybe seemed in that podcast, but it's a bit like the, but it's a bit like the sort of the Kennedy-Nixon election where, like, people who watched it on TV said that Kennedy won and people who listened to it on the radio said that Nixon won. It's like that, you know?
It's like written down. Written down, the result maybe reads differently. So, yeah.
Interesting. But honestly, so flattering to have so many people engage with it, just like, people just really got into it. And so, yeah, we have another draft coming next month, Matthew, that's the GameCube versus Xbox draft.
The actual mechanics of it, we haven't entirely figured out. I've got some ideas. I'm a bit wary of burning through two excellent consoles in a single podcast because those consoles are definitely worth their own podcasts.
But we can litigate that off air and figure it out. So, yes, thank you very much for voting on that and we'll have more drafts soon. Me and Matthew have talked about doing a PS Vita draft for next year when that console turns 10 years old.
And also, I think we're gonna do a Wii one as well in 2022. So people have those to look forward to. We'll just keep doing them till we run out of consoles we know about.
Yeah, basically.
Yeah, people were asking for a Dreamcast one, Matthew, but we're not quite qualified for that, are we?
Oh, I just don't have the knowledge. It would be like totally bogus.
Yeah, it would just be picking games that have a reputation that I know about, you know, or like there's about five games, you know, like Crazy Taxi or Shenmue II I've played, but I would like struggle beyond the very obvious ones. So, yeah. But back to games court then, Matthew.
As I say, I'm the public defender who's been appointed to defend our listeners. And I've prepared an opening statement, if you'll allow me to read it.
I haven't told you how people are gonna die.
Oh yeah, that is more important. Let's go with that first.
Because it's good to know what you're defending people against. Basically, if you're found guilty, you get dunked into that big box of water from the film, The Prestige. And they close the lid on it and Michael Caine sort of looks at you sadly while you're drunk.
Okay, I really love that.
Because then we end up with loads of boxes full of dead listeners. Is it like, We need to keep them somewhere, I don't know where.
Is it like the bit where Piper Perabo dies in that film where like Michael Caine's just smashing it with an axe, trying to get them out in front of an audience. And that happens every single time.
Yeah, I don't know if he'd try and smash every box because after one or two boxes, he'd probably realize he can't do it in time. So he'd probably just give up and sort of sit on a chair looking really sad. So I don't know.
I guess we'll see like how many people get put in a box because maybe he might not like, he might free the first person in a box. But he's definitely gonna weigh not around, I don't know, person four.
Yeah, we have, I think we have 16 different.
Oh yeah, there's no way Michael Caine is liberating all those people from a box of water.
So, okay, good. That is a very inventive way of people dying. I would say that for the court, if that happens 16 times in a row, that will be quite harrowing to watch 16 young men die in water.
Warying on quote marks, you'll love it.
Yeah, exactly. Okay, good. All right then, so my opening statement.
I'm just gonna like look around. I've got my suit on. I'm like, you know, messing with my tie a little bit.
I stand up.
Is this what you're doing or what you're saying?
No, this isn't the statement. It's not started yet.
You've got a bit Alan Wake on me.
Yeah, it's not started yet, sorry. All right, so. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, Judge Matthew Castle is out for blood.
The clients I represent today are all charged with making foolish purchases. And I, a man previously put on trial for this crime and held captive in this Colonel Kurt-style island compound, I'm here to tell you that they are innocent, maybe. I ask you, how can you trust the judgment of a man who thinks playing the Phoenix Wright games is a substitute for a law degree?
How can you trust a man who let tumbling monkeys and the alien queen into his courtroom? And how can you trust a man who introduced a feature called Barrel Watch during official Xbox magazine's redesign in 2016, a feature that only talked about barrels in computer games? To this man, the law is just something he scribbled down during a tough deadline as a meatball fell out of his Maranara sub.
These people deserve to make comforting, terrible games purchasers during these end times for capitalism and the human race at large. And I'm here to ensure that the fatality rate of my clients remains below 40%. Thank you.
Wow. I didn't realise this episode was written by Aaron Sorkin.
That's very flattering and insulting at the same time. So well done there. That's good.
I would also say that any defence attorney whose tactic is to smear the judge rather than protect the client. That's quite a wild tactic.
Yeah, it is a little bit.
Like I'm gonna make you, instead of, I'm not gonna make you believe in my client. I'm gonna make you question the law.
I think it's just because this is obviously as identified by one of our lists. This is a kangaroo court and it's, you know, the regular law does not apply from any kind of civilized countries. This is like, you know, like your Colonel Kurtz style sort of island nation where what you say goes.
And, you know, I don't know how you got Michael Caine here. I've got a lot of questions about that, I'll be honest. But, you know, hey, I guess maybe it doesn't have loads going on.
He came with the boxes.
Okay, yeah. So, yeah, those, I did also wonder, is it getting a bit personal when I mention A, Barrel Watch and B, a meatball falling out of a marinara sub felt weirdly personal in a way I can't really describe.
I mean, that presents me as, like, some kind of oafish eater, which I'm not.
No, you're fairly elegant, I've seen it, you know.
Yeah, I mean, that's, like, I don't end every meal, I don't need a bib, you know.
Yeah, if you've ever seen, like, Matthew, like, eat a little cake, it's art, you know. You're basically watching art happen. He's very, very elegant.
So, let's get straight to the defendants, then, Matthew. First of all, we've got quite a lot here from, we're gonna do them one by one, so they can present their own exhibits and we'll fire through them and then Matthew will decide whether Michael Cable watched them drown or not and then we can enjoy that. So, James Morgan is first up.
Evening, lads. Evening seems like a bizarre thing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, your honor, please.
So, I definitely fell into a hole of eBay and CEX collecting during lockdown. I absolutely cannot defend most of these, but I can at least try and offer insight into my thinking at the time. This has been a mere sprinkling of some of the tosh I've bought in the last 18 months or so.
Oh God, this guy's gonna die so much. Okay, so. Honestly, it's like it's a disaster, but that's not him saying that.
This is me. Sometimes you've got to write off the ones so you know you can't save. So, World Snooker Championship Reel 09.
Imagine if you heard your defensor dirty say that under his breath. Like, this guy's gonna die so much.
I mean, don't worry about it. It gives him a thumbs up. Yeah.
Okay, so, yeah, World Snooker Championship Reel 09 on PS3 for £4.35. I've been playing a lot of the poor minigame in Yakuza Zero and it reminded me how much I'd loved playing snooker games on PS1 slash 2. Haven't played this yet, for fuck's sake.
Again, that's me, the defendant. The Sopranos Road to Respect, PS2, £6.95. I love this show.
The game is absolutely abject, yep. The Testament of Sherlock Holmes on PS3, £11.95. This isn't quite as bad.
I really enjoyed Crimes and Punishment, as recommended by Andy Kelly on your podcast, so I ended up buying all the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games, but they're all much worse in Crimes and Punishment.
That's right, that's correct.
Which I think we even said on that podcast, didn't we? The Best Detective Games one? That was a great episode, we should try and get Andy back on.
But Alpha Protocol, PS3, £3. I do love games that you can describe as interesting failures. This is the platonic ideal of an interesting failure.
Amazing concept, basically unplayable. I feel like we've probably disappointed a lot of the Alpha Protocol stands out there, Matthew, on this podcast. We've shown not much love for it.
This feels like a podcast that should like Alpha Protocol. But simply cannot.
Yeah, that basically sums it up. Amazing, tough time for Obsidian. Okay, seven Premiere Manager games.
I summed these up, Matthew. They're all about three pounds each. I got this weird idea in my head.
I needed all of the Premiere Manager games on PS2. Upon the menu screen of the first one loading up, I was immediately hit with a powerful memory of just how awful the series became. Upon the transition to PS2.
Also, how annoying is it how they couldn't stick to one way of referring to the years in the titles? Yeah, you need to see them written down for that, but I assure you that his observation is astute. Final one here, Matthew.
John Wu presents Stranglehold PS3 £3.75. What if a game was just a max pain slow down time mechanic, but not as high quality? So, as I say, I think this guy is doomed.
The seven Premiere Manager games ensure that James Morgan probably needs to be executed and I'm prepared to move on to my next client in order to defend them, but what does the judge think?
I like Stranglehold, you went against the wisdom of this podcast and you bought a Sherlock Holmes games that we told you was going to be bad. Sopranos, I mean, listen, let's get this guy in a box.
Would you not even allow Sopranos as a kind of curiosity purchase, Matthew?
No, no, let's get him in the box.
Okay, Michael Caine is currently sadly watching James Morgan die.
Someone give Michael Caine a hanky.
Okay, so that's one client dead, good. I think that Stranglehold is totally the sort of thing I would have bought on GameScore, actually. So that one I do understand.
If it was just Stranglehold, he would be alive right now.
There is something weirdly cursed about buying Alpha Protocol on PS3 as well, which I can't describe. It's the combination of Alpha Protocol and PS3. That's like-
PS3 is the Alpha Protocol of consoles.
Yeah, it kind of is.
That is how it's decreed on Castle Island.
Oh, we have a name for this nation, do we?
Well, that's what I call it, affectionately.
Well, the main character in Alpha Protocol just stormed out of the courtroom, but no one noticed because he looked so generic that he could have been anyone. So, yeah.
Also, he glitched through the floor halfway there.
Okay, defendant number two is Chris Doherty. Fingers crossed he'll come out of this alive, Chris.
So, this isn't a recent purchase, but I bought Mortal Kombat for the Amiga for the pricely sum of 15 quid many moons ago. I don't own an Amiga. I have never owned an Amiga and apparently this version is pretty shit, but not as shit as the Master System or Game Boy versions.
It actually says Gam Boy, but we'll go with Game Boy. So why did I buy it? It was in fairly good condition and it had that sweet MK Dragon stencil set included.
Please see Exhibit A of the stencil set included with the game. Pretty cool, right? Have mercy, Your Honour.
So I sent you a picture of this, Matthew. I do think the stencil set is pretty cool. I don't know if it's worth 15 pounds personally.
I don't know why I'm saying this as an offence.
So you basically pay 15 quid for the privilege of being able to stencil the Mortal Kombat dragon head on basically anything you want. Really, that's what you've put on the line here. You're above a trap door, there's a big tank of water under you, and that's what you're saying.
That's the case you're making, that stenciling is cool. I'm not going to go into why. I hate stencils.
Were you wronged by a stencil once?
I just find it very boring. It's not a childhood activity I look back fondly on.
Okay. Yeah. Did a bully stencil something onto you, Matthew?
Did someone stencil the Mortal Kombat logo onto you as a small child?
All over my face. It also explains who has been stenciling Mortal Kombat dragons all over Castle Island. Finally, we can put that to rest.
I'm afraid it's in the tank you go.
Shit, that's too dead. Fuck. That's rough.
I'm going to go outside for a cigarette.
I don't understand buying games for machines you don't have.
I don't think I've ever done that.
That's baffling to me. I just don't believe in buying the game for the sake of having the game. It has to be playable.
If anyone else has bought it and doesn't have the console, they are dying, no matter what the game.
I don't think that happens again, but I can't say for sure. Well, there you go, no pardoning for stencilling then. Chris Doherty is dead, Michael Caine again watching.
Someone fetched Michael Caine a cup of tea. He's having a tough one already.
It would be quite an artistic shot because you've got the body and then those stencils are kind of floating around him.
Yeah, very evocative. Oh, wow. Yeah, I see.
Maybe you could be the next Christopher Nolan Matthew with that kind of artistic eye. Big Roger Deakins energy there. Okay, so third defendant is Simon Thompson.
Your Honor, Exhibit A, I write to you today to submit two pieces of evidence for your judgment. Back in 2007, I was 17 and went mad with power after getting a PayPal account. I bought a Metal Gear Solid Foxhound branded Zippo lighter posted direct from Hong Kong for the princely sum of £7 plus £3 postage and packaging.
Around that time, I was obsessed with MGS3 and eagerly awaiting MGS4. I thought it would supplement the Foxhound fabric patch I also bought and had sewn onto my hoodie to make people think I was cool. Not knowing how Zippos work, or indeed people, I didn't appreciate that I needed to buy lighter fluid, which meant after the three week delivery time, I had to wait another full week for that to arrive.
I don't smoke and so have never used it. It's currently encased in the display cabinet, along with all the other crap I am too sentimental to let go of. The hoodie also gets brought out for festivals.
I've sent Matthew photos of these things. You don't need to see them. It's a picture of a lighter and it's a patch on a jacket.
It's fine. But I appreciate the illustration, Simon. So Exhibit B.
I had never pre-ordered a game before, but in November 2020 bought a physical copy of a digital download of Cyberpunk 2077 using a 20% off voucher, thinking that getting a £50 game for £37.56 would be the deal of the century and fill the void of a Christmas and lockdown. It has since sat on my shelf undownloaded while I wait for CD Projekt Red to finally finish patching it. It's currently £33.39 on GOG.
In the end, I filled the void with cheese instead. On this podcast, that's what we often do, so you know, that might work in your favour. The included goodies are still cool though.
Matthew, Simon there is putting some merch on display. I would say that the lighter must be fake because it's so cheap. And official Konami merchandise.
I don't feel like they would make a Metal Gear Solid lighter, an official one. So, that's like bootleg goods, which itself is an illegal act. But what do you make of buying Cyberpunk at a discount at launch, combined with the merch?
Did you see which platform it was?
PC.
On PC, I thought it was sort of fine at launch, you know, it was a bit busted, but I played it perfectly fine. Buying games at launch for cheap, can you really punish that?
I mean, I also bought Cyberpunk, so I feel like I can't judge that much, you know.
I don't think buying Cyberpunk on PC is a killing offence. Buying it for cheap is just sensible. You know what, I don't really have a problem with the bootleg lighter either.
I wouldn't use it myself, and I don't think I would stitch that patch onto my clothes. But I don't know if I'd stitch any patch onto my clothes. And it's quite a cool bit of iconography.
Maybe a talking point. Someone's like, were you in the army? And you say no, I like metal gear, and then that's a friendship right there.
That's how our friendship started, I believe.
That is exactly our origin story. Yeah, I think you're not guilty.
Okay, there you go. That's two dead, one still alive. Michael Caine gets a little break there, puts his axe down.
That's fine. So, yeah, Simon, you're still alive. I think that buying Cyberpunk was fine as well.
I too wait for the day where it's kind of in perfect shape. But I don't know, for the four or five hours I played of it, I enjoyed the spectacle of it. But I can see it being a good game one day, if not necessarily a great game.
So, yeah, cool.
If you bought it pre-owned on, like, Xbox One, then obviously you deserve everything you get.
Good, good. But you're still alive, Simon. So don't worry.
That's fine.
So that's fine.
Yeah. Simon also suggests a podcast idea that we do, Desert Islanders, for game soundtracks, Matthew. I don't feel like I've got loads that I can articulate about games music, so I'm not necessarily sure.
I'm not very good at talking about music. I love it.
Yeah, that's why you get those kind of, like, reviews on music sites that just use such preposterous adjectives.
It's like, oh, it's a hit of licorice excitement. I'm like, what the fuck does that mean? Are they playing a trumpet?
Just tell me.
Oh, OK. Good. So fourth defendant is Liam Richardson.
He is the meme king. He has created memes for our podcast and is, generally speaking, a very nice boy, but has posted cursed images of himself posed with Sonic the Hedgehog on Twitter, which gave me pause about continuing to follow him.
As you tell that, I'm beginning to hear a chant from the court very quietly in the background, give him the tank. Give him the tank.
Yeah.
The court has already made its mind up. Let's hear his case.
Morning both. Again, morning. I don't really know where that comes from.
I mean, you know.
I mean, it's the morning.
Well, there is no, but there is no time on Castle Island.
I think not that I abolish time. That was one of my weirder decrees.
Against my better judgment, I'm here to throw myself at the mercy of Judge Castle. Much like Sam, I've spent the majority of lockdown spending obscene amounts of money on copies of old games. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't say obscene. I was like, you know, I was just going through some stuff.
I mean, technically we've decided we've this court has decided it wasn't obscene.
Yeah. And hence, wow, I can now be your public defendant, Liam, in this island beyond the concept of time itself. So yeah, I've seen amounts of money on copies of old games I don't need in an effort to feel something.
I think I just like it when the doorbell rings. I had a lot to choose from, but I've settled on the following. On the 14th of August, I bought a copy of Beautiful Joe and the Gamecube for $17.99.
Seems fine, right? A good purchase. Old Liam lives to see another day.
Thing is, it's the Japanese version. I don't have a Japanese Gamecube. I have no intention of buying a Japanese Gamecube.
I cannot physically play this game. I bought it to look at it. I just like knowing it's on my shelf.
I have brain worms. I also picked up a Japanese copy of Fresny We'll Remake at the same time, but that's a different story. Bonus entry.
It sounds like the same story to me, and they both have the same very unhappy ending.
Bonus entry. After an early episode of the pod, I rushed onto eBay to pick up a copy of Zack and Wiki on Wii. I got a great deal, 99p, but was devastated to realise when it arrived that it was a US copy of the game, so I can't play that either.
This probably won't come as a surprise, but I love the podcast and I'm really happy to see it grow week on week. I think you've both offered some respite to a lot of people this year. Keep it up.
Thanks, Liam.
That's nice. That's such a sweet sentiment, which makes it so very difficult for me, and so very sad for me that I am going to have to drown you, I'm afraid. Because I have explained already that buying something that you cannot play is dumb in game court.
Can I, as Liam's defense attorney, suggest that he go and buy one of those region-free GameCube thingies? Because that would allow him to play Viewtful Joe on any GameCube that he has, unless he's playing on Wii, actually, that might not work. But if he's got a GameCube, then he could play Viewtful Joe using one of those.
I think you can get them on eBay for fairly cheap.
So, you're saying if he basically pledges to turn his life around?
Yeah, exactly. You know, like, we're sort of, you know, this is what Saul Goodman does, isn't it? He's like, no, Your Honor, don't put them to death.
How about you give them four months of, you know, probation or whatever, and then picking up litter by the road.
Interesting. Interesting. So we're saying probation for Liam Richardson to get an import GameCube so that his crime is negated.
You know what? I'm in a, well, I say I'm in a generous mood. I mean, I've already killed like two dudes today.
Yeah, I'll accept.
Okay, that's good. He was being lowered into the tank.
And I mean this for real. If you don't buy one of those things and post proof of it on Twitter, we're going to revisit this and kill you in six months.
Yep. So I can't remember what they're called, but yeah, you can get them. They're like, they were made by one of those like mad cat style companies.
You can put it into a UK GameCube and it will let you play Japanese games. So if you do that, Liam, you will be spared again. Few.
So that's kind of, that's, that's two. I've kind of won Matthew versus, yeah, versus two.
And that was, if I'm, that was some good lawyering. I like that.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I mean, I thought it was about time I did some lawyering as their lawyer.
Yeah. Yeah.
I thought it was very generous of me.
As we say that we hear a big sigh of relief from under the courtroom from Michael Caine.
Oh, it's all going on beneath, is it?
Well, yeah, because they get dunked underneath, it's like the stage in The Prestige. We don't see Michael Caine. He's just down there.
Oh, right. Yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah.
Every time I press the button, they disappear through the floor. We hear a bit of glugging and then we hear a man go, oh, no.
Yeah, I know.
But this time he was like, oh, phew.
At the risk of this podcast turning into like a gaming version of The Trip, which is very, very possible given who we are, let's move on to the fifth defendant, who is Danny Mann. That's a great name. So not that that will score any points to the judge, but I thought I'd point it out.
Actually, it does score points with me.
Okay. Yeah. Wow.
This place really doesn't obey any sort of rules. So hi, Back Page Pod. I stand before you today in court with the charge of not of a bad decision, but of impatience.
My eBay purchase isn't actually bad at all. Red alert to Yuri's Revenge on PC. However, my real crime is actually one of impatience.
I'd purchased the game on eBay originally. This is back in the days before I had PayPal. So after winning the eBay auction, my mum, I was only about 10 at the time, had to send off a check to the seller, wait for it to arrive to them and then clear and then wait for them to post the game and it to arrive.
All in all, this whole process could take some two to four weeks. About one week after sending the check, I happened to be in my local game store in Faram. I think Samuel may know it.
Yep, I literally bought Star Wars Battle for Naboo in that game in Faram. When I saw it on sale for about £20, brand new, even though £20 was a lot for a 10-year-old me back then, my impatience got the better of me and I bought it again, even knowing full well if I just waited another week or so, I'd be receiving another copy in the post. I'm not sure if impatience is something you can send someone to their death for, but I leave it up to the Honourable Judge Castle to decide, yours impatiently, Danny Mann.
What I will say, Matthew, is that you put me to death for buying a game. Well, no, you didn't put me to death, but you counted it against me when I bought Zone of the Enders 2, a game I already owned on another console, so buying the same game twice historically doesn't go down well with this, Judge. Where are you at with it?
Yeah, I mean, I must admit I don't have any particular relationship with the individual game.
Oh, Yuri's Revenge is so good. That's like peak Command and Conquer, Red Alert 2, and that expansion was rad, so it was a good purchase.
Yeah, my relationship with Command and Conquer begins and ends with Red Alert 1. To answer your question, yes, impatience is a crime on Castle Island. As Sam said, I don't look kindly on double purchasing.
I mean, if anything, you disrespected the effort that your mum went through writing that cheque. And I think we got ourselves a drowning.
Okay, sorry about that, Danny, but Yuri's Revenge.
That was from the floor.
It sounds a bit more like, is it Kenneth Williams in Carry On?
It's muffled by the wood.
Oh, that's why it's a bit distorted, is it?
That's how it sounds up here. Who knows how it sounds in the room?
It's not going bloody hell. It might not be doing that instead.
Oh, not again.
Okay, well, inexplicably, Christian Bale has ran into the courtroom shouting, and cheers, and yeah, and so we had to take a brief recess there. We'll come back now. So number six, Matthew, is Tana Hoisington.
I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. Dear Honorable Judges, I had thought I would have nothing to present to the court as my odd game purchases have only been my triple order of Little King Story, Super Paper Mario and Zack and Wiki a few months back. However, yesterday I walked into GameStop to pick up Deathloop and like a fool bought NBA 2K21 for PS5 for 20 bucks new.
I did this a week after this year's game came out and broke a 6 year boycott of the series because their microtransactions are straight garbage, knowing that the rosters and stats will be outdated. Why did I do this? Because I'm a fan of one of the smaller teams, the New Orleans Pelicans, and it had our young star Zion as a cover athlete.
This is a very American question, Matthew. I just need a couple more days to get my will in order before I face the games court chair. Well, it's not a chair, I'm afraid, it's a tank.
So Matthew, NBA 2K21, god, basketball. Do we have an opinion on sports on this podcast? Not really.
I thought those games, dodgy microtransactions and in-game adverts and all that stuff aside, were meant to be pretty amazing, right? They look amazing.
They really do. And that PS5 version as well, that looked incredible, if I recall.
I mean, a PS5 game for $20?
Yeah, that is good.
I mean, that's kind of a find, I think, because PS5 games are the most overpriced games on the planet. You've got a sentimental attachment to this, you're going to play it. You also mentioned that you bought some genuinely good games in the past on the Wii.
Yeah, I think I'm going to let this go, you know.
Okay, good. What has Michael Cain said downstairs, Matthew?
Oh, Aspaw like it.
It's the floorboards.
Oh, thank God. There you go.
He's still in a room surrounded with the bodies of men floating eerily in tanks.
Yeah, but he's used to that, isn't that basically the whole deal with the Hugh Jackman character in The Prestige? Although he's not really involved in that, is he?
No, he's not. He would be disgusted by it.
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, okay, good stuff.
I'm actually really muddling up how The Prestige works.
Yeah, I also feel like we're infringing on Joe's territory with the Spicy Prestige memes a little bit, just because that's such a good Instagram account. I very much recommend following that. There's some very good deep dive Prestige jokes in that, but let's face it, it's just a funny film, isn't it?
Yeah, okay, good. So Sean Mitcherson is defendant number seven. Hey guys, I recently picked up a Nintendo Wii, having sold mine many years ago.
I decided that I should pick up one again, under the assumption that there will be a resurgence in the desire to experience motion controls again in around 20 years' time and the price of a Wii will skyrocket. Anyway, one of the first games I picked up for the console was Let's Tap, complete with original boxes. I paid the very reasonable price of £9.50 for it, which I thought was pretty good, but I guess the bad eBay Games court will decide.
Love the podcast. That's from Sean. So Matthew, this feels like an easy result to me.
You know, it's nice to have a defendant who's less likely to be executed in the tank, but where are you at with it?
Yeah, I mean, I love Let's Tap. I've recommended it on this podcast before. I mean, with the original boxes, that's quite a niche, interesting purchase.
Yeah, I couldn't possibly send this to the tank.
Okay, good.
Well, it's a great purchase. Let's Tap. I've played it, though.
I hope you play it. Don't just keep hold of it.
Otherwise, the box that Let's Tap came in will be filled with water and you'll be drowned in it.
Yeah.
While Michael Caine watches.
That box shall become your coffin.
Was that Michael Caine again? Was it?
No, that was just me being dramatic.
Okay, I thought that was Michael Caine. That box will become your coffin. There you go.
Oh, there you go. That's better.
Yeah, it's not bad, is it? Okay.
Alan Wake is nodding, impressed at your impression.
He didn't understand what I said because of the accent, but he thought it was good. From what he remembers of the Italian job, it's good. I think that's like four survivors, they're three deaths so far, Matthew.
Oh, this is not good.
Yeah, they're caught once more drama, basically.
Warying, quote marks, is getting antsy.
The door just flew open and a coat walked in and then fell over and then walked out again. I don't know what that was about, but yeah, so.
Unbelievable. How dare they try?
You're not a person.
I would slam my gavel in anger, but unfortunately it's been possessed by Sissel from Ghost Trick, so I can't use it anymore.
What happened to the washing machine? Has it just fell over?
It's just sitting there inanimate now, just confusing everyone.
Okay, yeah, what an inconvenience in the courtroom. Okay, so.
If you push the washing machine down the hatch that we drop the bodies down.
What happens then? What, the washing machine gets like, flooded? What will Michael Cain do?
It gets dumped in a tank and confuses Michael Cain, but it will wake him up. Keep him on his toes.
All right, good. The eighth defendant then, Ryan Cobain. Hello gents, hope all is well.
We've got loads here, Matthew.
If it's a long list, you read them out and if we hit an instant death verdict, I'll call instant death.
Oh, I think he's going to be pretty safe, to be honest. Let's see.
Okay, well, let's see.
Yeah. The Legend of Zelda Triforce Gold DS Lite for £135, that's a lot, but you know, whoa. Yeah, I mean, I think maybe that's a fancier one that is a bit rarer.
I don't know.
Yeah, that's fine.
Not dead. Good. That's an official stamp there, not dead.
The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass for £17.99, that seems about right with where prices are at on DS games. WarioWare Ink Touch £4.87 plus postage, that's pretty good.
Yeah.
I would still recommend just getting the gold edition on 3DS, but what can you do? But doesn't have a 3DS, as we've established, just a DS. So Metroid Prime Hunters on Nintendo DS £10.01.
I'm not a fan, but I'm not going to kill you over it.
Okay, oh, this is precarious. Pokémon White Edition £36. This court doesn't look kindly on Pokémon, but what do you think, Matthew?
I think that is actually quite a hard one to get hold of for cheap.
Listen, I'm not going to kill you over it, but if there's another Pokémon, you're in trouble.
So next up is Animal Crossing Wild World for £12.50. So I think that's almost a killable offence because Animal Crossing…
I think the Animal Crossing you buy should be the most recent one you can get. There's no reason to play an older one, I don't think, not even if you have nostalgia for it, because it literally is the same game but upgraded with new stuff. So I would say the judge should maybe consider that one as an offence, but Professor Layton in the Curious Village £7.97, that's safe with this.
That's classic.
Professor Layton, The Lost Future, same amount.
Oh, classic.
Spectre's Call £14.54.
What the hell is that?
No, that's another Professor Layton.
Oh, sorry, yeah, of course. I mean, that one's actually not very good. How much was that?
£14.54.
Okay, I'll let it go.
Alright, and Professor Layton, The Pandora's Box, £15.
I've never bought a DS.
I've never bought a DS. I've never bought a DS. I've never bought a DS.
I've never bought a DS.
I purchased a selection of games that I remembered owning or wanting to own as a child, hoping that the courts looked kindly on me.
So I don't know, Matthew, maybe that changes your verdict a little bit.
That Animal Crossing thing suddenly seems a lot worse.
Yeah, because you've got a 3DS.
Because you've confirmed that you do have the ability to play a better Animal Crossing.
The other games were pretty good purchases, though.
For me, the most exciting bit of the pre-owned game scene is you buy a new bit of hardware that you don't have and then you build a collection instantly. That's really exciting and it's quite hard to kill someone over that. One of my favourite times is when I got the PS2 Slim Mini, whatever the last version of the PS2 was, and building a PS2 collection in a pre-owned, I've quite a lot of nostalgia for that period.
So can I execute it over Animal Crossing? Seems a bit churlish.
I love the word churlish being the word you use there, related to executions.
I'll leave it to Wario to decide. Wario in quote marks, do you think we should let it go? Sorry.
Dustin Hoffman has decreed it so, into the tank.
Michael Gaines going, bloody hell. Okay right.
Bad impressions, Gamescoop.
These aren't even Games characters, I mean, I suppose Wario is technically, but that's like four apiece Matthew, so it's quite a lot of drama here.
That is a lot of DS games floating in that tank as well.
That is four dead young men.
If Michael Gaines got any sense, he'll fish them out because there's some good games in there. I love that. That's the tragedy of this particular death.
I mean, I love-
Is that most of them were good.
I love that the defendants have to carry the games they brought with them and then be drowned with them, symbolically. That's like a big part of the appeal for you, isn't it, is the paraphernalia floating around them as they die.
Yeah, absolutely.
Michael Cade just goes, Professor Layton in the lost future. I love this one. And then, yeah.
Okay, good.
Spectre's cool. Are you having a laugh?
Oh dear. What happened to this podcast? We had Simon Parkin on last week.
Maybe, like, I feel subconsciously like I really need to lower the tone after such a highbrow episode.
It was a little bit, wasn't it? I tried to lower it at the time by asking Simon, are you a big rich guy now? But yeah.
Time to drag this podcast through the mud some more. So, defendant number nine, Simon Gill. Hi gents.
Love the show. It's absolutely cracking. While I'd like to dispute Matthew's legal qualifications, I respect his authority on matters of poor eBay purchasing and taste.
Not so sure myself. I did make an eBay purchase. Driver One for PC last year.
A £6.80 buy. It was a nostalgic heart purchase. I never got to play it back in 1998 thanks to a game breaking bug and fondly remember it getting some good write ups at the time.
This time around I managed to get it working, but the first level was an absolute nightmare thanks to some terrible plot gubbins and awful controls. Gave it an hour or two, about the same time it took to get it working properly and sadly deleted it. Yep, that sounds like every PC gaming experience that I've ever had.
Keep up the good work, Simon. So Driver, Matthew. Very significant game at the time.
Very beautiful looking game on PS1 at the time. Very exciting. Very hard.
And a series that kind of had a lot of ups and downs over the years. Do you have much attachment to that series?
I, like many others, only really remember not being able to pass the driving test at the start that you had to do to play the game. One of the hardest tutorials of all time.
Yeah.
Simon, should I hold this against Simon? Should I hold the crimes of the driver tutorial team against Simon?
It's a weird purchase, but I was looking up and it's not on Steam and I don't think it's on GOG either.
I, no, I think, I think this is okay. I mean, I don't have a big attachment to the game. Lots of people do like it if they can get past that terrible tutorial.
You know, it's an interesting kind of artefact from the past and like you say, kind of hard to hold on to. And you did try to play it. You are saved from the tank.
There you go. OK, that's five still alive and four drowning with their DS and PS2 games.
Drowned. They are a bit drowned by now.
Yeah, sorry, they are. Yeah. What's the Michael Caine verdict on this one?
Jesus Christ, I think he's having a nap.
OK, fair enough. Yeah, that's good.
He's playing Professor Layton in the Lost Future, which is just fished out. He's playing it on that special edition Zelda DS.
Good for him, yeah. It was a bit waterlogged, but he used some rice to dry it out. That was good.
That's the thing, isn't it?
He's offering life hacks from beneath the stage.
Put a bit of rice in there and it will be dry in no time.
Thanks, Michael. Everyone in the court is nodding because they're like, oh, that's interesting.
I feel like all my voices are like GTA London 1969 voice acting. Yay be the monkey, I'll be the cheese grater. That's the only line I remember from that game.
So this is Kevin Boland. That's defendant number 10, Matthew. We're over halfway there.
My conscience weighs on me. I feel compelled to turn myself in. Please Back Page cast your judgment on my being.
I bought the GameKeeper Odyssey Battalion Wars for $29.16, apparently £21.22. I bear with me a sickness that desires boxes and manuals whenever possible, so I surely could have gotten the game for less, though I do have quite a nice box and manual now for the game. That said, it's a game I only rented as a child and was put off at that time by having to mix strategy with real-time unit control, which my feeble little brain couldn't comprehend.
Now I am much more adept and find the game to be in quite a unique niche. The Jeeps in particular are especially fun to control. Last summer I replayed Advance Wars 1 and 2, so this was the only logical next step.
Well, there's also the DS ones you could have played there, Kevin, but I'll let that go as you're returning. I am currently locked into both the digital and physical edition of the Advance Wars remakes later this year. I don't see why you need both.
That seems like a killable offence to me. Thanks for your guidance, Kevin. Matthew, these always struck me as kind of interesting games.
They got sort of all right reviews, the Battalion Wars ones. Weren't they made in the UK?
Yeah, made by Kuju, I believe.
What do you make of these? Did you ever play them?
Yeah, I played a bit of Battalion Wars 2 on the Wii. I don't like Battalion Wars. You're right, the mix of kind of strategy, but then you can also kind of do the on foot stuff.
Kind of sounds interesting, but none of it particularly lands for me. I'm not a big Advance Wars guy anyway, but I can appreciate the elegance of it. Battalion Wars always felt a bit clumsy, a bit messy to me.
I don't really know what its position is in like the wider kind of Nintendo community, but this is not a series that ever seems to come up on best of lists or whatever. A firmly and interesting 7 out of 10. So I am going to drop you in the tank.
Okay, so does that make us 5-5? I think it does. Yeah, I think it's 5-5.
So yeah, because of the Dustin Hoffman one. That's good. So Defender number 11 then, we're at 5-5.
So, you know, there's only six more. So it's crucial that we get this. We get some of these lads saved.
I promise the 40% fatality rate and I will deliver it. God damn it.
Picture yourself. You're going to court. You got to pick a lawyer.
You're looking at their websites. One of them promises a 40% fatality rate.
Well, you know, I think that's realistic in this island beyond space and time though, because, you know, the judge famously wants blood, like is paying for blood.
Are you arguing that in this island, 40% is actually, that's pretty good.
It's not bad. You know, it's like, it's not as bad as it sounds.
Well, you got to say like, I'm not a marketing guy, but word to the wise, I'd describe it as a 60% success rate.
That's more of a like a Sol Goodman approach to it, I think. Yeah. So, High Back Page Games Pod.
Super, it's not called that, but that's fine.
Tank.
Are you seriously going with that?
I'll hear him out, but listen, it better be fucking good.
Super short-term listener here, so excuse me if I'm going over previously trodden ground, but these are my submissions to Gamescore. Exhibit A. Epic Mickey Power of Illusion on the 3DS.
Purchased for £3.60. The last and least of Dream Rift. Short-lived, but excellent run of games for the DS and 3DS, following 2008's hidden gem Henry Hatsworth, where the team was under the EA banner, and 2011's sublime Monster Tale.
The platforming in this game is solid, with a fun but underutilised paint and thinner mechanic for manipulating the environment around you. The levels themselves are unfortunately pretty half-baked, with all but the final world being far too easy, although new routes through old levels to find hidden characters do add a bit of need of challenge. I think you could make it as a freelancer, Will, these are pretty good observations.
Exhibit B. If you survive, that is, I should say.
Don't offer him the carrot of feature employment.
Well, it'll give him hope as he's being drowned in the tank in front of Michael Caine, I think. And that's crucial. Exhibit B is Dylan's Dead Heat Breakers and the 3DS, purchased for £4.79.
Right, okay, so I know you probably bought that from Argos, because when I look at Argos 3DS games, that game is always fucking in there, and I've never once pulled the trigger on that, so I shouldn't really weigh in here, because I'm going for the 60% success rate thing, slash 40% fatality rate. I consider this a crime. By far, my favourite game in the Dylan's Rolling Western series.
The action of real-time battles meshes super well with some perfectly balanced tower defence. Your character in the field, Dylan the Armadillo, that sounds like a game that's like, you know, he's got a dime Matthew, is so much more precise with the button controls of this game than the stylus controls of past entries. And the addition of anemomals to man the turrets and control directly in a post-apocalyptic city is so fun.
Just a fantastic time for fans of both strategy and action, and it's still super cheap on eBay. Exhibit C appears too slim with two controllers, a memory card and power pack for £4 from an Age UK 2017. Enough said, fuck, that's a good purchase.
I rest my case, feel free to cut out as much or as little as my diatribe as you need for pacing. I wish I'd read that before I planned for this podcast, Matthew had read all that out. So where are you at with, I always call him Dylan, but that's the name of the game, I mean Will.
I think Dylan's the weak link here. I'm not a big fan of the whole Dylan's Rolling Western thing. It really, really leaves me cold.
It's like a super weird bit of Nintendo. I think it's developed externally. I want to say Vanpool.
I don't know. The PlayStation just feels like such a good purchase.
It really does, yeah. It's tough to go against that.
Yeah, I think that's too good a purchase. I mean that Mickey game, I have vague memories of the 3DS one. I don't remember it being anything particularly special.
It's like a bespoke 3DS game though that was separate to them.
Yeah, but it was still just simple 2D platformer.
But one that kind of evoked those Mega Drive games that were acclaimed and stuff.
I'm not wild about Epic Mickey or Dylan, but I think the PlayStation saved your life.
£4 is really good. That's great. Yeah, I wish I had a PS2 again.
I miss having a PS2.
So yes, you shall live.
Well then, it's 6-5 in my favour. Maybe I will get this 40% death rate after all. Next one's from Ian Livingston.
Matthew, not the guy who founded Games Workshop.
It's very surprising if he listened to this bullshit.
Hello, Samuel and Matthew, big fan of the show, a weekly highlight in the cycle of podcasts. My submission is Metroid Other M, which I purchased last month for £7 plus £1.83 delivery. Never played it at the time, but started getting on the Metroid Dread hype train and found a glowing review in an old GameStem that I kept.
It got 9 out of 10. Fuck me, that's way too high. And I say that as a former editor of GameStem.
Thanks for the hours of free entertainment. It is really appreciated. So Matthew, we talked a bit about Metroid Other M in our Best Games of 2010 episode.
I think we came down on thinking it wasn't quite as bad as people said it was, right?
I've got a secret soft spot for this. It's interesting, actually. Rich Stanton was tweeting about this just the other day, that it's a game that's kind of been defined by dumb memes, by people who haven't played it, probably.
Like, they've just watched the shitty cutscenes, which are shit. The story in Other M is terrible. But as an actual game, it's kind of interesting.
It's got an interesting combat system that's based around evasive dodges that quickly power up your weapons. It's kind of a weird hybrid of the kind of 2D style and a 3D action game. It's very, very polished, you know, very slick, exciting monster animation.
It may not be what a lot of people wanted from Metroid, but I think as a standalone thing, it's fine. And it's a game that's been defined by a couple of like, dunk videos on Twitter. And the day that we start listening to dunk videos and letting them design the conversation is a sad day indeed.
By dunk videos, you don't mean young men being dunked in front of Michael Caine in a water tank.
No, I mean, well, listen, no, that's not a video. That's real, that's a dunk. I'm pro-dunking.
Don't get me wrong.
Maybe the content could be filmed and like distributed afterwards so the court can make a bit of money back on the case.
Yeah, I mean, that's an incredibly sinister side business, even by this court's standards. I don't know if I want to get into snuff films with Michael Caine weeping in the background. I like other, I think I need to stand up for it more.
I do like it. Like I reviewed this, I gave this like a high 80s in NGamer. I do like this game and it annoys me that the conversation is defined by just a few sort of sarcastic tweeters and YouTubers who just show the same cutscenes.
You don't play a game's cutscenes, you don't play, you know, if you judge a game by its cutscenes, you know, you're fundamentally a dim person. So yeah, you are saved. This is a good purchase.
Yeah, that's a good price as well, I think, seven quid.
Yeah.
That's all right. The Wii market isn't quite as badly like hit by the massive upswing in retro prices as some of the other Nintendo hardware. So yeah, I think this was, I said on that podcast, I thought it was like an absolutely beautiful looking Wii game as well.
Nintendo is just gonna have to re-release this for its reputation to be reclaimed a little bit, I think, Matthew. So whether it ever will or not is a mystery. Probably not, but yeah.
Okay, so that is seven still alive, five drowned in front of Michael Caine. So that's where we're at. Yes, we go into the final few here.
This is Jack McMahan is the 13th defendant. Your honor, if it pleases the games court, I would like to represent myself in this here matter. Oh, okay, well then you don't want my help at all, Jack.
I mean, now I wish that you drowned. So, now, ladies and gentlemen of the games court, I am but a simple country boy, but recent circumstances of employment have impressed upon me the need to move overseas. Modern aviation baggage requirements necessitated that I leave my PS4 behind in my home on the prairie, hoping one day to reunite with it.
Unfortunately, my time in the big city has corrupted me with its materialistic ways and low morals, compelling me to make a purchase at the local games merchant game. And so, on the 7th of June this year, I declare before God and man that I purchase both The Last of Us titles.
Quick side note, there is no God on Castle Island.
Only Man. Only Man. It's like a botched version of the Andrew Ryan thing.
It's like idiot bioshock. There is no God on Matthew Castle Island, full stop. Only Man, no full stop afterwards.
Bioshlub.
Oh, okay. I paid £8.99 for the PS4 remaster of part 1. Hereafter referred to as exhibit A and £14.99 for part 2, exhibit B, which I believe to be a fair price for new physical copies of these games.
Consider also the esteem with which exhibits A and B are held by members of the gaming community. There's quite a lot more here Matthew. We'll just go straight to this bit which says finally Mr. Wario, if I am fortunate enough to be spared on this, my day of reckoning, I hope you will not be too disappointed to give me your autograph.
Big fan. Well if you survive then Jack, then perhaps Wario can give you that. I leave it to the court to decide whether it has the jurisdiction to execute people for purchases not made on eBay as I'd already finished writing this defence when I noticed that particular detail.
I have now said my piece and must resign myself to my fate. So Jack, the eBay thing is just a name, like you can buy games from anywhere, so that doesn't count against you, but Matthew, The Last of Us and Last of Us Part 2, these seem like good prices to me. I don't think this is particularly dramatic.
What are the prices again? I must admit when you've read the prices I was still laughing at Bio Shlub.
To yourself, off mic. Very good. Great laughing at his own joke.
What great podcasting. £8.99 for the first one, £40.99 for Part 2. So that's like less than £30 for both of those games.
Those are good games. That's a good price.
Bit of a miserable time you're going to have, but you can't really knock them. You know, I paid full whack for Last of Us 2. Yeah, why not?
Sure. That seems decent.
Yeah. He also added a detail that he has bought the Skyward Sword remake as well, but didn't put out for court because that was a brand new purchase. So that might work in his favour too.
Trying to sweeten the deal.
Yep, because everyone knows that Matthew Castle famously likes Skyward Sword. So that makes…
Famously.
Well, he's come up on this podcast three times.
Yeah, he has, yeah.
Okay, well there you go. I'm looking forward to…
I'm afraid though that you won't be getting Wario's signature because Wario in quote marks has actually been wheeled out on a hospital gurney. He's fallen ill because, as we all know, Dustin Hoffman is an amazing method actor and ate so much garlic preparing for the role that he's fallen sick.
What's funny is that this ties in quite nicely to the moving out of the country into the big city thing, which has a big midnight cowboy vibe from there. Dustin Hoffman, just to kind of complete the effect, is now coughing to death. So Jack can put his coat around him and they can try and move on to a better life.
Defendant number 14. I'm looking forward to Bio Shlub Infinite, by the way, Matthew, when you build a city in the sky. But racism maybe?
I don't know.
No, ideally not.
Okay, there you go. That could be the mantra when people arrive. Racism?
Ideally not. And Bio Shlub Infinite. Okay, good.
Okay, 14th defendant is Hayes Red Mist, another of our frequent listeners and correspondents. So Hayes Red Mist then says, I recently purchased for the princely sum of £5 a copy of Super Mario Maker on the Wii U. Not from eBay, but from someone I know.
Shout out to Jamie at RGC if you're listening. I don't think that Matthew Castle Island allows shout outs that may count against you. I've owned this game three separate times before due to a history of selling it on and regretting it, and in fact still don't have the latest purchase in my possession.
It's at Jamie's house, but I somehow had to own it again for the remote possibility. I'll play it with the kids when they're old enough, and it's generally accepted that the Wii U version is better than the Switch one due to the second screen. Matthew, we've not really talked much about Super Mario Maker before, but I get the sense it's the sort of thing that you wouldn't be big on, because I think you said before you're not big into content creation games, you just like playing games.
Is that where you're at?
They make me feel very bad and lazy is the problem, and I know everyone says these games exist to give you everyone else's content, so you don't have to feel bad and lazy, but fundamentally the purpose of the thing is to make something and feel cool about that, and I'm just not very creative in that sense. I'm not a secret level designer waiting to happen, I don't think. It's really elegantly made, and I've played with it enough to know that it's a superb piece of kit and designed very cleverly to let you build compelling levels, but it does have that fundamental flaw of I just don't have the desire to make those things.
It's what like Doom's Little Big Planet dreams to an extent. I mean, they're things I admire, they're just not things I personally want to play, and be reminded of how much better my peers are. But that maybe says more about me.
The one exception is WarioWare DIY, because I think the nature of that, the length of the games, how throw away and kind of rough they are, actually does fit my tastes. Even I can come up with three seconds of content.
Well, there you go, Hayes Redmond.
But this isn't about WarioWare.
No, if you'd have picked WarioWare, you wouldn't be drowning right now.
This is also buy it, get rid of it, buy it, get rid of it. I find that quite wearying. I swear I've punished you for this in the past.
I think so, yeah.
I think that's both you. And unfortunately, it's wherever the game resides, they're also guilty. So it's your friend Jamie as well.
Both at the same time?
You can choose. The same tank or different tanks?
Would they both fit in the same tank? It was a bit of a tight squeeze, I think.
To be honest, that's the least of your worries with that tank.
Okay, yeah, alright, so...
It'll wake old Kane up, though.
Bloody hell, there's two of them this time. There you go. Alright, so, okay, that's like eight to six, Matthew.
So actually, like, I'm not going to lose this, but, you know, it could be 50-50, it could be a tie.
So at the very least, you'll have to rewrite your website.
Yeah, I still have, you know, I still have six dead bodies on my hand, which is, wait, no, seven dead bodies, technically, when you throw Jamie in.
Eight, if we include Dustin Hoffman, who I regret to tell the court, he has died.
That's, that's bleak. Let's move on. So, penultimate one here, this is from Ben, 15th defendant.
To the good people of the court, I present my own bad eBay Games purchase. A few weeks prior to the start of the first lockdown in 2020, I managed to buy a GBA SP through Facebook Market for just £30 and a nice electric blue in absolute steel compared to current prices. Needing some games to play on my new brackets old system, I went to eBay to grab some GBA Classics where I found a double pack of A Link to the Past and Four Swords for just £14, bargain bin prices.
Or so I thought as I jumped on the deal. A week later, when my games finally arrived, I was slightly disappointed to find that the listing must have been wrong. It wasn't A Link to the Past I was getting, but rather The Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap.
Judging by the quality of the cart and the very obviously home-printed label, I'm guessing the seller could have put any GBA game they wanted on there. But there I was with a fake version of not The Legend of Zelda a game I wanted. I had certainly been had.
The Minish Cap is still a good game though. There we go, Matthew, a bootleg purchase there. I think the GBA SP, that's a great price for that.
I don't know what the state of batteries is like on a console that old, that's got a rechargeable battery.
Yeah, I don't really know.
Buying a fake game, I feel like that price was probably a bit too good to be true, and then clearly it was. Where are you at with that?
Yeah, I'd rather have the Minish Cap than Link to the Past though, as already explained on the Zelda podcast.
Yeah, a beautiful looking Zelda game.
If I punish them, this could be like a warning about the perils of buying bootleg GBA games.
To the youth of Matthew Castle Island.
I mean, they can't buy stuff online because I don't let anyone have the internet here.
That's how the other ways, other ways, North Korea vibes. Otherwise, they'll find out you're on Interpol's most wanted list.
And I don't want anyone finding out what the time is.
A watch is not allowed either. Then was there like a kind of like a watch armistice, like everyone had to surrender their watches at the border, basically. North Korea, but Dustin Hoffman's there dressed as Wario.
What the fuck are we doing with our lives? What is this podcast? What are we making, Matthew?
This is terrible. This is the end of this podcast.
We'll just get like a credible games media guest. Come on and bail us out in a couple of weeks. Yeah, balance it out a little bit.
So, back to the...
Minish Cap.
I'm going to let this go because I like Minish Cap.
Okay, even though it's fake, you know.
Fake Minish Cap is still better than real. Link to the past.
Well, I mean, that's just not true, is it? But I mean, I appreciate the preposterous take on this scenario.
Listen, it's my court.
That's true. I mean, yeah, if you come to the Matthew Castle's court, you play by his rules and you can never leave or know the time.
Also, are you really arguing against me saving your client? You are the worst defence attorney I've ever met.
Look, I just believe in real justice, OK? And however we get there, that's whatever it takes, Matthew. I'm prepared to go there.
That's actually like very Ace Attorney of you. But the role of the court is to get to the truth no matter who does it.
Much like you, everything I know about the law, I've learned from Ace Attorney.
You've successfully saved another client. Congrats.
Thank you. So we've reached the final client. So before I get to my bad purchase, I just want to say I really love the podcast.
It's a highlight of my week, thank you. Mike is the 16th and final defendant. Oh, it's a good one to end with, Matthew.
I once bought 50 cent Bulletproof on PS3 from eBay for 11 pounds. A friend once bought me Blood on the Sand as a gag Christmas gift. It was a risible, terrible game, but at the time I was trying to build a physical collection of PS3 games and it annoyed the ever loving piss out of me that I had half of the series.
I bought Bulletproof to complete the series. Never opened the case. I just put it on my shelf and let my OCD breathe a sigh of relief.
So I don't think Bulletproof was actually released on PS3. So I think they might mean PS2. Basically people who don't know, for some reason, because it was the mid-naughties, there was a 50 cent game, there was a video game based on him that was complete shit, and then there was a much better video game that was made by a UK based studio in the Unreal Engine and actually looked pretty good.
That spawned the, where the fuck is my skull meme or whatever it was, because he's looking for a skull with diamonds on it in the game. But it was actually a fairly solid shooter and had a bit of a better tone than that first one. So that's a little bit of an overview of the 50 cent games, Matthew, did you ever play through these?
I don't feel like they're your sort of energy.
No, I'm shamefully, I've lived them entirely through other people, a bit like other people have with other M, so I only know them as the memes. My read was that Blood on the Sand was, yeah, was the okay one. You know, it's a bit kind of ironically sort of shit, but that the original is actually quite charmless and bad.
That did lead also to the excellent Charlie Brooker joke, Noam Chomsky, Blood on the Sand, that was pretty funny. But yeah, so yes, Blood on the Sand there. So what does the judge think?
Is there, you've got one bad game there, because they're not actually putting Blood on the Sand on trial.
No, that's it, that's the problem. They're putting the bad, charmless one. That's got to be worth a dunking.
I think so, yeah. Sorry, Mike.
Yeah, I like that we're in agreement. Thank you, councillor.
I just thought, you know, I think I've hit my 40% target, so, you know, I don't... Yeah, that's it. That's a tough break.
So yeah, so what's going to happen here is Mike will be drowned with 50 cent bulletproof, but I will take his copy of Blood on the Sand home with me. That's like my treat for myself, and I'll go pay that on my Xbox 360. Surely you're no win, no fee when you go to that section of my website just says TBA.
No win. I take your stuff. It's not like you need it.
It's like Lionel Harts. There's a lot of different commas in there and exclamation marks. Yeah.
So yes, good. So let's just tie all that up, Matthew. I believe it's nine, nine surviving to seven deaths.
So I actually haven't hit my quota, but you know, I got close enough, which again, if you look at like the terms and conditions on my site, it says, or as close as possible to 40% fatality rate.
So yeah, it does say it, so we've got to we've got to, you know, recognise that.
Does the judge have any closing statements to make about the accused and the seven drowned young men?
I feel like this was pretty fair this time. You know, I feel like we all know why they died. We've got them in the tanks with their crimes, so that, you know, we can put them in a public place for everyone to see them and, like, understand what they did wrong.
I'm sorry to have put Michael Caine through that. I don't really know what your role in this is, to be honest. You just sit there, I guess.
But I'm sorry to have traumatised you. I'm announcing a day of mourning for Dustin Hoffman.
Right.
But otherwise, I think this was pretty successful. I think justice was served. I've given my people what they want, so that's another few months of peace on Castle Island.
Another few months where they won't question why they can't go on the internet or indeed know the time.
If I was there, I'd consider going to South Matthew Castle Island, which is actually like a liberal paradise with a lot of good pop music.
It's got a great film scene.
Yeah, a lot of good pop music as well, yeah.
And the hit number one show on Netflix at the moment.
Oh, sorry, I mean, there's no such thing as Netflix People of Castle Island. I don't know what that is. Next.
Okay, so, yeah, I mean, the role of Michael Caine in this was to basically like underline the prestige reference of the prop, otherwise it's just men being drowned. But when you add that, it gives it a little bit of pop culture colour, I think, that's incredibly valuable. I just want to point out, for legal purposes, as a qualified lawyer in this kangaroo court, Dustin Hoffman, the real Dustin Hoffman, is alive and well.
So just in case this is used as like a primary news source for him being dead, dressed as Wario and smelling of garlic, I'd sort of make it clear that that never happened. Just for the sanctity of this podcast and to not get us thrown off of Apple podcasts. So yeah, any closing thoughts, Matthew?
I find it very endearing that you are genuinely concerned about the Dustin Hoffman thing.
Well, you just got to be careful. You know, yeah, dot all your i's, cross all your t's, etc. Well, Gamescourt is over.
They all filter out a badly rendered Chewbacca and badly rendered Indiana Jones are catching up because they're old friends. They've obviously worked together before.
Yeah, this has the potential to be our worst podcast yet or our best. I think it'll all happen in the edit basically. And then like at the other side, people will know if magic happened or something terrible happened.
Side though, it is quite funny to think about the prospect that we've built a whole concept around drowning our own listeners. Like does any other podcast give you that each week?
I mean, I mean, that's that is like this American life's whole thing.
Yeah, I believe so. So Matthew, to close out, we have about three listening questions here. Let's kick off with this one from Chris Doherty, who was Chris drowned?
I don't remember. But Chris was certainly…
I don't remember their names. It's how I sleep at night.
Yeah, exactly. Well, either way, if this is from beyond the grave, then so be it. Greetings, you two.
I'll ask a sensible question this time. You've spoken about your console gaming experiences, but what about your time at the arcades? Did you slash do you often visit arcades on holidays?
What games would you play first with the limited pocket change you were given as a nipper? And what are your all-time favourites? Does Bath have any decent arcades there that you visit?
I fucking wish. Jesus. Bath barely has a supermarket, I mean, ugh.
Bournemouth used to have some decent arcades along the seafront and on the pier that I would visit often as a kid as well. Sadly, the Sega Worlds are frequent here in Japan, pale in comparison to the ones of yesteryear. They're usually just all filled with those crap claw games and horse racing betting machines, mostly with a spattering of fighting games and some obscure card-based RTS games.
Super lame. Thanks as always, Chris Doherty. So that's arcade games, Matthew.
Do you have any all-time favourites?
I mean, I must admit, I don't have a huge history with arcades because I guess the kind of places we went to didn't have them. When you're a kid, arcades seem like very expensive and if you've got parents who aren't massively into games, they're not willing to give you money to just throw away on like 20 seconds of being very bad at a Jurassic Park light world game. My experience of arcades as a kid was like occasionally getting to play one at a bowling alley on a friend's birthday party.
I have some strong thoughts on this one, Matthew. I was a massive fan of the Star Wars trilogy arcade machine. Not the one that originally existed in the 80s, I think, but there was one that was made in the 90s by Sega.
Do you ever play that one? I thought it was brilliant.
I've not played it, but I know the one you're talking about, yeah.
Oh yeah, that's really good. That basically lets you fire through the major set pieces from the different ones. Have any come to mind, Matthew, for you, from recalling?
Yeah, you know, there are mostly all light gun games, like the Jurassic Park one, where you're in the Jeep and the T-Rex is chasing you. That stays in my head as a memory. To be honest, my big arcade memory was we used to go on holiday to Southwold every year on the coast over in the southeast and Southwold Pier had an arcade and that was mostly like the horse racing game where you bet like 2p and those kind of coin drop machines.
But I remember my dad playing the Star Trek, the next generation pinball machine a lot. I like pinball machines an awful lot.
Oh, that pinball machine was rad, actually. That was really good.
Yeah, there was just that era of like licensed machines that just had so much fun with the license and the sound clips and the kind of the law that they took and kind of managed to squeeze into every machine was always super impressive. And Kitzy, who I used to work with on Endgame magazine, owned a Adam's family pinball machine, which I always thought the sound of that, you know, the idea of owning one of those things is amazing, because there's so much to them, you know, that, you know, if I had a bigger house, I would, that's something I would love to own one day.
That's so like a pre millennial story that is, I have the space and own an arcade machine, you know what I mean? Like in a large enough property to facilitate it.
Our common room at university had a medieval madness pinball machine, which is quite a quite a famous machine, it's got sound clips from Tina Fey, weirdly, it had a cast list on it. I think a very young Tina Fey supplied some of the squawking sound bites for it.
You make that money, Tina, whatever you got to do to get 30 Rocks off the ground.
Pinball voiceover artist, how are you at saying multi-ball, things like that? Yeah, I wish I'd played them more. I have some peers who did have the arcade culture in their childhood a bit more, and it allows them to speak a bit more elegantly on certain things or appreciate certain things.
But, you know, I definitely dig it. I just sort of dig it from afar.
Yeah. I did grow up in coastal towns and, you know, arcades are really an uphill battle to find an arcade culture in the UK that just isn't much of it at all. And then what was there has just obviously ebbed away as arcade culture has everywhere.
But in Gunwolf Keys in Portsmouth, where weirdly where Silent Hill Shad Memories was made, there was an arcade in their bowling alley there that had a Police 24-7 machine, which is the one where you have to dodge the bullets that are coming towards you. So you actually, I remember there's a little notice on it that said, don't wear a hat or the sensors won't work, which I thought was quite funny. But that was cool.
They had Crazy Taxi as well. They also had, I think it was House of the Dead 2 or 3, whichever the most recent one was then. It was the one I think that had shotguns that you could reload.
That was really rad. They had the Star Wars Racer arcade machine, which wasn't that good. All of these are extremely expensive because it was like a new development.
So like 50p or a quid, that's another massive barrier to playing these obviously. Yeah, and other ones like my parents actually live in one of these like Devon towns that have little arcades. And their arcade is a bit rubbish, but it does have a crazy taxi machine in there.
The framerate is really bad on it. I don't know why. That's kind of a bummer.
It's a thing where you put 50p in to play it and you're like, I could literally download this game on my iPad, it would run better. And like, and it's free. So yeah, that's tough.
But you know.
I always found, you know, as a kid going to these places, that they scared me a bit. And the noise and the lights of the machine and everything. I mean, the thing that used to freak me out was the idea of it drawing loads of attention to me.
Like I was too shy to play arcade machines, which may sound really dumb. But like when, because when someone actually puts money into these things, people are bound to come and look because they just want to see someone playing it. And then you've got like, performance anxiety, because you don't want to be like absolutely tanking at this arcade machine, but it's so loud and everyone is naturally drawn to it.
That used to stress me out a lot.
Yeah, my first experience of embarrassing myself in front of a girl happened with, I have a whole arc with Star Wars Trilogy Arcade Machine, actually, which is, I was on a PLO ferry on a school trip in year seven, I was walking around this ferry with this girl all day, we stopped to the arcade, we watched this guy finish Star Wars Trilogy Arcade with one credit, like he did the entire thing. And then I stepped up, it was my turn. And I died in the Battle of Yavin within about 20 seconds, and it was like, quite humiliating.
And then years later, I think it was 2016, when my parents moved to this town, I went to Torquay, and basically spent eight quid finishing the game. And like, I was like, so I'm an adult, I've got disposable income, I'm going to fucking complete my like arc with this game, and beat it. And I did, I blasted through it, and I defeated Darth Vader in the little bonus, like, Super Battle thing too.
That felt pretty good. So that game is so, so good. I love that game.
Did you ring up the girl from your childhood to tell her what you finally achieved?
Yeah, I was like, Stephanie, I did it. And she's like, Samuel, I've not heard from you in 15 years, like, what the fuck? Yeah.
Oh, I can just imagine how awkward the rest of that fairy trip was, where she's like, oh, God, I can't believe you yav-ind it.
It was a bit like that. But the thing is, why do I remember that, Matthew? It was so many years ago, but I do.
Oh dear.
These formative experiences, they scar you for life.
But I actually, I really love arcade games. I've got a couple more to mention. So I've mentioned the Las Vegas Arcade in Soho in London.
That rules. It's got that Mario Kart machine, which is, you know, basically the worst version of Mario Kart you can play apart from the Wii one. But it's really nice to just sit in it because you and another player, I think one player operates a turret on the back of the kart while one player is driving.
I think that's how it works. It's a kind of co-op experience. And me and my girlfriend did that a couple of years ago.
That was really fun. Taiko no Tatsujin, obviously a really obvious one. But you know, whenever you find a machine of that, that's just a great experience, isn't it?
And I played the Rhythm Heaven game there as well. I think they had a Bishibashi machine of some kind too, that was imported from Japan. So that arcade absolutely rules.
You should totally go there if you get a chance. Alright, next question. Do you want to read out the next one, Matthew?
Indulge me as I potentially open up a can of worms. Having once worked in Bath for the better part of a year, it might surprise you to hear that I've never tasted the meat-drenched jorries of JC's kitchen. However, one independent food outlet I became quite fond of whilst there was Chaiwala.
The onion bhaji wrap is legendary to me now, and I don't think I've tasted a better brand of Indian street food anywhere else. Have either of you been to Chaiwala? If so, what do you think?
The main guy there is a super nice dude, enough that I always felt bad when not grabbing the offered soft drink in addition to my usual wrap. Keep up the great musings, Aaron Potter. It's time for the podcast where we do a lunchtime food deep dive in Bath.
Yep. Thoughts on Chaiwala, Matthew?
I like Chaiwala very much. Yeah, it basically does onion bhaji wraps or falafel wraps, I think.
Yeah.
It's quite a small little store, but there's always a massive queue, which is a good sign. Crunchy salad, a bit of mango chutney, some other mysterious sauces.
I think it's like hummus and chutney mostly, yeah.
Yeah. Tamarind.
Okay, I like that you remember that. Well done.
Whatever that is.
It's that little powdery stuff that goes in there.
I don't know what that is. But it's in there.
We're very culturally up on our...
It's very nice, very, very filling, good samosas, ex-samosas, in fact, I'd say the samosas are the best bit there. I think Bath's pretty good for food, given that it's not what you would think of as like a, you know, particularly cosmopolitan or international city. It's got some surprisingly, some surprisingly good regional food offerings.
Yeah, I think Bath is great for food. It's like, considering it's a very small city, really, but you know, the number of great restaurants per, you know, square mile. I mean, there's probably about 10, 10 places I really love in Bath, and like a second tier of places that are like just okay.
And then there's like the death tier of like tapas, naff tapas places in Southgate, I think are a complete fucking write off. So you know, it's a bit of a toss up there. I think Chaiwala is excellent.
I wish he took card payments. He still doesn't. Even though if you go on to like Just Eat, you can go order it on there with your card.
I don't understand how that works. That kind of bothers me.
Everything else about it, I love. I should have clarified. This is a bit of the podcast where we do a deep dive into a local bath eatery and criticize some of the business factors.
I will say though, unlike JC's Kitchen, he has a great venue. It's like a doorway basically. The only good falafel in Bath, I would say, controversially.
A great eatery if you're going to Bath for the day and not that expensive. I underline what Matthew said about the samosa, lovely crispy corners on that samosa, Matthew. Delicious.
JC's Kitchen, if you're listening, consider getting a doorway so I can come buy your meat on tap.
It's got a tent. You can't put a door in a tent.
I get the impression that maybe an indoor venue doesn't work for him because of the smoked meat and it creates so much smoke inhalation is not good.
Interesting.
It has to be a tent venue.
You don't want to get old chicken lung.
Yeah, it's a common cause of death in Bath, I believe. Yeah, it's probably how I'll go. Okay.
Hi gents. Long time listener, second time questioner. Love the podcast.
Great chemistry between the hosts. Something something meat tent. Something something shootakumi versus yushinaka.
Something something god in space. Anyway, I really enjoyed the magazine rivalries podcast with Dan Dawkins. Dan himself is a great speaker.
However, his force of personality meant you two didn't get a chance to say much about your own magazine rivalries. Were there any memorable MAG rival moments in your own careers that you feel comfortable discussing? As someone who grew up with NGamer, the rivalry with O&M felt like quite read like quite a big thing.
And I'd love to hear more about that if it won't get Matthew sued. Keep up the great work, Balladeer. Yeah, I mean, Matthew, I feel like Dan, I didn't I didn't mind Dan hijacking that podcast because he had so many great stories.
And his own his own story about telling me that I don't think anything of play magazine was like a key mag rivalry moment for me. But what do you think? What's your answer to this one, Matthew?
Yeah, it's tricky because obviously O&M were like another future mag. So fundamentally, we're all pulling in the same direction. But like there is a there is a rivalry.
But also to call it a rivalry is ridiculous because O&M was so far ahead and just the natural place to put anything. It wasn't like we could take them down. You know, we very rarely, you know, got a scoop on on anything.
So I think we were resigned quite early on to, you know, you can't battle them. You can certainly enjoy it when, you know, you thought they made a bad cover choice or there was something naff in there or whatever. And we certainly did.
And we'd laugh about it. I mean, for the early years, our rivalry was actually with the imagine Nintendo Mag more than anything. They had an unofficial Nintendo Mag as well, N Revolution.
Mad. Side note. Why the fuck did they name that magazine Revolution?
Well, when that magazine launched, the Wii was no longer called Revolution. It would have made sense if that had still been the name of the Wii. But they changed it anyway.
I guess calling it NWii is kind of weird as well. Sounds like odd-Wii. Which I guess makes sum up the experience of working on a Wii magazine.
That's good. I like that. Yes, we had a rival with them.
I mean, to be honest, because there were fewer press trips and things like that, you actually very rarely were in direct contact with anyone from these other mags. I had a horrible early experience in my first six months where I went to a review event and got sat... This was when they were still doing the Wii house, and I actually got sat next to someone from N Revolution.
And they were there. There were two of them from the mag, and one of them was genuinely rude to me and kept making jokes about how I was doing in the game that I was playing, which has never happened to me before. I won't say who this person is, but they're like, yeah, awful.
Which was a shame, because the rest of the stuff when I met them were really nice. So that's probably my most heated journalism moment, but to be honest, rather smugly, we were really confident in NGamer, we really loved what we were making. I still think it was the best Nintendo mag from that era, by quite some distance, so I didn't really care about the other mags, to be honest.
Which may sound horribly egocentric, but I think you also have to have that mindset to make the mag and make it as good as you can be. If you're constantly worrying, like, is it good enough, is it good enough, then it probably isn't. I was quite happy and confident with how we were with O&M.
Like, fundamentally, you want to be professional, I ended up editing O&M. You know, like, the worst thing you want to do is slag someone off and then you end up working with them. So yeah, I didn't, I didn't, we didn't have any, like, major beefs that flared up, apart from that one terrible review event.
But that was N Revolution and they were seen gone from the picture, so no worries.
Uh, that's interesting, because when I got to imagine, actually, I don't even know if N Revolution had a team anymore. Simon got moved to X360 maybe, I don't remember, but.
Yeah, it wasn't, Simon, I don't, you know, Simon has only ever been a really standard dude whenever I've met him, so.
Yeah, Simon Miller, that is, a very nice guy and a wrestler man. We should have him on at some point, I think that'd be fun. For me, it was weird, because I didn't think Play was the best PlayStation magazine when I was working on it.
I thought that the official mag was. It was beautifully designed, that mag. Quite far ahead of its time, I think, in terms of, like, what a mag looked like in 2006, 2007.
It had a new section I really liked, where it was, it kind of just did, like, a top ten, and that was their news. And it was kind of, like, part interview, part newsy stuff. I think I like the idea of a new, I think the way you have to do news these days in a magazine is, like, featurey news, where you're almost making the news yourself, and interviewing people and stuff, or delivering, like, a, you know, analysis to things.
And I liked how they did that, for that mag looked great. I thought Play looked a little bit old hat by comparison, and didn't have much love put into the features and stuff. But, yeah, I don't know, like, I thought it was, I thought it was about as good as PSN3 was at the time, PSW, I didn't think there was loads in it, personally.
But the, over time, I don't know, on X360, it got a little bit more competitive with Xbox World. I remember, like, one issue, we started doing making-offs, we did, like, a four-page making-off, and then, like, two issues later, they did, like, a 12-page making-off on Alan Wake, I think, and it was a bit like, oh, okay, they've seen we're doing this, and they're like, oh, we can do a better version. So that's an example of how mag rivalries could work.
Yeah, yeah, we had, there was, there was one time, there was like, there's one caption in an early issue of NGamer, which, like, actively poked fun at a member of staff on a rival magazine, which we probably shouldn't have done. It wasn't my doing. I think it was something greener, right?
At the time, I thought it was absolutely hilarious. And if people own a collection, they can probably go back and find it in there somewhere. We got as close to spicy as you can possibly be.
That was fun. And funnily enough, I think the biggest problem I had when I went to O&M was actually nothing to do with the mag. It was like the forums, because on there, they loved O&M, obviously, and there wasn't like a lot of love for NGamer.
And I felt like there were a couple of people who were like quite actively hostile. And because of that, I kind of took against the forums quite a lot. Like, I didn't really care for the forums and I think O&M had a much healthier relationship like, before that time, the staff had been quite close to the forums, but I kind of deliberately tried to cut them off a bit, which I maybe shouldn't have done in hindsight.
But yeah, so that's it. My rivalry was with an entire readership.
Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, apart from that, I don't know, when I was on Games TM, I suppose, there was like, Games TM kind of, Edge was its main competitor. I suppose I always kind of envied Edge's access a little bit, because they would always be like, first on people's lists.
So even when I was on PC Gamer, I remember like, vying for a Deus Ex Mankind Divided cover and I think that Scranix said that like, oh, the devs want to do Edge first. And I was like, okay, well, that just sort of speaks to their standing a little bit. That happened a couple of times.
But you know, I settled having a Just Cause 3 cover. That was fine. So yeah, yeah, I, the bits here are there.
I feel like it's another of those things where I arrived slightly too late to the party for that stuff to be like a really is like, as bitter as it could be, as Dan described it, like in terms of, you know, just much more fiercely competitive and stuff. So I think that's slightly before my time and I tried to be nice to the stuff I met you.
I think our era is like, anyone doing a magazine, you understand like how hard it was.
Yeah.
And it's just like respect to anyone who can keep a mag running.
Yeah, that's how I feel about all people who work on magazines, like well done for turning up and doing it, you know. Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, good. Well, that's a good note to end on there, Matthew. So as we wrap up, I will say that the podcast, by the time this episode goes out, we would have passed 100,000 downloads, Matthew.
And that's in like, what, nine months, a little bit over nine months, that's like. And you know, the podcast has had lots of nice reviews on Apple podcasts. We get a lot of correspondence through Twitter, passed a thousand followers on there.
We get downloaded three thousand times a week plus at the moment, which is amazing. We found an audience. I just wondered if you had any thoughts, Matthew, on where we're at?
Oh, well, you know, I'm still really enjoying it. You know, I hope, you know, other people are still enjoying it. I hope people are enjoying the mix of different episodes that we're doing.
Like, I think the last couple of months, you know, sort of shown the scope and variety, I guess, of like what we can do. And, you know, I know that when we chat about it, like we've got exciting plans, you know, for the rest of the year and looking further ahead and, you know, hope to kind of keep it keep it going for it hasn't got like an end date or anything like that. You know, we still still plan to keep growing it and developing it and hopefully like, you know, building on some of the community stuff that we've, you know, we built up, it feels like we built up a nice little community around it.
And so to kind of continue building on that and, you know, just hopefully keep making fun, fun episodes.
Yeah, that's how I feel too. I mean, you know, when we started this, I was, I just, I knew Matthew was the person to do a podcast with. I knew it'd be a, it'd be a fun back and forth at the core of it.
And then I feel like we treated it almost like with a magazine like style of, you know, thinking about the variety of it and the stuff that will get people excited and a mix of cool guests and stuff. And yeah, I am, it's been really awesome to see it grow so quickly. And that's definitely thanks, you know, partly to our peers have come on here, like Joe helped us find a load of people, David Turner on the Computer Games Show helped us find a load of people too.
Oh, instantly. I listened to their, it'll probably be their episode two weeks ago now, but there was an episode they had an ad reading on it for a Blue Yeti mic. That is one of the most spectacular things I've heard in a long time.
So if you haven't listened to their podcasts, do go and check that out.
Yep. And all that has helped us find an audience. And so we massively appreciate your support.
And yeah, no plans to stop. We'll just keep doing it. I'm sure we probably, I think I've got at least another year's worth of ideas sort of swimming around in my head at the moment.
We still haven't done best father fantasy games, best Star Wars games. We've got drafts to do. You know, like we mentioned, we, PS Vita, I think we should do a PS1 redux draft, Matthew.
And we should do things on like best licensed games. We thought about doing a seven out of ten games episode and stuff like that. So loads and loads we want to do still.
Bringing on more guests, matching them to their specialist subjects, hopefully digging deeper into stuff which, you know, we don't know necessarily know everything about should be fun as well. We've got loads more listeners to kill off in Gamescore.
Yeah, we'll probably do another list in Gamescore if we get a good response to this episode down the line. Like I say, it could be the best or worst episode ever made. Only you can decide.
But lots planned down the line basically. So thank you very much for your support. So if you'd like to follow the podcast on Twitter, it's Back Page Pod.
If you'd like to send us a question or a possible future Gamescore exhibit so we can discuss that in a future episode, backpagegames.gmail.com. Matthew, where can people find you on Twitter?
I am at MrBazzill underscore pesto.
I'm Samuel W. Roberts. Thank you very much for listening and we'll be back next week.
