Hello and welcome to the back page of video game as podcast. My name is Samuel Roberts and I'm joined as ever by Matthew Castle. Hello. Do I normally say my name is Samuel Roberts?

Matthew
00:29
No you don't. Why you did it differently, but that's fine.

Samuel
00:31
It's because I just ate a kilo of nachos before starting this. I'm probably just ready for bed to be honest, Matthew, but um instead we're gonna do a three hour drive Episode probably with returning guests Dave Scarborough and Ashley Day. I'll start with you Ash because you're a more reasonable man than Dave. How are you doing? I'm not bad.

Ash
00:47
I'm quite jealous of your Nacho news. Uh to be honest, I had some pasta with tuna.

Samuel
00:54
Yeah.

Ash
00:55
Um and I'm but I'm not ready for bed. I'm I'm raring to go. Ready to talk about levels that I can't remember very well.

Samuel
01:01
That's funny, because two minutes ago you said I'm fucked in this draft and uh before we started recording. Yeah, but yes, I mean but in a way, you fucked us all by insisting on a light gun category, didn't you?

Ash
01:13
I don't know why I did that in retrospect.

Samuel
01:15
A terrible idea because there are about Five good light gun games, maybe ten. Like draft winning sort of picks. I feel like there's only like really two or three. So um dramatic, and as someone pointed out on blue sky We don't have a stealth levels category, which is a major self-own, so fucking hitman, dishonored, all just chucked out the window, you have to pick him and free pick, truly. a disaster in planning out of the gates. But um it's delightful to have you back on Ash. Dave, how you didn't uh I'm doing good.

Dave Scarborough
01:42
I feel I feel pretty good about this one. The last couple of drafts I've done like the previous draft I had like some health stuff. I was I was like all in my head, Sam. And then the top draft before that you dragged me on after I'd been throwing up the day before and so I wasn't like giving a hundred hundred percent. So really I'm I'm at f You know, full health, mentally robust.

Samuel
02:02
I uh I'm raring to go. He's done a bit of the old uh Matthew underdog shtick, who sort of sowed the seeds of I've been I've been down and out but now I'm ready to come back and

Dave Scarborough
02:12
How could a man draft effectively when he had so many fingers up the bum in such a short space of time?

Samuel
02:19
I I won't ask for further details than that because uh I already know because I get your um What's that messages, Dave? But um also you don't know the conditions under which I draft every time. podcast and I'm gonna do that again. Anything to share on that front?

Ash
02:38
Yeah, I mean it's awesome as always. We did just this Thursday gone announce War Dogs, which is a a pretty big um first person shooter for us like a hundred player modern warfare FPS by by a British developer called Bulkhead, a lot more kind of high production values than you probably used to from an indie publisher. So That's exciting. I was checking the wish list numbers this morning and getting kind of foaming at the mouth and I can't say what those numbers were. Because we're a publicly traded company.

Samuel
03:09
Uh but uh just say them and then we'll we'll beep it out.

Dave Scarborough
03:14
That's the same thing.

Samuel
03:16
That's inside of trading, Dave. You can go to prison for a long time for that, mate. So um stay away is my advice. Not if you just beep everything out. Yes, I w I won't be sharing the information.

Ash
03:25
But uh yeah, pretty pretty good. Um you know, it's not it's not a new alien breed. Uh I'm not that excited. But until that point, this'll do.

Matthew
03:34
I like the idea of this podcast being the evidence in Ash's insider trading court case and they have to play that bit about Dave having fingers up his butt and the stenographer just sighs.

Samuel
03:49
Amazing. Well, uh Dave, I'll ask you a more granular how you doing question. Like uh you're bo were you booking a holiday to Japan uh today? Was that a thing that was happening?

Dave Scarborough
03:56
Yeah, I'm looking into going to Japan. Uh shout out to Andy Robinson who's been giving me some sage wisdom on the on the matter. Um but yeah let's go. I think I'd say shout out to Expedia or something like that. Shout out to my travel agent Josh Uh sort of yeah.

Ash
04:10
I can't but has Andy Robinson been to Japan?

Dave Scarborough
04:13
I think he would mention it. Uh yeah, so plan to go next year for a couple of weeks. Uh if my boss is listening I'll put the I'll put the time off requesting uh ASAP. Um so this could be used for both an insider trading trial and a HR related trial. Um now this is uh But yeah, gonna plan to go into Tokyo and then uh sort of travel down to Kyoto, Nasaka and yeah just just spend a couple of weeks. doing all the touristy things. So never been before always wanted to go. And you've been Sam. So and you and you obviously spoke to me in like great detail about how much Disney C sucks. But um you also said there were some good things as well.

Samuel
04:50
Yeah, I mean I'll be curious my friend Lynch listens to this who I stayed with in Japan. He'll have um strong thoughts on whether Disney C uh sucks or not. But it's like got high production values, but not many good rides. Like the Indiana Jones ride is good And then one other good one was closed the day we went, and there was basically nothing else to do that wasn't sort of like kiddie level sort of stuff, and so I just thought I don't know, save a day. Um the Disney parks are all kinda like the same after a certain point. You've been to all the ones in Orlando. I don't know.

Matthew
05:17
Like I I think you could save yourself a day there. Yeah, we we we might we might do that.

Dave Scarborough
05:20
We we're not like there To go to Disney. I would love to go to the Ghibli Museum and I probably will hit up Lynch for some advice on how to get those tickets, because it seems quite a gamble.

Samuel
05:30
It's i I would say don't put too much effort to that. To In the end I just booked one of these like racket travel companies that take you on a bus tour to two places you don't want to go to and then the Gibby Museum. The thing is, it's not really a day's worth of stuff to do there. It's more like a two or three hour kind of like place, I would say. A really nice space to be in, but you can find ways to get there relatively easily if you don't mind being taken to a park in the middle of nowhere that they pretend is of historical importance but clearly isn't and that's what I say happened to me on my um Gibby bus tour.

Matthew
06:01
Uh and I had diarrhea that day, so um I think people I think I already told that story on this podcast.

Samuel
06:05
So um good stuff.

Dave Scarborough
06:06
Um This is the tree that inspired the cat returns, you know, is that kind of stuff. Uh yeah, so anyway. Yeah, looking forward to it. Uh and hopefully not getting diarrhoea. Indeed, yes.

Samuel
06:15
Uh well we'll see about that, won't we? That sounds like a threat. Uh I don't really know. Don't know. And it's nothing I can really do to follow up on that threat either, but um Yes. Matthew, how are you doing? You good?

Matthew
06:24
Yes, g I'm v good, thank you. Very busy it worked. Today's been really busy. I I'm not trying to play the underdog card, but I'm Yeah, I'm not as prepared as I should be.

Samuel
06:34
No, I'm not either really. And uh yes, that this is a hard draft to do, so it's the best levels draft. I've already been yammering on about the categories without actually introducing what we're doing on this episode, but um we have ten categories. We're trying to pick the best levels from different video games and we'll let people in our Discord vote on the winners while you don't have to have your face scanned to be in Discord. That was some bullshit I read today. Uh not looking forward to that. But uh yes, it's it's basically a chance to do something a little bit more granular with the draft, you know, an element of a game as opposed to picking games themselves. Although we'll definitely come back to doing that later in the year, uh for sure. But uh yeah, it's an interesting one because I think it will dial in on the how specific our tastes are with in within certain games, um, but also The categories really just stretch your gaming knowledge to the limits, I think, because obviously there are three other people picking, so you kind of have to come in with backups in each category. And that's actually quite hard for some of these categories, as we'll um we'll get into. So um I did before we get into the actual draft bit, um just a very brief preamble really to tee us up. Matthew, what makes a memorable video game level for you?

Matthew
07:43
I think I did a horrible job of this when we lasted best levels and you asked me this and I sort of stumbled through an answer and then you had a really eloquent breakdown. And you think that would be me cueing up that I've now got a really eloquent answer myself when actually I don't. But I always struggle with this because I've you know, it it really varies from genre to genre and game to game. A great level can be an iconic location that just really captures the imagination. It can have a particular story beat that goes to define it. It could have a specific mechanic. I guess the The thing which connects them all is there is something highly specific about it that lodges in the mind. I think great levels can exist in they can exist in bad games, which is also part of the fun. Like sometimes you know one level can really get it right and sort of show you a what if, you know, this w what this game could have been. And uh yeah, I I mean I saying that I see no through line between any of the things that I uh hope to draft. Which is why this is a difficult question that I'm hoping Dave and Ash have a better answer to.

Samuel
08:49
Bail us out, Dave Scarborough.

Dave Scarborough
08:54
So for me, like when we were talking about doing this draft, my mind immediately went to multiplayer games. I mean I I've spoken before I'm a big sort of competitive shooter player and so map design is sort of figures heavily into what I find interesting when choosing which of those games I want to play or which games I play for long periods of time. Um and so it comes down to replayability and I think similar to what Matthew was saying, like whether it's like an aesthetic choice, whether it's sort of structural one There's something that draws you back in again and again and again that's makes a memorable video game level. If you can just take like one small aspect of a game and find yourself just wanting to go back to it again and again. I think that's special in of itself and that's sort of what sticks out to me of all the times that with all of these games platformers, shooters, racing games, whatever it might be, I've just revisited specific stages again and again and again just to sort of like get a sense of like either the atmosphere or to sort of try and better myself, try to sort of beat times, try to uh beat bosses. Like there's something there's something specific to that that that that Works for me.

Matthew
10:03
Thank you for legitimizing my bad answer by quoting it.

Dave Scarborough
10:06
That's great. I just like adding more bad answer on top of it as well.

Samuel
10:10
Well, I appreciate you. I I do think there's definitely something in the what are the genres that mean something to you and therefore you have, you know, that kind of inbuilt knowledge and that's the angle with which you a attack the draft categories overall, even though obviously they stretch your your knowledge beyond your your sort of comfort zone. It's a bit of a thing of I have to get these things in that are important to me. I guess as is the case in any draft, but you do have to be specific with what you pick as well. You have to be specific in what you describe as your pick. So it is harder, and like you say, it's It's quite helpful to just sort of like bathe in uh you know a bit of footage of the level in question and remind yourself of some of the details to be like, oh yeah, this is why this was magic. So I totally um Get where you're coming from Dave. Ash, what makes a memorable video game level for you?

Ash
10:55
Gosh, well memorable's the word. I think I've really struggled with this draft because I I'm really bad at remembering like the specifics of literally anything. in my life. Like I I just kind of think in broad strokes and and emotional reactions. So the few levels that do really stand out for me like are are the memorable ones. Dave kinda said it. For me it's it's those ones where you return to a game you've played before because there's a level that you really enjoy playing, that you that you want to see again, something that if you experience it more than once, it doesn't just not get boring. It's got something about it that you want to experience again and again. I think I could give some good examples here because um it's just occurred to me we haven't got a shoot 'em up category.

Matthew
11:45
We've got free pick, but none of you are picking shoot-em ups.

Ash
11:47
But I think like shoot 'em ups have got amazing levels in them. Like there's there's that level from our type where you where the the entire level is just like one giant ship that you're like flying above and below and around. Like that That feels like a real kind of set piece wow moment and crucially it's not the first level of the game, so like it the the game like slowly I think th the the context of the level is important as as well. Like it a great level like stands out from the crowd so the game needs to establish some norms, like show you like this is what some regular levels are like And then you do that for a bit and it's like, ah, here's something really special that we can do with all the same ingredients, but it's really cool and you're gonna be like telling your mates about it. That's where I'm leaning, like so something you would replay a game to experience again.

Samuel
12:36
Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think even if it's something that's hyperlinear, replayability, it can just be a matter of for admiring the beats of how scripted a level might be. Or it could just be a case of, you know, you like the sense of place of a of a certain level. Um I totally get that.

Dave Scarborough
12:51
It's it's mechanics as well, to a certain degree. Like I've I think I've gravitated outside of the multiplayer categories to uh levels that do something interesting with the sort of core mechanics or sort of yeah, turn things on their head for the player. So so then it just stands out because it's so differentiated from everything else that's come before or after it. So there's there's that sense to it as well.

Samuel
13:13
Yeah, for sure. Uh Matthew, uh I I was kind of wondering whether the fact that we've done some level related discussions in the past or like boss battle related discussions in the past informed your picks in this draft? Like, did you have to think about it differently so you felt like you were subverting expectations, or is this very much a case of I'm gonna run the old cla the old castle classics this time.

Matthew
13:34
Well I feel like in the last draft it was a total victory for like sincerity. a fashion and that's what people like really resonated with. They d they loved that they were really authentic and he could speak about them with the the passion of a fan. And so You know, I I almost wonder if the era of shenanigans is over and we're now in the the era of Just heartfelt love for things, in which case you will hear uh a few things being um repeated that I've said before.

Dave Scarborough
14:08
I feel like Ash got credit

Ash
14:09
for talking about my games better than I could and then No, I I I I think there's something in the cause I kind of weighed in on everyone's choices and added to them I and I I J because I when I look at like the the spread of games that we all picked, I personally don't think anyone stands out above the other. I do. I think mine did. Well, yeah.

Samuel
14:37
No, I I think it I thought I thought myself and Ash were like head to head in the last one and I think the voting did sort of reflect that even though Ash did trounce me ultimately. But um I also do this, by the way. I also say the same thing back to Sam. I just wanna It's copium, isn't it? It's probably just un uh something undiagnosed that's not been sorted out in my childhood or something.

Dave Scarborough
14:55
It's it's my deep rooted insecurity and I I think that's another aspect that people should consider when uh deciding who who has the best draft picks.

Samuel
15:03
Well, that draft undoubtedly would have been worse without you, Ash, because your knowledge did enhance you know, the picks that we did have on the board and papered over the cracks where myself, Matthew and Dave don't necessarily have as much inbuilt knowledge.

Ash
15:15
16 bit was very much a wheelhouse, so uh Well it'll probably never happen again, so

Dave Scarborough
15:20
Well my ultimate takeaway was you validated my brilliance, so thank you for that.

Matthew
15:25
Yeah. So that Ash can't weigh in on the game, exactly.

Dave Scarborough
15:34
I've only picked games that were released in the last two weeks.

Samuel
15:40
FIFA levels. Oh Fran Park. Oh it's well good Fran Park. Um okay. Let's let's take a quick break then and we'll come back with the draft itself. Welcome back to the podcast, so the categories. Ten uh as usual. Well, actually no, we had nine last time, didn't we? There's no as usual about it really, but ten, which is quite a lot. Uh we did have some back and forth on this, but we decided it last year, locked it in, and then I didn't revisit them until uh basically two days ago and then I was like, oh yeah, maybe this needed a a little bit more surgery than I had time to give it in December. But nonetheless, this is what we've got. So category one is first-person shooter level single player. Category two is first-person shooter level multiplayer. Category three is light gun stage, aka the Ash Day category, Category 4 is multiplayer level, can't be an FPS. Category 5 is platforming level. Category 6 is mission in an open world or larger game. Category 7 is bonus level. Bonus stage I guess. Category eight is boss battle, category nine is worst level and location I'd do my worst enemy to live in. Uh my worst enemy is Day Scarborough, by the way, in case there's any doubt uh for the listeners out there. And category ten is free pick, so any level that you like. So yes, and uh I suppose it's important to point out the rules as well. The kill and steal rules return. Uh a stolen level from a game cannot be killed or stolen again. It's a pretty useful thing to use the old steel token. And yes, killing it just takes it off the board altogether. No one can pick it again. And a really crucial rule is that picking a level from a game takes that entire game off the board, which again it heightens the amount of competition sort of going into it really.

Dave Scarborough
17:48
Could you though take say DK Jungle from Mario Kart 64 and then pick it again for Mario Kart? Wii or whatever one it turned up in later.

Samuel
17:58
I think that maybe the rule there should be you can pick a different level from a different game. But it can't be the same level from a different game.

Dave Scarborough
18:07
Yeah.

Samuel
18:08
I know it's a very granular rule, but I guess we might loosely call that the Mario Kart and Smash Bros rule, just because then I think it's it does it does tap down on shenanigans. Matthew Castle, what do you think of that?

Matthew
18:18
Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think you'd be mad to pick the same to try and attempt to pick the same level, 'cause if two things are too close together in a draft, they tend to cancel each other out and it becomes a bit meaningless. The rule I did wonder about was if you steal, are you stealing the game, or are you stealing the game and the specific level that they picked?

Samuel
18:41
Well this was a suggestion by Wes Fenlon um of PC Gamer. He said, What if you did it so when you steal the game, you can either pick that same level or you can choose a different level from the same game. But obviously I wouldn't put that rule in place without running it past the group. Dave Scarborough, sounded like you had thoughts on this straight away. I don't know. Well, I don't know. What do you think Matthew?

Matthew
19:06
Well the cause well the other question was whether you have to steal it in the same category. Like whether you could s if someone took, say, a single player black ops level, could you steal black ops uh for a multiplayer map? Well you're getting ahead of Dave Scarborough's picks already.

Samuel
19:21
I mean wow.

Matthew
19:22
Um I was picking a theoretical title that I would never ever pick so that no one understood my drafting strategy.

Samuel
19:30
More for you. I think you should have to still in the same category. I feel like that's why we had kill and steal to begin with, was that you were stealing that you were filling that spot and it was meaningful to fill that spot.

Matthew
19:42
Um Ash, how do you feel about the changing the level on a steel?

Ash
19:46
Um I'm quite conflicted. about it, to be honest. And does does that question imply that if Dave picks one Mario Kart level, I can't then pick another level from the same Mario Kart. Yes. Yes.

Samuel
19:59
But you could pick another level from another Mario Kart then.

Ash
20:02
From a different Mario Kart, yeah.

Samuel
20:03
So you could take Baby Park instead, you know?

Ash
20:05
I agree with Dave. I think like I think Keep it simple and and make people commit. Like if you're gonna steal it in you need you need to be sure that you're s you you are stealing that level. Yeah.

Samuel
20:15
Okay. You two feel strongly about this and I'm happy to agree with that. Matthew, you okay are you fine with that? Yeah, I'm absolut I'm absolutely fine with it. Yep. If you steal a level, you are stealing that level from that game. You cannot steal a different level from that game. Um okay, good.

Matthew
20:27
And then we I think we should also say when you're when you are voting on this, you're voting on the level, not the game. Like y someone doesn't have the whole game, they have that level, you know. So that's also important to remember.

Samuel
20:41
Well listeners, I'm not gonna tell you how to vote 'cause I believe in your intelligence and your ability to make it. You would never do that. No, I I no I do agree with you. I think though I I think there's bound to be a mix of like flickers of recognition for a particular level and Well, of it asks a lot from the listener in terms of gaming knowledge to to know a lot of these levels. I mean we had to do a lot of research to remind ourselves of them. But the tip I imagine that most people have like five to six levels that they can pull out of their you know, pull out of thin air if they have to, but you know.

Matthew
21:13
I think the thing I'm getting at is that I don't think you should go, oh well he didn't pick the level I liked, but I like this level from this game, so I'll vote for it, because that's bullshit. You're voting for the level they pick. Okay. You're not voting for the concept of Modern Warfare 1 levels. You're voting for the one modern warfare level.

Samuel
21:34
Yeah, all gillied up. Yeah, okay. Um right, uh well yeah, I again I I just don't for this one, because it's not the games themselves I haven't taken it quite as seriously as some of the other ones in terms of picking. You know what I mean? It just it feels like it's a bit more abstract and a bit more

Matthew
21:52
you know, uh just sort of dealer's choice as opposed to Yeah, I just I'm just saying I just don't think people should be dazzled by the games. They should be dazzled by their levels.

Dave Scarborough
22:00
I'm very curious how much crossover we're gonna have Anyway, versus the other drafts that we've done. This feels like a much more open range for for like our own personal tastes to come out and for them to all be good choices too.

Samuel
22:12
Yeah, I think that's true. I think as well that it's um and it it will be fun when there is crossover because I think there is we we do each have distinctive game tastes but there are some areas in which we will definitely have some crossover. Like I'm I got one eye on platforming level for that. I do think that light gun stage is a Is as mentioned quite a tricky one because there are a finite number of games.

Dave Scarborough
22:34
I've got one pick that no one else will go for, because it's crap, but I love it.

Samuel
22:38
Well that's good. I I assume there's a Ghostbusters light gun shooter that I've got to do. You know what there isn't?

Dave Scarborough
22:41
There's a Luigi's Mansion one though, so I could go all in on that, but I'm not.

Samuel
22:45
I do remember I think when I went to Japan with you, Ash, I think we saw the um Half-Life 2 uh light gun shooter arcade machine that existed.

Ash
22:52
And uh I played it on a on a different trip. I don't know if I'd call it a light gun game, because it does it doesn't use a light gun, it uses

Matthew
23:01
Twi twin joysticks and pedals.

Ash
23:04
It's like getting into a a mech suit uh when you play it. It's tr it's truly wild, especially as it just it's not like It's not like an adaptation of the game, it is just Half-Life 2 in an arcade machine. Uh last a game that you force yourself into.

Samuel
23:18
A game that asks the question, what if Gordon Freeman was a car, finally, and someone someone made that happen Of the G Man was a bike. So uh isn't that just Gary's mod? Uh so I guess Let's talk a bit about those categories then. Dave, what do you sort of make of them more generally?

Dave Scarborough
23:36
I actually kinda loved that there's so much here for my personal taste in multiplayer and multiplayer shooters. So there was just like an abundance of choices in those. I think more broadly across the other missions, I have like Dark Souls in about six categories that I could pick it in because like there are certain games, Dark Souls being one of them, and there's a few games like this, where it has so many iconic moments here and there that it really is like a a a feast in terms of, you know, what sort of you know, w w whether it's boss battles, bonus levels, whether it's just like a a specific area. Like there's just so much to to en Does Dark Souls have a bonus level?

Samuel
24:15
Do you count the painted world as a bonus level, Dave? Maybe. Uh see I is that a is that a bonus level though? Does that count as a bonus stage? Ash have you played Dark Souls? Do you think that counts as a bonus stage?

Ash
24:28
I'm not sure anything in Dark Souls can really count as a bonus stage. So it's w it's one contiguous world, right?

Matthew
24:33
Uh th w I mean there is that room where you have to collect as many pineapples as you can in sixty seconds. That's a bonus stage.

Dave Scarborough
24:40
Yeah, it's monkey target. Like if we all forgot it.

Matthew
24:43
Oh wait, yeah, that's not Dark Souls.

Ash
24:45
Ah, well, right, hang on. So on the topic of Monkey Target. Right. I'm g I'm guessing we're not including bonus modes.

Samuel
24:57
It's probably good to set these parameters, isn't it? Because I did think about this too. I did think that as well. target. That's a mode. Yeah it is a mode and I think that a bonus stage is a much more specific thing that happens, occurs within the course of playing the game. That is a notable departure from the core mechanics of the game.

Ash
25:16
And Monkey Target does have three different levels that you cycle between, so you could pick a level from Monkey Target, but I think that'd be insane.

Matthew
25:25
You don't play like five stages of regular monkey ball and then it gives you a random game of monkey target.

Samuel
25:30
No, that doesn't happen. But also you could pick that in multiplayer, can't be an FPS, that's fine. Yeah. That's exactly what that category is for, really. It's for your kind of party level sort of like nonsense really. Um but yeah, I mean it's an interesting question. I don't think I would allow the painted world because I think it is clearly part of the experience if it's more like a side quest zone. But just because inside a painting, Dave, that doesn't make it a bonus stage. You know what I mean? It's I get where you're coming from with it.

Dave Scarborough
26:00
I I think it's more the fact the fact that it it's not part of the main Storyline. It's not part of the main sort of linear narrative of it, or well, linear as as far as Stark Souls is. Um, and you just kind of it's one of those things you kind of have to know about. to f to find, to get, to unlock, to access. And so it feels like a bonus in that sense. It's not DLC or anything. It's just a part of the world that's sort of hidden away for for those that know.

Ash
26:22
I mean there there is a category for this thing.

Dave Scarborough
26:25
Yeah, I know. World level uh no, uh mission and open world. Large game. Yeah. It's fine. It's not my it's not my number one choice, so it's all good. Okay. Now fair enough.

Samuel
26:34
Um I'm gonna go take my toys home. I'm done. Um Ash what do you think of the categories?

Ash
26:40
I deeply deeply regret suggesting light gun game level. I completely screwed us all with that. We're committed to it now and I do I I have I have a contentious pick. Um so I'd be um we can discuss that when we come to it. And do you know what? I really struggled on platforming level. Um, which surprised me because I do love platform games, but when I think of like the platform games that I love, it they all kind of I think about them quite holistically and I think about them in terms of mechanics and aesthetic and how it makes me feel. I don't necessarily think of one single level. It's easier to think of 3D levels than it was 2D. Um so I don't know if that was simple.

Dave Scarborough
27:25
I thought the same as well. Yeah. I f I've more modern platformers which going back to what I was saying before about what makes standout uh great levels is um Stuff that that mucks around with the sort of established mechanics and and and does some really inventive things with them. Um which is more common to the 3D stuff than it is obviously the two D era.

Samuel
27:45
Yeah, it's an interesting test of you know, what you think will be more distinctive to the voters as well, I think, because there are some levels that are just completely immortal, and then there are some levels that are more intricate masterpieces that are maybe not talked about as much because You know, for whatever reason, maybe when you were a kid you played one level over and over and over again, but as an adult you might have appreciated one, let's say Mario Galaxy 2 level once and then not thought about it again. Um but if you pick like Green Hill Zone then people might be like, oh yeah, I I like Green Hill Zone. Um so That's the other thing.

Dave Scarborough
28:15
I think so many platforming like that that era, it's it's like the first two stages that are most iconic as well, which also makes it feel like a bit of a vanilla choice.

Ash
28:23
You know, like World One One. There's a couple of reasons for that, isn't there? Wa one is they're the stages we've all played again and again, because it's the first stage. And then the other one that we that we all learned from the book that came with Mario Maker is Oh yeah of course good good game developers design the first level last once they've figured out like what makes the game good. So the first level should always be The best in theory.

Samuel
28:48
Yes, uh and all the reverse happens with Metroid Prime where the best level is first and then the other levels are a bit like, eh. But the uh that Chozo Village level is like clearly the what Metro Prime is supposed to be, um, not to relitigate an old um saw point, Matthew. I was curious, Matthew, what you made of the categories and whether you think voters will Favour picks from older games where they have more of a reputation versus newer games where the maps are objectively prettier or more interesting. Uh no offense, caverns and goldeneye.

Matthew
29:17
I think there are some places which are so iconic and so associated with their genre, particularly in like multiplayer games where I haven't played, you know, an online shooter. in years, you know, maybe ten years or something, but I you know, I still have a fondness for for for those original maps and I I think from you know doing a little bit of research and seeing how different communities talked about their favorite maps or their favourite levels in in their chosen series that That's true of a lot of people. I think this is some words you hear and you're like, oh yeah, that is a good level. You just you know it in your bones what a good classic level is And by classic I don't mean it doesn't have to be super super old, but no, I'm feeling okay.

Samuel
30:03
Well, I think we should um get into the draft from here because we've got 40 picks and that's gonna take a long time. And who knows what technical disasters might occur along the way. So get going now. Already had one. Um so Matthew, it's time to do the old spinner and decide who wins. Who wins? Who gives who gives us first, not winner.

Matthew
30:21
Going first is Samuel. Oh shit. That's good. That's good news. Go going second. The wheel goes round and round, but where does it stop? It's Ashley Day Going third The cursed third spot. It's looks like it's gonna be It's Dave.

Dave Scarborough
30:51
Oof.

Samuel
30:55
It is, yeah.

Matthew
30:56
Which means I am fourth.

Samuel
30:57
Okay. Alright then. Um both on the turn. Okay, so over. Uh God, do I just get the hardest category out of the way first so I don't have to worry about I'm just to be frank, Matthew picking Ghost Squad before I do. Um Or do I just pick one that I know? It's like I I think there's like two. I th to me there's like two that's not two. There's way more than two, Dave. There's like there's two everyone wants. I swear there's just two there's everyone wants I don't know if I want any of them. I think I'm going to just go with category 8 boss battle and take the end from Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater. Which it's probably I mean it'll probably get stolen to be honest or killed because it's a very good pick, but this is not the only thing I have for this category. I have like two other picks I really like, but um it is a that mix of great game, memorable boss, considered one of the all-time great bosses from a series renowned for great bosses. Fight an old man in the jungle if you're really shit at it, like Chris McMahon on Games TM was, you just um move your clock forward till he dies in um So you don't have to actually fight him. Um he can take you hostage, put you in prison. I mean it's a moment we talked about many tim a a part of the game we talked about many times in this podcast, but it is an all-time classic. And boss battle does feel like one of those categories where like if you get the right pick it might be um it might be a winner. So um There it is. And uh Dave, is this one of the two that you thought was gonna be in the mix?

Dave Scarborough
32:32
I know we talked about this yesterday. It is it yeah, it's it is one of them, for sure. It's it's so iconic and I think it's it's that sweet spot for us for us uh elder millennials uh in terms of our tastes and sort of influence.

Samuel
32:47
So uh Ashley Day, um what do you think of this pick?

Ash
32:50
This is one of the one of the best bits from one of the best games ever made. Uh so yeah, utterly delighted by it. I do I do think if you I I like your thinking, Sam, like like going to Metal Gear for boss battles is is a really good idea because there's so many of them. And I've just been sitting here thinking, is there a better boss battle? And the Metal Gear games. There's one other one that you could argue.

Matthew
33:14
Yeah, the slight the sniper battle with quiet better than this.

Samuel
33:17
I actually really like that. You'd call it a box to land on her head and bonk her on the head and then she's like uh that's the end of the boss power. That's pretty good. But it's uh yeah. I know I know which one day you're thinking of. I I don't think it's as good as the end, but um Yeah, I f I think it's in the conversation at least. It's certainly memorable. Yeah. But yes, okay. Well that's my pick then. Bring on the pain. Ashley Day, what's your first pick?

Ash
33:40
Alright, so I'm gonna go for what I think is gonna be the most competitive category first. I'm scared of Dave in a couple of categories. uh which is the first time I've ever said this in one of the drafts. I'm gonna go for FPS single player level and we're gonna go Into the Abyss from Titanfall 2.

Samuel
34:00
Oh shit, that was actually on my list for sure. That was that's a great pick.

Ash
34:04
Right? Uh so yeah, for for anyone who doesn't know that this this is the level that is set inside a factory that builds houses and you are like having to run and leap around. It's almost like a platform game level really. You're like leaping around. inside this giant machine as it like turns big flat pieces of house around, flips them about, and it and it's It's almost like a like a Mario Galaxy level in in a way in that the the landscape is completely constantly like shifting and changing around you and Uh and of course you you know there's a lot of shooting that goes on, so you've got to consider um all the angles of of attack and defence in this ever shifting landscape. It's just It's it's like a mind-blowing and really satisfying moment at the end of a of a very, very satisfying game that I think still Still not enough people have played Titanfall 2. It's one of those games where people are like, you've got to play Titanfall 2. But we're not, as Matthew said, we're not voting for the game. I want everyone to forget that this is one of the best games every time.

Matthew
35:13
No, it has this is the thing.

Dave Scarborough
35:14
I uh this was annoying because this was top of my list, but it was effect and cause was my top. It was between

Matthew
35:20
Those two stages.

Dave Scarborough
35:21
Effect and cause is an incredible stage, which I would say is marginally better. Um, which is the one where you time jump, you pick up like a time travel device and you can press it and it takes you back in time into the stage and it allows you to sort of navigate different traversal puzzles and sort of like have firefights in two different like time periods. It's just an incredible level. And it that's the great thing about Titanfall too is that it has like this sort of escalating sense of like ingenuity when it comes to uh its level design. And I think like the most interesting stuff is the stuff outside of the giant robot, you know, like level Both these two levels at a standout but don't evolve the robot really at all. So um I'm actually really annoyed you've picked this.

Samuel
36:03
My guy my guy BT catching strays. That's tough.

Dave Scarborough
36:06
Um it's uh I actually disagree with you, Dave.

Samuel
36:09
I think affecting cause is a novel level, but I think that this is a superior level in terms of Titanfalls like base mechanics. I mean, this is where I think you see the game jam style approach they took to building the campaign of Titanfall 2 where they were like, let's just workshop loads of ideas for single player levels. Like this is where you see that DNA, but like the the kind of amazing end result of doing that. And it also just makes you miss um the a world where we had more single player first person shooters every year than we do. It was down to like one or two a year now. So yeah.

Dave Scarborough
36:39
It was one of the like the lo It was like the most n Valve non-valve game. Like these these levels were just like this barrage of inventive first-rate ideas. And it's yeah, like the ingenuity of it is just incredible. Again, I'm annoyed.

Samuel
36:53
Good stuff. Well Dave, um your revenge begins now. Um what would you like to pick first?

Dave Scarborough
36:58
Uh I'm gonna go with platforming level and I'm gonna go with Mario Galaxy and I'm gonna go with the freeze frame level. This one's obviously clearly inspired to some degree visually at least, or like in terms of the atmosphere it's trying to evoke from Cool Cool World in Mario 64. But going back to again to what I was saying at the beginning, this does that really great cool, super exciting thing where it gives you a game mechanic and it does really interesting things with it. Um you turn into an ice mario, you can freeze the water and then there's the you know fountains to progress through the map and then uh through the level should I say, and then as it later on, like when the when the world is sort of covered in lava, again you can use the power up to sort of create little ice patches across the lava to sort of get cross and and and get to uh and get to the end. Like it's just it it's sort of visually like stunning. It's got great, exciting, inventive gameplay design And I think it's probably one of the standout levels of Marriott Galaxy. I'm sure it's again probably very controversial. There's probably a whole bunch of levels that that other people have got in their mind, but for me this was the one that jumped out.

Samuel
38:03
I think it's a cool level, were it not for the fact that the conquering the summit bit of this level is like being punched in the dick repeatedly. Um because you're climbing it while like um these big snowballs are knocking you off. I'm pretty sure that's part of um A free swing, obviously. But um yeah.

Matthew
38:25
It's not my favourite galaxy, Mario Galaxy, so it's a bit of a bum that that's now the Mario Galaxy level that's in play in this draft. You know, I love my little bit of uh boy bass, Bowser's dark matter reactor with all the flipping gravity. Um I probably would have gone with yeah, something that played a little bit more with gravity. Freeze flame also has quite a bit of like. Ice and Fire Mario, which are are not the the best bit of Mario Galaxy, but does have ice skating on a giant ice donut, which is amazing. So is him. Yeah, it's a g it's a good it is a good pick.

Samuel
39:00
Yeah, it's a good game to get off the board early, I think. Ash, what do you make of this as the the Mario Galaxy pick that we are now stuck with? Well good or bad.

Ash
39:07
I'm kind of aligned with Matthew really and I I think i in that this isn't the Mario Galaxy level I would have necessarily gone for, but I think that's a reflection of just how many great levels there are in in Mario Galaxy and other Mario games. It's just like there's two like how do you pick the best level from a game like Mario Galaxy? Dave's done it. He's very brave. Um I'm not sure it's a winning choice though, Dave. I'm very sorry.

Samuel
39:32
Well, who's to say? Who's to say? Dave, if you pick all the worst levels for the best games, that might actually be a great strategy.

Dave Scarborough
39:43
narrative I'm trying to pedal here, right? I stand by affecting cause is a better map, but you know, here we are.

Samuel
39:49
No, Affecting Cause is cool, but anyway. Matthew, you have two picks now. For bonus stage or bonus level, I'm gonna go with the car stage from Street Fighter 2.

Matthew
40:00
Oh, goddammit. Very good. In which you punch a car uh to pieces in sixty seconds. I don't have any great deep thoughts on this other than as a kid who wasn't really playing a lot of Street Fighter It's an image that instantly catches your imagination when you see it in a magazine or you m like my older cousins were big into Street Fighter and they had this and when you were a child it's there seems some something quite transgressive and exciting about the idea of just a burly muscle man or muscle woman kicking the shit out of a whatever it is, some kind of saloon car. You're just like, well that looks fun. Like that if if anything, I'm more interested in that than I am uh fighting these other characters and doing all these complicated moves. So just for the childish excitement, the rebellious thrill of committing some sort of vandalism against the vehicle, uh yeah, the car stage.

Samuel
40:54
I think and I think it's like a definitive bonus stage also. Is it's probably the most iconic bonus stage and the one that is like

Ash
41:06
I feel like whenever there's a meme about Street Fighter or some Um some big global company does like a marketing crossover with Street Fighter. It's always this bit that is used Because it it's it's so iconic and and and that is weird because as Samuel says, uh as Matthew says, sorry, like it's not the bit of Street Fighter that everyone that has like made Street Fighter um stand the test of time. Um but yeah ev everyone loves it.

Matthew
41:33
If fighting game tournaments were how fast could you destroy that car, I'd I would watch that.

Samuel
41:39
Okay, well that's um I think that's a a strong first pick Matthew. So what's your next pick?

Matthew
41:43
Oh shit, I've got a pick again, I forgot. That's a good thing, pal. That's a good thing. I almost don't want to get worse level out of the way, because I feel like there's a lot of comedy in in that. That's like save that for the end for a kind of laugh sort of thing. Yeah, like just a little kind of pit me up at the 'cause you want to end strong just so that people are confident in voting for me.

Dave Scarborough
42:00
But is that category me and Ash were talking about this?

Ash
42:03
Is that the worst level to play, like a bad level, or is it Does it have to be objectively a bad level or just a level that thematically you wouldn't want to spend time in?

Samuel
42:13
I I think ideally both. Like it's to be honest, I picked it because I thought the library in Halo would be the one that people would pick for that, because famously not a good level, and if you were stuck there, it would be a bad time. But I will hear you out on level that is objectively good, but also the location is like, fuck this, I never wanna ever go here again.

Dave Scarborough
42:34
Like that would be a punishment fitting for your many crimes.

Samuel
42:41
That's you'd hate to be stuck in hotel dusk, but I'm not gonna pick Hotel Dusk. No, I mean I wouldn't mind like staying there. I just don't want to talk to anyone there, Matthew. That's my That's my gripe with Hotel Dusk.

Matthew
42:53
I like the idea of playing Hotel Dusk, but you are also now a character in that hotel born in that style.

Samuel
42:59
I'm trap I'm trapped in your DS cart forever. That's where I live now. That's not good. What's your next pick, Matthew?

Matthew
43:05
I'm gonna go for another broad, iconic classic. I'm gonna take facility from Goldeneye for first-person shooter level multiplayer.

Ash
43:14
My god, you're taking all of my picks?

Matthew
43:16
You may steal you can steal them. They're there. Or kill them. That's an option. Yeah, I I will say last time I felt I was a little bit too timid around the big picks because of the stealing that went on in the previous draft. um absolutely destroyed me. So I I but I think I went too far the other way. So let's let's see if this works out.

Samuel
43:36
That's Matthew saying I I deliberately tanked my own draft and uh so I wouldn't win, um giving people other people the chance to win instead. I feel like that was the

Matthew
43:44
'Cause I'm a good guy and I think you should reward this good guy this time. We we played this recently and it's a it's a really simple map. I think on paper it's It's like technically not a great multiplayer map in that it's like one loop and then a few weird dead ends that you can get stuck in and you know you have to kind of opt to basically leave the interesting loop where anything can happen. to go into those rooms with the two tanks. But I think there is something about how familiar this level is to you. You know, everyone who's played Goldeneye single player loads really knows this this space inside out. So everyone comes into it with like an idea of what they're meant to do. It's one of the more kind of iconic moments from the film and that or that ties into the excitement of playing it. It's fundamentally just a space I spent you know, I didn't spend hundreds of hours just here, but I pr you know, I spent comfortably tens of hours running loops of here, killing people in every possible variation of ways that you can kill people in facility. When you think multiplayer, you maybe think Goldeneye. And if you think Goldeneye, you definitely think facility. So I think it's a pretty safe pick on those grounds.

Samuel
44:54
Yeah, I mean, as someone who Along with your wife trapped you in facility um with uh with proximity mines. Or was it remote mines? I can't remember. Proximity mines, wasn't it?

Matthew
45:03
It was proximity mines under the air vent, so I basically couldn't leave.

Samuel
45:08
So you were just trapped um between my science rooms and your wife's um toilets basically. And um it was a great time for Um for anyone who wasn't Matthew Castle that evening. Very funny. The best of times and the worst of times. Ash, you were gonna pick this. You think this is the pick for this category?

Ash
45:24
Well mm, uh so I had this on my list for single player Um specifically. Um I really love the the op this is the one where you start off in the air vents above above the toilets, right? And then you

Matthew
45:35
Yeah.

Ash
45:36
Sneak behind the guards who you you know, in your like head cannon they're having a wee while you like pop them in the head. And they're actually standing fully dressed in the cubicle, very still. They're thinking about it. So I love it as a single player level. Um But as I think as GoldenEye's now completely gone from the board, I I believe that's the rule, Complex is the one I was thinking of for uh multiplier.

Matthew
45:58
Um but I um I yeah w I won't drone on about why, that's that's for another time.

Ash
46:03
But uh I think I was I was fifteen when Goldeneye came out, um and we we spent you know, me and my mates We probably did spend hundreds of hours playing Goldeneye and these maps like really, really held up to that level of scrutiny like we we were playing. for months, just just a small handful of kids. Um so I I yeah, I like I doff my ha cap to this choice. It's um it's a good and it is good.

Samuel
46:31
I think that's I think I'd probably s agree with you, Ash, that Facility is a better single player map relative to the other maps than facility as to the multiplayer maps in this game. Like I think it is a good map. Uh I think Math what Matthew points out about it having dead ends and that being sort of something you wouldn't put in an FPS now is true. Um but i it's sort of like you can't deny it's the most distinctive location in Goldeneye, you know, you just that the opening to that film is so memorable. It's the one that that

Dave Scarborough
46:58
is the most one-to-one recreation of the film. So it's it it then it just adds that additional sort of like nostalgia factor to it.

Samuel
47:05
Definitely. Yeah. It's much better than that. terrible fucking park one. What was it called again? Um statue that I w Yeah, oh god. It was that was tough watching you play that again. It just being like This is the worst the worst.

Matthew
47:18
Trying to work out which shipping container had Robbie Coltrane in it.

Samuel
47:25
RIP. Uh okay, so Dave, what's your next pick?

Dave Scarborough
47:29
I am gonna go before it gets taken. I think I could go in boss battle. I'm gonna go with um Dark Souls and S'all and Ornstein. Again, this this may be one of those picks where everyone goes, you pick the the worst boss battle from from the game. Uh I should have done Lord of Cinder, whatever. But this this one's so iconic. I spent I totted it up afterwards. I think I spent over 30 hours. Just trying to beat S'more and Audstein, which is like why don't you just stop playing?

Samuel
48:00
Couldn't that's a waste of your life, mate. You could have played Final Fantasy Eight in that.

Dave Scarborough
48:04
Fifteen hours of that is walking from the last bonfire across that fucking rickety not even rickety, that that sort of like narrow bridge over to the to the temple where they're where they're in. just absolute grueling, punishing like uh uh uh journey towards that that boss battle each time. But the the the design of both of them to sort of um uh well they're they're sort of in this gold armor, one of s you know, tall and thin, one just like large and chunky. Um you can take him out in either order and then the other one sort of like uh levels up after that time and unlocks different moves, become more aggressive. uh building out strategies, different like try trying it with different like player builds. It it it is f in my mind, the most intense uh boss battle I've I've ever encountered and obviously like the the gratification and the the reward of finally defeating them was was uh Unlike any other boss battle that I that I played before. And yes, I spent too many hours attempting it. And I will say some of that is I went off and I leveled up and then I came back again. but that was a blocker for 30 hours of my game time in the first Dark Souls. And Analondo in general anyway is just one of the most beautiful and sort of haunting game locations uh in in any game that I've ever played. And obviously Dark Souls really made its mark in terms of its um atmosphere, world design and s and and the lore and and sort of that really haunting and isolating um sort of vibe that you get from exploring that world and like this this sort of abandoned ornate city at the center of it is just so striking and just has left like a lasting imprint in my mind. And this this boss battle, sort of the cherry on top of that.

Samuel
49:48
Yeah, I mean I guess every game by, you know, that studio has a skill check boss, right? And yeah. It's like uh if you can do this, you can finish the game. And that's on Stein and Smell in this game. Uh would it be Vicar Amelia in Bloodborne? I don't really know.

Matthew
50:03
Or like uh maybe it'd be uh one of the ones deeper into it, or like um Bloodborne is definitely Father Gascoigne, everyone agrees.

Samuel
50:11
Or Ginechi Roshno. in um Sakura on top of that tower. Like it's these are like the mo the moments where yeah it's either kind of like you know keep going or just uninstall the game and get on with your life. And I admire your stamina for doing it. I mean I recommend getting someone else to just batter um one of them for you. That's what I did. PC Gamers West Fenlin just bailed me out of this. So I've technically done this, but not really.

Dave Scarborough
50:32
Yeah and I soloed it. Actually the first three Dark Souls and it's only been three, but the first the the three Dark Souls games I I I soloed completely whereas I had kids and then I did bit more co-op when it came to uh uh Elden Ring and uh

Samuel
50:49
It is a it is a cool boss. I like how in uh like part two of the boss battle there's a cutscene and one absorbs the power of the other and becomes like a gigantic version of himself. I That's got big uh two giant men energy, so I like that, obviously.

Matthew
51:03
Um saying if if someone kills one of us, the other one's gonna consume them and become an even better podcast.

Samuel
51:09
Yes, exactly Matthew. It might be curse, but the end result will be great for whoever's left. Ash, I'm guessing you have some thoughts on this. Do you think it's a good pick for Dark Souls?

Ash
51:18
Kinda like Metal Gear, like the Dark Souls series and like specifically Dark Souls 1, like is like littered with amazing boss battles. I think you could have legitimately picked a few of them. But you know, if like Dave you were gonna ask ChatGPT what's the best boss battle from Dark Souls, like this is the one, I suppose.

Dave Scarborough
51:39
You haven't even beaten it.

Ash
51:42
I I know you love this game.

Dave Scarborough
51:44
I know. You haven't even beaten this boss.

Ash
51:46
You're just gonna have to kill yourself, Dave. Kill yourself, Dave.

Dave Scarborough
51:49
And I had to help you get through half of Dark Souls as well, Savs. You can fuck off. Did you? Yeah. Walking through Blight Town.

Samuel
51:57
I don't remember that happening. Or maybe was that a replay? Was that a Switch replay? I don't think we ever played this game together. Are you thinking of someone else? Oh, it might be. You're not a very memorable man to be fair. You've got me confused with another imagined staff writer.

Dave Scarborough
52:11
I'm pretty sure we play I helped you out on some of this, but I might be wrong. I might be wrong.

Samuel
52:16
We've never played this game together. I that's never happened. I promise you it's never I've only ever played it with Wes, who's very patient with me while I mig I do nothing, contribute nothing while he finishes the entire game. So that's actually pretty likely. We often talk about playing a game but never do it. We did um Rocket League that one time. Yeah. But oh yeah, Arc Raders. No, we'll do Arc Raters at some point, pal. It'll happen. Don't worry. Um, I take that back, or I stand by my point that Ash can get fucked. I stand by that you should kill yourself. That's just I just stand by that. I nearly did obviously 30 hours of trying to beat these guys. Obviously I'm only joking. Um okay, Ash, what's your next pick?

Ash
52:52
Okay, so as Matthew took one of my two picks for bonus level, I'm gonna have to hone in on that and I'm gonna go the um half pie p uh bonus level from Sonic the Hedgehog Two.

Samuel
53:04
But it's not even good!

Ash
53:06
It's tremendous.

Samuel
53:08
Is it? Are we sure it's good?

Ash
53:10
Look, just imagine you are ten-year-old Ashley Day in 1992 Christ. You've got to remember, right? Every single game in nineteen ninety-two, this is what you did. You started at the left hand side of the screen. And you went to the right hand side of the screen. That was all games. And then suddenly you're going into the screen. This was before Doom. You're going into the screen. at breakneck speed. Like it was it was honestly mind blowing. And like I realize it sounds very facetious when I say that and I can't hang my entire argument on like this was this was amazing for the time. But I will go back to Sonic 2 quite often. Just to play the half-pipe stage. I still get a little bit giddy when this bonus stage comes up. It's just good fun. I like running over the edge of the half pipe and kind of like spinning through the air and coming back down again. I like the little delay on tails. following you, like the um the Pavlovian response of just like collecting the rings as as you go through it. Like it's just it's just good fun. This this is an iconic bonus level and I won't hear any differently

Samuel
54:19
Well shit, that's I can't believe that's where Sonic 2 went in this draft. Like all the levels you could have picked for platforming level just wasted on these bonus stages that are basically unplayable after the first one. Unbelievable. Okay. Uh well you know what? That's uh that's fine.

Ash
54:36
Um spend on the Sonic one bonus stage

Samuel
54:38
Uh I don't think it is, first of all. Oh my goodness. Oh my god. Brian, we can actually do that one. This one is just so hard. The amount of bombs they're throwing your way on that second one onwards is just like I don't know, requires a ridiculous amount of patience.

Ash
54:53
Okay, so I s I'm specifically saying the first half pipe bonus stage is my pick.

Samuel
54:59
Alright, well um, something free rounds are better though, right?

Dave Scarborough
55:02
I mean I suppose someone could still pick one of those.

Samuel
55:04
What blue sphere? Yeah, I like this. Oh my god. Well, I mean they're probably all gonna come up at some point in this draft, so um yeah, it's just it turns out the bonus levels there aren't that many of them. Look and uh we doomed ourselves with that category.

Ash
55:17
I am banking on your podcast having a lot of secret Sonic fans in it, alright.

Samuel
55:22
I think it does to be honest. No, they're not secret. They've got no shame. M much to Matthew's chagrin, they're not uh secret, no. Alright then, it comes back to me for two picks. So I think the hardest one That like if I don't get something, I'll be a pain in the dick will be mission in an open world or larger game, category six. So I'm going to be taking the big score in Grand Theft Autor 5, aka the final heist in the game. where you're raiding going to a bank in downtown Los Santos. There are two ways you can do it. A quiet way where you kind of sneak in and another way where you basically just get a big digger and smash through the foundations of the building um to get into this vault and then ends with like a multi-vehicle chase with Michael and uh Franklin just like Fighting guys like Robert De Niro and Heat in the streets of Los Santos, like helicopters getting the hell out of there. It's basically everything, all the promise of the game being like we're the heist GTA. kind of coming together. I watched a bunch of it while I was eating my de what eating my nachos before this podcast and I was like, I think that's the one where you're like, it's the best heist in the game that's about heists, therefore it's gotta be the right pick for For the GTA series. Yeah, so uh Dave, do you remember this one? Did you finish GTA Five?

Dave Scarborough
56:34
It was also top of my list on this category. So uh Yeah, yeah, it's amazing. It's like that that that's fucking do heat. You know, rock star just love to make these pastiche of like iconic moments in cinema and this is this is their this is their Michael Mann. uh riff. Uh it's fantastic. As you say, like there's different approaches to it, but it's all bombastic, it's all just uh explosive and like escalates like in uh incredibly exciting ways. This is like the promise of what GTA It this is like you know, that that memory of what you felt like GTA free was when you were growing up. Like this is actually, you know, what it is in modern gaming terms, and it's just like really like full blooded and exciting and action-packed and yeah it's it's it's great. I love I love driving that digger around smashing smashing through shit. Like that's so much fun.

Samuel
57:24
Yeah, yeah, it's uh it's I think it just is the the part that even though it's been twelve years since I finished this game, it's still wedged in my memory as like a you know, like a an amazing thing they pulled off in terms of scripted moments, but Giving you the sort of like, you know, a little bit of freedom in how you plan it. It's just, yeah, everything that GTA V does so well.

Dave Scarborough
57:42
It's it's almost just slightly Saints Roe-ish. You know, it it just has like a slight Tinge of that of that abs of absurdity. That's just weird. I'm just so fucking dating.

Ash
57:53
Are you sabotaging his pictures?

Dave Scarborough
57:55
I'm just saying, it is it is a little it is a little sanctuary.

Ash
57:59
It's a little bit like this not very good game.

Dave Scarborough
58:06
But you know, you could see I I wouldn't go as far as say they were influenced by it, but I I wouldn't say I I think this put brought those two franchises closer together.

Matthew
58:14
It's a little bit like the half pipe from Sonic 2.

Samuel
58:20
Oh good stuff. Uh so yes that's the big score in GTA five. That's the screen.

Matthew
58:24
That is great. I think that also kills off basically picking any mission from GTA four. 'Cause there's nothing as good as that in there.

Samuel
58:31
U Uh yes, it is uh it is a nice pick. I have like I have like a a pretty a more obscure one if this was taken off the board, but uh I think it's uh it's uh Yeah, the arguably the best open world game and the best mission in that game. Um okay so I have one more pick which is going to be two scarabs, repeat, two scarabs. Um it's the covenant from Halo 3. AK the level with the two scarabs. I think basically the the mission that it has every single thing that Halo does well in it, like big open environments, fighting alien lads with a a power axe, and then when you reach the end uh sort of set piece where it's these two giant walkers that drop down from the sky. It's your pick of how you do it. Do you jump in an aircraft and blow 'em up from uh from behind? Do you go on foot, get in one of those um pathetic little jeeps, go off a ramp and land it on top of one of the mechs and then Have Master Chief just punch the back of it himself while taking out enemies going across it, or do you just do some combination of them and just sort of like take out the legs one at a time and then blow it up when it crumples to the ground and w and it's sort of like uh malfunctioning and that's your moment to blow it up. It's just one of those set pieces you can repeat over and over again. And um I love this mission. I'm very well documented with how much I love this. Halo does have a bunch of good missions and it's a great series for um for these categories I would say, but Halo 3 is uh great FPS, but this is like far and away the best level in that game. Do any of you have much of a relationship with this level? Can any of you comment on it?

Matthew
01:00:34
It's it's stopped me from picking Cortana as the worst level and location I'd do my worst enemy to live in, which of course is the level which is like an asshole.

Samuel
01:00:44
Yeah, um fair enough. But yeah, I I guess this is more of a big Sammy pick, but I feel like if you've played Halo 3, then it's it's great stuff. So I refer to myself as Big Sammy in third person there. I promise I'll never do that again. Um okay, are we come back to Ash.

Ash
01:00:58
How many Sonic games can I get away with picking? All of the bonus stages from all of them.

Samuel
01:01:06
That'd be a bold free pick. Free picking Blue Sphere from Sonic 3 would be really something.

Ash
01:01:11
Right, I'm gonna I'm gonna get this I'm gonna get this out of the way 'cause I'm slightly concerned you won't allow it, but I think you will. Mission in an open world or larger game I'm gonna go with the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask. And it's the Cafe and Anju quest. Do I need to explain what this is?

Samuel
01:01:30
It might be good to give the listers an overview of what this is. Yes.

Ash
01:01:33
Yeah. Do I need to explain it so that you can weigh in on whether it's allowed or not?

Matthew
01:01:37
I think that's okay. I think quests in RPGs is fine for this.

Samuel
01:01:41
Yeah, I think so. I think it's too limiting without it, because if you don't have it

Ash
01:01:44
You can't pick anything from like And I don't play open world games.

Samuel
01:01:47
Well that's it. You can't pick anything from like Skyrim if you don't have quests, you know.

Ash
01:01:50
Okay, so Majora's Mask as as I'm sure most people know, there are three days until a giant grinning moon. hits the world of Termina and destroys it. And Link uses his time traveling powers from Ocarina of Time to interfere with with the world. and uh prevent this catastrophe from happening. Along the way, he discovers these two characters, Cafe and Anju. who are uh a kind of boyfriend and girlfriend, but I think it's the the boyfriend has um he's been turned into a child uh and he's running around in a mask And the girlfriend is like where where is he? With like the cat kinda lost and you and you can spend it ta it takes the whole three day period that you play in in this like groundhog day style world to reunite this couple and get them back together. So you ha you have to memorize like where they are, what they need on specific days, um, you know, just like Bill Murray and Groundhog Day, you've you've got to like master time and space in order to reunite. uh this couple and get them back together and if you do all of that correctly you will reunite them just before the moon hits the earth and destroys everything anyway. Like it is it's utterly brutal. There it there is a happy ending like eventually when you beat the game and stop the disaster from happening you get to see this couple get married. But there's there's a kind of like bittersweet beauty to this quest of like the the sheer effort you go into to reuniting this couple when they're um doomed anyway. Um Apparently the Zelda team came up with this when they um in real life they attended a wedding that was taking place near a nuclear testing facility. Which is that's that's totally mad, that behind the scenes story. And it like it it got them thinking about like the kind of mix of futility and hope like intertwined in that event and they wanted to capture that. i in in a video game and and like s uh especially at the time and I would argue like quite a lot since like no one has ever really done that in in a game, like ca captured that that sense that you want to you want to do the right thing by these people even though you know it's pointless. I think that's a really beautiful thing. So

Samuel
01:04:10
That's my pick. Wow. I mean that's great. I'm really glad I got you to lay that out 'cause that's uh that's awesome. I mean I I've not played this game, but yeah.

Matthew
01:04:16
Sound the alarm, Ash is being interesting again.

Samuel
01:04:20
That's it, we've all lost lads.

Matthew
01:04:21
Quick tr truce between me, Dave and Sam. Let's take him down.

Samuel
01:04:25
Dave, Dave, you're gonna need more adjectives when you pick your next game, I'm afraid. I hope you got a uh a deep bench.

Dave Scarborough
01:04:30
I mean I actually got a text message during that, so I didn't hear a single word of it, but well done Nash. I'm joking, I'm joking, very very very eloquently put. Great game.

Samuel
01:04:40
Yeah, that's uh it's well it's it's it's yeah that's awesome I think um and uh yeah nice uh to hear about. Matthew, was that a memorable moment for you in that game? Is that what you would have picked from Majorist Mask?

Matthew
01:04:51
Uh yeah, I know I must admit I I hadn't thought about Majora's Mask for this, but uh yes, I'm certainly uh, you know, um a more emotional questline. I think the Majora's Mask stuff is so memorable because it's a little bit more like hard one. You know, this is before everything being spelled out it quite explicitly in the way that sort of modern Nintendo games are and the Zelda games are sort of almost the design for you to sort of see every bit of them and the idea that you can kind of like puzzle away at this thing and like mess it up and then maybe get a little further on the next run and then you get this lovely kind of payoff at the end. You know, it's it's probably the closest the Zelda RPGs ever came to having like proper knotty living questlines out in the world. Um So yeah, it's a gr it's a really nice pick.

Dave Scarborough
01:05:41
Dave, we come to you.

Matthew
01:05:48
When do you crack out this secret weapon you keep boasting about?

Dave Scarborough
01:05:52
Uh no, I'll save that. Save that for later. Um I think I will go with uh for first uh person shooter level single player I'm gonna go with Half-Life 2 and I'm gonna go with Raven Home. Um or the um uh we don't go to Raven Home chapter I mean this guys, like, you know, we're all PC gamers here. Like, this is this is iconic. This is one of the most genre-defining levels in in all of first-person shooters. You just get the gravity gun just before you arrive, and then what's sort of laid out upon you is just like these various tools for like mass carnage, you know, picking up uh what would you call them like razor blades, um sword blades, and just flinging them around at zombies like a psychopath, chopping things in half, chopping the head crabs off the top of the bodies. And then when you actually explore Like Raven Home itself, it's like this self-contained horror story that's just this really eerie, creepy, like quite oppressive sort of environment around it. It's a scarier side to Half-Life and I think if you've played sort of Half-Life Alex A lot of it feels of that game feels like this. Um, but it's a big tone shift within Half-Life 2. Um, but it's also just sort sort of like this glorious celebration of the physics engine. in the game. You meet Father Grigori and like he just laid out all these various traps, you know, I think was it was it like in the the original sort of like demo video they put out the the sort of um propeller blades spinning around that you set off and then chopping chopping all off in half. Like that that just felt like s so mind-blowing back in whenever it came out, 2000 and Someone's gonna help me here four. I was gonna say three. Um but like it's it it's it's not only just like this this incredibly atmospheric environment that you enter, but you're given what is one of the most like iconic and fun and inventive weapons in modern FPSs. Uh and it's just like puts its physics engine on full display and it's just um Like just incredibly like fun to just toy around that whole area.

Samuel
01:08:02
Yeah, an excellent pick, Dave. Uh I think this is the standout level from Half-Life 2. I think they all go on for about fifteen minutes too long the levels in this game. That was my take when I played it again last yeah. That's probably just my um ADHD'd up uh millennial um sort of attention span um to be honest.

Dave Scarborough
01:08:20
Like I definitely felt that way. And I'll be crucified for this because I can't remember the name of the level. But the the one where you're cruising around on the on the boat, like that go that goes on and on.

Matthew
01:08:31
Isn't it like canal something?

Samuel
01:08:32
Uh yeah, something like that. It's uh yeah, I can't remember the exact name of it, but it's something like that, yeah.

Matthew
01:08:39
Yeah. I thought it was like a pun, like root root canal or something.

Samuel
01:08:42
I think it is root canal, yeah, it is. Yeah, I do like the um the level where you're going uh along the beach um fighting those bipedal alien monster things. But yeah, I think that this is definitely the this is up there. Uh Nova Prospect's a bit too hard as well, so I think this I think this does end up being the standout level. And I do think the the physics are a huge part of that and yeah, what a way to introduce introduce you to the gravity guard. Also just the way the level is introduced where you're sort of like Kind of just chucked out back of the secret base and it's like, well, you gotta go this way now. Sorry about that. And it's just, you know, um it is it's not like the scariest level, but it it's singular among all the other chapters in the game.

Dave Scarborough
01:09:18
It's quite tense for a wimp like me. It does contain jump scares, it does like have that that sort of sense where you kind of creep a little bit slower around corners in case something's like a head crab is just gonna suddenly jump out at you. So it it does f it is effective to me, but I am a massive wimp.

Matthew
01:09:33
Yeah, no I I I thought this was really scary and I I I actually kinda resented it the first time I played because I knew the gravity gun was coming and that that was like the big thing and you get this this toy which should suddenly be, you know, incredibly playful. And it and it is, but the fact that they then dump you in this sort of like horror playground with all these nightmare enemies, which I didn't like. I you know, it it doesn't undermine the gravity gun, but I remember thinking like, ah, this is this is a bit shitty, like I I actually want to be messing around with all the you know, combine guys with this. Uh but I've come to appreciate that it's quite an interesting sort of, you know, subvert your expectations I guess, or it's definitely not not where you expect that game to go at that moment, which is classic Valve. Classic Valve for sure. It's CADs. Matthew, what's your next pick? So uh here's a question. For first person shooter If you spend a lot of a game with a gun in your hands.

Samuel
01:10:27
Are you gonna are you gonna argue an immersive sim is a first-person shooter? Potentially. It well it depends. If it's depends on the game, I think. Like I wouldn't allow Deus Ex. I would allow no one lives forever. Right. Does that make sense?

Matthew
01:10:40
Now, what about Bioshock?

Samuel
01:10:42
Uh I would count Bioshock, yeah. I think that counts. What do you what do the other two think? Actually? Oh, sorry.

Ash
01:10:47
Yep. Yep. It counts.

Samuel
01:10:49
Yep. Yep. Yeah, it's definitely a first-person shooter.

Matthew
01:10:52
You agree, Dave? On the sliding scale of immersive Sims, I think that's closer to the sort of shooty shooty end of the of the thing. In which case for first person shooter level single player, I'm gonna take Fort Frolic from Bioshock. Nice. A classic bit of narrative design this level, you arrive, it's the playpen of Oh fuck, I've forgotten his name. Xander Cohen. Xander Cohen, that's it. Who has uh sort of turned you know all the all the people who are there and escaping into these sort of nightmarish clay sculptures. It's turn it into a big sort of experimental art piece and I think it's the combination of A, it's it's just one of the more interesting bits of Rapture that you get to explore. You know, it's it's the it's like the entertainment zone, so there's always, you know, fun conceptual shops and entertainment places to see. But then it's also having this little like narrative through line of interacting with him and what he wants you to do and achieve. And it's you know, it's really scary. It does that classic kind of like mannequin thing of, you know, there there seem to be a lot of uh potential threats everywhere and that's really nightmarish. And I you know, I I definitely think this is the area of the game most people, you know, remember you know, you remember a couple of moments, you pr you know, you remember the arrival, you probably remember the big plot twist in it, but in terms of an actual space you spend time in, I do think Fort Frolic is is probably the one for this.

Samuel
01:12:22
Yeah, it's certainly the the one that people remember as being like a a big moment in the game. I can't say I remember much about the place, the space itself, um, to look back on. I just remember yeah, the arrival of Sander Cohen and the Mannequins and you know, but that's That's almost enough. Like, um, in some ways, Bioshock is a whole game of areas that are vying to be like the coolest area, um, or vying to be like the strangest, like most distinctive area. So I think this does win out on that basis for sure. Yeah, I mean, uh this is prime for a replay. I think at some point Matthew will probably replay this for the podcast. It feels like something that we would do at some point down the line. Ash Fort Frolic, do you have many memories of this?

Ash
01:13:03
It feels like a long time ago now. This and I've I've never replayed Bioshock. I played it and loved it. back in the day. So so like Matthew says, there's certain bits that stand out for me, but I I don't particularly remember like locations or level designs beyond the aesthetic or or the moment to moment gameplay. Um so I can't have much of an opinion on this I'm afraid. So I can't disagree with it.

Dave Scarborough
01:13:30
They all do kind of blend into each other. For like like for me, like I remember the moment I don't remember the locations. I'm just agree I've disagree what others have said, Matthew. I'm so I'm sorry, I'm just you know For It's a it's a great it's a great visual it's a great looking game, I just can't distinguish between the different areas very well. In my mind, because I haven't played it since it came out. Matthew's going, Oh you're odd.

Matthew
01:13:49
It'

Dave Scarborough
01:13:51
Wait, could I have had Ghost No Ghostbusters was third person, wasn't it?

Samuel
01:13:57
Um I mean yeah, I think you if you're gonna pick one by shock. section it would be this uh Matthew. Um I did weigh up this um this section as well. This was like I think third or fourth in my my picks. Um I also had um Battleship Bay from Bioshock Infinite but no one would have remembered that. Yeah, I was I was about to say that. That would go higher for me. It's really interesting that this category is the one we filled up first. Clearly we all see this as like a potential vote winner um important to get off the board. Matthew, I think you have another pick.

Matthew
01:14:25
Yes.

Samuel
01:14:26
Okay.

Matthew
01:14:27
For multiplayer level, can't be an FPS I'm gonna take Temple in Super Smash Brothers melee. Oh Temple. That's that that's good. That's good. For for me it's it's the stage I associate with Smash Brothers.

Ash
01:14:42
Is is that the Zelda level?

Matthew
01:14:43
Yeah, it's the Zelda. It has the amazing music based. Based on the music from Zelda 2, the da da da da da da da da Oh, it's great. Um da da da da da da. Um Yeah, we'll play a little bit in the podcast maybe. We'll be doing that.

Samuel
01:14:57
Matthew will be doing a whole concert this, by the way, um in August this year at the Royal Albert Hall.

Matthew
01:15:01
So look forward to that in Plant Brothers. It's a huge level. Like it's out it's absolutely massive. You know, there's the area up top where you've got a few different places you can fight up there, but it's got this little platform that kind of hangs underneath, and it's like this intense little kill room because in the Smash Brothers you obviously drive up people's damage and then the higher the damage the further they fly but in this particular little pocket if you fire people up, they just kind of ricochet between the ceiling and the floor. Like you can really trap people in there and that's where I just remembered like some ridiculous fights where we'd get up into sort of 250% damage or something, and you just couldn't get people out of there, and it was the wildest fights could take place in there. And I like the idea of a map where If you go down into that bit of the map, it's like you're agreeing that it's the kind of chaos zone and that you're looking for a particular kind of fight, while more civilized people can stay up top, uh, where it's a more reasonable game of Smash Brothers can play out and That duality I think is really fun and it's uh you know, I I love the scale of it. It's it was so big and exciting when the cap you know, when you're all at different ends and the camera pulls right back and You can see the whole thing. It looks amazing. It must be the biggest map. It still must be the biggest stage they've done.

Dave Scarborough
01:16:16
I don't know, because they've added the width of it, it's just it's huge. If you've got people on opposite sides of the top platform. I loved it I love this stage.

Matthew
01:16:24
Yeah, it's oh I'm gonna be real just really up front with you guys. Please don't someone steal or kill this one, because this J. Oh come on.

Samuel
01:16:32
There's no there's no sacred rule for yours versus other people's picks. Go fuck yourself. This is my favourite thing I'm gonna pick.

Ash
01:16:39
You've painted a target on your back by saying that.

Samuel
01:16:42
Come on. Well why is that more sacred than any other pick in this draft?

Matthew
01:16:46
That's more sacred than the Sonic 2 Half-Pike. Like for a thing of of what I'm gonna pick and what I want.

Samuel
01:16:51
No. I absolutely reject that. Forget that.

Dave Scarborough
01:16:54
I feel like I'd be the one most tempted to steal it as well.

Samuel
01:16:57
He's got like an this is in a in a file that on some Matthews desktop called Draft Strategy V two twenty twenty six and in there'll be like, Oh, I'll just make the case of like my pick is like this is more emotionally meaningful to me so don't come after it. This is like the new I'm not having it Matthew. Okay, whoever takes this I'm absolutely instantly killing the biggest game on their list for sure. Uh we're definitely in a bit of a mutually assured destruction phase, I would say, with the old kill and steal takens this time. Um which is interesting. But Matthew can I just ask you which Smash Bros this is from again? Super Smash Bros. Melee. I think that this is a a great pick. I th actually think that Smash Bros. melee, Smash Bros in particular, I think you actually need that really built-in personal experience to make a good case for a pick in this because If you're on unsteady ground, there's actually like not really a consensus on what the true best like levels are. There's a really like huge mix of opinions out there on this. I definitely saw this mentioned a few times, but like I would have picked like Big Blue, for example, from Melee, which I just love the moving vehicles in that one. But like it's yeah, I I like the idea of knowing it well enough to break it down in the detail that you did.

Dave Scarborough
01:18:04
Can I bring up something on this, right? In case Ash tries to steal it. We were talking about this draft the other night and I said to him, Smash Brothers has great levels and he says they're all the same. Um he says I said that's a weird statement. Well what did I specifically say? I'm I'm right I'm reading it for Batum They're just a few platforms you can get knocked off. So I literally re-downloaded uh Smash Bros. on my switcher. I said, let's fucking play right now. And I waited in a lobby for him for 20 minutes and he never showed up.

Ash
01:18:37
What I didn't tell you is that I was on holiday and I had no intention of joining.

Dave Scarborough
01:18:42
That's true. You didn't tell me that you were like, go on then. They've just sat there waiting for you. Excited. Telling my wife Ash is finally gonna play Smash Brothers with me.

Ash
01:18:51
He's finally gonna play with me.

Samuel
01:18:53
Oh, I'm sorry, Dave. I tell you I'll tell you what, Matthew, it would be cool to do a bit of Saturday afternoon uh map multiplayer in Smash Bros. That might be fun one time at your house.

Matthew
01:19:02
If I'm still invited after dismissing your draft strategy as bullshits, but uh No, no, all you have to do is not steal or kill Temple from Super Smash Bros. We remain friends outside the podcast.

Dave Scarborough
01:19:13
Right. I uh this will be a deciding factor, Matthew. Who do you play as in Smash? Who's your character?

Matthew
01:19:18
I I play as I play as lots of different people. We I I I have a go I play as Samus quite a lot and I always I always did like Link. Obviously to begin with played loads of Kirby because everyone's just doing the old down special attack on each other. A lot of Pikachu down lightning attack as well, there's a lot of that bullshit. But uh yeah, I like I like Link and I like Samus.

Samuel
01:19:38
Okay. Put aside his hatred of Pokemon just to troll his siblings. That's uh

Dave Scarborough
01:19:43
I stay by my I only play as Luigi in Mario games for all Luigi. Luigi is the one in Smash.

Samuel
01:19:50
Should we just do an episode about Smash? Should we just do a Smash Bruce draft where you gotta pick like best fighter level actually bonus stages they've got some great bonus stages support trophies that could be fun that might be that might actually actually might be fun be pretty throwaway but be quite good fun Not for Ash who just thinks all the stage is a platform shot. Even you Ash must appreciate the picto chat. level. That's rad as shit in that game.

Dave Scarborough
01:20:24
choices in this category, it was a coin flip between Temple and Pokemon Stadium in melee, which just transforms around you as the as the match goes on.

Samuel
01:20:33
Well, I hope you've all enjoyed this 20-minute Smash Bros. podcast within the podcast. Um we'll be back next week with the rest of the draft episode, so look forward to that. It's now midnight. Dave, what's your next pick?

Dave Scarborough
01:20:44
Uh I think I've really fucked up the level location. I'd do my worst enemy too because I've I've picked good games with scary levels. Uh so I'll come back to that later once I thought about it.

Samuel
01:20:54
No, that's okay. Again, like it's not Like you're gonna lose that if you pick, you know, a sort of uh an area from Silent Hill 2 or something. That's not gonna be a problem, I don't think or like that That super that big mall where the mannequins are in condemned. No one's gonna be like, oh fuck this pit. Because they'll all be like, guess what? I don't want to live there.

Dave Scarborough
01:21:12
See, this is this is with Ash's game plan because Ash told me this was what the category was. And then he also told me Smash Brothers was a bad choice for multiplayer.

Matthew
01:21:19
So he's he's been game he's been gameplaying me for weeks on this.

Samuel
01:21:24
Um but no, I'm gonna go multiplayer. Ash doesn't even organise the draft. He should have just asked us in the email chain if you had confusion.

Dave Scarborough
01:21:31
We talk to you one hour a day, so it's really tough to uh fit in all my questions out.

Samuel
01:21:36
That is bullshit. You never respond on weekends because you're like, I've got to spend time with my kids, Samuel. And I'm like, That's fine, Dave. I wasn't gonna say that.

Dave Scarborough
01:21:42
I've literally never said that. I'm like, please distract me from them. Um No, I'm gonna go multiplayer, non-fps. I'm gonna go Mario Kart 64, and I'm gonna go Toad's Turnpike. Again, this was a coin flip. Uh, could have gone uh with a couple of options here. Um the uh Rainbow Road being one of them, obviously. The I can't remember the name of it now. but the ghost dock area uh is pretty cool. But Toast Tanpike, I think, is like a child of the 90s, not born in the 90s, but you know playing games in the nineties. This was um the one you go back to again and again and again playing playing with round your friend's house on a Saturday morning. The idea of just having this traffic in there, this density of obstacles that you had to navigate around. There were sort of like fun little ramps on some of them. You had ways you could sort of go around them up the sides of the track. Like it was I think it just felt really novel, unique, and interesting, and it created this completely different feel to a Mario Kart course. And yeah, it it gave you just so many options to just Fucking get one up over the people you're playing against to sort of sabotage them, to s like get a bit of Schadenfreud when they you seem crashing to the back of a lorry and you just like you know, just cruise ahead of them and get the elite. You know, before the blue shell bullshit came into Mario Kart, you know, this was one of those levels where it felt like it could really make or break who the who the best players were. And yeah, love it. It's iconic.

Matthew
01:23:06
I think the problem I have with Mario Kart is that Mario Kart 8 has just done such an like number on me and like rewritten in my brain like what Mario Kart is. that I find it quite hard to go back in terms of things I want to play and go back in terms of memory.

Dave Scarborough
01:23:21
Marikart is definitely a better game now, or certainly with uh Marikart 8. But I think all the tracks that people remember for the most part are from this era and like have been have been recreated in various forms in the game since.

Matthew
01:23:35
In in a similar way to that Goldeneye is just synonymous with multiplayer. Yeah. Marikart sixty four definitely is and yes, for a large chunk of people they have spent their time. I just d I just don't know if Everyone has like a different trap that they're fond of. Like I don't know if there is like a this is the track.

Ash
01:23:55
This isn't my Yeah. It's never as good the remake ones.

Dave Scarborough
01:24:11
They've added they've added too too much to it to to sort of make it more interactive or to like you know Different cars do different things.

Matthew
01:24:18
Too many amazing graphics and too much amazing music.

Dave Scarborough
01:24:21
The problem is now with a controller that actually lets you be able to like move the car in a in a way that doesn't feel clunky, it just makes it too easy now.

Samuel
01:24:30
Well um okay, well I'm glad someone's uh saw the Smash Bros pick and was like, right, the m time to crack out the Mario Kart's now. Like I can see a new battleground has emerged in these uh in the draft.

Matthew
01:24:43
A bigger battleground in terms of like y you can win over more hearts, hearts and minds with Marikart than you can Smash Brothers.

Samuel
01:24:50
I don't necessarily think that's true, but I think there are quite a few Mario Kart games is the advantage you have. Like if we had done the thing where you shut off the entire series, it'd be more competitive, but I don't know.

Matthew
01:25:02
I kinda like I don't I don't think it

Samuel
01:25:04
I don't think you should.

Matthew
01:25:05
Um No. I think it's just I don't know, m surely Mario Kart 8's gotta have more cachet than anything. It's one of the best selling games of all time.

Samuel
01:25:12
But I think Dave is smartly tapping into nostalgia here though.

Matthew
01:25:15
Like I think that's a big part of it's not the game.

Samuel
01:25:19
That's all we talked about.

Dave Scarborough
01:25:19
It's the level, not the game. Yeah. Mario Kart 8 is a better game, obviously, because it's just a good thing. But it's not as good as the original version. The original version just has something to it.

Ash
01:25:29
Dave, you do mean yourself if you say that. Just say yes. It is in the most popular game.

Samuel
01:25:33
Dave is like never ever admit you're wrong um under any circumstances. That's your strategy, Dave. Yeah, very trumpy. Yeah.

Ash
01:25:42
Okay, so uh Ash, what's your next pick? For light gun stage, will you allow me to pick? something from point blank.

Samuel
01:25:50
Yes, because I thought about this too, having just played about um f fifteen credits worth of point blank two at the weekend Ash.

Ash
01:25:56
Go for it. I was I was worried because th it's kind it's kind of like They're kind of like mini games, really, but I'm not you've said yes, I'm not gonna talk you out of it.

Samuel
01:26:04
They also do repeat themselves the minigames in different forms, so I feel like together they sort of coalesce into one Level if if that makes sense, you know.

Ash
01:26:13
I'm gonna go for a level called Falling Leaf. It's a very simple level. You have one bullet. and there is a leaf slowly falling down the screen and kind of swaying from side to side i in the wind. So you've got one one chance to shoot this leaf with your single bullet, and it's easier said than done because of the the motion that it's taking as as it gently falls. Which I think is it's a great skill test i in a in a light gun game. There's n there's no greater skill test in these games than trying to make a a precise shot where you've only got one chance And you know, it comes in the middle of a game where, you know, a lot of the a lot of the stages in point blank, you've got infinite ammo, you're mindlessly firing away, trying to hit as many targets as possible. in a strict time limit, so most of point blank rewards quite frantic, furious play. And then this one like puts on the brakes and says, no, you've got you've got to become like a Zen master now. Like you've got to like really like dial in and slow down and and be and be precise, um which I think is is w is part of the beauty of point blank is that it can switch dynamically between all these different ways of playing. I I remember as as a teenager playing this game and whenever this uh particular level came up, I was like, mmm, this is this an this is an opportunity to like really show that I can I can shoot a virtual gun at a screen uh and show off to my mates. No one no one cared. Uh but I cared as well, and I and I still care today when I play this. I'm always really like smug and satisfied when the falling leaf comes Mm.

Samuel
01:27:49
Yeah, I uh I I honestly don't really know this one, so can't comment on it either way. Uh Matthew, Dave, can you? No. I've never played it.

Matthew
01:28:00
It's a classic. Never played point.

Samuel
01:28:03
Very heartfelt.

Ash
01:28:04
People know point blank. I'm confident with this.

Samuel
01:28:07
I did j I did just look it up and it is cool actually. I can see why I can see why you pick this. Like it's A pretty elegant little thing that by the way you would never be able to do with the absolutely fucked light guns they have in um Cardiff's NQ 64. Um no precision on those bad boys, they are dunzo. Um but Does it require more skills than navigating a half pipe in uh Sonic 2? It's hard to hard to call reader, those half pipes are an absolute bitch, but uh nonetheless. Um okay. Uh two for you. Two for you, Sam. Time for me uh to pick one then, yeah. So I I would also take Lie Gun Game, let's get out of the way. And I'm gonna take mission three of Ghost Squad, which takes in it takes place entirely in a jungle and starts with you sniping loads of lads in a hideout in this hideout, then has you going through a forest shooting dudes and diffusing mines. And then ends with an absolutely fucking amazing river boat, river chase, and battle with like a dudes in helicopters and fucking lads up on like jet skis and shit. It's really like an amazing light gun shooter sort of set piece craft in this. And it is the bit where I was like, when I when I sat down to think about this category, I was like, what is the bit from Ghost squad that just comes to mind more than anything else. And it is just going through this jungle and it's just a mix of like, let's have a light gun bit where you're sniping lads. Let's have you just trying to Not kill um civilians in the jungle while diffusing mines and then ending it with like this fucking amazing battle against uh Yeah, like loads and loads of guys while moving up a river. That happens quite a few light gun games to be honest. Time Crisis 2 also has a bit, um like two bits, I think, where you're going um quickly up a river um shooting lads, but I thought Ghost Squads was just a tiny bit more memorable. Matthew, did you consider picking this game?

Matthew
01:29:56
Ghost Squad was was my um pretty much single pick that I had for Light Gun Stage. I would have picked the first stage just 'cause it's that wooden lodge where all the terrorists jump out from underneath the bed.

Samuel
01:30:07
Oh yeah, you love that shit, don't you?

Matthew
01:30:08
Uh it always makes me laugh just how many terrorists are in like one tiny hotel. Uh yeah, tr truly a wonder. I absolutely love Ghost Squad, but uh not enough to have explored the other offerings in the light gun genre, so not tricky.

Samuel
01:30:23
Well um yeah I guess I guess I'll see how that pans out. Um Ash we get away in?

Ash
01:30:27
Yeah, uh it's it's funny that um Matthew said he prefers the first stage 'cause I prefer the second one, the one the one that's set on on Air Force One. Uh yeah, which I th I think just goes to show that like that there's there are no like, I think that's the first one. like let down moments in Ghost Squad like it is All Killer All Time. It's my favorite light gun game, so um I'm really delighted that it's on this list.

Samuel
01:30:50
Nice. Um well we'll see if that'll survive a steel token from Matthew Castle or not, I suppose. But that's fine. I could just pick the time crisis two level where you shoot a load of wooden barrels that are rolling down that hill.

Dave Scarborough
01:31:01
Whoa whoa and step on my shoes, pal.

Samuel
01:31:05
And if not that then I don't know, something from House of the Dead. I played that the other day and found it very confusing to be honest. The tone of that game was um really all over the place. Anyway, um okay, n one other pick. What will I take? I think I'm going to take my first person shooter level multiplayer and I think so tempted to double dip on Halo. But I think it makes sense to sort of spread out a little bit in terms of the picks. And I'll take Facing Worlds from Unreal Tournament, which is perhaps the uh the most kind of like rem well remembered map from that that game um because it's basically two towers facing each other with these two bridges separating them and just below in the skybox is basically like Pla a a massive planet below you. I assume planet Earth. I can't I'm not really that familiar with the lore of the Unreal games. But it is such a distinctive looking map. It is like Sniper Hell basically. Lads going to the top of these two towers and popping off against each other. This amazing music that's playing. And it really is just like simple, uh like a uh simply built, but like has amazing depth to it kind of kind of map. It's perfect for like capture the flag is obviously what it's built for because you're just precariously running from one side to the other Kind of like poking your head over this bridge, no doubt getting like sniped and it it just basically turning into like this war of attrition as you try and get lads over that bridge to steal that flag. But it's really really cool. I mean I played this w a few years ago. Just before Epic turned the servers off, I I for out of nowhere, I just thought I'd just play a bit of Unreal Tournament. I had it on GOG and I thought I'd play it. And I just even playing this map with bots, it's like It's such a a cool product of its time where they would just stuff these games with maps. And because you have so many and because they're not all like mega polish, you would get like these most h the most high concept ones where the designers are like, um I'll do uh you know wherever I what I'll just experiment with this and see how it goes. And um Yeah, it's it is just really really cool. Like it a lot of the maps in that game are great in a kind of meat and potatoes sort of way, but This just has that high concept, like very specific look and feel to it, and it's very beloved. And I think it was just designed by one guy because games used to be made by one person. Cedric Fiorentino apparently designed this map. And twenty-seven years later I think it still stands the set the test of time. Do any of you know this map?

Dave Scarborough
01:33:36
Yeah. Yeah. I will go as far to say I think this is my first experience of playing an an online game. Irresponsible parenting. Uh God rest my dad. Uh my dad were my dad was a taxi driver uh in Ware near where I grew up and during the summer holidays. would just leave me in an internet cafe while he worked for eight hours of the day and I would just sit uh so what nineteen ninety nine I was eleven and he'd just leave me in uh an internet cafe for eight hours of the day playing whatever they would let me play there One of the games was it called Kingpin? There was like that old uh uh. So I'd play that, I'd play Postal, and I'd play uh Unreal Tournament. And uh this this blew my mind like I I just say it's it it's just uh i i it it's so white knuckle, like, for for like an early FPS experience, like those little narrow walkways between the two towers, th the fact that it's just like s uh an absolute sniper pit, like just avoiding all of that gunfire and just yeah, I dunno I don't know how to articulate really because it's as like a a So simple. It's it's so simple, but for like your first like online multiplayer experience, it it it it covers all the fundamentals and it gives you that that that sort of feeling, that that sort of competitive uh compulsion to keep playing. It just it has all that packed into just such a a small simple level design that that I was just obsessed with it for for like several weeks of uh of a summer that I was stuck in internet cafe um on my own.

Samuel
01:35:09
Hmm. Well I'm glad someone else has played it because I think it is um it is amazing. The the music that plays in it as well it has a preposterous name of foregone destruction. And um there was definitely a phase on tech radar where I listened to the hour-long mix of that on a loop. Um and uh it's just great shit. But um yeah, a great map from a great game just when first person shooters were really coming into their own um in in that kind of online arena and they were doing such cool stuff with the maps. So um Yep. I think a lot I think anyone who played this game will remember this map, so um yeah.

Matthew
01:35:41
It's kinda crazy that people would nail these maps that became iconic, y not by accident, but with i s so little thought compared to the the the crazy focus testing that goes on today and like the whole industry around making a single multiplayer map. where like one person could make something which stands the test of time for 30 years.

Samuel
01:36:04
Um like the art of that is is you know super impressive Yeah, it's funny because I I have definitely seen like versions of this in other games. Like there's a map in Halo that's a bit like this in a sense that it's sort of it's sort of symmetrical and it's captured the flag and it is like go from It's like what uh it's ex exactly the same the same route you take there and back and you just sort of know where the potential pitfalls or like weapons are and stuff. And so Is that blood gulch? No, but I do love Blood Gulch and I think that's got some of the DNA as well because that that that too is like two bases that face each other across the map. That was actually my second pick for this um this category. Um and that has the similar thing where like instead of the little bri the connecting bridges that facing worlds has, it has those little like bumps in the in the turf where like You know, p Master Chief will like pop up or and s or sort of like hide behind it and it turns into like sniper alley basically. So Yeah, like I guess it's it's like probably one of the most influential maps. It's just that because of the building blocks of Unreal Tournament, it's just so sort of like It's so basic the actual presentation of it, but so striking.

Matthew
01:37:10
Um but I think like a map like this, you could see it's influencing something and uh it might get picked, so I mean

Dave Scarborough
01:37:17
I'll I'll mention anyway. Uh but like it it's influencing on something like Nuketown, you know, in Call of Duty, which is so simple, it's just two sides, and then there's just this this area in the middle that is just open to fire, but people have to move back and forth, back and forth. And as you say, like it's it's incredibly simple, but the the the there is strategy and complexity in how you navigate around it. And um, you know, it makes the best out of teamwork, but it also makes the best out of individual skills as well. And it's not like the level is sort of cheating you out of of any any uh any advantage you have as as a player and as like a sp you know, whether you're a sniper or whether you're you're more of a a sort of run and gun type, like it is just purely down to to who you are as a player in those type of maps and this sort of set the like was the first of it.

Samuel
01:38:05
Well put, Dave. Uh shame it wasn't your pick. Ash, we come to you.

Ash
01:38:11
Still could be. Okay, okay. Platforming level, I would like to take Peach's Castle from Super Mario 64. This is the this is the hub world, effectively. Exactly. Super Mario 64. It counts. It's it's counts. It does count because there are challenges um that you need to do um in in this world. There there's uh platforming to do, there's secrets to find. This is this is kind of the brilliance of Peach's Castle. I I remember exactly when I first played Mario 64, I was in a Toys or Uz in Wakefield and then a demo station uh and I was running around in Peachers Castle having a great time and I genuinely didn't know it was meant to be the hub world. I just thought it was like the first level in a in a in a linear level based game. I remember running around for ages having a great time jumping off the walls, climbing up you know, climbing up that first tree and like backflipping off it. Uh and then this guy who was queuing behind me, he he was like, why don't you try jumping into one of the paintings? Like he obviously knew and it kind of blew my mind like, oh there's There's levels inside the level.

Matthew
01:39:14
Did you turn around and it was me and Moto?

Ash
01:39:16
It was Suji Nafka Tutsy behind me. Um and then obviously, you know, eventually bought the game and and And took it home and and and discovered that there's like there's amazing depth to the this, you know, j you know, Dave saying, Isn't that the hub world? Yeah, it is, but it's you can't really like dismiss it as as just this mechanism for selecting a level. There's great depth within Peaches Castle itself and like loads of secrets to find, little yellow rabbit to to chase around and catch. Uh the fact that um you can like swim in the moat outside and then later on you can find a switch. that like drains the moat so you can like walk through do doors and find new areas. Like it is th the first part of Mario 64 that you engage with And uh is is a bit of a playground to begin with. Like there's there's not much like threat in Mario 64, but like this is the place where you learn how this um kind of more open interpretation of a platform game works uh and also the place that dozens of hours in keeps rewarding you with new surprises like it's very Nintendo in that regard. So um I think it is the best part of Mario Sixty Four.

Dave Scarborough
01:40:31
This is some Bullshit.

Samuel
01:40:34
Matthew, what do you think of this?

Matthew
01:40:36
I don't think it's bullshit. I think it's a very valid pick. It's the place everyone learned well not everyone. It's the place that people of good taste learned what a 3D platform were like. was gonna be like and how they worked. So yeah, I th I just think it's like d a crucial part of Yeah, that genre's journey. I swear I read somewhere that at one point Mary sixty four might have just been the castle. And they're like, well that's good enough. Like you can just play you know, someone said, Well, I think this is this in itself is enough, like just being in this place. And then they were like, Well actually we should go to these other levels Maybe I'm conflating that with another story, but um yeah I I think it's I think it's an amazing level. And I too remember getting this and exploring it and thinking, well this is it, this must be the whole game. And then you discover that yeah there are these other levels, there are loads of levels. But um yeah the secrets keep coming. A a great pick. And now a ripost from Day Scar. It's bullshit!

Dave Scarborough
01:41:33
Like I I can just pick the entire the GTA 5 map Like it's like this is the end of the street. What do you mean? It's like it's It's not level, it's it it houses the levels. In the same way that I could I could pick Arkham City which houses the bitches.

Ash
01:41:55
Look Dave, if you don't allow this, I'm picking Sonic Adventure 2. Dude, dude, you know this is bullshit. Don't make me pick this big.

Dave Scarborough
01:42:02
You know this isn't a level. This isn't this isn't what the what the category is.

Ash
01:42:06
It's a great great level and I'm sure.

Dave Scarborough
01:42:08
It's a great it's a great like it's a great map. I won't call it a great level. You know? It's not a platform in level.

Samuel
01:42:15
But it is just a hub that connects to all the other levels, Dave. So how is it like it's not like it contains all the other levels, is it? It just it just is its own level. Ash doesn't get all the other levels as part of this. No, he just gets the c he just gets the castle itself, don't you?

Dave Scarborough
01:42:29
I would I would argue is uh it is a environment It is not a platforming level. I think a level has a goal, whereas Peach Castle doesn't have a goal. Oh, I see what you mean.

Matthew
01:42:38
I think someone's upset they didn't pick the Comet Observatory in Mario Galaxy.

Samuel
01:42:44
Yeah, I guess this is like picking Hyrule Field or something, in a sense, but like it's uh but you know, uh Matthew Garrison.

Dave Scarborough
01:42:54
purely exists to give you access to to the actual levels.

Matthew
01:42:58
But it has the shape and the function of all the other levels. It looks like one. Yeah yeah but it's in a game.

Samuel
01:43:04
You've already but you've already got Mario Galaxy, I don't know why this would bother you.

Ash
01:43:09
Like in Yeah, I I think he's coming across as a little bit threatened.

Dave Scarborough
01:43:13
I just think it's rule breaking. That's all I think it is, and I'm a stickler for the rules. Sure. Is it like oh I don't know.

Samuel
01:43:19
Anyway, okay. Well I'm just gonna allow it because I think that's I think that's fine. I don't think you've over over stretched anything there necessarily.

Ash
01:43:26
Thank you.

Samuel
01:43:52
Then uh I think we come back to you, Dave, so what do you got pal? I have to calm down now.

Dave Scarborough
01:43:57
I have to get my blood pressure down

Matthew
01:43:59
You should kill Peach's Castle. That would be great. If you're really offended by it, kill it.

Dave Scarborough
01:44:05
I could. Yeah. I think there's stuff I could actually kill that would hurt uh hurt Ash way more. I'm going light gun stage. And um I'm gonna go this is truly a curse category, by the way. Uh just to put it out front. Awful. Um awful

Samuel
01:44:21
I'm gonna go so Why don't we have a stealth category? Why don't we have a hitman level? I mean, oh, so many missed opportunities. Oh dear. Uh I'm gonna go with the

Dave Scarborough
01:44:34
T-Rex fight from the Lost World Jurassic Park arcade game. Now um it's it's cool. I I can't tell you how terrified I was of dinosaurs while also simultaneously thinking that they were the coolest fucking thing, like, for a child my age when I was uh ten years old. And when the Lost World cabinet came out and like It's in um it's like in that sort of like uh c enclosed design and you just see like the lightning and something has survived and like the the giant T-Rex on the screen like roaring. It used to scare the shit out of me. And so playing a game after sort of, I think it's like the first couple of stages, you get to uh a scene that is reminiscent of the first Jurassic Park movie where um Ian Malcolm and Ellie, Dr. Ellie sat there are being chased uh by a T-Rex on the back of the uh while they're on the in the Jeep. And you have to shoot at it and it grabs you and lifts you up and shakes you around, and then you have to sort of shoot various different target points to release the other player. But on that screen in that enclosed dark space, it was truly terrifying. And it's just one of those sort of like It's actually put me off playing those Lycon games for many years after that because I found it so intense and scary. But at the same time, I felt it was actually a really good. uh representation of like Jurassic Park, that that franchise, sort of that sort of horror leading aspect to to to that series and I felt like As a light gun game, it was pretty fun. It was pretty good. I mean, you are pretty much just shooting raptors uh the whole time, which um it feels like that would have been a really like simple thing that they could have done in the movies, just like taking assault rifles and just blown them all up. But you know uh in the light gun gave it's it's pretty light work to to decimate about a hundred raptors in about ten minutes. But uh yeah, the T-Rex segment is cool.

Samuel
01:46:21
This looks rad.

Dave Scarborough
01:46:21
Yeah.

Samuel
01:46:22
This looks really good. Like the way it jumps it runs out of the mist. It's like really It scared the shit out.

Dave Scarborough
01:46:26
You could see why that would scare the shit out of you as a young kid though, just in this like dark little box and a giant screen in front of you and that thing coming towards you.

Samuel
01:46:34
Yeah, it's uh looks like a cool game. I wish I played it actually. Um I wonder if that's the one the in the um the Frontier office they've got one in the cafeteria, but I don't know if it's this one or a more recent one. Could never really picture David Braben sitting down and playing it to be honest.

Matthew
01:46:48
David Braben putting all his pocket money in at lunch.

Samuel
01:46:54
Okay, um good stuff. We come back to you, Matthew, for two picks.

Matthew
01:46:57
For platforming level, I don't know if this is right, but I do love it and it's a it's a great game. I'm gonna take From Super Mario Odyssey, I'm gonna take Bowser's Kingdom, which, if you don't remember it, is the for an ultimate level where it's like a sort of Japanese sort of feudal castle and you largely navigate it by transforming into the little bird with the long beak who sticks his beak into the walls and then flicks himself around. I I love that character. I think that is a that is something that is good enough to be a a mechanic that carries a whole game. Yes, that's the the cliche about Mario Odyssey and it's said all the time. But I I think it's one of the transformations that gets the best showcase in the level. Like it's it's a lot of these great long walls that you have to navigate by sort of pinging yourself around and then sticking your beak back in and there are these giant bombs that you use your beak on like a little pull cue to kind of knock into a different direction and I feel like it's a a real showcase for the you know, the relationship between that that little bird and the particular gauntlet they've built, which isn't entirely true of other places It's it's a different kind of platforming, you know, it's not technically well it's sort of jumping, but it's sort of flinging yourself around, but I find that it is one of the more acrobatic and athletic levels. Mariodice maybe isn't like the best platforming showcase of all the Mario games because it's so much about abilities and like vibes of being in a place. I love the seaside level also. New Donk City I think is like the big crowd pleasing pick from this, but as an actual interesting jumping challenge Uh I think Bowser's Kingdom is the one for me.

Samuel
01:48:40
Yeah, I mean I've not played this level, um, but I know um these two Siccos have played Marijuana Sea. Um Ash, what do you make of this one?

Ash
01:48:47
The thing that Matthew was saying about The cliche of Mario Odyssey is that it has these mechanics that could hold up an entire game. Whenever anyone says that about Mario Odyssey This is the thing I think of in my head. Is that is that bird like flinging itself up the wall and sticking its its beak in? I would legitimately play a a 12-hour game of of just that.

Matthew
01:49:11
I would legitimately play a four out of ten Sega game built around that.

Ash
01:49:18
Are you referring to anything in particular?

Samuel
01:49:20
Basically everything that Matthew played on the uh Switch Online Services Mega Drive library is being slammed there. Um Um Yeah, uh that's uh Yeah, that's that is funny. Um Dave, what about you? Do you know you familiar with this one?

Matthew
01:49:34
You I thought you played through this game for it.

Samuel
01:49:35
Yeah, yeah, I've played through this game.

Dave Scarborough
01:49:36
I uh there's not really much to add what everyone else said. It's super super inventive, uh great fun. Uh you know, I'd to put the dad hat on, grown. Um it's it's just something as well that's so simple to pick up for the for children to understand. And it's like, you know, I've given this to my daughter to play and she's just got it and it's She just likes the traversal of like just just traversing around, not necessarily even like moving towards the objective. It's just it's it's got s it's something so sticky about it for all ages, and that's like the true Nintendo magic, right? So Yeah, it's great.

Ash
01:50:08
Dave Dave, is the dad hat a power in Mario Odyssey that I've completely forgotten?

Matthew
01:50:14
That's where Mario takes over your dad.

Samuel
01:50:22
Okay, it's time to move on. Matthew next pick.

Matthew
01:50:24
I'm gonna crack open free pick. I'm gonna take now I don't know what the rules are around this series. Um, you know, we established the rules at the outset, so I d I don't know what the correct version is, but I'm gonna take a hitman level. I'm gonna take it from what is now called Hitman World of Assassination, so the third iteration so it has all the mechanics from all the different hitman games. I'm gonna take my beloved Hokkaido. Oh yeah Nice. We can debate it well we have literally done episodes where we discussed Two. We did two episodes about it. Discuss the the ranking of these episodes. I think everyone knows that I love Hokkaido. It obviously isn't like the the huge sort of regional showcase that Sapienza is, but I really like the focus on costumes being like the door cards that get you deeper into the facility, the idea that different uniforms. give you access and that you sort of punt through from this luxury hotel spa into this elite medical facility. I you know, I I think it's one of the the tighter actual you know stealth challenges across all the three of those hitman games. It's got some of the most inventive kills. Uh it's got the famous kill where You leave the level with your target technically alive, but they're doomed to die just because you've fucked up the operation that they were gonna have. You've ki you've destroyed the heart, basically. I think there's something so sinister and and dark about sort of I don't even have to kill you, you're already dead, and that being the sort of sentiment as you leave the level and it that's always really stuck with me as as like a an absolute malicious highlight of everything Io did with these three games. So Hokkaido it is. I don't know if that means someone else can pick a different Hitman level in an a in a different Hitman?

Samuel
01:52:09
Who knows? But um Uh I think we just say that we've taken the Hitman trilogy off the board because I think they are kind of W it's one of the same mechanically, so I think that probably makes sense. And I also don't think anyone else was going to pick a hitman level. I might be wrong, but Ash Uh Dave, do you agree with that?

Dave Scarborough
01:52:27
It's not my pick from Hitman. I had it was also my wildcard. I I I g I like it's a it's a great it's great because Hitman like Hitman Free or Hitman World of Sassation is just it's it's an incredible game and everyone has their personal preference in terms of the type of game style they like or the type of aesthetic that particularly appeals to them for me. Death in the Family allows me to do sort of Miss Marple roleplay, which like I really enjoy about that. So I think it's I think it's a great pick. It just wouldn't be the one out of all of them I would go for, but I I do think it's pretty pretty faultless nonetheless.

Samuel
01:53:00
When we did the uh the ranking at the re-ranking a few years ago, um we put Paris at number one, Matthew, um Miami at number two. from Hitman 2 and Hokkaido at number three. But I think you might have put Hokkaido a bit higher in your personal ranking. So I know um I do agree it's a very classy level. and doesn't have I think we we all we're pretty much agreed that the canonical backpage take is that Sapienza's last objective, taking you to that one location and can only be only being done that one way makes it a weaker level even though the location itself is Fantastic. Like I think that's the right take. As time goes on, I think that stood the test of time as a take. Much as I like the little ice cream shop.

Matthew
01:53:39
Hokkaido might not be the number one level, but I'm I am so sure it's not sapienza. So

Dave Scarborough
01:53:45
That that much, I know. What's what's the Bat Page Pod take on uh Death in the Family? Where does that rank?

Samuel
01:53:51
Well I think we all agree that that was like really cool the first time you do it, but then when you do it again, you can't there's nothing to get out of the mystery the second time. Like once you've solved who'd done it. That's that's it, Dave. Do you know that do you that's fair criticism? I think so.

Dave Scarborough
01:54:04
Yeah yeah I that that is fair. I d I again like with any hit I like it's a cool location so I like doing the various different approaches to it, being a photographer, being the you know the Um the detective sold in the murder, like various different like angles to approach it from. But uh yeah, I get that. I but I I but then I probably have not played replayed those levels as much as you guys have.

Samuel
01:54:26
Oh man, anytime we talk about that these games, I just want to go play them again.

Matthew
01:54:29
They're so good.

Samuel
01:54:34
But it's back to Dave.

Dave Scarborough
01:54:36
I'm gonna go also in free pick. And I'm going to go with Metal Gear Solid 2 and I'm going to go with the tanker level at the start.

Samuel
01:54:49
Oh that was what I was gonna pick, you motherfucker! That's such a good pick. It's such a good pick. It's so good. Well done, dude.

Dave Scarborough
01:54:57
Yes, it's like this perfectly engineered stealth tutorial at the start. Um but I also what I've What I really love about it, and I'm I'm hit or miss with Kojima, but I think this is like him fully realizing his ambitions as sort of this cinematic storyteller in like in video games. It is like the a sort of fans, sort of like perfect imprint of what Solid Snake should be and what a what a Metal Gear Solid should be. And like the atmosphere, the weather effects, the uh the way the the the his like bandana just like floats in the wind, it's it's so good. And then obviously you get inside it. Uh like introducing all the new mechanics, like knocking out guards, dragging them into lockers, skulking around the the various different rooms in the ship. It's such uh A grandiose opening that just really nails like the fundamentals of what Metal Gear is about. And then it has like a pretty cool boss battle as well, like showcases the new first-person uh shooting mechanics. Um I can't remember the character's name, but you know, shooting her in the head as she slip. Solid snake? Propping out from cover. Not solid snake. It's not solid snake. Olga. Uh yes. Yeah Olga. Olga Golukovich, yeah. Uh but yes. Solid Snake. But yeah, this is this is so cool and this is like this is really just like what I think of Metal Gear, this is this is the first thing I think of The Harry Gregson Williams score as well is awesome. Just want to say that too.

Samuel
01:56:22
Well, it's only got little bits of sort of like I don't know, sort of ambient music of uh music that basically is perfectly conveys what it's like to come out of the rain. On a tanker and into some warmth and and just sort of like, but there are some lads poking around. Like the music captures that vibe so perfectly. But the reason I think this is an amazing pick is that I don't think there's any one space in video games where the player has been encouraged more to experiment with the mechanics. than this level in this game. It's so rich in that respect because every trailer they put out for Metal Gear Solid 2 was was dialing up the fact you could aim in first person, that you could shoot out guards radios and the, you know. There would just be all these you you would see the water the footprints um from Snake just in the corridors as he was walking around. Like they showed all that stuff off so you could you know the players were hyper aware of that Reactivity and then when they got that demo disc, they just played those bits over and over again to get the most out of that reactivity. And I think that's Why it's a true triumph and it only just exposes what a boring space the big shell is by comparison. It's nowhere near as interesting. Um despite the building blocks being the same, same mechanically, but it's just not None of the single individual struts are really that interesting in MGS2, but Tanker is great. Ash, what do you think of this pick?

Ash
01:57:44
Um yeah, I think I think this is a really smart pick, uh, mostly because As you say, like MGS2, like the the the bulk of it is this kind of these like this kind of spoke world that's a little bit grey and uninteresting and it's easy to forget. that there's that prologue there that like absolutely smashes it. This is gonna be quite a divisive thing to say, but I I remember thinking I wish the rest of the game was just like this bit, to be honest. Um, which I I think is, you know, whether you agree with that or not is testament to like how good that section is.

Samuel
01:58:19
Good stuff, Dave. Um we're all very proud of you. Um Ash, next pick.

Ash
01:58:24
Uh we we're dangerously close to me picking some bullshit that no one cares about.

Samuel
01:58:28
I thought we're about an hour past that.

Ash
01:58:31
We we hit that with half pipe. Well, okay, let's go for another Sonic game. Let's risk it. I think it's quite risky to pick two games in the same franchise. Uh but I absolutely love this boss battle. This this is a boss battle that made me gasp and cheer the first time I saw it. It's from Sonic Mania. And it's the Bosta Chemical Plant Act 2. And this is a moment where of course you fight Robotnik. but you are taken into quite unexpectedly a jewel of Doctor Robotnik's mean bean machine. Oh there we go. Samuel was typing it before I said it.

Samuel
01:59:10
Oh I knew. I knew what it was gonna be, obviously.

Ash
01:59:12
Which I I think i is is amazing for for a couple of reasons. Obviously it's this like really fresh and surprising thing after like decades of Sonic games like you you think you know what a Doctor of Botanic fight is about and then suddenly you're playing a completely different game against him and it's this like deep cut reference to to like an old Mega Drive game that's kind of forgotten, like Mean Bean Machine, for anyone who doesn't know, it was like a uh a Puyo Puyo game that was skinned with um characters from the Sonic cartoon. Um but Sonic Mania is the game that was made by Sonic fans rather than by Sonic Team. And as much as I love Sonic Team, I don't think they would have ever thought to do this because their mind would always be on. the future and looking at new things you c you can do with these characters that I don't think they would ever look back and like pull from the archives and go let's let's reference this this thing that's almost like uh uh like meme levels of of fandom, but also do it in in a way that's like re really fun and compelling and and and good to play. So I th I think so a really special moment and and it kind of I'm not sure it like holds up that well to replayability, but the first time it happens it's it's a real surprise that makes you like makes you admire the um the people behind it.

Samuel
02:00:34
Yeah, I think everything you said is correct that the it takes being an outsider to the the whole Sonic project for you to come up with an idea like this and um yeah it just bums me out there's no uh Sonic Mania too because crazy. Crazy. Yes. Why is that? I don't know. My personal feeling is that it was too good and they were scared of how good it was. Sonic is always bad these days.

Ash
02:00:58
S Sonic team made their own Sonic game in parallel at the same time, which is the the now largely forgotten Sonic Forces. I think there could be something to that. I think there might be a little bit of like corporate embarrassment maybe.

Samuel
02:01:10
Yeah. It's to but it's just a massive shame because it was Yeah, such incredible artistry went into it. It could have just been a rehash and it was much more than that. Great pick. Okay, comes back to me then. Uh got two picks. So First pick, gonna break open free pick as well. I'm gonna take the Clockwork Mansion in Dishonored 2, one of the greatest uh play spaces ever put in a video game. Had to pick a stealth game, I think, for this category because it's it's not represented anywhere else and Dishonored 2 has the best uh stealth mechanics and like precision to the first person mechanics more generally. A a mansion that where the rooms literally change by pulling switches and then the entire like room just kind of like flipping round and the layout just moving around and it's just this huge labyrinth for you to unpick. while these like terrifying but rad steampunk robots with swords come come after you. And I think like it takes like a few hours for you to really understand completely how it works and how to get the most out of it. But it's an amazing location to behold. Yeah, it's one of the the two uh Dishonored two levels um with a crack in the slab that have become like the immortalizing those best levels Everless. Um Matthew, what do you think of this pick?

Matthew
02:02:17
Yeah, I it's uh a a miracle of a level when you realise that it's kind of real and is actually happening and i it works as in not not it technically works, but you know, it works as a space and the what the concept of a level isn't being faked at all. It's you can really get to some weird ass places by slipping through the gap the gaps as it's moving and whatnot. Um yeah, it's it's like uh an unreal achievement that.

Samuel
02:02:43
Amazing stuff. So yep, that's um that's my free pick and uh yeah I think it's uh A 10 out of 10 game and yeah, my favourite level from that game personally. And uh next up, okay, so I'm not going to take a Sonic CD level or anything like that for platforming level. I'm going to counter program and take the shard, the final level from Mirror's Edge instead. Um, which is an unreal bit of first-person platforming and combat design. Um it's just this fucking massive building. The first shot of the level is you look up at this enormous skyscraper and then you're basically just sprinting around this like corporate labyrinth. And it's Everything Mirror's Edge does super well with like the best piece of music in the game, I think. Um it's on Spotify if you wanna go listen to it. It's just called the Shard, and it's just like it sums up the sort of dreamy, dystopian soundscape of that game more generally and ends with you jumping onto a helicopter and booting a guy out of it. It's just great stuff. Yeah, really good. Has that really difficult but really cool server room fight where if you're doing a no guns run, you basically have to get all the dudes in in the room to shoot at out these servers for you while you're sort of like frantically running out of the way. Just really good. I don't expect a any of you will remember this, but I play Mirror's Edge through like every three or four years and I thought Quite novel to like avoid picking a Mario or Sonic level and just go with something a bit different instead. That's that pick. Then we move on to Onto Ash.

Ash
02:04:08
Yeah, okay, so for a multiplayer game that's not an FPS, um, I'm gonna go with one of my favorites is Power Stone 2. by Capcom and I'm choosing the stage blue sky area. One of the great innovations of Power Stone 2 compared to the first one is that you have these like evolving stages that like dramatically changed as the as the fight went on. Uh and by the way, anyone who doesn't know Power Stone, it's kind of like 3D Smash Brothers. Uh 3D fighting game, uh four players in Power Stone 2, Chaos, weapons everywhere. And in Blue Sky area, you start off fighting on top of these like giant airships that are kind of moving around each other. There's cannons on top of the airships shooting at you. There's like an eagle that flies over the top and drops bombs on you. It's really crazy. And then suddenly these airships that you're standing on get completely destroyed and they give way. and you are like falling through the sky, like you know, falling without a parachute through the sky and still fighting as you fall. And then these these umbrellas uh will appear in the sky and you end up fighting over the umbrellas like it's like uh uh Looney Tunes. cartoon fighting over these brollies so that if you can grab one in time you will like safely like float to earth uh and not take any damage And then for the final part of the stage, like you you l you land in so almost like a traditional like Power Stone One stage with like lampposts that you can like swing around and fly off and do do like a karate kick. uh like a little river that's running through the level that you that you can get chucked into and that like that level alone is is like a really fun level. Like that that would in Power Stone 1, that would have been a perfectly good level all on its own. But in Power Stone 2 it's it's it's the culmination of this like really dramatic series of set pieces that I I think like really captures like the dynamism of this game that's like a little bit forgotten now, which might might count against me in in the draft. I don't know if there's people playing Power Stone 2 a lot, but it was recently re-released in a Capcom collection. So uh please everyone come out and play that before you decide who to vote for.

Matthew
02:06:24
You're not allowed to vote until you've played it It's like the Oscars. You have to watch all the best picture nominals before you can choose.

Ash
02:06:31
Have to play all of these levels.

Samuel
02:06:34
We've actually played this game, haven't we, Matthew? At this game where um you basically fuck get lads up by chucking boxes at them and um that's the entire game if I recall correctly. But at I think I do remember this level out of those. Like it's it it is like the multi-part structure of it is certainly memorable. I'm kind of up for that collection actually. I didn Did I enjoy it more than you, Matthew, would you say, Power Stone T?

Matthew
02:06:56
Yeah, I feel like we were both feeling our way through it and at the level we were playing at, which is zero expertise. uh we discovered that you could lock the other person in like a recovery animation by sort of chucking a box at them and it was that was what the game became so it w wasn't a great showcase for it. That did happen.

Samuel
02:07:17
That was a great afternoon when I brought the Dreamcast. round to you that was fun. Yeah okay good stuff Ash um we'll come back to Dave. Okay.

Dave Scarborough
02:07:24
How do we feel in terms of bonus level? With Star Wars Rogue Squadron the Death Star run. Because that's a bonus level after you unlock it later. What the fuck? Does that count?

Samuel
02:07:36
No, that's a secret that's a see that's a secret level, not a bonus level. I don't think that counts personally. It's bullshit. That's like an unl you have to unlock that by doing a bunch of bullshit. Like I I think that's it's therefore a bonus. I don't I I you know it' I I Matthew's chuckling.

Matthew
02:07:51
If there was a level where you flew through as many pineapples as you could in sixty seconds, that would be a bonus level.

Samuel
02:08:03
But it's just it also just has to be part of the main game experience, I think. Like it's yeah Yeah, I don't know. It's sort of like Yeah, you couldn't really count like the bowling minigame in Spider-Man the movie on Pierce 2, for example, Dave, even though it's got a bit of the old Bruce Campbell VO. It's not part of the game, mate, you know what I mean?

Dave Scarborough
02:08:21
Then you've left me no cho- you've left me no choice. I'm going to steal Street Fighter 2 car smash then.

Matthew
02:08:26
Oh fuck off. Yes! The podcast in gold. Why would you You know what? I think the Death Star's alright.

Dave Scarborough
02:08:38
I've long approved of the Emperor's policies towards Alderan. You left me no choice. I had to then take the best one on the board. It's the most iconic. I feel like we've all fallen into a trap here.

Matthew
02:08:50
But I don't I don't ha I don't have a backup.

Dave Scarborough
02:08:54
That feels like a real you problem right now, Matthew. If I'm gonna be honest.

Samuel
02:09:02
I thought we'd get to the end of this and be like, oh, wasn't it nice we didn't do it for once? But no. No. Why wouldn't I take this? What am I getting like there's this or the half pipe from Sonic Two? I think this might be the best pick in the draft in the sense that there is no better bonus stage than this. It's all like whatever's left over. But Dave, you're not worried about the damage that Matthew's going to do to you now off the back of this. I think you respect it. I think it's great podcasting and that's all I care about ultimately, but you know.

Dave Scarborough
02:09:30
I I think it it has to be admired. And honestly, it was your first was it your first pick? It's a target.

Matthew
02:09:36
It's a target.

Dave Scarborough
02:09:37
And like honestly, it's a tough category.

Samuel
02:09:39
Well, Jesus Christ, I mean it's now m Matthew's turn. He's got two turns now. Remember, Matthew, you have to use a kill token at the start of a turn.

Matthew
02:09:49
Thing is, I want to kill Mario Galaxy, but then then Mario Galaxy 2 exists. Mario Galaxy 2 does exist. And that so that kinda makes that feel a bit redundant.

Dave Scarborough
02:09:56
MGS2 tanker sitting right there. Don't look, this is it. You can't gang up on me because I made a strong strategic decision.

Samuel
02:10:03
You know, this is You c you could have taken Death Star in free pick, Dave, and you took Tanker instead. Hey, don't you try and kill Tanker because you wanted it. Hey, I'm killing I'm staying out of it. I'm letting you boys resolve this among yourselves.

Matthew
02:10:17
Let's all put calm heads on. That bonus level thing is a nightmare because I really I really don't have a backup. I couldn't think of one. Sam will attest to the fact that I was sort of sounding him out about the shape of that category, because that was me being stuck.

Samuel
02:10:33
Maybe we should litigate the one that you mentioned, Matthew, which was uh I'm curious to know what Ash thinks of this, but is the Resident Evil 4 target gallery a bonus stage? What do you think, Ash? I don't know if I call it a stage.

Ash
02:10:45
Well yeah, you like controlling Leon. It it's kind of mini-game as much as it is bonus stage.

Samuel
02:10:52
Yes what I thought Yeah, it's tough because that would otherwise be the best one I think. 'Cause it just uses the excellent core shooting mechanics of the case.

Matthew
02:11:00
But that's the thing, you don't yes, it it's it's embedded in the game, but it is a m it's a mini game using the core mechanics

Samuel
02:11:10
Oh fuck off Dave. We all read that same game as radar list, didn't we? And it was like, oh, there are no good ones. Fucking hell.

Matthew
02:11:18
Oh, that is um That is that's quite a pickle for.

Ash
02:11:23
Lots of other Sonic games still to be picked.

Matthew
02:11:26
Oh but they're all dreadful.

Samuel
02:11:28
Uh oh God Oh, this is so good. Well done Dave. I'm assuming the podcast needed. I mean that getting a bit too gentle there, wasn't it?

Matthew
02:11:38
I know you're gonna say I know you're gonna say no to this, but the side levels that you enter in split fiction, they're not bonus levels, are they?

Samuel
02:11:45
Oh, I think they are bonus levels. Yeah. Because they're part of the main game experience and they are optional mechanics. I think that passes the test.

Matthew
02:11:53
Oh! In which case, for bonus level, I'll take the collapsing star from Split Fiction. Well I think my favourite of the side stories, well it is my favourite of the side stories, which is why I've picked it. The classic little sci-fi adventure where you're walking towards a collapsing sun. as it sends out these great big waves of heat and you have to sort of hide in the shadows of things. I think it just sort of sells you on this huge sci-fi concept. Way more than it needs to. The fact that it's this little side level, you know, all the bespoke assets they have to make to actually sort of sell you on the idea the actual mechanic of hiding in the shadows. Okay, it isn't hugely complicated. But I think it like instantly settles you on the peril and in the journey, you know, close and close to the sun, it does like ramp up this intensity and it's just it's crazy that there's this Such a a different little tonal piece lodged in there. I mean all those side stories are are pretty great. I love the SSX one. There's one which is a little bit like Star Fox that I like those as well. But this one, we talked about this in in our like moments of the year last year in our in our awards because I think it it sort of jumped out to both of us. So Thank you for letting me take it in this category. I was worried it wouldn't count.

Samuel
02:13:05
Oh, it's actually a really smart thinking, because it is different to picking the target gallery and Dresden War 4. It's That's just one-to-one the same mechanics. Do you agree that Dave that that's a fair pick? Uh uh yeah.

Dave Scarborough
02:13:18
Yes. Absolutely. Yes. To to be

Samuel
02:13:22
A peacemaker in us. To get to stop Matthew to de-escalate Matthew killing one of your picks.

Matthew
02:13:27
Next pick, Matthew. Worst level and location I doom my worst enemy to live in. I am picking the Dead Baby Nightmare from Max Payne 1.

Samuel
02:13:37
That's great. I like that.

Matthew
02:13:38
In which Max Payne not only is to navigate an incredibly shitty level, which is like running around blood trails. But it's a level that's all about a a child dying, so it's really horrible and there's a baby wailing in the background. It's a really confusing maze, and your reward for doing the really confusing maze is a man learns something absolutely dreadful's happened to him. It's it's just an all-time bummer of a level. Uh it came up recently on the Watch podcast, weirdly, they ended up talking about this and I it just reminded me of like Wow, this thing must have really stuck with these quite casual gamers, this this sort of foul level. So um yeah, that is a level I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to live in. Who is Dave? Everyone's worst enemy. I know why.

Samuel
02:14:27
See also um uh same genre, house Benaviento with a giant baby in the basement. You can have Dave moving there, Matthew. That would be um you have to like go live in a little room in there, that's not ideal. Um that's gonna be it's a it's a great iconic bit of that game, but yeah, it's a it's a good pick for this. It's it's a it's an interesting little kind of like step on the road of people figuring out how to do emotional storytelling in video games, right? And um Yeah, and Max Payne's very noir-ish, heightened way of doing things meant that that was the kind of genius way they came up with it. And yes, it's not a great level, despite that, but yeah. Good stuff. Well, you didn't kill anything or steal anything, Matthew, which is intriguing. Um so we move on to Dave again.

Dave Scarborough
02:15:09
I'm going to go Just to cool the temperatures of the room. Um mission in an open world large game. I'm gonna go with uh the forest temple in Ocarina of Time. This I think like when you think of like the the scope of temples in in Zelda or in Ocarina, this one has like an unmatched atmosphere. It's super weird. It's like this sort of almost like this twisted nightmare of an experience. As you get into it, you've got the the the rooms that that literally are twisting as you as you sort of walk down them. You have the amazing phantom ganum fight at the end, you've got the floating pose that are constantly terrorizing you. But even like within the puzzles, you know, you've got some really like great combat challenges. You've got the skeletons, the skeletons with the sword and the shield. Stalfos. Stalfos, thank you. Uh those jewels are actually proper combat tests uh at that stage in the game Yeah, it's it's one of the trickier puzzle dungeon dungeons, even. Various multiple levels, you've got the different flames in the middle that you have to light in order. It gets better as it goes along and culminates in that in that great iconic boss fight at the end. So uh yeah, I'll go for this one. It's the best temple in the game, I think, and I I I don't think that's a controversial thing to say. Don't know. Spirit temple is pretty good. I was tempted with that with the time shift mechanic, you know jumping between young Link and Old Link to to complete it, but this one I have more nostalgia for for sure.

Matthew
02:16:31
My mind did go to Zelda Dungeons for this category, but I I actually struggled to hone it down to like this is this is the pick. because A no one can agree what the best Zelda is and B within each Zelda no one can agree what the best dungeon is. So I I found like it a bit of a maddening task. Uh I it's definitely a good one, whether it's technically the best one here. I'm a bit I am a Water Temple apologist.

Ash
02:16:56
All the levels I like best in Ocarina of Time, I'm paranoid are the ones that people hate. So I love the Water Temple and I love Jabu Jabu's belly.

Dave Scarborough
02:17:03
I hate Jabu Jabu's belly. That is so frustrating though. Also, I find it disgusting. It's like it's like you're navigating around someone's like internal cysts. You know, it's just something so gross about it.

Samuel
02:17:15
Level set in my belly by the sounds of it. Let's move on to Asher's next pick then. Sounds like a draw for Dave there.

Ash
02:17:20
So for free pick, I thought I had a really killer uh choice for this. And then I just googled it and found that this particular location is split over four chapters of a very, very popular game. I thought I can't that's gonna be too controversial because uh you'd I'd have to pick one quarter of it.

Samuel
02:17:39
Let's listen to gate. What is the game? What is the pick?

Ash
02:17:42
Uh the game is on charter two and I was thinking of the the train.

Samuel
02:17:45
Oh I had that. I think that's fine. Really? Are you saying that it it it's from when Elena chucks you onto the train right up until where the train derails? Is that what you basically say?

Ash
02:17:54
I think for for me I would want to include the the running along the train as it's moving. Right. Uh and the train like hanging from from the cliff and you climbing up it. But they're they're like two different chapters. But for for me, like what works about the train is how versatile it is as a space and how many how it it it it you get the platforming and the climbing out of it, you also get the the running and gunning from it. Like it does everything, but I think I feel like I'm cheating.

Samuel
02:18:25
I think I think it would it would be allowed if you had it from when you first board the train. to when the train is derailed. But I wouldn't I wouldn't allow you to have the bit where he's climbing up the train. The the bit that loops from the opening. What do you think, Matthew?

Matthew
02:18:38
I think they I I think they just there there is that split. I think they are two levels, uh sadly.

Ash
02:18:43
I think it's better than the other pick I've got.

Samuel
02:18:46
Well, that's still like an amazing chunk of that game. I like I I see I would call that the train level, you know.

Ash
02:18:51
I think it's the best bit of the best uncharted game.

Samuel
02:18:54
Well, that's not true, but it's uh you know it's interesting. It's the It's like the it's one of the top like it's probably the best moment of an uncharted game, I think. That uh best overall set piece, you know.

Ash
02:19:04
Alright, well I've talked it up now, so we might as well go with it.

Samuel
02:19:07
So good they ripped it off in Captain America the First Avenger two years later.

Matthew
02:19:10
So um well so good that they did it again in Lost Legacy.

Samuel
02:19:13
Yeah, exactly. That's as good as only a PS3 ever got that bit. Uh so yeah, good good stuff. Okay, comes back to me then for two picks. Uh nearing the end here. I'm going to take for category four multiplayer level, can't be an FPS, a rainbow road from last year's Mario Kart World. Which is the most perhaps the most visually amazing thing Nintendo has ever created. It's like a it's just a an amazing sense of of scale and detail to it. It's just the about as uh 2001 a Space Odyssey as Mario ever has ever got. And it's just one of those things where people told me, they alluded to me that it was gonna be like i uh impressive but then you You shoot up into the sky, into space, and it's just like, this is fucking unbelievable. Like lights out good. And also Khrushchev like doesn't feel compromised by the the linked together nature of the tracks throughout the game, which does give the tracks, even the returning ones, a certain sort of like unusual pace to a few of them. You know, the fact that you you are sort of driving between them like that.

Ash
02:20:13
I think it's quite the opposite. It's the it it's the moment for me that justifies that that game mechanic because the w the way you enter that stage is that is true cool.

Samuel
02:20:22
That is true, but it does sort of live off by itself relative to the rest of it, you know? Yeah, but it is just unbelievable. And like Sometimes, uh, you know, I think Rainbow Road in any Mario Kart game is always visually impressive, but to me it's not always an amazing track. Sometimes it's just like Oh, it's that pain in the dick track that looks amazing. Um but um here I would say it was just, yeah, it was this is I I properly I just sat there and was like bravo at the end of it basically, just absolutely amazing. And I uh Yeah, I look forward to doing it again um at some point um when playing through this uh some more while on the go.

Dave Scarborough
02:20:55
But it's so annoying, you can't pick it like from from the track list just to play in isolation. You have to do it Unless I've like unless they've changed that. You can't just pick it and play it in multiplayer, local multiplayer or anything.

Samuel
02:21:07
Well I'm glad it's so well regarded, 'cause I wondered this being so a recent a pick, if it might be a bit you might be a bit cooler on it. But Ash, it sounds like you dug this as well. It's good. Yeah, it's really good. No notes. Good stuff. Okay, time for my bonus level. I like the swirly nonsense in Sonic the Hedgehog 1 actually. And so I will be taking that. Do do do do do do do Now can you only control Sonic with about 75% accuracy? Yes. But Is it easier than those fucking pipe puzzle half pipe puzzles? Yes, it is. So, um, it goes in. I do think that it's iconic as a bit of like sonic imagery and mega drive imagery, even if you think it's bullshit. Um Ash, what do you think of that?

Ash
02:22:15
Yeah, I uh I don't I don't want to be unkind. Like it is it is my least favourite of of all of the Sonic bonus stages, but it is it is still fun and it's got I think it's got a bit more depth and challenge to it than my pick and I shouldn't say that. I've shot myself in the foot. It's like it's like playing inside a kaleidoscope. It's uh it's definitely got a bit of um a bit of trippiness to it.

Samuel
02:22:41
You're a bit c you're quite A bit kinder to it there than I thought you'd be, but um yeah. I mean you know it's a it's a tough category, uh this more generally, so um that's fine. Okay then we move Batash.

Ash
02:22:52
Worst level I do my worst enemy to live in. My top pick for this is a is a level I absolutely love and I don't think it's a bad level, but I wouldn't want to be trapped in this. So we'll we'll sit we'll see how this goes. If you think it's bullshit. then um I've got some other choices. But my top pick is the fourth stage of Parappa the Rapper. Where you're queuing for the toilet.

Samuel
02:23:16
I love that. That's great.

Ash
02:23:18
And you have to. So I I like to imagine that I've damned my worst enemy. To this situation where they are absolutely busting for a wee or maybe a poo, but to get to the one and only toilet, they have to rap with a frog, a moose, and an onion. to get there. Uh and I I think that'd just be infuriating. You probably just piss your pants to be honest.

Matthew
02:23:42
I don't know if I want to see my enemy like pissing themselves as like a paper cutout uh in an em game.

Samuel
02:23:51
I've got nothing else to add. That's uh that's what I've got. I know Matthew would consider that a bad game because it's a PlayStation 1 game and Matthew's not fond of those, um, but um a Sony first party one um to boot. Um but uh yeah I think that's a a good pick. I have nothing to add either. Um and so we move on to Dave's next pick.

Dave Scarborough
02:24:07
I've got two left. I've got Worse level, I won't do my enemies to live in and first person shooter multiplayer. Okay, I'll go with worst level. I've had to think about this while we've been talking. Um because what originally what I was gonna go with when I was thinking more of like just a i an incredibly cursed location, but in another ice good game. I was speaking of Lavender Town in Pokemon. Um but I'm not gonna go for that. Oh that's a good one. Yeah but it doesn't really fit the category. Um so I'm going to go with the house from PT. Oh, that's great. Well done. That's awesome. Because from mechanically, you can't fucking escape it. I never completed it. I don't know who here did. Uh but I did. I did.

Samuel
02:24:53
You just have to say Jareth. You have to say Jareth. You have to have to say my guy Jareth. Just say it into the headset and then you get a lead.

Dave Scarborough
02:24:59
It didn't work for me. I went I went in so many circles of that fucking house, uh that corridor. Genuinely terrifying. The jump scare is um the worst one I've ever experienced in gaming. Like I I'm sure I've told this story on the podcast before. that I found it s too intense, so intense that I ended up m streaming it to my PS Vita to play on the small screen. and I put Mrs. Doubtfire on on the television so I had some levity in the background because I found the whole experience too too troubling and and unnerving uh sat in my lounge.

Samuel
02:25:32
I wanna believe that Kojima hacked your copy of Mrs. Doubtfire so he starts going Ooh, don't turn around, dearie. Don't turn around.

Matthew
02:25:39
Ooh jar. Ooh jar.

Dave Scarborough
02:25:42
Instead of throwing like an orange up his bros and throwing throwing the fucking fetus from the sink at him. So uh so yeah, genuinely th the the most haunted, cursed, unnerving, terrified environment you could possibly find yourself in just this this like never-ending corridor of ghosts and and truly disturbing imagery that you can't escape. And when you do escape you just see uh a B-tier television actor.

Samuel
02:26:12
Uh all brutal. I mean that's a I think that's a great pick, Dave. Um no one will dispute that that's like a bad place to live. Um so I think it fulfills the criteria. Perfectly. Matthew, it comes back around to you for two picks.

Matthew
02:26:24
I'm slightly regretting picking an actually shit level for worst level because I f I feel like the others are bad places but are probably better levels anyway For mission in an open world or larger game, I'm going to take a level from the Witcher 3, Hearts of Stone. Dead Man's Party. Which three Hearts of Stones, the expansion where you you basically make a deal with the devil and you have to complete these tasks that turn out to be well seemingly impossible, and one of them is to show this guy called Vlodimir a good time, you know, one last g good day on Earth, but the twist is that he's already died. Um so it should be impossible, but what they actually do is they Geralt lets this Vlodomir possess him and then you do this questline as as sort of possessed Geralt. who goes to this big party that's being thrown you know, you have to do all these party activities, you uh you hang out with your sidekick, and by showing this guy like one last good day on earth, he he basically sort of sort of sees the error of his ways in in certain ways, but it's a absolute like towering comic performance from Doug Cockle as as Geralt, 'cause it's sort of Geralt as someone else. very sort of sassy and this you can hear this other voice kind of coming up through his voice. It's just a brilliant bit of writing. Basically loads and loads of ox patting in this this quest 'Cause it's just going to a party and and having fun, but I think it's so different to anything else in that game, but still very, very poignant. It could be an episode of a TV show, just that questline Geralt's weird party, so

Samuel
02:28:05
Uh yeah, I'm picking that. Nice. Instead they made a a really bad Twitcher TV show that got worse as it went along and um it just squandered its potential. That was tough. Um yeah, um I I think it's g you know totally valid to get an RPG quest in here like we discussed and um otherwise it's just too limiting to have to pick like oh yeah I went to an outpost and killed some guys in Far Cry four or whatever. It's just not very um

Matthew
02:28:27
I I contemplated the the climbing like the ascent up to the wind temple in Tears of the Kingdom where you're kinda climbing through the clouds um in the snowy kingdom, just 'cause it's so cinematic and so epic, but You know, Tears of the Kingdom and this podcast have a complicated relationship, so Pearls before swine with our listeners.

Samuel
02:28:53
pick Matthew. Well not our guests, our listeners.

Matthew
02:28:57
For boss battle. There's so many good boss battles. You could go in so many different directions. I think we've got a very technical boss fight with the end, a very high concept boss fight with Mean Beam Machine, and a classic bit of Souls business um with Dark Souls. So I'm gonna pick Something quite dumb, something quite AAA and shiny. I'm gonna take a God of War boss. I think this is a a great bit of spectacle. I'm actually gonna take the first boss fight from God of War 2017 against Boulder or the Stranger as he is then, when he turns up at your house. It's arguably more of a tutorial of like everything you've learned about the combat system up until that point. But it was the moment in the game where I was properly solved on the unbroken over-the-shoulder camerawork because This guy unl he he basically unleashes your first taste of godlike power on you and he's smashing you through trees and rocks. you get a little glimpse of like uh oh there's still something to this Kratos of the old Kratos. It it was the moment where I properly locked into twenty seventeen and was like, yeah this is this is brilliant. I'm so glad that they've done it in this way. There are ten brilliant boss fights I could pick across the God of War series, but I just thought this this was this was really spectacular at the time.

Samuel
02:30:21
Yeah, I mean um I don't remember that many moments from this, but I remember the the fight with Thor Either in the second one or this one. The second one. And this fight.

Matthew
02:30:30
Yeah. They sort of do the same trick in Ragnarok where Thor turns up right at the start and then you you sort of start on a high.

Samuel
02:30:37
Yeah, it's it is very impressive. I think even if the technical like excellence of it is sort of why you're picking it. Like the actual as a narrative device it's really it's really great because it does set the stakes so high. It's kind of like Your time in exile is over, Kratos. Like we know that you're here and you're and you're fucked, basically, which is a really great way to kick off that story. So I like this. It is good counter programming, Matthew, I think. And uh it's it's a moment that I'm sure pretty much all of our listeners will have played at some point.

Matthew
02:31:08
So

Samuel
02:31:08
Yeah. And thank you for not stealing the end. That's the important thing, really. Um I just don't feel like uh malice is the theme of this podcast, this this draft. I agree. There's something about something s it's a bit more sincere. When you're picking levels, it's a bit more like I don't know, when we do the N sixty four GameCube draft, I bet the kills and steals will come back into fashion again, but I agree it's a bit It's okay for it to be a bit cooler. That said, it's not over yet. So um we come to you, Dave Scarborough. My last pick. Yep

Dave Scarborough
02:31:41
You're just setting me up to try to kill something now, aren't you? Like that's just no I didn't say anything.

Samuel
02:31:46
Just pick something, then it's over, you're done. This is a guy trying to talk himself into killing something. I just so modi. He's like, there's not enough chaos. I just wanna see the world burn. My last category is multiplayer shooter. Well that's a great category. That's a good one to go.

Dave Scarborough
02:32:00
Save the best to a last. Do I I get a go after I've done the kill though, right? A kill then go. You it goes yeah, what happens in the same turn. I'm gonna kill Ash's Titanfall 2 pick. And I'm gonna pick for first person shooter level. Uh multiplayer the dust two from Counter Strike.

Samuel
02:32:22
A classic. I know nothing about it, but except that it's a classic.

Dave Scarborough
02:32:25
We talked about Umrup Tournament and how the map designing of of that was just like foundational to to the modern shooter. Dust2 is the evolution of that. This is modern multiplayer shooter map design. in its like most like purest essence. It is is absolutely perfect in terms of it's instantly readable. You have these long stretches, you've got these tight corridors, you've got these very various different routes that you can go that are perfect for different playstyles. So, you know, if in the start in the counter-terrorist starting zone, you immediately go right and there's like this tiny sliver of a gap between these two double doors. And then from the terrorist side If you're a skilled sniper and you're looking straight down through these various different tunnels, you can see into that gap. And if so if someone goes past, if you're a crack shot, you can get your first headshot and your first kill of the match immediately. Then on the left side from the terrorist uh starting point, you go down into this sort of like this this sort of little in i inside area and that leads to the to the second to the to bombside B. And again, you're getting really close combat s where people are throwing their smoke grenades, their flashbangs, you're getting some really intense, like up-close action occurring. And then yeah, it's just I I dunno, I'm not doing it justice. It just is this per like the most perfectly balanced map design of any multiplayer game. There's a reason why. Counter-Strike has map rotations that are just to dust too because it's it's perfect. It's never been bettered. I honestly could picked like a whole bunch of different maps from Counter-Strike. Like I love Office Uh the original De Dust is great, malicious fantastic, but Didust 2 is is perfection in multiplayer map design. And so like it had it had to be my number one choice. And I spent so many years playing Counter-Strike. I fucking loved this game. And this is the map. If I'm booting up like Counter-Strike 2 when it came out When Source came out, when uh Global Offensive came out, the Dust Two's the first one you start on to really test the game out to see if it still has that pull, to still see how if it still has that weight and that responsiveness that you that you remember. you always go to this map as a starting point. Fantastic, ten out of ten.

Samuel
02:34:38
I mean it is nice to hear you talk about this this kind of um multiple play FPS games because it is it is one of your specialty areas and we've never had much excuse to talk about it on the podcast.

Dave Scarborough
02:34:47
I've been campaigning for the Valve episode. I'm like I'm I'm your guy, you know

Samuel
02:34:51
Instead we did a fucking Ghostbusters episode though, which is you know it's a good thing. Tough decisions all around there. It was it was difficult that. Um that's a good pick, and you know, not something the rest of us can really speak to, I don't think, but it's um I know it's it's pretty much Number one of everyone's list of the best multiplayer FPS maps ever. I'd certainly learn that this week. So um good stuff. Um but obviously you killed uh Ash's level, so Uh well, some shit's kicking off and so we come back to Ash. I just want everyone to remember how I was before how I ended. Well, but you you almost got out of Here with tanker in tax.

Dave Scarborough
02:35:28
I'm a man of the way what they what they what drama!

Samuel
02:35:32
And I know Ash is fucked because he doesn't play first-person shooters. So I had to take Titanform 2 off him to see what he does. Oh, you should take You should take Villa in Perfect Dark Ash, that level's a banger. What's your next pick?

Ash
02:35:43
I I am truly fucked. Uh 'cause I I had I had two picks for FPS single player. Uh and the other one was golden eye. Yeah, it's it's off the board. You could steal it. Um so I'm uh you could.

Dave Scarborough
02:35:57
Be fun, do it.

Ash
02:35:59
No, I can I can't steal it because it was taking in multiplier.

Dave Scarborough
02:36:01
Didn't we decide we can move them over? Just it had to be the same level.

Ash
02:36:04
No, no. No. That's what we didn't decide, Dave. That's what you decided not to do. Um so I'm gonna have to come back to singleplayer, first person shooter, once I've done some furious googling. I am gonna have to have my revenge, I'm afraid, because that was Appalling behavior even by your terrible standards day. Truly, truly vile behaviour. So yeah, I'm killing Tanka.

Samuel
02:36:32
Oh, you hate to see it, Dave. Why, Dave?

Ash
02:36:36
You were the chosen one, Dave. I I was honest at the higher ground I was planning to get through this entire draft without a steal or a kill. You force my hand.

Matthew
02:36:46
We learnt nothing from House of Dynamite.

Ash
02:36:49
Neutral issue and destruction.

Samuel
02:36:52
Okay, um and so that's dead. What are you gonna pick Ash?

Ash
02:36:55
So while while I think about single player FPS, multiplayer Halo FPS, uh oh there, I've giv I've given the game away. Halo. Uh I'm gonna go Halo Oh god, I'm really torn. There's loads of great maps in Halo. Um I really considered Hang'em High. I really considered Battle Creek, which I think is a fantastic, like tiny level uh that really suits like the the low number of players you would have had on Halo 1. But I am of course gonna go with Blood Gulch uh which is the definitive Halo map. Uh Dave says I don't like first person shooters. I like two first person shooters. I like Goldeneye and I like Halo.

Matthew
02:37:32
Because the these were um

Ash
02:37:34
These were local multiplayer experiences, split screen multiplayer largely. Uh but actually Halo came out uh when I was at uni. Um and I was sharing a room with with a uh housemate at university and we both had an Xbox each linked up by a LAN cable so we'd play like full screen uh deat match against each other. Occasionally we get some other people involved a as well. And Blood Gulture was was the the one like Uh I really liked the the small maps in Halo, but the big maps allowed you to uh to go away and like hide for ages uh and and snipe on people. Uh and it had the warthogs in the level, so for someone who had pretty much gone from Goldeneye to Perfect Dark to Halo, like having those vehicles inside a multiplayer map and being able to like tear shit up and like basically like run over people. Um was just like hours and hours of hilarious fun. Yeah, had a fantastic time with Blood culture.

Samuel
02:38:34
It's fucking amazing and uh it's all of the the sandbox promise of Halo at once with all those rad vehicles and the physics and everything. It's uh it's Great stuff. Comes back to me for my final pick. Davis uses kill and steal and cannot fight back. Um so I'm going to kill uh Ravenholm um for Half Life Two. Um eat shit, Dave. You can't do anything, mate. You've

Dave Scarborough
02:38:57
you know you you did this to yourself I've got loads of choices loads of choices in that category.

Samuel
02:39:02
You chock the bomb at you know Art Duke Ferdinand's uh car um and now it's war in Europe mate. So I hope you're proud of you. Why are you attacking me?

Dave Scarborough
02:39:09
You're neutral

Samuel
02:39:11
Because you've used your kill and steal, so there's no consequence to me doing it.

Dave Scarborough
02:39:15
It's just uh it's just- I'm the only one with the balls to entertain your audience. This is the thanks I get.

Matthew
02:39:20
Let's salt the earth so nothing will ever grow again.

Samuel
02:39:24
I should be commended for my behaviour, not punished. Uh well I I I do think it you know, again, the kill and steel tokens have done their job. They brought some drama to the podcast when it was It should be simmering down as we all prepare to go to bed after three hours of recording.

Dave Scarborough
02:39:39
I'm the one who's up at half five and I'm full of gas.

Samuel
02:39:42
Uh okay. Alright, worst level and location I doom my worst enemy to live in. Davis Garber, you now live in um Bavel Temple in Final Fantasy X, the cloister of trials. You have to ride these little Oh never know what that is. It's like a puzzle where you have to r glide along these sort of like floating platforms. moving spheres from one side to the other and it's total fucking bullshit because you have all these conveyors moving in different directions where you can fall into an abyss and then the whole thing reset. Or you haven't turned things the right way, so you end up going in like circles, never making any progress, trapped in there for about two and a half hours to eventually just look up a guide and go Get me the fuck out of here. What were you thinking, Squaresoft Circa 2001? So that's where you live now, Dave. And um I know that the Final Fantasy X heads in the Discord will agree with me that this is bullshit. And probably quite a good pick for this category. Well done. Yeah, and so I think it's Ash's turn.

Ash
02:40:36
Uh and I was seriously thinking of stealing Hyde. I knew you were gonna do so.

Dave Scarborough
02:40:39
Actually that worked out great, because I know I can pick still.

Ash
02:40:44
Okay, so I fig I've figured this out. I don't think this is gonna win me the draft, but I'm gonna go with an Ashley Day heart pick, which is the opening level from the two thousand and six version of Prey. uh which uh is a it's a largely forgotten game now but I absolutely love this game. Like it's it's kind of in like that post Half-Life 2 uh mode where developers were trying to blend like narrative and and first person shooters together. There's not that m there's not actually that much shooting in the opening stage. Like you start off In a bar, there's a little bit of a bar room brawl, you can interact with with things, you can you walk over to the jukebox, put the jukebox on, and um by default it's playing like Don't Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult. Um so it's like dripping with atmosphere. Um I think if I remember correctly, like I think there's some sort of like plot where he's like broken up with his girlfriend, so some stuff going on with that and he's he's trying to uh get back together with her. And then like you are abducted by aliens and like beamed up uh to this spaceship and like away you go. You're on this like crazy adventure with portals portals year b years before portal itself came out and I I just remember thinking this was just like a really like kick-ass way to open a first-person shooter like dripping with atmosphere, uh established a sense of place, a sense of character. You're playing as like a Native American character which is uh really quite an unusual choice and then like bang you're in space you're on a spaceship where you can like walk on the ceiling crazy stuff happens This really like left an impression on me, this game. I don't know if it left an impression on many other people, uh, but it did me.

Samuel
02:42:30
Wild pick. a classic Ashley Day pick and that I never saw it coming um around a genre that I don't yeah I don't consider your heartland necessarily but uh I do respect it. It's uh it's yeah it's certainly an interesting game from an era where the 360 was getting a load of these like mid noughties PC FPS games that you hadn't really seen on console before. So yeah, good stuff. Dave, it's your pick again. Have you got you got pick two games now, haven't you? I do, yeah.

Dave Scarborough
02:42:57
I think for free pick, I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with the house from Resident Evil 7. I think when it comes to iconic levels when it comes to areas that are dripping with atmosphere, sort of oozing with tension and and like that unpredictability that anything could happen, like one of the Family members could just like burst through a wall at any moment. Like when you're when you're sort of trying to navigate your escape, you just don't know like whether through that door someone's gonna pop out and catch you. Um it all goes obviously absolutely bonkers when they like turn into giant monsters, but for like the longest time it becomes this like incredible area of like tension on horror and unpredictability And it just it just gets under your skin in a way that I don't think many horror games have managed to do. Like I I was contemplating the police station for Resident Evil 2, which may arguably be more iconic overall, but I think actually in terms of, you know the horror of it, the actual scare factor, ri the the house of Resident Evil Seven is outmatched.

Ash
02:44:00
I've got a call bullshit on this Dave. Utter bullshit. The amount you protested over me having Peach's And it was allowed. And you and your and your pick for Resident Evil 7 is like eighty-five percent of the entire game.

Samuel
02:44:13
No, no, no. Just the just the main house. Fuck. He's c he's kinda right, uh Dave, but it's also past the three hour mark and I I want to go to bed. So I'm gonna let you have it.

Ash
02:44:23
I just wanted to note that for the record that this is bullshit.

Samuel
02:44:26
It is bullshit, Dave, but you've been through a lot in this draft. Um admittedly because of your own behaviour, but nonetheless. Um Maffie could kill it. Leave me scrap stranded It's true, but uh I mean we'll see. Matthew, it's your final pick.

Matthew
02:44:41
I think I'm just too much of a good guy to use these these vicious tokens.

Samuel
02:44:45
This is a you really you should go into PR. You think about this stuff a lot I think, like how you come across, how you're perceived. You're very good at this.

Matthew
02:44:52
I I I like that this was a s this was a mostly civil draft. For my so my last pick I've got is Light Gun Stage. I'm not necessarily ending on a high here, but I am ending on something that I I I do genuinely like. I'm going to take the Raccoon City Police Department from Resident Evil The Dark Side Chronicles. Which of course re envisions Resident Evil 2 and Code Veronica as light gun games in the same way that Resident Evil 1 was turned into a light gun game in the Umbrella Chronicles. I'm not gonna s pretend it it's it's like a world-class light gun shooter this, but I always like the exercise of taking the journey, the rough journey you take through the police station Resident Evil 2 and then turning it into a 20 minute light gun dash, so it's like all the drama compressed into a light gun level. I I think that's that's quite a a neat and you know, somewhat valuable way of of viewing uh these games again from a different perspective. And I think the police department is just a little bit more iconic than the things you get up to in Code Veronica, like another mansion which isn't quite as famous as the f Resident Evil One mansion, so it will have to be this. Um I can't pretend to be any expert in Time Crisis or House of the Dead, so Yes, Dark Side Chronicles it is. And I think that is me. Uh done.

Samuel
02:46:21
You done. Well done, Matthew. Okay, so back to you, Dave.

Dave Scarborough
02:46:24
Uh first person shooter, single player level. Two choices here. There's the Medal of Honor, Allied Assault, D-Day Landing, which I think is iconic obviously lifting directly from saving Private Ryan, but as a video game experience it conveyed that same level of like intensity, drama, raw emotion of it all. Really, really good. But I think It's a classic. It's cited so many times on these best of lists, and for good reason, it sort of was one of the defining levels of Call of Duty when it reinvented itself with COD 4. Which is all gillied up. You play out as sort of fan you play as sorry fan favourite COD character, Captain Price, the guy with the big mustache. And really what what sort of differentiated this from everything that came before was Call of Duty has always been sort of like a um a sort of procession of like fast-paced corridors, shooting galleries where you're just blasting from one explosive set piece to the next. With this, you're you're in sort of like this abandon well, you're in Chernobyl, so you're sort of in like the abandoned fairground slash apartment blocks. and you're slowly sort of navigating around in the tall grass in your ghillie suit using your sniper rifle to have to take out enemies and it just pulls the pacing all the way back so it's so it's it's slow and it's considered And there's there's like moments when you're prone in the glass, uh grass, sorry, like the Russian army sort of surrounding you. And traditionally, you know, in that scenario in a Call of Duty game, you'd get up and you'd, you know, a firefight would would ensue. But in this, you just have to be silent, you have to be still and you have to hold your breath and it's nerve wracking in the best possible way From that, you know, you've got some like really uh hyper-skilled sniper rifle sections where you're either picking off like enemies who are surrounding the the apartment block or other snipers. There's even a point where you can uh sniper a helicopter pilot who's coming after you. So you still get that bombastic high cinematic action in there within this much quieter, much slower, much more precision sort of focused COD level. It's it's it's sort of representative of of something Infinity War did really well, which was sort of have this ebb and flow of of the action from going faster slow, introducing new mechanics, stuff that later COD didn't do quite as well. Or got lost too much in the story, whereas this, it was that perfect balance of the gameplay with the story, with the characterization. And yeah, it's it's for me the the sort of standout COD campaign moment of the entire franchise

Samuel
02:48:53
Yeah, I mean this is so good it's kind of amazing it's still on the board really, but then I think this is a uh you know, kind of the category that the draft exists for in some ways. Not necessarily for Ash maybe, but I think it's as strong as Ravenholm it's just um you know it's just a different type of FPS so they they both reinvented the like the

Dave Scarborough
02:49:11
shooter job or in a in the in different ways, I would say. But like I I it was it was my my top four list was Titanfall Two, Gillied Up Uh, the D-Day Landing and Raven Holmes. So like I was I had a good amount of choice left over despite having one of them killed.

Samuel
02:49:29
Yeah, if I could kill this one too, I would date. I know you fucking would. Um that's why I was left it till last. Well then that's the draft done So thank you, gentlemen. It is uh uh been a three hour ordeal yet again, so I appreciate your patience and once again you each really earned your eighty quid, so thank you. It's not about the money. So last thing to do then It's about the fans. It is absolutely Dave. So the last thing to do is just to read out who picked what to help the listeners decide. I will Put this on patreon. com slash backpagepod, it's a free post, you don't need to pay money to sign up and read it, it will just be there as a for reference and It will say who picked what. Um don't scroll down if you if you get the Patreon email on Friday morning and you want oh wait, no, you would already have Read the email before you listen to this. That's not gonna work. I'll put loads of like images in of like Wario or something to distract you from reading it before the spoilers begin. But we'll do it in the order of picking then, which was me first. Ash second, Dave third, and Matthew last. And um yeah, we'll just go through category by category. So category one, first person shooter level single player.

Samuel
02:53:59
I thought about picking World's Edge when it had the train on it in Apex Legends, but I just didn't think anyone would care in the in the Discord. Uh whereas uh picking something old that people know and like, I think is kind of the way to go with that and The nostalgia play is probably better than trying to be like, hey, it's me, Mr. Live Service guy. No one wants to be that guy, and no one wants to really vote for that guy, I don't think. So that's the um I think that kinda makes sense it panned out that way. But yeah. But thank you very much, Ash and Dave. We'll see you again in May for the N sixty four and GameCube draft. Yes. That's if Ash can still run Discord on his ancient um uh Mac by then.

Matthew

02:54:44
Oh it's quick it's quick for you, Dave, but it's like dog years for Matthew. It's like he take it takes a toll on him editing these dra these drafts together. It's only a breezy three and a half hours for me. Where can people get you on social media Ash?

02:54:57
Um on Blue Sky I am Games Black Hole and I'm also on Letterboxd as I believe Jelly Scare.

Lovely stuff. And uh yeah, if you you want to see someone reviewing some sixty-year-old Japanese monster films that Ash is your guy.
